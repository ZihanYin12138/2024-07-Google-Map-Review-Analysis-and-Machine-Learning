We just finished the Miss Jezebel room with Katy and had a great time. We were all a little nervous about doing a room with an actor, but Katy's Jezebel (and [redacted]) was great fun.

Little tip: come dressed to the nines. Your host is particular.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I love the 60out Escape Rooms! I've been to the Marina Del Rey location a few times and was very impressed. This was my first time at this location, and it did not disappoint either.

First off parking is very easy. There's a huge free attached parking lot. They have a few different rooms of varying difficulty. We chose the Galaxy Quest room which is by far the hardest room I've ever done. It is very different from many of the other rooms that I've done.

60out is great, and I can't wait to do some of their other rooms.< /review>< pics>

First time going.  Went with my family of 5.  Had a great time.  Staff was really informative and super nice.  Had one daughter that didn't want to go but she ended up having the most fun.  Would definitely go again.</review>

First escape in room in a long time since I've had some bland experiences which led me to stop.

Came to the Jezebel escape room and Pat played a witty and fantastic Jezebel. Had a lot of fun and the puzzles weren't too hard. It flowed really well and I'm gonna start doing more escape rooms again thanks to this. Definitely gonna check out the other escape rooms they have here<//review>

Just did the Tiki Room. If you like incredibly fun rooms that have SIDE QUESTS, then do this dang room. The mechanics are great, the room itself is decorated beautifully, i mean just listen to me and do this room.

Also, Rachel was a killer game master. Everything was set up properly and she was extremely attentive even though we were the last game of the night. Can't say enough good things about this place.

A+, would do this room again if I didn't already know exactly how to do it.<//Review>

This review is specifically for Ms Jezebel. I have not tried any of the other escape rooms at this location. This was my 5th or 6th escape room experience and my first escape room with a live person(I heard there are few other escape rooms like that). It's very different from your other escape rooms. It's like watching theater/show but you get to be part of it! In addition to solving puzzles, you really feel like you are a cast in a murder mystery dinner show.

Our Ms. Jezebel was played by Dorothy. She was an amazing actress! I don't want to say much else cause I don't want to give our spoilers...but she made it super fun.

I think it adds a new and exciting touch to the escape room experience.<//Text>

I've done 2 out of 3 rooms at this location and have been impressed by the creativity and attention to detail in both Ms. Jezebel and Tiki time.

Both are novel takes on escape rooms; Jezebel in particular was a one-of-a-kind experience that I've never seen in the 70+ escape rooms that I've done.

Our GM Patrick was spectacular in the titular role of Jezebel and was a big part in what made the room so incredible. I'm sure the other GMs are also phenomenal as well, but kudos to Patrick for making our night so wonderful!

Tiki time was also great. The room is packed with puzzles and things to do, and the atmosphere and set design was wonderfully immersive.

This location also has plenty of on-site parking which makes it infinitely more convinient than other rooms in L.A. that may require tricky street parking.</review>

<text>Did Miss Jezebel with a party of 5. It was absolutely fantastic. We were all talking and laughing about it for a full hour afterwards in their parking lot (which had plenty of parking), and then well into the night after we got home.

The puzzles made sense, but we still made extensive use of the hint system. The improv was a blast. Shout out to Chloe for a flawless performance! If I had known the "Just the Tip" mailbox was for tips, I would have put something in.

I'd recommend this hands-down to anyone who enjoys some raunchy humor now and then.< /text>< pictures>

This place was a lot of fun.  I've done a lot of escape rooms but this 60out location has somethings I've never seen in other escape rooms.  Awesome job on Krampus and Galaxy Quest.  Unfortunately it looks like they had to take out the Cozmo robot that used to be a part of the game (my friends had played before), but it was still fun none the less.</Text>

<Review>The Service: Very friendly staffs~ Gave us very detail instructions how the game works. We are one of the testing groups and they monitor us through out the game. When they saw us struggling, they would come in the room and give us some hints. They are definitely want to improve the games and make it more challenging and entertaining.

The Game: 45 minutes to find the key and get out the room.... shouldn't be too hard right? WRONG!! This is the time you really really really have to THINK!! Everything in the room can be clues. Love the timer on the big screen TV.... made your heart pounds so fast! We want to escape!

This is a great outing with your family and friends. You can have maximum 10 people per room. It is all about TEAMWORK, people!! If you like to be challenge and love to work under pressure, this is definitely the game for you.

The Parking: Parking in the rear. The store is right next to Etchea Cafe. Huge parking lot behind the building. FREE!!<//Review></record>

It is my go-to for a dive bar that isn't a dive bar. Their Imperial beers are $3 bucks, tall cans of PBR $5. Mixed average around $6-7.  The atmosphere is classy without having to pay for it. It's usually pretty empty, but I don't mind that.<//review>

<text>We did the Galaxy Quest room for my husbands birthday and it was so fun! The inside of it is exactly like what you could imagine a spaceship to look and feel like and there's a fun AI that is there with you for the journey. There's a couple tough parts of it also so it's a difficult puzzle to solve.

There was one light that we needed and it wasn't working so our host came to the rescue and helped us at that point.

Also this location is awesome because there's actual parking in the back. That's almost unheard of for DTLA!

I want to come back and try the Tiki Room here too. The staff was fabulous.<//text>< Pictures>

<Time>1573432302250</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>I've done over 125 escape rooms in Seattle, LA, New Orleans, Houston, and the Bay Area. I actively travel and seek out the best escape rooms in the US, so this review is catered specifically to enthusiasts looking for unique, high quality rooms.

Miss Jezebel - mid 4/5 | Rank 34/145 (Good room with a little something that makes the room distinctive. We will happily recommend these rooms to travelling enthusiasts or locals.)

Miss Jezebel is something like 75% immersive theatre, and 25% escape room. This is probably the first room of this type that we’ve played: Strange Bird in Houston is the other immersive theatre room that comes to mind, but that was more of an immersive theater intro/outro sandwiched by a standard 60 minute escape room. In this room, the game consists almost entirely of interacting with the live actor in the room  (Patrick was great) with a little bit of improv (but it’s easy improv since it’s very obvious what you’re supposed to say/do), with some breaks so that you can do some old fashion escape rooming. The game is advertised as “raunchy”, which means that theres some kinky adult subject matter in the room, and you may have to embarrass yourself by doing certain things. These things aren’t anything beyond PG-13 and pretty tame so don’t worry about that, but you probably don’t want to do this room if you take yourself super seriously.

We personally really enjoyed this room and think it’s unique enough to check out even for enthusiasts who have done a ton of rooms, and thought it was a fresh take on the escape room genre. Spending almost the entire time interacting with the actor was pretty fun even for someone not as sociable like me, and if you’re into comedy/a little bit of improv, you’ll probably have a blast trying to figure out who this Jezebel person really is. I would not recommend this room if you mainly like puzzles or find interacting with people troublesome (though the actor does a pretty good job at reading how into this you are and will probably act accordingly) - the puzzles in the room are pretty basic, and the enjoyment of the room is dependent entirely on you thinking that interacting with the actor is fun (which most people will probably think is fun).

Set - The set is a bit small, but does a good job for the purposes of the game, which is giving you a creepy apartment to work with while you interact with Jezebel. The ambiance is good, there’s some surprises, and it’s generally pretty functional despite most of it being non-interactive.

Story - The overall story is fairly simple (collect evidence vs Jezebel) and is pretty straightforward, the interactions with Jezebel and attempting to have a tea party with her are hilarious and involves some strange and interesting sequences. You’ll need to perform a bunch of simple but funny tasks in order to appease Jezebel, and the conclusion is quite dramatic. There was a ton of story content here in the interactions, and throughout the room I felt like I eventually gained a sense of camraderie with Jezebel, since even though she was crazy, we had some pretty good times together.

Puzzles -There wasn’t a ton of puzzling in this room (maybe 5 or so), and they were all generally pretty simple. Not really the focus of the room, but that’s fine. Some of the puzzles were funny social engineering puzzles where you had to figure out how to do something while not attracting the attention of Jezebel - this was generally pretty easy, but still felt thrilling since there was always the uncertainty of whether or not Jezebel would catch you. There was also a good amount of humor injected into the puzzles which was fun, and one particular puzzle was hilarious in that regard.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

BE AWARE we were walking around until we saw an escape room.On the door it said to ring the bell for service and they did not answer so we left quickly and out of nowhere trying to frighten us was a running man behind us saying to not ring the bell when no one is there. Like how are we supposed to know not to do that. He started to yell at us and saying that what we did was wrong. So ANNOYING
You have to ask us how can we help not when we close that means we close and to let you know you don't have business hour time on the window plus the bell button wrote on it ring for help or services so it is better to not answer if you close not running after customers.<//Text>

Great escape room! Did the Krampus Killer room and had a fantastic experience. A bit scarier than most escape rooms I've done but I loved that aspect. Highly recommended!</Review>

My group and I have done quite a few escape rooms in the LA area, and so far this is definitely one of our top experiences. My only criticism is that in a large group like ours, not everyone is able to be involved with each part of the puzzle, and so it would have been really nice if the room facilitator actually took time after we escaped to recap what happened. As it was, we felt sort of rushed out, without any real time to talk about what happened. But the puzzles were thoughtful and intricate, the mechanics were awesome (it seemed like things happened by magic!) and we were definitely challenged at a good level. Overall a great experience.<//Text>

We had a great time at 60out tonight! The Krampus escape room was a totally immersive and challenging experience from beginning to end. The props, puzzles and attention to detail are amazing. There were even some solid scares that got some screams from the gang. We definitely will be coming back and recommending it to our friends.</review>

thoroughly enjoyed myself here. Countdown Live is located super close to the convention center and if you blink your eye, you might just miss this hot spot.
Free PARKING ! A major perk and unheard of especially in downtown la!

Countdown Live has a total of 3 rooms, Tiki, ( the hardest and biggest room that holds a total of 10 people comfortably) Spaceship, (their most newest room) and Psycho, which is going to be revamp very soon!

I chose the Psycho room with 35% success rate of passing and supposedly the easiest. I enjoy the scary theme as I was barely getting over Halloween. Psycho truly gave us a few screams. I am not going to ruin anything for the rest of you but def. brought out the goose bumps!

I highly recommend paying them a visit!<//text>

We went through the Jezibele room and MY GOSH I've never had a more entertaining room. Having an actor in the room with us spicing things up and adding to the intensity was awesome.< /Review>

Good staffs and nice escape room!!
Probably one improvement point is each program requires many people so to speak...
Perhaps they can make a room for a couple or 3 people.</Text>

<Review>This place was awesome!!  Huge props to whoever designed Krampus.  The ambiance, the lighting, the music, the story.  All of it really just melded together nicely and created an amazing experience overall.  I'm starting to do more and more escape rooms and this is by far the best production value of any room.<//Review><user>100859824226522080892<//user></record></dataset><record>

We did the Krampus Escape room. Although we did not escape, the room is awesome and suspenseful. There is plenty of parking nearby, they offer a free drink just for checking in, and the guy running the front desk is very friendly and funny. I definitely recommend this place if you want a big challenge, yet not overly complicated.< /Text>

<review>Three incredibly themed rooms and FREE parking.

I loved these escape rooms, they have the coolest scenic and thematic in LA. Krampus was better than any haunted house I have ever been to. They also had free parking behind the store, which is so nice!<//review>< Pics>

Did both Galaxy Quest (4 people) and Krampus (5? people). Loved Krampus (probably The best escape I've been to so far). Galaxy Quest was interesting but a bit drier and less atmospheric than Krampus.

The puzzles themselves were pretty interesting, some not too difficult once you get the hang of it, but some still pretty challenging. Luckily you are allowed to ask for hints if you have trouble.< /Text>

This is one of newer escape room in L.A.  located near USC and DTLA which make great for corporate and private event.  They parking is free.  They had 3 room and they all different.  Instead of 60 you only get 45 minutes to exit the room.  The room is nicely done but I wish they are more to do it seem they should lower the price since is 45 not 60 minutes.  However they offer you free soda, water, and even energy drink which is nice.<//text>

My first room escape experience! We all went to the hardest room. It was definitely a challenge, and we were so close to escaping. If only we had five more mins, we would have got it. They do call in to give tips throughout, so that's cool.

Come here, checkin, and get a free drink as well! (Non-Alcoholic)<//review>

I just played the Krampus Room a few hours ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. It was absolutely amazing! When it comes to horror escape rooms I've found that most are either all scare and no puzzles, or all puzzles and no scare. Krampus does a masterful job of showcasing both. The puzzles were interesting, intuitive, and at times pretty difficult with a good combo of more traditional locks and high tech puzzles. At the same time, I was in a constant state of unease throughout the experience and there was more than a few times when that unease quickly evolved into outright terror. Krampus is pretty high ranking in the best escape rooms I've ever played, and it personally takes my #1 spot for horror rooms specifically. Excited to see what else Countdown has in store!<//review>

Edited: Since my review months ago you've changed the escape times from 45 to the full 60 mins. Since then I tried Krampus/others, and congrats you've changed my review to a full 5 stars :) Great job on the rooms. Very happy about the changes. Look forward to trying more rooms when I'm back in town.

P.S Krampus is amazing 🎄Very nicely themed< /Text>

Game night brought up a notch!  This was a lot of fun and a great way to practice team work. I I visited with a the gogobot comunity and we all got seperated into different rooms . I started out my first visit in the hardest room the Tiki Room and we did not solve the last part of the puzzle, but we were so close just a few more minutes and we would have got it :-/  I look forward to going back to try their other rooms.<//Review>

5 stars because they have board games such as chess, 'sushi go! party', and Jaipur, as well as jenga blocks, and a mini pool set, making a fun place to hang out while you drink. The tea here is more about broad flavor (and sweetness) than the subtle nuances of tea variants, so while to my layman's palette it's on par with anywhere else in town, that won't be everyone's experience.</review>

Tried this tea place a few times after CORVID started. The teas don’t come with any toppings—all of them are $0.50 each, except for White Pearl (agar boba) which is $0.75.

As a tea lover, I find the tea flavors not strong enough. The regular boba is pretty chewy. The Tea Mousse is too sweet for my taste. For those who enjoy fruit teas, this might be a good place to visit.

Service is decent. Cashier is usually courteous. But sometimes I would encounter a grumpy staff who wouldn’t even utter a word.< /Text>

Tried oolong milk tea and coffee milk tea. Its below average compared with other tea stores. I personally did not like it. It should have some cheese or Oreos on it for extra taste. They should try something differently

Also the straw perimeter should be wide for enjoying tea with toppings<//Text>

<Text>I got the popcorn chicken, it was thigh\ leg meat, fresh, hot and juicy! The batter is a crunchy\flaky light coating, something like panko, subtle flavor.

It tastes more like actual popcorn chicken rather than traditional Taiwanese salt and pepper chicken (no strong garlic or five spice flavor). $2.99 for a small bag, so a good value, but I probably would pass if I wanted something with more traditional flavor.

Also they don't use skewers, just plastic forks( just fyi)</Text></record></dataset><record>

Chatime is just a cool place to have a casual meal. Their patio might be the best in ER. It's like a backyard picnic. The dogs are solid as are the sweet potato fries. I wish the drink selection would be more expansive but they know their lane and do it well.<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>My favorite bubble tea in San Mateo. They have a dizzying array of options and great service. Plus a wide variety of board games you can play with whoever you bring.

The only weak spot is the food. It's mostly savories, they don't have the egg puffs that other places have.<//Review>< Pics>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Good pearl tea options and very comfy seating. They let you choose how much ice and sugar you want in your drink, which is nice. The pearls are a little sweet and a little chewy, which is pretty much how I like them. They even have a decent food menu. We tried the fried tofu which was different from other chains. It's more like Shake-and-Bake, but it's pretty good.<//Text>< pictures>

Ordered taro milk tea with boba.
I never leave negative comment, but after taking one sip & ask my husband to confirm my thought, I have to. Ended up throwing the thing in trash.
The tea was very very gritty, and the after taste in mouth was nasty. Boba wasn't chewy at all, and some of them was undercooked & was hard inside.</text>

Perfect if you get hot drinks. Chatime never charges extra or change cup size. Other places either do 50 cents extra or a significantly smaller cup, but not Chatime.

Plus this location has some nice chairs to sit in while playing board games with some friends.<//Text>

Great milk tea options and absolutely delicious popcorn chicken.  It's probably the lightest batter of any popcorn chicken I've had at other boba places so it gives it a nice crunch.  Drinks are fully customizable.  No outdoor seating but in a convenient part of downtown San Mateo that can sometimes be hard to find parking around.< /review>

This is probably one of my favorite Boba places in the bay area for the quality of the drinks, food, and overall atmosphere.

What I like:
- Open relatively late for the area (11p)
- Free WiFi
- Good drinks
- Delicious popcorn chicken
- Plenty of seating with couches for groups
- Board games!
- Relatively easy parking (compared to SF)
- Card reader works with Samsung Pay and they have the Square attachment for Apple and Android Pay compatibility!<//Text>

< Review>
Found some coins of my grandmas and did some of my own research on their value. Then I took them to Markham Numismatics. He was quick to respond, friendly and very easy to work with. His appraisals were spot on with my research and very fair. I'd definitely suggest contacting him if you have some old heavy coins you're looking to get rid of and want to go somewhere other than a pawn shop.< /Review>

<text>We were in need of a coin appraiser/purchaser. Howard Markham came to our house for our convenience and spent quite a bit of time going through our recently inherited coin collection explaining what we had. We had values on some and he was right in line with what we thought we would get for those. That made trusting him with the rest of the coins easy. He took time to divide up the coins and explain the value of all. He often gave us the history on the coins which was very interesting. He was a very kind person and my family really enjoyed his company. We were pleasantly surprised at what he paid for our collection. If we are ever in need I would not go to anybody but Howard!</text>< Pictures>

<text>We did a little research, found and liked the reviews we saw for Markham Numismatics. After emailing, Howard quickly got back to us and was able to accommodate our tight schedule with an appointment.  We found Howard to be very friendly, knowledgeable, informative, professional.. and fair. We felt very comfortable doing business with Howard, which helped as we parted with our family treasure. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend his services to anyone.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I appreciated doing business with Mr. Markham for several reasons:
1) Security measures are in place - risk factor of others knowing my business is nil.
2) He's professional, and friendly.
3) He's straightforward, fair, and offers sound advice.</review>

<text>I called and left a voicemail Explaining my husband had passed away and I needed to find out how much His coin collection was worth now that I’m struggling...the guy asked me to send pictures of coins that I had graded from the 1800’s I did and he said I have nothing of value??? That I should go somewhere where they have time to look at it, Because he doesn’t have the time apparently??? I have a very diverse collection and over 18 graded silver dollars that are worth $700 to $2000 each and other silver dollars that haven’t been graded yet paper money and a lot of old coins and proof sets The guy just blew me off🤷🏼‍♀️<//text>< UserId.>

I had a most Wonderful and Pleasant experience with Howard. I found him to be a man of Honesty, Integrity, Sincerity, and he was very straight forward with his information and knowledge of coins. If you are looking to sell coins of worth and value, Howard is the guy to see. His experience with coin collecting is top notch and he will give you what your coins are worth should he decide to purchase coins from you. I would totally do business with him again and would recommend him to anyone looking to sell collectable coins.< /text>

<Review>Needed to sell my brothers coins and silver bars he had left to my parents when he passed. I know nothing about this stuff and didn’t have time to do all the research. Made a private appointment on a Saturday, fit my schedule better. He was wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable and I felt real comfortable doing my business with him and I am not a trusting person at all so that says a lot about him and how he does business. I would recommend him in a heartbeat. If I was not comfortable I would not have made the appointment.</Review></record>

<text>We had never sold valuable coins before and didn't even know where to begin! After researching several different businesses in the area, we decided to try Howard. He met us at his office in Riverside, evaluated our coins and offered us what we considered to be a very fair price based on one appraisal we had on our coins. He was professional and upfront about the business of buying and selling. We would recommend him without hesitation.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcafb16f09c7cd:0xab7f991174bec8af< /gmap_id><Name>Karen Broadway</Name><resp>None</resp><Time>1517090734267< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Went in to see Mr. Markham today and had a great experience.  He is a consummate professional and obviously has a passion for his work.  My collection was small and not very valuable monetarily but he still took the time to go through my collection and give me a fair estimate.  I would deffinetly return if I have any questions or new coin discoveries.  Thank you!< /Text>

Spectacular experience!

I recently inherited several boxes of gold and silver investment coins, and didn't want to let them sit and gather dust. Howard confirmed that the best thing to do was liquidate and take advantage of the current high-interest on long-term accounts.

He went through every stack of coins while I watched, noting number of coins, styles and condition. He was very fast and efficient and paid me on the spot... in an amount that was even greater than my own estimate.

Howard is a true professional, with an obvious lifetime passion for coins and metals. I will gladly recommend his services to family and friends.< /text>

Mr. Markham turned out to be a real gentleman... knowledgeable, courteous, honest, fair and generous.  My wife and I enjoyed our time with him and left happily promising to review his service... I recommend his Markham Numismatics Coin Appraiser business to anybody who is interested in getting the best appraisal and truth of value of your own coin collection... you will get a very fair offer too!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I wanted to convert some of my coin collection into cash and was referred by a friend. I found my entire experience with Markham to be professional and pleasant. It was an easy transaction and I feel I received a very fair price. All my questions were addressed by the knowledgeable proprietor. We both knew exactly what I had and just how to get the deal completed. I will confidently continue doing business with Markham.<//review>

I met Howard Markham about a year ago after seeing one of his ads in a local publication.  I contacted him to sell some of my gold jewelry. We made an appointment to view my jewelry. I found him to be very informed about the industry and a very pleasant man who made me, the customer feel comfortable. After discussing the rate of gold at that time, he examined my jewelry, and gave me a price that I thought was very fair which I accepted.  Since then I've sold other things to him and left feeling happy and respected. I would highly recommend Markham Numismatic to anyone!  I've been to other dealers and Markham Numismatic is by far the best in my opinion.</review>

We had several silver coins and contacted Howard.  He quickly responded and came to our home (since the coins were too heavy for us to tote).  We had researched the coins and had an idea of their worth.   Howard was friendly, answered any questions that we had and paid us what we considered a fair value.   We would not hesitate to use him again.<//text>

VERY disappointed with my experience! He's acts very friendly, but he went so fast and when it was all said and done, I realized that I had been paid less than what he said at the time. I think he knew exactly what he was doing. He will take advantage of you if you aren't careful.

My appointment was at the end of the day and he was closed by the time I realized. I called many times in the morning but it always went to his voicemail. When he finally answered, he told me it was too late to do anything. That was that. I can't believe it would have been such a big deal to fix the situation, but he was stone cold. I feel ripped off.

Just make sure you get EVERYTHING written down and don't let him rapidly use his calculator without showing you an itemized list.</text>

I rarely make recommendations; Markham Numismatic is the exception. I have bought and sold several items from Howard Markham over the years.  I appreciate his professional and laid-back approach where I never feel pressured to buy or sell anything. He is honest, charges a fair commission and has a wealth of knowledge regarding precious metals and collectibles.< /text>

I highly recommend Markham Numismatic LLC for coins and metals! I felt very comfortable working with him, and he knew a lot about what he was talking about. He also had a secure office which made it convenient. I will be returning to him with my future business!</text>

I needed to convert some silver bullion coins into cash, and Howard had the best price.  On top of that, he is very professional and the transaction was fast, easy, and pleasant.  Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Text>I NEED TO ADD A WARNING THIS ESTABLISHMENT USES A THIRD PARTY CREDIT CARD BILLER AND I HAVE BEEN CHARGED TWICE NOW DOUBLE THE BILL BY THEIR COMPANY THE FIRST TIME TOOK TWO MONTHS AND NOW THE SECOND TIME I WAS TOLD NOT TO RETURN AND MY MONEY WAS NOT GIVEN BACK TO ME THE YOUNGER BROTHER NICK SAW THE EVIDENCE AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE WRONG THE OLDER BROTHER FRED WAS OK AT FIRST AND THEN MISINTERPRETED MY APPRECIATION OF HAVING THEIR BUSINESS HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND HAS NOW BANNED ME FROM THE PROPERTY AND WILL NOT RETURN MY STOLEN MONEY. ITS A SHAME BECAUSE I HAVE TWO MORE PEOPLE WHO NOW HAVE COME FORWARD WITH THE SAME ISSUES PLEASE HELP ME BY TALKING SENSIBLY TO THESE BUSINESSMEN WHO SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT LETTING THERE BILLER STEAL IS OK

This is Borrego Springs most places that have been here for awhile do not always give you top service or experiences Now that said Mirage I didn’t know if it was real at first you got Nick always helping knows all his products and if you want something he will get it.  then oh if your lucky enough to meet Fred well this will be earth movin and it will change your life Fred is great he has the largest inventory of non running rental cars for you to chose from and telling n listening to stories well it’s a blast I’m probably there 3 times a day and as a new edition they expanded  they no longer donmechanics work at the moment and this town is in desperate need of competent mechanics. So hey stop in and meet their new fantastic staff.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlzc3-zV781BaMT1m916h3tQ06xRejA5J-03T3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

If you come to Borrego Springs make sure you fill up your gas tank. Just a little ways down the road at the Salton Sea the red Earth casino and gas station has gas for under $2. In Borrego be prepared to pay twice as much.</review>

Our car broke down and these mechanics were so helpful and flexible. I don't know what I would have done without them!< /Text>

Mechanic was nice but the owner is a nut case. Basically held our vehicle hostage for 24 hours then returned unfixed. Avoid Avoid Avoid do not do business with these people.</review>

Scam shop. They will hold your car hostage after an inflated bill. Do not go there. I had to call the police. The manager there is not easy to deal with. Took advantage of a woman from out of town and traveling alone.<//review>

GREAT CLEANERS!!! Have had Alterations and Dry Cleaning done at Flair too, but mainly Monthly Shirt/Blouse Laundry... light starch .... on hangers!! They are SUPER professional, do GREAT work and have great discounts!!! I usually mark all ‘SOILED’ areas with blue painters tape and keep those separate when I bring in the shirts!! They are VERY grateful for me doing this! Your employees are ALL very professional and gracious... but I am partial to Jose at the Redondo Flair!! So happy you are just around the corner from us...<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have to write a good review for people who can do an excellent job for what they do! If you live in the South Bay and ever need a dry cleaning for your valuable clothes, Flair Cleaners in Redondo Beach (1900 Artesia Blvd) is the place you should go! For the end of winter,  I have sent 3 dress shirts, 6 cashmere cardigans, and 2 wool coats for their service.  They provide free pickup and deliveries on the date you choose. Their skills in cleaning, ironing, and presentation are truly high quality and professional! The staff found that I have left a melted candy in the pocket of one of the coats and called me, saying that they will try their best to clean up, and they did! They provide 15-40% discount coupons from time to time so the cost is very friendly.  Amazingly, they delivered all 11 clothes within two and a half days! Also, most of all, they provide non-contact pick up and delivery during the safer-at-home lockdown. I will be their long-term customer!< /review>< Pictures>

They also actually called about an issue with the blanket before they went ahead and cleaned it.  This is just two examples of the excelant service i have received from Flair Redondo Beach since I have started going there.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Flair Cleaners have donea n exceptional job every time we have used them.  We have been clients of theirs since 2002 . The staff is extremely friendly, and will guarantee immediate attention to your dry cleaning, and additionally, if anything goes wrong-which it rarely does- they will make things right< /Review>

Friendly service, fast service. The staff was amazing. Also, the clothes came back in great condition with added touches to keep the cuffs and collars of the dress shirts perfectly pressed! A very positive experience!< /review>

<review>Got my flare jeans tailored and they are the perfect length and kept the same shape which is what I was worried about! I also got shorts taken in and now they fit perfectly! Would definitely recommend their tailoring service to anyone.</review>< pictures>

<Review>So I was getting ready for work this morning, and went to put on my dress shirt. It was then I noticed that Flair Cleaners had sewed my neck button on tighter, and that made me smile. They had noticed it needed repairing when I brought my shirts in to have cleaned this weekend. Truly made me happy. Great job Flair Cleaners, you made this customer's day.< /Review>< Time>

The hours of operation are so great, especially Sunday pick ups. The staff is so pleasant and professional. I've switched laundry S many times before in the past but I am so pleased with the quality of work, pricing, professional service that I consistently receive at Flair that there is no need to go anywhere else. Thank you for being top notch, taking professional care of my clothes.< /Review>

<Text>The service is very professional and extremely well versed in want needs to be done and handled. Delivery was on-time and as expected. Might be a little high in the price to laundered shirts since I'm used to the east coast pricing which is less than half than out west.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Date>

<Review>There is a cherry tree and you pick the cherries off of it. At least I do. Also, you can play there and it's secluded from a road so you don't have to worry about kids or animals  running away. There is also a creek you can explore and of course, lots of picnic tables there too. It's a great place to be!

This is one of the most beautiful parks. I felt very relaxed there. The restrooms very clean and the only complaint would be a small parking lot. Thanks< /review>

<text>Great park to picnic, take in the scenery, play on the playground and use the clean restrooms! Well maintained and safe. Bocce courts are super nice too! Incredibly beautiful open space next to park on one side while a creak meanders along the other.<//text>< pics>

The photos are of nearby Russ Park and the Ferndale Cemetery. It is not a cemetary, ala Stephen King.</Review>

I was referred to MAS Auto Center, by a Great friend of mine Carol.. I stopped in and was happily  greeted right away. Juan helped me with my questions, and was very knowledgeable, and friendly. I felt at home here. I look forward to using MAS Auto Center for ALL my future maintenance and car repair needs. Easy to find, easy access and parking right in front. The poster on the wall stated that
DMV services  are available here also, so you don't have to wait in line, for certain services.<//text>

<pics>None<//pics><username>15 Store</username><Review>Mas Tulare was very helpful in assisting me with a vehicle that was being "over quoted " from the dealer. Getting their opinion on some smog related repairs helped me save over 5K in unnecessary work. I like the approach of  letting me know everything that is going on with my car and what can wait without high pressure sales tactics. I have used this shop before to sublet work too and  appreciate the professional service that  they provide.</Review>< userid>

Polite, professional, and reasonably priced. I needed a smog and a VIN check. They performed both services in about 30 minutes. I would highly recommend this business, and I'll be back for additional services to my vehicles.</text>

Ryan (at the front desk) was able to get my mom's car in to be worked on relatively fast. He kept us very informed and updated on the progress/process of the car while we waited. The Justice Brothers additive Ryan recommended worked extremely well in the car and it saved us a lot on cost! The wait time while my mom's car was being worked on was quicker than most auto shops we have previously been to in the past. Ryan even offered us ice cold sodas and water while we waited. I will definitely be coming back to MAS Auto for all of mine and my family's car needs and maintenances!! Again, I highly recommend MAS Auto Care! 5 out of 5 stars on quality care, customer service, knowledgeable, quick wait times, and pricing!!!!<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>They were able to find out why my vehicle wouldn't stay in third gear. Rodent chewed up wires that shorted a sensor. They were super busy and under staffed so it took a day to get to my vehicle but quality service! My Yukon is driving like a beast again. Thanks.<//Review><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Review>They were very polite and friendly. They were busy but still they made sure that I was aware that I was not forgotten, the male employee offered drinks while I waited. The female employee was professional and told me what steps were going to be taken for my paperwork. I would highly recommend them. It was my first visit.  Thanks MAS.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
One of the things I really appreciate about MAS Auto is their honesty. I've never had them perform a repair that didn't need service, and I've never had poor service. Every time I had to take my car in for an issue it was fixed so that I did not have to return (for the same thing).

The Service Manager, Ryan, is very knowledgeable & explained everything so that I could understand & make an informed decision.

MAS isn't the cheapest auto repair place in town, but they're a lot less than the dealerships & their work is every bit as good if not better.</Review>

The DMV services that they offer here are amazing. It's a great price and would pay more if it meant I never had to go to DMV again. Always helpful and plesant. nothing like the DMV which is why I will always have mas do it</Text>

Great Service, very friendly and knowledgeable. Most places I've gone for smog it takes an hour+. Was in and out of here in 25 minutes (was 1st in line.) That wait time included all the paper work and I have an older car. Will be taking my other vehicle here. Thanks!<//Text>

While waiting for my car, I never saw them be rude or unkind to anyone, even when they were busy. Keep up the GREAT customer service. Also as a woman I have never bren talked down to are treated as a 2nd class citizen. I have been going to MAS for 2 yrs. They do all my major and minor repairs.<//Review>< pics>

<text>There supposed to be a professional shop and don't even know what there responsibilitray is ..will never take a car to them again .might be racial so black look out .well went back after they amited they we wrong still didn't get what I went there for.  Racist shop .........or owner stupid......I wasthis is Tex from manger amitimg wrong .

searching through some of the regulations and could not find a direct reference to the airbag warning light, so if you would like to stop by I would be glad to refund your money. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I will continue to research this to find the correct answer. I don't like doing things wrong. I will make a note in your account showing a $110 credit.<//text>< Pics>

So I went to get my nails done for my 21st birthday February 15 and they lied about what time they could do my nails. She did a mediocre job on my full set nails and also charged me 70$ for the full set. My nails lasted 2 weeks when I first got them done I was happy because I needed them done but on my birthday it looked like I had my nails done for a week but I had them for 2 days. DO NOT GO TO THIS NAIL SHOP.</Review>

Expensive, low quality mani/pedi in a small, run down looking salon. Their basic nail polish was low quality and needed to be removed as soon as I got home. What a waste. Go anywhere else, literally.<//Text>

<text>I've gone to this nail shop primarily for its convenient location, for over a year. The owner is often rude to her clientele. After I saw an elderly woman mistreated,  I knew I could not continue to support this establishment in good faith. I find Tammy's behavior, manners, and customer service  shocking and appalling. Because of its convenient location many regular clients have grown accustomed to the lack of regard and respect for their contribution to this enterprise's success that customers should expect and command. This salon deserves a  boycott. I will not spend my money here and discourage others from spending a dime here either until she changes her ways.<//text>< username>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Do not come here. They are the most racist, dirtiest, nastiest, most unprofessional and rude nail salon I have ever gone to. My friend first wanted to get an ombré set but the rude Asian guy but did not know how to do it so she just asked for a plain French tip. First of all he did not have any white tips so he used clear and had to draw on the white tip which was extremely lop sided and incorrect. I spoke up on behalf of my friend and told him that it was crooked and he got extremely upset and did not want to fix it. Then after he had an attitude fixing it when he was done the other nail was messed up and I told him but he said there’s nothin he can do and he will not fix it, keep in mind he said with an attitude. So as a concerned first time customer I asked him if this was their policy? Is this how you treat your customers? So when a nail stylist messes up on the paint they do not fix it and that’s that? Suffice to say we got into it, he fixed and yanked her finger but her nails are the most ugliest nails ever especially for a simple French tip for $40. That’s the most easiest thing to do. And on top of it all another woman who was black was being mocked and ridiculed by her nail stylist who was another Asian man. I was like wow. And the nail salon was extremely dirty full of dust. They do not use new appliances which can cause infections. I do not recommend this shop to anyone.<//text>< pictures>

Terrible experience.  You do not get PROFESSIONAL SERVICE.  Best EMPLOYEES have left.
You pay a LOT for a LITTLE.  Acrylics seem to be all they know how to do.< /Text>

Tapas were all amazing. Service was top notch. The French onion soup was the best thing ever!! The beer menu was a bit small. Great place to eat over all.<//review>

Oh my gosh, what a find!  Fresh ingredients and attention to detail,  Evan makes the best cocktails in OC!  And the food is really delicious.  The best bacon wrapped dates I've ever had! Atmosphere and music are great.   Will definitely be back!<//Text>

I meet with friends this restaurant from time to time! This is the best place to dine.  I visit this place frequently. The cooking is great, the crew is helpful and the charge is good. I like eating in this restaurant over a decent dinner.<//Text>

Fun to sit at the bar and watch the chef's cook! Their new location is bigger and has a nice outdoor patio dining area. We love to share a few tapas, salad and dessert.  The Sangria is delicious and service is right there whenever you need them.</Text>

I thought it was clever their menu groups food by Earth Land & Sea The food was unusual- not combinations I'd seen before. The staff was very friendly and provided great service. I enjoyed the food but would have added a pinch more seasoning to the chicken and french fries. Just my personal taste but I recommend you try it yourself!</review>

A very amazing hole in the wall type place. The food was amazing, the service was amazing and the prices were incredibly cheap. If you are in the area looking for great food and an informal setting, I highly recommend stopping by and trying this place.<//review>

Got takeout. Food came quickly and everyone inside was friendly. The veal sliders and margarita pizza was good. Truffle fries was good too but hoped for a little more truffle flavor.< /Text>

I'm back in town on a new project and had to go back (especially since my wife joined me for our anniversary). As always the food was exceptional as is this staff! Tuna Tatar my favorite as are the specials. Worth the wait.< /review>< pictures>

Osteria Mamma is all about the experience.  Don't come if you're hungry, grumpy or with bad company.  Dinner will take a while.  But, if you come with the right expectations and the right dinner companions, it can be fantastic.<//Review>

food: ee ordered salt cod churros, beet quesadilla, shirt rib, salmon belly sandwich, and duck confit. we had different opinion about the food. although the general quality was good, we were not impressed with short rib bowl as much. it was more like stew. we really liked the churros , loved the salmon sandwich, and liked the duck dish. their snagria waw also really great. they tr wasted our bride with champagne.< /Review>

The Black Trumpet Bistro was the perfect spot for a book club lunch! Some of us are regulars of this local favorite and those in our club that were new to the dining experience are now converts. We spent more time discussing and trying each other’s dishes than we did our book selection and this is a group with some amazing home cooks so that is quite a testament to the menu!
Dino is not just the owner of this exceptional restaurant; he is a true chef who works his magic in the kitchen daily. Interesting flavor combinations, unique sauces, high quality ingredients, and numerous daily specials featuring some bold dining choices are the reasons why Dino has a VERY loyal following both at Black Trumpet Bistro and his other establishment in Huntington Beach, Capone’s Italian Cucina. Friendly service, fair prices, and a warm ambiance don’t hurt. We look forward to our next meals at both of these favorites!</Text>

THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN HB. I heard a lot of great things about this restaurant but never checked it out. I finally had the opportunity to come here with my girlfriend and we were both really impressed not just by the food but with the customer service and the ambiance of the restaurant. We ate like Kings and decided to try a lot of the popular items on the menu. As Guy would say, welcome to "flavor town". EVERYTHING was delicious. My favorite thing and the best bang for your buck is the cheese plate, so many different flavors and textures. But you can't go wrong with the tapas menu. Great spot to bring a date, I highly recommend this place!! Shout out to Kale, he's the man< /review>

Such a wonderful place for brunch. We sat outside on the patio. It's  fun to people watch from there. Our food was great.the best lobster bisque that I ever had. Very thick with a hint of sherry. My husband had the eggs benedict and said they were delicious.Our server was very friendly. You must try the ginger agave soda. It was the perfect refreshment to complete brunch. Highly recommend  Seasons 52.<//text>

Enjoyed the upscale atmosphere and cool "jazz meets winery" themed decor while sipping wine at the bar.  We were seated pretty quickly considering it was a Saturday night, and our server, John, did a great job explaining the specials.  The four of us ate Tapas style and our favorites included the Halibut (special), Lobster rigatoni, and the veal meatballs.  We brought our own wine ($18 corkage) and loved the dessert (banana-nut-chocolate) It was delicious!< /review>< pictures>

<username>Kitty Love< /username><Date>1526503492513< /Date><rating>4</rating><Review>Medium sized restaurant, moving soon. Comfortable atmosphere, great seating options. Cool decor.

You'll die over their calamari. It's perfect. Tuna tartare is just under the borderline of too spicy. Lamb meatballs (today's special) are a bit too spicy for my mom. If you're spice sensitive, order some milk!

The servers know the menu and food really well.
Ridiculously friendly, not pushy.

Mom says they don't take reservations. If you come for lunch during the week, you won't need one anyway. Avoid dinners and weekends.

Really good at accommodating (nut) allergies. I will be back.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Came here randomly for lunch as I was on a lunch break from working out in Huntington Beach. I really loved the name of the place. I went in and was so suprised to see the place packed! That's always a good sign. I just had the Kale salad, which was amazing. I'm not ususally into salads too much (especially Kale), but my waiter told me it was one of his favorites so I gave it a try. Yum Yum! It was very good & I was very impressed! So 2 thumbs up for Black Trumpet!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1570222981713, 'text': 'Thank you for visiting both restaurants.

<Review>We both love this bistro! The variety on the menu is international/mediterranean.  My husband never would eat brussels sprouts until he tried them at Black Trumpet. I love the  Lamb Lollipop and the duck breast (served with a pomegranate reduction that perfectly compliments without overpowering) are my person favorite from the Land portion of the menu. The portions are perfect for a romantic share!< /Review><userid>105545183282388559007<//userid>< Time>

<Review>I love tapas. There are so many delicious choices. Be sure to order from the specials if any of them look good. Plenty of parking as it is in a strip mall area. Good environment. Usually don't have to wait at all if you go on a weekday. It is small though and be prepared for it to be dark like most fancier restaurants are to add ambience. Right after sunset though they lift up the blinds and it's really nice then.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Loved this place! Went here for our anniversary dinner and had lamb dishes, which were both delicious. Ambiance was romantic and the staff was super friendly. Great wine as well.<//Review>

Killer food. Great environment. A must try for our area! The lamb chop tapas are to die for. Actually you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, the chefs are amazing. Great ambiance. Ask them to pair your wine with your food for an delectable meal.< /review>

Amazing. Snuck in on Valentine's Day unexpectedly, with kids while here at a conference. The manager came to greet us, told us there was some interesting flavors to try, some even a little weird, and all would be good. Then he have my wife a single rose for Valentine's Day. He was right. We had special stuffed Risotto, Salami Pizzete, Beef Wellington, Brussel sprouts and some amazing banana chocolate dessert. All to die for. Try it, or regret it.</text>

<review>I love Tapas food.  I love sitting at the chef bar where you can watch them create the beautiful and yummy food.  They have a great selection of wines at a reasonable price and the service is exceptional.

Lamb lollipops, pan roasted duck breast, Sicillian stuffed mushrooms, truffle fries, tuna tartar to share and much more!!  I'm making myself hungry!!<//review>< Pics>

I love this place! Food was delicious and the atmosphere/ambience was nice. They have an amazing wine selection even though I don't drink. Food was fresh and comes out steaming hot. The dessert selection was great. They bring out a tray of desserts for you to choose from. I had the raspberry/strawberry cake with coconut. The cake was moist and fluffy and the sauce was sweet and tart, delicious!</Review>

Exceptional!

This is one of those small places that you feel you must write about to give them their due, but you hate to tune in more people to this place because they are already packed for business. But alas, must do the right thing...

The food here was absolutely incredible - top to bottom. I thought I was at the CIA (culinary institute) having dinner. It just had those perfect chef touches on each dish.

We had several of the tapas plates for appetizers and the the main meal. I enjoyed the Steak Frites with a juicy, perfectly trimmed and cooked Sirloin. My wife had the special which was fish and said it was amazing.

Very good wine menu to accompany the food with a nice bar area that fills up quickly.

Just know, if you go on the weekend after 6, you will be waiting outside for a table for awhile. It's unfortunate but speaks to how good this place is.< /Text>

Every time we visit the Black Trumpet we are never disappointed.  Never mind that the menu is crafted by one of the great chefs here in America, if not beyond, Dino. He's always available and will often come and say hello and shake your hand. That's when you get the opportunity to share with him how perfect his food is and how wonderful are his staff. They don't take reservations and they are open for lunch too. They have an extensive wine list as they are a wine bar and now they will be serving mixed cocktails. We stumbled upon this great Bistro a couple of years ago before it made its move to Seacliff Village. I believe we have been there at least 12 or 15 times. Always a great evening without exception! We always have the clam and mussel appetizer with the smoked French bread that is toasted, it is hard to describe how delicious is this dish. This last visit my husband had the Coltrane which is a filet mignon with french fries and as usual it was flavorful, tender, and a large portion. I tried something new as I was hungry for rotisserie chicken. The Cornish game hen was unbelievably savory tender and with perfect and crispy skin. Served with saffron pilaf and mixed vegetables including asparagus. The handcrafted fair at this restaurant is beyond five stars and consistent. The ambiance in their new location is also like an exciting French bistro. There is an outdoor patio with a fire pit or indoor dining where you feel as if you're in a French nightclub. We love sitting at the bar or at the open kitchen where the chefs are always friendly and love to entertain. I can't say enough about this extraordinary  gem in Huntington Beach. Romantic, comfortable, inviting and you always feel like you've arrived at a family home restaurant.  Plenty of parking and wheel chair accessible. Don't miss this one for a wonderful occasion or just a date night out!</Review>

Came here on a Friday evening with a small group of friends after a glowing recommendation from a friend.

The ambiance was super cute. It's a very small and cozy restaurant, but what i loved most was how the service never felt rushed and attention to detail! They have an amazing wine list to compliment their extensive menu. The menu is definitely both veg and non-veg friendly which was a huge win for our party.

While they are a small restaurant, expect to wait and enjoy a glass of wine from their bar. They also do not take reservations.

For dinner, we shared family style and ordered numerous items. Items included:
- Baked Brie
- Truffle Fries
- Daily Special (Eggplant Parmesan)
- Daily Special (Lamb Kebobs)
- Brussels Sprouts w/ chorizo o the side
- Fig Pizza

Everything turned out AMAZING! The food comes out as plates are hot and ready, so don't expect this to all come out at once. Definitely more of the tapas style.

Overall, amazing food, wine selection and dessert selection! So glad we finally came here and will definitely be back again for more food soon!!</text>

The chicken, onion soup and desserts are excellent.  However, the hummus is liquidy and the falafels are a bit dry and salty.  Atmosphere is cool, but they really have to do something about the smell in the men's bathroom.  Although the men's bathroom was very clean it smells like there's a gas leak.</Review>

Great Chef, menu, decor, wines and beer (no mixed drinks yet..but pending)... generally very busy after 530. Because of very reasonable prices and delishes gastro pub sized portions.. probably one of the top places to eat in the OC.< /Review>

Sandwich pretty authentic and flavorful. Cauliflower was as good as cauliflower gets! Small place in a strip mall that could not accommodate parties over 4-5, 34 people total. $20-$30 per person before drinks.</review>< UserId.>

The Black Trumpet is truly a medditeranian marvel. With a fantastic staff and atmosphere, great music, and some of this best tapas this side of the Atlantic, The Black Trumpet will satisfy everytime. This place became in an evening, a regular spot for personal friends and family. Almost tempted to give a negative review purely in keeping this place a secret, but my love for the food gave me no choice but to speak truly and ensure its continued success.</review>

<Review>At first glance, this restaurant's interior doesn't say much but once you enter you'll be surprised by how busy it is.

I was casually looking for a place to eat for date night and found this restaurant black trumpet bistro.

Interior decor looks nice. Very much like a nice bistro.  We were seated on chef's table because it was so busy.  Chef's table - there you can see them at work making your meal.  They were fast in getting our appetizers and entrees out.

I don't think the truffle fries were worth it.  There was no flavor in the fries and tasted more like garlic fries.  Duck breast appetizer was totally worth it.  The right amount of fat and protein.  Tasty!

Had lamb shank and it was ok.  I thought it was a little too salty but otherwise it was very tender.  Figs were a nice touch.  I've never had figs with my entree before.

Fiance had kabob.  At first he was worried one stick of steak kabob was not enough but actually it worked with w the veggie kabob and the meat chunks was pretty big.

Overall it's a nice place to check out.  Will recommend people to come a little early for better seating.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd26c3c1507f5d:0x177ef0d65f0ea6a5<//gmapID></record>

<text>Went here on a recommendation from a friend.  Food was outstanding!!!  Great place and the service was outstanding, we sat at the bar.  Its a small place with a great feel to it... had the mushrooms, lamb chop, brussells, trout...it was way better than I was expecting. This could be my new favorite rest. in HB<//text><rating>5< /rating>< resp>

A delightful, dim, and romantic little bistro that serves up the most amazing tapas dishes alongside 1950's jazz. It's an adventure every time I go and I'm slowly working my way down the menu with every visit! Service is top notch and the servers really know their stuff when it comes to dishes and their flavors. Don't be afraid to ask for their recommendations if it's your first time! My recommendations: sangria (get a pitcher!), the chicken skewers, beef carpaccio, pizzette fichi, and something off their specials of the night. Whatever you get, you won't be disappointed!<//review>

So I went inside.  There is no hostess station.  A waiter walked by and ignored me.  I was able to get the eye of someone in a white chef's coat but he kept chatting with a couple of customers.  Everyone in the restaurant ignored us, soooo, I left.< /Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1564281327482, 'text': 'Hello\nFortunately your review is the only 2 star review we have ever received. I would like to know why? What was wrong? What didn’t you like about my restaurant?\nHaving a bad dining experience at a restaurant – sucks. What sucks even more is being an owner or employee at a restaurant and discovering that a negative review has been left about my establishment that you pour your heart and soul into week in week out.\nI’m not telling anybody not to leave negative reviews, I’m just going to attempt to shed some light on the situation from the point of view of the people who the reviews impact the most.\nFor you it’s 5 minutes out of your day that you spend tapping away at your keyboard and letting hundreds (if not thousands) of people know how you had “the WORST meal EVER”, and how Sally didn’t bring you water after you asked “3 TIMES!!!!!” Or how you had to wait. There are many restaurants that do not accept reservations. and letting the world know that you “will NEVER EVER be back!!!!!” – you click ‘post’ and carry on with your day, perhaps totally unaware of the emotional and financial impact that your review may have on the people that it’s aimed at. Negative reviews have the potential to be soul crushing for the people on the receiving end, we have probably worked extremely long hours in very stressful conditions and have probably done a great job and been able to provide a great experience for 99% of our customers. We might send out 400 meals in a day under very rushed and stressful conditions, if just 1 of those 400 meals is less than perfect there is a chance that the poor chef will be persecuted in the form of a bad review online. How many other occupations exist where one mistake that you make at work will be posted online for thousands of people to read about?\nThe hospitality industry is a tough one – high stress, low profit margins, a nation-wide shortage of qualified or experienced staff and far more establishments than there are customers to fill them. The stress within our industry is widely documented.\nI am. Or trying to make you  feel sorry for me and or any one from my restaurant , and all other restaurants that you have left a bad one star review, I just often wonder when I read a negative review if the person writing it would have a change of heart if they knew the amount of hard work and stress that’s involved in running a restaurant (and yes things sometimes do go wrong). Hospitality professionals are a tough bunch, most negative reviews are brushed off like water off a duck’s back (and any actual constructive criticism noted). Sometimes however a negative review really can be the straw that broke the camel’s back. A negative review when you’re exhausted from working long hard hours really can compound the stress so much more and lead to many sleepless nights, agonising over what you could’ve done to avoid that review. Owner/operators of venues also have the added anxiety of wondering about the financial implications of negative reviews (in an industry where margins are very tight as it is).\nThere are far more effective and constructive ways of providing feedback at a restaurant than writing an online review. It is amazing the amount of people who will fail to mention that there is any problem whilst at the restaurant but then go home and absolutely crucify the establishment on social media. Yourself and the restaurant have a common goal which is for you to have an enjoyable experience, if something isn’t up to scratch let us know! Something can be done – a new meal made, a refund given, a sincere apology – none of this can happen however if the first time they hear of a problem is via an online review.\nSo please, before writing that scathing review – ask yourself a few questions:-\n* Have you ever made a mistake at work? Was the mistake broadcasted in the form of a review for thousands of people to read?\n* Did you give my restaurant ample opportunity to rectify the problem at the time?\n* Is a review the most constructive way to voice your concerns? or could you call the restaurant and speak to a manager?\n* Does the punishment fit the crime? (the crime being whatever happened that deemed it an unsatisfactory experience – the punishment possibly being prolonged emotional and financial strain for numerous people)\nI hope that I’ve been able to give you a glimpse into what can happen after a negative review comes through from the point of view of us on the other side and maybe it will make a couple of people think twice before unleashing their nasty negative review.\nI wish you the very best.\nDino Ferraro\nChef/ proprietor'}<//response>

This is the most understanding, professional and quick.  All the staff is well as experienced so your nobody’s practice client here.
I’ve been getting Botox for 6 yrs. years.  I will definitely be back because unlike any other Botox place that I’ve been to I’ve never been offered incentives. I absolutely think this a flexible, clean and professional place especially fir first timers. I recommend it to anyone. I love this find, it’s a gem. I also want to thank all the staff for treating me with respect even though I came wearing swats and an unmatched shirt lol. Very good people!<//Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Went today for PRP/Microneedling at the Westwood location and loved it! The staff and doctor were so friendly and a blast! The doctor also was so helpful - I had originally booked PRP with injections and most doctors just do whatever the patient says, but he told me that it was too much and unnecessary and to opt for the PRP/Microneedling. I so appreciated his care and guidance. Thank you all!!<//text>< resp>

<Review>The owner makes  some off-color jokes.
Tell guests don’t pay from Groupon.  Pay him directly. And all the list on Groupon doesn’t work.  You have to pay higher price.  The service is terrible.  Numb cream only 10 minutes. They would not waste time on you. Then you will feel very hurt.  After treatment you will find your skin is worse than before.    I did Ultherapy at the other store before.  It’s the worst one
Don’t go there< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Please visit Ramin at the Westwood location. This was my first time having any type of experience with fillers. I am completely new to all of this and Ramin was able to walk me through everything. Excited to see the way my lips heal. Ty for everything.< /review>

<review>Today was my 2nd time I went to Alliance Health Choice in Westwood, I love that place!! The combination of knowledge, professionalism, great friendly attitude is something that every girl needs choosing her perfect "health choice"  plus don't forget about the pricing, so far the prices are the best in entire Los Angeles!!!   I highly recommend nurse Gia: fast, professional, explains everything to small details and does an amazing job!!
The owner is amazing as well. Hands on, makes sure everyone feels comfortable. I hardly ever write reviews, but I had to make sure to spread my words about wonderful work they all do!
Thank you so much!!</review>< pictures>

Worst place. Terrible customer service. The woman in a white coat is really rude.
She didn’t even put numbing cream on my face before they injected the filler. I asked for the numbing cream because she was trying to do it without it and then she was aggressive and told me like
WHY do need numbing cream. Tell me why.

I was like is this woman kidding me lol
No place has ever done anything on my face without numbing the area.
I don’t know if she was trying to save the numbing cream or be mean.</Review>

If only I could give this place 10 stars!!!! Everyone that works here is soo kind and treats you with great care. I have so far been here once for micro needling w/ PRP and once for micro needling w/ PRP and Ultherapy for under eyes bags. The Ultherapy wasn’t even part of my scheduled appointment and they were more than happy to accommodate me. ALSO! My results with Ultherapy were immediate!!! I couldn’t believe how much better my under eyes looked. I’m 27 and have struggled with severe under eyes bags because of genetics and when I saw my results 10 minutes after the treatment I wanted to cry 😭❤️ I couldn’t believe how amazing my under eyes look. One thing that I love about this place is they will not try to sell you on products and procedures you don’t need. I told them the goal I’m trying to achieve and not really wanting to use any fillers and they managed to figured out other alternatives to help what I’m trying to achieve. I strongly recommend coming here!!!! Will be coming back soon!!! Thank you everyone at Alliance Health Choice Westwood!!!</Text>

I have been coming here for over a year. They always try and accommodate changing schedules and do their best to fit you in. Every nurse I have had has been fabulous. Their prices are the best out there but that has no reflection on the level of service or quality of product. I have brought my mom and friends here and everyone has left happy. It’s always nice leaving feeling better about yourself. Thanks everyone!< /Text>

I’m a new patient having had radiesse injections done on my cheeks before. I knew pretty much the areas I wanted to focus on. I asked for the injectors opinions and she listened to mine. We agreed on the areas and the injector made sure to address them.  I told them I’m a baby with pain so they lathered me up with lidocaine, gave me a stress ball to squeeze, and talked to me to distract me from the pain.  She used up most of the syringe, showed me the results, and offered that I can save the .3 cc left in case I wanted to come  back for a touch up or evenly distribute the remainder. I chose to use the rest right there but I liked that she checked with me before using all of it and gave me the option. The place was pretty busy, but staff was friendly. The price of $325/ 1.5cc syringe is honestly a really great price for LA or OC. I’ll definitely come back the next time it’s needed.</Text>

I came here from Colorado and had a great time. Everyone was so friendly Frim Megan the nurse that did my lips, to Gia that made me feels comfortable during my Ultherapy. Ramin was nice too and helped me figure out what procedure was best for me. The girls Dayana and Brittney at the front desk were so sweet! Def recommend this place and is affordable.<//Review>

This place is terrible! I came here to get lazer resurfacing and I had a 300+ group-on I bought. They only did one pass over my face and gave me no after care kit or any advice of the proper way to care for my face during recovery. On top of it all zero results! I mean absolutely no differences. $300 down the drain.< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2bb82eb1d8177:0xd3aa7e8d2dcbe7a2<//Gmap_id><Text>Discriminates against Groupon and used my health as leverage to deny service.

I wanted to leave a review in regards to Freeze The Fat Dr. (Westwood). Unfortunately, it was one of the worst experiences I’ve had with a business in the LA area.

After a few weeks of researching Ultra Sonic Cavitation, I called their hotline to clarify the logistics of the deal (their Groupon page is very sparse. It simply says treatment can be provided on any area and what the procedure is.) This organization also discriminates against Groupon users (booking them months out, when they have open appointments). One of the owners, Ramin Broukhim, was impatient and less than happy to answer my questions. He quickly assured me cavitation would be best and confirmed that I could choose multiple treatment areas for my session (like two small areas). I took notes on ALL of this. He then abruptly told me he had other people on the line he had to get to and to schedule a consultation. I was left feeling stupid, as if I’d disrupted his work by asking about a procedure being done to my body. Despite the red-flag phone manner, I purchased the Groupon and scheduled my consultation.

I show up to the consultation, well-researched and ready to be medically cleared. The woman at the front desk opens my voucher before the treatment (something that voids a Groupon). I’m then taken to a room and asked to sign paperwork, without any explanation of it. Next, the medical assistant tells me I should do cool sculpting instead of the cavitation. I declined, happy with the cavitation, but she continues to try to sell me on it. I then became confused that I had chosen the wrong procedure. Frustrated, she tells me I can do the cavitation if I want, but I wouldn’t see many results (opposite of what I was told on the phone.) She also confirmed I could try two treatment areas (small tummy area and a few inches on my thigh); it might just take longer to see results, which I was ok with. As far as medical clearance, I was only concerned with a small cyst I had. The other owner, Nadia Goel, came into address: “Don’t worry sweetie, the cavitation doesn’t penetrate that deep, you’ll be fine!”

Then things start to turn – as I’m changing, Nadia tells the medical assistant she’s not to treat both areas. I need to choose one. I let them know I was counseled otherwise (via phone and the medical assistant). It becomes a back and forth, due to the miscommunication. I then apologize and let them know with the new information, I’d be happy to do a single area for my first treatment – but to please specify this on the phone, with the medical assistant and on their Groupon page in the future to avoid confusion. No big deal.

During the entire process, Nadia refused to take ownership of the information passed along on the phone – essentially calling me a liar. Telling me I didn’t understand the process I was there for. She went so far as calling the other owner and telling him that I was lying about him during the appointment. She berated me, disrespected me and sent me into tears. She then tells her medical staff to pull out all the equipment from the office and that she wouldn’t be treating me.

I kept my cool and simply repeated: “I understand the treatment. I had just been misinformed. Please make the correction to your phone service and website in the future.” Two of the medical assistants tried to get involved on my behalf (I thought maybe it was a language barrier) to clear up the miscommunication, but she came back in and told me to get out of her office and slammed the door in my face. Again, I’m sitting on the table – crying, unsure of why I was now being kicked out for asking for clarifications in a CONSULTATION.

I call owner Ramin Broukhim to explain the situation. He tells me they won’t “bother touching me” because of my cyst. I’m a liability. I inform him that I was told differently in the office by Nadia.

Either they were going to clear me (when I shouldn’t have been) to get my business – or are they were using the medical issue to deny me service. Unethical either way.<//Text><userid>107008627064365793216<//userid>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I’m getting ready to go back for my 2nd treatment (a birthday treat I’m “meant” to have!😄).  The 1st was about 6 mos ago and I’d like too share my experience!

First off, the office was clean and the reception welcoming, making me feel immediately at ease ( I’m always a bit nervous!).  I was called back within minutes and met my wonderful nurse, Zohreh.  I had so many questions and she was so patient and friendly, not only taking her time, but listening and taking my concerns seriously.  I did a little Botox, Juvederm and Voluma and Zohreh informed about how long each would take to fully present and last.  When I was finished, the Doctor came in, introduced himself, and made sure I was happy, very sweet man😊.  As I paid, there was no push for rescheduling and no high pressure sales during the whole visit.  Just super nice and knowledgeable from beginning to end!
Oh yes, almost forgot!  There prices are the best I’ve seen!  You won’t be disappointed and a note to the first timers; remember to be patient, results can take at least 2 weeks to fully realize (especially Botox).  So if you are off to the Bahamas, book your appointment in advance!!<//text>< pics>

Unprofessional and inconsiderate of people’s time. I drove all the way to this location for my appointment and they said they can’t see me because I bought a Groupon for my procedure through Groupon and not w them. Completely denied me service and discriminated against me. I’m reporting them to the Better business bureau. A business shouldn’t promote through a 3rd party if they aren’t going to honor the purchase. Shady and dishonest. I’ve never had this happen to me before so I have to look into what the legality is of this fraudulent bait and switch. By the way you can buy their Juvederm lip filler for only $243 with a Groupon+ account and get a $50 bonus to use towards travel. At least that was the AMAZING deal I got. Even if they matched the price I’m sure they wouldn’t have given me a bonus 50 bucks. It’s their loss, if it went well today I would have asked them for other fillers/procedures. Oh well, I got Groupon to issue a refund and I’m going to spend it at another business. Finally, and most importantly, between the front desk, the doctor and patients there were 7 people crammed into a waiting room the size of a bathroom during a pandemic. I was immediately uncomfortable and had no problem walking away from this place. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS.<//Text>

< review>
This was my first time EVER getting fillers. I had been thinking about it for a long time and when I decided one day, I chose by whoever was able to book me that day. NOT the best way to choose, but I honestly thought it was a quick "lunchtime procedure" with no side effects. I FREAKED out when I had bumps that wouldn't go away two days later. I didn't know it was normal, and looked online where I saw the worst case scenarios. I texted with the guy who works the front desk (the manager)-- he was so nice, told me not to worry and that if I want I can go to their Tarzana office that day (where he's located on Wednesdays... I had gone on Monday, in Westwood).I went, they told me it's normal, but to wait a week and that if I still don't like it I can have it dissolved at no cost. That made me feel a lot better. A week later the bumps were gone and had no need or desire to have it dissolved. I LOVE my results. My cheeks look a bit fuller but not TOO noticeable, which is what I wanted. The doctor said I need more, but I think this is okay because I don't want people to be able to notice it too much. I am way more confident smiling in my selfies because instead of a sunken face I have these nice, rounded cheeks now. :) The only reason I give them four instead of five stars is because they didn't give too many after-care instructions as I later saw on YouTube that such doctors give, even knowing it was my first time; I had to ask all the questions and learned as I go. Still, they were great and if I decide to do this again I will definitely go back!</review>

Came is for the first time today for Lip fillers and I looooved it! The staff, Drs and Nurse were all very nice and friendly, the Dr made sure I was comfortable and explained exactly what I was paying for and what to look for if I ever go anywhere else. My drive here was over an hour but it was so worth it and i will continue to go back! Thank you so much!!<//Review>

<text>I had a wonderful experience. I went in for a cool sculpting consultation, the office manager was mindful and scheduled enough time that if I wanted to move forward with it I could, and I did! Everyone made sure I was comfortable, understood the process, and answered all of my questions. I would highly recommend Alliance Health Choice, and I will certainly be coming back for a face peel.< /text>< gmapID>

Everyone here is professional, kind and empathetic. I have a condition that prevented me from using the Groupon service I purchased. They cared more about me than selling the service. All options including giving the money back, were presented. I chose to have a different service which I really enjoyed. I highly recommend this company.</text>

I would steer clear of this place. My first impression was not positive - the office looked dingy and dirty. The walls and tables were vomiting brochures and posters for products and services. There were a lot of random people walking in and out of the office as if it were some sort of hangout for the other people in the building. I liked the woman who gave me my IPL treatment, so I bought 3 sessions because she said that I wouldn’t see any results from one session. Well, big mistake. Apparently, they have a policy that if you miss your session, they penalize you by charging you full price for the missed session. This policy is not posted nor communicated when setting an appointment, so imagine my surprise when I confused my days and was told I ‘lost’ the session. This is a greedy and awful way of doing business. With so many other med spas who don’t zing you in order to make a buck, scroll past this one and good luck to you.</Review>

Excellent service and prices! The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The woman giving me an IPL treatment helped me with a vitamin C serum and gave me advice on zinc sunscreen and facial cleanser! The Dr was so patient and kind in explaining everything to me. He was happy to work with me on a payment plan too for other procedures. I can't wait to go back for my next IPL.<//Text>

I have now had 2 IPL treatments here.  Both times, I have had a very good experience from walking in to the friendly reception area all the way through to walking out after finishing my treatment.  I was initially a little hesitant due to the amazing prices compared to some other medical spas.  I had worried that I wouldn’t get the same IPL treatment since I had paid a fraction of the price but after reading all the other reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  The reception staff were all very friendly and addressed all of my concerns.  The first treatment I had, the nurse was very careful and kept the light intensity low to make sure I wouldn’t have any scarring.  I had no downtime, minimal pain, and was very happy with the results of the first treatment.  At my second treatment, they increased the intensity after seeing that my skin can handle it.  The pain was still pretty minimal and the nurse was also very good.  I am very happy with the results and will be going back for other treatments.</review>

I couldn’t be happier with my experience at Alliance Health - the team here are welcoming, highly trained and offer several med spa options to figure out what is best for YOU!  They’re also WAY better on pricing and packages then any place I’ve gone.  The waiting area is not Lux, but instead they’ve invested in a well trained staff and the best technology, so you really receive what you pay for.   I’ve received Ultherapy, Botox, Coolsculpting, and fat cavitation services and all have been excellent. I highly recommend this med spa and fabulous team of people.</Review>

I had a great experience with Dr. Ramin and Romina today. both of them were quite sweet and kind. I'd say the best facility in regards to the treatment process overall, although I am just reviewing post VI Peel precision plus application (I've had two VI Peels prior to this) I can conclude that Romina was quite thorough with the post peel application explanation (which can be quite tricky as I remember from last time) and I was treated promptly and with consideration and respect. i was very happy with the office this far, and I'm looking forward to providing the results. I'd definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a peel procedure.</Review>

<Review>When you choose this flower shop, you can rest assured that you will be in good hands. Their flowers are all imported and brand new. They have the best floral bouquet arrangement of all their competitors at a very low price. They delivered it the next day, and it arrived on time. Before he arrived at that very impressive venue, the delivery called you. It is strongly suggested!</Review>< Rating>

Easy ordering online.  Timely delivery and they send you confirmation of delivery so there is no guessing if your flowers were delivered or not.  Gorgeous arrangements, even more beautiful than pictured. The recipient of my order couldn't get over how beautiful the flowers were. I'm a very satisfied customer and I will happily order again from French Florist.<//Review>

I always have the excitement to prepare a surprise for my loved ones because of this beautiful flower store. They could offer same-day flower delivery all over the place. Your flower bouquet will be arranged by their expert florist and delivered by their delivery men. They could promise that you can receive fresh and lovely flowers just like what they did to me as always.</text>

<text>Let me say a few words about The French Florist in Los Angeles and Terri, the head miracle worker over there. Searching for a good florist who could deliver to Sherman Oaks wasn't hard. Finding a spectacular arrangement to celebrate our close friends and a big family event was. The French Florist came through BIG TIME. We were extremely impressed with every aspect of the transaction and thus I want everyone to know how much Terri and the whole operation was appreciated. Don't miss an opportunity to use them. We shipped the Explosion of Color arrangement (see below) and it was a huge HIT. Thanks!!!</text>< Pictures>

I went to order some tulips and roses from this store. The price was nice because it was so pocket-friendly. I was so pleased that your florist helped me select the flowers. I thanked her for supplying me with some ideas on how to attractively organize it. Big thanks to you all! The best are you! Highly advised!<//text>

They were delivered on time and were gorgeous but the main signature flower of the arrangement was Stargazer Lilies which were closed.  They never opened up, the water became cloudy after a day, I refreshed the water but it didn't help, and the flowers were all still closed and dead within 2 days...I wrote their customer service 3 times and spoke to someone on the phone who said what happened wasn't right and she'd talk to the owner and make things right but nothing has happened!  They're expensive but apparently don't  stand behind their flowers...< /Text>< Pictures>

Thanks for the job well done! My partner enjoyed the flowers very much and, last Monday afternoon, I was very pleased with your warm and friendly delivery. Many thanks for the excellent work you have done. The florist was also very imaginative when it came to flower arranging. Guys, you've got to be on top of the list! A perfect suggestion!< /Text>

I have no doubts about purchasing it as a happy consumer. In the end, I didn't regret it because the pets I bought were so sweet and friendly. This is a well-known institution for dogs! I purchased a pet from this store on Monday afternoon. One of my favorite coworkers is the one who insists on having their pet treated with care and kindness at all times.<//text>

The best shop in the town! The flowers were well-arranged, smells great, and fresh. Besides, their shop was clean, comfortable, and tidy to look at. I mean, it was worth it to visit and to buy flowers in this shop. Also, the florist that arranged the bouquet that I bought was talented and smiling, and I like her personality a lot. I had an amazing time!<//Text>

<Review>Last week, I had a remarkable experience with this flower shop. I ordered online and I am very happy because the process is so fast and hassle-free. The staff I interacted with are very informative and knowledgeable, They have same-day and fast service which I appreciated so much. The arrangement of flowers also is very exceptional. Highly recommended!</Review>< rating>

They also use a high quality wrapping and a ribbon. The fabrics are gorgeous and robust. They use special packaging for their flower bouquet to ensure the consistency of the delivery. The package is sealed with a plastic wrapping to preserve the elegance and scent of each flower, much like what I got for my mother.</Text>

Yesterday, I went to this flower shop. I sound like I'm in a flower-filled garden. I questioned one of your employees, and she was really nice and expert. When she supported me, I was so pleased. I liked the architecture of this flower store. It was so beautiful and trendy. I'm sure I'll visit your store again. Oh, thank you.<//Review>

This flower shop is very successful when it comes to materials. It was a lot of fun to put it together, and the costs aren't that high. It was, without a doubt, the most exquisite bouquet of roses, and I'm confident my best friend would have adored them. I humbly thank you, guys! Keep up the fantastic work!< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>When I received doctors report that my Mom was terminally ill, I cried out loud and the peace Lilly that had been in the family reacted. The next day the leaves drooped..Later half the plant died😟
It  was tall from years of growth and needed to be replaced. French Florist was very understanding and did all that they could to accommodate the size  plant I needed..When it didn't  work  out as I  expected that made it right to my satisfaction  and with me , customer care is everything..Will use them again and refer others to them as well😊</review>< gmap_id>

<review>I bought flowers for my mom for she is my first love and it's her birthday today. I loved my mom so much and I wanted to let her feel that she's special to me. I was very much thankful to a woman who helped me to create a beautiful bouquet. When I gave it to my mom, she was crying for she was surprised and she said that it looked so expensive. She didn't know that it was just cheaper than what she expected. Admirable service!< /review>< Pics>

I highly recommend The French Florist for the most elegant and beautiful floral arrangements. Each representative I've worked with there is professional, efficient, and made great suggestions if I needed to change up specific flowers in an arrangement. I also find their website easy to navigate and use.
Thank you French Florist, your beautiful flowers have brought joy to many.< /Text>

< review>
I was in the hospital due to an unexpected illness for almost two weeks. My mom sent me some flowers, that were absolutely beautiful but died within a couple of days. She called Terri a couple days later and told her about my situation, how long I was in the hospital, so on and so forth. Terri immediately offered to send another bouquet when I got home from the hospital with no hesitation.  The flowers came the day after I arrived and I was in awe. They were gorgeous and an even bigger bouquet than the one my mom had originally purchased. Big shout outs to Ben the designer! I couldn't of asked for a more beautiful arrangement! Both Terri and Ben made such a horrible situation so full of light and happiness. I definitely recommend this shop. Not only for their flowers but for their customer service and compassion. Couldn't be happier!!< /review>

Gorgeous flower store! All my orders were shipped on time when I already needed them. For me, it was a fun experience for the first time. By chance, I discovered this unbelievable place and I am very pleased that they were able to fix everything perfectly as planned. It's worth paying for! For anything, thank you. Higher!

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Amazing Experience !! If i could give more than 5 stars I would. I needed to send flowers and the flower arrangements on standard delivery sites just didn’t seem that great, I needed to make an impression . I came across French Florist and was blown away by their flowers. I placed an order and the flowers were delivered quickly and were absolutely gorgeous! Because of their great customer service and beautiful flowers they gained a new customer, I wont be ordering from anyone else!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>I used to work here occasionally for the busy floral holidays and the staff was always friendly and professional.
I came back as a customer when I was getting married in 2018 because I wanted to make sure that my flowers would be beautiful and fresh for our special day.
So I ordered a bouquet and a boutonniere and they came out so beautiful.
I'm so happy that they made my special day complete.

I have ordered from you folks for over a year and so so disappointed   Order a top of the line and you sent below level and compared to the photos.  I even usually get text or email on your delivery and got nothing. Called your office and your person Gail left me on hold 15 mins. I hung up.  I won’t order from you again. So so disappointed.</Text>

I was amazed that this flower shop was able to quickly place my orders, and they even made it look simple. I can see that with her work, their florist is very amazing because she managed to coordinate the flowers I ordered remarkably. A beautiful show of service indeed! Many thanks, boys!</review>

I called French Florist because of their location and google rating, and I couldn't be more pleased. She offered simple, sound advice and found an arrangement in my price range. The product that arrived less than an hour later far exceeded my expectations and made my recipient very happy! I couldn't recommend this florist more.< /Text>

<text>Impressive! Flower arrangements look even better in person than in the photos. Delivery went off without a hitch and arrived on the day requested, earlier than I expected (glad for that!) I sent these flowers as a birthday surprise and the recipient was overjoyed, and has been excitedly sending photos as flowers open. Everyone keeps complimenting them. What a treat!</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBJ7EO6oxwGAStbYWuXg1KeC_XJtcdIKWCUue0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb0wdzP6UL3qUOsvHmZfHnsvVL0DgT2_Bsa7sy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

They love receiving flowers and we're always happy to send them when we can't be there with them for special occasions. That's when French Florist steps in and delivers flower arrangements that are absolutely stunning. We always know that whatever we pick from their website, it's going to delight them. Their website is also fantastic for ordering online, and even when I order at the last minute, they come through spectacularly.

<Text>Very disappointed.  I asked for May 25th delivery, they didnt get there until after 5pm.  I requested for redelivery the next day.  It is now 1:30pm and still no delivery.  I called the shop, been on hold for more than 10mins and the customer service cant even help me.  She can't track the driver to get exact ETA.  Her words:  "it will be delivered today.  If not, we will redeliver tomorrow".  Not acceptable!  Your customer service is absolutely disappointing!<//Text><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>

After having a miscommunication - Terry and her team were able to pull off something unimaginable and very tricky to do. The Designer Teresa did for me something so beyond and I am so grateful to them both. Beautiful arrangement and amazing customer service. Look forward to using them again.< /text>

I called up the store and they offered to deliver the flowers to a more convenient address for me and even gave chocolates. I was hoping to get it before I left the office and I was glad that the delivery man was calling me that he's on its way after an hour. That's the ideal customer service!< /text>

A friend sent me a surprise arrangement on a hard day. Delivery was prompt, the flowers were fresh, beautifully selected, elegantly arranged, pure luxury. Loved them so much I sent an arrangement to another friend who had her own rough day.
It was different from mine but same high quality experience. Customer service is excellent (though the wait on the phone is long). Internet ordering works great and if you mess up the address, they’ll call you! Highly recommend this local flower artist.< /text>

Today I ordered a floral custom made arrangement for my mom to be delivered to her home same day delivery, mom was finally leaving the ICU due to Covid complications, I wanted mom to come home to flowers to make her feel at home and to have a reminder that me and my girls were thinking of her every day and wishing her a speedy recovery, Terry and Michelle were outstanding! They went above and beyond ,they both showed true hospitality! They helped me pick out an assortment of fresh high end beautiful flowers, they suggested to add an assortment of teas for mom to enjoy during her recovery, as a manger of a local Texas florist and floral designer  myself, I was very pleased with the design skill and effort that was put on mom's floral arrangement... she was very happy with her flowers and that is something that is simply priceless, thank you for making it easy for me to have surprised mom and made her day. specially during this tough time... thank you for your compassion while taking my order. I truly appreciate it.</review>

< Review>
This East Coast guy found he was enamored with a West Coast gal, so he ordered a nice arrangement from an unnamed florist in the LA neighborhood. However, big bummer, the order bombed out. So he did some checking and a third party friend recommended French Florist; so this East Coast guy tried again. Working with customer service rep Terri, (who is an exceptional human being and customer service rep) they developed an appropriate concept fitting for a West Coast gal and his feelings for her. Upon delivery West Coast gal informed East Coast guy the flowers were a smashing success. Furthermore, the arrangment  made it through a few days without showing signs of dying. Soooo, East Coast guy just ordered a Valentine's Day bouquet of pink roses for West Coast gal!< /Review>

I reached out to this flower shop for a bouquet of flowers for my mother. The lady I was able to spoke via phone is very insightful and thoroughly explained everything to me. It was a smooth transaction and they have great value for money. The flower selection was absolutely perfect. My mother was absolutely delighted with the flowers and how they were presented.

<review>Great prices and friendly customer service. They were quick to accommodate my last minute need. It was my sister's birthday and I didn't want just a plain arrangement, I wanted something that looked like her. After a moment, the delivery boy called me before he arrived at my place, and I was very impressed and satisfied with the flower arrangement. It was all I really wanted. I highly recommend this flower shop to everyone.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Name>

New to California, first time I wanted a florist. Ordering online was easy and the product is great! Coordinating the delivery time a bit better would be my only thought. Bottom line, I got value of the cost and will use this florist again. Highly recommend.</review>

Then it occurred to me that a lush floral offering would be one item she would never buy for herself. I found French Florist on Google, and the comments on their website from clients were overwhelmingly favorable, particularly for the staff, whose caring attitude and exceptional eye for balance, color, and overall design in every arrangement they create, make each order seem as important to them as to the buyer. So I called and spent some time deciding on the details of my order with Terri, whose patient interaction with me over at least fifteen minutes proved that every word of praise I’d read was well deserved. By all means, if you want to give something luxurious yet entirely natural with the assistance of some talented and friendly floral artists, you couldn’t do better than give French Florist a call, and if Terri isn’t there for some reason, I‘m sure you’ll feel well taken care of by whomever answers. In these dire times, it’s essential to make room in our lives for something utterly beautiful and frivolous- it’s called feeding the soul! With the expert guidance of French Florist, you can make it happen.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

Their flowers are beautiful. I stopped in last minute and the lovely Mariana was able to make me a custom bouquet in under ten minutes at my desired price range.

<review>Today is me and my lady's anniversary and I almost forgot about it. I know what you're thinking. What a bad person I am. I know. Well, good for me that there's a florist who can deliver LAST MINUTE bouquets. And when I say last minute, I really mean it. The process was super quick and easy and I would highly recommend doing business with them. Maria, the person on the phone, was professional and knowledgeable about what the shop had to offer. She made it very easy for me while I was at work and kept me updated the whole way through the delivery. I can't wait to see what my lady's reaction will be when she texts me. Thanks again Maria and the whole shop staff.<//review></record>

Excellent service and such beautiful bouquets of flowers. They were able to deliver my flowers on very short notice. I was able to talk one of their staff named Ricky, and he took care of everything and even went out to take personal care of the hand-delivered flowers. That was a very smooth and hassle-free experience with this flower shop. Highly recommended!<//review>

My friend recieved the flowers, and the flowers were absolutely beautiful!! It made her so happy and she sent me a picture and I was very pleased.

I will definitely patronize you’re business again!</Text>< GmapID>

I came to this flower shop last weekend to order a bouquet for my mother. The flowers are beautiful, unique, and very high in quality. The service is amazing, and the staff is very friendly, helpful and sweet. The owner and other florists who work here are great, as well. I highly recommended this flower shop to everyone!< /Text>

I ordered the "Lovely Burst of Beautiful Blooms" arrangement for delivery to a friend convalescing at a local rehabilitation facility and she was absolutely delighted. Here is what she texted me: "Thank you so much for the beautiful flowers!! They have brightened my day and it's wonderful to have something so pretty to look at in the bland room." So, French Florist, thank YOU for creating something that cheered up my friend! I will definitely use you again.<//text>

Unfortunately, the flower arrangement was not like the photograph. It was droopy and looked a little old. Definitely not worth the 60+ I paid for these flowers. Really disappointed in what was delivered for my wife's birthday.< /text>

For more varieties of flowers to choose from that definitely will love by your loved ones, this shop has it all! This shop caters to all occasions like birthdays and anniversaries you had! Have their best and quality bouquet of flowers for deliveries, too. They were much cheaper than any other flower shop in the city! Thanks, guys!< /review>

I am a floral snob.  There, I said it.  Rarely am I impressed with the design or the quality of the flowers  I receive as a gift.  When I saw the beautiful, creative, unique arrangement my sister sent me, I was taken aback.  The design is stunning, the size of the white roses is impressive, and the wood square basket it is arranged in is exactly as it should be.  When I called my sister to thank her, she spoke at length of the AMAZING customer service she had.  Bryan worked with her patiently, answering every question and assuring her that her gift would be beautiful.  I called to thank them for the beautiful delivery, and Angela was friendly, appreciative, and a pure delight.  It is a rare yet wonderful combination to receive a quality product AND great customer service.  This is a florist that deserves to be patronized.<//review>

The cutest little flower shop you'll ever find! Super friendly and helpful service. I went to try to put together a unique little bouquet in remembrance of a friend, and was not disappointed. Great pricing- My gorgeous bouquet was only $14 and very unique. I love this place! I will definitely be back.</review>

Incredible bouquet created by Buckets for a friend's birthday! First of all - the ordering process was so easy (thanks to Michael!) and asked me a few questions about colors and preferences.. then he created this stunning bouquet.<//text>

As usual your flowers were beautiful and healthy - arranged magnificently. You really outdid yourselves this time - the flowers were for a special occasion and we were thrilled with the arrangement. So glad you're back open for business.< /review>

< Review>
French Florist came to the rescue. Early (1:00a.m.) on the day of our 54th Wedding Anniversary, it dawned on me that I had done nothing to commemorate the occasion. Flowers? But from where? Ahha! The Web.
I searched, many choices. French Florist stood out - a little pricey perhaps. I bit the bullet and ordered for a delivery prior to 1:00p.m.on the same day. Delivery came 30 minutes before the requested time. THANKS! Perfect arrangement. Better than web photo. Wife happy - wants a divorce to marry the French Florist!<//Review>

<Review>I love this place. I have been using them for over 12 years and every arrangement is perfection.  We had one delivery hiccup years ago (not French Florist's fault) but that's all. Everything else has been PERFECT! My most recent order was a gift for my friend's birthday. It really brightened her day! Thank you, French Florist!</Review><Date>1591204385504</Date><name>Elaine Ghobrial</name></record></dataset><record>

This is my favorite flower shop in the Bay Area, hell even in the country! The shop itself is quaint, down to earth, and just right. The people who work there are talented and excellent at giving you what you want. Their taste can't be beat and the prices are SO good. Everyone who works there also happens to be beautiful ! It must be spending all day with the flowers :)<//text>

I needed to say "thank you" to a dear friend for a precious kindness she afforded us. The arrangement I chose was even more beautiful and dramatic and artistic than the picture from which I chose. Thank you to the artist  who designed this for my friend, Dr. Kault.<//text>

<review>Excellent same day delivery! Was a little worried the address I provided wasn't going to work when they called and said they couldn't access the business address and as I did not have a backup address for the delivery, I would have had to cancel, but the driver circled the block looking for someone inside the the closed business to deliver to and succeeded. They really do their best to make sure the delivery happens, plus the photos my friend sent me of the flowers they received were immaculate. Didn't have any experience with flower delivery ordering before this but this transaction was so smooth and easy. Thanks again!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

After a Valentine’s Day Massacre (the flowers never showed up and I’m still working on a full refund 11 days later) with a national florist who shall remain unnamed, I decided to buy roses for my wife from a local flower shop. The flowers from French Flowers arrived when they said they would, were incredibly fresh and frankly just beautiful. I know where I’m buying flowers in the fuitre and it’s from French Flowers<//review>

I've ordered everything from corsages to large floral arrangements for parties to "in loving memory" arrangements. Their ability to impeccably translate a non-floral designer's vision into instant beauty perfect for occasion, space and occasion is astounding.

I will alway go to French Florist.< /review>

Ordered a same day delivery bouquet for my daughter's birthday and it was delivered within hours!  The woman I spoke to was very nice and assured me that they would be beautiful.  The bouquet was amazing!  So beautiful!  The flowers they used were so fresh, they lasted weeks.  I highly recommend using French Florist!</text>

Highly recommended. I ordered (kind of last minute) seven bouquets for the Moms on my staff on Mother's Day and what we received was better than I expected and at a great price too. Everyone loved their flowers.< /review>

I appreciate the variety of exotic flower arrangements French Florist has to offer.  The Thai orchids are amazingly tropical and placed together magically in a stylish vase.

Make someone or yourself smile with haute arrangements for any occasion.

I would use them for holidays at the office as well as special events.

Thank You for the wonderful arrangements!</text>

I ordered flowers for my Mom's birthday, and the arrangement was simply beautiful!  I could tell the florist put a lot of care, thought, and love into the arrangement, and it touched my heart truly.  This was my first time ordering with French Florist, and the reviews speak for themselves.  I also left delivery instructions for the driver, which were followed to a tee.  It was much appreciated.  Thanks French Florist for making an important day even more special!< /text>

I received the most beautiful arrangement from a Friend about a year ago. It was so stunning I called that friend a year later to be reminded where they were from. I was excited to learn after placing a BEAUTIFUL orchid order, that they could be delivered same day! (Having to wait several days for an order To be delivered is a pet peeve of mine) That evening I got a call from the recipient that they were the most beautiful flowers he had ever received. I will be adding French Florist to my contacts and using them as my go-to from now on!<//review>

I ordered some orchids to be delivered to a friend for her birthday.  She sent me a picture right after she received them. They were beautiful! More beautiful than the picture online (which is extremely rare). Quick and easy ordering process. Reasonable prices. And most importantly the quality of the flowers was better than I expected.  I will definitely order from French Florist again! So glad I discovered this place. :)<//Text>

French Florist is always on time with beautiful arrangements. We have a strict $$ limit and they are always working with us to meet our limit with the best arrangements possible. We had an issue last year where the arrangements were not as fresh as usual and they immediately uber'd new arrangements! Awesome group to work with. Thanks!!  USC</Text>

The ordering process was easy, and the recipient LOVED the flowers.  She sent me a picture and the arrangement was even more beautiful than the picture.  I sent flowers to say thank you to a friend, and your work spoke volumes.  I heartily recommend French Florist!<//Review>

I walk in and find hundreds of awesome arraignments. In less than 5 minutes I picked up a custom designed tower of roses and my wife was totally stunned by how gorgeous it was.  If you really want to impress than this is the flower store you need to come to.  I have been coming here for years and I'm always happy with what I find.  They have very helpful staff, and it seems like they are artisans all.  They really make me look good!</review>

They did a fantastic flower arrangement for me, beautiful and slightly exotic looking, exactly what I was looking for! Flowers were very appreciated by the birthday girl and delivered same day. Thank you so much, I will order many times again.< /Text>

I fell in love!! Heard of this cute floral shop from the famous blogger Stephanie Danielle, so of course I had to check it out for myself. I can't believe how much cuter this place is in person. Perfect for picking up your weekly blooms or upcoming events you might have. Definitely recommend them!<//Review>

This place gets it! I live on the opposite end of the state but I have a very special friend in the Los Angeles area. Initially trying to find a place to deliver same day and running out of hours to get my order in, I found their site and was very pleased with the ease and quickness. From there it was easy to go back the next time and the next time. The points program is a nice touch to help with those who order regularly. For Valentines Day this year, I had a rather different idea and even though I used the site to place my order(s) I felt like I should call to explain to someone what I was up to. That's when a very sweet and friendly darling named Carolina got on the phone and took it upon herself to handle my needs personally so they were to be done to my specific request. I have been blown away by her communication and the extra little things she has done to help me show this very special person how much she really matters. Very thankful for this place and I have no intention on using anyone else as long as I have a need for such services in the SoCal area. They get it done!<//review>

The shops behind the vendors are open as well, so if you're tired and want a coffee or bagel, make your way behind the vendors and enjoy the cafe's. Overall, this is a market that I will be returning to many times.<//review>

I have used Urban flowers several times now for funeral flower arrangements and have been blown away with the quality and unique pieces he personally builds. He's also very accommodation with last minute requests, friendly and his prices very reasonable. I'm happy to have found a new florist to meet any of my floral needs.<//review>

I've ordered from French Florist a couple of times now.  The first time after I found them online and the order process was smooth, the delivery professional and the results fantastic.

For my second order I contacted them via email because I wanted something different.  The staff was helpful and yet again the delivery was professional and the results even more fantastic.  They made me feel like a real VIP< /Text>

French Florist has been my business florists for years now. The arrangements are always gorgeous displays of sheer artistry; I'm talking Martha Stewart circa '99 meets Caravaggio. The two founders, Benjamin and Emerson have created an amazing team, a lovely shop and you can feel the positive energy in every stem, bud and smile. Highly, highly recommended.< /text>

WHAT AN INCREDIBLE FLORIST!!!

I contacted this florist in hopes they could make a special day even better. I was organizing a 100th birthday celebration with little to no budget. I explained the situation and within 30 minutes received an email from Steve, the owner, informing me he would DONATE 100 roses as a gift to the birthday girl. She was so surprised and grateful for this generous gift. Steve, you have a heart of gold and are a blessing to those around you. Continue to spread your love and light!!!<//review>

<time>1539963499537</time><Text>They ruined this owner and broke my heart in the process.  There is a very kind, older lady on our Board who doesn't have any family and very few friends.  She went into the hospital to have Coronary Bypass surgery.  She was very discouraged, frightened and depressed so the Board decided to take it upon ourselves to cheer her up and realize how much she has to live for.  We started a get-well card campaign and I was to send her flowers.  I placed the order and asked for delivery for the day AFTER she got out of the cardiac care unit and into a regular room.  I sent an email to the French Florist the evening the flowers were supposed to be delivered asking them to CONFIRM the delivery was made.  The next day I received a nice email from the owner asking if I was pleased with the way they handled the delivery so I thought the delivery had been made.  Then 5 DAYS AFTER the flowers were SUPPOSED to be delivered I get a call from the French Florist rep telling me that the lady had checked out of the hospital yesterday so they couldn't do the delivery.  WTH?  You have GOT to be kidding me.  She said they called every day to the hospital and was told the lady was still in the cardiac care unit and could not have a flower delivery.  How about the email I sent 4 DAY ago asking about the delivery?  Huh?  How about contacting ME to let me know they day after the delivery was supposed to occur that you couldn't make the delivery?  Huh?  I spoke to the lady and she said she was out of the cardiac care unit the DAY before I had the flowers delivered and that she went home 2 DAYS LATER?  Hello?  This is intolerable customer service and totally UNACCEPTABLE!  I'm SO angry I can't even breathe!  I will NEVER use this place again!  Totally disgraceful and they should be utterly ashamed of themselves for breaking the heart of a lovely older lady!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

While French Florist is not the most affordable option around, their arrangements, attention to detail and overall presentation definitely make them the best choice. They pick the best flowers based on the season and make for a great gift.</text>

<review>I know they are great for floral deliveries, but they are terrible for walk-in customers. There are no flowers on display, so you can't pick out what you want. We were allowed to go into their big walk-in fridge where all the flowers are, but they were clearly doing us a favor, and only 2 of the 4 people in our party who neededto buy bouquets were allowed in. The flowers were beautiful, but really expensive: $60 for a dozen roses. I know they make beautiful arrangements, so if price isn't an issue and you don't want specific flowers, this would be a great place. But for a more typical florist experience of getting to pick your pen flowers and not spend a fortune, this place doesn't work.< /review>< pics>

Whether you're a resident Los Angelo or a visitor to the City of Angels, the French Florist should be your "go-to" place should you desire vibrant, custom designed floral arrangements that are second to none in the design genre.

The owner's, Steve and Angela, along with their talented troop of designers and ever multi-tasking diligent staff are always, or so it seems, going far and above the call to surpass the expectations of their expansive and ever growing clientele.

If you are new to the area or visiting and need to make a unique expression, thought or thank you to a special someone, the team at this long established shop will create the awe you want manifested.

Walk-in's are welcome, however free parking is limited and street slots are metered, so I'd suggest a combination of calling and Internet communication first.

Major credit cards accepted, along with regular and express delivery options are available.

<text>This is an update to my earlier review regarding French Florist.  The original order had been placed with a third party company called "From You Flowers".  Beware of that third party company because they are the ones that dropped the ball in terms of delivery date, and you won't get as much as you pay for by using the third party.  However, French Florist itself I'm very very pleased with.  I wrote to them regarding my issues and they went above and beyond to rectify the situation and sent me a beautiful upgraded bouquet that I cannot be more pleased with!  They responded quickly, they called me personally and before I was even able to return their call I received the replacement bouquet at my office.  I'm highly impressed with their customer service, and now that I see the true quality of their flowers I can definitely say I'm a fan.  I wish the order had been placed directly with this florist to begin with rather than through the third party.  Lesson learned!< /text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Horrible & Embarrassing!  Don not EVER waste your money here, this so called arrangement cost me $72.98.  I called this florist based on its reviews and I ordered a small arrangement of sunflowers and succulents.  This was for a friends birthday.  She was not having a good day and I was trying to cheer her up.  She received a blue themed arrangement with seashells on the bottom.  I guess it would be nice if you live at the ocean but it was horrible!  Also the card was written incorrectly and she didn't even understand what I was trying to convey to her and also she had to ask me if I was the one that sent it.</Review>

I was SO disappointed in the delivery of the flowers, candy and balloons to my daughters work! I wanted her to enjoy them all day. But they didn't arrive until an hour after the time i mentioned the business closed. Then, they called her to see if she was still going to be there, lessening the surprise. I'd even called at noon to check and they said the drivers were just picking up the next deliveries.  She got them at 6pm! Very disappointing.<//Review>

Received a dozen roses from here and was honestly shocked by what poor quality they were. I honestly can not belive that this florist is in business after receiving the arrangement I received.  The water was dirty and full of leaves.  The roses were lopsided and looked like a beginner arranged them.  They used a floral tape grid and it was sloppy and showing.  The arrangement arrived at my work and I wasn't even given a box so I had to drive home with them on my lap.  I am honestly just so disappointed in these roses.  I know that my friend probably paid a considerable amount for the arrangement and I could've received nicer flowers from the grocery store.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I waited yesterday, 4-22-2018, for the delivery of a gift basket that a friend had ordered on line for me.  It was a wait that lasted from 9:00 a.m. until 7:15 p.m.  When I called my friend at 5:30 or so to let her know that I was still waiting....she called me back and said that it showed the basket had been delivered.  I responded with "No, no basket - not at either the front or driveway gates,  not at the front door or kitchen door,  nowhere did anyone leave anything.  She called the company only to learn that it was common practice for the employee to write in "delivered" before closing up for the day.  Personally, I believe it is a stupid procedure for a company to practice as it fuels unnecessary frustration, anger and finally, bad reviews. When the basket finally arrived, I told the delivery service what had transpired between my friend and the company - and warned them that if they had any other deliveries left they might find some very grumpy people.  What a shame - as they were totally unaware that online orders did not have a phone number to contact driver, and that the receiver was stuck for an entire day waiting as they needed a signature for their service.  I  wouldn't recommend this florist to anyone for any reason.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Ordered through FTD site, paid for the expedited delivery, flowers showed up 6 hours later (4 hour guaranteed delivery).  Called the FTD site, they refunded the extra charge.  The flowers that arrived had only a few fully blossomed roses, the rest of the flowers in the arrangement were still fully closed up.  (I ordered the orange sorbet which was more like a vase full of green leaves)  They also failed to deliver to the building and had the recipient walk out to the street to get them (very classy).  Somehow after all that they managed to completely forget the medium size box of chocolates that were supposed to be included in the order.  To top it all off the flowers come with a little tag that says "101% satisfaction guaranteed."  - Very disappointed with the poor service and mediocre arrangement.</Review>< date>

<review>My son delivered flowers over this past Mother's Day weekend for this florist.  At the time he was told he would be paid the first Sunday in June which was already weeks in the future.  He was sent on deliveries to distant locations having to use his own car and gas.  He did not receive even one tip.  Payment should have arrived no later than June 4th or 5th.  As of June 18, he has not been paid, but has been jacked around by Anna who is supposed to be the daughter of the owner and is the manager of the Pico Blvd. store.  After several attempts via phone, my son went to the store to see if that would help in his getting paid.  Anna was uncooperative although she did acknowledge owing him money.  Nevertheless, he still has not received payment for the work performed while being lied to repeatedly.  These are not business owners who deserve your patronage.  They do not pay employees as agreed.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9681cbfa321:0x314716dffa15768f<//Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

Don't recommend this place AT ALL!! I ordered an arrangement online and what was delivered looked NOTHING like the arrangement that was on their website. The flowers weren't the same, the vase wasn't the same, and the size of the arrangement was definitely not the same. After seeing the super small size of the arrangement and flowers that were delivered and comparing it to what I thought I had ordered and paid for, I felt like I totally got ripped off!</Review>

I was in town for a graduation and no idea what to bring to the party. Steve gave us great ideas for a hostess gift and the design they sent was the hit of the party!</Text>

Steve at French Florist was very personable, and as the owner he offered my wife and I the most helpful of tips for flower combinations and bouquet for our upcoming vow-renewal ceremony. Our conversation was very enjoyable, and long story short - my wife & I loved the arrangement we had gotten from French Florist. This place is by far the best flower shop I have ever been to, and their flower delivery never fails, either! Unlike other flower shops; the last time I ordered (June 25th, 2013; my wife's birthday) They arrived at my house in Encino perfectly on time and just the way I thought they would be packaged. LA's best florist, hands down.< /review>

<Review>I ordered through FTD the first arrangement that arrived shocked me. I paid a lot of money for the flowers and it looked horrible so I called FTD and they had this florist send out new ones. The new ones were looked like they just clumped a bunch of flowers together and dumped it in the vase. Neither had anything to do with my ordered flowers.... Back to FTD... I will NEVER use this florest again. How disappointing! If I could I would give this florist a negitive -star< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b9681cbfa321:0x314716dffa15768f<//gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

<Review>What a great service oriented business.  From the phone callI I  made to them they knew who I was as their computer had me there even thoughit had been about 2 and a half years since I  used them.  They even had my son's informattion  where I sent the last f flowers.    Their inventory was better than the Santa Monica shop and they deliver in Santa Monica!   The sales lady was kind, enthusiastic and effecient.
Just a nice experience not to mentioned the arrangement  in the yellow duck looked great from the photo my son sent.  New Baby grandson.  The last one got the red wagon..<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

They close at 5 and I arrived at 4:30, yet they didn't let us in. They didn't even bother to come out to tell us they were closed, just refused by shaking their head. Won't be coming back.</Review>

THE WORST!  I paid for express delivery (before noon) and they did not deliver on time. 2 months later they call me and tell me they want their review changed because my review "hurt their feelings." Sorry, no.<//review>
