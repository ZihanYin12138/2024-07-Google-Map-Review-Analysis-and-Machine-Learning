Always fun to stop here. Tasting are free and the sommeliers are so friendly. The tasting room is nice and it's easy to park here too. The wine is also so well priced, and they have a large selection that is not found in stores, I stop here often to get those bottles.<//review>

This place is amazing and accommodating! Mary Jo is an absolute delight to chat with in the evenings while we were there the past 3 days. The atmosphere was sweet and the rooms were clean. Great breakfast, treats and wine were the best! We hope to stop in the next time we visit!</Text>

<review>I always stop here when I'm in the area. Why? I need to restock my sweet red. They said it's sold in the store but I've only found it once and they no longer carry it. #sadface

It is also one of the few places that have a free complimentary wine tasting. If you go fancy, they have the $5 list where you try the wines that are not sold in the store. I enjoy sutter home and their people are always nice.<//review>< Pics>

This was our 3rd winery of the day and by far the best. Just because it is a more economical bottle of wine does not mean it should be passed over. We were lucky enough to have Nathan take us through our tasting and he did not disappoint. His knowledge and love of his job showed through. Kudos to Sutter home and Nathan for such a great visit.<//review>

Sutter Home Winery was a favorite among our group. Upgrade to the $5 wine tasting, it is well worth the price. You'll taste limited reserve wines. When you buy a bottle of wine, which we bought several, the fee is applied to the purchase price. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and price of the wines.</Text>

From what I could tell, this wasn’t the vineyard though. That was in a different location somewhere in the valley.

The tasting menu is mainly sweeter wines. Starts off with White Zinfandel, then Zinfandel, San Giovese, Moscato, and a Port. Hosts are not very helpful, not much background or insight during the tour. I’d recommend skipping for a better experience elsewhere.<//Text>

Free tasting of the "regulars", or $5 for wines only available at the store.  Paul was great and we had fun talking with him.  Then we bought a few sampler packs and he said "with the sampler packs the tasting is free".  Yeah!< /Review>

<Review>I like that it's right to the point here - wine. No fluff as many other wineries in Napa.
Taste, buy then head out.
Free tasting for the lower priced bottle, $5 for a selected list of 5-6 wines including the white zinfandel that I really liked.

There is free tasting of balsamic vinegar and flavored mustard with bread/pretzels. Nice experience and no line/reservation required.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Probably one of the better tastings in napa- yes you can buy it at the grocery store, but that’s why they are so good! Consistency! The man pouring the wine was excellent. I had the reserve wines and my husband did the free tasting. And only $5 for the reserve tastings which was about 5-6 wines. The also have samples of mustards, oil and vinegar to taste which were all good. Tip-taste the port with the chocolate, it was awesome!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>They produce massive 10million bottles a year - 22million including the other labels they own. So you can see the scale there. Not an organic producer or anything, but their white Zinfandel is something unique, and Pinot Grigio is not bad either.  You can’t really find much Zinfandel - red nor white - in Europe, so it was nice to visit.< /Text><name>amy</name>< GmapID>

< Review>
I’m a truck driver delivering to this winery. I checked in at 5:30 pm, given a visitor badge and told I could stay until my 7 am appointment only to be kicked out of the property at 2 am by a guard following orders directly from Miguel Calderon (Operations Manager supposedly). There is nowhere to park a semi around here for miles. There was no pleading with these people. Never in my long history of trucking I encountered anything like this. It used to be my favorite wine but now I will let everyone know how heartless these people are. No offense to the Trinchero family. I’m sure knowing I had their product in my trailer they would have accommodated. Thanks Miguel Calderon for having me drive around until my appointment time while I could be resting...I will write a letter to the company as soon as I am able as well</Review>

<Name>Sophia Yuen< /Name><Time>1468305108383<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have to admit that I made fun of this place for setting cheap ass wine, and to my surprise, it was actually my favorite out of the 4 wineries that we went to that day. The tasting is super cheap or if you buy a bottle (which is super cheap as well), you get the tasting for free. Either way, you win. I like the wines here as they are sweeter and taste more like juice. I love sweet wines (mainly moscato) and this place totally supplied what I was looking for.

Overall, I will never call this "cheap ass wine" again. And even if it is, who cares? It's delicious!<//review>< pictures>

You complain an Austrian winegrower family that has been around for almost a hundred years because it has the same name? Who lives on the other side of the world? More American is not possible. If I had not heard of the lawsuit, I would not even know that your company exists. shame on you.<//Review>

<Review>I enjoyed my visit to one of California's biggest wineries ... no problems ... but the reason I am not giving Sutter Home a high rating is because the experience felt like it was mass-market and mainstream, as opposed to a boutique or off-the-beaten path kind of experience.  Sutter Home wines are so popular and commonplace that they are served on some airlines in tiny bottles.  I regard their wines as some of the early wines that made California wines famous, but in my experience, people don't buy Sutter Home wines much anymore, except perhaps for big institutional or corporate users.  But I gotta give Sutter Home credit for helping get this industry established and thriving in Napa Valley.  The tour group I was with was given a talk in the building, and then some tastings while standing in a gift shop, and we were invited to step outside (beautiful day) to lounge on the lawn and near the old Victorian house which is adjacent to the tasting room facility.  We did not see any of the other buildings or anything else on the property.  The tasting room building is right up against the busy highway, detracting from any sense of natural surroundings.  Everything was neat, professional, nice and normal ..... but special? ?< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We have enjoyed Sutter Home wines since the 80s. It's a nice experience, especially when you visit the grounds. The rose garden is beautiful and rose species's are identifed for visitors.<//Review>

Absolutely beautiful vineyards. Make sure to take time to stop and smell their roses in the garden. They are to die for!
To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Sutter Homes wines. However, the wines at the vineyard made me change my mind. They have ones there you normally won't find in public, and they are much tastier.<//review>

While staying in San Francisco, we took a tour of Sonoma Valley vineyards.  We had several wine tastings, from small vineyards to Sutter Home.  We were impressed with all the vineyards.  Sutter Home surprised us in that their wine was very good as compared to the smaller vineyards.  In the past, we thought lower cost meant lower quality and taste, but were pleasantly pleased with Sutter Home.< /review>

The staff and especially guide were very rude and short with myself and a few others in our nappa valley tour group. It was also disorganized as no one was told where to go or given any real information of worth outside of the family's backstory. After a short 10 or 15 minutes we were left by the guide without warning. Will not be visiting again< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Awesome experience for an international author n friends travelling here!  Moscato Sangria n Reserve White Zinfadel (only available at the winery) blew away their typical store stock. Reserve tasting free with purchase! Peter was amazing!  I went there not planning to spend $ (I'm not your typical wine drinker) but the wine tasting experience was THAT COOL that I bought lots of product!   They have a cool wine club to deliver the stuff I like back home on a subscription cuz some of the wines aren't in stores.  Peter was so knowledgeable and so much fun!
Bring all your friends! My chef fiance loved the wine pairings suggested by Peter.  The treats were excellent.  The girls were sweet. They had tasty things to buy and wine accessories that wpuld be an awesone addition to your home.  GO THERE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We have been here several times and it's a great experience. There's a free tasting for their cheap wines and a $5 tasting for the better wines including the Zinfandel port. Yesica was very helpful and kind. If you sign up for the wine club then wines and merchandise are 30% off which is a great deal. Sutter home includes many brands including Joel gott, menage a tois, seaglass, Newman's own, and many more. If you like sweet wine then Sutter home brand is perfect for you. There's no bubbly here. I recommend visiting the tasting room.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

BETWEEN THE REVIEWS w/ Rodney S

Q)  Rodney, while you were in Napa, did you experience any wine tastings?
A)  Yes, Rodney, I did!  On my tight schedule, I went to a Grand Pour wine tasting at the Westin Verasa Napa, with the following day a visit to Sutter Home Winery.

Q)  Were there appetizers to munch on?
A)  Rodney, Sutter Home had a sumptuous charcuterie spread to go along with their menagerie of wine, which included goat & sheep cheese, figs & apricots.

Q)  How were the wine tastings, Rodney?
A)  The wine kept flowing to the visitor's content.  So much so, a young woman threw up on the shuttle bus back to the hotel.  I'm not really a drinker, perhaps indulging a couple times a year, so I enjoyed the sweeter libations, like their sangria & sparkling prosecco.  I also had tastings of Sutter Home reserve wine, not sold in stores, such as their sangiovese.

Q)  What else did you do at Sutter Home Winery?
A)  After helping ourselves to charcuterie & glass after glass of wine, we were entertained by a private concert in the round.  Underneath a party canopy, we enjoyed the musical talents of Zach Heckendorf, Brendan James & Drake White.

A fun photobooth provided the poops & giggles

Q)  Rodney, do you recommend visiting Sutter Home Winery for a tasting?
A)  Absolutely, Rodney!  The staff were friendly & hospitable during the couple hours we spent at the winery.  The grounds were beautiful to meander about in & I found a greater appreciation for wine.  Although Sutter Home is considered an economy class wine, the Sutter Home Winery wine tasting was first class all the way.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The garden is pretty. But the wine tastes just like that. It has a strong smoke scent, but it wasn't my taste.

(Translated by Google) The Napa and Sonoma region is beautiful, surrounded by vineyards. I especially recommend it in spring, when the vegetation is at its most beautiful, and therefore the views. The most interesting is the route from San Francisco, along the way you can pass objects that inspired the Star Wars director. A trip from SF must take a full day without unnecessary rush so that you can enjoy the beautiful views longer and more ........

Region Napy i Sonomy jest piękny , dookoła winnice . Szczególnie polecam wiosną , wtedy roślinność jest najpiękniejsza ,a przez to i widoki. Najciekawsza jest trasa z San Francisco , po drodze można mijać obiekty , które zainspirowały reżysera Star Wars . Wycieczka z SF  obowiązkowo całodniowa bez zbędnego pośpiechu tak , aby dłużej nacieszyć się pięknymi widokami i nie tylko ........< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Let's forget about our valleys with our alley companies. Let's immerse ourselves in the young American tradition. Sonoma Valley. Good wine presented well in commercial environments, suitable for the coach of people who came down to buy a souvenir, not really a place that remembers the wine shop but the whole package is worth the visit, taste included.

(Original)
Dimentichiamoci le nostre vallate con le nostre aziende vicole. Immergiamoci nella giovane tradizione americana. Sonoma Valley. Buon vino presentato bene in ambienti commerciali, adatti per le pulmante di persone scese per comprare un souvenir, non proprio un abienta che ricorda l'enoteca ma tutto il pacchetto merita la visita, assaggio compreso.</Review>

Hadn't seen Dr. Dale since the pandemic started so I couldn't wait to get in there and boy do I feel better! Love the service and convenience of his location. He and his staff are amazing!</Review>

I have been doing some sort of martial art since '94 and have been to a few chiropractors in that time. I will say Dr. Dale is one of the best I've seen. Extremely thorough and definitely makes you feel like he has your healths best interest at heart.< /Review>

I think Dr. Dale is like a Yoda of chiropractic medicine. I have only been a few times, but I can tell you I'm a lifer. I feel like the whole experience so far has been wonderful. He is thorough and takes time to really look at what is going on with your spine and the nerves. He has a holistic approach and offers great tips to improve health overall. I will be making appointments for my kids and hubby as well. Thank you so much Dr. Dale.<//text>

I would recommend this Chiropractor. He really seem to have real concern for your well being. The staff was awesome. They were kind and respectful. The reception went out of her way to make sure I was able to find the place. I'm looking forward to going back. There was no pressure to sign up with them.< /Text>

<Review>Our whole family goes to Active Life. We love everything about it. Dr Dale and Dr. Erin are the best. They make you feel like family. What’s great about it is they treat each person based on their own needs. I’ve been going to chiropractors before but this is the first time I have felt real recovery.  Great place!< /Review><GmapID>0x80dcaa0eb35712d5:0x4dc70b51ff058b2b< /GmapID>< time>

My first experience here was awesome. The doctor was very informative of everything and made it very enjoyable. His approach is unique that he waits until diagnosis is complete (after first session) to do any adjusting. I really like it. We’re going to continue going back for ongoing treatment.</Review>

Very friendly and professional staff, I take my 5 year old for adjustments and with his sensory issues, being adjusted is not enjoyable for him, but Dr. Dale is very good at helping my son through it and I have the utmost appreciation for the services.< /text>

Dr. Dale was very knowledgable, kind and professional. He took the time to explain everything to me so I could fully understand the process. He gives recommendations and doesn’t force anything on you. He does anything he can to make you feel better. It’s nice to finally relax with no pain. Going into their office was a lot more comforting than expected.

Absolutely loved the pillow! Especially if you’re a side sleeper. It definitely helped with any aches or pains that I feel in the morning using any other pillow. Dr. Dale was also super welcoming & accommodating, answering any and all questions we had< /Review>

This place had excellent customer service.  We got three pillows. My youngest daughter tried it and said it was too hard for her.  My oldest didn't like the shape so I gave it to my spouse and she like it. I have been trying to use it.i move a lot ar night so the pillow seems too small for me.< /review>

They let you know right away that they had water, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate if you were thirsty. The office was very nice and very clean. The doctor is very nice and did not mind giving you a few minutes of one-on-one time and to see which issues you personally deal with for you to use their product and suggestions on how to do it. I was very impressed since I've never been to a chiropractic office before. I would definitely recommend friends and family.</review>< Pics>

if you are seeking chiropractic care in the inland empire i would recommend active life. i've been under the care of dr dale and dr erin and i have definately improved. i have been a patient there for the past year and have seen everyone get the same level of compassionate care. there is no need to be afraid of getting adjustments here, both doctors are very gentle and treat everyone from infants to elderly and pro athletes. alexis at the front desk has done a great job working with my schedule and getting me the days and times i need. the key to chiropractic care is consistency, keep your appointments and do what is asked of you by the dr.< /review>

< Review>
I admit that I came into Active Life Chiropractic to claim a free neck pillow because I have been sleeping poorly for the last six months or so. I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere I experienced in this office. It was very welcoming. I love the open floor plan. I just felt like home. I have had a chiropractor that I have visited for 25-30 years and I have never really felt this way at his office.  I am considering making a change.

Now for the neck pillow. I had described my lack of sleep as a full-time job because I toss and turn all night and dont get much quality sleep. I have had the pillow for about three nights now and I have only turned over once or twice in the night since using it which has allowed me to sleep more rest fully.  I have also used it as lumbar support for my lower back in bed and in my chair. I had bought an extra for that use. I can see that this pillow has improved the way I feel and will only get better as I find more ways to use it. Thanks.<//Review>

<Text>I was a little nervous trying a chiropractor out on my back and I’m glad I didn’t procrastinate long on the idea of going or not. When I first came here my back was hurting bad from work and life. Now 2 sessions in and my back and neck are very relaxed and feel great! I have only 1 more session to go and I should be good to go for a while.

I went in for the free pillow offer and expected a sales pitch for other services... NOT THE CASE. Dr. Dale was very professional and sincere, using his valuable time to explain the proper use of the pillow, exactly as he indicated in his offer. I would definitely use and recommend his service for any chiropractic care.< /Text>

I went here for a long time to fix a catastrophic back problem that I was sure would never be fixed. I still go less frequently than before to maintain the outstanding recovery that I’m 100% sure would not have happened if I went to a typical strip mall chiropractor. Receiving help from chiropractic work itself is inherently a slow a process, it takes patience and a real commitment to get better. It also takes the help of competent and compassionate professionals. For this I give active life five stars whole heartedly. They are not a typical, stale health center. To anyone perceptive to these things, the entire building’s atmosphere has a healing air to it.< /Text>

Wow!!! I already feel relief in my neck after just one day! And a few days later now I’m feeling good! I used to get headaches from my neck pain but since I’ve had the pillow I haven’t had the headaches!  Everyone was so friendly and great! And I do plan on going back! Cannot wait to see how my neck feels in a week! I love this pillow and will keep using it!< /text>

Things about this pillow as a beta tester that are PROS:
1) It is compact but does support the head and neck well
2) There are multiple angles that may be used so as it find a more "custom fit" based on whether you are a back or side sleeper
3) The inside material is quite comfortable, not too soft and not too hard.  It seems to be the right blend of both for support and comfort.

Things in my opinion that needing improvement as CONS:
1) If there was a handout that explains the best positions of using the pillow for various types of sleeping positions it would take a lot of the guesswork out of the appropriate positioning
2) A suitable pillowcase that doesn't restrict the movement would be amazing
3) Care and wash instructions to be included on the sheet
4) Possibly arrows or numbers on the side (on a tag) to denote the appropriate placement for positional sleeping so as to ensure the correct spinal alignment

This is a beta testing pillow so I can only imagine it would get even better by final production!  Thank you for the opportunity to test this out.< /Text>

I stopped in about 2 weeks ago & picked up my free neck pillow. I was skeptical at first but since trying it, I cant sleep with anything else! Its the perfect fit for my neck. Also, the staff at Active Life Chiro were wonderful. Very kind & seemed like they were actually interested in helping you to feel better.< /Review>

I visited Dr. Dale's office and found it to be clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and professional. Upon meeting Dr. Dale I was pleasantly surprised by his overall knowledge. I have a less common ailment and he not only knew about it but educated me in areas that I would not have even thought about concerning my condition. I was gifted a neck pillow that has all but replaced the other pillows on my bed. No matter the position I am in, it is very comfortable.  I am looking forward to going back for future appointments.<//Text>

The pillow was very cozy so there was an easy of comfort when going to sleep. It was versatile with every position I slept. I found my head position to be supported, not just while sleeping, but also while sitting in an upright position on the couch. I am glad I was able to take part in this testing. Good luck with your product going forward.< /Review>

The pillow is amazing. Though I have a lot of work on my back due to a car accident, I feel I sleep a bit better having that support under my neck instead squishing pillows to fit between neck and head.  It's for sure a must try.  Thank you</review>

After several months of not going because life gets busy, I was relieved to get an adjustment that I immediately felt relief from. Dr. Dale, Dr. Erin and their staff are always warm and accommodating!<//Text>

The staff are super understanding and kind. Our experience was very comfortable coming into the office. It was also very clean. We came in to review the neck pillows and are sleeping on them nightly so far it seems to take some pressure off for our headaches......good experience</Text>

My son has Asperger's. We had tried every type of therapy there was. Sure OT, ST, ETC, helped a tiny bit, but nothing stuck permanently. My son always seemed to revert back. God lead me to Active Life Chiropractic. What a Blessing! I've never seen miracles happen before my eyes like this before. My son has improved 70% and its permanent behavior, thought, speech, touch. The Doctors and Staff are beautiful, loving, kind human beings. Highly, highly recommended to any one with an autistic child. It's not a 100% cure all, no. It is the best therapy I have every found. It relieves my son from so much anxiety. He suffered so greatly before he started this therapy. This has reduced his anxiety immensely. Miraculous therapy, Doctors, practice, and staff. Please let anyone you know who has Autism, or a child suffering in self destructive behavior, Please, tell them about; Active Life Chiropractic.< /text>

Awesome place! Clean, professional and I really felt like the doctor listened to me instead of rushing me out the door like my other doctors do.

I’ve had back pain for 4 years and done everything under the sun except chiropractic. I’ve only done two sessions and healing takes time so I will update when at the end of my program!

So far though, I do notice some minor differences in my neck after just one adjustment. And I definitely feel like I have a deeper understanding of what is happening to my body because the doctor really took the time to explain my particular situation.

And they have free coffee and tea!

UPDATE: I’m about three months in and I don’t know what I’d do without my weekly adjustments. Not only do they provide immediate pain relief but I also genuinely believe my recent improvement is a direct result.</Review>

I was one of the lucky ones to receive the free pillow and I’m so glad I did. At first look the pillow doesn’t look like much and I thought it might be awkward to sleep with but it was actually very comfortable and I did sleep better and didn’t wake up feeling like my neck was strained and hurting as bad. Having scoliosis and fibromyalgia there isn’t a lot of relief so I’m so happy to have this awesome pillow now. The staff are also very friendly with a comfortable atmosphere.< /text>

<Review>The office and staff are so nice. As soon as you walk in you feel the calmness. I love the coffee/ tea area and I also love the kids area great for parents to take their kids.
I never knew that a pillow could be so Usually I use it when I’m breast-feeding and to take a nap with my baby. I also use it as a leg support. I think I might take this pillow on road trips as well because it’s so comfortable and so handy.< /Review><name>Magdalena Garcia<//name></record></dataset><record>

So, active life chiropractic is in the same building as my massage therapist. As a matter fact, she is a client of theirs. I’ve heard great things about them. This morning, I was able to stop by and get my neck pillow. Their office is clean, modern, and simple. The receptionist was very friendly and immediately signed me in. When Dr. Erin brought me back for my walk-through of how to use a pillow, she was wonderful. I explain to her why I was so excited about trying the pillow and in the course of our conversation, she mentioned that she would like to get to the root of why I get this chronic pain. all it took was 15 minutes for me to want to sign up for a consultation with her and potentially become a new patient. (she did not pressure me- this was not a caveat of receiving the pillow).

When I got home this afternoon I happen to have a headache and neck tension, which is a primary reason I was interested in the neck pillow. I get this type of tension pretty frequently. I actually had a moderately Bad migraine. I took my meds,  Laid  down with just a neck pillow under my neck in bed, and was able to get an hour and a half of excellent sleep. I was able to lay comfortably on my back and on my side and felt great cushion under my neck. it was literally just the right amount of support and nothing more. Dr. Erin also mentioned several other uses for the pillow beside using it under my neck (such as using it between your knees, placing it as a lower back support, etc) and I plan to try all of those things too. It was pure bliss and I cannot wait to use it when I go to sleep tonight.</review>

Literally the MOST COMFORTABLE pillow I have ever used. One night of sleeping with it has already helped relieve much of my neck pain. In fact, I’m using it right now! I was very happy to come home to it after a long day. Also, their office is beautiful.</Review>

I love this place because the adjustments are super gentle and it's easy to get an appointment. The wait times are very quick. Everyone is super pleasant. The focus is on the spine as a whole and how it connects to the whole body. I've never had anyone do serious cracking or apply large amounts of pressure like other chiropractors.< /text>

I've had an amazing experience at Active Life Chiropractic. Ive been coming here for two years and my body has never felt better. I injured my back about a year ago and I was in bed for two weeks. If it wouldn't have been for my consistency to take care of my back and Dr. Dale's team, my injury would have been a lot worse. My back is fully recovered and I was back to work and daily normal activities within two weeks. My colleague had a similar injury a few weeks later and he was in bed for 2 months. Bottom line: Super grateful to have Active Life Chiropractic in my corner. They truly have my back!!! ;-)< /review>

<text>I’ve had the BEST experience with Active Life Chiropractics. I was in a car accident 6 years ago shattering my right pelvis (acetabular) fracture and two low back infusion surgeries L5-S1 and through the years I’ve dealt with chronic pain through my whole body, continuous sciatica pain & sensitive skin. So after so many therapy visits & doctor visits etc, my lovely wife ended up helping me research what can help. I was desperate for relief.
Active Life Chiropractics appeared on screen & came into my life. We’re gladly proud to be a part of their family. Every visit makes a difference & helps me be more active & back to a real life. I also got my mom to come in for her back pain & sciatica pain and in two visits that sciatica was long gone. She states she feel better & enjoys going to her 3x a week visit. We’ve had our doubts but Active Life Change Our Life. I have about 2 months now & my mother has 4 weeks in & soon to be assisting our pregnant cousin. I would always recommend this relief to anyone. Price arrangements are amazing & affordable. Through payments also. Thank you Dr. Dale & Dr. Erin
I appreciate everything!< /text>< date>

From initial exam to ongoing treatment plan Dr. Dale and Dr. Erin are attentive, caring, thorough and both very professional and very friendly.  I go periodically unless I have an issue, in which case they get me in right away.  Moved around for work and have used half a dozen chiropractors,  but would rank them as tops.</review>

<text>Dr. Dale and his team are AWESOME! Hands down, they are the most accommodating chiropractic business I’ve been adjusted at, and always are able to get me in at a moments notice! Dr, Dale is kind, attentive, and intuitive in how he is able to adjust and re-align my back, neck, hips, and whatever else need attending to. Their prices are fair and reasonable, and the discounts they offer, particularly if one is able to pay up front, make this chiropractic team unbeatable!< /text>< pics>

Although I picked up the pillow and was eager to try it out, I wasn’t able to. I opened the package and I immediately saw it was from China!!! Considering what is going on in the world right now  I had to make the decision to throw it away. I was very disappointed but I’m taking extra precautions. When I picked up the pillow, the staff were very nice and Dr. Erin was very nice and thorough too.</Review>

We have felt very welcomed and cared for since the moment we walked in, and everyone is very kind and helpful. The office is well suited for children so my toddler enjoys playing before her appointment although we don’t really wait to be seen so her “playtime” is short. Dr. Andelkovic is tender and patient with my daughter, and he goes at her pace. That was a relief to her when she felt slow to warm up. I like that he talks through the process so not only are we both informed, she also has the space to have a voice if she felt like she had something to say. He is knowledgeable and shares it freely. We are happy to have found such a great place.<//text>

Dr. Dale and entire staff at Active Life are totally amazing!  After 40 years of construction and 35 years of racing motocross (and breaking too many bones) I was in bad shape.  He has me feeling great with no more back pain,  truly awesome. I'm so grateful.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry!</review>

If you have an issue and you have the patience to really see it through, than active life wellness center is where you need to start going. They have a true passion for healing and I’m proof of it. They fixed back problems of mine that I was sure were permanent. It wasn’t after three visits ok but little by little they performed a miracle on me, and now I continue to go to maintain. I don’t believe any other chiropractors around could have gotten m as far as they did and it’s because they care. So go! This is a place of not only knowledge but wisdom. 100% find a way to make this place work for you and you will be very happy you did.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I came to Dr. Dale about 2 years ago during a very difficult time after suffering from a severely painful disc herniation. I was a complex case with other confounding medical problems, and over the course of time I saw other chiropractors who felt they could no longer help me. Right from the start when I first met Dr. Dale, he was encouraging that he had a different kind of approach to correct the nervous system. He was willing to do an assessment and create a specific treatment plan. When I began treatments, I could tell immediately that he was in tune with my body as a unique patient and he approached the adjustments with sensitivity. My nervous system has its limits, and he has always been gentle and cautious. He is also extremely patient and considerate of my disabilities. Since coming here for chiropractic care, my upper shoulders and neck now feel more relaxed with less pain throughout the day, and I have had a significant reduction in headaches and their intensity. The office has always been accommodating on days when I didn’t have an appointment and called because I needed an urgent adjustment to relieve intense pressure from a breakthrough headache. They have always been able to get me on the schedule fairly quickly. There were times I walked in with the worst headaches I have ever experienced, and within minutes to an hour after the adjustments, had dramatic or complete relief! Dr. Dale has also been extremely supportive and communicative when I was going through hard times and needed to communicate to him about my other health care providers, or when I had questions. He has never been impatient with me and has remained consistently caring and concerned about my overall wellbeing. He has been a voice and an advocate for my recovery. When I walk into the office, the staff greet me with kindness and a smile every time. They are respectful, attentive, and extremely helpful which has helped me feel less isolated during difficult times. Never has anyone there treated me rudely. Based on my experience, I have recommended Active Life Chiropractic to many other people. I am confident that if anyone has any fears about being adjusted, that it will be a positive experience no matter the person’s age or special accommodations that might be needed.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>I would have liked to try out the new pillow. Unfortunately this chiropractic office emailed me three or four times in one day and texted me three times one time was three hours before my appointment another time was one hour before my appointment and a half an hour before my appointment they called me. I just don’t think the best way of doing business is hassling your customers. So I decided never mind I don’t want to try out a free pillow if I have to deal with this.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1584567180145, 'text': "Hi Joy, thanks for your initial interest in our pillow. We do run a very busy office and as you can probably imagine, running this pillow trial while keeping a steady flow of our existing patients takes a lot of work and organization.

Not only is Dr. Dale a great chiropractor but he listens to you like a friend and truly cares about your health and the health of your loved ones. He explains everything in depth but in a way that is easily understood, and there is never any pressure as to what kind of treatment you should have. Thank you Dr. Dale and the whole Active Life Chiropractic & The Wellness Loft family it is always a pleasure! God Bless!<//Text>

Dr Dale and the team completely helped me and my terrible neck and shoulder pain! I still cannot believe the difference in my posture, pain level, and overall quality of life! I regret not going to a chiropractor sooner in life. The front office staff were always super friendly and accommodating. I spent 2-3 days a week here for 5 months, and have zero complaints. I highly recommend—just don't forget to take your glasses off before laying down like I would always do!  Thank you Dr. Dale!</text>

<user>107686940293212204085</user><Review>I came to see Dr. Dale when I was just a few months pregnant on the recommendation of a friend. I had seen a Chiropractor before but this time my experience was so much different. Dr. Dale explained all the benefits of adjustments and Pregnancy and I left with a much better education and understanding about Chiropractic in general. After the birth of my baby girl I continued to see Dr. Dale for numbess in my hands and arms and for neck pain and general discomfort, I even referred my family members too. After continued care I have a lot of relief from these ailments and have an improved state of over all health. I now understand that Chiropractic is a way of life! In addition to my care I was lucky enough to be hired on as part of his staff and to this day(2 years later)I am ever more grateful that I have been part of this amazing community that is changing lives and making an impact on the well being of so many individuals. What a wonderful group of people who are genuinely concerned for the health of their patients and friends. I will forever recommend Dr. Dale, Dr. Palmer & Active Life Chiropractic to my community.< /Review></record>

My back was a tangled mess when I started seeing the folks at Active Life. I've been coming in once every two weeks for a few years now, and would recommend to anyone having back pain. Everyone at Active Life is friendly and accommodating.< /Text>

As a fellow Dr of Chiropractic, I often get adjusted by Dr. Dale, as he is truly elite in his craft.  While I have gotten adjusted by many chiropractors over the years, Dr. Dale is uniquely gifted in his adjusting skills.  He has a gentle, precise, scientifically-specific method of adjusting that is effective not only at getting rid of pain, but more importantly improving the function of the master control system of your body. (i.e. nervous system).  I'd highly recommend anyone with a spine and a pulse to go see him, and get your family checked by him as well!<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Dr. Dale at Active Life Chiropractic is amazing! My initial meeting with the doctor consisted of meeting him and what he does and going over my concerns and exactly why I wanted to start therapy with them. My main concern was neck pain and lower back pain, most likely brought on by stress and physical work at my workplace. The initial consultation also consisted of a thermal scan to check the activity of my spinal nerves, checking my balance, x-ray imaging to get a better look at what exactly my spine looked like and how Dr. Dale will approach my specific treatment.

Kayla and Susan, the receptionists, always greet every patient and prospective patient with a warm smile on their faces, and the clinic is always willing to work with your schedule to make sure that treatment is flexible according your schedule. They have some teas and coffee available while you wait, but most of the time I don't have time to get anything to drink because there is rarely a wait that long to get your adjustments.

One thing Dr. Dale hates are those videos nearly everyone is familiar with on YouTube of other chiropractors using towels to crack necks and other treatments. While he does occasionally, at least for me, use some of the scary neck-cracking techniques you can find on online videos, he also utilizes a drop-down table which can be more comfortable and gentle for patients. I'm very glad my friend referred me here and I'm sure you'll love coming here and receiving treatment as well.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<text>My family and I have been seeing Dr. Dale for the past 2 1/2 years. Since seeing Dr. Dale I am no longer suffering from migraines and daily headaches. I had sustained a back injury from a car accident many years ago that I tried to ignore. After going under Dr. Dale's care my back problems have subsided. While I was pregnant seeing Dr. Dale helped to decrease many of the aches and pains I had had with my previous pregnancy. My husband sleeps better. My older daughter runs, sleeps, and balances better. My infant daughter is healthy and happy.

I have recommended Dr. Dale and the Wellness Loft to numerous family and friends. Most remarkable is my dad who in the past six months has stopped wearing a back brace and stopped taking pain killers for his back and sciatic pain. My dad was not a believe in "granola" medicine but now finds himself recommending Dr. Dale to others.

The front desk staff is always pleasant and helpful. The masseuse, Elizabeth, is wonderful. The also offer a holistic doctor, nutritionist, and accupuncturist.

I would highly recommend Dr. Dale's services to anyone who is suffering from back pain, headaches, is pregnant, having balance problems, or any other malady.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>At 4 months old my daughter was diagnosed with severe plagiocephaly and our pediatrician reccomended an alterative treatment of chiropractic adjustments since it far less evasive and traumactic on the infant. He reccomended Dr. Dale since he is known for his cranial work and excelent with children. I knew nothing of chiropractics at the time and everyone I knew was more than skepticle. Within a month my daughters head looked dramatically different. By the age of 2 she was completely better. She never had to go through the pains and trauma of a helmet because of Dr. Dale. His reputation has fast spread as an excelent and knowlegdable chiro. My husband and I are so grateful for him and his staff for helping our family. I have to also mention the beautiful and wonderful Lara in the comment, she will make you feel right at home in the office. A wonderful group of people I am so glad to have met.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dcaa0eb35712d5:0x4dc70b51ff058b2b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Always listens to my concerns and gives me great useful tips I can apply at home to better my well-being. Highly recommend!<//Text>

I was dealing with a lot of lower back pain and nothing was working. So I finally decided to go to a chiropractor and happen to stumble across  Dr. Bonilla & I’m so grateful I did. Not only did he help me get my back right but also shared so much knowledge with me so I can understand my body better.  I would highly recommend this place. Don’t keep procrastinating & make your appointment now!!</text>

He is my all time favorite Chiropractor. The combination of his warm fun loving personality and his high skill level of technical expertise make it a fun and healing visit every time. Because of my budget I can only go when I’m feeling in pain and my self care is not enough to bring about the recovery I’m seeking. Dr. Gloin’s skill always does the trick and brings the release needed for healing and realignment to come back to my body. I like that his adjustments are not timid, and that he communicates along the way so that I can inhale and exhale in coordination with the adjustment to receive the most amount of benefit from our time spent together. My favorite adjustment is in my mid back area. I haven’t found many others who adjust all along the back including the mid back area, as well as the neck liked Dr. Gloin does.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>I have had three appointments with Dr Allen Bonilla to-date, and I’m excited about the overall positive results. I’ve seen many chiropractors over the years for various injuries with little improvement, but not so with Dr Bonilla. He adjusts areas of my whole body which now allows me to stand for greater lengths of time with no low back pain. The pain in my feet have lessened tremendously, and I feel more well-rooted with better balance.  So far so great - I’ll update this review after several more appointments.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate><resp>{'time': 1623799924320, 'text': 'So happy to hear!

From just stumbling upon this business from an online google search, I have been so impressed!! Dr. Gloin is so awesome! Super personable, caring, kind, always on time, and genuinely wants his patients to feel better permanently. Location is always clean and diligent at abiding by pandemic rules, all staff are super duper friendly and kind as well! Gustavo has magic hands and give the best therapeutic massage and really knows how to feel out and target the areas you need! Overall very happy to have found this place and so is my back/neck!<//Text>

As a collegiate level gymnast, Live Well has helped my body recover and heal to perform to it's best abilities. Dr. Gloin is an amazing chiropractor, he is so sweet and works like magic! I've had Gustavo and Cristi for massage therapy. They are both great, I love Cristi's massages as they are trauma-point focused for me and also relaxing but Gustavo does a deeper tissue massage if that is what you are looking for. 10/10 recommend!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

For about a year, I had experienced increasing stiffness in my neck. A friend recommended LiveWell and Dr. Bonilla to me. I had never had a chiropractic adjustment before and didn't know what to expect. I was blown away by Dr. Bonilla's expertise, and the adjustments he made gave me relief instantaneously. I felt much lighter and had better range of movement. Totally recommend.</review>

<Text>Where do I begin? Chiro Health is truly an exceptional practice, from the amazing Dr. Maz to the great results you see and feel in your body. When you think of a chiropractic visit you think it's just cracking bones but not here, they work the muscles to really get everything loose before the adjustments and sometimes even use those cool electrodes to help with the super tight knots and so you don't feel so sore afterward.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1605030129020, 'text': 'Hello.

Working in veterinary medicine puts strain on your body over time and recently I was debilitated by my lower back pain for over a month, which ended up being a bulging disc. Live Well is not in network for my insurance but I will continue to come back as Dr. Gloin was very informative and gentle. I had much anxiety for my first adjustment and he explained everything thoroughly and I now understand my back injury a lot better and am working to taper off of muscle relaxers and large doses of ibuprofen. He used a tens machine and then adjusted my hips and back which made me sore but I am already experiencing an increase in my range of movement. They also let my husband come in the room with me which is a big deal for someone with general anxiety ❤️<//Text>

<text>Just wanted to put in another positive review for Dr. Latza, who has miracle worker expertise. I started having back pains from sitting all the time in the office. While I have seen other chiropractors before, none of them really got to the heart of the issue, the combo of skeletal and muscles.< /text>< Pictures>

I have seen several chiropractors in my life and Dr. Mazgaloff is by far the best. She uses several techniques and is flexible to individual needs. She also completely understands how to provide care over time, and that maintenance is very important to continued health. I highly recommend this practice.< /Review>

I have been going to Chiro Health for the past 4 months and every experience has been great.  This has been a rough year for me in terms of back issues and each and every time I leave the office, I feel so much better.  The exercise recommendations and their approach to long term resolution shows me they truly care for their patients.<//Text>

I started going to Live Well Chiropractic and Pilates Center after a car accident I was in. The first month was really challenging as I was still in a good amount of pain. Dr. Mazgaloff is incredible and really helped me understand the process and what was going on with my back. Last month I got married and I felt 100% better for my wedding. So grateful for this place<//Review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Matthew Gloin for 7+ years. During that time, his care and expertise has and continues to relieve me of chronic lower back pain.I was referred to him by a friend and have never looked back. He has healed me through countless car accidents, Work related injury and  extracurricular activities that went awry. I cannot recommend him enough. His knowledge is extensive.His compassion and empathy are evident with every visit. His bedside manner is extraordinary. As someone who LITERALLY DROVE to his office Immediately after being hit by a car, crying hysterically , He made time to see me and calm me. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Gloin for all he does. He has a patient for life!</review>

I love high-intensity workouts and I had tried Pilates at Los Angeles and really enjoyed it. Recently I tried the Row N Tone class and I absolutely loved it. It was challenging and fun. The instructors are super helpful and focus a lot on form so you get a good burn and always feel like it was time well spent. I'm still sore but I can't wait to do it again. :)<//review>

The greatest chiropractic and Pilates studio EVER. Beautiful, clean and modern. From the minute you walk in, you will feel welcome - the front desk and kind and accommodating. Dr. Gloin (the owner)  is so caring ,professional and kind. He is constantly updating his expertise and the studio to be cutting edge.  The massage therapists are experts - they KNOW way more than your average garden variety massage person from a spa - they are experts in the WHOLE BODY TREATMENT and work with the chiropractors to make sure they are treating your issues. The Pilates classes are so much fun and are aimed at all levels - each instructor knows how to adapt classes to every level of client. You will get a workout as every class can be adapted TO YOU. I cannot say enough good things - I come here for all my back and muscle issues - it is such a beautifully integrated office - why go to 5 places when ONE can synchronize all your needs.< /review>

I have had chiropractic treatments throughout the years, but none resulted in the life changing healing that I have had with Dr. Bonilla.  Although I came in for neck injury after an accident, I mentioned that I had worn orthotic inserts in my shoes for years.  Over the course of about 4 treatments in a few weeks I noticed I could be barefoot comfortably standing on hard floors for the first time in more than a decade.  I have been able to put aside my shoe inserts, and can stand for hours with no pain or discomfort.  This has been an amazing shift for me, my total body pain is much less, and I have more energy.  I recommend Dr. Bonilla and all of the lovely people at Live Well to anyone who is living with pain and discomfort, it is an enormous difference in my health and vitality!< /review>

<Name>Tony Anderson</Name><resp>None< /resp><Text>LOVE this place. The team, the services offered and the overall vibe is astounding. Excellent customer service from the front desk, and Dr. Gloin is a boss - so locked in to exactly what I need and offers a holistic approach - he practices what he preaches. I visit frequently because I sit at a desk a lot during the week and my shoulder and back need consistent adjustments, so I also see Parker for a weekly massage and OH MY GOD he is the best. I've had dozens of massage therapists for my occupation and none of them compare to Parker. I hesitate to even mention him by name because I don't want his schedule to get so full I can't see him anymore!<//Text>< userid>

When I went into Live Well Chiropractic, I was miserable. I had pinched a nerve sleeping in a weird way on my couch and the pain was radiating down my left arm. Nothing I did(using ice, heat, roll on, creams) was helping. Yet, in the short time(less than one hour) I was with Dr. Gloin, I felt relief almost immediately! The pain in my arm subsided. The muscle in my back relaxed! I plan to become a regular customer/patient of Live Well Chiropractic and Pilates Center!< /review>

<review>Ive done a couple sessions of endonasal correction for my deviated septum with Dr. Bonilla so far so good Im seeing a difference. Dr Bonilla also did some adjustments on my neck and back to supplement the endonasal correction procedure. Great experience so far Im looking forward to continuing to seeing positive results with my follow up appointments.< /review>< date>

<text>I last reviewed Live Well three years ago -- and it is time to update again in 2020, especially now that the virus is spreading around the world.  Classes are still being held here -- and the most immaculate care is being taken of every piece of equipment, our own health, etc, so I am still going.  What a wonderful, friendly atmosphere!  All the teachers are highly skilled, pleasant, and very attentive -- this is not one of those mass classes where individual attention -- so vital in Pilates because of the subtlety required to do a movement correctly -- is scarce -- instead, every one of the teachers remains hyper aware of what each student is doing.  This is truly a "neighborhood" Pilates Center -- I'm so grateful it's here!<//text><Resp>{'time': 1584488925682, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind review.

I’ve been going to Dr. Gloin for almost a year now. He’s helped me recover from back pain that I thought I was going to gave for the rest of my life. More recently, he’s helped me stay healthy as I deal with the aches and pains of trying to stay physically fit in my 40s. I’ve found him to be both personable and highly effective.

The additional services available at the center are great complements. I’ve taken several Pilates classes focused on back health, and they’ve worked wonders.

The entire staff is friendly and easy to work with. Visiting Live Well is a welcome break in my day.< /review>

So glad I found this place! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Dr. Gloin is very warm and really listens. I really like that he takes a "whole body" approach and goes the extra mile in checking in with his patients. When you walk into Live Well you get a sense that people are truly happy to be there (albeit they're probably in some pain) I especially LOVED being greeted by Dr. Gloin and his dog (what a warm, friendly touch.) AND the place smells great! Always a plus in my book!< /Text>

I have being working as Pilates Instructor at Live-Well since 2016. I like to teach at the studio due to small group classes (5 people). It allows me to give enough attention to each client, provide appropriate modifications and variations as needed as well as keep track the progress for each student. Dr. Gloin created friendly atmosphere at the studio and build community of professionals who share his passion of promoting improved health and well being for studio's patients. I am proud to be a part of the Live-Well professional team.<//text>

Treatment was unfortunately not helpful considering the amount of time examining movement ability, which was extremely painful for me.
She was very nice and courteous, just not helpful for my pinched nerve. I would not recommend for my specific ailment. Perhaps suited for other chiropractic services.< /Text>

< Review>
I’ve been going to Live Well for years and my body is so much happier!  I have a real tendency towards tension and muscle tightness and for much of my life had lots of headaches and pain.  It used to feel out of my control, but not anymore. With a combination of high-quality chiropractic care and regular Pilates, my body just works now.  While I don’t need adjustments as often as I used to (thank you, Pilates!), I still see Dr. Gloin for tune-ups.  He is a great combination of skilled and kind.  He listens and cares how I am doing.  I trust him and feel really safe with him so it’s much easier to allow my spine to be adjusted.  I am very grateful to have someone that I can go to when I need help.

At LW the Pilates classes are so good! The instructors are so fun and welcoming – and even more important—knowledgeable!  They encourage me to push myself yet make thoughtful modifications when I need it.  Try the Back Fit class if you are just getting started or are recovering.  Yet with a maximum of 5 students, whatever class you go to they make it work for everyone.</Review>

I am so happy with both the chiropractic care and the Pilates courses that I take at Live Well.  I have been taking classes consistently for 3 months now, and I am so pleased with the changes in my body shape and the new strength I feel.

I recently had some lower back pain which I think was caused from spending too much time sitting at the computer.  Dr. Gloin is an excellent chiropractor and after just a few adjustments my body feels good again.

I love all of the Pilates instructors at Live Well, they each have such amazing, warm personalities and it's very enjoyable to spend time working out with them.</text>

The 12 hour notice for group classes is quite ridiculous. I have taken Barre classes all over Live Well Chiropractic and Pilates Center at many different locations and this is the only studio that has a lengthy amount of time for a cancellation notice. I can see 3-4 hours notice being reasonable, but how are you supposed to know if any emergency comes up or you are sick, half a day before the class? Seems to me they are trying to tack on as many fees possible!< /review>

I have been a regular at Pilates classes at Live Well for several years and the experience has been wonderful.  With classes of  maximum of 5, participants and instructors get to know each other well, personal attention is paid to each participant and progress is well tracked.  I usually feel exhilarated when I leave the class; more important perhaps, my posture, strength and flexibility have all improved considerably.  Dr Matt Gloin and his office staff are friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended!</review>

I have known Dr. Gloin for many years and he has never changed - he is truly a caring and kind doctor/chiropractor that truly listens to his patients and their needs. He offers many services to improve his client experience  of healing and continued good health. Offering a menu of Pilates/Massage and Acupuncture  show he truly believes in integrated care and prevention.
The fact he is available on Saturday should add ONE MORE STAR to this review.< /Review>

I'm kind of embarrassed that I haven't ever gotten around to writing a review for this doctor who's been so important to my continued good health. I've worked with Dr. Matthew Gloin for over a decade now, and I trust and respect his talent so much that I still come see him even though I moved 2,000 miles away. I've worked with chiropractors from coast to coast, and his thoughtful care is among the very best I've ever experienced. Plus he's just the best guy. I still get adjusted by him when I come back to visit, and I send all my Angeleno friends to Dr. Gloin. You're simply not going to find better spinal care. Thank you, Dr. Gloin!</review>

I’ve gone to many chiropractors over the years, as I suffer from chronic pain. Dr. Gloin is absolutely the best. I have experienced a great reduction of my pain, due to his treatment and valuable advice. The atmosphere is very zen and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Live Well also offers Pilates and massage. It’s wonderful when you finally find that one great doctor. Once you experience the professionalism, expertise and kindness of Dr Gloin, I guarantee your search will be over. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Love!
I started to take classes at this studio last year and after the first session I was hooked. I used a facebook coupon for a trial session! I have been to other Pilates studios and this is the place I come back to and now consider home.  The front office staff is friendly and sessions super easy to book.  Stephanie is my favorite instructor because her classes are challenging, friendly, motivating and best of all she remembers everyone's name.  Now that I think about it all instructors remember my name probably because I need correction at every session!

Parking is easy, free and always available.  I go in the evenings and always find parking on the side street or the back area parking lot.

I look forward to my sessions every week and at the end of each session I feel stronger and relaxed.  Thank you Live Well!< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2b9101db1f505:0x8805b4e630af34ab< /gmapID></record>

<review>I attend Pilates classes weekly at Live Well, and I absolutely love it.  It's an amazing workout, and it's so good for your body.  The techniques I've learned have helped keep me in shape after a surgery.  The instructors are incredibly knowledgeable, and they know how to work with injuries.  Dr. Gloin is also a fantastic chiropractor who goes above and beyond for his patients, and all the massage therapists are amazing as well. You can't go wrong at Live Well!</review><UserId.>103443386876988659338</UserId.>< gmap_id>

As a chiropractor I have behind-the-scenes knowledge of how most chiropractors operate. Having known and met Dr. Matthew Gloin personally I can vouch for his integrity and the true caring nature of him as a chiropractor. Additionally I am pleased to be able to work in the caring community of therapists and trainers he has brought together. Whether you come for chiropractic, pilates, massage or acupuncture you are guaranteed to be under the care of a knowledgeable and caring, ethical practitioner at Live Well.< /Text>

He tailored the treatment to my specific needs while being very informative throughout the whole experience. It is obvious that Dr. Bonilla is well educated and versed in his practice. I felt comfortable and in good hands. My body is already feeling like a body again! Highly recommend this center and Dr. Bonilla especially!<//text>

I have been seeing Dr. Gloin for about 6 years now. I came to him after a car accident and he did wonders for me. I made a full recovery thanks to his effort. He really impressed me because he actually cared about my health. I have been visiting Dr. Gloin ever since for general maintenance or whenever little nagging things pop up. He's a great Doctor and great guy and I can't recommend him highly enough.< /Review>

Dr. Gloin was amazing. I've had back pains and neck problems for weeks, until I came here for the chiropractic session. It was absolutely a relief to see a real chiropractor in Dr. Gloin that knew how to cure my back pain. The price for the whole session was not too much, but because of his honesty and expertise I don't mind coming back again. He's incredibly honest too, gave me a few pointers and self exercises to treat my back in case pain were to occur again. Very much recommended doctor.<//review>

I have been going to Live Well Chiropractic and Pilates Center for about 10 years and have always felt lucky to have this wonderful gem in my neighborhood. I have benefited from most of the services offered at Live Well -- from great chiropractic adjustments and deep tissue massage to pilates classes. Dr. Gloin who has been my main chiropractor, is very attentive and takes his time to make sure my needs are addressed and I always leave the office feeling much better. Deep tissue massage with Cristi is heaven on a table! I have tried various pilates classes there and find them to be very strengthening and toning. My daughter had private pilate sessions for a year at Live Well, which helped her build a lot of strength and flexibility in her body. The staff at Live Well are all very friendly and accommodating. They work out all the kinks with my insurance and that way I don't have to worry about that. I also love that they are open on Saturdays, which is very convenient, especially if I can't make time to go there during the week. Live Well also happens to be within a block or two from two of my favorite lunch spots -- Powerplant and Bloom.
I just can't say enough good things about them!< /Review>

Dr. Gloin has late business hours, which is great for those who work late and the office is open 6 days a week. The office is very accessible and there are plenty of parking spaces.

I have been seeing Dr. Gloin on and off for 5 years. Whenever my back pain gets bad enough, I drive 10 miles to see my favorite chiropractor. Dr. Gloin is very good at what he does. He makes me feel much better very quickly and does not mind explaining what he is doing every step of the way. We live in a city with a lot of great chiropractors but what sets Dr. Gloin apart is that he never once try to sell me a package or make me feel bad about  seeing him only when there is an emergency. There is never any selling or pressure.< /review>

Dr. Gloin changed my life. The side effects of a surgery had left me unable to do many of the things I love - like swimming, running, and even washing my car. I lived some years like that, but soon after starting weekly adjustments with Dr. Gloin, I've been able get back to those activities and more. I continue to visit him for regular upkeep.

I had a very sore back, so I decided to come here and see Dr. Gloin. Due to sleeping in the wrong position many times, my neck was in need of adjustment because I had a pinched nerve and it was quite painful. Dr. Gloin helped me set up an appointment to see him and I was able to attend a chiropractic session. After the session I felt great relief in my neck and back, and it was all thanks to Dr. Gloin. He's a brilliant chiropractor and I really want to come back again.</review>

Great food, especially the breakfast burritos. I love the food here, but had never tried the breakfast burritos until the other day. They are huge!! And filled with eggs, tons of bacon, cheese and has browns. And their in house salsa is 👌🏼. The owner, Bill, is a great guy who takes care of a lot of local schools. Great food at a good price</text>

This was one of our picks of food off the strip that we wanted to try. I am very happy did come here. The staff was very nice helping pick  from the menu, they even were ok with making a plan dog for my very picky 4 year old. With in our famy we tried a few different items. The dogs and corn hit the spot, I wish we had one one back home in Seattle.<//Review>

So bomb, and it's right down the street from my dad's house!

Had the ABC omelette (with apple sausage instead of bacon) and a side of home fries. Definitely recommend that with a freshly squeezed apple-cucumber juice!< /review>

We often frequent SideYard! My fave items are the Chinese Chicken salad and also the Salmon Tacos and salad! The burgers are awesome with some toppings specific to this restaurant! The breakfast burritos are delicious! Friendly staff, great service! The owner is often out mingling with guests! Highly recommend this little but mighty place!<//Text>

<Review>A lovely little cafe right off the freeway & biking distance from CSULB. Friendly staff and unique food: I have fallen in love with orange zest sausage! Have yet to try anything but breakfast but their food is so great I would imagine lunch & dinner are just as tasty, if not better. The cafe is pretty small but boasts a coffee bar with lattes, always a plus, and offers take out as well. Highly recommended!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>Talk about a GEM! I went to the SideYard Cafe today and asked the chef, Jesse, to cook me whatever his best burrito was. Holy smokes, he did not disappoint!!! The thing was MASSIVE and incredibly delicious! The ambiance there is rad, as well. Bri, was super pleasant too, great conversation, service, and funny as hell! I'll definitely be back!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Went here to pick up breakfast for my family.
Place was close to empty but people started filing in after i ordered, there were a couple groups of 4 and 5 ahead of me, but i waited over an hour for my food.  No idea what these other reviews are about, it was absolutely ridiculous.  Waitresses are nice, food was ok, but place is a joke, i watched them serve tables the wrong plates, then say nothing to the customers.  Go to fantastic burger or potholder if you're looking for better options.<//text></record>

<Review>First of all, where is the letter rating? Seems shady that they don't have one... Food was still good but it costed 50$ here for a family of 3, nothing extra ordered. Staff was friendly however:) Area was really crowded and made me somewhat claustrophobic. Menu has a good variety too< /Review>< rate>

Tuna in tuna sandwich was old.  I mentioned this to waitress.  Unexpectedly, she did not charge me for this.  My friend had French fries. They were so greasy she wiped them off with her napkin.  Disappointed.<//Review>

<text>When I walked into the restaurant the chef(Jesse) kindly walked up to me and very politely took my order he was one of the most  kindest person I have ever met he was very  enthusiastic and happy and deserves to be working at SideYard Café.  I took my food home I ate it and it was the most juicy flavorful and best burgers I’ve ever had I will be coming here until I die. Thank you Jesse for giving me an experience I will never forget. By the way can someone give him a raise he deserves it.

I got the umami cheeseburger and the amount of wasabi flakes gave the burger a great taste to it, and I don't usually like wasabi. My family got the Salmon burger with the raspberry glaze and the pastrami sandwich. The raspberry glaze wasn't my kind of taste, but my sister loved it. As for the pastrami sandwich on sourdough, it was perfectly cooked, and honestly I was jealous I didn't order it myself!</Review>

<text>Food is good. Latte only comes in vanilla or hazelnut (no caramel or mocha), but that's OK. Been here 3 times, and each time the English muffins were never crispy. Servers have always been "meh" about service. Owner is always friendly/social.</text>< UserId.>

First time there.  Had the Patty melt (yummm)and fries.  Filled me up big time.  Prices are reasonable and food is fresh and prepared with care.  Nice staff.  Can't wait to return and try other dishes.  One complaint...if your having wings, you get blue cheese not just ranch.</Text>

<review>Time to time you come to see small Restaurants like this one scamming people by writing small signs on the front window saying locally owned, while i was going to Taco bell next door i said to my self maybe locally owned restaurant maybe serving good food which was not the case, i ordered the pastrami sandwich which was horrible sandwiche, salty and smelly low quality pastrami, the lousy $12 sandwich made me sick within the first 2 hours of eating it, the Macaroni salad which come with the sandwich was just as bad, this a terrible place to eat inn, no owner on hand only couple of unprofessional employees running the place, i don't recommend it based on the above reasons, don't waste your money in this bad restaurant.<//review>< Date>

Well, I've only been here once & I ordered a salad with only 7 ingredients and they left 1 out :( It was still good but I love cranberries & ordered it for that. I will give them another try for breakfast next time.<//Review>

Incredible! I loved it so much. It's a perfect poke bowl. Service was friendly and fast, I was in and out in just a couple of minutes. I've eaten a LOT of poke and I was blown away by how good this place is. Please get out there and support your local businesses!!!!< /text>

<review>Fast service, friendly staff. I'm only giving 3 stars though because the shrimp wasn't properly cleaned. I was hoping it was just a one of, but most of the shrimp I received still had the "vein".<//review>< Rate>

Carney's is located on the Sunset Strip in a train car. Parking is easy and the service is fast and friendly.

Don't go with fancy here. They have great hot dogs and hamburgers. Stick with those items and you will be in heaven. They have a wonderful selection of hot dogs and will make you a burger anyway you want it.

You can dine in or take out. We love dinning in. Sometimes there is a wait, but it is not usually too bad. You will like this place. Super tourist and kid friendly. Have a great time.< /Review>

<Text>Really good! It’s hard to find poke places that serve tofu (in vegetarian) and this one just newly added tofu to their menu so I’m for sure going to be ordering here at least once a week probably.
Usually I have to go down to Orange to get it.
I Postmates’d it and ordered the sauces on the side so it wouldn’t get soggy and it was so good!
The portions are great, and the topping choices they offer pair really well with it.
Some topping they offer are pickled radishes (the yellow ones like in kimbap/sushi), pickled jalapeño, and crunchy onions!!!!!

They use a leafy green lettuce not iceberg so extra points for that!

Overall really satisfied with the flavor and options.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

Nice little hidden gem. Parking is at the side of the restaurant. Very nice owners and employees there. They keep themselves busy so expect to have to get their attention. Food is made to order and is worth the wait. Ordered the spicy rice cakes with cheese, bulgogi kimbap, blood sausage and the bulgogi rice bowl. Generous portions given along with side dishes. Order was to go, neatly packaged and secured. I live a distance from here but after trying their blood sausage, I will be back. Also, if you order to go, just know that you can ask for extra condiments (gochujang sauce, etc) at no charge.</review>

<Text>Yes.... This place is amazing. Just go in their and I promise you won't be disappointed unless your going to the one in orange mall because that one does not give that much food. Yorba Linda however, you will learn to love every employee their. Trust this place is a must when going for poke/raw fish.<//Text>< pictures>

Ordered through Postmates, and they are by far the worst Poke bowl I've ever had!!!  The jalapeños they used are pickled and throw the entire taste of the Poke off!!!  The sizes are exactly the same just addition protein choices. The only give you a very small amount of Wasabi that you can't even taste once added to you bowl.  Not to mention my Fiance and I have had nothing but stomach issues all night since about 45 min after eating!! NEVER AGAIN!! 🤮</review>

The food is pretty good. Make sure to avoid a lunch line. I've eaten there at least a dozen times and they've only messed up one order. Kind of pricey though. I probably don't want more often if it didn't cost two meals worth. So it's only a sometimes treat.</text>

This location has excellent service, and that's what keeps me coming back. I always enjoy a poke bowl, and this is just one of the places I frequent. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are generous, and they've got the right sauces to finish it all off (some bowls at other locations are too dry for my taste).<//text>

Best Poke place in Yorba Linda and a great spot for lunch. I usually get it to go, but there's plenty of seating and a hip atmosphere.

PLUS...You don't have to pay extra for avocado!</Text>

I have multiple food allergies...the man who helped me was very patient and cautious with my bowl. He even went into the back to verify the ingredients in a couple of the sauces. The piece of mind that he gave me is worth more than 5 stars. Not to mention that the food was super yummy!<//text>

Nice place for lunch.  Warm and inviting. Food was ok. Probably my fault for ordering the House Sauce on my bowl, but it was bland and tasteless. I then added spicy house sauce which is comprised of three sauces, the hot oil floated to the top and that is what I poured on my bowl. Really spicy. I am sure if you know what sauce you like you can get a good tasting bowl. Fish looked fresh although it tasted bland and didn't taste like tuna, salmon or scallop.</Text>

I came here because it was relatively new and I wanted to try it out. I'm a huge fan of poke bowls, and what really sets different poke restaurants apart from each other really comes down to the toppings that are included with the price you pay and the level of service you receive.

* PRICE / PORTION *
A regular bowl is $8.95 and a large bowl is $11.75. Regular is 3 scoops of fish vs a large which is 5. I wouldn't recommend getting the large unless you're really hungry or you're splitting it with somebody else.

* TOPPINGS *
I really like that they give generous portions for each topping, especially the seaweed salad which I have always had to pay for (it's free here)! I'm slightly disappointed that their avocado topping has gone from being free to an additional charge of $0.49. I also think it's strange how they have a huge amount of day-old avocado in a quarter pan when they should have just preserved the freshness of the avocado with some lemons. It looks more appealing that way, in my opinion.

The house sauce is alright. I believe it's a mixture of soy sauce and peanut oil, which doesn't really send me. Not much of a kick to it but not much flavor other than the peanut either. The sauce truly makes it or breaks it for me, so I would recommend trying out a different sauce than their house special.

* SERVICE *
The employees are NICE, but nice really doesn't cut it for me. I was very disappointed to see that one of the food service workers had so many strands of hair sticking outside of her ponytail and hat. I thought the purpose of wearing a hat was to keep hair away from the food, so why isn't anyone there to tell her to redo her ponytail? Speaking of anyone there, where was the manager on duty? Or the assistant manager? Or a supervisor? I checked in on Yelp to receive my free miso soup and neither the FSW nor the cashier had any idea about the promotion. Instead, the cashier decided to call his manager on the phone to verify the promotion rather than just honoring it. Cmon, the miso soup was only $1. I'm not so much disappointed in not getting the miso soup as I am about there not being any authoritative figure there at all.

I hope that they can make improvements with the quality of their service and the presentation of their food/toppings. Maybe then will I return to this location for a second chance.< /text>< user_id>

My kids love going there and being able to make their own creations. The girls there are awesome & full of smiles. Even when there is a crowd they never seem overwhelmed. I don't think they have ever made the same ice cream concoction</Review>

< Review>
Ordered cake batter ice cream from here on Postmates. Everything looked good till I started eating. Apparently they decided to mix in a good amount of vanilla for some reason. Won’t be getting anything at this location again.< /Review>

Good ice cream, sweet employees most of the time. Tons of different flavor combinations can be made between all the ice cream flavors and mix ins available. Lots of seating, both inside and outdoors. Not the best parking lot at this location, kind of hard to get in and out with all the traffic from the corner.<//text>

Got there near six, it wasn't packed at all. There was fast, efficient, and courteous service. Prices are appropriate for the quality. This place has good reviews for a reason.</text>

The ice cream is delicious, of good quality. The selection is between 10-12 flavours whilst the combination variation is still possible. The ice cream staff are friendly overall. Seating is okay.

My date and I ordered cinnamon ice cream with peanuts and the cinnamon apples... and Oh Yum! Just like an apple pie a la LA Mode!<//review>

The staff is always friendly and respectful. If you are unlucky enough to get there during a rush they will still greet you as serve everyone as quickly as possible while staying up beat and friendly to all who come through their doors. This establishment is top notch</Text>

I have visited few other times love the variety offered. I have purchased gift cards for my nieces and nephews for holidays they are always thrilled to to get them. We visited today trying the Carmel frappacino for first time and my husband had the chocolate shake as well. I'm not sure if employee was inexperienced (which I think he was new) my frappacino was so watery..mostly ice with little Carmel flavor. Chocolate shake was not very good either. I will continue to visit but was not pleased with either of these items. Thank you for your time</text>

<text>Cant ever go wrong with Coldstone. Might spend a bit more than you would like to on ice cream but totally worth it. Im not sure if selling boba drinks there is the greatest idea yet but I tried one minus the boba and it was good.</text>< GmapID>

It was our first time looking for engagement rings. We entered the store greeted by Victor. He was so friendly and a patient.  I tried on 8 rings and he listened to all my wants and I found my engagement ring !! The staff is great and so helpful, they did everything possible to get what we wanted. Great customer service!<//review>

My daughter have been coming to Don Robertos for a year now. She had low down payment and low monthly payments.  Their staff their is amazing. I decided to try them out and got approved on the spot. My payments are really low. I would recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

If you are ever looking for a jeweler... DO NOT come here. Maria is unprofessional. Will NEVER EVER EVER recommend this place due to her. Asked to speak to the owners and was just acting stupid. PLEASE GO ANYWHERE ELSE.</Text>

They make it almost impossible to give notice that you are leaving. They don't make it easy to get a unit or leave a unit.

I like the cleanliness, but do wish you didn't have to pay 💯 dollars for using the gate after 8 pm. I forgotten my keys to my car and I had to wait till morning to get them.. I think 9-10 PM would be better.< /Text>

Very expensive, rude employees who like to threaten you that they will raise your rent 3 times the amount if you dont play by the rules that they make up per issue. FYI the issue was putting tires on my racecar before loading it on my trailer....< /Text>

<text>The locks are spring loaded and extremely difficult to lock closed. The units and property are really nice. There are very strict rules.. like getting 3x charged if you're inside the gate a minute past 8. Also, having to enter your code in per car, even if someone you know is following behind you.< /text><rate>3< /rate>< Pics>

Huge place with lots of weird size options. Everything is really clearly explained just remember that you have to give a notice to vacate 30 days before you do it they'll charge you an additional month.

They're currently doing a three month move in deal.</Text>

Whatever the office tells you, be sure to get it in writing. Been burned twice by the dishonesty of the office over the last 5 years. There's plenty of other places nearby who actually appreciate your business and will do what's right to earn it.<//review>

Great Facility nice and clean. Lots of new units,They go over the lease with you and give you a copy to keep, if you read the lease you will understand the rules clearly. They told me when I signed my lease that you CANNOT extend your 30 day notice that you must put in a new one if you do not move out on time. You also store at your own risk, you are storing at an outside facility and you never know what someone has stored next to you!!<//text>

What a fantastic place to store all your extra goods! I have had a wonderful experience storing at this facility and will never look at another facility for my needs. The staff is an absolute treasure to be around. and the facility itself is clean and easy to access. The service is beyond what you would expect from a self service facility and the access to utilities is a nice touch as well. I love being in business with Erle Road Self Storage.< /review>

When going to get our belongings out of storage we realized there had been rodents all over our things and chewed threw some boxes. When I called the front desk they were not very helpful and told us they only do pest control when asked. First time renting a unit and it was a learning experience.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

As long as you don't realize you packed your passports by accident an hour after closing, and hours before your flight leaves for Korea; you might be fine storing your stuff here. Don't fall for the promise of someone that lives on site and an after hours service. When I called the after hours and explained my delemma, I was told it wasn't an emergency. Apparently they only consider vandalism an emergency.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><review>So the facility us top if the line in technology. (And you pay for it for sure in their pricing) Then again they have to be because of their location. What I don't like is that when you put in a 30 day notice and they advise they will put an extension on it, then turn around and cancel your 30 day and charge you for the month, that is just bad business. I will not go back! Manage needs to keep her accounts right or it us going to start costing thus place dearly by losing customer$!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This is the best barber shop around!  Cesar always does a great job, making sure I am happy with the cut and will always ensure it's a clean and stylish look.  Make an appointment before you go, they usually are booked up quickly.< /Review>

Today I tried out this barbershop for the first time. It was a really great experience. The barber that helped me out was James and he was very professional and also chill to talk to throughout my haircut. The option to pay ahead of time while making an appointment online is pretty cool and convenient. I haven’t had the greatest experience with hair salons over the years and decided it was finally time to go to a barbershop. I’m Glad I found this one. Definitely look forward to coming back for my next haircut! 💯< /text>

I’ve been going here for the past year or so. Noel is who I trust with my hair. Having places mess my hair and beard up time after time and then having to wait for it to grow back and try somewhere new was frustrating. No more of that. EightNine Barbers is where I go every time now. They’ve upped their standards to properly deal with Covid and I feel 100% safe getting my hair cut.<//Text>

I went to this place for the first time. My appointment was with James. I went in for a beard trim. I was very impressed with his barber skills. He did a great job. The shop is very clean. James did a good job of sanitizing everthing before working on my beard. Cool place to get a cut.<//review>

EightNine Barbers is a great place to get quality haircuts. Stumbled upon this place about a year ago and I’ve loved it ever since. Cesar is my go to barber but everyone in there is great! Would definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for a great barbershop experience!</review>

Cool spot, a little disappointed I didn’t get a true straight razor shave. Clippers and shaver used first before using the straight razor.  That should be a disclaimer on there website also inside the shop. Maybe it was the barber I used, I didn’t have time to go anywhere else to get shaved for date night with my wife.</text>

<text>I brought my boyfriend to get his hair trimmed and a mid fade, they did a horrible job. This place left his head looking like a mushroom. My boyfriend had absolutely no hair from his neck to the middle of his head. They didn't even bother to take off his sideburns he looked like he had a sunglasses tan by the way they shaved off his hair. Thankfully my father was able to trim down the top of my boyfriends head and as well round it out. I absolutely will not becoming back. $20 bucks is better spent somewhere else.</text>< Pics>

Brother went for a hair cut today... came back looking exactly how he left the house. Was looking for a place closer to home but we will stick with fades! 20 bucks for nothing and now its too late to even have it fixed by tomorrow ( kindergarten graduation)< /text>

<Text>My first time having Alyssa cut my hair, and I am THRILLED with the job she did. I keep my hair very short, and I've had a hard time finding a stylist who doesn't make me look like a blockhead, or leave ridges around the sides, or just basically LISTEN to what I want. Alyssa did a perfect job, and I'm really looking forward to going back.<//Text>< pics>

Razor's Edge has quickly become my favorite place for haircuts. Alyssa is awesome and friendly, much like the rest of the staff. I have never had a bad experience with them and have nothing but excellent things to say.

With covid-19, they have made big efforts to keep their employees and clientele safe which I very much appreciated. It was nice to get a haircut in a safe and welcoming environment after not having one for 9 months due to shutdowns.

I would highly recommend them to anyone.< /text>

I have long and thick hair so it’s usually a long and tiring process + expensive at most salons, but I think it’s pretty reasonably priced here, and it’s not too painful sitting in a chair for 4 hours while getting my hair dyed. They are doing lots of precautions because of coronavirus which I think is good. Not a ton of people in the salon these days except the stylists, and they clean a lot so I feel it’s safe. I recommend going to Trisha for color.<//review>< Time>

Great job, this was the second visit for a hair dye retouch, never any 'halos' effect, very natural looking. I scheduled online, very easily. Jen was amazing! She doesn't up sale any products or services & is just a pleasure to converse with.  I think I found my new favorite hair stylist for the reading area. I challenge anyone to prove me wrong & find a better one in this area.</Text>

I got my hair cut by Sara Potter, and she did an excellent job! She took what I wanted into account and told me what was and wasn't feasible with my hair type, and still managed to meet in the middle. 5/5 stars!

The decor inside was also nice and relaxing, and some areas were closed off with a few walls acting as partitions so it felt very cozy.<//review>

It all depends who you get for your hair cut. I go here when my regular place is booked up. Love the online booking.<//review>

<Review>Good food, but won't be returning. We ordered 3 kids meals (grilled cheese w / lemonade @ $6 each), 1 bacon avocado burger combo w / lemonade ($10.95), 1 yorker burger combo w / lemonade ($10.95), 1 order of buffalo fries ($6.45), and 5 shakes ($2.50). When we got to the window, we were told it would cost $79.XX. I asked why it was so high. We determined the milkshakes were the problem. We wanted the $2.50 shakes - they gave us the $4.45 shakes. I asked them to give us the $2.50 ones since they hadn't been made yet. I was informed that the shakes would only cost $2.50 if they replaced the drinks in the meals. So I asked for all 5 lemonades to be switched to the shakes and leave the lemonades behind. They said they couldn't do that for the kids' meals, so my husband said it's fine - just pay the $79.XX. So we paid. We got our order and when we got home we were disappointed. We realized we had only gotten 4 lemonades instead of the 5 we paid for, the bacon avocado burger had no bacon on it, and there was MAYBE half a slice of cheese at best on it. The food was good, but I did think it was weird that the kids' meals had significantly more fries than the adult combo meals. We were just annoyed and won't come back.< /Review>< Pics>

The best Shakes of any burger spot (yes, incl'd IN N Out). Chicken tenders are giant and juice and a great value! The burgers are classic and delicious. The menu has lots of exciting options (sauces and meats...) But the really excel at everything. We've been drive thru regulars for the entire pandemic. Location is super convenient to the 405.<//Review>

<review>The food is great but I have hard time with  one of the male staff working in the kitchen using the women's restroom and leaving urine on the seat and the floor. He said the men's room was busy so he used the ladies room. I will stick with the Lomita location so I can still be a customer of the South Bays best.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Never been, and was surprised how delicious everything was. The only knock is the inconsistency with locations. The other location was still good, but this particular one made the burgers/fries better< /Text>

<Text>I got a single patty burger and all the ingredients in the burger tasted fresh. I usually feel bloated and oily after eating burgers, but I felt light after eating this 100% plant-based burger. The house sauce added a delicious kick of flavor to the burger, and I'd love to try more of their sauces in the future.<//Text>< pics>

Damn Good Burger. Recommend the Shroomer or get a regular burger with bacon and blue cheese! Both are Fire...and same with Fries and Onion Rings. Great Spot for a very picky and particular guy.</text>

They have drive thru & inside pickup.  We ordered hamburgers, fries & drinks.  Food tasted good,  would have been great if they had gotten our order correct. One of our hamburgers was just bun, meat & lettuce. They forgot the cheese, tomato, pickles & mustard; of course we didn't realize until we were home so way to get it fixed without going back. Very disappointing!<//Review>

Burger City Grill is me and my sister's favorite place to eat. We enjoy the customer service that we get, each time we place an order. We especially love the fact that they are attentive to the fact that she is hard of hearing, and can sometimes not be able to understand what is being asked of her, or said, while trying to place an order through the drive-through. We also love the fact that they try to do their best to make sure that they get our order correct. We love the fact that they do what they can to go over the order several times, to make sure that it's correct.< /Review>

They make delicious burgers and the hands down favorite of mine is the box combo which comes with a burger, fries and two chicken strips. Drink is extra.< /Text>

This place is too careless. I told them clearly say about chicken burger and they give me beef burger. It’s happened 3 time too much careless people. If person is allergic to something they need to understand that not just play with someone life.</text>

Food cooked fast and properly. Burgers were GREAT and very moist. Fries were different but cooked just right. Employees were curious and prompt.
Will continue to eat at this establishment.< /Text>

Food was delicious! The burger was tasty and the crispy pickles added to the flavor. If you’re not a pickle person, no worries, the burger is still great without them. Fresh cut fries are definitely a plus. The lobby was clean but I gave it 4 stars because this place could use a better a/c.<//Review>

Good burgers. It is a little pricey for what you get but it's pretty good. The chicken strips are as good as the burgers. I love that they have a covered patio where I can sit with my dog. It's also nice having it just down the street from me</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I go to Burger City once a week. Very clean, fast service. The food is amazing. I always get the Santa Monica burger with no onions or lettuce but add mushrooms. Mushrooms are so good. Burger is always juicy and thick just like the bacon. There side of ranch and bbq sauce is so damn good you have to try it. Milkshake is thick and refreshing. Chicken strips and frys are not greasy but fresh and crispy. Every time i go it is always the same so i know it wasnt just a good day. For 2 of us and all that food i mentioned is about $28. Wich is a great price because we actaully take the chicken strips home because its so much food. Try it! You will be hooked!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCJiTEuaxuc8uKIIxMofs2ginM7RdsBqSKQF_r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYVziDiEbYvCfigXLpswzrXbNxUL-glylKeb4g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

I was really disappointed after hearing great things about it. I ordered the $8 lunch special and got a soggy hamburger, under cooked fries and over cooked chicken strips. Many people have great things to say about the place so maybe ill try it again.< /review>

<Review>Business needs to honor hours of business. My family showed up at their parking structure at 10:10PM Friday, 1/10/2020. Burger City Grill hours of bus sign reads they close at 10:30PM. While waiting for additional company to join us an employee places a cut out piece of cardboard on door (@10:12PM)  that reads 'closed for maintenance'. Seriously?! Rude and a disservice to their customers. We like this place and often refer to friends and family, yet if this is how employees treat their customers then my good reviews are out the window!!<//Review>< pictures>

I come here  7-14 times a month and their burgers never disappoint. Looks exactly as advertised and tastes better than it looks. In my opinion, the fries taste wayyy better than In-N-Out fries however i do think BCG's fries get colder faster. All smoothies are 👌👌. The restaurant itself looks amazing and the outside padio is nice looking and very open. Staff are amazing and very kind.  Ide pick this burger place any time any day.<//text>

Start with we eat here often and enjoy the food.  Yesterday we had a burger, chicken strips and onion rings that was it.
The strips were overcooked the burger was burnt.   They were not as busy as many times  before.

My husband and I were so sick all night.  We did not eat anywhere else during the day.  All we can figure is the onion rings we shared that were deep fried.  Not sure what happened but the food should not have been in the condition it was.
Sorry not a good day at the grill.</Review>

The burgers there are DOPE. No joke. Fresh, with melty cheese and crispy lettuce with a hot, fresh bun and tomatoes along with crispy and flavorful pickles and a savory sauce. That is a good burger. All for $6! Highly reccomend the B.C.G. Signature Burger for newcomers or hardcore burger lovers. Great selection, great staff, and awesome shakes. 10/10!</review>

I've been going since they opened..I go at least twice a week. The chicken tenders are fantastic. The hamburger are great too with   a lot of beef. You may need to wait  a few minutes, because they cool to the other as it comes. So I don't mind waiting. Try it out You won't be disappointed.</text>

Burger city grill not like any other grill and for the most part it is located in a area of North Torrance that is hardly changed over 50 years some upgrades the park has been redone it’s beautiful and the library has updated themselves but as far as the town it’s just a quiet little town on the North side of Torrance plenty of schools very productive an active town. Burger city grill sits right where the Brawley hut burgers that has been there for 30 years or so before that it was a gas station in the 60s and 70s. Back to Burger city Grill absolutely fantastic service the minute you approach the register The whole team welcome you it is comforting it’s not like fast food that were used to. I think the whole team needs to be recognized they are doing a wonderful job their attitudes are great they give you a little bit of history of the Burger city Grill family friendly great potato chips made from scratch. It looks great at night as well with all the lights. I will return for a sit down lunch or dinner I was passing through I walked in to take some stuff to go. Welcome to the neighborhood Burger city grill.<//review>

No issues at all! My 1st time going there. Burger was worth trying it again. Fries were like fresh with some skin left on. Love the bun! Meat was large, in flavor.  Need to find one closer to home.  Lol

<text>1 of 2 Burger City Grills in the area. This location is much smaller than the Lomita location. The consistency of the orders is great. I only order like 1 or 2 of the signature burgers between both locations and this location makes it more consistent. They also have an outdoor area for larger parties. The only reason for a star reduction was because no brewed unsweet iced tea.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Date>1552672626308< /Date><resp>None</resp><Text>Downgraded my review from 5 stars.

Previous review said: "Onion Rings thick & juicy inside."  Forget that. They've changed.

Last 3 times I got BCG Onion Rings they were hard, salty. Instead of thick slices of sweet onion, most rings were just skin or very thin slices. For $5 I got fewer than generous amounts they used to give. Considering how terrible they were, maybe that's just as well.

Chicken Tenders: Last recent orders very salty & overcooked. My friends said the same thing.

French Fries, also not nearly as good as before.

In fairness, let me say I don't eat hamburgers; can't comment on those. But for what I was eating, gave them 3 chances to get Onion Rings & Chicken Tenders right and they didn't. Not going back.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely the best chicken strips anywhere, inexpensive and always on point. Fries are great but sometimes they don't put enough seasoning but that's just me. I've never tried the burgers, i can't get past the chicken:)< /review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>This place is excellent. On my first-time visit I tried the Yorker, make sure you tell them to grill your pastrami it brings out the flavor. The burger was absolutely phenomenal. Grilled to culinary perfection. Definitely worth taking a visit. Only reason I didn't give B.C.G five stars is because they didn't have onion rings and that's what I really had a taste for  but the fries are fresh cut and you don't see that in most places these days. Oh did I mention they're to die for !!!! Thank you to the Torrance crew for making my experience and excellent one. I'll definitely be back soon.<//text>< Pictures>

I love the chicken tenders, however if you want to watch monday night football go somewhere else the manager keeps the remote for the tv in the office the staff can't change the channel, so long story short i watch tmz and had a burger.. Was not happy this is the second time this happen, in the future i will go to a place that is aware of sports game nights.< /Text>

<Review>I had "The Yorker", burger with pastrami. Not just pastrami, grilled pastrami... the crunchiness and smokiness makes a great combo on the flavor. Also, $3 beers after 5pm. The fries are ok, so back to the burger. It's juicy, a bit spicy, and the crispy pastrami takes it over the top. They have 3 beers, an IPA a blonde, and a third beer. They are, uhm.. Beers. They work. While the beer price is awesome, this is a restaurant, so will need to get back in line to get a beer at the register. It feels weird. Then, again, the burger is awesome.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Usually a great burger. Tonight it was like there was a jar of mayonnaise on the 2 burgers. It took 5 napkins for us both to wipe it off. Soggy bun because of it. You could only taste mayonnaise.  Fries were good. When we told two employees they laughed and said sorry, sorry.< /review>< pictures>

Best burger in the area!  BCG always comes through strong with the flavor and the service!  The actual burger patty here taste great - everything else is standard issue anywhere you go i.e. lettuce, tomato, pickles... etc.  What makes this place repeatable is the flavor.  You can't fake flavor.</Review>

I love this place, the service is very fast. The burgers are big and fresh, the French fries are very good and natural too. We love their ranch sauce with the fries. Is free is you ask for an extra one. A burger is around $10. You have refill drinks, inside the decoration is nice and modern and always clean. You can go drive thru too if you prefer.<//review>

Great place for burgers, they use fresh ingredients, their hand cut fries are better than In N Out, and I am a big fan of In N Out.  Their award winning shake I order In N Out shakes better.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I’ve only been once. I walked in, waited in line, ordered, handed over my burger city grill gift card to pay (was given it as a gift) and the cashier informs me that they do not accept gift cards. The gift card only works apparently at other locations. No where does it say this on the gift card. Never heard of a franchise where only some locations accept their own franchise’s gift cards, and if this is their policy, it should say so on the card, in a preferably obvious way. I left. didn’t try the food. Wasted an hour.  Absolutely absurd.<//Text>< pics>

Burger city Grill has really great chicken tenders they have a chicken tender Tuesday where it’s buy one get one free that’s usually when I go. Last time I was there I had to wait a little longer after someone cut me in line and the guy who worked there offered me a free drink which is very sweet of him because I was having a very rough day. Thanks BCG! Also they have local craft beer there for a very affordable price.< /Review>

We waited over 25 minutes in the drive  thru for a cheese burger and drinks. They messed up the entire order and we had to wait longer. They didn't apologize and were very rude. Never coming here again.<//review>

Keep getting burnt left over. Spread usually pretty good. This time salty as hell. Now that I suggested to please not give scraps, fries are not cooked at all. 😡<//review>

Pricey, but QUAL- I -TY!  You can tell everything is made with a bit of TLC and all real ingredients.  Plus they have beer on draft.  Not as cheap as Mc Donald but not as bad as any restaurant. Well worth trying!  I rate them a solid A for Chicken/Burgers and Beer< /Text>

Dine In, no line... ordered a burger with cheese, no onion BBQ sauce, no spread sauce extras lettuce and fries.

16 minute wait, 3 drive thru customers served and 2 other walk up guests got their food before me. Burger came with only a single leaf of lettuce and both spread and BBQ sauce.

Not only did I wait for awhile, the order was wrong.

The meat they use their is pretty good, it doesn't feel like a lot of grease. I'll give them that.

If you don't mind waiting a long time and that they set their priority towards drive thru customers, then try a burger. They are still ridiculously overpriced and that goes to show you based on how many customers they have waiting in line.

I suppose if you wanted faster service but still wanted to eat inside, pull through drive thru then go around the corner and then bring your food inside. You'll probably shave 10 mintues off of your wait time.</Text>

Talk about a diamond in the rough. The other locations probably suggest that it's good food but where this one is located the food should not be this good. Definitely not just the local burger spot</Review>

For a drive thru burger their unbeatable by far the best burgers well worth a couple dollars more the shakes are paramount this is what a shake should be. Everyone always seems happy it's a real treat to be enjoyed with others. customer service is a nice change from other"I really hate my job, what do you want now" establishments. Only one reason why I'm not going to be eating there they need to open some up North where I'm moving been going there since they've opened on Artesia and I'm going to miss 'em</Text>

Just eat here. The burgers are great, the meats are not mcdonalds quality, and they have a burger with chili and chips. Also, top 3 places for fries of all time. You're sold, aren't you?</Review>

<text>So I'm only giving my option on the Torrance location. So I have to say was not to impressed. I went on a cold day only to find out it was colder in side then oit side. The out door patio has no heaters or if they do the employees did not turn them on. So I think ill stick to the Lomita location. Now as for the food well its not to bad.<//text>< Resp>

<Text>This was my fourth time eating here. Every other time everything was excellent. This time got home and me and my wife took a bite of the hamburger and they were raw all through the middle. Went back, manager replaced them, got home, one was still fairly undercooked. They are too expensive to have to go back and fourth 3 times to get a decent burger.</Text>< Pictures>

Pros: Very good burgers, made once order is placed, fries are great and so are there milk shakes. I've gotten the BCG single and double and the Yorker. The Oreo, vanilla and Neapolitan(not listed) shakes, very tasty.The burger patties are always moist, if you get the Yorker the pastrami does NOT tasty greasy or heavy .Con: wait time can be long whether in the drive through or inside, usually no less than 10 mins. Can be a little pricey, but definitely worth it. My fam and i frequent this place.</review>

Food was absolutely spectacular. Unfortunately it needs a little bit better manager too many customers have to wait for too long. I waited over 35 minutes for three burgers and order of french fries. That is completely unacceptable.<//review>
