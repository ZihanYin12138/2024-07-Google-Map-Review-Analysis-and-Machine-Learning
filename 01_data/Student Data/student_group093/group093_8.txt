Everyone was so nice. The Dental Assistant Carmina was so sweet. She was gentle and efficiently fast. She made sure I was feeling okay like she would ask me every minute. Dr. Waddoups was really attentive and hospitable. I felt very welcomed. It was actually my first time to go to a dental clinic without having anxiety attack. Everyone made sure I was okay. The only thing I don’t like is I only get to see them every 8 weeks 🤣😌. Thank you Miles of Smiles! To those people with dental anxiety, this is the place for you guys!

From the moment we were greeted by the receptionist through my daughter's procedure to put in her braces and finally checkout, our experience was enjoyable.  My daughter was immediately put at ease by Ms. Carmina, and Ms. Carmina and Dr. Whadoup made the experience overall pleasant.  Ms. Carmina also did a thorough job explaining what my daughter could and couldn't do with her new braces, and the office provided my daughter with a dental care kit complete with an electric toothbrush and ample dental floss.  I would take my other children here if they require orthodontics work.  Highly recommend!<//review>< pictures>

Amazing office with amazing staff! Frances helped guide us through financials of getting braces for our 13 year old. She was so pleasant and fun to deal with. She made the whole process bearable. The doctor, was funny and made my daughter laugh and feel so comfortable during her consult. I would recommend this place to anyone!<//review>

We had the best experience at Miles of Smiles! Dr. Waddoups is the best!!! We had to start the process a little earlier than expected for our son and were nervous about the process, but had no doubts after our initial consultation. Dr. Waddoups and his staff explained the process in detail and gave us a number of options to decide what worked best for our family. Everyone in the office treats you like family and are super helpful and supportive. Our son just got his braces off today and Lina and Maddie helped make his special day allthat much better! Thank you for making this such and awesome experience!</review>

Alicia at Miles of Smiles is amazing! She was so great with my son and so helpful. She was very thorough and gave my son the attention he needed and all the finishing details before his braces come off. We love the entire staff at the French Valley office and we can’t wait to see our son’s perfect smile in December. Thank you Alicia! Thank you Miles of Smiles!! ☺️</text>

Lina is and always pleasant when I’m there. She’s very knowledgeable and always quick when I’m with her.

The office feels comfortable and inviting unlike your average Orthodontist offices. The staff members are also friendly & acknowledge you when you arrive. I would highly recommend this office to anyone! I love this place!!</Text>

<Text>From the people at the front desk, the lovely hygienist/assistants that work the chairs, to the wonderful Dr Waddoups himself, we could not be more happy with the level of professional and compassionate care we receive at Miles of Smiles Orthodontics, French Valley location. Not only do they give the best orthodontic care, my daughters smile looks amazing after completing phase 1 of her treatment plan, but they are also constantly doing fun and engaging competitions/events for their patients.
Recently, my daughter won a $500 Disney gift card! All we had to do is “get spotted” with a Miles of Smiles bumper sticker on our car.  We turned in our “you’ve been spotted” card to enter the drawing for the Disney gift card and we won! Winning this gift card was so special for us because we really don’t have $ to go blow at Disneyland. This $500 gift card made it possible for our family of 3 to go to Disneyland and not feel guilty about spending $ on admission to the Park, food, and a few souvenirs.  Winning this gift card made it possible for us to create a special Summer-day memory that our family will cherish for a lifetime!  I still can’t believe it actually happened.  If you’re looking for great Orthodontic care, you really can’t get a better experience than going to Miles of Smiles Orthodontics.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80db7dda713b5911:0xf82c7d997222a185< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

The staff at miles of smiles seem to always make you feel welcomed. Carmina was great! Super friendly. I loved how she greeted my daughter when we arrived to her appt. and made her feel comfortable. She also explained my daughters treatment so my daughter was aware of what would be done. She was fast and thorough too. Thanks Carmina!!</Text>

Carmina was my dentist today, first experience with invisalines and she did amazing. Kept me notified about what was going on with my mouth at all times, as she worked she explained the whole process and what I was going to have to do over the next 200 days... She had great attitude and good customer service... I’m very impressed highly recommend!</Text>

My daughter had a great appointment with Carmina and Dr. Waddoups. They helped make my 9 year old feel comfortable about the Invisalign process and what needs to be done.  The front staff is also very helpful and friendly.  Overall great experience.  Fresh cookies at the front counter are a nice touch!< /Text>

Also the front desk receptionist is very helpful and always happy which makes the office very welcoming. Carmina was the assistant who helped me, and I really appreciated how she worked on my teeth. She was helpful, informative, and very attentive. The office as a whole is very cohesive and I can really tell they care about their patients. Thank you miles of smiles orthodontics!

UPDATE: I’m about 15 months into my treatment, and I still really appreciate the office. I had some treatment done recently that was a bit more uncomfortable than usual, but Carmina, the assistant working on my teeth, was very eager to make me as comfortable as possible. She showed empathy during the appointment and even went the extra mile by calling later that night to see how I was doing. It’s experiences like this that make the office shine, and make me appreciate it more. Thanks again!</text>< userid>

My daughter got her braces on today with Carmina.  She was great at putting my daughter at ease during the whole process!  She even went above and beyond and called tonight to make sure she was doing OK! From the moment I walked in to the consult appointment, I felt welcomed and they really have the"one big family" feel!  So glad I found this office!!< /review>

There’s always a smile and a happy greeting of some kind from a team member.  My two boys always felt happy and comfortable at their appointment.  Dr. Waddoups and the team are very thorough and detailed.  They take their time to explain and walk us through each process.  We are very thankful that we are in good hands and again I want to say how “AWESOME” you guys are.  Thank you all for creating beautiful smiles!

<review>I went in for an appointment to get fitted for an Invisalign. I had an appointment and was seen literally the moment I stepped inside of the building. It was the fastest I’ve ever been seen for any kind if appointment. For the Invisalign, I was expecting to have to have my teeth modeled using putty similarly to how braces are done, but instead my teeth were scanned and a 3D model was created on a computer screen. I was really impressed by the technology. Lina was the one attending me, and she made this a very enjoyable experience. We had pleasant small talk which really made the time fly. She showed me a rough draft of what my teeth should look like and made sure any of my questions were answered. I was really happy with the result. The Invisalign fitting was easy and cool to watch and Lina was awesome to talk to.  Overall the appointment was a 10/10.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is the best orthodontist office!  They treat everyone as friends, and the results of their work is amazing!  My daughter has been coming for almost 2 years, and we could not be happier!  They excel in communication and always make sure the paient and parents know what’s happening.  My daughters smile is so straight and beautiful!  Thanks Dr. Waddoups!!!<//review>

Wonderful relaxed experience. Dr. Waddoups and his highly efficient team helped My Daughter and myself get straight teeth with no hassle and a comfortable setting.  My Daughter was 11 when she went into hardware and I was 37. One of the great things about getting your orthodontic work with Dr. Sam is their scheduling system and the great reminders that kept us on schedule and made certain we had the best possible service and the shortest amount of time in the chair. I highly recommend Dr. Waddoups to all of my friends and family and any one in the public who wants a sincere and upfront Orthodontist with great ties to the community, and great skills at his trade.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Both my kids are patients of Dr. Jergensen and Dr. Waddoups.  They absolutely love going to the orthodontist!  Crazy, right?  There's always something fun going on from contests to fresh cookies!  They love the patient rewards program and I love not having to drag them to the ortho.  We initially came to Dr. Jergensen for a second opinion after another doctor suggested a retainer for my 7 year old son.  Dr. Jergensen felt he wasn't ready for treatment just yet and I appreciated that honesty.  We came back when he was ready and have been a part of the family ever since.  My daughter is a wiggly patient but all the girls are always so patient with her, especially Lina!  We've referred friends and will keep doing so.< /Review><user_name>Beth Koehn<//user_name><Date>1522958900138< /Date>< Response>

Whenever we need to schedule or re-schedule an appointment or make a last minute "fix it" appointment, Cathy and Nikki are so accommodating which is so appreciated with our busy schedules.

There are many orthos in our area, but I am so happy that we chose Dr. Waddoups.  He is AMAZING with the kiddos, the small and the teen.  We recommend Miles of Smiles to ALL of our friends who are in need of "bling".< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
Dr.Waddoups and Dr. Jergensen are simply amazing!! They have done a wonderful job on my Son's smile!!!.  I can not be happier with the results I call it his "Colgate Smile". My son was nervous to be worked on but both Doctors and staff are so patient him. They make him feel as if he part of the group. They engage in conversations with him  and most importantly for me they make him laugh in order to calm him down so they can work on him. He will be done while his first part of braces soon and he loves going in for his check ups.  I highly recommend them!!<//review>

<Text>Dr Samuel Waddoups, the new owner, and his team are great!  It was almost like my son forgot he was at an ortho office he had such a great time.  Friendly environment for kids and adults alike.  I loved watching kids bounce out of the office almost giggling  happy with their new braces.  My 11 year old son is beyond thrilled with the work he is getting done!</Text>< UserId.>

Dr. Waddoups and his staff are Amazing! My two daughters and I got our braces here. They all are so friendly and make each visit a great experience. The staff is so helpful. Lina, Martha, Michelle, Coya, to name a few are so wonderful. Love them! I highly recommend Dr. Waddoups!< /Review>

Dr Waddoups is now in Corona and I'm so excited.  My oldest son did Invisalign and another son did tradition braces.  I'm very pleased with the results. I will definitely have my younger kids go to Dr. Waddoups.   He's great with kids, is very positive, very thorough, up to speed with the latest orthodontic technology, and just a great honest guy.  I highly recommend Dr. Waddoups.</text>

My experience has been incredible, I went to different consultations before meeting with Dr. Waddoups and his staff in Murrieta. They are all very friendly and knowledgeable. Knowing my son is in good hands makes all the difference. I will definitely recommend our orthodontist to my family and friends. #TeamJergensenWaddoupsOrthodontics

I would like to start off by saying that all the staff was very friendly and the facility was very clean.  I took my 8 year old daughter for a consultation and will be honest my daughter was a bit nervous at first.  Doctor Kawata and staff were very friendly and made us feel welcomed.  He went through explaining in full detail her current condition and recommendations.  I was very impressed with his explanation and he made sure I understood the next steps.  I felt at ease knowing that he would work with my daughters primary dentist on his plan.  My daughter left very excited and can’t wait to get started.  I left completely satisfied knowing my options and know I made the right decision to begin her treatment at Dr. Kawatas office.  I would highly recommend this facility.< /Text>

Dr Kawata was my children's orthodontist over 10 years ago. My kids actually I liked going to their appointments. His staff is always kind and helpful. So,  when I needed advice this year about a potential challenge with my teeth, he's the first orthodontist I thought of and the only one in the inland empire I would trust.  True to my expectations, he spent time to thoroughly go over my options.... At the end , based on what I said I wanted, his advice was to leave my teeth as they are. I would recommend Dr Kawata as a highly trusted and skilled Orthodontist.< /Text>

He was extremely patient, very knowledgeable, and gave me an honest assessment of the issue and recommended several options without seeking to monetize my problem. In fact, his ultimate recommendation was to not treat this minor issue. He fully considered the problem from the patient’s point of view rather than from the provider’s. His staff, Chantal, treated me very pleasantly. I would most definitely choose Dr. Kawata and his office for any potential dental issues I might have in the future.<//text></record>

<Text>Everyone at Dr. Kawata’s office is excellent, and we have been incredibly pleased with the care they’ve given to both of our kids. Since the pandemic, they have reopened with extra measures, such as having non-patients wait in cars, having masks on in the office, and extra hand-washing and mouth-rinsing for patients prior to being seen. We appreciate their care and responsibility during this time, and always!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<review>Don’t even think about anyone else! Dr. Kawata may not be the least expensive you can find, but you will come to realize why the value is well worth the higher price. His expertise is renowned and verified in many ways. He will take his time to do things perfectly - even if it goes beyond the timeline for which you were charged. Beyond that, the office is a tightly-run ship. You won’t sit around waiting forever for your appointment. In the 3+ years we’ve been going, we’ve had to wait maybe 3 times total. That alone is worth the investment. Finally - everyone is just simply nice, pleasant, & fun! I will miss them when we are done?!?!  Could not recommend more highly!!< /review>< pics>

<Review>The office is very friendly and all who work there are so caring and completely explain everything. Dr Kawata is so personable  and amazing in every way. His knowledge in this field is so large and it shows. As a parent you are able to go back with your kids to watch the procedures and if you choose to wait up front he makes sure to find you and discuss what has gone on with your child that day as well as what is our next steps. They text for reminders and thank you for visiting and everyone makes you feel completely at ease and welcome.

More companies should have this type of business style, work ethic and patient care then they would just as successful.  Word of mouth is the best advertisement. I would Recommend Dr Kawata and his staff to everyone!</Review><user_id>107891210960648808045</user_id><rating>5</rating><pics>None<//pics>< date>

Practically perfect in every way (just like Mary Poppins)!!!  Seriously though, Dr. Kawata is truly great, not just as a dentist, but in his care for his patients. He explains everything extremely well, and was compassionate in his dealings with me.  I am very happy I will be under his care for my orthodontic needs. He also took care of my daughter’s orthodontic needs many years ago and was fantastic, so I am a repeat customer, and a satisfied one!< /Text>

He’s the best in the west!
Dr. Kawata & his team are truly exceptional at the service they provide.
The braces changed my smile for the better and i am grateful for how he took the initiative of giving me the opportunity of a lifetime.
Without Doctor, braces would have cost me most of my paycheck but he worked a deal of a lifetime 🤝
Wish I could upload a picture of the changes, but you won’t regret receiving services from this place located in Corona!

Dr. Kawata is a wonderful, caring orthodontist with an efficient and respectful office staff! We have had the pleasure of being patients here for over 12 years. My third and final child will be getting her braces off this year, and we could not be happier with everyone’s results. 😁I have recommended this office to so many people.  We will truly miss seeing Dr. Kawata and his awesome staff when it’s time to say goodbye.< /text>

<text>I can’t imagine how you could do Kids orthodontics better than this.  Garrett’s results are fantastic, his explanations of what he is doing and why, are thorough and simple and backed up with xrays that show the progress from when you first arrived.  We are always seen on time with no waiting and this has been the case for 2 years worth of appointments.  The rest of the staff are charming, clever and kind.  A well deserved 5 stars.  I would have given 6 if they let me:)<//text><name>Marie Poppins TV<//name>< Time>

Dr. Kawata and his staff were wonderful. They made my son and I feel so comfortable. I went in to find out if he needed braces and they did X-rays and inspected his teeth to see if he was in need of them. They did a thorough exam and explained everything to me. He took his time to make sure I fully understood what was necessary. I highly recommend him to anyone who needs braces. They are very friendly, organized and professional. Thank you Dr. Kawata and staff!<//text>

<review>I went to Kawata as a child and now as an adult I still get compliments on my smile. I now bring my 8 year old that has SEVERE dental anxiety and Dr. Kawata and his staff are extremely patient and always available to calm her and make her comfortable. She has required A LOT of dental correction and thankfully they were able to correct it early enough to avoid surgery as an adult. Love love love Dr. Kawata and his staff</review>< gmapID>

I felt genuinely welcomed here, which is a lot to say for a place that only causes pain when you go. Everyone is very personable and seem genuinely interested in their patients. I had braces from here for 2 years and every visit was a pleasant experience, even when I got them tightened. I'd definitely recommend it!</review>

Dr. Kawata was very wonderful, explaining all things regarding my son’s problem. He told us to wait for 1 year later since according to him my son is too young to start the treatment with the kind of problem that my son has right now. My son just turned 7. After carefuly checked my son’s mouth, teeth, jaw as well as the x-ray result he explained the current situation and what kind of problem that may happen in the future. I really appreciate his honesty and not to rush us to start any treatment that shouldn’t be necessary for now. He also really knows how to handle children and makes them feel relax. My son was having a good time there. Also his staffs were great. We definitely will be back next year. Awesome team!<//text>

Where do I start? This place is absolutely amazing. The staff is the most friendly, genuinely nice people I have ever met. They make you feel like part of their family right when you walk through the door. Dr Kawata is the most professional, kind, compassionate orthodontist I have ever had the please of dealing with. (Not to mention he is a professor at USC) This place most definitely has that wow factor & leaves you feeling so happy about the decision you made in your ortho-journey 😊</Text>

He is the real deal like Holyfield . Not only is the quality of the service the best in the inland empire, but he is the only board certified orthodontist in the area & he has taught at USC school of dentistry for more than 30 years.
Also his staff are just as exceptional as him. You are in good hands while under his care!</text>

< Review>
I am just so appreciative of the warm environment and professional demeanor in the office. Dr. Kawata is very thorough with his step by step process for my daughter, amd wont encourage you to have work that is unnecessary or non-conducive to your needs. The front and back office staff persons are amazing....Robyn is my favorite!< /Review>

There is zero question of where to go for all things ortho in Corona/Norco/Riverside area. My daughter's experience was so great that I decided to have them fix my smile too! They always make you feel welcome, and we always look forward to seeing everyone there. I recommend this office  to people even if they "think" their children might need ortho.

<text>If you are looking for a perfect Orthodontist and team to go to or take your children look no further. Dr. Kawata is not only extremely talented in his line of work itself (I swear he can see your full treatment with a look at your teeth..it’s a super power of his) but he has made sure his overall office experience is top of the line. This place is super kid friendly no scrubs, cute wash station for the little ones, get to design your retainer, flavored gloves, and friendly smiles all around. I am 26 and a returning patient of Dr Kawata I did not wear my retainer and after 12 years my bottom front teeth shifted a bit. When I was a kid I would look forward to my ortho appointments. My mother and brother are also former patients of Dr. Kawata. My family trusts this office. Side note, when I first thought about fixing my bottom teeth again I went to an ortho office for an estimate right down the st. from my house in Eastvale but it felt like they were all about money (Eastvale office, complete separate business).
Dr Kawata’s office is straight to the point with your treatment, and overall is absolutely perfect.I will bring my children here. Thank you Dr. Kawata and team!< /text>< Pics>

Outstanding place with a variety of different billiards tables to shoot pool. The food here is where it divides itself as everything on the menu is amazing!!< /text>

<review>If I were some this place up in a phrase: it has potential. The equipment itself (the tables) is taken care of well enough, however the actual location as a whole always seems like it would need some general TLC. The menu itself, although it's a pool hall, isn't bad but could use a revamp-prices are fair, and a general remodel/refresh for the entire location wouldn't do it bad either.

For 3 cushion or carom billiards, there is no better place/equipment in the whole of Southern California-this could most likely be attributed to the fact that the previous owner was one of the best 3 cushion players in the world-no joke! Those tables are better maintained than the pool tables, although the pool tables are maintained quite well-definitely far better than your average sports bar.

The crowd of regulars mostly gathers there to play "golfito" on the larger snooker tables, and the atmosphere of the place is well enough that it could be deemed "family-friendly," although there is also room for improvement here.

Bringing your own pool cue would be highly recommended, as the house cues have definitely seen better days, but if you want a fun night out to hang out with your friends, this is definitely a place to go and have a good time.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Man I love going here. I moved but wish it was here in Florida. The staff is awesome, plenty of tables both with and without pockets, great beer specials, cheap delicious bar food, seating all around for your friends that wanna watch, clean restrooms, good hourly prices. It's a perfect little community gem and makes for a good lil date night or hangout spot. No flashy lights or fancy interiors, but it's really not needed. I have a good time everytime I go and I'm always surprised by the bill and tip good because of how much value the place gives. Seen some good players here too!<//Text><name>Ashley Johnson</name><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>
{'time': 1570033465818, 'text': 'Ashley, thats the reason to come to a real Billiards Hall or Pool Hall instead of your local bar with a pool table. You will always find good players and if you are polite when you ask, most will show you what you are doing wrong and how to make your game better. The Manager or Owner can point you in the correct direction. They even have someone that teaches pool lessons.'}<//Resp>

<review>You know what?  I was pretty messed up by the time I entered College Billiards, and I STILL didn't like the vibe I got from that place.

I really like the dive-y interior, but the clientele was just so-so.

At least they had my favorite scotch.
One shot of Laprohaig and I bolted out that door.</review>< pics>

<Review>Oh boy, so it's a dive. Which is what we were expecting, but this place was way divier than anything we anticipated. There was mold in the bathroom, black mold and a lot of it. All the taps were down and we couldn't buy beer by the pitcher so our trip was pretty expensive considering the lack of ambiance. There were a lot of pool tables so that's a good thing. Also, the server girl was very nice and always made sure we were taken care of. I don't think I would go out of my way to go to this bar and I definitely won't be using the bathroom there ever again!<//Review></record>

Super good place to shoot pool and chill for reasonable prices. Maybe they can have few more games for bar and that's it. I think more college ppl would show up like in the other places.<//Text>

After reading other reviews, I wanted to make mine a little more detailed. I came up from Merced to spend a week painting in the mountains. I forgot a few things. One was paint. For such a small town, I was impressed with the amount of space this store had and the selection of various items. The local grocery store [ which i also like] has less of a selection. The paint guy there helped me pick affordable paint, tinted to a color  suited for the purpose it would be used. He made sure I had a can opener and stir stick. I picked up a couple more items and was rung out by a pleasant girl and spoke with a man about a sample I picked up on hard water stain remover. For me...great service, very helpful. There was enough staff to point me around. I would take this experience over most I have in Merced any day.</Review>

Prices are double from Lowes and home depot. Paint department is a nightmare, In capable of making black paint. They change the paint brands every couple years, mis matching previous colors, a true headache.</text>

Super clean, friendly staff that knows the products plus they have everything you need to fix it!  They didn't get their high rating from Ace for not being the best at what they do!  Come in and see what I am talking about.< /Review>

It's a good hardware store to save you a trip to the Valley. The one thing this store lacks is a quality run paint department. Every time I go in there, I'm given the run-around because they give the same excuse of either not having the type of paint I want or the color I want because they ran out of the paint mix. Either get new equipment or retrain the paint department staff.< /text>

<Review>I wanted to go buy things in the store. And they had a door bouncer. They demanded I leave my pack outside the door!. I heard of this before and the person that complied had their things stolen and the store neglected responsabity. So, I didn't follow those instructions and the door bouncer acted as if they wanted to fight. Needless to say I'm not going to be a customer there. They need a serious attitude change< /Review>< Pictures>

<username>M T<//username><Time>1595782453736</Time><review>I wish I could give zero stars.My husband and I recently visited this location. We are following ALL the state and government guidelines and wear our masks EVERYWHERE. We walked in wearing our face coverings and were shopping minding our own business. My husband simply put the mask below his nose for a second while we were way more the 6ft away from anyone and everyone! One of the store associates yelled from behind the counter that it had to be covering his nose. While we know the mandate and continue to follow all of the guidelines I truly feel that policing regular customers that are striving to follow all the rules is highly unnecessary. Especially yelling across the store. We will not be going back even though it is a convenient stop being close to our home. From now on we will be going to Coast as there employees are extra helpful and don’t feel the need to police their patrons.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>As always a great time visiting and shopping at Foster Ace Hardware, other businesses in Mariposa could learn something from Troy on how to keep us coming back.
Keep up the great job Troy.

Nice atmosphere and employees are very helpful. However, they don't have a very large selection on RV parts.<//Review>

Great Stihl shop, good customer service. I buy stuff here because I know they'll back it up with in house repairs, etc. Ace has a bad website (it let me order a tractor they can't actually send me in CA), but the people here make up for it and more.</text>

Wow.
I got the Taiwanese breakfast. It was delicious. Between the quality of the rice and the flawless execution of the eggs Id have a baseline of a great breakfast. But the welcoming home-like feel of the establishment and genuine kindness of the owners is what will have us making the five hour drive back down here for the best breakfast, semi regularly. In a word: grateful.
Will be raving about this place to friends and family for the next week or so to come.

<rating>4<//rating><review>It is typically unclear what counts as a "family" restaurant. There are pizza parlors. There are burger joints. The local Mexican food. Prepare to have your mind blown, as this is possibly THE family restaurant.
Perhaps it is the bias that comes from getting grilled cheese here since I was five. Maybe it was the time two years ago, when I worked out a custom dish with the chef. (Presumably Amy?) Maybe it is just that they recognize you after you do not visit for years.
In any case, it is a good, typically quiet, place to have a meal. If you like diner food at its least pretentious, look here... But also their noodles? The food is good. Just... Trust me.< /review>< Pics>

We have been there twice and plan on going back. Service is fast and food is made fresh with each order. We have had the fried rice plain and with ham, both are very good, along with the sweet and sour pork, it is lightly breaded  with a yummy sauce. Next I want to try the chow mein it seems like all the tables around me orders it, when I'm there, so it has to be good.< /review>

Having breakfast in a family setting like this is an enriching and delicious way to start your day!  Amy and Mr. Amy care a great deal about their restaurant and customers.  Their positive attitude permeates through the whole place,  creating an atmosphere that is welcoming and food lovingly seasoned with their dedication to service.   As a small breakfast spot, this is a one of a kind experience...just off the 101, the locals appear to eat here ritualistically and it's a must try for anyone just passing through!  Glad I had the chance to try it; the reviews ring true and this is the best breakfast within several hundred miles.  Thanks!</text>< name>

<text>Amy cooks up a delicious breakfast, with good size servings. Darrell is a delight, full of friendly conversation. He brings water right out "to hydrate", and brought us a plate of the most delicious cut up oranges "for Vitamin C". The Denver omelette (With sausage instead of ham? No problem at all!) was overflowing, the country potatoes with onions were beyond yummy, the pancakes were fluffy, and the eggs, sausage & English muffin were perfect. Coffee was amazing. The place is small, but charming - a must stop on the drive through the beautiful mountains!<//text><time>1530469262700</time><Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>115247926093960253685<//user_id>< GmapID>

Coffee is a little on the strong side but the good food and good customer service wow more than makes up for the speed of getting a meal. They really don't mind going out of their way to prepare a special meal that may not be on the menu or specialize in it to your request. And the great news they use Liquid coffee creamers.<//Review>

Would rate less if I could. Way too expensive for food. Food is standard for it's kind. The Chinese part of it is gross. Stick to the American food, but you'll get better and for cheaper elsewhere.</Review>

Awesome coffee, and while the wait was 45 minutes it was worth it! Everything appeared to be made fresh, and they are very thoughtful, including serving the apparently required cold/hard butter on the plate with the biscuit and then softer butter on the side :)</review>< gmap_id>

Amy's delight is delightful. It can be super busy at lunch so show up early..  honestly thier is 2 choice's, the biscuits and gravy or the wonton soup.. the other options are probably good too, but don't mess with perfection. Enjoy< /text>

Amy's Delight is everything the name suggests.  A small town dinner that is big on flavor.  A casual dinning expierience with small yet flavor packed menu. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The restaurant was very clean.  With all the cooking being performed, there was no overpowering cooking smells noticed. A wonderful place that I look forward to dining at again and again.</Review>

<text>Heard this place good for years...... finally tried it. I was always worried about a place that serves Asian and American food..... so I tried the kungpoa chicken. It was the worst I have ever tried! It had a chicken gravy for the sauce and I was given a bottle of chili paste to make it "kungpoa" ..... very disappointed never going back.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Up in the morning on the weekend to break out a bunch of errands and chores. Decided to grab some breakfast so I stopped in. I waited a little while at the door without anyone noticing I was there, I thought maybe they were busy and shrugged it off and they pointed out a table for me. I sat down waiting for a menu or anything really. I watched the older gentleman walk back and forth in front of my table bringing the two ladies who had come in before me their things. First a menu, then back and forth for water, then back and forth for silverware... not a glance at me or menu or anything. I figured "that's fine, maybe there's another waiter for my table. Then a couple comes in. They get seated immediately and get their menus before I've even talked to a waiter let alone gotten my menu. When the people who come in 10 minutes after you get their menu before you do.... there's a problem. At this point they're just being rude or lazy or both. I got up and walked out. If there was a zero star I'd give them that.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>Small, fresh food, good people, it doesn't get much better.  The staff is amazing, so friendly and willing to converse with you about everything under the sun.  Great dining experience.  It's such a small place, and everything you eat is freshly made and delicious.  If you are in Eureka, this is where you should eat.  We only had the breakfast, but their menu has a wide variety of food to eat, made from scratch.  From Chinese style food, to burgers and club sandwiches, and breakfast, they've got something for everyone.  With Amy cooking in the back, you're guaranteed a good meal 😀, THANKS AMY! and the rest of the guys helping run this local gem.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Decent fresh food and clean restaurant.  It took  a long time to get our dine in order (over 30 min). There was only one take out oder ahead of us at 2 in the afternoon.

A meal for our family of four  (patty melt, cheese burger, o rings,  egg rolls, chicken chow mein, and sweet and sour chicken with steamed rice) without drinks was over $70 (before tip).

The egg rolls (with Chinese meatloaf inside) were microwaved and then deep fried. They tasted good but we had never had that kind of egg roll filling. Chow mein was made with linquine noodles and was a bit light on flavor. Sandwiches are a la cart (waiter didn't mention). Onion rings were good. Sweet and sour chicken was great... but served over rice so the rice was drowned in sauce (not so kid friendly).  Also they don't have a kids menu.< /Text>

<Review>Only thing ok is the decent fries and soda from a can.  Chicken sandwich was AWFUL,  came from a frozen chicken breaded patti from Safeway, no flavor and I saw the lady pit my bun in the microwave.  Service was friendly, family ownedand operated,, very clean but way out dated. Unfortunately this will be the only time I will visit.< /Review>< Name>

We checked the internet for best breakfast in town. Amy's Delight had great reviews! As we walked up to the restaurant a man outside was passing by and said "they have great food inside". We were greeted by "Mr Amy" (her husband whom we never got his real name- he chided it was Mr Amy) who was truly charming and so professionally served our group. We were served fresh orange slices with our great coffee.  Three from our group got the biscuits and gravy with homestyle potatoes and onions that were delicious!. Very tasty gravy! I got the ham and cheese omelet with homestyle potatoes which came with Amy's large biscuit.  We all agreed everything was amazing! We definitely will go back when visiting family in the future.  I loved that we were able to see Amy in the kitchen cooking. She waved and said thankyou when we left. We were so happy that we had chosen Amy's Delight! It truly was a Delight!!< /review>< Pictures>

While the food isn't gourmet, it IS quite good and without a doubt, made with love and patience. We had egg foo young, which was full of whole fresh vegetables and eggs, full of flavor. Pancakes were yummy, and he made them small just for my daughter, even though they normally come larger. Small orange juice was actually very large AND he refilled it for free...and it was organic.
Kung Pao Chicken was relatively salty, but also full of flavor. Best of all is the service...amazingly sweet, full of character, and definitely a home cooked feel. Only thing missing was some background music...
We'll definitely go back.</review>

Fantastic! This is what I want in a little local eatery while traveling, if I lived here I would eat this daily. Homemade biscuits, amazing potatoes and a big, fresh chunks of a variety of Bell peppers. 10/10 would do again.</Text>

Fraud! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.
Currently filing a complaint with the BBB!
They make up reasons to charge you double, and then claim its how your policy has always been.
All the "agents" here say the complete opposite from what the next person says. When you finally get fed up, they don't want to let you cancel. Jessie is so UNPROFESSIONAL, he tried to get me to stay with this company even after I stated I didn't too. Then he texted me claiming he never said he was my insurance agent. When I told him I went someone else he said "lol" and tried to get me to come back by making up random prices. This company is so sloppy! The texts messages i received from Jessie were far from professional. I had to deal with Lilana too and she had no idea what she was talking about. She ended up charging me for a "renewal" fee and then called me a week later saying I have to start paying twice a month. I can't stress to stay away from here enough! Now they won't let me cancel my policy after I asked TWICE. Absolutely insane. If you have had issues with this company I recommend contacting the BBB like I am doing!<//Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Fraud company. Stay away. After I cancelled my policy through the main company it’s self (Bristol West). I find out my old agent Jesse reinstated it days after, he knew I was moving forward with a different insurance company. Ridiculous.

Update: Company is now reaching out. Of course it’s cancelled, I made sure it was cancelled. After days and hour long phone calls with the main company itself. They said it wasn’t reinstated although I have a letter from Bristol stating otherwise 🙄 I asked them to stop contacting me and I receive a text right after I get off the phone. Ridiculous. Anyways, Best wishes to this company.</Review></record>

Walked in not expecting to get any policy, but Jason Felix helped me find the BEST quote. Other insurance brokers are no match for Jason’s service and help. He truly cares for all his clients. If you walk into Sameday Insurance make sure to ask for Jason Felix, he’ll provide you with the cheapest rates in town for auto, motorcycle, home, and business insurance.<//review>

< Review>
Reviews about this business are quite strange. Check all the reviews, they're pretty much in the same format.

1. Reviews are quite long for a five stars. Usually when bad experiences occur that's when paragraphs upon paragraphs are made. (There are those few times when a person goes into detail about how a business or person went above and beyond and will write a long review to go into detail, but that's quite rare.)

2. Reviews have a tone of "kissing a$$" think of having a family member making a review for your business.

3. Majority of *five star reviewers* accounts only have one review in their total account history.

4. Names are mention in practically all five stars reviews. (Names being mentioned in stellar reviews are not uncommon, but for every five star review that's a pattern)

5. Reviewers names are pretty generic

6.  For being an insurance company and the reviewers having SO much good things to say, it is within human nature to show off what a great deal they got. Although, almost none mention any dollar figures or vehicle type.< /Review>

They deleted my review so be careful. They tell you a price and rush you to cancel your current insurance all for them to charge you more than what you were paying and now left with no insurance, don't trust them. They did it to my cousin too. Be safe and find a good company not this one!<//Review>

I was paying 180$ for liability with Infinity. Came here to look for a deal, ended up getting full coverage for 150$ a month on a BMW. Young man named Jason took his time to find me the best bang for my buck. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

I was having trouble with my previous insurance so I was looking for a new place I would feel comfortable with. Jesse G. Made everything so easy and my transition smooth. Every time I make my payment he shows he’s happy to help me. Very friendly! I’m so happy to have him to answer my questions if needed. He speaks Spanish which makes it easy for my dad to contact him with any questions! We like that!<//Review>

It was my first time getting insured under my own name, and i was a bit worried. Luckily, Sameday insurance took care of everything! The service provided was absolutely outstanding; great low quotes, quality insurance, excellent customer service, everything was a great learning experience. Customer representative Joe was truly down to earth and really had great vibes; definitely a very kind hearted gentleman who taught me everything i needed to know about insurance. Very convenient and helpful! Trust when i say; "Sameday Insurance has you covered!"< /review>

I spoke with Jesse, I recently moved out to California and he literally saved me. He got me insurance at a better rate than anyone else out there, and he was able to work with me with my MP and deposit amount. I recommend anyone to go through him; he actually cares about his customers and doesn’t just do this because he has to. THANK YOU JESSE! You have been nothing but amazing.<//text>

Jason is the best insurance representative I’ve ever spoken too

He’s professional and kind. His attentive skills found me a great rate with many options to consider.
At the end I found the right policy with all needed coverage

I went with Sameday insurance in Downey and Matt was very attentive. He didn’t treat me like just another number in his books. The individual attention Matt gives to each client is an example of how people should be treated. THANK YOU MATT! He didn’t pressure me into buying a policy. He explained everything in detail. I appreciate Matt for reaching out to people and asking how they’re doing. He’s very patient. I’m a single mother of an autistic 4 year old boy. Sometimes I have to go in with my son. Matt has given me a moment of peace when he gave my son some paper and a pencil to occupy himself while I took care of business</Text>

I spoke with Daniel, he was very friendly and helpful.
I was looking for new car insurance and so I was shopping around seeing which rate would be best suited for my budget. I received a call from Daniel and he quoted me at a very good rate but I still wasn't sure so I told him my situation of how I was still shopping around and he was very understanding, I didn't receive any pressure at all from him, he gave me his contact information and said that he could save the rate that he quoted me at.
I then received a call from another broker from a different company and that person was very pushy and I caved and signed up with them. The next day I regretted my decision and canceled my policy with that broker and called Daniel to see if I could get insurance with him. He told me to make sure that I was actually canceled with the other broker first before starting a new policy with him and so I did. Two weeks later I received confirmation that my policy with the other company had been canceled so I called Daniel back up and just like he said, he was able to get me the rate that he had quoted me at 2 weeks earlier so I of course signed with him.
Im super grateful about the excellent customer service that Daniel provided me with. I definitely would recommend going with this company if youre shopping around for insurance.< /Review>

I was first with this company about 7 years ago and ended up switching due to jumping onto my parent's policy at some agency down the street from me however that ended up turning out terribly when i wanted to add on a car they told me id be paying 184 a month on a new policy and it jumped to 326 when i got the bill !!

i never had that issue with this company so when Joe called me to check in , it just happened to be the right time since i was already shopping around and he was able to get me lower than what the other company originally quoted me and got me down to $165 for full coverage for my brand new 2018 charger , thanks again joe and the whole team you guys are great !</Review>

Great Customer Service and the best insurance prices that i was able to find after quoting several places. My insurance specialist was Raylynn Estrada and she was great as she was very prompt with getting back to me on any questions i had and was able to work with us on our down payment.

Jesse was very helpful. He gave us a great deal on two cars and saved us so much money. I would definitely recommend him and Sameday Insurance.</Text>

They were all way out of my budget range. Jesse at this company quoted me an insurance plan with all the benefits i was looking for.
Customer service is top notch and they respond very quickly as well. I am very glad i am not paying very high insurance rates and i got exactly what i was looking for.
I would definitely recommend Sameday Insurance, if you are looking out for one.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2cda67a4863f3:0xfb3bcdb858c04eda<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I first want to say that Matthew Casas is the bomb.com!!!!! I actually called another insurance place before calling Matthew and they quoted me some crazy prices. Then I remembered being called by this young man that really impress me with giving me a quote and really wanting to take care of me. However, I gave him a hard time and told him that I would contact him at a later date. Lastly, I remembered that Matt did not stop there I couldn't call him because i had lost his number and didn't remember his name but Matthew was persistent and sent me a letter in the mail and said if i need him please all. I was looking all over for the letter and boom!!!! I found it and the rest is history. I have insurance and Matthew is still the pleasant young man that he was the first time i meet him over the phone. Oh and yes, I gave him a hard time again today and he didn't break nor complain because he's build for this!!!!! Thank you Matthew Casas you are the man!!!!!!!

Forever Grateful

I've been coming to same day insurance since I got my drivers license 10 years ago. Gabriel always makes everything so easy for me and works with me on payments. I've gone in last minute and left with insurance right away. Hence their name . I was recently helped by Itzel. She worked with my schedule and continued to follow up with me when I was unable to come in. They are quite a drive away from me but I don't mind coming in because I know I will be given the best deal.<//Review>

Gabe has been such a big help for me! I had some bad experiences with another branch and was about to give up but luckily, Gabe was able to help me out. He was patient and polite and got me the policy I needed and made the whole process very easy and not stressful. I'll be recommending him to anyone I know that is looking for insurance< /Review>

I loved the services I received today. Ingrid was really informative and worked her hardest to seek the best rate for me, with a lil help from Gabe to seal the deal. I just want to thank you all for having such positive energy and wonderful attitudes. I will definitely be recommending your company to others. Again thank you all.</Review>

I have recommended family and friends through out the years and they have been satisfied customers as well. Every time I have an issue they don't hesitate to help me in solving it. I highly recommend sameday insurance if you're looking for an insurance company that cares for the customers needs.< /Review>< userid>

< review>
I dont even know where to begin with this place , I hate leaving bad reviews but it was too much to pass up .
I'll start off with horrible service ever from jesse when I got my insurance I was told by him everything would be fine I wouldnt have to notify the DMV time went on and Im receiving letters from the DMV saying my car has no insurance and I would have to pay a fee to get my registration back which I did and I called jesse and he of course doesn't know what happen I had already paid my month to this insurance that I "had" and I was going on to my second month so I went to Jesse and waited till he called the DMV to see what happen and not once did he ask if I was going to have my insurance all he was worried about was me trying not to get my 14 dollar fee back that he made me pay for no reason because it was his fault that it happen and when I asked if I can speak to the person from the dmv he said no so whatever I left he told me everything would be fine already and a week later I get a letter saying I have no registration anymore because there is no proof of insurance and the one that I reported is not a real insurance .
Please dont get this insurance all they care about is the money despite all the problems I had Jesse bugged so much about me making the payment he would call , text me , leave a voicemail , and an email to see if I would make my payment I was never late and I always paid it on time , I tried to wait till my 6 month lease was up but I couldn't I got out of the insurance after 3 months of having it .< /review>

Chris and Jessie helped me get a lower rate for my car insurance. They found something in my price range and got me insurance within 15 mins over the phone. I didn’t think they could find me something cheap because I had a ticket and failure to appear on my record, but they did! Thanks Jessie and Chris!< /Text>

I highly recommend Sameday insurance and Jason specifically to anyone ! Not only was he concerned with helping me out and finding me the only price but there was genuine care for me being insured, he followed up with me constantly to make sure I get the coverage and stop driving uninsured and after that still kept close contact to make sure any issues or questions I had were answered and taken care of ! Ask for Jason he’s the best !< /text>

They only care about money and getting you to sign. Don't waste your time, and their rates aren't even that good. Check out the yelp. Also prepare to get phone calls from them several years after you cancelled your policy. They actually make me wish they were telemarketers< /Review>

It was a great experience. I was having some trouble finding insurance for a decent price. Right as I was about to give up, I come across this place. I met with an agent by the name of Keyla. She was very friendly, and made the process very simple and easy. Ask for Keyla if you’re shopping around for insurance.<//review>

thumbs up!!!! Jason provided me with auto insurance over the phone on the same day I bought my car, that is how effecient and helpfull he is. He made sure that everything is okay and checks up on you every now and then, thats why you feel more secure while you're with them. I definitely made no mistake in partnering with them with regards to my insurance. Keep up the good work Jason.< /text>

<review>From day 1 my mind was put at ease by Gabriel Segarra!!! I came in feeing hopeless and frustrated and he made the process completely pain free and easy. He worked with me even with my prior tickets to get me an affordable policy the worked with my needs and budget. Gabe has never given me the run around. The entire office is excellent at staying on top of informing me of any changes or updates to my policy. Their excellent customer service provided by the staff makes coming in to pay my fees something to look forward to. Thanks Sameday Insurance 🚙<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Horrible service. Every time I call to see if I can get a lower rate for my insurance, which I've gotten through this broker they tell me they will call me back and they never do. This place is very unreliable. I complained to them about them not calling me back, they told me they will call me in 15 minutes. I told them firmly if they don't call me in 30 minutes. I'm going to be very upset. Now I am writing this review and I will be contacting their corporate office.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Gabe is the MAN lol. I was referred to him from another insurance company due to my situation and he was so helpful. I told him from the beginning I like everything explained throughly and that's exactly what he did. He took his time with me so I understood all the different plans and what coverage I was getting. I asked probably a thousand question lol.Thank you so much for all your help GABE 2018<//text>< Rating>

Well here I am once more writing a review for Same Day Insurance I got my policy with them in June 2016 and they got me my insurance with Access and bad service I pay every month and every month I have to fax in the coverage letter to my finance company even though that I have called SameDay Insurance and Access about the issue over 4 times. And now my car was in an accident and the agent at Access has been clueless about what has been going on about my car repairs had been approved then stopped and once again supposedly they were going to start again and finally on Friday I called her again her response was what did I needed if repairs were going to be done on my car I asked her to please confirm and guess what her reaction was oh no it was marked as a total loss, really?? Im so upset with Access and SameDay insurance for getting me such a bad insurance company. Now I still have to wait for everything to be finalized.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Horrible service. Every time I call to see if I can get a lower rate for my insurance, they tell me they will call me back and they never do. This place is very unreliable. I complained to them about them not calling me back, they told me they will call me back.

I am very disappointed with this place mainly with Ingrid that gave me a price that Iiva to pay for insurance and when I got the bill I had increased $ 42 dollars more I called her and never knew that answer and only said that she would call me back and I never did it

< Review>
West Coast Funding provided an amazing Loan Officer, Cody Coleman. I was informed about the process during my journey to purchasing my first home. Cody was professional and extremely responsive with any concerns I had, he even went beyond to recommend best options. When it comes to buying a home in general there is enough stress, and I was blessed to have a great loan offer seeing my best interest. I strongly recommend not only using West Coast Funding, as well as reaching out to Cody to make your purchase journey effective and efficient.</Review>

Shane, Kaylah, and Kaylani are an AWESOME Team.  From my first sit down with Shane in late November, anything and everything was answered.. He explained how the process would go and it went exactly they way he stated.  Kaylah always cordial, great customer service and always entertained my calls. This team definitely made me feel confident that I was working with a great company. WCF definitely know this business and I will send all my family and friends to them.  It was a  pleasure working with them. Brand New home, thank you WCF!!!!

I just refinanced my home with Jeremiah Andujo and it could not have been easier. I didn’t leave the office and he scheduled the traveling notary to come to my house for me. It was a little too easy! He was very professional and was really quick to respond to me when I had questions. I would definitely ask for him if you're looking to refinance. 10/10< /Text>

Jeremiah Andujo is the man. He got me a great deal on the refinance and helped me understand the process. Most importantly he was available to answer any and all questions pertaining to the refinance and the market. He communicates on all platforms and checks up on his clients routinely throughout the process. I appreciate Jeremiah and West Coast Funding and would recommend them to anyone interested in refinancing.</text>

Recently refinanced my condo to take advantage of today's low rates. Jeremiah Andujo handled everything from start to finish. The entire process could not have been easier. Jeremiah was on top of every detail from the beginning and was always available. It was easy to see where wcf247 came from. Whether it was day, night, or weekend, Jeremiah always responded promptly. All paperwork was easily submitted through their website. A last minute change on my part was quickly handled. I came away feeling that the whole thing had been done with a trusted friend.</Text>

Considering I knew nothing about home loans he walked me through every step of the process, was very knowledgeable, and responsive.

I would 100% recommend my friends or family to work with Steven on their future home loans.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>West Coast Funding was a pleasure to do business with. They are knowledgeable, professional, efficient, courteous, and extremely personable. They walked us through our re-fi effortlessly. Working with our agent, Andre was like a dream come true. I recommend anyone looking for a lender with professionalism and ease, call Andre at West Coast Funding. You will be pleased as we are.<//review></record>

They were able to get us the best mortgage rate we have ever had. I love the support they give all their clients.

<text>I had the honor of working with Victor and Jeremiah at West Coast Funding who were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I contacted them initially knowing I wanted to purchase a home and within days provided me with a pre-approval letter and connected me with a very good real estate agent who found me a beautiful home. Within weeks I was a new home owner! Thanks again to Victor and Jeremiah for guiding me through the entire process start to finish and giving me a great loan with a great rate and making the process easy and stress free! Highly recommended!<//text>< UserId.>

We have recently completed a refinance through West Coast Funding taking only 14 days from our first contact with Casey Peek to signing the final documents with the notary.  We have refinanced many times over the years, and as I told Casey, this time was by far the easiest, most stress- free we've ever done.  We would not hesitate to recommend West Coast Funding and in particular, Casey, who was always quick to respond to my texts and phone calls, answering any questions or concerns I had.  We are very pleased with our new loan as we got a great rate!< /Text>

<review>Shane and Kaylah were great to work with. They were very professional and communicative throughout my refinancing experience. I was in the process of a IRRRL with a different lender who I thought were being straightforward, boy was I wrong. Shane and his crew saved me 15K! I’m glad I was referred to him before I closed. It gives me pleasure knowing there are businesses looking out for veterans!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>My husband and I bought our first home together in March with the help of Shane and Kaylah at West Coast Funding! Both of them were extremely helpful, especially when we were gathering all required documents. They were also very patient with me as I had a million questions about everything.

In November, Shane actually reached out to me regarding a refinance that will lower down our monthly payment and APR.  With literally almost no work on my end, we closed our refinance in December at 2.25%! I was so glad Shane reached out to me since I was actually receiving multiple letters regarding refinance. Aside from lower APR and lower monthly mortgage payment, we also skipped 1 month of pay (which was so nice during the holidays)!

I cannot stress enough how happy we were to have worked with Shane and Kaylah! Looking forward to working with them in the future, whether it be another refinance or to purchase another home!

My husband and I definitely recommend West Coast Funding!< /text></record>

I cannot thank Shane, Kaylah, and the rest of the West Coast Funding team enough for the outstanding job they did helping me buy my first home. True professionals. They were respectful and patience with my wife and I and they were always available to to ease our concerns and explained things in a manner that even I could understand. I had an extremely pleasurable and incredibly smooth experience buying our home. I would recommend West Coast Funding to anyone and do not know why someone would go elsewhere. They are the best! Thank You!<//text>

We are first time homeowners and were very apprehensive about the whole process.  You will have more confidence with Steven on your side.  He was readily available, even late at night, to answer questions.  We never felt pressured or looked down upon when we were unsure or needed to understand the financial obligations towards owning a home.  If you are really serious about buying a home, they will make the process simple and easy.  And most importantly they are very attentive and efficient when you want to close fast on your home.

We have been using West Coast Funding for the past 5 years and have never been disappointed.   They are extremely personable and very professional.  They made me feel like I was the only account they were working on.  From the top down, everyone cares about me  I could not ask for a better company to work with.  I highly recommend that you stop looking and just CALL TROY.  You will not be disappointed.<//Text>

This is a late review.  I looked into VA IRRRL rates around summer of 2020 and was referred to Troy and his team.  I began the VA Refi back in July of 2020 and completed the process in September 2020.  Troy and his team worked diligently to get the paperwork processed and we encountered delays due to things happening beyond our control.  Troy and his team took care of me and I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking to refinance their VA loans.  Prompt, professional and advised me every step of the way.</Text>

We have worked with West Coast Funding numerous times and they are literally the only company we will use. The team( Especially Tom!)  has always been quick to respond and answer any questions. They are sincere and ethical and have been a pleasure to work with. They get it done and work for you! We have a VA loan and they have proven time and time again to be knowledgeable and professional in all interactions. If you’re in the market for a new loan, a Refinance or anything else mortgage related you will not be disappointed!< /text>

Consummate professionals, Shane and Kaylah made the answer yes at each and every juncture applying their vast knowledge of the mortgage industry to make what had promised to be a complicated refi a transparent, drama-free transaction.  Beyond the technical aspects of the process, however, is their empathy, kindness and judgement free orientation - WCF can bring home the bacon and do it with heart!  Run don’t walk to WCF for your next mortgage transaction - you will be glad that you did!!<//text>

Shout out to Steven T. & Brian for taking care of us through the whole process. From checking our credit report to closing in our house, they kept it very professional, answered all our questions, stayed active communicating everything and keeping us posted. Couldn’t have asked for anyone better.

This being our first time buying a home, it was quite a fun experience!

My advice to first time buyers, it is a very competitive market here in California, so look very carefully in a timely manner. Focus more on your dislikes than your likes when looking for your future home.</Text>

We have  worked with Troy Moritz and West Coast funding for more than 7 years now. We have purchased two homes and refinanced both loans with West Coast Funding and have had an incredible experience every time. The level of customer service with every one we have dealt with has been incredible. Our loans are often complicated due to my husband being self employed and the team at West Coast Funding always works with us to find us the best rates and the best loans even though it would be easier to just give us whatever they could find. You will get nothing but outstanding customer service and personal attention with West Coast Funding, and I recommend them to family and friends with full confidence all the time.< /review>

Troy Moritz and his team were  professional, friendly and patient,  they were very good at keeping  us informed of the loan process.  We lived in Northern California and bought in San Diego.  Paperwork went flawless and very secure with our financial information.  I would not hesitate to hire his team again  to finance a house  or refi.  Thank you Troy and your great team!    🏚< /review>

“Was referred to Troy and West Coast Funding through a mutual friend.  Having refinanced many times with the same mortgage broker for the past 20 years, this was a new experience.  Very impressed with the whole process.  Both Troy and Stephanie are very responsive and very professional.  Everything went so smooth and we are happy with the entire experience.  We will definitely call Troy for our future needs as well.  Thanks guys!”

If you are looking for someone to not just help you with buying your home at a good rate but to help you enjoy your experience then look no further than Steven. Steven always made sure we understood everything that was going on, and if there was a way to make sure we got a better deal, then he was immediately on top of it. Furthermore, there were several times throughout the purchase of our new home were I had questions regarding numbers or policies that I just didn’t understand. I would just text or call Steven at ANY point/time throughout the day and he would ALWAYS answer and give me the appropriate response or answer. Rest assured, if we ever make another purchase I’ll ensure we contact Steven, he has my business from here on out.<//review>

Look no further with West Coast Funding!
We had the pleasure of working with Shane, Kaylah, and Rosie. Rest assured you’ll be in great hands! Their team is all very knowledgeable and prompt with any questions we had. My husband and I recently went through purchasing my parents’ house from them. We had some obstacles along the way due to COVID 19. Our situation of acquiring my parents house without paying for a real estate agent, and with one of my parents already out the country was a challenging, yet a successful accomplishment using the team at WCF. Not only were they easily accessible and transparent, but they walked us through the intricacies in getting the appropriate paperwork completed under a tight deadline. They gave us the best rate out of our list of referrals and yelp choices, and found an international notary based in the US that would notarize documents via webcam due to one of my parents stuck in a country with a closed US embassy. Shane and his team worked together seamlessly on both the buyer and seller side to get it done and Rosie went out of her way commuting to us to get documents signed for both parties! We can’t thank the team enough for all their hard work. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!< /Review>

As a real estate agent, I work with different lenders all the time. I have seen first hand how a lender can make or break a transaction. Troy, with West Coast Funding, is by far the best lender I have ever worked with both on the sellers side and buyers side of the transaction. He cares about each client and their best interest and consistently puts clients needs first.
I recommend Troy and West Coast Funding to my family, friends and all of my clients!<//review>

My husband and I had an incredible experience working with Joe Burns at West Coast Funding to get a mortgage for our new home. We were on a super tight timeline, and Joe worked with us around the clock to get a pre-approval within 48 hours, and then we closed within three weeks.

When we decided to refinance this year, we went back to Joe and had a seamless, easy experience. Highly recommend!</Review>

A+++++ Troy and his team (Stephanie) are amazing to work with!  I've been through the home mortgage financing process with West Coast Funding a couple of times and the service, support, efficiency, and communication are unmatched.  I have referred them to family and friends and they have all raved about how great of an experience they have add.  As always thanks for your help and for the amazing job you did!</Review>

Casey is the best out there! He first met with my wife and me to go over all the possible options and recommended what he thought was best for us. After my wife and I decided on an option, Casey kept in constant communication educating us on what to expect and what is best for us after hearing our needs.
I had some questions naturally when docs were being composed, and he took the time to walk me through the documents and answer all my questions no matter how trivial. I would definitely recommend Casey to anyone and going forward will only work with Casey and WCF. It also helps that he's a good golfer...<//text>

Definitely wouldn’t have made it through the whole process of buying a house without west cost funding and Mr Cody who was the one helping us and answering every question we had  even 5 times if necessary, on holidays and in the middle of the night from the start to the the end of the process and even after.

I was working with another lender who put an unreasonable cap on how much I could borrow and I would have never closed on my beautiful home without Shane’s help. He took me seriously as a borrower and was there every step of the way, alongside my realtor, helping me close on a home as quick as possible. He had the knowledge and patience necessary to answer all of my questions as a first time buyer, and helped to make the entire process smooth. Even after being in my home for a couple months, he still reaches out to ensure everything is well and keeps me informed on additional financial opportunities to take advantage of.  I highly recommend his services.< /Review>< pictures>

Over the years I have refinanced my home several times using the services of West Coast funding. Steven has been very professional, very diligent and understanding. There are some things that come up that always make my loan a challenge .  I receive so many offers to refinance my home in the mail and I would not use the services of any one else.   It’s  been a joy working with Stephen and all the people at West Coast funding.   I can count on Steven to let me know when rates have gone down enough that it’s beneficial for me to refinance.  I appreciate the team at West Coast.< /text>

<review>I couldn’t be more pleased with Troy and Stephanie’s work with my refinancing.  They accomplished everything I had hoped for; significant reduction in the monthly payment, a couple monthly payments I can use elsewhere, no out of pocket expenses at closing and paying off this supplemental tax bill I recently received. Thank you to everyone at West Coast Funding.

My family and I were stationed overseas, the time difference was a concern of ours when purchasing a home in San Diego. Shane, Stephanie, and the team at West Coast Funding alleviated all concerns. Shane and Stephanie were involved from start to finish an always kept us in the loop. They worked day and night with multiple agents to get us estimates for prospective homes along with any information we required.

The team was always responsive and worked diligently to get us a loan and home we were comfortable with. I do not believe we would have been able to purchase a home using any other lender!

Military/veteran friendly but best of all family friendly as they were intuitive and helpful to our families needs and wants. When there was an issue (with another party in the escrow process) Shane stepped in and gave us the peace of mind we needed. We will be using West Coast Funding again for any future home/real estate needs.<//Review>

I have had the best experience with financing  and re-financing VA home loan. Casey has gone above and beyond to help me and my family. He was even answering questions, while I was deployed to Afghanistan, that were outside financing a home. I would recommend WCF to anyone that is looking for home financing help. Make to have Casey and his team on your side. Thank you, Saul.<//review>

Our family has been using West Coast Funding for 11 years.  We have refinanced for lower payments 3 times.  Each time our experience has been positive.  They are courteous and professional.  Our first purchase was just as the market fell apart in 2008.  They worked some magic to get it done.  They answered all our questions, sometimes more than once.  I have recommended them to co workers and friends, and coworkers who are friends.  Everyone who talked to Troy and Brandon’s team said the competition could not come close to their rates.    We say no one comes close to their service or knowledge.<//Text>

<review>Troy and Tom at West Coast Funding are truly a class act.  They will certainly go the extra mile to ensure you get the best rate possible.  They are not in business just to make money, they strive to make a difference in your financial life.  Our loan was certainly not an easy loan given some unexpected obstacles along the way.  Tom and Troy made sure they considered every possibility to make our dream of buying the house of our dreams a reality.  Tom, the class act that he is, also gave us a house warming gift in spite of us insisting it was not really necessary.  Six months later when the rates dropped and it was time to re-finance we trusted our loan with Tom and Troy.  They did not disappoint; once again they came through with impeccable timing and got us a great rate and lower monthly mortgage.  Thanks Troy and Tom for your hard work and taking such good care of us.  If Troy tells you it can be done, you can rest assured he will do it and get you the best rate.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Troy / West Coast Funding is one of the best lending groups I have worked with. Their customer service is excellent, the rates are great, and their high level of ethics and transparency is refreshing in this industry.  I have completed multiple loans with West Coast Funding and they helped me finance, and refinance, my personal home. You will be very glad you worked with Troy and his team!<//Review><resp>None</resp>< user>

Casey broke down each step of our refi so it was super understandable and always responded to my questions quickly. He was able to call me outside of my 9-5 which other companies I contacted refused to. He realized I preferred texting as well which the bulk of our communication was through which made it even easier to move the process along.

We saved a ton of money going through West Coast Funding and I will only use/recomend them in the future.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969< /Gmap_id>< user_name>

Shane is simply the best there is. Period. He helped me secure my first home purchase last year and then helped me again this year with a refinance that significantly lowered my rate. He's incredibly transparent, attentive and always on your side. I would recommend him and his team to anyone looking to navigate the home purchase/refinance waters with complete confidence and trust.< /Text>

As a first time home buyer, I was very naive to all the paperwork that went into purchasing a home. Shane and Kaylah stayed on top of all of it, and were able to clearly explain anything I was having difficulty understanding. If you are looking for a VA Loan I highly recommend their services. Without them I am convinced it would have taken a much longer time to close on my house.< /text>

<Text>I just had the pleasure of working with Shane on a home closing last week. We faced quite a bit of challenges that were beyond his control, but he was very proactive with his communication and put his clients best interests at the forefront. I was the listing broker and he was doing the loan for the buyer (who were not my clients) but I felt compelled to write a review because my interaction with Shane was so positive. He does a great job for his clients and I hope to work with him again in the future.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Shane was spectacular. This is our second home purchase and a far better experience than our first. He took care of all the VA paperwork, and worked with them to secure my eligibility within a week of closing the sale of our other home. If you are considering a purchase, stop looking with Shane Stokes at West Coast Funding. All you will have to do is find your next home and wait for the closing date!< /Review>

I was a first-time home buyer and had a phenomenal experience with West Coast Funding.  I worked with Troy Moritz and Stephanie Garmo and both provided exceptional service throughout the process, making themselves available day and night to answer questions and to make sure the loan was ready well ahead of schedule.

I shopped around, and Go West Coast either beat or matched the rates of any lender that I found, offered (and delivered) a faster turnaround time and provided better overall service.  I highly recommend West Coast Funding, and plan to work with Troy and Stephanie again for future refinances and home purchases.

Edit:  As an update to my prior review, I just worked with Troy and Stephanie on a refinance, and received the same top-notch service that I experienced in connection with the original mortgage.  West Coast gave me an unbeatable deal on the refinance, and I couldn't be happier with the experience and the outcome.<//text>

As first time home buyers Casey and Troy put our minds at ease knowing we had a strong partner walking us through the lending process.  Their level of communication was above and beyond what we could have expected or hoped - they were highly responsive and proactive in reaching out.  Both were very professional, timely, and understanding, even when we asked the same questions a few times.

We already have recommended them to friends and family, will continue to do so in the future, and will leverage their services again when we buy our next home.</Text>

<text>We recently purchased our first home, and when we finally chose a lender, Steven Tavera and his team handle our transaction. Purchasing a home  can be a nightmare, especially when there are several moving components and people involved. This transaction though, was very smooth from the beginning, thanks to Steven. He ensured we were on track every step of the way. Steven possesses a quality rarely found in today's lending agents--he returns calls and emails promptly. His work for us was punctual, professional, and I would highly recommend Steven and his company to anyone looking for a hassle-free mortgage loan. Thanks, Steven Tavera!< /text>< Pictures>

Troy and Stephanie were fantastic handling the recent refinance of my home. They were prompt friendly and efficient. They answered all my questions and were available whenever I needed them. They even helped me out on my Home Equity Line of Credit after the refinance was complete. Not to mention they saved me hundreds of dollars a month by locking in a great interest rate and getting rid of my PMI. Thank you Troy, Stephanie and all of those at West Coast Funding. They are true professionals and made the process easy and painless. Check them out if you want to save money and have a phenomenal experience!</review>

Casey did an awesome job handling our recent refi when we moved from a 30yr to a 15yr. He locked in a great rate and made the process a piece of cake from start to finish. He was proactive, transparent, and responsive, and despite the refi occurring in the midst of a pandemic he made it go as smooth as it could. I highly recommend West Coast Funding, and thanks to them we never have to worry about another refi again.<//review>

Shane was great to work with. As first time home buyers, he made the process easier for us. He was professional and didn’t hesitate to contact us to give updates. I greatly appreciated his open communication and willingness to explain things. We had lots of questions about the lending process and he (and Stephanie) never made us feel like an inconvenience. We have already recommended WCF to friends because of the positive experience we had with Shane. Thank you!< /text>

Both men were really welcoming and very happy to guide me through the process. I am a first time home buyer and was really overwhelmed by the process. Casey was more than available to help. What I mean is that he was available at anytime through texts, emails, and calls. I was well taken care of by Casey. He answered all my questions and kept me updated through this grueling process. I could not have gone through this without Casey. I highly recommend this company because of their superb professionalism and great accessibility.

Working with Shane, from West Coast Funding, was a great experience! He ensured we understood and were comfortable with each and every step of the process. As first time home buyers we had our worries and doubts, but Shane provided us with a stress free, fast tracked, easy and enjoyable home buying experience!! 100% recommend using West Coast Funding, and make sure you ask for Shane Stokes!<//text>

<Text>We were skeptical to try again but Shane and Kaylah at West Coast Funding did a great job helping us get our house.  This was my wife and I’s fourth time trying to buy a home and for some reason or another they fell through with other lenders. From day one Shame and Kaylah kept up great communication with us and helped us close our home in just 22 days!  Everything was hassle and stress free and they reassured us along the way that everything was processing as it should.  They at West Coast Funding have a GREAT team there and I highly recommend them!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969<//Gmap_id>< pictures>

Shane and Kaylah were great throughout the entire home buying process. As first time home buyers my husband and I were nervous about going through the process but they both were very helpful and answered any questions we had and gave us all the information we needed. Very quick responses and always had our best interest in mind. They made it a smooth process for us and we are so glad we decided to do business with them. Thank you so much Shane & Kaylah!</text>

They got us an amazing rate,  were incredibly responsive (near instantaneous) and had great attention to detail. There are a lot of moving pieces for a mortgage and there was not a single error on any document they handled, which is extremely rare for the lending business. So thankful we worked with them!<//text>< resp>

<text>Couple of weeks ago I purchased a condo house , I hired West Coast Funding Team .Chuck ,Maricruz , Griselda team .It was a quick Smooth process and pleasant experience dealing with the whole Team . I learned that big names on Real State don’t mean much for the most part they see us customers as numbers as well as their only personal business. I sure highly recommend West Coast Funding . Special thanks to Mr. Chuck Maricruz and Griselda. And team .keep up the good work .< /text>< Pics>

Shane at WCF is about as good as they come. He is extremely knowledgeable and works hard for his client. Shane helped me purchase the home of my dreams this summer and I surely couldn't have done it without him. He was professional, courteous, and speedy when I needed him to be. I would highly recommend the WCF team to anyone looking to buy or sell real estate! Thanks man.< /review>

Thanks to Shane and Kaylah they made it possible for us to be able to purchase a home in a short amount of time. They made things quick and simple, and always answered our questions. 10/10 would recommend Shane and Kaylah<//Review>

I was already cornered by a ridiculous FHA loan offer when I reached out to Chuck about VA loan.  Long story short, Chuck's email reaching out to veterans about VA loan worked like a charm. Next thing you know Maricruz was all over paperwork and boom! . . CLOSED in less than 15days. Superb team!  Btw, check out Chuck's VA educational segments in YouTube.  Thank you Chuck, Maricruz and the WCF 24/7 team.<//Review>

Troy and Casey were able to find the best possible loan for us.  Their customer service was incredible, and they were there for us 24/7 whenever we had any questions or concerns.  They were very honest from the beginning, and they came through for us in a big way.  Even after we closed, they were still in contact with us making sure everything was okay.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience, and we highly recommend Troy and Casey!!</Text>

No matter what time or day he was always there to answer our call about any questions we had. He's very professional, trustworthy, and knowledgeable. He goes above and beyond with helping us even when escrow is over. We will continue to work with him in the future with refinances or buying another home. I highly recommend anybody that is either in the market or interested in home buying to contact Shane!<//Text></record>

Troy has class and skill.  He's incredibly knowledgeable, honest, trustworthy, flexible when necessary, and he knows how to get a deal done.  Your bottom line is his priority, he works to understand and achieve what will be best for you, and he won't try to sell or pitch you.  He's also just a really cool guy.

We were first time home buyers.  Troy was patient, we always knew what to expect, and he and his office (thank you, Tom!) were consistent and responsive.  Troy gained the respect and admiration of our agent, the escrow agent, - and the listing agent.  Because of Troy and Tom, we overcame the sellers' concerns and we even closed early.  We'll never work with anyone else.</Review>

I had the best experience with Chuck and Maricruz at West Coast. When Chuck told me he could help us refinance and get it closed in a short period of time, I was very skeptical and I told him that. Our situation was not cut and dry and required more work then normal but Chuck delivered just like he said he would! Maricruz processed everything for us like a pro. She even went out of her way to contact our appraiser when there was a discrepancy. Both of them answered every phone call and email within minutes. I was never in the dark about where we were in the process. It could not have been any easier and I will definitely be back for future needs. Thanks again Chuck and Maricruz!< /Text>

My wife and I recently purchased our first home here in Oceanside, CA and we used West Coast Funding as our lender. We utilized the VA loan to purchase our home and West Coast Funding is very knowledgeable on that process. Shane Stokes and his assistant Kaylah Miller went above and beyond to ensure we not only got the best rate, but to educate us every step of the way. Buying a home and can be a scary process but I felt like we were in such good hands on the lender side that it helped alleviate the majority of our stress. No matter what type of loan you are seeking I would definitely recommend West Coast Funding. Especially Shane Stokes and Kaylah Miller! They're awesome!<//text>

<Review>We worked closely with Brandon and Rachel to get a home in Colorado. The market here is no joke and Brandon, Rachel, and West Coast Funding were the difference maker in landing a house with close to 20 offers on it! We weren't even the highest offer, but the speed at which West Coast could close as well as the buttoned-up presentation of the offer pushed us to the top of the heap. I was astounded by their work ethic. These guys are literally available 24/7 and bulldogged our deal from the beginning through the finish line. I did my due diligence and had a couple other lenders on the line, but no one could match the speed and availability of West Cost Funding. Thank you guys!< /Review><response>None</response>< date>

This was our very first time to purchase a house.Rachel was there every step of the way. We were inexperienced and a bit confused about the whole process. Rachel would explain what every term meant and how it played out through the process. She made us feel very secure with our purchase price and assured us that we were in good hands. Their company truly knows the meaning of teamwork. They worked fast and very smart on the details. I have recommended her to family and friends already. We are very happy with our purchase and want everyone to experience her professional expertise in the real estate world. Thank you for the TLC. You've made buying a house so simple. Our family can't say how grateful we are to you and the team at west coast funding. Thank You❤️<//text>

Seriously have to say the best experience I have had while owning my home. Shane made it easy and I swear this dude never sleeps. I never met him in person but he has become family. What he said he could do, he did!. If you are looking for a smooth transaction from a trustworthy source, Shane is your guy. I wish I could give him and his assistant a million stars. He followed up with me as he said , even 6 months later!  He will get all my future business and I recommend him to all my friends!</Review>

<Text>Troy and team work magic. We refi'd our home and the good folks at West Coast Funding made it a breeze.

Responses to any of my questions (I'm a noob, so there were many), were answered clearly and concisely, and always in a very timely manner.

The process was seriously quick and painless, upload some docs to a portal and they go to work

WCF came highly recommended by 2 different acquaintances, and I'm happy to join the group of satisfied folks online, and socially, in recommending them to anyone looking to buy or refinance a property :)<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Brandon and Rachel are absolutely outstanding. They were able to complete a refinance and a purchase for the same client within 30 days.  Any time, day or night, they were always available! Their work ethic is truly incredible. They made the entire process, for both the refi and purchase, so easy and smooth for my client. My client could not stop raving about Brandon and Rachel. Will definitely use West Coast Funding again.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

A month ago, we began working with Shane at West Coast Funding and in under 21 days we closed escrow on our very first home. I can’t say enough great things about Shane! He worked around the clock to make this experience seamless, get us the best rate, and took the extra time to educate us with this new and what initially seemed like an intimidating process. His professionalism, response time to texts, emails, and open communication was extremely appreciated. He cared for us and invested himself into getting this home as much as we did.  I felt reassured the entire time and confident knowing that Shane was handling everything. We will definitely be referring West Coast Funding and Shane to all of our friends and family looking to get a loan.</text>

I'm a single female, in the military, who was able to purchase a duplex in downtown area. Typically unusual, but his team performed so well, I'm honestly not even sure how they managed to help me close on this house. They made my first home buying experience so easy, I was shocked myself, the process was so easy, I started to get nervous, I had expected a more dreading process... I had hiccups along the way but he always assured me it's something he can make happen. We were actually able to close earlier than expected dates(less than 30 days), they were working weekends and holidays with me just to make my first home purchase happen. They were very easy to talk to, always available and to what I think, gave me the best deal. They werent scared of my situation and took a strong approach, with confidence to close the deal. As a member of the military, they were very knowledgeable about handling VA loans and I have always recommended them to my peers!

Talk about getting down to business.  Knowledge is power.  They have the knowledge.  Let's just say the refinance had some complications.  A very skilled group of people maneuvered the process quickly and professionally.  They satisfied all outside parties quickly and got the loan through.

Great rates, quick response, I am glad they are on my side.

Thank you,< /Review>

George Magana was our broker on the sale of a house in Camarillo, and we could not have had better results than what we had.  George was amazing at keeping us informed on what was going on the entire time.  We believe he went the extra mile many times.  We live in Idaho, and he went to the court house to pick up papers we needed, and even went to the house and added the earthquake belt around the hot water tank....yes, above and beyond what was expected.  We were blessed to have him as our broker, and would highly recommend him to everyone.<//text>

Troy's expertise in this field, made my refinancing process seamless.  Troy was able to explain my HUD in detail from top to bottom, giving me a clear understanding of where my fees were going, and how they were applied, along with where my credits were coming from, a true professional nonetheless.

From the very beginning Troy was on-point.  My refinancing was pretty complex based on a lot of surprises that came up, in which I needed to clear up, and Troy was very patient, and stayed the course and educated me in every way possible to make my refinance possible.

At the end of the day, Troy is one of the only individuals I would trust w/any of my real estate financial needs, we even discussed future ways to get a better rate down the road, I really appreciate his proactive approach to ensuring I have the best loan possible!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>I executed a VA remortgage with cash out through West Coast Funding working with Shane Stokes and Stepanie Garmo. Shane worked with me for a couple of months to aid my decision in the right product and timing, and then both Shane and Stephanie helped me navigate the process including working odd hours and continuing to process the loan while work took me to Australia , working off hours to correspond with me and help line up and rectify issues with the home survey and other issues. Everything was resolved smoothly, the loan closed with a good provider and I cannot say enough good things about this team. Their care and support for me throughout the process was exemplary, well above my expectations. Thank you both.<//Text>< time>

<Review>Brandon is awesome! This is the third time I have refinanced through West Coast Funding. When interest rates dropped to a point where it was beneficial for me to refinance, Brandon contacted me immediately. They made the process so stress free and easy. I would recommend everyone to use West Coast Funding. Many thanks!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My wife and I were in escrow on an investment property in North Park and met Shane Stokes, at a nearby open house. We already had financing in place and were interested mostly in looking at décor for ideas on our own rehab. Shane immediately caught my attention because of his knowledge and professionalism. After our chance encounter, Shane reached out to me regarding the terms of our existing financing and assured me his firm could do better. I already had firm financing terms from 3 other firms and was satisfied with my options, but figured I would hear him out. I filled out the required paperwork and finalized critical details with the Loan Consultant, Brandon Martinez. The process was easy and painless. The founder, Troy Moritz, then gave me a call to iron out the details. Troy is exceptional and it is no surprise that he is as successful as he is. He cared genuinely about my current situation and my long-term goals. It should be known that my wife and I invest heavily in real estate as our retirement strategy and we have very specific goals in mind. We were not looking to save a few basis points on our interest rate. We were looking to build a relationship with a lender that could build a financing structure that could be repeated for numerous real estate transactions in the next 5 years and Troy offered just that. Not only could he beat the best financing arrangements I could find, but he did so with an incredible team that was second to none. Once we secured financing, the rest was history. Rachel Gonzalez brought it all together streamlining the mounds of paperwork, salary verification, etc. She was extremely responsive and knew exactly what she needed from us.  As the last days of escrow approached, the team worked smoothly to ensure our needs were met. It is worth mentioning that the seller was extremely difficult to work with and tried multiple tactics to delay the close of escrow. The West Coast Funding team worked all hours to ensure all last-minute questions, delays, and controversies were resolved with our best interest in mind.  The entire experience went above and beyond my expectations and I would recommend the firm to my friends and families for all their funding needs. I look forward to the next opportunity we have to work with the West Coast Funding team.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Troy and West Coast Funding went above and beyond my greatest expectations in securing a house refinancing loan.  I had experienced difficulties with another lender and it seemed that the issues involved in my case were absolutely handled with the greatest speed and most beneficial outcome that I possibly could have expected.  I know the issues were complicated but in all my dealings with Troy, I never experienced a negative word or feeling.  He was extremely knowledgeable, professional, efficient, and positive in every respect, and I would highly recommend him and his company to anyone looking for the best finance company in California, bar none!  Thank you, Troy, and West Coast Funding very much for a job superbly done!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Jordan V. was more patient  and understanding, I wanted to refi my first and second loans into one 30 yr. fix, And he made it happen, we nearly lost our home not once but twice in the last 12 years we been in it, do to the economy, we somehow managed to survive. I was very skeptical and I can not tell you the concerns I had with just choosing any lender. Jordan answered the tough questions, the obvious questions, and probably a few silly questions, in other words he made me feel comfortable in everything we were doing. 30yr fix at 3.75%, it took some time, but we finally closed, and even got a little cash back. Great Job!!</Review>< Pics>

<text>I’m a Veteran and needed someone to help me and my wife finance a loan on a new construction home through the VA. We found George Magana and he did an awesome job of guiding us through the loan process. Linda and I can’t thank George enough for making us feel comfortable and confident through the confusing ordeal. We are indebted to him and we owe him a lot of gratitude. He was very thorough and professional in explaining everything expertly through our loan process. He responded quickly to our questions and was extremely helpful and patient in explaining every step in detail to us. He is a personable and compassionate friend and is a great pleasure to work with.

< Review>
Worked primarily with Troy and Rachel.  They came recommended by our realtor and had a good working relationship.  Wrote a custom pre-approval for each offer we made(two separate properties) and had great turnaround time for any questions asked/information I needed.   We did our rate shopping after we got started with Troy, we did find a better rate from another company.  I presented it to Troy and he matched the rate as well as the lender fee, then beat the fee by twenty bucks.  Definitely made me happy as I would much prefer to work with someone I can call/text/meet in person over the internet only company I got the other rate from.  During the loan process, I was kept up to date during every step along the way.  Each time they did something or needed something, I would get notification and send back required documents.  We had a 21 day escrow and were able to close on time.  Highly recommend, even if you find a better rate, give it to Troy and he'll match it.  Pleasure to work with.< /Review>

A whole lot. I give praise to Shane Stokes and his entire team.  I am so skeptical of lenders after all this is my home. I was referred to Shane by one of my colleagues and I said okay fine I'll try him.  I was working closely with two other lenders but I felt uncomfortable with them. Then I met Shane. And oh my goodness what a difference a conversation makes. This young man worked with me, the turnover was quickly done, and absolutely professional. He's also very comical easy to talk to which meant a lot for them to me. He made me feel at ease with the entire process. At the end of the day I was able to pay off several liens that was on my property; the HERO lien, switched over to an excellent Mortgage Company, and put a little change in my pocket. The team that he works with, are so fast and so easy to talk to. I felt so it he's dealing with this entire process which only took really and less than a month.  Shane not only held my hand through this entire process, he educated me on different areas, and even does follow-ups after the loan has closed. He's like a big brother. Yeah a big brother. Shane and his team are awesome, you will not regret working with this young man and his leadership team. They're the best. Thank you so much for everything that you have done for me and my family.<//text>< resp>

He is the best and easy to work with and the whole process takes no time at all.That's because he knows what he is doing and works with you all the way.

Had the pleasure of being referred about 18 months ago where he saved me from a terrible refi offer.  Quickly he got me a better offer and reduced my payment significantly.

Working with Shane Stokes (and his team) was the best broker experience I've had yet!  This was my 2nd home purchase but I've worked with a few brokers in the past and Shane exceeding my expectations by far!  His style matched mine perfectly- he's straight and to the point, explains things well, is courteous of my schedule and helped me work through busy days very easily (via quick calls, texts, emails), etc.  He had the same sense of urgency I work under and expect of my partners; he shopped for a better deal for me (even after first deal was approved) and never let off the gas.  He even went above & beyond at times- when the seller's agent was slow to react or not very cooperative, he made phone calls to assist in the process.  He even offered to help us rent a U-HAUL and load up personal belongings that we felt the seller was going to leave behind (so we didn't move into a new house with a bunch of junk leftover).  Though that was not needed in the end, it showed us how willing Shane was to make our experience the smoothest possible (outside of his "requirements" as just our broker).  I will definitely refer Shane to all of my friends & family, work my re-finance options with him, and look forward to working with Shane on my future loans/purchases!  A++<//review>

<review>Refinancing at a lower rate was a breeze with West Coast Funding. West Coast funding is really customer focused. Its not the first time that I have dealt with them and they surely can be trusted, I got my own experience on that matter.</review><Name>Philippe Thouin</Name></record></dataset><record>

In the fall of 2011 our prospects of securing a home purchase seemed bleak.  No financial institution was willing to work with us.  We turned to West Coast Funding as our last resort and we could not have been happier.  They made our dream of home ownership become a reality.  Since then we have done multiple transactions with them and their services have been unmatched.  Brandon is very easy to work with and his deep knowledge of the business makes it easy to complete the tedious loan process.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>From my first contact with West Coast Funding, was beyond impressed by Brandon Martinez and the phenomenal team (Vito Russo and Troy Moritz).They solved every puzzle our rather complicated financing scenario demanded!

They hit it out of the park for us and, from all the the glowing reviews you will read, for EVERY ONE of their clients.

There are those that make it happen, wait for it to happen, or wonder why it happened. Brandon, Vito, Troy and WCF just MAKE IT HAPPEN.

I'm an unabashed fan!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969< /Gmap_id></record>

West Coast Funding, led by Troy Moritz is an outstanding company.  I recommend them to anyone looking for a new mortgage, or as i was, looking to refi.  Troy and his team worked with me, patiently and with great attitude, through an extremely difficult set of circumstances.  Thanks Troy and Team.  They got it done for me.  I'm a very satisfied customer.<//review>

I looked over two months to find someone to refinance our house so that we could put a new roof on.  Just a word to the wise if you need a new roof most lenders will not refinance you because you do not have a good roof you have to have a good to refinance. Yeah it is a catch 22. Teena Broumand was willing to put the money in an escrow account something ever other loan officer I talked to did not even mention. Teena Broumand is a professional in every sense of the word.  She is extremely personable, asks the right questions, possesses an expert knowledge of the lending process. She had the lending institution’s representative come to our house when we executed the loan.

We have not only obtained a loan that meets our financial needs, more importantly, we have made a friend. I have no qualms referring people to Teena, and will continue to do so.  If we had a need for another loan, we would not hesitate to contact Teena</Text>

<review>This has been the worst loan process I have ever been in. It is hard enough to get the paperwork once but with them I had to get it several times because they said they never got it. After the 4 th month we did some research on them and found out there loan processor is not licensed. No background check and she (Lisa) had all of my information including bank records, all of my account numbers, and social security numbers. I have spoke with the dept. of R.E. and they indicated they may be committing fraud. I am a Veteren and I think I deserve better than this so I went to a legitimate company with honest people.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffbccba14265:0x1aa60f5c5a4f5969<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Troy has refinanced us 3 times in the last 18 months. Every time rates go down I call him and he's more than happy to help me get the ball rolling same day! He makes the process so easy. I don't know if I'm supposed to say this but it never costs me a dime. If I was paying a fee to do this every time like in the old days, I'd think twice, but at the end of the day if I can lower my payment for free, I'd be stupid not to do it. You're nuts if you're going with somebody else.

PS... I even let him refi my mother and she's been back to him with both of her properties twice now. She's a big fan too which is really saying something!< /Text>< Pics>

The process was handled with high professionalism and responsibility. All requests were completed in a timely fashion and Troy Moritz provided an outstanding service. We're extremely happy and sincerely recommend the company to anyone who needs financing or other real estate services.

<Review>I purchased my house using West Coast Funding.  After an exhausting search I determined that West Coast had the absolute best rate for my situation and Troy's team was the most upfront and honest of the companies I dealt with.  Everything went really smoothly and my home was purchased with ease.  I also refinanced with West Coast Funding when rated dipped lower, which was just as smooth as our first transaction.  I have sent multiple friends to West Coast Funding for new home purchases and re-fis and everyone of them has been so impressed that they've sent referrals to WCF.  I would highly recommend WCF to anyone looking to purchase a home in California.</Review>< resp>

We knew about "George Magana" of West Coast Funding through my brother who had an amazing experience working with him in mortgage refinancing in a timely and efficient manner. We have expressed our frustration dealing with various lenders for refinancing to my brother and he then referred us to George in mid November 2016. We decided to reach out to George and he's absolutely phenomenal! We explained our scenarios to him and he gave us several different options and helped us figure out one that will work best for us.
We have just finished our refinancing with George Magana of West Coast Funding and it was a great process from start to finish. We
were contacted by multiple lenders and no one was as knowledgeable, respectful and responsive than "George Magana". He answers all our questions thoroughly and made a usually stressful process very smooth and stress-free. He's all upfront, very clear and extremely efficient. He's very thoughtful and really made us feel supported and ensure that we understood and knew our options.
Overall, amazing experience and will continue to use them for our mortgage needs and will highly recommend "George Magana" to our family and friends.</review>

Glad to see you an independently owned business surviving in the middle of two franchises after all this time under different management. They offer a variety of menu items that you wouldn't normally find at the other franchise joints anyway kudos to y'all<//Review>

Always enjoyed the food here growing up in Oakland. This is a great place to get a great local burger, especially when you are tired of the food chains around here.< /review>

This Burger Joint Fell off the Game In Taste!  The Burgers taste Like Tortas Now! And the Hot Dogs and Corn dogs Ain't The Same No more. The Only thing That's the actual Same are the French Fries.  Other than that the Chefs need to Step they Game up. One more Burger Joint that Bites the Dust!<//review>

I wouldn't have given this place one-star review but after paying $23 for two sandwiches I'm getting my order wrong not fixing it refunding me only $11 and I got to eat half of a sandwich. To worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Maybe it was just me but if I treated my customers this way I wouldn't have a business anymore.< /text>

I found this place when I went back to visit my hometown, Oakland. Chubby Freeze was right across the street from my hotel. The food was good and fast. Something different from the regular fast food places in the area.< /Text>

Maybe I made a mistake by not getting a burger like past reviewers but I wanted to be different so instead I got a Fish Burger. It was basically like 3 fish sticks fried with tartar sauce and shredded lettuce. No flavor at all! For almost $7 for the sandwich alone i would rather have gotten 2 or 3 Filet-O-Fish sandwiches from McDonald's seriously! I will come back because I want to try a burger next time as well as a shake. Place was rather small but clean and the young lady that took my order was very polite! Hopefully a burger can encourage me to give them more stars next time! They accept debit, they have outdoor seating and even a order window outside if dont want to order inside.</Review>

< Review>
Delicious Burgers!! I always request the fries "extra crispy" and they are so good. Lots of different flavored shakes, even pineapple! They offer different burgers but mine is the original chubby burger.
You can also call ahead if its to go. Same cook for years, great place to eat!<//Review>

The dining room was closed so we had to order through window outside. I ordered the caramel shake, this was new to me. I love it. This place has always delivered for me.< /review>

Just ok.  A combo meal is going to cost you over 11 dollars.  With Burger King and McDonald's beside it I'd choose them.</text>

Clean for the most part, decent customer service . Old school, no frills but decent burgers, crinkle fries, and milkshakes. No toilet paper or paper towels in bathroom.... Yucko! Owners c'mon.... paint over the graffiti, and stock the restroom. Good prices!<//Text>

Interesting service, took them almost 15 minutes to open up their slide in door and take my order. It was like I was literally invisible to them. Great food but least AKNOWLEDGE the customers presence and let them know that you're busy.< /text>

One of my favorite places in Oakland for a burger, fries, and a shake or freeze.  It is hard to find a place that knows how to do a freeze, and does it well.  Price is decent and it is a great value.  Food is delucious!< /review>

It was really good, a little n pricy but worth it you can see them cook your food as you watch fresh grilled burger and bacon and they sure don't skimp you in the fries< /Review>

This Restaurant ain't what it used to be! The Burgers are paper thin, the fries are drenched in oil & sawggie! Even the Milk shakes arnt the Same anymore. These new Cooks They Got in there have no experience or Seasoning.< /review>

<Review>I was very sad to leave my old Extra Space Storage facility on Meeker Ave in Richmond CA because Chris and Andre was so wonderful and kept the place immaculate.  When I need to return to renting storage space, they did not have a space the size I needed when I needed it so I went shopping.  I was able to stay with Extra Space Storage at a good price and was pleasantly surprised to find great service and a warm welcome from Monica.  The facility is also clean and feels safe.  As they say, all is well that ends well,.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I have had a few interactions with Lisa and she is very personable, very helpful, and knows her job well. She runs a very clean and organized facility. I give 5 stars plus to her and this facility. I would definitely recommend this facility to people. The entire process is simple in office or online. Very satisfied with the service and experience here. Thanks Lisa.</text>

<Text>Lesea was so incredibly helpful and accommodating when it came to trying to get my trailer in the unit.  She went above and beyond and was extremely communicative throughout the entire process.  I was able to finally get my trailer in the unit and couldn't be more happy!  Thanks Lesea!!< /Text>< name>

Let me tell you something dope about this spot. Not only are the staff super friendly and amazing ( Lisa ). The owner is absolutely wonderful and takes time to make you feel super at home so thank you Lisa.

Upon arrival we had the BLESSING of meeting ANDRE. He gave us an amazing tour of the extra CLEAN facility. We had an amazing time chatting about the Bay Area and if you are looking for a car lesson this guy is for you. Andre made this transaction 100 percent amazing and easy. Dudes got the illest personality. I’d work with this man any day of the week.

Definitely would love to recommend this place for sure. Easiest and most AFFORDABLE STORAGE spot for sure. Cheapest and best storage unit in the neighborhood for sure.< /Review>

Unexpected circumstances forced us to find a storage unit quickly that was nice, clean, safe and affordable. Extra Space Storage was all that and more. I had read the  RAVE reviews about Lisa - who manages the place at 3500 San Pablo Dam - and chose based on that. And when we arrived, Lisa even exceeded those expectations. She helped us chose the right unit and executed everything quickly and competently. Most importantly, she was just so kind and nice. These things are important to me. We've been putting things in our new unit a few times now and the easy access by code is great. The freight elevator is a breeze and the place is carpeted, well lit, clean and just perfect. I cannot recommend this place enough.< /Text>

If you need a storage unit I highly recommend Extra Space Storage. This is a very clean facility that provides excellent customer service. I was renting a storage unit yesterday evening and was having trouble with signing the lease electronically on my phone it was close to closing and traffic was bad getting to Elsobrante but Monica was kind enough to stay til I arrived. She had everything ready for me to sign showed me around the facility and my storage unit. It was quick and hassle free. Thank you Monica for all your help. I will definitely recommend Extra Space Storage to my family and friends.</Review>

Who knew renting a storage unit could be so unpleasant? Avoid at all costs. The management is awful. the only lift is often broken. The Rooms are all janky and not secure. Definitely found evidence of rats and saw some mold. The halls are constantly littered with trash.

oh yeah... it’s also heinously expensive< /Review>

<Text>Both staff were really nice on the phone and on site. The process to have the storage, the key, the access, was fast and smooth.

Lesea the store manager was super friendly and helpful when signing me up and the storage units are well maintained and clean.  If you compare prices with other storage places esp. as you get closer to Berkeley you will see this place has great deals per square foot. Close to I-80 so easy to get to.< /review>

This actual location is so amazing, very friendly, and very accommodating. I can honestly say that Extra Space Storage hired one of the best manager property at this location. I love the fact that she is very clear of the whole process, and communicates very well which is key in these days and for whatever the reason it may be if one is having any difficulties she can brighten one's day.  Thank you.</text>

<review>I needed a storage because I decided to move to a studio (went cheaper to pay all my deft off). When I got to Extra Space, I was in a stressed snappy mood. I snapped at the manager Lisa which was totally unwarranted. Lisa is so professional and nice. She talked me right out of my mood and took time with me to help me figure out what storage would work best for my belongings. Lisa is a great representation for ES. While I was there, a few people can in for various reasons and she treated everyone the same. ***On a side note, why was that crazy man on here talking trash about her. That sh*t is ridiculous. I bet he himself is an abuser***.<//review><GmapID>0x8085778566f36f53:0x7b59c070ba6d0527</GmapID><name>JulieAnna Muniz< /name><Time>1562535187077< /Time>< rate>

<username>Ernesto Lopez<//username><Time>1534882377043</Time><rating>2</rating><Text>Update: After just a couple months, the dues for my monthly cost for my storage increased to the point of not saving me any money consolidating my other two storage units into this one.

ORIGINAL: Loved my experience here! Lesea(manager) was super friendly and helpful! Answered all my question and gave the perfect amount of information.

Loved her patience, witnessed new space tenant asking the most... *not so smart* question. She handled it perfectly!

I am relocating my belonging from other locations to this one which is a great deal and better price. Easy access and great space for moving, loading and unloading. The space is super clean and the location is perfect and easy access to the freeway! Thank you guys, give this woman a bonus. All that without a single sip of coffee yet.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I have never in my life had such a easy fast and patient person help me in renting a storage unit. Juanita is so personable and genuinely pleasant no question was too much and after five of my calls I expected to wear on her nerves.. But no. She is wonderful to do business with. Thanks extra space storage!</Text>< user_name>

I stopped by recently to check out some units. I’m currently moving and I was in a frenzy trying to find a secured location. I was greeted by one of the most outstanding customer service associates that I ever came across, Ms Juanita! She seen I was in a panic and assured me that I came to the right place. She answered all of my questions as though she started the company her self! I highly recommend everyone to take their business there. You will not be disappointed! I was very impressed with how clean the site was! Definetly a 5 star storage company!<//Review>

Facility:  Clean, gate with code, no elevator for people but a lift for items going to 2nd floor, clean restroom available, access is from a busy street with a dip before driveway.  However there is a center turning lane so you won't be in traffic.  Low profile vehicles may and do scrape the street when exiting and entering the facility too quickly .  VERY CLEAN FACILITY.

Staff:  Friendly and very helpful. They take the time to answer your questions.  They do their best to meet your needs.</review>

<Time>1560735115286<//Time><text>I regret renting here! Lisa is the worst representative ever! I began renting early May with intention of only renting 2 months which I paid in advance.
I spoke with Lisa at the office twice informing her I would be arriving with a 20 foot U-Haul when I moved out instead of 15 trips with my truck when I moved in. Lisa agreed to move her car when I moved out as her vehicle blocks paying customers. Lisa informed me during our discussion that she is a physically abused woman with anger issues with history of being choked by someone and has recently been threatened by renting tenants at X-Tra Space Storage. On 6/12/19, I left voice mail at X-tra Storage office confirming I would be arriving to move out the next Saturday morning approximately 11 AM with a 20 foot U-Haul. I arrived approximately 11 AM as notified. Lisa was alone in the office and I went in to politely greet her. Lisa’s demeanor was cold and flippant,”May I help you.” After several previous face to face discussions, and that she was the live in property manager there for years,
I was shocked she played the ‘I have no idea who you are’ card. Courteously, I replied who i was and that arrived to move. “I didn’t know you were coming so soon,” Lisa snapped back a reply with hatred in her eyes and with tensed facial features. “Just go drive in!!!!”
After slowly driving the U-Haul truck through the front gate and around the building, I asked my wife to video our moving experience because we were moving away after living in the area since 1988. However, Lisa was driving out after my turn around the first building. My wife videoed Lisa in a fit of rage hollering at us from behind her car steering wheel and gesturing her hands violently at us. I am grateful I no longer will need to interact with property manager Lisa. My next negative experience will be recorded and police will be notified. Fair Warning. Lisa is the personification of unprofessionalism with a lack of common courtesy and self control. Whatever is bothering Lisa she needs professional help before she offends more customers. If needed, I will provide the video of Lisa in a fit of rage hollering at us while she was driving her vehicle which may be recorded on the premises camera as well. Don’t rent here. AVOID LISA. AVOID X-Tra Space Storage on San Pablo Dam Road in El Sobrante.
Or, she is a walking short fuse waiting to explode daily.<//text><userid>111351662245232221773< /userid><rating>1</rating>< Name>

<text>First thing is first. If you're in the area and need a place to store your stuff, come here first.

I lost my father and had very little time to move his belongs, including his classic car that didn't have an engine in it. I did really have time to plan anything and was super overwhelmed.

Lesea went above and beyond to help me not only get a spot for my dad's car but a spot that made the whole process so much easier. She set up a meeting with me to show me the spot, quickly get the paperwork done and recommended the best locks for my unit. She went over all the paperwork with me and made sure I understood everything and got me on my way.

I cannot thank her enough for all her help in this difficult time. And I cannot recommend her enough. Good customer service and willingness to help, what more could anyone ask for.

Lesea, if you're reading this, thank you.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

< review>
Lesea and Mathew who work in the office and run the facility were exceptionally welcoming, friendly, and very efficient at explaining everything thoroughly and answering all the questions I asked.
The moving process was quick and easy and they treated me as a family member. Lesea has a great sense of humor... she made me laugh so hard my stomach hurts :) and being moving is so stressful I really needed that laugh.
I am very happy with my new storage place (Extra Storage). They are quite spacious units and I'm very glad I didn't drive up the street to Public Storage. The Extra Storage facility in El Sobrante is extremely clean and the buildings look as if they're new or remodled.
You won't regret renting from Extra Space in El Sobrante. It was a great experience so far and I'm excited to start moving my things in.
Lastly, they gave me an unbeatable price which fits my budget and sealed the deal.< /review>

<text>Friendly, helpful and accommodating staff at this Extra Space Storage facility. Many units, excellent prices, secure and safe, but easily accessible for customers. Vehicle access makes it fast and easy to get in as a customer. Lift elevators for upper units.
This facility had everything I needed. You can't go wrong with choosing this facility! Thanks to Brandon for being incredibly helpful and accommodating with a situation that could have been stressful but was surprisingly easy.</text><GmapID>0x8085778566f36f53:0x7b59c070ba6d0527</GmapID>< rating>

<review>I reserved the space online late night, came in the next day to see the space. I was met by Lesea, although she was having a rough day due to some technical problems with the computer she met me with a smile! She showed me the unit and the grounds is kept very clean! The unit space was perfect for my needs! She went through the leasing paper work with me and I can tell the really try to work with people! I got half off my first month and my monthly payment is reasonable for the space! I highly recommend</review>< Pics>

They have gone beyond my expectations by helping me with my personal storage unit but also my business need for a storage unit. Lesea (Manager)  has been very helpful and and has gone beyond her job duties to be there for me. I always feel welcome and would highly recommend anyone to use this storage facility even tough they have competition all around them. I now have 2 units and can not be any happier. Even during the epidemic they spoke to me and explain the issues we had. Great service Lesea goes beyond her duties to help.<//text>

<Review>I met Lesea a year ago while helping a family member find a storage space. She was very kind and shared all the information I needed to know,  with me that I needed and then when I brought my family member in to set up the storage agreement, she was not only kind but patient in explaining each step of the process. Great customer service.
Now a year later we need to downsize and again Lesea provided the same assistance and walked the property to show me what my options were available to make the right selection. Funny thing but important: as we walked she picked up trash that had blown in from the streets. It’s always clean here and she washes the units down before a move in. Whenever you visit you’re likely to see her walking around with a broom. She cares about keeping things clean. If you get to see this post I want to say thank you for your kindness, patience, help and I appreciate the consistency of service and cleanliness! Important attributes to have when dealing with people and their personal belongings.< /Review>< username>

I've had storage units in other locations and other businesses. By far the best one is in this location. Not only it's super super clean (which is a plus) but the the Manager Lesea Benitez is so nice. She's very professional and courteous. Such a lovely lady, always happy and smiling. Got my unit today and to be honest I've never had such a pleasant time getting a unit in other places. Lesea you're the best!< /text>

<text>The staff at the El Sobrante siteon San Pablo Dam Road are so helpful & fast. I have tried a lot of storage facilities and always have problems having to wait on the staff to help or fix something. Here they are quick , friendly, courteous and helpful not to mention the grounds are kept up so well, it is always clean.

<text>Went to public storage for a price check, and she was horrible. Didn't want to give me any info on units. So I went down the street to extra space. And man ol man. The difference is day and night. Lesea ( Lisa just spelled differently) is amazing. She found Me the perfect unit and I got a great deal. First month half off. Great employee at a great company. Will definitely recommend in the future.<//text>< username>

I left the facility satisfied and felt as though I had a potential new friend. We talked about things having nothing to do with business. She was bright, friendly and charming. I can't remember the last time I left a business with such a good feeling.   I hope that leseas superiors are aware of her rare and unique qualities and that she is desexedly rewarded.  She was the one bright spot in a day that had been fairly awful and I thank her for that.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Went in today to get a unit and the manager Lesea Benitez was amazing.
She went above and beyond.
Lesea showed me around and I was amazed on how clean the place was.
Don't think twice when you are looking for a storage. Come here!!!
Thank you Lesea :)</text>

<Review>Lesea at the storage in El Sobrante was so kind and helpful with setting up storage in Tacoma, WA.  She went out of her way to contact Sven at the Tacoma WA storage, who was also very helpful, to make sure my needs were met.  Thank both of you for going out of your way to help me.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Update to prior review:

To be fair I will say that this is my 2nd time using extra space storage at this location specifically, because the location is convenient, easy to manage, and has OnSite management. My first experience was good. Not many complaints except the office hours should be extended at least until 7pm for the people that work a 9-5 or 9-6pm shift.

This brings me to my current experience: Lesea the store manager was helpful and nice the first day I moved into storage 11/12/2016. So much so that she gave me some furniture coverings that she personally had with no charge. I gave her a review with 5 stars that day. Since then however her customer service has gone out the door! She is rude and short on the phone (opposite of face to face service). She doesn't practice "active listening" but rather argue back and forth until you let her have the last word. I've been behind on a few payments and simply called in to make an arrangement to bring things up to date. I explained I can make it in today  by closing at 6pm. Lesea yelled continuously that she has a surgery and will be going out of town, and that I need to be there by 5:45 in order to be helped. I explained that I'll be traveling from Antioch and will call by 5:45pm when I arrive nearby. Lesea argued for a good 3-5 minutes that I am not hearing her clearly and that she will not help me after 5:45 because she has to go out of town. (Sounds like a personal matter) If your store hours are until 6pm why would you refuse service 15minutes before. I'm out done with the way she has  handled things lately. It's always personal with her, as if she owns the company or location. I will be moving my things out sooner than later. All I want to do is make a payment and sign paperwork. This entire situation could have been avoided if she would've kept it Professional and about the customer, but she made it personal. Baffled! Will not recommend!</text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Lesea was amazing, I was moving my belongings from Southern California to El Sobrante and she did everything she could to accommodate us. She waited for us even after the office was closed and the company allowed us to do paperwork at another location before arriving to El Sobrante. I have never had such great customer service. I was originally going to rent from Public Storage but they were not flexible with us at all and we found Extra Space and we are happy we did.

She made it so much easier to deal with our sudden move. We was able to store all of our things and we feel safe that our thing our in Extra Space Storage. I always look forward to seeing her everytime I have to go to my storage unit. She make sure that every thing is clean and the storage doors are clean and free of spider webs and dust. Love her to pecies!< /text>< Pictures>
