< Review>
JJ auto repair is always so easy to work with. I’ve been here several times to get my car worked on. I got a smog, and an oil change recently. Prices are great compared to other shops. They’re always available when I need my car to be seen or worked on. Victor is such a people person and he provides high quality service. He’s definitely our go-to mechanic when we have problems with our cars. I trust this place and will definitely will be back if I need service. Thank you JJ auto repair.<//Review>

This is a family owned business.  I bring my work van here whenever I need it service. Victor and his wife are great people who are honest and knows their job. If you want good service by a honest  Mechanic, look no further. J J Auto is the best of the best.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>The air conditioner on my 1997 Toyota Avalon stopped blowing cool air.  After doing online research, I brought my car to JJ Auto Care.  Victor , the owner, explained the process, the pricing schedule and his warranty.  Satisfied, I left the car with him and came back after 4 hours.  The air conditioner is now like new.  Victor asked me to observe the air conditioning and to bring back the car if the cool air stopped blowing.  Overall, a very satisfactory experience and he did not charge me any more than the basic fee.  Highly recommended.< /text>< Pictures>

This is my local trusted mechanic for my  2003 Ford Explorer. This is a family business and owner is always quick to respond to my concerns and gives me a thorough analysis of my car's condition prior to performing work.  The front office is clean, organized, and welcoming.  I'm very satisfied with their service.<//Review>

I was referred to JJ Auto Repair by my trusted mechanic, who is not currently set-up as a STAR smog station. They don't take appointments, but they were a joy to work with and were able to take care of me in 20 minutes. Victor was very pleasant, knew what he was doing, and impressed me as being another honest mechanic that I can bring my car in to. It's a pity that on Saturdays, the shop is only open until noon and only does smog inspections. That's the only thing that would prevent me for coming in for a repair, as I can only do local errands on weekends.</text>

My boyfriend and I started using jj auto repair after his boss refered us and we wont take our truck anywhere else now.  Victor is always so helpful and gets our dodge in and out quickly and his pricing is super reasonable. He explains everything before he does it and after, victor is extremely knowledgeable. I highly reccommend jj auto repair. Victor gives the best service and him and his staff are always so nice and accommodating. Dont hesitate call victor!<//Review>

Victor was honest with me and told me that his equipment for AC services isn’t designed for hybrid vehicles and that I should probably see the dealer for a better service for that particular problem.  He could have charged me a bunch of money for a passable service, but had my interests in mind instead of his own.  I would definitely recommend him to my friends.< /Text>

I’m a big milk shake girl, and their malts were on point. Corn in the cup was a huge hit in the house. Family owned. Definitely will be coming here in the future.< /Text>

< Review>
At House of Joy, you can find your good ol' korean/Chinese food. Jjangbbong (spicy seafood noodle soup), jjajjangmyung (black sauce noodles), fried rice, veggies, and different types of protein dishes (seafood, meat, chicken).
I always get the jjangbbong (I get just the soup without noodles), Peking chicken (glazed, sweet, not-so-spicy, and easy-to-share chicken dish), and sautéed green string beans (nice and crunchy).<//Review>

My mom and I went today and I must say, I love their ice cream! We frequent the Grossmont location frequently and we are NEVER disappointed. Great service too! I believe we'll be customers for the rest of our days!</Review>

<review>Blue velvet cake?? YES, please!!

Had the blue velvet cake and a few of their delicious cookies.  At first, I was a bit reluctant to try the cake just because the blue... just looked... so... unhealthy? but, i came to my senses in a heart beat and dived right in.  DAMN.. just when i thought that red velvet was the epitome of my guilty guilty pleasure.. the cake was moist, yet firm.  the cream cheese frosting was sweet and satisfying. 1 bite turned in 10 and to my surprise, the cake that was right before me 3 minutes ago.. magically.. disappeared.< /review><Response>None<//Response><time>1540206173544</time><name>Paary Luis<//name></record>

Ahhh. The Grossmont Center store is a breath of fresh air. It is great to top off a good movie with a stop for ice cream. Take it out to the courtyard and rest and relax under a tree on a hot day. Nothing better. Isn't life beautiful?< /text>

Wow, just left this store and had the worse experience EVER! Natalie you are rude, unsanitary and should be ashamed of yourself.

Coldstone you shouldn't have employee representing your company and giving it a bad name like this.

UPDATE:

JACKIE the Manager listened and corrected my complaint and previous experience! Thanks and I will continue to be a customer only because of your awesome customer service!!!< /text>

I love cold stone. It's my favorite! I've had it all over the country.  This was my least favorite location, because it it's so small that you have to take it to go. And I've never been to a cold stone until now where the employees didn't seem like they enjoyed their jobs.  The product is the same though, so it's still good!</Text>

In Grossmont shopping center. A great addition to your visit. Right outside the movie theater,  with an open air area to sit and relax. So many delicious flavors.< /review>

<time>1463353519021< /time><Rating>1</Rating><review>I drove 30 minutes for this location because it was the only one that had a small-sized chocolate cake that I wanted. I needed to buy two cakes and I ended up buying some ice cream for myself as well. It was for a party the following day so I dropped over $60 in merchandise to accommodate my party. The second cake, which was strawberry, had cracks all over the top of it and it was the only one left. After I asked for a  discount for the damaged item, they just looked at me and said they won't do anything. Then the manager came out and said the same thing. I walked away feeling upset and under-served about the situation. The ice cream cake tasted mediocre, but I mostly don't recommend going here because the customer service is lacking. You would think relatively speaking customers drop on average about $5 there per visit per person. The fact that they made over 1,000% off me you would think they would have accommodated me a little bit more eagerly.<//review>< Pics>

We ordered a small cone for our son. The guy who took care of us was not happy at all. We asked for a simple chocolate and vanilla mix and we wanted some sprinkles he told us they could not mix the ice cream because of the size, we wanted sprinkles on the ice cream, he hands us the ice cream with out sprinkles and when I told him, hey can you please put sprinkles on the cone he seemed really annoyed. Disappointing to try and have a nice time getting ice cream for our son and feeling like we were a bother, it was not close to closing time either, middle of a Sunday afternoon.</text>

<text>Who doesn't love Cold Stone. You can create anything and every flavor I have tried is rich tasting. The cake batter ice cream is so good and does taste just like whipped up cake batter. Also the "Rocky Road" they make is so incredible. It is a great place to stop by after seeing a movie next door. #cityexperts #localguides< /text>< Pictures>

<text>A worker named Alec seemed very irritated as soon as my wife and I had walked in. Anything we had asked him seemed to be the end of the world. The other worker did not acknowledge us what so ever. Then we get our ice cream which tasted fairly bad and was not mixed at all. Will not be coming back here.</text>< pics>

<review>This was the second time my cake was wrong. After the second time I finally said something. The staff was really nice tried to help. However the owner of the store was horrible bad attitude and didn’t even want to get on the phone offer me five dollars for a cake that was worth 60. I will never come back to the store again and I recommend you steer clear I will never come back to the store again and I recommend you steer clear. I will also go on Tick-tock Snapchat and Facebook for more reviews. The owner is horrible< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This is a nice store, only thing is that they have a long line so it takes awhile but people like there ice cream. They have nice workers but I can't over help hearing people say they are missing a variety of ice creams, however in a professional view we should be able to understand that if they have long lines, obviously they will run out of ice cream flavors.< /text>

< Review>
I love me some ice cream, especially at Baskin Robbins! The service here was awesome!! In addition to letting us sample flavors before we ordered, the kind young man working there asked us if we wanted to try any other flavors before we left! I tried a new flavor today, Tax Crunch, which was kona coffee ice cream with chocolate ribbons and crisped rice! It was so good and paired perfectly with my mint n chip! This place is always dependable and I know that I'm going to leave happy with my selection!< /Review>

They need more workers when it's a lot of customers, cause the employee they have are making cakes, while only one is taking orders and completing transactions. Which makes the wait longer! But they have good ice cream, and customer service, clean environment inside store. That's what got the 3 stars.< /Review>

<text>This is a timeless classic, and brings back memories of me coming here as a child. Unfortunately this location did not have enough staff members to handle the line, and there is very limited seating available. This is why I had to mark this location down</text>< pictures>

I believe the 3 employees working here are doing their best in helping customers buy ice cream. However, there is a line out the door and it is very hot in here. People have had to exit the building and come back inside. I would not return on the 31st of the month to this location.< /Text>

<text>Good selection of ice cream, but the employees were pretty bad. No good system for who came in first, so they took three different people that came in after me as I waited there to be served and trying to get someone's attention. They also got my order wrong and overcharged me for two items instead of the one I ordered. So, they were expensive, slow, and they stole money from me..... Probably won't be back.< /text>< Date>

< Review>
The service in the afternoon is beyond poor.  The staff took 3 minutes (yes, we timed it) to get to us, they were talking amongst themselves in the back of the counter.  When they got to us, it took them 10 minutes to serve us 3 single scoops on a cup and a monster freeze.  Then, one of the employees , whose nametag was stapled to her hat, was stalking with a slur of obscenities, "the f ing bi.. " - she kept on saying in addition of so many "f" words that I honestly lost count of.  Finally, there was enough monster freeze left in the blender to make a small one, I wonder if this is a common practice at Baskin Robins, to overshoot the drinks that much.
This is the second similar experience at this store within two weeks.< /Review>

Love love love their rice! I usually only get rice and some ingredients to make tacos at home. Great place to get authentic Mexican food, or even a pinata! The salsa is just ok to be honest, but I like that they have different options. Arroz con leche there is really good also.< /review>

<review>The food is good, but the reason I'm giving them a 1 star is because they sell expired food. It's been a couple times I bring individual cakes and such home and they are expired. My little brother got really excited about a cake took a big bite and spit it right back, I checked it and it had spoiled milk spell. The fruits they sell by the cashier are also bad. I get they dont want to waste food but selling them spoiled/rotten is too much.< /review><Date>1567123228455<//Date>< user_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>If you’re looking for authentic Mexican cooking or catering for you events. A simple great tasting lunch or dinner place this place has some of the best in town. We have ordered the traditional BIRRIA with rice and bean trays from here multiple times now and every time it has been consistently amazing in flavor and ready as promised. Our invited guest do ask us for there information after eating the food and their food does speak for itself.

This place also has some hidden treats that you can only find here. I guess the owner makes his own beef jerky which me and my kids crave every now and then and I drive from Claremont all the way over there just to stock up for a couple of weeks. It’s tangy, chili and fresh.

They also sell Mexican sweet bread and all the other Mexican favorites you can think of with a mini market type atmosphere. Definitely a must discover on your own secret foodie destination!</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Their fresh tortilla chips are super yummy. The meats were good and fair prices. Their produce was a bit pricey and didn't look super great.   They have food available it smelled good but I didnt get to try it. I will have to go back and try it another day. Good location in norco only mexican market in town. Its great for a quick shopping trip on your way home.</review>

Excellent quantity of food to price. Everything made to order. Very short wait but very worth it over a pre-made meat taco. The meat behind the counter is also excellent to take home and prepare yourself. A+ Never a wait.<//Review>

I have been going to this donut shop pretty much my entire life the donuts have only gotten better. However, I have to take a star away because the hours are so weird now. I can't go on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning. And that's just weird to me.< /text>

Got an assortment of donuts here for a little treat. There is a pleasant indoor space (during non-Covid times). The donuts were great. What I enjoyed most was how friendly the staff was. Next time I will be sure to enjoy my coffee and donut there; the staff was really great.</review>

<UserId.>104483762454983731394< /UserId.><text>I recently discovered this place and it's definitely a hidden gem! They open in the morning from 7:30 am to 12 pm and at night from 6pm-12pm.

They have a variety of donuts as well as drinks. They're currently available for takeout despite quarantine.  They're buttermilk and blueberry donuts are especially delicious, but everything is great! You can order donuts individually with no limit.

It's a family owned business so it's definitely worth supporting.</text><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x808f93d2ba590063:0x79a6a8b23bf89ede<//gmapID><user_name>gen saw< /user_name><Date>1598137347623< /Date>< Pics>

Love their croissant sandwiches! Iced milk coffee and iced milk tea is also good. I ask for less sugar though, since the regular is quite sweet. Mochi Donuts are good, but I like their mochi bites better. Their other donuts are also pretty good, especially the swirled ones (French something-or-the-other). What really puts the gold in the stars, however, is the super friendly family behind the counter!< /review>

<review>Old school nonpretentious no frills donut place.  Just good donuts.  Family owned that took over from previous owners a few years ago.  The new owners have gotten better & better as time has gone on making their donuts.  It's a joy to come in and chat with them while enjoying their creations. An asset to the community.< /review><Rating>5</Rating><UserId.>116754968972232427173< /UserId.><time>1595829089468< /time><gmap_id>0x808f93d2ba590063:0x79a6a8b23bf89ede< /gmap_id><user_name>Gene Kim< /user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The doughnuts are very good. Great Apple fritters. The best part though, is the wonderful lady behind the counter. She's very friendly and sweeter than the doughnuts she sells.<//Review>

My boyfriend and I will visit all the time and they have the best donuts!! Soo fresh. And their Thai iced tea boba is so good! They’re open late which is really convenient for us as college students, and the owners are so kind and helpful! Love this place 💓< /Review>

Very nice lady. She greets you with a smile and let's you know you are welcome. She let me sample a donut hole before purchasing it. I was happy to leave a tip, and happy to leave a positive review for her.<//text>

Very nice owners. They happened to be opened til 10pm. New owners were there too and they shared with us that they will eventually be selling Bubble Tea! Looking forward to our next visit! Donuts were tasty and fresh! Some were even still warm!< /review>

This place is the same great quality & half the price. I buy at least a few dozen every time to feed everyone.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1576392093014, 'text': 'Your words are music to our ears, Thank you!'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

Amazing find. It's so difficult to find fresh and plush donuts when you're on a late night crave and I was thrilled when I saw this closed at midnight on the day I needed a sweet fix. I was even asked if there was anything I was looking for in particular when I couldn't make up my mind... :) Couldnt have made a better decision because the donut felt light and not too saturated with oil, besides that it was soo nice to be welcomed at such an odd time of night.<//text>

<Text>Great donuts. Love that he is open late.  Tiger tail donut is amazing. Blueberry cake is also excellent.  Apple fritter is always fresh and moist. Really everything that I have tried is excellent.  The man who runs the shop is very friendly. Cash only.<//Text>< pics>

One of the best doughnuts I've had, was driving home with a friend and we pulled over to grab a quick bite. They had just pulled out a fresh batch of blueberry doughnuts and let us sample! They were warm and delicious!  We ended up buying the doughnuts they recommended and trying their boba milk tea as well, also amazing. Would highly recommend going in, the owners are very friendly and care about their customers!</Text>

I will never visit this establishment again. There were lots of flies in the doughnut case. The doughnuts looked strangely small. Like the we're old and dried out.< /Review>

<Review>I use to love going to this place . This was truly the best pet store , but I went in recently . The staff was two young girls that were rude when I asked if they had a certain brand of dog food and then disappeared in the back . I ended up just walking out because they were in their own world . There was a horrible smell of the animals poop . They were sitting in dirty cages . The water for the fish tanks were so dirty that you could barely see the fish . I felt really bad for the animals and wish this place was under better care because it use to be amazing .< /Review>< rating>

<Text>I love coming here with my kids so they can see the dogs, bunnies, birds, fish,  reptiles, and other animals.  It I'd better than a zoo since it is up close and personal.

We have bought salt water and fresh water fish.  Very healthy and great selection.  Including LPS coral.

I used to got to the Newark CA McClouds in the early to late 90s.  It was a pleasant surprise to find one still around in Sonora of all places.  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. We also have gotten cat and dog toys here.</Text></record>

We are working to get the law changed to a more reasonable regulation, rather than a total ban. We can all help to achieve this goal; write your state congressperson and senator to make our voices heard, "We want puppies and kittens again!"

{'time': 1547890196095, 'text': "Valya, I want to apologize immensely for the negative experience you had at our store. We brought back the shipment of fish from the importer the day before; unfortunately, sometimes illnesses appear or a bad batch begins to pass away from the stress of the trip. Sadly, these fish had hidden issues while at the importer. I began with a large water change and some general antibiotics to try and solve the problem; but sometimes things are too serious to be reversed in time, and we did lose some of them.\nWhen Justin came to me, he asked how much balloon German rams cost, but I wasn't shown the fish. When he showed me the fish after bagging, to ask what kind it was, I told him it was the electric blue. I was unaware that a price was already quoted. If I had known you were quoted a lower price, I would have apologized and given it to you at the lower quoted price. This is something I do for our customers to stand by our word, and own up to any mistakes. We have about 4 or 5 rams in the tank, but I will pick up some strong and beautiful electric blue rams for you when I go down to get fish again, and give you one at absolutely no charge, as a remedy for the miscommunication problem. Once again, I am very sorry for the issues you experienced, and I want to assure you it was a mistake that was not done intentionally.\nI always appreciate your visits and support of our business, for example when you have special ordered cherry red shrimp from us. My staff and I always try our best to give you and all our customers a great shopping experience and I apologize this time didn't meet my high standards. I will have a training session with the staff about this to ensure it does not happen again. I hope you'll give us another chance to make it up to you. I also would be happy to speak with you directly if you call the store at 209 533 1330. -Sincerely, Donovan, Co-Owner"}<//response>

<review>Went in this afternoon to purchase a blue ram. There was one blue ram in tank as the others were in process of dying (belly up) so I was very hesitant to purchase. I asked for price of the only one living ram and stating he didn’t know so he went to ask Donovan with picture on his phone.  Donovan quoted him a 9.98 price so I took a chance and told him I would take it. He bagged it and brought it to the register and AGAIN he stated to ask Donovan, “just to make sure”. Donovan then said the price was 17.99 for the fish. I told him I was already quoted a price to which the other guy responded I made a mistake”. Very poor business practice and unprofessional. It is worth my while and anyone else’s to make a trip to Modesto to Tropical Haven.  Nice ride, excellent service and massive selection at a fraction of Mcclouds prices.</review></record></dataset><record>

Our puppies come from local breeders, not "mills", any customer that would like to speak to the breeder just let\'s us know and we contact them. The puppies can not be out where customers are in a high traffic area because of the risk of parvo and other canine illnesses, per multiple veterinarian\'s recommendations. So the pups get alternating time out of their kennels in the room behind the kennels throughout the day to run around, as well as meeting potential new families for socialization.

All the store employees helped me find which puppy was right for my boyfriend and I. The prices for little Chimney was fantastic as it included his shots. Donovan helped us pick out the right kennel/cage for out little chihuahua and also helped us find what we needed for our first puppy (puppy pads, peeing spray, ect...). Then the next day the other employees were very attentive and assisted us with finding a variety of toys and training equipment. They also helped bring all our stuff to our car. Previously, we have adopted 2 snakes (Hognose,Milksnake) from this shop. They were very healthy and friendly snakes. We get our feeders from here too! The curly haired kid who works in the back with the reptiles was very knowledge able and you can tell he is passionate about reptiles. In all, the employees and knowledgeable, attentive, and kind. Please, shop here! Bring your pets, they would love it!< /Text><user>108962255557360479540</user>< Rating>

This place needs shutdown, I recently bought a dog from here and was told by the owners it was a chiwawa mix puppy, I spent close to 400 dollars on it, and was told that the dogs are checked as puppies by a vet, seems like they would of known my dog had problems if he was looked at by a licensed vet before I bought him  come to find out it was a pitbull mix, that had some crazy birth defects. and i had to have my dog put to sleep today...Word of advise, to all who may want to do buisness with this place, go somewhere else and spend your money this place is a joke. You will be hearing from my lawyers Donovan<//Text>

< review>
I've been shopping at McClouds for over 15 years and have always had a positive experience. They have a good policy of exchange or credit.They have a good selection of supplies for all pets and I have enjoyed the advice given on caring for my fish tanks.And contrary to the knothead slamming the sale of puppies all I can say is not everybody wants to go to the humane society/SPCA for a pet as it can a very dramatic/troubling experience to the kids and myself going to those places for a pet and McClouds is a very good alternative.BUT please do donate to the Humane Society/SPCA as there are far to many abandoned animals and they need our help.AND remember to always have your pets spayed-neutered to help slow down the population explosion...this would apply to the humans reading this as well< /review>

< review>
I have owned my community tropical fish tank for a couple years now and have spent much time and effort (oh and money) into making it a fish heaven. Usually I stuck to stores like petsmart to stock my tanks and have always have great success with these fish, but recently I wanted to branch out and have a wider variety of fish. After purchasing new fish from McClouds and introducing them slowly and correctly into my (already thriving) tank a week later my tank was riddled with ICK !!! I spent well over 3 hours trying to safe and revive my fish that I have hads for years while the 4 I purchased from McClouds struggled to survive as well. 3 years and I have NEVER EVER EVER EVER had a case of the ICK!!! I've bought many different types of fish, I do my research on stocking before I even think about fish purchasing and then out of the blue a week after I get stock from McClouds my tank is dying... I will never ever set foot into this store and actually spend money on any stock they have. Not even the products they have. The owner rants about how bad petsmart and petco are but I have never had this or any other problems with those stores. This is unacceptable able I am truly disappointed.</review>

Unfortunately California changed the laws regarding the sale of dogs in a pet store. It is illegal now for any store to sell dogs from a breeder. We miss having them, so if they change the law back, we will bring pups back into the store. If you'd like, feel free to reach out to us, and we can direct you to some rescue groups that have dogs available. -Donovan, Owner"}</response><gmap_id>0x8090cf626fecc5fb:0x9add1899e9eb771b< /gmap_id></record>

Horrible - shocked to see purebred puppies lying in glass cages that are too small and the birds have very little water or food.  The place is filthy and smells bad .</Text>

<review>DISGUSTING!!!!!!! Their staff members are extremely rude and would constantly hover over me when I'd look at the animals. Many of the animals there are poorly treated and 9/10 times I'd visit, the Guinea Pigs/Bunnies never had water. And last time I was there, one of the piggies had a huge wound on it's back as well as what sounded to be a URI (respiratory infection) and the staff did nothing to help the poor thing. The puppies are most likely coming from mills and are put in tiny glass tanks and are ridiculously priced.
The staff also lie to customers about the items/pets' care just to make a profit. (A girl and mom were getting a guinea pig and they were told that you could keep male + female together and they won't have babies just so they could sell 2 instead of 1) I hate the way they treat the critters like they're just ways to make money. It's sickening. And on top of that, the owner of the pet store was convicted of having sex with a 16 year old girl and sent to prison...< /review></record>

Backpacker from Europe here. I got a recommendation from some locals in Sonora to come here. It was already very late when I arrived to this RV park and I had no place to stay, so I really didn't think it's a crime to pitch a tent in RV park. At 7 am got wakened up by crappy looking guy, who threatened to call police if I don't leave immediately. I explained I had no bad intentions and offered to pay for a stay with no respond. Maybe I was wrong, maybe didn't know rules or regulations, but this felt a bit of overkill at least.My late arrival to this place was not planed as it happened because I had to cancel my hiking trip from Lake Tahoe to Yosemite due to snow conditions in High Sierras. Luckily, I met plenty of nice people on my way, who gave me rides to come back to San Francisco as there was no public transportation in Sonora area. By the way, the guy who kicked me out from camping, looked like somebody who would get kicked out from many places himself.</review>

Very expensive gas compared to Nevada. They get you because you have no choice. Also I don’t know why they don’t have 93. The highest is 91 and for the price they are charging it should be all 93 octane.< /text>

<Review>One of your only choices to stop in a long stretch. Very high prices for gas and goodies, but pretty clean and has a variety of items at the convenience store. Bathrooms are pretty good, and there's seating outside, if you want to step out of the car for a while<//Review>< Pictures>

No prices on most merchandise. Really weird business practice given how easy it is to slap a sticker on a shelf. Definitely feels like the business is just out to take advantage of freeway travellers without many other options.</text>

< Review>
The first thing I noticed was that they wait until all of their trash bins are overflowing before emptying them out. The second thing I noticed was that their prices are extremely high, which is expected considering how far out into the desert it is, but if you pay inside they don’t let you use your shell rewards. I went in to pay cash, and the cashier skipped right over the rewards screen and said I couldn’t use them coming in, only at the pumps, which was false because I saw the screen to input my information right before he skipped it. I’d recommend they either get better staff, or that you as consumers fuel up somewhere else. I would push my car to another gas station before I go back here.< /Review>

<text>We stopped here for fuel and to use the restroom. While my husband and son were using the bathroom, an employee there followed me and my two year old daughter around the store like a hawk, getting after her if she touched anything. I’m not sure why this employee was so concerned about my toddler looking at some cheapo fridge magnets for sale? We weren’t being careless or breaking anything or stealing anything. We made sure everything was put neatly where we found it. It was very unnecessary and rude in my opinion. I’m sure there were much more important things this employee could have been doing with her time than following us around the store.<//text>< Pics>

Love this gas station! Frequently go there on trips to California. They have so much more than reasonably  priced gas... It's basically a mall food court within a gas station. But that's STILL NOT ALL!!! They have  adorable souvenirs for kid's funny one's for adults and something for really everyone on your list. Car activities for every age (coloring books for children and adults // sudko and different puzzle books// card games and a few books) and Lotto tickets// Scratchers. Scratchers can be bought at the register with a cashier or at the CalLotto Box right next to the door.  ** MAKE SURE TO HAVE YOUR I.D. WITH YOU FOR YOUR PURCHASE.** At the register and at the CalLotto box the cashier will ask you at time of purchase and if you're a lucky winner you may be asked again.
Inside you can choose from so many different restaurants and tables are set up for you to sit and enjoy your meal or place it to go and head back on the road with you.
Subway
A & W
TCBY
Mrs. Field's Cookies
Pizza Hut
Or if you just need a snack the gas station itself has endless options. The hardest part of this stop on my families trip is deciding what everyone wants to eat. Employees are friendly, courteous, and very helpful. Each of the store's inside are very clean, tables and countertops are always wiped down and sanitized. The bathrooms are clean as well, plenty of stalls so there is rarely a line (for either side).

** IF COMING FOR A FOUNTAIN DRINK MAKE SURE YOU PAY FOR ONE FIRST, AT THE CASHIER'S REGISTER OR ANY OF THE RESTAURANTS ; they do not keep any cups out by the soda machine for more than likely theft... I'm assuming.**

If I could give minus stars, I would.  Guys behind the registers don't speak any English. I prepaid for diesel, wanted a final receipt,  they wanted my credit card again . I said no, you just print a final correct receipt. When they finally did,  it was 75 dollars more! I told them to cancel that, they wouldn't.  They printed another receipt for the actual cost of diesel, plus a vanilla Frappuccino. I told them I didn't have that.  They refunded the cost for drink, but not the 75 dollars.  I could not make them understand. I called my card compay to report it, so hopefully they won't get more than the correct amount. There's no manager there and they wouldn't call one. They acted like I was just a bothersome woman who they didn't want to deal with. I don't know what else to do to get this corrected.< /review>

<Review>Okay I know it's in the middle no where, I get it. BUT $3.79 for a bottle of water. Yes a bottle of water. Plus everything is twice as expensive, including the gas. Avoid if you can. If you need to stop for gas just get enough to get to vegas, 3 gallons, or Barstow, 3 gallons. The town Baker itself should be called "Ripoff" city. Avoid this place. (And no it doesn't cost them more to have fuel delivered to Baker).< /Review></record>

Shell Station was kept in good condition and bought some stuff and on the way out went to their ATM. Ran into some troubles with it and asked the General Manager for help and got a rude response and began to tell us that my card was bad, which it wasn't since I just bought something from there. After him being rude, he sent his employee to me asking if I paid for what I'm holding. Which I did and he didn't even believe his own cashier that checked me out that I bought it. Felt harrassed by that general manager over a simple problem with the ATM.< /text>

My items were stolen while utilizing the facility. I left messages for the management to contact me with hopes of reviewing the camera system. All calls were ignored!<//review>

<text>This place was very clean, and well maintained. There were a few inop dryer and experienced one bad one. I don’t usually go to them, but I found myself with WAAAY too much laundry at home undone and wanted to just do it all in one and found this gem near our home. Parking can be a little difficult if really busy. I went on a Saturday around 2pm and it was smooth. I was in and out.</text>< Rate>

<text>I have gone to this one for years when my dryer or washer was out of service. Mainly out of pure convenience because it's close to my house, but after today I will never step foot in that place, nor will I ever recommend it again. I walked in at 8:13pm apparently the sign on the window that states last DRY at 8pm, is so translucent it's unreadable and IS NOT printed anywhere else. Even so, they close at 9 pm and it states every where inside and out last wash at 8 pm. The man working starts yelling at me "no no no! We are closed!" I asked really cause you close at 9 pm and you won't let me dry my clothes? I don't have to wash I said. the man wouldn't let us and he began shoo-ing me and my two daughters. Acting completely rude and arguing with me. So all I have to say is screw that schmuck and I will definitely make sure to take my business else where from here on.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Prices are reasonable and overall the place is clean... Don't care much for the bathroom but I appreciate they have one for the public even though you have to use a quarter to get in... But I'll definitely come back with more dirty clothes<//text>< Time>

<review>Not the greatest place to do laundry but one the closest around here.. this place is been open for quite few years now and it seems like whatever washer breaks down, stays down. By this rate, give a couple more yrs and we all be doing laundry out of one washer.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>Our group does community service projects. On 5/21/2017 at about 1 PM, we went to this laundromat and were paying for people's laundry cycles. EVERYONE was very appreciative! We were there about a half hour and wanted to buy sodas from their machine for all of the patrons but we needed the onsite manager's help because the soda machine wasn't working properly. When one of our kids told him they could only get one soda from the machine he said" Oh well, too bad." A few minutes later, one of the men in our group went and asked if he could open the soda machine so we could purchase sodas for everyone. The onsite came out of his office and ordered our group out of the laundromat. As we were leaving he said "FU" to two of our women with no regard for the women, children or customers that were present.
We've had very positive feedback from other businesses in our community where we've done similar acts of kindness.<//text>< Pics>

Been going here for years. I think there is no more upkeep to this place. Majority of the machines have "out of order" signs on them. It forces you to use the oversize $3 or $4 machines. I wish they would fix the machines.</review>

Moved to this area in 2005 and left in 2015. Used to come here to wash my comforters and other huge items because in our house our washer couldn't handle such large items and $511,000 homes in this area (what we paid in 2005) surprisingly enough are only plumbed for one clothes washer

This place has deteriorated severely. Last time I was there (8-2016) there were 10 washing machines out of order, several others have worn out bearings, making the spin cycles as loud as lawnmowers.

Other front loaders fill to the tippy-top with water, yet they only want you to use 1/4 cup of detergent. (Something wrong with the calibration)

The music over the PA system is too loud.

The owner's son is a stand-offish unfriendly jerk.

This place's only advantage is it is the only laundromat in the area--otherwise it would have folded long ago because it isn't maintained well at all.</Text>

Nothing gets rid of that grandpa truck look as good as a T_REX grille.  This is the easiest way to completely transform your truck from a  basic everyday truck to something that will make heads turn.  Everything is easy... ordering, shipping (well packaged), installation, fitment.  T-REX thought of everything and made the perfect product to make your truck like as aggressive as it drives.< /text>< Pictures>

Great Products and Great Quality, I installed the grille in a few hours myself on a Saturday including wiring in the light and am very pleased with the look and results. Their instructions good with a photo of each step on the truck it's going onto so it's not just a generic step by step list of directions.  The fit and finish are better than I have seen out there and the products come with a satin finish.<//Review>

Excellent quality. The factory grille was one of the first things to be upgraded, and this was by far the best option I found. Very impressed with the fit and finish.</Review>

<Review>Great looking grille.  Good Quality.  I have had it over a year and one half and through one WV winter where they use way too much salt on the roads and the finish is holding up great.  The only negative is that you have to be very careful when installing because the stud bolts are very soft and break easily.  Best practice is to thread the nuts on the bolts to clean the threads before beginning installation and then do not tighten much past what you can do by gripping the socket with your hand.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1542744457037, 'text': 'Thank you David, for your feedback!

Could not be any happier with my T-Rex grill... very easy and convenient to install, very durable, and very affordable. Really gives my 2016 Ram 2500 a mean look that people can't help to look at when they see. Definitely would recommend T-Rex grills to anyone looking for after market grills on any truck!< /review>

I called these people to confirm the look of the grill - which was supposed to be all blacked out. They said it was. Ordered it- was missing the outer rim outside of the grill which was shown in the picture, and what I called to confirm.
Was false advertising, been going through RMA process for 6 months they have received the product back and still no refund. Had to go through my Credit card company 2 times to reject the charge. Ive called them over 10 times and they keep saying ya we will refund it... nothing.

What a joke - Dont order from these people.< /Text>

We had a few glitches with the curbside pickup.  It took way longer then they said it would to get the order.  They forgot one of the side dishes and the topping for some of the pizooki.  BUT the place was very busy and I'm sure they are still getting back up to speed after the pandemic so I'm giving them a pass on the misses this time.
The food was delicious and the portion were very generous so we'll be back.< /review>

<review>On Mother's Day, they were able to seat us within 15 minutes and had 2 outdoor areas for those not ready to brave the indoors. They also had cute glasses they gave out to the mothers. Other restaurants in the area had 2-hour wait times. We left about the time we would have been seated at another restaurant. The food here is always made well.< /review><gmapID>0x80dcd506192c38cf:0xd5f87b53044eb97c< /gmapID><resp>None<//resp><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Food was good but that's about it. greeting upon entry was un friendly and bordering on rude. servers were professional but not personable at all.  Front entrance had a trash can overflowing with trash all over the floor.  Where's the manager? Where's the pride . Not here.<//text>

<username>Steph Toriz</username><date>1616905471710<//date><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>2 bad instances the food is good which is why we keep coming back but it baffles me the service going on here. The first instance I only ordered food for my son and it came in separate containers with no caps and aluminum over them instead, the food was cold, and they didn't give us a straw or utensils.

The second instance I ordered online and when I came to pick it up I got the bags they gave me and walked to my car ready to eat only to realize it wasn't my order since I still hadn't gotten my order I went back in to get my food and took back the bag to let them know what happened we had already opened the bags and when we handed them over they immediately changed the broken stickers on top instead of  making sure nothing was cross contaminated. This is GROSS to me because that could be my food  and during this pandemic it's never safe to get food already brought into someone else's car and being touched .</Review>< Pictures>

Had a good time. Our Waiter was great. I  typically don't like their pizza but  tried again plus they had great deals that day. The pepperoni deep dish & Flatbread were both really good. The drinks were ok... glad they have heaters outside. Had a good time< /Review>

<Review>Very friendly staff, service is great. The food is amazing. The past couple of times I have gone, there has been a bit of a wait but it's not too bad. I have been going on weekend nights, so a wait is expected. I recommend their pasta and cocktails 😏<//Review>< Name>

<text>This place is very deceiving is always pack with people, live like 1/4 mile from the restaurant this is my 3rd time there,this was the first time ordering over the phone waited for 22 minutes disaired to drive there when I walked in there was a girl opening boxes of menus or something, I asked if someone was answering the phone she said yes and she when and got some one else
If you are going to spend $45.00 for pizza.the restaurant can afford to staff properly to run a restaurant that big.
Pizza was good.
I will place another order tomorrow and see if it was one time case.</text>< pictures>

The only thing is that the food came cold which is not very appetizing. The chicken was the coldest dish. The pizza and pastas were delicious.

This is hard, its based on take out orders and over 5 times. The food is good, but we have waited over a hour for orders that were placed online. Then when we get the order, items there are always missing items, I can handle thing like a sauce or dressing. But they missed the ribs. And this is after they assured use they triple checked the order. The manager credited us the meal. But that does help much when you're trying to feed the hungry hoad and you are now more than an hour and half late.<//review>

<text>Asparagus was delicious, steak was bloody so it got taken back and recorded and came back with no seasoning left and still bloody but I ate it anyways. Then hubby ordered a drink we are clearly well over 21. Yet his paper ID issued by DMV and a military card with his photo on it weren't good enough. So let's say we won't go back to this location. Besides the fact the waitress would go to every table then walk past us. Maybe she could see my husband was not a happy camper</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd506192c38cf:0xd5f87b53044eb97c<//Gmap_id></record>

Reserved a table for a birthday. Reservation was 10 mins late. Front desk was alright. Waitress was okay. My friend ordered a pizza with no tomatoes but recieved tomatoes. I ordered a steak medium and it was cooked unevenly. Atmosphere is great, fries were great, pizookies were good but everything else was okay or sub par for the price. Not a bad place if you dont care too much about the food or service.</review>

It's amazing what a virus can do.  I generally dislike BJ's.  Lousy service and wait time, but the rest of the family are willing to wait for their pozookie.  This time around,  service was great and timely.  Adhered to all the covid19 restrictions.  Food was excellent, especially the pork chop dish, wish I had ordered.  Our server Matthew S. was very polite, knowledgeable, and gave us information on waiting time or what to expect on the dishes we ordered.  Excellent service.  My expectatikns were met and more!!< /Text>

Enjoyed the meal and outdoor dining.  We had a 25 minute wait and many customers were waiting as well as dining.  W dart in the corner of a large white teeny in the parking lot. All kinds of  people and diners. Varying from young couples to larger groups of families with little children.  The food was great and our waiter Matt was courteous, patient and efficient. We ordered the ahi poki appetizer.  This was the only less than stellar part of the meal as one portion the sashimi was not cut properly and had a tough membrane holding 4 slices together.
We had a bison burger and roasted bbq chicken salad. It was a great experience and we would tell others about BJ's Restaurant.< /text>

There happy hour starts (on average) and hour before and a hour after other restaurants.  They have great craft beer and awesome pricing on their appetizers.  Including their famous root beer glazed ribs. Perfect for business meetings without the large crowds.</text>

<review>I had a great time with my friend here. The bartenders were busy and not very attentive, but understandable due to the business of the restaurant. When they did tend to us, they could answer all of our questions about the menu and were very courteous. The restaurant could stand to staff 1 or 2 more bartenders at a time, however.<//review>< pics>

Hoping if was an off Wednesday.

Service was poor. 20 minute wait for a table. Once seated, a 10 minute wait for a server. Long wait for cocktails. Entrees arrived before appetizer. Appetizer was never delivered, but removed from the check. No apology.

Food was fine, but overall not an acceptable experience.< /Text>

BJ's is our favorite place for pizza, especially if you like think crust!! I don't know what they put in their dough, but their crust had a sweet taste that nobody else can beat. The staff is always friendly and the service is always great! If you've never eaten there you must try it!

Good location in a safe and accessible area with plenty of parking. Great late night happy hour. Good beer selection, both in house and guest taps, as well as a full bar. Always good food here and kitchen stays open late. Staff keeps very busy but remain friendly and reasonably attentive. Yeah, it's a chain... but this location does everything right. One of the best late night options in North Orange County, particularly early in the week when other places close early.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>My go to location for house beers and pizza. I love taking a friend along and hanging out at the bar for hours. The bartenders are always chill and I've never felt pressured to leave. The pepperoni extreme is my go to pizza with it's fluffy dough and delectable toppings. The Jeremiah Red is sure to get you tipsy so be sure to sober up and drink lots of water.</text>< pictures>

<Review>I come here for their happy hour. They have a nice bar with great liquor choices. The craft beers on tap are well done and span a wide range of styles. They also have "guest" beers on tap, but I don't see them sell many, so I avoid those. The happy hour prices are xlnt. Mini pan pizza for $6--yes please! Plenty of screens for sports. Bartenders are fairly attentive. Place doesn't get too crazy or crowded from 3-7 usually. Friendly people at the bar. Typically a 35-55 type crowd I would guess. Great place to take a load off after shopping Brea Mall. The building has been there since the 80s I think and the interior is unique. Their menu has something for everyone-- good for families or groups with varying tastes. It is a chain, but they do a good job here. Recommend.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>Food is good. I like their new menu. There's something here for everyone. Like the beer selection. They have their own beer plus other local breweries. Impressed that I could get a Green Flash West Coast from San Diego tonight. There might be a wait. Pro tip: download their app and put your name in to gain priority.< /review><rate>4<//rate><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcd506192c38cf:0xd5f87b53044eb97c< /GmapID><Date>1548645822195<//Date>< Name>

To-Go ordering so easy!

I was craving sweets this Halloween-trick-or-treat day so I called in a pizookie order to be picked up at 4:45pm. I had to make several requests but the lady on the phone was so attentive, courteous and very professional. I requested 2 diff flavored ice cream, separate containers (twins each want a different flavor for the ice cream but same cookie). Everything was as ordered and with a very cheerful smile and demeanor. Would always choose this place when in the area.<//Review>

<Text>Great menu choices, beer selection and atmosphere. Waiting staff seemed a little inexperienced, but seemed to be trying to please, and friendly. We left 15% even though our waiter asked us if we were ready for dessert 2 minutes after our main course hit the table? Overall pretty good food a bit on the $$$ for what you get. We've visited other locations with pretty much the same results. Not a go to choice, but will work if it's convenient and we are ready to eat.< /Text>< Date>

Great food, Sweet Pig pizza is the best. I enjoyed the Berry Burst cider too! We went with my almost 92 year old dad and he said, "Their food is always consistently good!" We all enjoyed the pazookie sampler and got 3 different flavors of cookies! Everyone was happy and loved it! BJ's is our favorite place for pizza and great dependable service!<//review>

<text>Horrible service ever! The waitress provided the worse service. The beer was warm and the wings were done with a half coat of buffalo sauce. The pizza lacked toppings and was done sloppy. We asked her for some lemons, water, straws, etc. that never arrived. I will never go back. A very bad experience for $125 bill. I felt embarrassed for my family.<//text><user_id>102447479799447808828< /user_id><Response>None</Response><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Your average bjs restaurant but what made it 5 stars was that our waiter was willing to split the bill 5 ways and did it without grumbling beneath his breath like you would expect any other busy waiter to do. We were there until almost closing so it was nice that he was patient with us. We definitely left him a tip.<//text><Date>1550511662752< /Date><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Typical chain restaurant.  Food's okay, ditto the decor, and the service is a touch lackadaisical.  It's good for moderately sized groups -- just look out for that mandatory 18 percent "gratuity" they tack on....</Text>

Had so much fun and our waiter was great. We had a pitcher of the Jeremiah Red. Our favorite 😍. We also ordered the avacado egg rolls. My SO had the rack of ribs and I had the buffalo pizza. Both of us enjoyed our food so much. We finished it off with the pezzuki trio. Best way to get through hump day.</text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>It's your typical corporate brew house. They don't stand out from each other but i guess that's the point.

When I come here I usually sit at the bar so my review is going to reflect that experience.

The service is usually prompt. I order my food with no dairy and 9/10 times it comes that way (cheese on salads is usually what they forget). The food is quiet good. The price reflects this and the service. An upscale brewery & restaurant experience.

The house brew is well above average. Nothing crazy good but not swill either. They also have guests taps that I think they rotate. I believe they have a bottle selection as well. I'm not a cocktail guy so I can't review on those.< /review>< time>

<Review>The service was good.
I ordered the ribeye steak medium rare I had to send it back twice.  I think the cook thought the order was for medium well. I had to ask the server to take it off the bill, instead the manager came back with a steak prepared as I requested.</Review>< pictures>

A worker named Yolonda hung up the phone on me. I only said I'd like to make an order.
I called again. This time a male picked up and yelled I'll transfer you to take out. I asked for a Manager was not able to speak to one. I only called the number on the website to order is that my fault?
I usually tip good too.</text>

Friday night and a 50 minute wait time.  Called in and was able to save my checkin time.  We arrived 30 minutes after we called in and we're seated quickly.  The food was good, and the server was polite and helpful.</Review>

Hostess told us it was gonna be a 10 minute wait, but it took a half hour. When we were seated a server didn't approach for another 10 minutes. I was on a lunch break and would have gone elsewhere if the server just told us it was gonna be this long< /Text>

<text>There was a half an hour wait on a Wednesday night.  I've never really seen this place packed before especially in the middle of the week. Mediterranean salmon was good but too salty in my opinion. Bold Manhattan was good, they used mango liqeur and smoked cherry as sweetener and for smokiness flavor.< /text>< userid>

If the food was good the wait would have been worth it, and it was not good. The bill was outrageous, and I left still hungry. 13 years ago for these reasons I decided to never go back to BJ's. We were invited to a Birthday diner here which we had to attend. I had hoped going in it would be a better experience than my last visit.

Our server was Amy and she was very warm, welcoming and very sweet and very attentive. I gave this review 5 stars cause she took care of my family well this evening on mother's day and I felt special. Thank you so much for being an A+ server. Look out for this server cause she is awesome. Give this lady a raise! Haha 😁<//review>

<text>One of the worst experiences I've had dining out celebrating my daughters 15th Birthday. First ordered our drinks and asked for 5 waters and only 3 showed up. We survived the water, then ordered mazallera sticks and it took FOREVER to get and once we did get them they were cold. We were so hungry we ate them anyway. I had finished my drink and asked for a refill and again it took FOREVER!! My daughter's root beer was flat with a weird taste and had no carbonation and made her feel sick we returned it and asked for water. Then we waited again FOREVER for our food and finally my sons deep dish pizza and it also showed up cold. My wife and mother in law ordered the chimcurri chicken and also came cold. My spaghetti with large meatballs..can you guess..COLD!! But I and my son were so hungry from waiting that we just ate it anyway. My waitress was always no where to be found and I walked up to a man in a blue dress shirt..presumably the manager and he was FANTASTIC!! He came over and told him about our experience and he immediately took the cold chicken plates and had the kitchen make new ones. They came out HOT and FRESH and fast. He apologized and offered free pizookis for desert and asked how he could make it right. He was on point and I have to thank him for making it somewhat right. We also overheard another table complain about the experience and that they were also regulars just like us. So we weren't the only ones having a bad night out dining. We will consider going back but most likely won't be back and find a new place going forward. Now that the manager gave us free pizookis we are again waiting FOREVER for this as well so it would seem that it is the cooking staff that made our daughters birthday so unforgettable...😩<//text>< Pics>

We've been going to BJ's for years, but  were very disappointed this time. I don't know that we'll be back. The kid's pizza was overwhelmingly bread with a small amount of cheese. The soup was delivered cold to our table. The salad was wilted. The broccoli with my salmon was not hot or even steamed. The servers had too many tables, so we were there for over 2 hours.<//text>

My boyfriend and I came here last Friday night around 8pm. To get to the point we were given a 30-40 minute wait time and then were made to wait another 15 minutes after receiving a text that our table was supposedly ready. The female host putting in names at the front desk was extremely rude. We were given the smallest table I've ever seen squeezed in between two couples after all that waiting and told that every other table was reserved which was surprising considering how many empty tables there were. Our server was Erika who was nice and gave good service. However the food was quite average for such high prices. Overall my rating lost a star for the poor service by the host staff and a star for the high wages of basic food. I myself was a hostess and now waitress so I have a certain understanding for restaurant workings, however this was my first time at this location and after this experience was my last. Would not recommend.< /Text>

I would give 0 stars if I could. Horrible service. Waiter was awesome. They messed up on my order and when they brought out a new hamburger the bottom bun was soggy with blood.  I cut the top of the patty to find it completely raw inside.  The waiter brought the boss out and the boss said his sorrows and of course took the hamburger off the bill and gave 20% off our meal and a gift card. But he told me to go to in-n-out and maybe they will make me a burger the way I want it because obviously they cant here.</Text>

<text>Do not order from Doordash from here. I kept giving them chance after change but the orders were never made on time each order I made. I ordering through that app and it's not Doordash's fault. The driver gets there and BJ's never have my order ready. I just waited 2 hours and then the order was cancelled. Very unprofessional BJ's.

<text>Our main server was pleasant and did a good job.  The person who assisted with bringing our food wasn’t especially friendly and didn’t inspect the food before bringing it to us as the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts was obviously over cooked (ie burnt).  However once you took off the outer layer it was tasty.   The side Caesar salad was basically lettuce with very little cheese and dressing.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>Service was not good. Staff was standing around talking with empty tables around while 4 parties were waiting to be seated. I opened my napkin to find a huge piece of food on my silverware, after flagging down the waitress she apologized but then never brought me a new one. Took forever to get a refill on my soda. The food was good, as expected, but I've cut my visits to this restaurant to 1-2 times a year because of the poor service.<//text>< Rating>

Sad to see BJs deteriorate over the years.  Been going to BJs for about 10 years or so, and this place is now very generic.  Food is always served like warm - closer to being cold.</Text>

Usually the service is great but this last time the server brought our food out at different times, one member of the party didn't get his food until some were already done. And she wasn't very friendly as well as having excuses as to why the  bad service that didn't make sense.<//review>

This is the WORST BJ's I've ever had the displeasure of dining at - BOTH in terms of food quality and service. Where do I begin?

Came here for my brother's birthday dinner. We ordered two medium pizzas, three Atlantic salmons, along with two sides of french fries and two pizookies.

1) Found a hair in my salmon
2) Found a hair in my pizookie
3) French fries were cold
3) Both pizzas were undercooked and hard

Escalated to the manager Chris Kemp - who did VERY little to address our concerns and proved to be useless - should surrender his management position to someone more capable of managing. Will definitely escalate to corporate.< /text>

<Review>As much as I have enjoyed my experiences at BJ’s restaurant in the past, my experience tonight has me questioning whether I would want to return and dine with them again. The service tonight was poor and I feel as if it took multiple requests for the server to finally bring us what we needed. The food took over an hour and a half to finally be served and by the time we got our food it was cold. We got served the wrong dishes without any offerings to fix the mistake. The manager did come over to check on us, but didn’t make any effort to assure us that we would be compensated for their mistakes. I’ve worked in the restaurant business and understand that it can be busy, so we definitely took that into consideration before deciding that the kind of service we got wasn’t the kind of service we had hoped for. Hopefully they can work on providing a better experience to their future customers.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Great place to catch a game and a bite. Prices are a little high but food is good and service is great. My wife and I have gone there a lot for games and for a late night bite. Safe room for dessert their  pizookies are awesome. The line can get kind of long during game nights or Friday nights but they seemed to be staffed correctly usually so they move pretty fast. Their menu is fairly large so just about everyone can find something they like.  Worth a try and if you already like Bjs this one is great.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcd506192c38cf:0xd5f87b53044eb97c<//gmap_id></record>

Friendly server who had us from pizza to Tabasco to pizookie. My birthday boys both got their free pizookies and I got my mini with my Thursday meal deal. Spinach artichoke dip is always a great starter and menu is expansive. No longer just pizzas.< /Text>

I love how late this restaurant is open. Food is pretty good (not amazing for the price). I generally order the specialty salads and my husband gets pizza. Also, can't leave BJs without a pizookie. Staff is generally friendly and helpful here. Food comes out fast. It is usually very busy here, though, since it's in the parking lot of the Brea Mall, so be prepared to wait for a table at dinner time.</text>

Sunday midday crowds we're much louder and more rowdy than expected.  Food and service was good.  Parking validation required for entire area around "The Pike" location.<//Review>

<Text>The atmosphere is 4 stars, and the food is 3 stars.... Overall I was satisfied with my meal, but nothing truly wowed me.  The waitress was pretty knowledgeable about the beer selection and had some decent recommends for the food menu also.  The price point is a huge plus as I have seen other people posting about.  The service was very fast and efficient and everyone appeared to like their job.  That is always a plus.  haha.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcd506192c38cf:0xd5f87b53044eb97c< /gmapID>< resp>

Went for a pizza buffet for a group of 25 on a nice outside patio, but $20 price per person + a 20% tip was way out of line for bready, cold pizza and an unimaginative mixed salad.  Stick to the inside menu and small groups.< /review>

< review>
This Brea location is the worst. Me and my husband wanted to have a nice lunch before I started my shift on a Sunday afternoon. When we arrived at the restaurant we were seated very quickly in between to other tables. Our waitress took our order and brought our appetizers in 15 min. A party of 10 sat behind us and the process was the same they got their appetizers 10-15 min after they ordered. Well our waitress informs us that she will be going on break and turns us over to a waiter and lets us know that our meal has been put in and should arrive shortly. 20-30 minutes later we notices the party of 10 behind us has received their meal. So we think ours will be next because we were here before them. NO, 45 MINUTES LATER we ask our waiter what is going on with our food?! He has not checked on us at all and says it should be here shortly he does not know what happened. The manager comes and tells us he talked to the cooks and they are making our food. We have been waiting well over 45 minutes because the party of 10 behind us was getting ready to leave! We are not going to wait another 15 so we ask to have our check and to forget about the food that is being cooked. All they did was apologize, charge us for one of the appetizers and gave us the other on the house? Worst experience ever!! DO NOT GO TO THIS BJS!< /review>

Service was really bad, we had a party of 12 and they took forever to take our orders and even longer to give us our food, it felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. The food was over priced for the amount that you received and the taste was average at best I would not return to this BJS</Text>

Very crowded on a Friday night, but that's to be expected. Service was prompt and friendly. I had my favorite, the Ahi Salad, which was delicious. They have several tvs that display a variety of sporting events. They also have a beautiful bar. There's plenty of parking; handicapped parking as well. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible. Clean, modern restrooms. Only drawback when BJ's is busy is that it's loud, which makes it hard to carry on a conversation. That being said, people seemed to be enjoying themselves.< /review>

Took an hour and a half for someone to come out and tell us there was difficulties in the kitchen. Which meant they forgot to put our order in. At least they brought our sons food out. Today is 11/4/16 and the night manager  that we brought this up to was clearly not happy to help with our frustrations. I get if she was frustrated with other situations that were also going on around us but she did not diffuse the situation with her attitude. I'm sure the food with be good after I heat it up. At least the snake bites were good.</text>

<review>The restaurant was extremely busy and as such, we were handed off to a different server than the one assigned to our table. Our original server never even acknowledged us to explain the situation. We sat for 30 minutes waiting for an appetizer that we had ordered. My husband was halfway through his meal when he stopped eating because he was still waiting for ranch dressing, which took three requests given to three different people, before it finally arrived. One of us had to send back a salad that was delivered on a hot plate after sitting under the salamander and was wilted from the heat. About 40 minutes into our meal, another salad was delivered but the replacement had already been delivered. We were not impressed but our server was fabulous. She had a great way with us and did a great job, in spite of the fact that she had tables in another section.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I like this BJ's. Every time I come here, it's packed, yet the staff do an excellent job keeping up their smiles and their service positive, not to mention excellent customer relationship management with a well designed loyalty program and complimentary guest services like free WiFi that doesn't suck.

Last time I came here was for a to-go order. It was around dinner time on a Friday, so naturally the line was out the door. I ordered ahead through their website and showed up, the to-go order counter is on the right as soon as you enter the restaurant. Informed the cashier of my name, and they went to go fetch my order from the kitchen. Within 5 minutes it was there (I guess I showed up a little early). I wanted to add a six-pack of house IPA beer to the order, and that was done seamlessly.

Thanks to the loyalty program, I had $5.00 deducted off my order (something about having customer loyalty points). Tipped the handler 20%, and left with an eagerness to consume the food ordered.

I ordered a BJ's Favorite Pizza which at the time of this review is "Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes". It was good and I had plenty of leftovers as I ordered a medium and didn't intend to share with anyone.

Finally, a note about the technological infrastructure. I mentioned earlier that they had fast WiFi. They also have a customer loyalty program that you can tie your cell phone number to, so when you dine-in you can collect points that way. They also regularly send promotions to your email which you can collect further points that way as well as be informed of upcoming special events (like prix fixe style experiences, usually paired with some sort of excellent beer selection).

All in all, vastly impressed with BJ's and hope to be back soon. Your loyal customer, Russell.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Worst service. Im a server myself, so I know the protocol when it comes to restaurant service. Our server had a section with only 6 tables (our table being one of them) of mostly 2 tops and yet still gave horrible service. Ordered a pazookie, gluten free pizza and a deep dish pizza, the pazookie came out in 38 minutes and the pizzas came out 42 minutes later. The runner tried acting as if it was hot with the pizza dish clap. It was far from. I put my finger directly in the center and it was barely luke warm, the pizza dish was cold to the touch. It tasted HORRIBLE!!!! I've officially knocked Bjs off my dining list moving forward and have told every person I know my experience. They too had horror stories of their own ....needless to say the vast group of friends and family will never return!!! Best bet, go to cheesecake factory!!!!</Text><userid>108645800969241603732< /userid><Response>None< /Response><Name>Kristin Torres</Name><rating>1<//rating>< Date>

<Text>I usually love BJ's, and this was a mixed visit for me. The food was terrific, our server took really good care of us, but the person at the front messed up and we waited almost two hours to be seated. We were given multiple wait times and we had to wait much longer than that. The manager apologized and gave us an appetizer on the house (by then, we were starving after all that waiting) and she was really courteous about it. Everything else was good, but the long wait did alter our experience. We were tired, hungry, and a little grouchy after waiting for so long. I know it wasn't the whole staff's fault. It shows how a restaurant staff truly is a team and how one person can mess it up for everyone. I'll still plan on going back eventually.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>I understand large groups are extra work, but just ignoring the group isn't the answer. A glass fell down and broke on the floor, it wasn't swept up for probably over 30 minutes. I mentioned it to our waitress, then later to another waitress...later i mentioned it again to our waitress....about 5 or 10 minutes after that someone came....broken glass is dangerous....make it a priority.<//Text>< gmapID>

The service was quite lack luster and slow. My food came out cold and tasteless. My girlfriend's drink had no tequila in it so to remedy this problem they charged me 8.50 for a freaking shot to put in it. I payed over 16 bucks for one freaking drink. I'm not sure if they changed owners or something but BJs has really slid down hill.< /Review>

This place is just ok. We sat at the bar and the stools seats were torn.  For the price of the food the seats shouldn't all be torn. It wasn't just the bar stool but the other seats too. Don't know how you run a business like that.  The bartender was dismissive and could care less about since his shift was about to be over. The guy that replaced him was nice. Food was ok.</Review>

This is ridiculous. I get it it's St. Pattie day and u maybe under staffed, that's no excuse for poor service. The lack of pre-bussing was horrible. Came in with a group of 10 and the pre-bussing was just horrible plates n cups all over the table. Either the asst. Manager or Manager who is tall and skinning, that night he wore a dark blue or it was black long sleeve shirt was so un professional and rude, which was a shock for a nice restaurant like BJ's. Due to this asst. Manager or Manager it will be a long time before the group I can in again. Brandon and Spencer are rock stars. A big Thanks to those 2.< /Review>

Good place for some beer and not such a good place for getting demoted from Best Man to just a regular guest. If that kind of thing is in your cards then make sure the groom agrees to at least buy your beer because i had to buy my $4 beer.</review>

Tried to get the curbside service but at night we could not find where to park for it. The lot was really dark. We had to go inside to pickup the food. Don't advertise curbside if you're not going to come out to deliver it out to the curb.<//Review>

My wife and I came for lunch. Th e parking lot was empty, many empty tables, yet we gave our name and were told it would be about ten minutes. After MORE than ten minutes, seeing several groups of waiters and receptionist talking and laughing with little to do.....we left and will probably never return. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!</review>

(Translated by Google) Very nice restaurant with typical US food. Located in Newport Beach south of Los Angeles in California. An excellent lounge with a very complete menu. Recommendation to try the varieties of tacos, hamburgers and different sandwiches. They have a good variety of beers.
