Stayed with my pup here for the sole purpose of going to Yosemite.  Turns out that the road was closed so an 11 min drive turned into a 4 hour one. But, near mammoth, June lake of course, mono lake and other attractions. If you're there to soak in nature and fishing then its perfect.</Review>

Beautiful. Some of the best views you will see in a lifetime.
Easily acessable and tons to do.
There is some off roading, hiking, fishing, tons of restaurants around.
Short drive over to Yosemite but much less expensive to stay here.

Lots of really amazing trails and places to explore.< /review>

We've been coming to June Lake Campground for 20+ years. It's always beautiful...whether the weather is sunny, rainy or snowfall. This time, beginning of June, the Low at night was 38 and the High during the day was 78. The campsites are modest, there is a marina down by the lake where you can clean fish, buy supplies and hang out during the day.< /text>

Beautiful lake with it's beach side. So much to do in the surrounding area with the town. The views from the beach is so aweome for photography which is the main reason i went there. Beach area was bit more crowded on a saturday but that's to be expected. Highly recommend bug spray when visiting these areas as the mosquitos are everywhere.

Make sure you drive around to the top view point. It's a little hidden area easy to miss. It has this dirt road that goes around. Epic for drone footage which we enjoyed. The greenish color of the lake looks so pretty. I must come back during winter time.< /Review>

Great camping spot that has amazing views and is really peaceful. Good facilities and sites are pretty private comparatively. A few minutes walk to shops, stores, bar and food. All sites come with camp fire pit and bear proof lockers for food. Can’t wait to come back.< /text>

Too close to other campers. Some camps blasting music past 10pm. Don't go if you want a peaceful camp spot... Nice location though.</Review>

All the sites have picnic tables, large lockable bear proof food lockers, and fire pits (I think with grills too!).
No showers, but the toilets are flushable, and the bathrooms are clean (considering all the dirt, rocks and sticks) and TP was restocked fairly quick.
Town, Marina / boat rentals are all within walking distance.
We will stay here again, and recommend to family and friends!</text></record></dataset><record>

Small campground, but it is just outside the village and right next to the lake and has a good amount of shade in most of the spots. Small little beach area on one side, and a little boat marina on the other.< /review>

Beautiful campground in an adorable little town.  Lots of privacy at most of the sites.  Stayed in a tent in site #12.  Loved the spot but parking was a bit tricky.  I drive a Prius and there as a bit of a drop off.  Might be better site for high clearance vehicles.  Loved walking down to the water for the kids to play.  Also walking distance to town for dinner.  3 min drive to the cutest little lake side park at nearby Gull Lake.<//review>

<Review>Primitive camping. This site has only restrooms (no TP in the one I chose, of course.), a place to park, a fire pit and a table. We stayed at the wrong time of year. 19 degrees outside and barely much warmer in our camper. Signage on our site said "see host" but it was impossible to find the host place. Oh well.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Great campground. No showers, though. Flush toilets. Less than 100 yards to the lake. 2019 fishing season was pretty bad. Maybe next year...<//Text>< Rating>

Amazing view trees and camp spot. There is a lot of big insects. It might be from the radiation. But it was an amazing experience. Please leave a like for this review.< /Review>

<Review>. This place is a very nice place June Lake is Mountain Country with natural lakes freshwater blue skies green trees fresh air everything that a person from the city Longs for if you have a chance go up to 1:38 experience nature at its finest this is some of the best fishing I have ever experienced the people are great people fun and exciting with plenty to do I would suggest that anyone looking for a place to get away and enjoy themselves and refresh their souls should go and experience nature at its finest<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<review>My boys, hubby and me loved it. We plan to go again. Restrooms were always clean. Showers are nearby. Town is close by but general store prices are expensive. But it's to be expected I guess. Lots of mosquitos but it's the out doors and there's water nearby so that's to be expected. I say if you don't like what's to be expected don't go camping. I on the other hand loved it. If you're into the camping experience I'd say this spot was great for relaxing.<//review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

The campsites are nice and spacious, but close together. Very close to the marina for boat rentals or launch. + or - depending on whether or not having full cell service and being close to the road is. Good for kids who can't put their phones down, but bad if you want to unplug for the weekend.< /Text>

<text>The site is gorgeous and we'll maintained.  But the staff was the absolute worst - rude, imperious, and the very definition of bureaucrats creating problems rather than solving them.  We had a mixup with our reservation for two days, and so had to reserve two sites over two days. The staff was aggressively hostile to any attempt to solve the problem, even when opportunities we're available, blaming their coputer system and complaining they were powerless.  Next time I'll chose a more rustic site with camp hosts who are empowered and willing to solve problems rather than make them worse.</text>< time>

Beautiful campground, however we had a bear attack. On Arrival asked the managers if they had seen any bears and we told that they hadn't seen one all year.

Then had a large male Brown bear come into our camp within 2 feet of us. Found out later from the locals that this bear had already sent one camper to the hospital, and broken into several homes.  Not impressed with the camp staff. They didn't have any pay slips out, lied to us and we're very rude on Multiple occasions.</Text>

I made a commitment to get back into working out consistently, however instead of taking baby steps I decided to walk, jog, then I thought to myself “I feel GREAT”, so let’s also sprint! Unfortunately I hurt my foot. Just like mental enhancements, physical is the same. Build your stamina, then continue to progress and take it to the next level. My Chiropractor said it best “You need to earn it”, meaning build yourself to that level to sprint or whatever else your goal is. Also of course your positioning and foot support is critical! For now I’m getting my laser treatment done, I went from high level pain to now intermittent. Can’t wait to be fully recovered! If you ever need an adjustment (not as scary as I thought it would be and feels so good after), massage, or acupuncture, this is the spot!!! Dr. Gould and his staff ROCKS!! I feel super comfortable coming here, everyone is friendly, and Dr. Gould consistently has demonstrated his care and is incredibly skillful! Cheers to your excellent work!< /Text>

I have been to several Chiropractors in my life and Dr. Gould is the best!  I have back arthritis and issues with my hips. He has been able to help me function on a daily basis....pain free. I’m very grateful for the great treatment and service provided by Dr. Gould and his great staff.< /review>

It’s almost like a miracle. The office environment is relaxing and spa like and the staff is amazing.

Through the careful attention of The Doc and his remarkable staff, I have seen so much improvement!  Not only has my pain been tempered, but my range of motion has almost been restored. Thanks, Doc!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

<review>I have always tried to stay fit and push myself.  Unfortunately I have found that like everyone else, as I age the pushing sometimes catches up with me.  I go to a bootcamp class regularly and noticed I had tweaked my neck and back a little bit.  I had never been to a chiropractor, but after hearing all the amazing things about Dr. Ross, I figured I would give it a shot.  First off he is amazing.  He takes his time with you to make sure you are comfortable.  His facility is incredible, and includes not just treatment rooms, but massage therapy and other amenities.  When he adjusts you, he explains what he is going to do before he does it, and when you are done, you feel amazing.  In my last visit I was on the massage table and could feel my left side was tight.  When he came into the treatment room and started stretching me out he immediately said, it looks like your left side is locked up.  The guy just knows his stuff.  If you are thinking about chiropractic services don't go anywhere else but Gould Chiropractic.  You will be glad that you did!< /review>< GmapID>

Dr. Gould is great. I feel at least 10 times better after every appointment. All the employees are very friendly. I rarely, if ever, have to wait. Also, the office is conveniently located to the gym so it's easy to fit into my schedule.<//Text>

<Text>Dr Gould is a very professional yet friendly Chiropractor. I love coming to his office. Yolanda and the staff are welcoming and helpful.

Dr Gould really has helped with my neck and back pain. I have arthritis in most of my joints and he knows how to work with me and quickly relieve my neck issues. His office also offers massage ranging from Thai to Swedish.

I highly recommend the services of Gould Chiropractic.<//Text>< user_name>

Absolutely phenomenal chiropractor. I've had severe back pain for the last year now and have tried all sorts of chriopractor's with all sorts of methods (even a YouTube famous one...) And have had no where near the results that Dr. Gould has provided me since I've started going there. To anyone who has even the slightest of back pain; THIS IS THE MAN TO GO TO. Even if you are skeptical, at least listen to what the man has to offer you from his service. I have yet to regret even a single trip to this place. Stay goulden, Dr. Gould!< /Review>

Having been to more than one Chiro in my life, I feel I have some experience in this area but Dr Gould does things a little different than others. He explains what he's going to do, why and what the desired result will be. I had some VERY serious pain in my shoulders/upper back from training and I have gone in to see him just two times and already I feel 90% better and have got back to training. I love the machines/tools they have to help your body recuperate but nothing compares to Dr. Gould experience and expertise. I would highly recommend Dr. Gould to any and everyone and I sincerely appreciate his effort to help me and many people like me. This is a guy who cares about his clients a lot.  :-)<//review>

<Text>About four years ago I was in two serious car accidents , my back was never the same ....  I get a sharp dull pain in my lower back and lower neck that prevents me from standing,sitting,and/or sleeping for too long. After many years of discomfort/pain and many many failed attempts at adjusting .... I have finally found my diamond in the rough!

Dr. Gould and his staff are just amazing ! From signing up to the deep tissue massage my whole experience here was excellent. I now know why Gould Chiropractic is ranked best in Chatsworth .... Three words ......

CARE
SERVICE
KNOWLEDGE

Dr.Gould knew how to straighten me out. I have never felt so much relief since my accidents. I signed up for his monthly program for an adjustment + a massage . I definitely will be back and telling my friends.

He is even located next to the Crunch Gym in chatsworth. Talk about convenience.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I used Dustin and his crew for some work on my wife's new car. I can't say enough about how it came out. They ceramic coated the whole car, tinted the windows, did a full chrome delete and applied PPF to the front bumper, lights and mirror caps. The car came out amazing. Dustin is super easy to deal with. He was super responsive by phone or text and bent over backwards to get my car in and done. I will definitely continue to use him in the future. Highly recommended!< /Review>

Fantastic experience!  OCD applied a ceramic coating on my new Tesla and I couldn't be more satisfied with the results!  Dustin is an absolute pro, he will work to accommodate your schedule and even your location if need be.  He will explain the process and even walk you through the aftercare to ensure your vehicle is protected and looking its best.  If you are on the fence about getting a ceramic coating on your vehicle, it's definitely worth it and OCD is the right place to have it done!  Highly recommended!</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Dustin was so easy to work with! I thought this process would be confusing and complicated, but he took the time to explain it in terms I could understand. I love my coating that Dustin applied. It is so easy to maintain! After he explained the wash process I liked it so much that I also bought a wash kit to do at home!
I saw that Andrew did window tinting ( I have a toddler) and he was able to fit me in quickly! I have seen some poor tint jobs around town with bubbles and cracks, but Andrew was so experienced and professional that I wasn't worried. My car was ready within hours and it didn't break my budget!
Overall I highly recommend these two as it was a super easy and informative process.
Thanks OCD!< /Review>< pics>

I originally assumed they only handled higher-end vehicles, but after meeting with the owner it was clear they were more than happy to work on anyone's pride-and-joy. All of my questions were answered, we agreed on a price and time, and the job was completed when promised. The results are pretty amazing to see, but perhaps the best reason for a ceramic coating is just how easy the car is to wash now. A quick 10-15 minutes and the Mini is showroom ready. Extra bonus to see they'd removed nearly all visible swirls on the black top... something I didn't even think came with the package. Easy, convenient, and professional. 5/5 will be a repeat customer.

PS - the mobile, complementary wash/post-coating job check should tell you exactly who you're working with here...< /Text>< Rating>

Found OCD from google search for interior/exterior ceramic coating for my car. Dustin was prompt in responding to all my queries. Got the coating done within 6 hours. All Shinny and clean. Appreciate Dustin's courtesy of drop off the car at my place instead of me picking it up from his warehouse. That is what great customer service is about! I rarely leave a review but decided to do so because OCD really deserve a 5 star review!<//Text>

Dustin took great care in ceramic coating my BMW. He’s very knowledgeable and is great at communicating which is a rare quality in business owners these days. He also has a reputable network of automotive professionals who specialize in dent removal and window tinting so I was able to get my car fully worked on under one roof at OCDs new warehouse space. My car is looking amazing after the OP ceramic, and is extremely easy to clean and resists dusts better than any other ceramic treatment I’ve tried (cquartz, and ceramic pro).</review>

<Review>Dustin and Isaiah did an amazing job on my car on the outside, windows and inside!  I am getting compliments everywhere I go!  I also got to test the inside coating when I spilled coffee on my white seat the other day.  It beaded up and wiped right off with no residual stain!
I HIGHLY recommend their work!!!<//Review><Date>1591200120904<//Date>< user_id>

I called Dustin to buff out the superficial scratches and apply a durable ceramic coating.

Dustin and his crew are masters at their craft, knowledgeable, and professional. I’m extremely pleased with my ceramic coatings and Dustin has gone above and beyond to demonstrate in great detail how to properly care for and maintain my ceramic coating.

I highly recommend Dustin, OCD, and OCD products. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽<//review><resp>{'time': 1610594034850, 'text': 'Thank you so much for this amazing review and the continued support!'}</resp><time>1610119562622</time>< Rating>

<Review>I never leave reviews but this certainly deserves as many stars as I could put. Dustin was AMAZING at helping me figure out the best option for my car as well as the best price, and doing the best job possible too! I am VERY impressed with both the excellent quality of his work and the fantastic communication throughout the entire process. He talked me through the whole game plan and provided me with updates to ensure my satisfaction. Dustin is extremely genuine and down to earth as he will be open and honest with you and help you reach any goal you are looking for! Their work on my car came out PERFECT, far exceeding my expectations and it was very efficient! I would HIGHLY recommend this business to anyone who needs work done on their car! 10/10 would use in the future! Thank you so much!!!<//Review>< Rating>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I brought two black vehicles (car and motorcycle) to OCD for paint correction and ceramic coating. By the time Dustin and his crew were done, both looked and felt like BLACK GLASS. Maintenance washes are a breeze now too.

If you want to protect your investment and keep your car or motorcycle looking its best, I HIGHLY recommend taking it to Official California Detailing & Ceramic Coatings!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Hired Dustin and his team to ceramic my Alfa Romeo, thing looks incredible. Dropped it off to him at his shop in Mira Mesa around 8am, he dropped It off to my work around 3pm. I only had the outside and interior driver seat coated, but he detailed the entire car. Looks better than when I bought it last month. Great price, nice guarantee, easy easy easy service from start to finish.

Dustin and his team always coming through clutch! Absolutely killed it when I first met him and they ceramic coated and protected my M3. Now we’re on a regular wash schedule and they’ve been awesome this yr during the whole pandemic thing. If u want ur car lookin better then day u got it, OCD is all about it.<//text>

Dustin and Isaiah did a fantastic job protecting both my 2021 Kia Telluride and 2019 Kia Sportage with their amazing ceramic coating product.

Both Vehicles really pop and the protection level is unreal.  The cars stay clean longer and maintaining their cleanliness is a breeze with the solutions that are available at a very reasonable cost.  Not to mention, water use is very minimal, which is definitely a bonus here in California.

You first post-coating car wash / detailing service is on the house and Dustin provides a detailed in-person tutorial that will make you feel comfortable doing it yourself going forward.  He will also provide a link for a video tutorial, which is a great reminder on how to perform each step.

If you don’t think you will have the time to maintain your vehicles due to your busy schedule, Dustin and his team have an excellent mobile service that can’t be beat and he is always on time.

To really put the product in perspective, on a very windy day earlier this week, I was waiting in a drive-thru when a tree branch blew off onto the top of my car.  It startled me for sure, but my first concern was what damage it may have done to my vehicle.  When I got home I immediately went to survey that damage I was sure was waiting for me. To my complete surprise there wasn’t even a minor scratch.  It was at that moment I knew I had made a great investment!

I can’t endorse OCD & Ceramic Coating enough!
You will not regret it, I personally guarantee the Company and the Products!

OCD Detailing and Dustin have been a godsend for my Tesla Model S. Dustin has been bringing my car to showroom quality for over a year now and his work has never been less than the best. For the price as well, worth every penny to get a full detail with his awesome product line and work ethic. Always on-time, takes his time and the outcome is always excellent. I recommend OCD for any of your vehicle needs, he has even been willing to meet on a tight schedule near my location. Thanks for all your help over the months Dustin!</Text>

Dustin and his crew did an amazing job with a full ceramic treatment on my seven year old car that was clearly abused by the prior owner. From helping me get the appointment I needed (I had to change my date without much issue) to making sure I understood the whole process, this team of detailers was amazing, easy to work with, and went above and beyond.

Ceramic really is the new wax, pricey but seems like really worth the money. If you value your car this seems like a smart purchase, especially with the Southern CA sun.

I have now been using OCD for the past six months as my primary car wash, the price is right and the service is second to none. The crew comes to my work and makes my black car look brand new once a month. Not only does it look amazing but this also protects your paint from long term issues.

I highly recommend OCD and the work they do, my new go-to for all my car detailing needs. Thanks Dustin and team!!!<//Text>

Couldn't be happier as a customer. Dustin's down to earth and takes immense pride in his product. Professional and easy to communicate with. Upfront pricing, stands by the product, and will give you the tools to maintain the look. Will be bringing my girlfriends vehicle to get the same treatment.< /text>

Dustin was easy to work with. He responded quickly and answered all my questions with knowledge and patience (I asked a lot of little detailed questions). He went over all the options for the exterior and interior of my car and thoroughly explained the process so I understood everything that I was investing in. Brought my car to him and he took care of it. My Pathfinder looked better than when I drove it off the dealership lot. I love that he is mobile because now I’m keeping my car under his maintenance plan. Thank you Dustin! I highly recommend OCD to take care of your car!!!<//Review>

Dustin was quick to respond and was helpful and knowledgeable in helping choose the correct detailing package for my BMW.  When I arrived he described what he would/could do and the associated cost.  I received a message from him in the middle of the day showing the progress and work he was doing.
When I picked the car up it looked great and Dustin explained how he could help me maintain the work.  I will reach out again when ready to have him do a maintenance wash.  I highly recommend his service</text>

< Review>
Dustin and his team did an amazing job on my Mercedes. When I got the car the paint looked good, not amazing but for the casual observer it looked really nice when clean. I wanted to preserve that look by having opti-coat applied. The results were way more than I expected. You can see the sparkle in the paint and it looks like glass. It’s much easier to clean and keep clean. I’ll be back for sure.</Review>

I was hesitant to pull the trigger and get the ceramic coating done but let me tell y’all I’m so glad that I finally did. I can not put into words the level of attention to detail that was put into renewing the surface and shine was absolutely phenomenal. I’m extremely satisfied and highly recommend Offical California Detailng for all your vehicle’s pampering. Great investment and service was render by a true professional Dustin you and your team are amazing. I can’t thank you enough for taking the time and explaining the process throughly. Show your automobile some love from The Offical California Detailng Crew...
Treat Ya Self Don’t Cheat Ya Self!
Thank You!!!!

OCD/Dustin in a class of their own, his attention to detail, industry and professional knowledge let alone how incredible his results are second to none. Dustin is an industry leader and delivers every time. Can't recommend Dustin enough. 5 stars all the way - thanks Justin and team!<//review>

<review>Dustin and OCD took amazing care of my 2019 Forester! I had just purchased the car and had them ceramic coat my car.  One of the best investments I’ve made in regards to a vehicle. He is very meticulous with his work and takes pride no matter the job! 10/10 would recommend!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Second time getting a detail package from Dustin over at OCD, and the second time that I've been absolutely blown away.

From the way my car has been looking, I thought there may be some minor paint damage here and there due to my own neglect of the car lately, but Dustin definitely brought the life back out of the car, and it's looking like it's fresh off the lot.

Very professional, quick (yet good) compared to other detail companies I've gone to, and VERY convenient as he was able to do all this while I was at work since he was willing to come to me.

Definitely won't be looking for anyone else to detail my car while I'm living in San Diego. Highly recommended!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Dustin is awesome; really knows his trade and the materials he’s using. He’s been accommodating to my busy schedule including coming to my house to take care of my wife’s car and my office to take care of mine. Both cars have a new car shine and feel after investing some love, the paint feels like they’ve never spent time outside. Look forward to keeping things up regularly with him.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><review>I did my research and was swayed by all the positive reviews for OCD and I was definitely not disappointed. I got my car coated and protected from the inside material to the outside paint coat. We purchased the Opti-Coat Pro for our new car and it was professionally put on and it’s amazing how it really stays clean most of the month. We have the team at OCD come once a month to clean it inside and out. What a pleasure, they are always on time and very through. I give them a 5 star rating and would recommend them to everyone!< /review>< pics>

<text>I would give these guys 10 stars if I could. I did an opti ceramic coating. It's the only permanent ceramic coating available. You never have to wax your vehicle again.  I also recommend coating the windows also. OCD will go above and beyond to take care of your car<//text><Date>1565912943776</Date>< Rate>

Dustin's been keeping my cars clean for two years and I'm completely satisfied with his services.  My recently acquired 328iX Sport wagon accommodates my German shepherd and she necessitates a lot of interior maintenance.  He knows what he's doing and won't use products or techniques that will mar or damage surfaces.  He always leaves the car looking fresh and good as new again. Every dog hair has been vacuumed off the black carpeting and every surface is clean and fresh. I've recommended him to friends and wouldn't hesitate to recommend him on here as well.  If you drive a car that you truly care about you can't do better than Dustin and his crew at OCD!<//Text>

<text>I've used several mobile detailing services in and around San Diego, but was never quite fully satisfied with the work.  It's a lot like getting a haircut and when the barber asks you how you like it, you sorta just say it's good, but walk away a bit disappointed and unsatisfied because it's not what you expected.  I guess that's what happens when you have detailers using filters to exaggerate their work and covering up the flaws.  However, Official California Detailing was the first where I was not only satisfied, but was amazed by the work.  I always thought my M3 was well taken care of,  but up close, Dustin showed me how normal washing has taken a toll on a 10 year old car.  The work to correct the imperfections were extensive, but Dustin was able to work his magic and the results were as clear as night and day.  My car went from having a shiny look to a showroom "wet/reflective" look, which is much more than what I could have asked for.< /text>< Pics>

Dustin has been taking care of all of our family cars. So many detailers tell you how amazing your car will look after their services and it never looks like what you are expecting. With Dustin, he has been consistently spot on.  He takes his time and has my cars looking just as if they came off of the lot. Do I recommend? ABSOLUTELY! Very impressed, five very well deserved stars✨✨✨✨✨<//review>

I was referred to Dustin from a trusted source who details my family’s cars in LA. I always go by referrals and this is exactly why. Dustin was accommodating to my schedule, very professional and polite, efficient, and the end result was a perfectly detailed car. My husband is a perfectionist when it comes to this stuff, and he was very impressed as well. We will definitely be using this company again.<//text>

<Review>It’s not often these days that I find someone that has the attention to detail and hard work ethic that makes me a satisfied customer. But Dustin exceeded my expectations and trust me that is hard to do. My car came out emaculate. I work in the car industry and I can tell you that the product he uses works and truly protects paint. The name of his company is such a reflection of the work he does. The car came out flawless. Thanks Dustin!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I had been following Official California Detailing on Instagram for awhile. I was consistently impressed with the quality of work I saw from Dustin and his team. I finally scheduled an appointment to have my Lexus done and even though I had extremely high expectations, OCD managed to exceed them. Between superior products and attention to detail, my car has never looked better. Do not hesitate to make an appointment for your car immediately. I give my highest recommendation for Official California Detailing<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Dustin and his team did a wonderful job on my Tesla model S red. The one thing that strike about Dustin is how passionate he is about his job and how solid his knowledge when it comes to even the finer details of the science behind the Opti-Coat and its crystal and chemical behavior. The job was well planned and very systematic. He does regular follow up and did help me educate on how to take care of the car going forward as well. My car now, needs very minimum upkeep maintenance. I went with Opti Coat Pro+ after discussing the options in detail with Dustin. Washing is super easy and looks ever so charming. All thanks to Dustin. Very happy and proud of the service that I had with Dustin.

If you are thinking of doing a paint coating on your new car, especially around San Diego area, look no further. Dustin is the go to person! He is accessible, friendly, very professional and all the more important very honest.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

It was gleaming like no other.  I asked him a few questions, and his professionalism sold me!  I use OCD once a month now and will continue to do so.  I let all my friends know about his awesome skills!<//text>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I'm one of those people who don't trust just anyone to do anything with their car. I have high standards and I expect that when my car is in your hands you treat it like your own. Dustin has that mentality, amazing level of expertise and respect. He was quick to reply when I asked about his services as well as schedule the appointment. During the detailing he was in contact with me, asking questions and getting approval of any changes or work that was going to be done. Afterwards my car looked like new or better - perfection. His work speaks for itself, and I highly recommend OCD Detailing and Dustin.</text>< Pics>

Had my x5 done with opti coat pro.  Dustin did a great job and far exceeded my expectations.  He went above and beyond with the prep work, and turned my paint job from about a 6 to a 10. (There were lots of swirl marks and small scratches before.)  I would choose him again in an instant!<//Review>

Second detail for us from OCD as it was time for a good clean on our cars, and once again I was NOT disappointed. Attention to detail spot on as expected. Very nice and accommodating owner - Dustin. Will be using them for all of my detail needs and neighbors have already asked who we use! Official California Detailing - OCD.</Review>

<Review>Had a bad experience in Memphis with Opti-Coat and suntek. Opti-Coat corporate linked me with Dustin to make things right! Was here in San Diego for about two months and Dustin took care of me and my black 2016 GMC Sierra 2500 Denali. I’m very picky about my truck. Everywhere I go I find ONE GUY I trust to wash my truck, if I was staying local Dustin would be THE GUY!

Very flexible
Mobile
GOOD PRICING
Does great work
Highly recommend!!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have never had my car as clean as how Dustin cleaned! I own an Infiniti QX 56 which I call “Big Momma” she is my baby and as a small business owner with no time on my hands, what I appreciated even more than my immaculate car cleaning, was how professional he was. I run on appointments only and he confirmed the appt as well as showed up exactly when he was supposed to. Hands I recommend this Company 100% and if you knew me you would know that this is not an easy task to accomplish. Every little crevice of my car was vacuumed and cleaned. I even check afterwards as a “test” to see if
They even got around my leather covered gear shift where dust gets into, and Dustin was the first to actually have cleaned it! So impressed y them. You will not regret hiring him!< /text><Rate>5</Rate><username>suzanne mattson</username>< pics>

I would not hesistate to recommend OCD to family members and acquaintant. Dustin is very knowlegeable and stand by his works. If you ever need to have your car detail, give OCD a try and you won’t disapointed, Dustin will shine your car like brand new again. Highly recommend.</text>

No monthly options despite sign. Thought I found a gym that wouldn't try to jip me till I called up and they tried to jip me. Not sure what it is about this industry trying to rake its customers over the coals at every opportunity. I hope you nickle and dime yourself right out of business there, Gio.< /Text>

I have been going to Gio's gym for over three years. All ages and fitness levels (I'm 65). Gio and his trainers are very courteous, respectful and helpful. All the equipment you could ever want, including free weights. If you're looking for a great neighborhood gym, whatever your fitness level, this is your gym.<//Text>

I visit La Mesa frequently and was looking for a temporary membership to a local gym. Gio and Michael were very helpful and accommodating.  I just recently started working out and they helped me get set up on the machines I was looking for to exercise the muscle groups I wanted.

I highly recommend this gym.  I will be there again the next time I visit.

Thanks guys!<//text>

A little small but never crowded, nice variety of machines and free weights, the people that work out here are actually focused on fitness and not the gossipy fashion show you see at more...corporate...gyms.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I've been training at this gym for about a week now, and I love it here. My experience the first day: Gio greeted me right at the door, was super friendly and immediately made me feel at home. Also, the parking situation is great. There's plenty of free parking behind the gym- I've yet to have an issue finding a spot.
This gym is great for the more hardcore athletes, and it's a lot less polluted than other hardcore gyms in San Diego. The equipment is old school, there's a fantastic posing room upstairs for the bodybuilder types, and Gio has stocked the floor with everything you need for a successful workout. Everyone here is really nice and it feels like a family. I've trained during the typical business hours, and never once had to wait for a piece of equipment.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80d957234c8e83a1:0x9a3c0429ea243c59< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I walked in to talk to the owner who was working at the front desk. He was a major jerk and was very short with me. Horrible customer service. Just because you're at a gym doesnt mean you need to act like you're too good to talk or cold and dismissing.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Had a great experience with Super Cheap Car! Steve was funny and very accommodating. Never really had a good experience/luck with the major retail car rental chains, so it was such a breath of fresh air to have a car rental agency that didn't nickel and dime you. In fact, I had the opposite of getting nickel and dime'd! 😂 Steve tacked on complimentary discounts and upgrades without me asking. Thanks Steve! I highly recommend Super Cheap Car if you are on a budget. Great 5⭐ service< /Review>< user_id>

So, I just rented a car for a week. First and foremost, Steve was so personable and accommodating. He made the process easy and smooth. The car was not new, but had a lot of pep and it took me where I needed to go. It was a great experience from start to finish. Don't hesitate to rent here!</text>

<Review>This was the easiest, cheapest, and BEST car rental service I have ever used! The owner was very accommodating to my circumstances, and the car itself was great. No frills, but clean, safe, and it got great gas mileage. Value = Experience - Expectation, and you can't beat this value. Also its a small business, so you should support this over enterprise or whatever (blah).<//Review>< time>

This place does exactly what they advertise - it is the cheapest rental in the area. The cars are a bit beat up, but they run! So if you don't care about the looks too much, this is the most cost-effective option in the region.</Text>

The owner of this place is outstanding.   Not only did I get a great deal to begin with, he discounted my rate further.  He even paid for taxi ride to the airport when I dropped off .  My car was clean and ran great !  Plus got great gas mileage.  Cant say enough great things about this place !!!!!< /Text>

The reviews are true. Steve really is an honest, old fashioned good guy. I was paying 35% more with Hertz but now can use the money saved to help the homebound elderly with groceries during the Pandemic. Excellent price, unlimited miles, awesome car. Highly recommend.</Review>

I travel to San Francisco a few times a year and have always rented from a name-at-the-airport brand.  Last week was my first rental experience with Super Cheap; it will now be my go-to rental car company when in the bay area.  Wicked easy to book online and the car was clean, comfortable and easy on gas.  Steve even drove us to SFO in the vehicle when we returned the car.  No waiting in line, no schlepping bags onto and off a shuttle bus.  And the price was unbeatable.  TY, Steve!!< /Text>

<text>At first it was hard to find the building because Google Maps brought us to the wrong side. But after that we had no problem to get the car. The service was very nice and we could start our road trip without any problems. The car was clean and in good conditions.
Unfortunately when we wanted to drop off the car after office hours we could not find the mailbox of the company. We were told that it was no problem to bring the car back after 5 pm, we should just simply search for the mailbox and drop the keys there. After searching for a while we gave up, called the office and left a voicemail to tell them that the car was back and we took the keys with us. The next morning we were told that we should have left them in the glove compartment.
All in all we liked the Rental but a few things could be improved.</text>< Pics>

<Review>We had a great experience with Super Cheap Car Rental! It was easy, fast and affordable. The car was better than expected and  Steve was very helpful with info about about our stay in the San Francisco area. If you have  any doubts because of the name, don't. I have rented from many big name car company's  and this was by far a better car rental experience. It wasn't a 2019 luxury car, but they have good cars at a fair price. No junk here...Thanks again Steve.< /Review>< GmapID>

Super Cheap? Yes. Super Good? YES! Honestly, best rental car experience ever! Super solid customer service, and overall just great vibes. I kinda don't want to let people know about it so that they won't get overbooked, but they're awesome and everyone should rent with them!</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Although the name of this car company isn't immediately confidence-inspiring, I gotta say I was pretty impressed!  By far the best value option for car rentals at SFO, Super Cheap Car Rentals really provided excellent service and value.  I was picked up at the airport within minutes of arrival and was on the road within about 15 minutes thereafter.  The vehicle itself was a Ford Fiesta that looked like it had seen some better days, but really what can you expect for $40 USD/day.  Filling up the gas tank at San Francisco prices was almost more expensive!  Everything seemed to work as it was supposed to, although there was no remote control to unlock/lock the car, and deciphering the audio control panel took a bit of work (though this is a Ford issue and not a problem with the car rental company).  I essentially drove all the way down to Big Sur and back to SFO without any issues at all!  Dropping off the car was likewise a breeze, and the car rental place is right across the street from the BART station so it was easy to get into downtown San Francisco afterwards.  Would definitely recommend this place if you're a budget-minded person renting a car in the SFO area and don't really car about getting a top of the line new vehicle.<//review>< Pictures>

This place sounded too good to be true but luckily for me it was 100% legit and awesome. I was traveling with several bags and they picked me up right at baggage claim within 10 minutes of calling. Checking the car out was extremely quick and efficient as was the return and it was so affordable. The folks running the place were as nice and as helpful as they could possibly be. I will always use them from now on and you should definitely give them a try!<//review>

Getting to the place was done quickly and easily (they shuttle you to the lot) and there is a great selection of various cars to choose from.

Would highly recommend and will definitely use their service ago once I am in San Francisco again!

Edit: Rented a car from here two years later. Still received great service. Highly recommend this place if you need to rent a car!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>If you’re doubting to rent your car with this place, don’t! Super Cheap is honestly the best company I’ve ever rented with. As the name promises, the rentals are super cheap. However, it doesn’t compensate the quality. The car we got for our 2 weeks roadtrip worked perfectly fine and got us everywhere comfortably.

The service and the people here are great too! We couldn’t make our return time because of the traffic, but with 1 quick call we were allowed to take a few hours longer!

The car was a bit beat up with scratches here and there, but it ran perfectly fine.

Definitely renting again with Super Cheap!</Text></record>

<review>They picked us up from the airport in the car that we were renting and we hit the road shortly after. It was way cheaper than the competitors in the area and I think it was a better experience.

I'd absolutely rent from here again.</review>< Resp>

The entire paperwork process took 10 minutes, staff was extremely friendly and down to earth. We weren’t pressured to buy extras like most other car rental companies. The car ran great and was just what we needed.
We are very happy with our experience and will definitely be renting from Super Cheap car rentals again. We fly back and forth from Denver to SF 4-5 times a year and always need a rental car so I’m very glad we came across this company!<//text>

Great prices, great service. Steve picked us up from airport. Very convenient. No nasty shuttle bus. The price was great and the charge for a one way drop off at LA Airport from SF was half the price of competitors. Will definitely use again</Text>

Had to Lyft back to the airport after dropping the car off on a Sunday when they were closed. The car was clean and really good on gas.  I would definitely use again.< /Review>< Pictures>

Everyone was super nice. The pickup was very easy: they come to the airport in the car you'll be renting. When we dropped off, they just turned around and drove us back to the airport in the same car. It was much quicker than the nightmare of in-airport SFO rental car services. I appreciated that we had minimal luggage transfers and no lines.</review>

Super Cheap Car Rental was great !
Super easy and straight forward.
It is located a few minutes out of the airport and everything was set up in 15 minutes.

Rep were both professional and super friendly,
Didn’t pressure us to take any extra insurance or anything not necessary.

We had a great time, would definitely
recommend !

<Text>I always have a positive experience at Super Cheap over the years. I find Steve and Jessica flexible and pleasant to deal with, and I really appreciate that the prices are always crystal clear with no hidden fees. I personally enjoy dealing with a smaller operation in which I can get to know the people a little bit rather than a vast impersonal bureaucracy. The location right across from the Millbrae BART station has also proven convenient at times.</Text>< Name>

The very best service, picked up at airprt and shortly after  we were on our way. Steve and Jessica were marvelous, we extended our rental and then we were dropped off at our hotel, nothing was too hard. Certainly recommend this company for anyone needing to rent a car, we had a compact that ran perfectly. Thanks Steve and Jessica.</review>

I have rented from Super Cheap cars a number of times already through the years and have always had a pleasant experience from them. The cars they have maybe not as nice as some big name car rental places but they get the job done and has never given me any problems specially the last time that I rented a Nissan Sentra from San Francisco and drove it all the way down to LA and returned the car at their Orange County outlet. I’d definitely rent from them again when I visit again soon<//text>

Wish i would have found this place sooner!  Steve was the best.  My flight was a bit late arriving on a Sat, and i thought the place was going to close.  Steve left me a voice message, and he picked me up at arrivals and it was so easy and comfortable.  Now I know!  I'll be back in Aug.  Thank you!< /Text>

The car was nice for what we needed and we had one small problem with the car but we communicated with Steve the minute it became an issue and he was super nice and fixed it immediately. Very happy with my experience If I could give this place more then 5 stars I would. He picked us up from the airport and dropped us back off when we were leaving. So don’t be scared to rent from this place just because it’s cheaper. It’s the way to go! I’ve had so many problems with previous rental car company’s like enterprise, etc. and this was the easiest one I have dealt with. Will forever be renting from him when we go to Cali. Wish he had more places as well!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>The owner came to get me at the airport about 10 minutes after I called.  I had used Advantage the week before and found it really frustrating so I wanted to try something new.  With Advantage, the van took forever and you had to walk a long way to even get to it. Super Cheap was much, much easier.  When I dropped off the car, Steve was dealing with some other customers so he called a taxi on his dime to take me to the airport (so that I wouldn't miss my flight).  Terrific service and great value.  I will definitely use them again next time I am in San Francisco.< /review>< Name>

We had a very good experience with this car rental company. It is not one of the bigger players on the market but they can give you a good price compared to other companies especially if you are below 25 years old. We had no issues at all, very good communication etc. Would definitely recommend!</Text>

Everything went smoothly with our rental. We've never rented a car with as many miles or dings on it, but so what? We rented in San Francisco, drove down the coast, and our drop off in LA went smoothly. We were quickly driven to the airport in the same car we rented, so we didn't even have to move our luggage! We would rent from this company again.<//Review>

<Text>Steve, the owner of Super Cheap Car Rental, was very professional from the beginning to the end of our rental experience with him.  He knew our flight itinerary and called us soon after we landed to let us know that he was on his way to pick us up.  After we picked up our bags he was there to greet us and take us to our rental. After a short visit filling out papers we were on our way with a new comfortable Toyota. The vehicle performed very well and the return was just as seamlessly easy. Thank you Steve for treating us on the royal side. You gave us a nice experience and we will be using you again!< /Text><Name>Guy Brooke</Name>< Resp>

I needed a car for 30 hours, and Super Cheap Car Rental was the only company that was willing to charge me for a single day instead of two. This is a small company, and Steve, the owner, personally picked us up (from the arrivals - we did not have to take the shuttle to the Car Rental). Very friendly, and very proficient. I removed one star because there was no shuttle service back to the airport on Saturday afternoon, when we returned the car.<//Text>

<review>Let me start off by saying San Francisco car rentals are extremely expensive and overpriced 98% of the time.. I'm a 23 year old driver and was looking high and low for a rental car company that wouldn't break the bank. I finally came across super cheap car rentals.. at first I was sceptical by the price but a quick phone call and I was hooked.. upon arrival I was greeted by a very friendly and honest owner and just like that I had my vehicle.. 5 days and 860 miles later i not once had and regrets. Owners personally took me and my girlfriend back to the airport. So from New York City I want to thank Super Cheap Car rental for making my experience amazing!! Excellent service and extremely recommend!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808f77b0d2e43617:0x94b87d9137e34435<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Fantastic. How come more Aussies don’t know about these guys? They should and save a bundle. We were looking at paying over $2k Aussie with most of the majors, however we ended up paying $750 with Super Cheap and are so happy we did.

We rented a VW Jeda for two weeks and just returned it only days ago. In Sydney, we optioned online for a Corolla-size vehicle and hence received the Jeda.

Their cars are a few years old, however they look quite contemporary and ours behaved like clockwork. We drove all around California and even to Yosemite. The owner (Steve, I think) even provided snow chains in case we needed them. Fortunately, even though there was snow on the ground, it wasn’t thick enough to have chains installed. Which I was thankful for as they are a hassle to get on and off. It was just a case of driving slow and careful.

I opted for the mechanical support which wasn’t that much extra. We didn’t need it, but in a different country it was nice to know we had that backup.

Finally, I should underline that there are no hidden extras here!!! You know how it is with rental car companies when you turn up to get your car and they whack on extra insurance costs that totally knock your expected budget. Not these guys.

Totally laid back and trustworthy. I must also mention you’ll get lost trying to find these guys on Google maps. They are only a few miles from the international airport so an Uber will get you here in minutes. Just get as close as you can and ring the office. They’ll come out to find you.

Its worth it!

Cheers, N.< /Text>< Pics>

First class service! Steve picked me up at the airport. He actually phoned me, instead of the other way around! Despite my mistake about arrivals vs departure levels, was patient and collected me on time. After some paperwork, I was able to make my way to the city and spent the weekend exploring. The car was in good condition and was comfortable. I had zero issues with it. Since I was returning after hours, I merely needed to drop the car and keys and was on my way. Thanks for another GREAT experience! I have used Super Cheap every time I'm in thr city and have had nothing but good things to say. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Very easy and super affordable rental car for SF! The prices are about half as much as other rental car companies and no wait to pick up or drop off. The staff are friendly and very responsive. The only thing is that they’re about 5 min away from the airport and if you’re dropping the car off when they’re closed, you’ll have to find your own way back to the airport, but they usually pick you up from the airport to the rental car. Also be sure to check their hours. Because they are a smaller shop, they’re not 24 hours. I would definitely rent from them again!</Review>

<Review>The rental was everything that I expected and more. Steve, the owner or manager, picked us up at the airport and would have given us a ride to the airport on the way back if they were open on Sundays. Everything was fast and as promised, if not better.

True to its name, Super Cheap Car Rental is very cheap, but they've got a great system and they are definitely worth the money that we paid. I've rented cars in the past, but this was easily my best experience. The paperwork was quick and easy, unlike other larger car rental companies.

I hope they expand to more cities so that I can use them wherever I travel in the future.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Steve and Super Cheap were a dream to rent from! The name definitely got my attention, and I was admittedly cautious. However, the process was delightful: Steve was efficient, friendly, and super accommodating. He picked me up in perfect timing from my flight, and got me going within minutes. I plan to rent from Super Cheap again when I am back in San Francisco in the fall!</Review>< Pictures>

absolutely best car rental experience ever!!! don't be put off by the not-very-corporate office--Super Cheap gave me EXCEPTIONAL and UNPRECEDENTED personal service, a great car and accommodated my unusual schedule. i can't even say enough about how thrilled i was to have found them. 10 stars would hardly be sufficient.< /text>

Great car rental place especially for younger people such as students, travelers under the age of 25. Company is great! Cars drive perfectly. Friendly staff!</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>At first I couldn't believe a car rental company like this exists.  Steve the owner picks you up from the airport (SFO) directly, paperwork takes five minutes, and off you go?  Ridiculous.  But it does exist.  And last but not least, the price. Even more ridiculous (to your favor).   Somehow  Steve and company are making it all work. I will definitely be a customer again.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808f77b0d2e43617:0x94b87d9137e34435</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This seriously was the best car rental EVER!
Not only did we get picked up by the owner at the airport with our rental car, he also gave us excellent recommendations  of roads and routes to take etc. We just rented a Ford Fiesta not too fancy but bluetooth and 'guaranteed' parking space and no worries of being robbed in the city : )
I would highly recommend this place and always go back to them again !!
Thanks for a fun time in SF !!< /review><GmapID>0x808f77b0d2e43617:0x94b87d9137e34435</GmapID><Time>1569807325191<//Time><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

Best rates I found anywhere near SFO and the car was late model and clean. Steve picked me up within 10 minutes of calling him from baggage and we were at the office in minutes.

Absolutely no complaints and will definitely use them again!</text>

<Review>My second time renting from Super Cheap Car Rental, and it was another great experience. It was actually faster to pick up and drop off car than using the Rental Car Center (and certainly more personable). Car maybe had a few more nicks and cuts, but ran great. The price is certainly right. Only downside is no off-hours shuttle, but Lyft was easy and quick.< /Review>< user_id>

<Review>What a nice experience. Renting from Super Cheap is easy and personalized. They called when I arrived and made the check in process painless, even with some computer problems  that caused us to go to old fashioned paper! They have a key slot for after hours drop off. Not sure about the shuttle as a friend gave me a ride. I will rent from them again.<//Review>< Pictures>

Car (Dodge Journey) was in very good condition and we could not ask for more with the price.  Their Service is top class, very quick and Steve was very helpful both during checking in and checking out. Car was ready as per the booking time and Steve dropped us back at the SFO terminal in the same car with the baggage.<//Review>

< Review>
Super Cheap Car Rental is by far the best deal for a rental out of SFO!  Literally 1/4 the cost of a rental from one of the corporate companies, and much more customer-friendly and personable. The owner Steve is wonderful, and provided great communication via email and text, and picked us up at the airport on the arrival, dropped us off for departure. I will definitely be renting from them again any time I’m in SF.</Review>

Terrific experience.  Their price was a lot lower than the well-known competitors, so I hesitated to book, but I'm delighted I did.  Quick, friendly service: picked up promptly at the airport (SFO), on our way in no time, and they even lent us an iPhone charger for free when we discovered we had left ours at home.  Highly recommended!<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Super Cheap is great! We rented a car from them on short notice and they were accommodating and got us a great little car that was easy to take all over the city. They really went above and beyond for us when we accidentally forgot a few belongings in the car after we returned it— they were very understanding and sent our items back to us very quickly. They even took care to pack the package so that the glasses we forgot wouldn’t be scratched in transit. Clearly these folks care about their customers!< /review>< gmap_id>

Wow, what personal service! We really enjoyed meeting the owners--we felt very welcomed! The car was terrific and felt very safe, even with our new baby and nutty bay area traffic. They picked us up and dropped us off at the airport, even though it was a national holiday!<//text>

< Review>
I needed a short-term car rental at the last minute, and booked with Super Cheap for its price and good reviews online. My flight was delayed several times, but Steve was still kind enough to accommodate my after-hours arrival and pick me up from the terminal. Steve was a funny and enjoyable companion on the short trip from Terminal 2 to his office/parking lot, across the street from the Milbrae BART station. My car was older but in great condition. Got me from Point A to Point B without any issues. Returning the car the next day was also a breeze. At this price point, can't really beat Super Cheap Car Rental. Thanks Steve!< /Review>

I was surprised to see the rate I got but It was well worth it..These guys aren't like your average car rental agencies with all the up-charges in their rate. $30 for 2 days with all taxes included..tht's a STEAL!

Steve is your man..he is the owner of the place and he takes good care of his customers. He takes his business very seriously and makes sure you are fully satisfied. I hope he expands his business to other cities. But when i do go back to San Fran, I know where to rent my car from!!< /text>

<review>I booked online, as for how long i need it the car, here I got the best price. I got the price for one day, even if the duration of rent was 31 hours, and because other agencies will charge 2 days, here was the best price. I called when arrived in airport, and was picked up with the car I was renting (no need for more luggage handling) in 4-5 min. Went to office, and in about 15-20 min I  was on the road.  Forgot the person name, but was super nice and friendly. Rented Friday, and as they don't work in the week end, I could have had the car a bit longer than what I booked for no extra charge, but as I had a scheduled a flight next day, I returned it as booked. The reverse of not working in the weekend, was, I couldn't get a ride back to the airport and I had to pay $24 for a taxi. Even with that, was still cheaper than other rental Quotes, but came closer. Not having a ride back to airport, on the return, is the reason I shaved a star, other wise was perfect.< /review>< userid>

Excellent service, easy pick-up near Millbrae station.  Car was SUV and worked out great for a trip to Tahoe.  They included chains just in case too, which was incredibly helpful.  Great communication through reservation to pick-up.  Will certainly rent from them again!< /Text>

It was refreshing to deal with an actual person, a small business with a fully invested person answering my questions and setting me up with my car rental instead of someone who hates their job sitting behind a desk trying to sell me additional insurance. The car was an upgrade from what I had initially requested and I couldn't have ask for more in term of service.< /text>

Great down to earth folks while booking my car rental. Had mostly good car experiences except for one car that was a lemon; the Ford Fiesta - a cheesy little car with lots of 'blind spots' due to the configuration of the windows and a horrible front seat that was hard to adjust until Steve showed me how to adjust it (weird location along outer (street) side of front seat towards back).  I have rented other cars that worked out fine. Just don't rent the little Ford Fiesta - it's a piece of cr*p. Steve was great and so was the lady who works with him (sorry ,her  name eludes me right now),</Text>

I’m not sure if the woman’s name I had the unfortunate pleasure of interacting with but customer service was not her strong suit. She was rude when picking us up. Couldn’t be bothered to get out of the car when she picked us up or went say hello when we got in the car. I also didn’t receive the car I requested or anything even close. I asked for a standard and was given a SUV.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I booked online, as for how long i need it the car, here I got the best price. I got the price for one day, even if the duration of rent was 31 hours, and because other agencies will charge 2 days, here was the best price. I called when arrived in airport, and was picked up with the car I was renting (no need for more luggage handling) in 4-5 min. Went to office, and in about 15-20 min I  was on the road.  Forgot the person name, but was super nice and friendly. Rented Friday, and as they don't work in the week end, I could have had the car a bit longer than what I booked for no extra charge, but as I had a scheduled a flight next day, I returned it as booked. The reverse of not working in the weekend, was, I couldn't get a ride back to the airport and I had to pay $24 for a taxi. Even with that, was still cheaper than other rental Quotes, but came closer. Not having a ride back to airport, on the return, is the reason I shaved a star, other wise was perfect.<//Text>< pictures>

BEST SERVICE EVER!! Rented cars from them over five times, and it's always been with great service, a nice and clean car, and a VERY good price. The price at the airport is more than the double the price compared to this place - So I would highly recommend saving those money and rent a perfectly clean and working car from Super Cheap Car Rental. Renting another car i July, and I know it will be easy and affordable as always!</Review>

Call as soon as you get to the Baggage Claim area. They’ll come pick you up from the Arrival area and take you to their office ~8min from airport. It took 5 min to complete the paperwork and I was on my way! Super friendly service and way better than those big brand car rental companies. Save your money and get a more personal service.<//Text>

In San Francisco you take a train to the main brand rental facilities, which I did, incorrectly.  Super Cheap explained what to do, but I didn't listen.  They promptly found me anyway.  I was very pleased with the service and car.  I had to turn it in very early (4:00 AM) before they opened and take Uber to the airport, but that wasn't a problem (my first time taking Uber).  I recommend this car rental company because it was cheaper.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I'm a frequent renter of their car. Steve and Jessica are always very helpful with the pickup and drop off from and to airport. Last Nov we were in San Francisco and rented their car again. I‘d like to take the chance to apologize to Steve. When Steve dropped off us at airport, we forgot to give him the car key. He had to drive back to airport getting the key.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808f77b0d2e43617:0x94b87d9137e34435< /Gmap_id>< response>

I highly recommend this rental car company.  Even before I had left the plane upon my arrival in SFO, the kind souls from Super Cheap texted and called me to facilitate an expeditious way to get me to my car.  I always felt like I was in good hands.  It’s a small business, and everyone takes pride in their work.<//Text>

Very friendly staff! We grabbed our bags after landing in SF and they were there inside of 10 minutes to pick us up. Paperwork was quick and easy and we were off to explore! The absolute best price we could find and for a nice car (2015 Sentra, clean inside and out). Highly recommended and will definitely use again if we're in the area!</Text>

This car rental company is GREAT! Efficient, friendly, fast, personal and the rates are the best. Limited pick-up hours may not work with everybody's schedule but I can dropped off my car after hours and it was a quick Lyft ride to the airport.< /Review>

I was a bit skeptical because of how cheap the price was for my 5 day rental car trip in San Francisco... WOW! I was blown away. Picked up in 15 minutes after calling, little paperwork, and was returned to the airport promptly after returning the car. Can not speak highly enough about this rental company. Don't let the price or unknown name brand fool you, these cats will get you hooked up with an affordable, reliable car! THANK YOU!!!< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Second time using Super Cheap Car Rental.  This time it was my wife who was traveling alone and they took great care of her.  The process is easy, make a reservation on line being sure you arrive during their open hours.  On arrival at SFO, pick up your bags from the baggage claim and give them a call.  They'll tell you where to meet them (door outside of the baggage claim) and what they will be driving.  Someone will be along to collect you for the short drive to their office.  You can also elect to take a cab or ride the BART if you choose instead of calling for a pickup.  Once at their office, you are quickly on your way. Cars are not new but they are in very, very good condition.  The hardest part of the whole rental process was finding my way back to their office to drop off the car so bookmark the location in your GPS and you'll be good to go.  So, if your flight times permit, give these folks a try, you will be pleasantly surprised at how quick, easy and affordable renting a car can be at SFO.  I rate them 5 stars for excellent/friendly service and good cars at reasonable prices.  Would I use them again?  I just did.  They are definitely my go to place for car rentals at SFO.< /Review>< Pictures>

I've rented a few times from here and love it.  I hate renting from SFO because of the long lines, expensive prices, upselling insurance, etc.  It's absolutely delightful renting a car from this place.  Steve is great.  Communication is great.  They run a wonderful business.  I'll never rent from any place else in San Francisco.< /review>

Very reasonable pricing and if your 21 and over you wont be charged an under 25 year old driver fee.

Though while I was driving, 1x hubcap fell off the vehicle with i was charged $25 fee for (could not find that in the contract), overall still alot cheaper then the major car rental agents in San Fran.

100% recommend this company.

Real people who really want to help make sure your experience is the easiest possible. I made the initial mistake of thinking I needed to rent from a place with facilities at the actual airport. After standing in a chaotic line at Fox rentals for AN HOUR, I called Super Cheap. Jessica answered, picked me up in fifteen minutes, rented me the perfect car, gave me all the info i needed and sent me on my way smiling. I will never rent from anyone else at SFO, and neither should you. Meanwhile, Fox got a one star while I was still standing in that crazy line. Thanks, Jessica!<//review>

It is SUPER cheap, with no hooks. It's so hard to find a car in the bay area and this place was so much lower than the regular rental places. No hassles or surprises, just BYO insurance.< /Text>

This place is REALLY hard to find. Once you do, you'll be glad you took the time because the prices are much lower than the competition. The staff is really friendly & the transaction was smooth, quick & I was on the road within minutes. Not a big selection of cars to choose from but if you're more budget conscious, that shouldn't matter.</Text>

As some other reviewer said: The only thing cheap here are the prices. What's not cheap: The staff, which is super friendly. You get a lot of stuff with your rental you have to purchase elsewhere, they don't let you pay extra when you're younger. They let you pay everything in cash which is useful if your credit card is maxed out by travel expenses.

The car I got had very clear signs of use and the location is a rather long BART drive from downtown SF. Still, a 5-star rental for me.</Review>

I got set up with an SUV that did not fit the 3 car seats. The fasteners were also under the carseat next to the child. It was difficult to wedge and tip the seats to fit them in so the doors would close. It would have helped if the staff would have known which vehicles fit 3 carseats. The staff had changed my vehicle from my reservation request which caused more issues.< /text>

<review>Steve provided customer service above and beyond expectations, and all with a smile!
From booking the truly cheap rental to being picked up at SFO with no delay, I was hooked. He went over the car particulars quickly, and I was on my way. in no time. The car was clean and reliable - exactly what I needed for a week in Monterey and Big Sur. Steve went a step further and even allowed me to drop it off after hours without a penalty. The location is conveniently located right across the street from a large BART station, making the drop off and connection to my place in SF a breeze. The next time I travel to SF and am in need of a rental car, I will absolutely go back to Super Cheap Car Rental. Steve is a trustworthy and honest owner, a pleasure to work with!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>I got set up with an SUV that did not fit the 3 car seats. The fasteners were also under the carseat next to the child. It was difficult to wedge and tip the seats to fit them in so the doors would close. It would have helped if the staff would have known which vehicles fit 3 carseats. The staff had changed my vehicle from my reservation request which caused more issues.<//Text>< pictures>

Absolutely marvelous experience.
I got a Toyota Corolla with quite a few scratches here and there, but otherwise in great condition. Key points that made renting a car here a pleasure:
* they don't discriminate drivers aged 21-24, as other car rentals do,
* very reasonable pricing
* unlimited mileage included (restricted to California & Nevada)
* when I returned the car 3 days early, they gave me a refund without any problem,
* no problem with deposit return,</Review>

I've rented now from Super Cheap Car Rental in Millbrae about 4 times in 2018. Each time the processing of the rental agreement , selection of vehicles , pick up and drop off has been very easy. The staff has always been accommodating and clear in the pick up and drop off rules. The cars are generally no frills , but mechanically sound and clean and the value is unparalleled for rentals near around SFO. I encourage anyone needing a rental car in this areas to use Super Cheap Car Rental.-JK</review>

Awesome rental car company! $40 for a days ride in a new Hyundai Elantra -- it was sparkling clean and the paperwork was straight forward. After hours drop off was made simple, I'd recommend these guys anyday. No mileage limits and they were nice enough to lend us a USB adapter for the car. Thanks Super Cheap Rental!<//Text>

After having a rental experience, I realized why there have been so many good reviews. The price is way better, close enough from Airport (and from Millbrae BART station) and I really liked the way it was processed. Everything is exactly what was shown on the webpage. Great service and staffs.<//Text>

<username>Anony Mous</username><time>1359770820123</time><rating>5<//rating><text>I flew in just for one night for work and chose this car rental place since it was the cheapest rate. But their service was 5 stars, not only did they pick me up within 10 minutes when I called, I noticed the day after that they also emailed me asking if I needed to be picked up. Also I accidentally locked the keys in the rental car. So when I gave them a call they offered to come by to open it for "FREE." When I was waiting for them to come a police officer offered to open my vehicle with a Slim Jim, the officer was able to open it before the rental car came. So when they arrived I felt bad asking them to come there to help so when I offered a gratuity they declined it and stated it wasn't a problem. I guarantee there is not another car rental service that would have done that for free and arrive within 20 minutes to help.   So if your going to visit San Fransisco and need a rental car by all means use them.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I started to rent their car on a holiday. Normally they don't work on holiday, but the operator decided to help me. I called him at the airport car rental center and he came to pick me up in 5 minutes. Very nice and facetious man!

Some days later they also helped to provide documents for my DMV test. Those documents were sent to me via email, so I didn't have to go to their office 40 miles away! Then I successfully got a CA license. I really appreciate their help!

Before I returned the car I intentionally made a hand palm sized scratch on the right side rear door😓 I was very sorry about that, and had prepared for the compensation. But they said it's OK and I don't have to pay anything. It's really out of my expectation.

I rented their car for more than 2 months. I prepaid the first month. When the rental expired they called me and conducted the money, while I didn't have to go to their office for the extension. This is much more convenient than Alamo. In Alamo you you can maximumly rent for 1 month, then you have to go back to their office to extend the rental, and you can not extend it by phone call.

Overall, this is really a good rental company and will be my first recommendation for my friends come to SF.< /Text><rate>5< /rate><date>1456475440759<//date><username>Yun Wu<//username>< pics>

I have rented cars 4 times from super cheap car rentals, during a time when I first moved out to SF. At first I was a little skeptical about what to expect. However, I soon realized that these guys were truly a service oriented team. The company is run by the owner (steve) and a small team of 2 (jessica and other young guy). Every time I rented a car from them I got was I was offered, never did I have to argue over the car, or the rate. They always looked out for me, and ensure that I was okay with my rental. Its a small team so don't expect the traditional 5 star service, you must be flexible, but they really go the extra mile. I would absolutely recommend anyone a budget to rent cars from super cheap car rentals.< /Text>

I accidentally booked a rental car out of this location.  They were great in helping me cancel my appointment without worrying about excess fees.  Thanks, Guys!!!< /Review>

Exelent service, pricing is fair for under 25. Cars are in good condition. If I need to rent a car I will go there again.</Text>

Great customer service with pick up from and drop off at SFO.  Great prices and cars.  Limited hours so best for someone looking to pick up the car during the week M-F.  I will be renting from them again.</Review>

<Response>None<//Response><userid>108834497516703506170< /userid><Text>I have rented cars 4 times from super cheap car rentals, during a time when I first moved out to SF. At first I was a little skeptical about what to expect. However, I soon realized that these guys were truly a service oriented team. The company is run by the owner (steve) and a small team of 2 (jessica and other young guy). Every time I rented a car from them I got was I was offered, never did I have to argue over the car, or the rate. They always looked out for me, and ensure that I was okay with my rental. Its a small team so don't expect the traditional 5 star service, you must be flexible, but they really go the extra mile. I would absolutely recommend anyone a budget to rent cars from super cheap car rentals.<//Text><Name>Jesus Lara<//Name></record>

Really nice staff, great car rental company. They picked me up from the SFO airport and got me on my way, super straight forward!

We got a reliable car, cheap on gas, Toyato Carolla, great way to see the beautiful California.

Thanks Super Cheap, 5 stars, we had an awesome time!<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Very satisfied with the result.  Once we were at baggage claim and got our luggage, all I had to do was call them and they picked my wife and I up at the airport and took us back to their office to do the paper work.  We were a little skeptical at first because it was much cheaper than anything else in the area for car rental and we didn't know what to expect, but we got a nice, clean 07' corrolla.  Which was about standard for what other places offered, but a few hundred less.  We did get a flat tire, but it was due to running over a nail.  The owner was pretty cool about it and though it clearly states that all renters are responsible for tire repairs in the paperwork, he agreed to go in on half with me.  Later, when we dropped off the car, he changed his mind and reimbursed me for the full amount, which was really great because he truly didn't have to do anything since it was our problem and the rules were clearly stated out.  Last than, they were able to drop us back off at the airport so even though they aren't technically located at SFO, they go above and beyond making sure you don't have any hassel getting to them.  Overall, great experience.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Inexpensive ($21 all-in for one day) and a low mileage clean, new Nissan Sentra. They are across the street from the parking lot for the Millbrae BART and CalTrain station. A pleasure not to use the SFO Airport car rental facility with all of it rip-off facility use charges. As others have noted, no sign for the agency but the address is painted on the building. Once inside the building, the office is easy to find, and all the late model Nissans and Toyotas in the parking lot are an obvious tip-off. We had arrived the prior night late at the airport and stayed at the Aloft SFO hotel, which is also next to the Westin. Both of these hotels are within walking distance (7-10 minutes), but be careful as it this is not a very pedestrian friendly neighborhood with a narrow sidewalk over the 101 freeway; you have to cross the freeway on-ramps and one on-ramp is not protected by a light. Despite a painted crosswalk, cars were busy speeding up to get on the freeway, not slowing down for the few pedestrians.  This is a low overhead business, not open on Sundays, limited hours, etc. but I found the rental process efficient and it worked for us. Will consider using them again in the future.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The rate breakdown is very easy to understand. You can rest assured that there are no excessive insurance recommendations. The clerk is very friendly and has nothing to say! Thank you for coming to San Francisco Airport. I will use it again next time!

In addition, the store clerk at the return location was also very good response! I sent it to LAX Airport free of charge. Thank you very much!

料金内訳が非常にわかりやすいです。過剰な保険のレコメンドもなく安心できます。店員さんは非常にフレンドリーで言うことありません！サンフランシスコ空港まで迎えにきて頂き感謝しております。次回もここを利用させていただきます！

また返却場所のロサンゼルスの店員さんも同じく非常に良い対応でした！LAX空港まで無料で送って頂きました。ありがとうございました！</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Excellent service and hospitality. Steve, the manager, kindly picked me up from my hotel located 2 km from the agency. I left less than 30 minutes later. You do not choose your car but for the price which includes insurance and unlimited mileage, nothing to complain about. My car was a white Toyota Corolla, a reliable car and not too fuel efficient.

Excellent service et accueil. Steve, le gérant, est gentiment venu me chercher à mon hôtel situé à 2 km de l'agence. Je suis parti moins de 30 minutes après. On ne choisit pas sa voiture mais pour le prix qui comprend assurance et kilométrage illimité, pas de quoi se plaindre. Ma voiture était une Toyota Corolla blanche, une voiture fiable et pas trop gourmande en essence.</review><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

Everything anyone should want in a studio. Great teachers, great floor, great atmosphere from the staff and dancers. Not cheap, but reasonable prices. Worth every penny (and possibly the effort to get there).< /Text>

Rented this space to practice with a group and it was clean, spacious, and very private. I wish there was a bigger sign out front. Trust the gps.<//review>

Been to a bunch of studios across the city. The instructors here are the best by far. Great diversity in styles and the atmosphere is super welcoming. Couldn't recommend it more.< /Text>

My first time at Kinjaz Dojo. I've been trying to find time to take some classes here, but work is always in the way. I went for an Ori Tahitian dance class. It's a cool spot. Very chill and welcoming. I'll be back.< /review>

The coolest place ever!!!! When you enter the Dojo, you feel a sense of warmth and happiness. Everyone is there to learn new things and most important to dance and enjoy the time. I will be definitely going back to learn some new things from the dancers who inspire me the most.< /Text>

<Review>One of the best places to take dance classes in LA. Wide variety of teachers, you can check the schedule on somebody or (more reliably) their Instagram.

I've never been to this place but I wish I could be there. I saw kinjaz dojo youtube channel where they post dance video and it was awesome. I wish I could dance with Anthony Lee because he is a chill and funny man plus his dance moves are best. Respect to all dancer in the kinjaz dojo. I'm out!< /text>

< review>
Writing a review right after a bad experience can sometimes “bite” you later but since it’s been 2 years since my first and last visit here I think it’s fair to leave a review. Now, first let me start with saying this place has gnarly technology. It’s clean and has updated equipment. Owning all the bells and whistles is only a small piece of the puzzle, the integrity is the main part. I’m like most humans on earth who take care of their teeth but could always do more flossing. With that being said, I have never had a cavity, crown, or anything other than braces back in the day. During my initial visit here I was told I had numerous cavities and was presented with a $3000 plan towards healthier teeth. The worst part was that I didn’t even have the cleaning done at all so I was charged essentially for x-rays... cool... not. I did forward those x-rays to a friend and advised that there were no known issues with my teeth so I decided to opt out of any further business with this practice. I just think it’s so unprofessional to work up an invoice when there is no need. It’s like taking a car into the shop and even when everything is smooth they want to add on hundreds of dollars to replace this or that. That’s how I felt this place conducts business... just like a mechanic shop. Sad. Save your money and seek out another dentist. Your teeth and wallet will thank you.< /review>

This was by far the best experience I’ve had at a dentist appointment. The office is so clean and modern and the staff is really kind. I hate the dentist and am usually really nervous but Dr. Almario was so kind and really thorough. Even If you hate the dentist you will love this place!</text>

<Date>1620523741397< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I finally have my molar crown after having a painful
root canal at my upper right molar.
Dr. Almario is now my go to dentist.
I will highly recommend her as she is very kind and respectful.
Her office is very clean and great atmosphere.
The staff are very nice and I really appreciate their hospitality.
I chose her because of her ratings and also is
within 2 miles from home.
I had made three appointments with her.
The first appointment was having a referral to a Endodontic Doctor for a root canal treatment.
My second appointment was for my temporary molar crown placement.
My third appointment was for my molar crown placement.
All this was within 1.5 month including the Endodontic doctor.
Overall I am satisfied with the procedure and I am eating
well with no discomfort or other abnormal symptoms.
I created future appointment with her for general check
and soon I will be following up with her for fillings.
I been paying cash and I was expecting a lot more
but is not. At least with me.
I have spend $1,250.00 for my upper molar crown In two separate payments. Regardless of the price, I am very satisfied but now I am more aware and care for oral hygene and cutting down the sugars.
More than Five stars to Dr. Almario and the staff.
Thank you very much and I look forward for more treatments.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>The best dentist I’ve ever been to! The staff is so friendly and Dr. Almario really knows what she’s doing.  I’ve had problems with fillings in the past that caused years of pain, and she created a filling for me that feels like it’s not even there! Thank you so much!</Review>< Pictures>

Loved my experience at Dr. Almario’s office. Great staff, well greeted from when you walk in till you leave. Very cautious and clean with the pandemic going on. Not forgetting they make you feel as comfortable as they can with T.V and a cover pillow. Highly recommend this dental office, they are a great team.<//Text>

Dr Almario is the BEST! Everything about her office is perfect- it’s an efficient process, clean and there are TVs on the ceiling so you can distract yourself during cleanings. Her staff are all so kind and great at their jobs! I can’t recommend her enough!!<//review>

Dr. Almario is excellent. Great technical skills and lovely bedside manner. I’ve had a lot of complicated dental work done over many years and she is the best dentist I’ve ever had. She is highly competent and never tries to get me to do work I don’t really need. I’ve recommended several people to her and they all love her!< /text>

Dr. Almario is an excellent dentist, and has made excellent recommendations when I have needed further work. She is swift and gentle, always attentive during her work. Her staff is kind and attentive, and they make their work very personal to me — always checking in and ensuring the work done feels good and that I have everything I need. The office is also lovely and offers television in each room, which really helps pass the time during a longer appointment. I would highly recommend Efma Almario to anyone looking for gentle, honest, personalized dentistry. 😁<//text>

Front desk went above and beyond to help me figure out if my dental insurance was covered at the office. Dental hygienist gave me probably the best cleaning I’ve ever had to date very noticeably thorough and the doctor made me feel comfortable and was very pleasant to work with regarding my treatment plan. Would highly recommend :)<//Review>

<text>Just had first visit- staff was friendly and put me at ease. I saw a different dentist than Efma, but she was very professional and, because I have not been taking adequate care of my teeth, she found a lot of problems. She did a thorough exam, then drew up a treatment plan for all of my dental issues. The only reason for four-star review was that I don't have enough information to fully review the dentist.<//text>< pics>

Ummm, this place is AMAZING!! Brenda and Michelle were outstanding in their professionalism but also making you feel like a friend and at home! The facility is state of the art, including TVs to watch while you’re getting worked on, Dr Almario is the SWEETEST! A true pro with a sensitive touch! Best part of it all was that my insurance covered almost everything! Thanks so much for the INCREDIBLE Experience and can’t wait to come back and get my cavities filled!!!!! Haha< /review>

I've been going to Dr. Efma Almario for nearly a year now. I've been getting cosmetic dental work done in order to achieve a beautiful smile, yet keep it functional. Throughout the entire process Dr. Efma Almario has been wonderful. She made sure I was well informed before starting the procedure, and consulted with other experts in her field to make sure we would achieve the best results. She's a dedicated and well skilled dentist who truly cares for her patients. Whenever I had a dental emergency she had me come-in, during or after business hours. She does whatever it takes to make sure all inconveniences are been taken care off as soon as possible. The office has always been clean and the staff has been amazing. Brenda, who works in the office, has been my go-to person in case I needed second opinions, which I'm very grateful for. Dr. Efma Almario has done an amazing job, and I couldn't be more happy and thankful to her, and her talented team.< /Text>

I have been going to Dr. Almario for over 15 years, and I will never ever leave her. She is so expert and kind and gentle, that I actually look forward to my dental visits. She has completely redefined what it’s like to go to the dentist, turning what used to be an experience filled with dread, into an occasion that’s surprisingly downright pleasurable. Her office staff is wonderful and their facilities are quite comfortable. Kudos, Salutes and Thanks to Dr. Efma Almario Dentistry. You should try her. You’ll never look back.</Text>

<Review>I can't imagine a dentist's office being any better! Dr. Almario is a joy to see. I've been going to this office for almost 10 years and it's always a painless and positive experience and the staff is always friendly and kind. Highly, highly recommend going here!< /Review>< gmapID>

Dr. Almario is a very kind and skilled Dentist that I will be bringing my child to when he is old enough.  Excellent care with a warm atmosphere that takes the terror out of going to the dentist. 5 Stars all day!< /review>

< Review>
What a change to find an honest, genuine dentist who really cares about her patients and her work. The Staff are warm and friendly and the dentist was gentle and very reassuring. She took her time and seems to enjoy her work. I am mid treatment so so far so good she has done a wonderful job.< /Review>

< Review>
I have been so ashamed of my smile for so long, covering my mouth when I laughed, that when Dr. Efma fixed me and handed me the mirror I burst into tears of joy. We have a ways to go still but what she’s already done is truly amazing</Review>

The staff is terrific, very sensitive to the patient needs. The office has a very soothing environment if you are nervous about seeing the dentist. The patient education is thorough and the doctor really takes the time to answer any questions. I have never waited more than a few minutes to be seen.< /text>

<review>Found this place on my insurance provider's website - listed as covered by my plan. Scheduled an appointment a month and a half in advance and gave my insurance info over the phone. Was called the day before and gave my insurance info again. When I finally showed up, the person at the desk told me my insurance wouldn't cover anything, but that they would be glad to have me pay out of pocket for everything. You couldn't tell me that a month and a half before, or even the day before? Thanks for wasting my time to try and make a buck! Shady place.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Beautiful Grove of Redwoods with very little traffic. If you're not going any further north consider my review 5 stars but there are some real giants about 15 minutes north in the state park.</text>

<review>Very tiny parking area, but a very nice park. Plenty of walking area. I confused this place for a different place I visited last time I was in the area, but it was well worth it!

Just a friendly reminder: Please! Clean up after yourself if you visit any park.

I did NOT see any bathrooms.
Looked like a birthday party was going on in the front area (flat grassy patch) by the road.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x54d48e894bfd62db:0x1a7f4c834aef4f7<//Gmap_id>< time>

The central place of redwood national park. Plenty of hikes, spots, stops, trees and mind blowing scenery. There is also the visitor center and many many pullover spot to enjoy the view and take pictures as well< /Text>

Gorgeous little walk. Great first stop along the Avenue of Giants. Good place to see some giant trees both standing and fallen. A nice location for photographs. There is a place for trash and a few picnic tables. Only service dogs are allowed on the trail.<//review>

Beautiful hiking trails and area. These trees are amazing. Parking is on site and there are bathrooms at the visitor centers. Be careful for the poison oak and be sure to stay on trails because it is everywhere.</text>

To really enjoy the Avenue of the Giants, leave Hwy 101 for about 30 miles of Hwy 254 and take your time to visit the many hiking and scenic areas, and quaint towns that parallel 101. There are at least 8 freeway access points for camping, hiking and picnicking areas, so you can make the excursion as long as you like!</review>

If you haven't done the Avenue of the Giants tour. It is really an amazing trip. So many awesome things to learn and see.  The red wood car was definitely a sight to see.< /text>

Absolutely spectacular. We just pulled off the avenue of the giants on a whim and had a fifteen minute stroll around being stunned by how amazing nature is. I don't think you can possibly do justice to groves of mature Redwoods in writing. Wonderful!< /Review>

This was a beautiful walk through the Redwoods. The sign says it only takes 15 minutes, we took much longer taking pictures and wandering about on the side trails. Such a peaceful place. Almost missed the plaque as it's hiding behind a large fallen tree.< /Text>

Dr. Abousaif is wonderful. He listens intently, reassures patients, believes in them, and knows how to do procedures gently. My first colonoscopy I wanted no drugs, and I felt no pain. He talked me through it while I watched the procedure on the screen. I highly recommend him if you have any hesitancy about colonoscopies or endoscopies.<//Text>

Excellent care. Staff is attentive, personal and professional. Dr Abousaif is not only a great doctor but makes sure patients are well taken care of.
The fact that he remembered details of my treatment from 4 years ago without looking at my chart, was very impressive.< /Text>

My only issue is that the office is terribly busy and it takes a long time to hear back from anyone or if you’re out of refills you may have to call them yourself once or twice. There is a patient portal which is nice. However, I recommend putting in your message with plenty of time in advance because it takes someone 3 and sometimes more days to get back to you. You do get the info about your appointment really quickly on the portal though. I recommend Dr. Abousaif as very knowledgeable and caring.< /text>< pics>

They are polite when you can get ahold of them, but getting a person or a return call back is a joke.  I tried 6 times over 5 days to refill a prescription with NO luck.  They need better phone service!<//text>

I was referred to Dr. Abousaif for my chronic acid reflex. I was had an apt and he recommended an endoscopy. I was very nervous to have this procedure done. We did it and it was easy. Dr. Abousaif put me on a prescription and my acid reflex is no longer a problem. I cant believe how kind he is, patient and doesn't rush the appointment. I have referred so many friends to him, because he is truly a caring doctor.</text>

I’m glad I took her recommendation because Dr. Abousaif was very personable, very caring and made you feel very comfortable talking about uncomfortable medical topics, I.e., colonoscopy.

While waiting for my procedure, he came by and explained what the process was and reassured me that all should go well and I’m happy to say, it did.  Immediately after the procedure, he shared his findings with me and the end result of how he addressed it. Dr. Abousaif is very professional and very thorough.

I highly recommend Dr. Abousaif as he is an amazing person and most importantly, a wonderful physician.<//Review>< Pics>

I had some lower intestinal problems, the kind that you don't often speak about to friends and neighbors. I went to Dr Abousaif as a recommendation and it paid off in relief and an absence of fear about the unknown of my physical condition.
Dr Abousaif's office, office staff and aids were all professional, understanding and truly compassionate concerning me and my condition.
I highly recommend Dr Abousaif and his office.</Review>

During the follow up procedure he reported the result and the follow up plan. He is friendly took the time to make you feel at ease. It’s really important to have the colonoscopy and endoscopy as a routine test, most specially when you are 50 years old. It should be included in your screening test. It saved a life of my love ones, he undergone this test and caught colon cancer at an early stage. It is a very important screening test for colon cancer.</review><user_id>104188397838155193206</user_id><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>My family and I met Dr.Abousaif when my mother in law became his patient. She is completely monolingual so all the kids were present from beginning to end. Dr Abousaif was patient explaining to us every detail about her case, her procedure and after care. He allowed to translate and ask questions. He made her  and us feel safe and cared for. So when when I needed to see a gastroenterologist, there was no doubt I was choosing Dr. Abousaif. From the begging he has shown true concern for me. When i was diagnosed with colon cancer, he immediately referred me to an oncologist , within 2 weeks of my diagnosis I had surgery, and within 6 days i got my results. I was cancer free. He has been seeing me for check ups n my annual colonoscopies. Every appointment he takes his time explaining what he is looking for, what will be occurring, and asking me what my concerns might be. Every procedure he has performed, he always checks in on me before. Again to answer any questions I may have. To inform me of what he will be doing, his staff also come by such as nurse and anesthesiologists to introduce themselves and let me know what their role will be. After procedure he checks back to see how i feel, relate any findings, or like in my last meeting 8/21/20 to give me great news. Still Cancer free! 4 years now. I feel very lucky to have Dr. Abousaif be my doctor. I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking  a talented and caring gastroenterologist.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd9c4e0516025:0xe58e304d93c2c99<//gmapID></record>

You could not ask for a better Doctor he makes you feel so comfortable & explains everything in detail. For anyone contemplating about getting a colonoscopy don't it saved my life. Dr Abousaif has performed over 4 on me & each time he removed many polyps.

All his Staff & the Staff at La Veta Surgery Center are Fantastic I am so thankful to have Dr Abousaif as my Dr. he cares so much about all his patients & he is the Best Doctor you could ask for.

Thank you Dr Abousaif

I had a colonoscopy with Dr. Abousaif.  His facility on W La Veta ave in Orange was nice, clean, pleasant.

The office staff and medical staff were professional, caring and efficient.  Wait time was minimum.

Dr. Abousaif performed the colonoscopy with only sedatives, not general anesthesia.  The procedure was quick and painless. I was able to walk out the door for the ride to go home, but the staff insisted to wheel me out in a wheelchair.

Overall I would highly recommend Dr. Abousaif for his professional competence, the efficiency and high quality care of his organization and the high quality of the facility.<//Review>

Dr. Abousaif and his staff are great.  Booking an appointment was easy and quick.  I saw him for a consult for a routine preventative colonoscopy.  Booking the procedure was also easy and the staff explained what to expect in detail.  The outpatient facility (InSite Orange) for the procedure was welcoming and clean.  In and out in less than a few hours for my procedure.  Nurses and staff were very nice.   Follow up visit with Dr. Abousaif was good.  He explained what he found during procedure and gave his recommendations.  He listened to my concerns and answered all questions.  I didn't feel rushed at all.  Thank you Dr. Abousaif!< /Text>

< Review>
Dr. Abousaif was extremely communicative. He kept me informed about each step of the procedure. His staff was very clear about the prep and post procedures. Together, they made an unpleasant experience tolerable. I don't look forward to the next colonoscopy but certainly will be going back to these people for their professional care.</Review>

Dr. Abousaif was very helpful and considerate.  The staff is also very efficient and kind.  Dr. Abousaif performed an endoscopy procedure and it went smoothly, with him being very upfront about all that was done, keeping informed and easing any concerns I had.  I highly recommend him and his staff.</text>

The staff is great here. Super friendly and they go out of their way to help and answer questions. I loved Dixie and Dr. A is very nice as well. The only downside is that they are popular, so you need to have a little patience regarding your appointment time. They usually running 30 minutes behind.<//review>

<review>I would like to thank Dr Abousaif and staff for outstanding health care. His abilities as a medical specialist and surgeon are the best in his profession. As well he has the great  ability to hire the best talented office and surgical team. They are a first class team which makes the experience so smooth and unstressful. I am 62 yrs old with a family history of colon cancer. Two times every three years I have had cancerous polyps removed successfully. I am healthy now and don’t need a follow up for 5 yrs. Dr Abousaif and staff have allowed me to continue quality in life, and age gracefully. Many many thanks.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1519157400429, 'text': 'Thank you for the high star rating and kind comment. Thank you for clearly describing your experience.

I had a couple of procedures with Dr. Abousaif, both satisfactory, but I was most impressed by his friendly manner, and follow up with me and my wife. I would highly recommend him to anyone of need of his services.

Dr. Abousaif and his team are the best very professional my procedure was painless and very quick, didn’t know what to expect was first time getting colonoscopy, Dr. Abousaif and his team made me feel so comfortable before and after the procedure.  It is so comforting knowing when I need to have this procedure done again will be in good hands with Dr. Abousaif and his team.<//Review>

Dr Abousaif is wonderful, he takes his time with you, answers your questions, talks to you so you understand everything. He has done several procedures on me and is very good at telling you what he's going to do, what he's looking for and what he may have to do if a problem arises so that there are no surprises. He's very knowledgeable in his field and I would not want to see any other gastroenterologist.< /review>

I had an opportunity to do an observer-ship under Abusaif MD. He is very professional, courteous and 100% committed to his job. Patients love him and he is a very knowledgeable person. He takes the time to listen and explains everything clearly and in simple understandable language to the patients.< /Text>

<review>Found it again in the food truck in front of O'Malley's sports bar on old Middlefield about a block up from Rengsdorff. Still delicious! Fewer menu items but they had my favorite grilled chicken super burrito and the staff is still very nice.</review>< Pics>

This is the best taqueria in the Bay area hands down I've lived here for all 30 years of my life and yet to find something better. The pandemic has significantly hurt their business and you all should go eat there and support them!< /Text>

Hard to find these guys now as they’re in a taco truck labeled Paper Platez outside of the O’Malley’s pub but it’s really La Bamba Taqueria and it’s GREAT! Super burritos were nummy and so were the queso biria tacos *drool*...</Text>

Great tacos and friendly service. They sometimes have a bounce house so very family oriented.</Text>

Still really good after all these years but just hard to pay $10 for a regular burrito but when you're located down the street from Google maybe that is the way it's is...<//review>

<review>Terrible service. Food was barely warm and just wasn't what I thought it would be after reading the reviews. Neighborhood spot? Maybe but I would rather travel elsewhere to spend my money for hot food and at least friendly... welcoming service and decent prices! NEVER again!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Good food in large, nicely appointed restaurant. Has outdoor seating. Large menu selection, including breakfast burritos. Good selection of meat choices each with good flavors (at least, for those I've tried). Friendly staff and plenty of parking outside.<//Text><time>1509843309712</time>< user_name>

Great authentic food with a large sized indoor dining area with an additional large area for outside seating for groups and family. My orders here is made fresh and quick right in front of my eyes. I’m a pescatarian so I usually get the fish tacos or shrimp tacos. The portions are generous and flavorful.< /Review>

<Text>Place is a bit slow and cleanliness is a bit skeptic. Portions are really filling and it is more value than chipotle. However I think I prefer Chipotles taste. I ordered simmering chicken burrito. It was just ok.

Pros:
Large portion
Cons
A bit slow< /Text>< Time>

<Review>Great place for Mexican cuisine! We are their customers since almost 20 years ago and they never disappoint! We usually get the super burritos with carne asada from them, but today I tried the shrimp tacos and they're so yummy too (but more on the "light" side than the burritos, which in my opinion are like the meal for a whole day)! Highly recommend trying this restaurant (we usually get take-out, even before corona time, to eat there is ok but not very fancy LOL)!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>One of the last truly great burritos to be had. There are two keys to nailing a good super burrito: First, always fry the meat a little on the grill for each order so it’s hot and fresh, not lukewarm and greasy out of the warming tray. Second, put the cheese separate from the salsa and other cold ingredients - I don’t know many people that like cold, wet cheese. Personally I ask them to put it first on the tortilla and then put the rice, because melted cheesy tortilla rice is the bomb. They always nail it! Don’t settle for Chipotle, come here and try the real thing.< /Text></record>

< Review>
I know that with Covid 19, there’s a lot of people not working. So when I went into La bamba today, I noticed ONE cook and a lady taking orders/ helping put it together.
We got home with our order, the burrito had no taste, super stale flavor, it was one of the worst burritos I’ve EVER HAD. We got shrimp tacos and those were not even seasoned, the tortilla ripped when I was gonna pick up and take a bite because of how soggy it was. OHH!! And the nachos... those nachos (smh). Uggh. I should’ve just grabbed a bag of chips on their own.

I’m sorry but today, we were hoping for some delicious food, but man this place disappointed BIG TIME. We’ve been here before, and usually food is good. But today was just a flat out disappointment. WASTE OF MONEY!!!<//Review>

It is not 100% Mexican food, but also Salvadorian food. The fish and shrimp tacos weren't very good because they have few meet, a lot of vegetables and the tortillas were wet too. The drinks are very expensive compared with the size they give you and they don't offer refill. I only liked the Super Nachos and the tamarind water. Finally, the guy who took the order, wasn't very polite.<//review>

La Bamba used to be legendary. It's still good, but not good enough to make the drive from SF. Good place for kids, with the bouncy house.< /text>

This place is amazing. Great food. Fun for the family. They even have a bouncy house our back for “kids” on weekends.

Pro Tip: The Tamales are SO good!< /text>

Ok last call burrito before closing, luke warm and a disappointment...

... A $12 burrito should be pretty awesome...

The web site said it was $7.50...  It's pretty good at that price, but for $12...
😟

A $12-14 burrito Should list at least $$ or $$$, but glad to grab a meal of opportunity outta there...< /review>

<text>I've visited dozens of Mexican/Salvadoran restaurants and this is by far the worst. The place was clean, service was ok even though the cashier was not friendly, but all is over shadowed by the food. The steak was dry, no flavor at all, beans were watery and bitter. And then the worst, the pupusas, those flat corn circles should not be called pupusas, is just offensive. The price does not reflect on the quality of the food. There 10 times better options in the Bay Area.</text>< UserId.>

Solid taqueria! I'd easily give it 4/5 if the food quality was consistent. It's never bad and at times it's even great. That being said it tends to be slightly the salty side especially if you add the salsa.

On the weekends it has a bounce house kids which is always a plus.

Wait staff is always friendly!!!!!< /Review>

<review>Standard taqueria fare. Oddly, they serve white rice instead of Spanish. Large servings, even the shrimp dish. Burritos are large enough to sate the hungriest of appetites. I did not see any stand out dishes. Staff is friendly and attentive. Plenty of informal seating with a large outdoor seating area.<//review><Name>Shane Fitzgibbons</Name></record>

<Text>Mexican and Salvadorian food cuisine!
Some of my friends have made comments that it's not "authentic"...regardless of authenticity, I know I enjoy the food every time I come!
A little pricey, but there are a lot of options to choose from and various drinks to choose from.
This is a spot I hit up during football season and also there's a jump castle in the back, very family friendly.
And a lot of space inside and outside in the back.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Wow! What can I say. I just suffered through the worst, "Get out of my restaurant, and never come back again" burrito I've ever eaten in my life. Chicken was dry. Lots of crispy burnt bits, that I at first assumed were bacon. But, alas, no -- too tasteless.  Just burnt bits of chicken and rice.  When something is this bad, it can only be incompetence, extreme indifference, or willful malevolence. Amazing, because I used to really like the food at this place. But, if you really don't want me to come back this badly, I'm happy to oblige you. Adios.</text>

So we reordered our food. She told us it would take about 5 minutes, rush ordering it. At this point there was a line of people waiting for their food. I saw my food being made right in front of me. I asked for no sour cream, but clearly saw the cook put sour cream in my food. Then they put my food on the side. Continued making food for the other people waiting and called them all one by one, until I was the last one there and noticed that the chef was no longer cooking food. Walked back up to the cashier and asked if that was my food. She grabbed it and said yes. I requested that it be recooked because it had been sitting there for a quite a long time and they never called me to grab it from the counter. The manager, maybe owner (the older lady that works there) came up and just automatically assumed that she knew what had happened. Very firmly suggested that my food had just been made, which it obviously hadn't. I then told her I also saw them put sour cream on it. She looked at the receipt, as if that were going to do anything, and said we wrote no sour cream. Instead of fussing about it and causing more of a scene, I decided to just take the food and leave. Got home. Food was cold. Food had sour cream in it. Couldn't eat it due to food allergies. The manager lady should really learn that customers come first, or at least listen to them before coming at them assuming she knows what's right, when she very obviously had no clue. I even heard the chef say that he would remake it when I requested for our food to be recooked, and she just completely ignored him as if she didn't hear him. Very unsatisfied with the way she handled the whole situation and should've at least apologized. So this review is mostly aimed towards her.</text></record></dataset><record>

Still the best mexican food around with lots of indoor and outdoor seating. We like to go on the weekends with our kids as they inflate a large bounce house. Then we can relax and have some adult conversation on the outdoor patio. Highly recommend anything with their pollo asado which is crispy on the outside and still juicy on the inside.</Review>

<review>Great burritos. Carnitas was excellent, the super burrito was very large. If the burrito ingredients were mixed a little better it would have been perfect.

Only real negative was no free chips and salsa. I will definitely be going back to try their other meats and also the tamales.< /review>< Pics>

My favorite El Salvadorian spot on the Peninsula! I always get the Quesadilla Zuiza, but the burritos and tacos are great too. The meat is always cooked perfectly. For more traditional fair, get the Pupusas or Sopes, they are delicious. Free chips and salsa. Three kinds of hot sauce: rojo is my favorite, very unique and perfectly spicy, the verde is refreshing and mild, the tomatillo (also red in color) is tart, and mild...try them all.

Best burritos ever. Came back to town and had to visit here for their super burrito with chicken. Been going here for years and quality is always outstanding and the product is always consistent. Simply put, you always know what you're getting, and it never disappoints.<//text>

Got my order wrong again. Ordered number two with grilled chicken and added sour cream. Simple right? Nope, got order home and it was NOT grilled chicken and there was no sour cream.  But they sure charged me for it. The quality of the staff and food has really gone downhill since they used to be on Middlefield Rd. Burritos used to be juicy and flavorful. Now they're all dry and bland/tasteless.< /Text>

Don't ever waste your time here if you're an African American. As soon 🔜 as I walked in the door the cook told order taker not to serve me in Spanish.

So this young man took well over 10 minutes to take my order with dirty looks in the process. So please don't waste your time with bigots at this establishment.</review>

This place has been around forever but about 3 years ago it moved to the other side of the street.  The location is new, but rest assured it is the same high quality food.  I strongly recommend the super burrito!<//Text>

<Text>One of the few authentic tasting Mexican joints in Mountain View. Plenty of plate and a la carte options, including some non-Mexican such as pupusas. Restaurant is clean and quiet. Even during busy times food is served within 10 mins. Staff is very hospitable and friendly. The patio area has a relaxing atmosphere with bounce house which my kids enjoy while the adults talk. The horchata beverage is pretty spot on.</Text>< user_name>

Carnitas burritos and tacos very dry, taste like grinded up pork jerky rolled up in a tortilla with  cilantro beans and rice. What happened? It use to taste so good when they were on old middlefield, large crowds now the place is empty.</text>

Super Burritos are excellent. They really don't get any better in flavor and portion size. I'm an adult and I usually finish 2/3 at one sitting. My kids love the Papusas (I've never tried them).<//review>

Food is ok, like every other Mexican in this area. We liked to go there because of the bouncing castle, however today they refused to turn it on for us. Instead of telling us that at the beginning, she kept saying in a few minutes- very disappointing for my two year old son!<//Review>

The worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life. I might be a little bias because I am a chef, but one thing I know after living in California for over 30 years is good Mexican food. I will give it to them yes they cooked the meat fresh but the forgot the most important thing and one of the cheapest ingredients on the market.....Salt! Latin people are known for the amazing and robust flavors. La Bamba was a major let down, I walked away from full plates of food and could care less to ask for my money back. Maybe they can keep it to by some salt....oh yea almost forgot they over cooked my flautas to the point the meat was dry and burnt....major dissatisfaction!</text>

Burritos are  good. The biggest problem I have with the place is inconsistency in terms of quantity and quality. They also tend to be very rude.< /text>

<review>Good burritos.

The opening hours are approximate. I showed up at 10 for a breakfast burrito but had to come back in half an hour. They don't seem to post hours anywhere.</review>< Pictures>

I've been here several times. The food is always good, but rather expensive ($15 for a flautas plate). The location is also great. The interior is quite bare and uninviting. The staff also starts cleaning long before closing time, making you feel a little unwelcome.</review>

You get some chips and salsa with you order but have to ask for it, it's not automatic.
Next time I want to try some special grilled chicken that my friend had in a taco, it looks good.

This used to be one of our favorite spots for takeout, but the menu had narrowed, and the prices increased since their location on Old Middlefield closed.

The food is still good and quite different from the Mexican places in the area (they are Salvadoran IIRC), but isn't a great deal at the price. We still eat here on occasion, but used to do so more often.</review>

I really prefer tacquerias that make me feel as if I was in Mexico right then eating the taco. This place was almost there. Almost. Their horchata tastes a bit watered down too.<//text>

Great food. Their carnitas is amazing. I really enjoy the carnitas california burrito or the quesadilla zuiza. If you get burritos or quesadillas, ask them to not put salsa in them, as they make them too watery.< /review>

Biting into a Super Burrito is a surreal experience. On the outside you'll see what appears to be a normal mexican burrito, but upon biting you realize... O_o this is amazing! The perfectly packed, heated up, tender, and moist shrimp burrito is the best decision you'll make all day.

Prices are bit higher than Chipotle, but portion sizes are good. In fact, rookies, go easy on the consumption. Don't be trapped by eating a too many of those free chips and pico de gallo---the burrito is the centerpiece. Careful trying to conquer the mountain of eating the whole burrito and ending up in a food coma. Best to save that last third and walk out still functioning.

Of the other La Bamba's in the area, this location reigns supreme.<//review>

The super burrito is good but expensive and isn't anything you couldn't get somewhere else. Also, there was quite a wait for food. Overall, okay experience.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The place is clean and the food is very rich. I have visited the Rincon Sabroso and I can say that the Bamba is the best food and there are many tables and you can sit outside to eat too.
