< Review>
Prices are very high . I was very happy with the work the other time I had you work on my car but when I called to get a price for changing my brakes only i was informed that my rotors had to be turned also. I have two month old rotors which didn’t need to be turned, plus you would not take my brakes that I had and put them on. All I wanted was for you to change my brakes and I could not get that done without other work<//Review>

<review>Invoice  # 30707
I am a service writer that had been in the business for over 10 years .with the recent COVID-19 .I was forced out of work and my wife’s car needed a smog test. I had a Evap issue with a check engine light. With money tight I was relieved to find that San Joaquin county  has a program Tune in tune up that gave a $850.00 voucher. I called around to a few shops looking for a shop that would take my voucher Bruce and jacks auto was one of the listed vendors. I called in and made a reservation two weeks in advance.I dropped my car off on 2/9/21 and was informed two days later that I needed a $30 vacuum baffle and that my voucher would cover the charges” not aware until later on other additional charges “ I was told to drive until my computer monitors were all set and bring it back to smog it. picked up my car and that same night my check engine light came back this was 2/12 Friday night .I called back on Monday was told to bring it back which I did the same day. I was then called on 2/17 and was told the repair was $1493.00. And after my voucher . I had to pay the difference of $643.00
I checked the invoice and was charge for a “road test”$60.00 with out approval. that I performed the past Friday I didn’t know why I was being penalized for a misdiagnosis and was charged for a “bay test” after already being charged $75 diagnostics fee .which they misdiagnosed . 2/22/21 When I came in with my friend to pick up my car “Ron” the unpleasant man behind the counter once again stated that I would have to drive the car and bring it back. I asked him a few questions regarding the charges he did not give me a exact reason for them just told me that’s what they did and I had to pay and he didn’t care what I said .he was rude when asked why I was being charged for certain diagnoses and a road test and what a “ bay test” was he had no explanation he stated there is no law on what we can charge”. I then told  him I was going to inform the “BAR” he once again said I don’t care. I have right to question my invoice fees. He then stated I have to pay $50 for a smog when I return. All I asked was for a little explanation  not very good customer service. I wanted a good experience but it didn’t happen. Hope your car doesn’t end up here.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Paul and his technicians helped me when I was in Stockton in a bind. And promptly too. The metal protective plate under my car had come undone and was scraping the street. They removed it for me. My pastor and his family have taken their cars here for years. Very friendly and professional. Highly recommend Bruce and Jack.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very good attention, the place is very clean, but the office to obtain information about the place is inside the shop on a corner and to get to it you have to cross the work area, and there is nothing to protect the client.

(Original)
Muy buena atención el lugar muy limpio, pero la oficina para obtener información del lugar está adentro del shop en una esquina y para llegar a ella tiene que crusar el área de trabajo, y no ay nada que proteja al cliente.<//review>

Thank you A1 Auto Glass & Window Tinting :) The tint on our mini van is amazing! The check in was easy, friendly and so incredibly informative. They really know their tint ;) My family is riding so much cooler now and don't have to worry about the sun glaring in on the baby. I have been to quite a few automotive places in my time and I have to say this is one of the nicest places I have ever taken my car to. It was such a pleasant experience taking my van in. From start to finish you will be taken care of. Thank you for your time and thank you for having such a pleasant business!< /text>

Excellent experience and professionalism. I didn’t want the cheapest nor the most expensive replacement. I wanted someone who knew what they were doing and took pride in their work. They have been doing this for almost 20 years! I sent my friend here as well who needs tinting!</Text>

They did the job fast and it was extremely well done. The quality of the tint is better then what the dealership had available. It was computer cut so it fits perfect with no gaps. It really enhanced the look of my car. After they were finished they explained my warranty and the details of the tint and insured me if anything goes wrong to give them a call back and they would take care of it, much better then just handing me the keys and saying I'm done. I paid exactly what I was quoted over the phone and they had a comfortable lobby to sit in while I waited. I'm glad I chose this place and would highly recommend it if you need a great tint job or any of the services they offer there.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I went here one day after work with my son, and the A1 technician was amazing, he was able to repair my windshield in minutes.  When he was finished, you couldn’t even tell where the repair was made, it was that good!!!! Wonderful service, great timing, and affordable price, I’ll definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs their services. Thx A1</review>< username>

My friend referred me over to this place, & I was not dissatisfied one bit! I was very pleased with their excellent customer service, & they were very quick with removing my old tint, & replacing the tint in my back window, & they did a very good job as well! I would definitely reccomend this place to anyone who cares about the quality of their tint, & the people they get it from! Thanks Tony!< /text>

I went to A1  and they weren't sure either ---- yup, it was that bad.  Most shops would have said "Wow, that's bad! You're definitely going to need a new windshield" . But Eddy  at A1 took a few extra minutes and worked some magic and saved my windshield!

Skilled and experienced technicians who can work miracles on a difficult repair is good, but a shop that is honest enough to let you go home for $35 when they could have easily charged a lot more for a new windshield is really great!   Based on my experience yesterday, I can definitely say that this is the glass shop I recommend if you are anywhere near San Diego county.</Review><user>106277892935787427293< /user>< Pictures>

Quick and easy, good price, fixed our chip in the windshield, looks great.  Also took our car to get tinted, we love it.  Tony and Zeena and the team were great.  They really took great care of us.  Our car looks beautiful.

Tony & Eddy thank you so much for taking the time & patience to replace the windsheild & adding back on the tint strip on my 370z. With all the glass & window companys in the area I feared not getting the quality work I was looking for. Thank you to Tony & the crew with my past experience of them doing tint all around the car they did an empeccable job. This time I didnt stress one bit that the work I was gonna recieve was any less then meeting the highest expectations of mine. Thank you so much again for taking care of me!!

Went back and forth on a few places in town to tint my windows, extremely impressed and happy I chose A1 auto glass. I was actually next door for smog check and just went in for a quote. 10 minutes later I'm getting ceramic tint. Very professional and upfront about costs/differences I'm glad I finally pulled the plug on tint. This was on presidents day weekend and I had work but they accommodated for me so that I had my car later that day.

It has now been 5 days since the tint was applied and it looks spectacular. Not a single bubble on any of my windows either. The heat difference inside the car is enormous, I'd bring my family's cars here to tint.

Honest, friendly and professional, I'd absolutely come back.<//text>

This shop told me I could come in right away and they fixed the crack in less than 20 min for less than $40. They have excellent low rates on windshield replacement too if your chip or crack can’t be repaired. Great service, good people. Highly recommended.< /review>< pics>

<text>Nice cozy little shop with professional staff. I notified the shop that I needed to reschedule my appointment over the phone, from there I was told to just bring my vehicle in the following morning. Showed up when they opened at 8:30 and Ivan was quick to jump on my vehicles windshield replacement. Him and the rest of his team finished the replacement in a half hour so I was blown away by how fast it went. The replacement comes with a lifetime warranty so if any issues happen to show up all I have to do is bring my car back and they'll repair/replace the windshield for free. Everyone there was nice and professional so I definitely recommend this location.</text><gmap_id>0x80d959a7a970e715:0x5c22137448e663fd<//gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><rating>5</rating>< Time>

The only place I could find in San Diego/el Cajon  California to replace my 1965 Ford F-250 front windshield. I have a really hard to deal with chrome trim around the window and nobody was willing to do it but them. Great customer service and came out amazing. Thanks Tony and Xena.....sorry if I spelt the names wrong. Appreciate the service and speedy turn around. Tell your crew thanks!</Text>

Absolutely amazing customer service!!! I drove over 30 minutes away, with several shops being way closer because this is a small business with unmatched pricing, hospitality, and loyalty to customer service perfection!!! The highest rated tinting business here in San Diego blew me off as “another customer”... A1 made me feel like “THE ONLY CUSTOMER!!!”< /Text>

FANTASTIC service!  A1 Auto Glass was a pleasure to deal with.  The appointment was easy to make, they responded to my needs quickly, the guys were ON TIME, professional, friendly and helpful!  They worked efficiently and kept me updated towards their progress.  If I could give them 10 STARS I would! I will never use another glass place again, as A1 Auto Glass has earned a customer for life. I highly recommend!  The price was right, and the peace of mind for a job well done by respectful, honest techs can't be beat!! I am so happy to have found these guys!</review>

I found A1 on the internet and called and spoke to Eddie. He told me to bring my car in. I thought for sure he would recommend I spend money on some preventative service, but actually he didn't. After he looked at it he told me just to keep an eye on it and if it starts to spread bring it in. That seemed truthful. I'd recommend this place.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Excellent job! I had a messed up tint on my rear window and A1 Auto Glass did an awesome job removing the tint and tinting it again. Plus, they also found a solution for the rubber piece that covers the front windshield. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Great service and paid the exact estimated price that was given to me!<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d959a7a970e715:0x5c22137448e663fd< /GmapID></record>

< review>
After my car was broken into I searched for places with good reviews and A1 Auto Glass lives up to their reviews. They not only do great quality work, but they have the lowest prices. The guys in the office were very nice and accommodating. I had a very nice experience and would highly recommend this place to any of my friends and family.< /review>

<Text>These guys completely dropped the ball.   I was scheduled for 330 back windshield replacement on my commercial vehicle (i emptied the truck to make it easier for them)   I have been waiting around since 3:00 p.m. and I call them at 4:00 p.m. to see where they are and they told me I was supposed to show up at the shop.    I wasted my evening waiting for a mobile service that assumed i was driving in.    I also called for a replacements and a window tint which they said they would not be able to provide unless my truck was alredy there. So even if i go now, my window would not even be tinted yet.   I feel like i was lost in the woodwork and forgotten.  This was not the experience that I first had with this company and will hinder if i ever go back or reference them to anyone.    At this point, if getting your window replaced is important to you, I would choose somebody else.< /Text>< user_id>

A huge rock got flicked up from a big rig on the 125 and smashed my windshield.
I called a couple places and A1 Autoglass gave me the best rate by about $100.

Why I would use them again:
1) They answered my call on the 3rd ring, no long holds or waits
2) Anthony, the guy who answered, was very polite and helpful
3) They were able to schedule to meet with me the same day, and gave me a nice, narrow time window (as opposed to cable companies and their 12 hour time frames)
4) He gave me a bottom-line quote, right off the bat. No fuss.
5) They came out on time, and got the windshield replaced in about 25 minutes. The repairmen, Eddie and Jimmy, were very nice and professional.
6) Great rates.

I am a car insurance agent, and would recommend A1 to any of my clients in the San Diego/East County area who needed body/glass work done to their car.<//review>

Ingredients are not just plentiful but everything taste fresh. Crust and dough is not too thick. Hot wings were juicy and not overcooked. Service was quick and friendly.< /text>< userid>

< Review>
Although Their chicken Alfredo is so good, but apparently there’s two chefs and they don’t use the same recipe. I’ve been ordering the same chicken Alfredo for months and tonight I got the most driest, blandest chicken Alfredo. The young man who answered the phone admitted to being busy and “in a rush”, then the female chef got on the phone basically told me that her and the male chef don’t make the past the same ... but he makes his 20x better !
I suggest asking what chef is there because the female chef shouldn’t even be in the kitchen !</Review>

<text>I wish I could rate their pizza, but I can't because I've never eaten it. I have called to order a few times and they never answer the phone. I have even gone to the place during their stated business hours, doors were locked, not a soul around. I don't know  how they stay in business. Good luck.< /text>< Pics>

very disappointed, I hope the new owners reads this.  I called for delivery and I was told they don't have delivery, I had to ask if it was just for tonight or going forward. That's what I was told well maybe tomorrow. Then I asked well what specials do you have for pickup tonight? I was told we don't have any specials this weekend. I could have been persuaded to come in if somebody shared with me some prices and options. I would have picked it up myself. Me and someone else to answer the phone who can sell the pizza over the phone.<//Text>

The waitress MICHIKA she never came to check how was our food.
If the don't know how to make a dish they shouldn't make it and worst serve it.

I have been on mailbird for four years and used it to combine my gmail and cox personal accounts as well as my business website.   As Mailbird added more features, I had more problems like emails being switched from inbox to sent and problems with not being able to send even if settings were correct on accounts.  I asked for help and they sent a "fix" that totally wiped out my program and I have begged them for a week to help retrieve all my emails that were stored in the program.  As of yet I am unable to open Mailbird again.  Too many features doomed this software and I can't get them to help fix it.</Text>

I love Mailbird. It's a great email application and so glad I purchased it. Mailbird really helps me organise my emails and easily delete in bulk all the excess emails that clog up my inbox. Mailbird is a beautiful layout and easy to use. Thanks Mailbird :)</text>

Has works really well for years with an easy to understand interface that links all my accounts together. Not perfect (no scheduled sending) yet but there are constant upgrades and fixes to bugs from a very active development team. I love it!</review>

It's more than a year that I switched to Mailbird. I love the design - it stands out. I love it because I can integrate different services such as Wunderlist, Whatsapp, Google Apps, Trello etc. What it misses are some right-click functions and the possibility to move email messages between accounts.< /Text>

<text>I initally used windows mail but it was very buggy. Came upon Mailbird several years ago while searching for alternatives. Tested it & all the issues/errors with windows mail vanished under MB. Within 30 minutes I bought MB Pro lifetime.

I love the built in addons: chrome, dropbox,google drive,facebook, twitter,whatsapp etc. All intergrated into Mailbird making it much easier to multi-task or chat while working.

More recently the product line was re-worked. I got a free upgrade to the top tier business edition while retaining my lifetime key. Which shows the staff truly appreciate their long term customers. Thanks to Andrea & staff for the excellent app & continued hardwork :)

I just wish there was an Android version of Mailbird!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
This mobile home park deserves zero stars. I viewed a home there with my realtor, I then tried to apply to live in the park before purchasing. The manager was beyond rude! I informed him that I have a fairly large inside dog, he is my 4 year old sons service animal. Not an “Emotional support animal” a trained service dog for my sons disability! The manager goes on a tangent saying he can’t stop me from applying but there will be a lot of a hatred towards my family and how many problems I’m going to cause, all the neighbors will hate me and my disabled 4 year old and will basically not stop until we move. These people are extremely Prejudiced and I wouldn’t recommend this park to anyone. Being told that people would hate us and we wouldn’t be welcomed because my 4 year old son is disabled and needs assistance was mind blowing and heartbreaking all at the same time.< /Review>

I've lived here for 2 years now and it's overall a great place to live. Manager is super cool, very respectful and most importantly takes care of the residents! He makes sure the park stays clean, looks nice and enforces the rules that keep a higher living standard than other mobile home parks. Cleaner, quieter, safer park = higher resale value of your mobile home.</text>

This is not a 4 star park alot if homes are run down and not well kept up. Trashy people walking around 10:30am with beer in hand. This park is for trashy people.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a very nice and quiet place to live, I lived here for 3 years and live very comfortable, we never had problems, the rent is a little more than in other parking lots but it is worth it since the place is very well maintained, it also counts with clubhouse and pool that open during the summer.

Es un lugar muy bonito y tranquilo para vivir, viví aquí por 3 años y se vive muy agusto, nunca tuvimos problemas, la renta es un poco más que en otros parqueaderos pero vale la pena ya que el lugar está muy bien cuidado, además cuenta con clubhouse y alberca que abren durante el verano.</Review>

This was the worst experience I have ever had at a saloon.  I paid alot of money for a hairstyle I didn't want. I asked for shoulder length hair. It's up to my ears. Hideous. I hate it. I will never return or suggest this place to anyone. I have no idea why they did this to me but it was like a personal attack. My hair is destroyed. Ear length hair. I hate it.   Worst experience of my life in a saloon.<//Review>

< Review>
Olga was able to fit me in after driving  home from work. First time there.  I always see the salon along the way home in Roseville.  Decided to try it. She paid attention to detail and obviously takes pride in her work.  Very nice to talk to as well.  The owner was there and seemed polite  and friendly as well.  My hair looks great.  Tipped her well and took a business card with me to schedule the next cut.</Review>

< Review>
I made an appointment for my teenage daughter to have her hair cut and colored. When I made the appointment over the phone in advance, I explained that it was an undercut and that her hair was short and that she wanted to have her top long layer fade to blonde. We arrived for her appointment and stood in the doorway at the front desk for five minutes before anyone looked up or asked why we were there. I had called on my way there to tell them we would be there shortly and to verify that she still had an appointment. It seemed odd that nobody greeted us when we walked in. After 5 minutes, finally someone acknowledged us, and got the hairdresser that was supposed to do my daughter’s hair. She looked at her  short hair and said she can’t do short haircuts,  but offered to do the color. I’m not sure where the misunderstanding happened but it was definitely a waste of my time because I was not going to have her color her hair without the hair being cut. Her hair was way too long for the cut she wanted. I didn’t want to waste expensive color. Needless to say I was not happy and they knew it. I walked out. It may have been A language barrier situation but I don’t understand why they would make a haircut appointment at a place that can’t do short haircuts. What salon doesn’t do short haircuts? I will never go there again.< /Review>

The salon is just beautiful.
The new remodel is just great scenario that completes the salon like a puzzle piece.
They make one of the best haircuts.
I would advice to go to the person who's name is Неля in russain. She cuts haircuts like she is a professional. She already has multiple awards given to her because of her haircuts that she has done.< /Review>

< Review>
Love my hairstylist Yelena! She always takes her time to cut or color my hair. She is very careful when it comes to not damaging my hair or cutting off too much. When i color mine blond the color comes out perfect. She also gives advices on how to proper care for the hair and vitamins to take. Love this place and highly recommend.</Review>

I felt judged when I first walked in they didn't even give me a chance and turned me down without offering to schedule me for a different day. I walked in expecting to get a haircut since I seen the walk-in sign on the front window. So I hit up super cuts n chose to spend my hard errand money with super cuts off Walerga rd in belair Plaza. I am happy I did not allow this salon to cut my hair even though I'm of Slavic descent, 100% pure blooded UKRAINIAN!
DISCLAIMER : I would put no stars but I understand that people don't take those seriously.<//Text>

Definately recommend angelina!! I was so nervous walking in this place I have never let anyone cut my hair before and my hair was almost to my butt and I wanted and needed layers being that my hair was sooo thick and long....angelina had cut my friends long hair before but its not the same when its your own....I left so happy my layers were great, she left a lot of length just took all the dead off everyone loved my hair.....PERFECT CUT!!!!<//Review>

< Review>
I usually look at their specials menu though. Whenever there's something called "Short on Cash" I always get it. They give you a 1lb whole lobster, homemade chips, coleslaw, and bread n butter. For around $20, it's the best deal on lobster in the store in my opinion.People often rave about the blueberry lemonade. It's quite tasty, but I don't find myself always getting it. Besides the Short on Cash special, the lobster chowder is quite delicious. As for their lobster rolls, the highlight is their bread they use. I love the grilled buns that taste of delicious butter. Also, if you get a chance to have some of their baguette rolls, it's absolutely amazing.</Review>

Good quality chicken, try out the seafood. Fresh as it can be. They'll even cut it or cook it for you.
Better than most grocery stores can offer!!!
Try to come early though, gets packed by mid-day.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Today 6/5/18 at 11 am I had a craving for fresh chicken, I was working and I told my husband to go. The surprise came to cook it and it turns out to be rotten and I did not go to change it because I did not lose my park I realized because it removed the skin was black parts of the thighs better I go where I choose the chicken alive because I do not recommend it. .

<Text>I still waiting for my device too charge up*. Not for you basic item repairs. A possible referral to elsewhere. Another area too quite and empty except construction and clean ups with low car traffic and people.
Not missing the creeps, transients, students, solicators, activist are beggers leaving the city at 75% business shut down.<//Text>< pictures>

I'm torn on this review.

On one hand, it's terrific that a business like this can exist at all.  If you are a hobbyist or like to repair things, this is (potentially) a great resource.  The people running it do seem to care, even if they're not always the most personable.  I see some complaints about them being rude, but I don't buy it.

As a brick&mortar business, however, it lets me down.  I've gone in for basic parts several times - lamp-cord switch, XT power connectors, etc. - and they're out of stock.  Looking around, empty shelves/bins are not uncommon.  It seems they have difficulty keeping stocked up.

Prices are high compared to online import stuff, sure, but what they carry is name-brand and the markup isn't unreasonable if you can get something now instead of waiting for shipping.<//Review>

This store is a true gem of Berkeley if you like to tinker with electronics and don’t want to wait for shipping if you just need a handful of tidbits or supplies. Very charming and knowledgeable people working there.</review>

Map location is a little off, took a little looking to find. I was looking for the right fittings for cat 6 and a crimper- 10 for 10 lasher's hooked it up. Real original spot with just about everything you need and two things you don't need but kinda want.< /review>

They had a tiny screw that held my Honda Accord key together, which I had difficulty finding until I dropped by their store. All better now, and super reasonable in cost. Even told me what size and type it was in case another is needed in the future. Five stars. Thank you.< /text>

<Review>Al Lasher's Electronics has to be the last word in "Old School" electronics.  There credo appears to be "Make a customer ... not a sale."   Their stock seems to be infinitely varied and appropriate to whatever project you may have conceived in your mind.  The entire family and staff are always friendly and as helpful as you may require. If advice is needed, the staff is happy to offer it without additional charge, BUT ONLY IF YOU ASK FOR IT.  May they continue to live long, prosper and the force be with them, etc., etc., forever.</Review></record>

Total asset to the community

A vast selection of items that you normally don't need....until you need them!

Are you the next Steve Wozniak?  If so, head over to Al Lasher's and get your stuff

or, if you are more like me......they've got electrical stuff, electronic stuff, wiring, fuses, more more more more more.

They have so much stuff that I HIGHLY doubt that even they know what they've got

And yet, they know where everything is!

Reasonably priced, and more important, they will guide you to JUST what you need

truly, they are a great asset

Good selection and a super knowledgeable staff. What more would you want from a small parts electronics store? They'll spend time helping you if you need it whether you're buying a fifty cent part or a fifty dollar part. I hope that they remain in business for a long time, it's a valuable resource.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><name>Kevin Zimmerman<//name><text>This is a very special place. They have vacuum tubes in stock ... and raspberry pi & Arduino platforms and the stuff you need to make them useful. Burning Man supported here! Watch batteries are affordable, some in multiple quality levels - and they know the difference and will tell you so you (um, just kidding!) might not have to put premium batteries in that screeching wonder that somehow inhabits your home. Or (quite seriously now) you need a 14-pin CMOS dual comparator *this afternoon* or a vintage o-ring belt for a prime cassette deck or CD player? I think you can still test your vacuum tubes for free on their Hickok mutual-conductance type tester (That's the good kind, for those of you who - grin! - never owned a fully-stocked tube caddy). They don't always have that special something, but sometimes they  can make your jaw drop. Truly amazing, with good people behind the counter to match.</text><userid>105177322000786242308<//userid>< Response>

<Review>Nobody broke out the windows in the demonstration a few nights ago. Plywood is up on the windows as a precaution. It's still in operation.

It has been an East Bay community resource for electronic parts for the fifty years I've been here. The big inventory and reasonable prices almost always means you can get the part you need right away instead of having to wait for delivery from an online company.

The staff are almost always friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Don't expect slick packaging.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I'm a audio devices/systems collector.
Went there this afternoon to get a fuse.  They don't have the right one for my sub-woofer made in England after a few tries.
I ready appreciated his efforts and Al (?) even told me where to go might solve my problem.
You don't run into any stores like this too often anymore.  Try this store and see for yourself. Thank you Al.</Text>

<review>Great resource to have around for the maker, the fiddler, and the DIY nerd.  Places like this used to be in every town, but in today's throwaway age they're few and far between.  If you know exactly what you want and can wait a few weeks, you can get better prices direct from China on caps, diodes, etc., of course.  However, if you want it now, or you have a question, or you don't mind spending a few extra pennies to preserve this resource for a time when you do want it now or have questions...

Fun place to spend some time in, too!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

Love the store. They have everything i need for my arduino projects.
One small downside is that their opening times are a bit inconvenient - i can only visit them on Saturdays as i am working a 9-5 job and cannot make it on time during the week. Would be great if they had one day a week where they are open to 8pm.<//text>

<review>Al Lasher's is a great place to find lots of obscure electronic things as well as staples: wire, solder, tools, connectors, headers, soldering iron tips and more!  I'm quite pleased how often I find the parts I need without having to accumulate enough stuff to make an online order. Much better quality and selection than the Radio Shack about a block up the street.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

It is the best electronics store in the bay area. Every imaginable item from resistors, transistors, switches, LEC lighting, tools and very smart people that can help you with your electronic project. This place makes Radio Shack look like a pathetic joke.<//review>

I love this place.  If you go into a Radio Shack the prices are through the roof, the selection is weak, and the people working at the store know very little.  At Al Lasher's you get exactly the opposite.</text>

As a hobbyist, this is by far the best electronics store I've been in. I moved away from the bay several years ago, and have yet to find anything even remotely similar. Knowledgeable staff, huge product selection, reasonable prices. This is why local businesses are better -- give them your money, they work for it!< /review>

<Text>I was referred here by my favorite hardware store, the Grand Lake Ace Hardware, so I had high expectations.  They were exceeded by the level of expertise, friendliness, inventory and pricing that I experienced, and continue to experience, at this local wonderland of electronics.  This is a family owned business and has been around for decades.  To the easily intimidated or those looking for a pack of AA batteries, don't be overwhelmed by the dizzying array of items that greets you upon opening the door.  Rest easy that the smiling faces behind the counter can and will answer any question you might have.  I am a long time DIY tinkerer and can well appreciate the vastness and power of the Internet.  From eBay to Parts Exress to Deals Extreme, I know I can usually find any electronic part on the web.  However, when I don't know what I'm looking for, but I do know the application I am planning, the web can be a cold and lonely place with only the sometime dubious advice of the user forums and discussion boards to give suggestions.  This is where Al Lasher's comes to the rescue nearly every time.  They have provided many a solution to the kinds of hurdles that every DIY tinkerer comes across mid-build of an electronics project.  Whether is is that perfect DPDT toggle I needed, the 12v SAE bullet connector, or that single 4000uf mylar capacitor that had the cell phone salesperson at Radio Shack busy Googling to see what it looked like (true story), the Lashers have come through.  They know exactly which row of which stack of what shelf to locate any part and, unlike most places these days, you can buy a single part rather than a 12-pack.  Seriously, when I needed to replace an led in my car's dashboard that the dealer wanted to charge $400 for and Amazon's vendor was selling by the dozens only, a visit to Al Lasher's netted me just the part I needed.  $.75 later the dash was back to its backlit glory.  Check them out, there's no other place I know of like it in the bay area (if anyone says "what about Fry's Electronics" smack them in the face).< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Everyone on the team was courteous and helpful.  Lydia, who handled my paperwork and preliminary exam, was engaged, friendly and competent. Dr. Horne immediately put me at ease ("please call me Joe") and continued to create a sense of ease throughout the exam.  Everyone communicated well.  The appointment started on time and proceeded efficiently. They processed my insurance easily and by the time I left, I had ordered frames--already received in less than 2 weeks. I recommend Pacific Eye Paso!<//review>< user>

Staff at Pacific Eye are friendly and knowledgeable, sharing a true concern for your well-being and are sympathetic to your needs. Doctors are always  kind and uphold unyielding professionalism, yet making themselves accessible to your questions or concerns. I am more than pleased with the level of service provided by doctors and staff at Pacific Eye and would recommend them to anyone in need of eye professionals.< /review>

Dr. Horne is very patient, explains procedures and address all of my concerns. He never rushes through the exam and takes his time making sure that my eyes are healthy. I appreciate that he takes his time getting the best prescription for me. He has been doctor for about 10 years and I am very grateful that I have him to turn to for my eye car.<//text>

Everyone I encountered on staff was so helpful and friendly!  I was the last appointment of the day and I didn't feel rushed through my exam.  Dr. Horne is kind and was very thorough.  I was also referred to their ophthalmologist, Dr. Spiegel, who was also great!   She took the time to answer all my questions and address my concerns.< /Review>

I love this office! They have always been a terrific office with a great staff, however they are even better now! They go out of the way to make sure that they have complied with all things necessary to keep you safe in this age of “Covid” craziness. Their office is over-the-top clean and safe. You need not worry about anything when you walk in the door. I’m not only over 65, but I’m also a nurse and I was completely comfortable...and that’s saying a lot for me. Great job everyone!,,</Text>

Dr. Oldenburg has been my eye doctor for nearly 10 years.  He's caring, explains clearly and in "English", and listens to you, the patient.  Can't recommend him highly enough.  Nice staff, too.<//Text>

Had to wait a long time for my exam even though I had an appointment.   Next time I  will ask if they are running behind and reschedule.  Didn't want to sit in a room with people I did not know.< /text>

Patient care has really gone down hill here. Always waiting over an hour, inaccurate prescriptions, and rude employees. Waited a hour and 30 minutes today to be seen by the doctor for 6 minutes. Time to look for a new eye doctor!</review>

<text>From the beginning absolutely amazed by the professionalism and competency of each staff involved.  Scheduling an appointment was easy, less than a five minute wait upon arrival for appointment, explanation of examination process clearly provided and finally assistance from staff during the selection of eyeware was exceptional.  Definitely will be returning....<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I have received both routine eye care and cataract surgery at Pacific Eye. The results on both have been excellent. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Examinations are thorough and explained. There is sometimes a long wait, but I am sure that is because they are giving the client before me their undivided attention.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80ecc50e28dcb3a9:0x933e134b1b44ea2a</gmap_id>< Resp>

Dr. Chowins helped me acquire with hard contact lenses, which I wore 15 plus years ago and much prefer to the soft. He and the Optical Tech, Valerie, worked together to ensure optimum coverage from my insurance. I am very happy with the results and grateful for my contacts.  The complete experience was helpful and enjoyable.
Thank you for the great team work, and the pleasant atmosphere of both the SLO and Paso offices.</review>

I dropped in without an appointment to pick up some eye drops.  The staff member I was there to see was out to lunch.  The receptionist at the front desk took the time to check on my drops, found they were ready for pickup and brought them out for me.  This eliminated the need for me to return at a later date.  Thank you<//review>

The Metro is THE BEST!! Very affordable, reliable transportation, clean, and trains come every 9 min. You can get anywhere in Los Angeles on the Metro. Environmentally friendly, TOTALLY check it out!!</Text>

The metro system would be awesome! It'd be great if there wasn't that many homeless people n there.  Personally, I've been attacked physically by a homeless dude. Not proud to say, but did I just stand there with my arms crossed to get hit get taught a lesson? No, he hit me so I taught him a lesson!<//review>

It's very overwhelming, there's so much there. It's very easy to go the wrong way. The nice thing is that employees and police are happy to give you directions and get you where you need to be. It took me along time to find my way around this place. Now that I am comfortable, I don't mind going there. Lots of choices for a snack, coffee or a cool drink. When I was there in March 2020, the restrooms were available, clean and stocked.</Text>

This is one busy station being that it connects to 3 other lines. There is a big  Law Enforcement presence there, but a fairly clean station. There are the occasional homeless people but not too many. Again, the officers there keep it contained.< /Text>

<text>The LA metro is very reliable. I lived in LA thru the eighties and the only public transportation was the city bus. They were old, broken down and very stinky back then so it's a 180° turn around</text>< Pictures>

Busy place as usual but had transients on the train. Im fine with them riding but, when he statrted messing with parts of the train I was done. He broke a pamphlet holder off the wall. No reason, just wanted to I guess. It didnt spoil my ride. But it was also the day the deputies got shot as well as the train from dtla was stopped on the tracks. Apparently, soneone got hit by the train I was on and we had to evacuate- literally on the tracks at the stop before Slauson.</text>

The station was very calm , even somewhat more peaceful then usual .  My thoughts are that probably during this time of Covid-19 there are fewer riders and everyone is a bit more focused.</Text>

Never thought I'd see the day that Los Angeles would have a train system .  In the 1990s I had a customer Mr. Catellus and his son .  They were over at Amtrak and Metro Redline line was downstairs, in the Amtrak Union Station . FYI , you can even rent cars in the Amtrak Union Station .<//Review>

I use the 7 th and metro station to travel from downtown Los Angeles  to Santa Monica beach or the Natural History Museum on the E-line . The A-LINE gones to Long Beach and stop to visit friends.
On the lower level I've travelled to the heart of Hollywood of Hollywood and Vine or you can take a trip to Univeral Studios Hollywood on the Red line. The Red and Purple line can take you to Union Station to Amtrak, Metro rail and fly away to Los Angeles International airport.
From Union station you can walk to Olveria Street and eat at one of the restaurants. On Sunday you can hear Mass at the Mission  Chruch.< /Review>

<rate>2</rate><resp>None</resp><Text>Well it looks like the red & blue line that I take to Union station from 7th & Fig. Usually late esp. the blue. Considering Union station is 3 stops away it can be  a nail biter making it on time for the Metrolink. Even if I'm on time the trains will stop short and wait for a space to open up. I've missed a many Metrolink trains due to this. I suppose it's better than taking a street bus in rush hour traffic to go to Union station. So, I use the apps to check on the status of my trains before I head on down to the platforms.</Text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I like to travel by subway. And I would like there to be more cleaning, sometimes it is dirty and there is nowhere to sit because many people take their seats to sleep I think it would be good for everyone who goes up to the subway to have their mask on there are many who get on and do not use their mask for the good of all it would be good

(Original)
Me.gusta viajar en metro. Y me gustaría q hubiera más limpieza en el aveces esta sucio y no hay donde sentarse porq muchas personas toman sus asientos para dormir pienso estaría bien q todo el q se sube a metro tuviera puesta su mascarilla hay muchos q se suben y no usan su mascarilla por el bien de todos seria bueno<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a means of daily transport to my work ... The schedule is very good but the truth in toilet is missing a lot ... The truth is very difficult for the Metrp company but the users are not all the same and for some we all pay ... There are more homeles, more people making disorder and garbage, and they occupy the subway to sleep there 😣😣 it is a shame to be honest because it is a super developed country but for that reason it will be more and more difficult .. Friends you have to have some passion with others 😉😉😅

(Original)
Es miedio de transporte diario hacia mi trabajo ... El horario muy bueno pero la verdad en aseo lea falta mucho ... La verdad es muy dificil para la compañia de Metrp pero los usuarios no todos son iguales y por unos pagamos todos ... Hay mas homeles, mas personas haciendo desorden y basura, y ocupan el metro para dormir alli 😣😣 es una pena la verdad por que es un paiz super desarollado pero por esa razon cada vez sera mas didicil ..Amigos hay que tener pasciensia unos con otros 😉😉😅</Text>< user_id>
