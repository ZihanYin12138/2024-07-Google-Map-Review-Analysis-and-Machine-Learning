<Date>1614403914966<//Date><rate>5<//rate><text>Just had to share my experience with this business.  I needed to order burritos for a school staff luncheon and needed a variety.  I ordered 20 burritos and had them cut in half in order to accommodate 30-40 people.  They were friendly and helpful!  They had no problem cutting them in half and wrapping them neatly for me. They placed them in large trays for me and labeled them.  I ordered beef, pork, chicken and vegetarian, loaded.  The price was very reasonable and they were ready right when they were promised!  The school staff was very happy!  They loved them!  I will be back to order from this business again!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809af75e5b1498f3:0x5dfe1de32d44354c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great food actually some of the best Mexican food around. I would have 5 star but closed Saturday and Sunday is not good. So with my busy work schedule I rarely get to eat there. Kind of strange a restaurant would be closed over the wknd.
O well I guess I'll go somewhere else again!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

Wow!!!  This is a super-great Taqueria.  If you have not yet tried Taqueria Tepa Burritos, you should!  Everything tastes very fresh and seems to be made with high-quality meats.  I only wish that I found this place sooner!< /Text>

Went here for lunch and was very disappointed. Barely gave me any meat in my burrito and it was cold. Food barely had taste to it. Very bland didn't taste authentic. Taco bell is better then this place. I don't recommend NEVER!!< /review>

The proteins were all bland and under seasoned. I got chicken tacos and the chicken just didn’t have much flavor. The seasoning was tasty, but barely there. The salsa and guacamole flavors on the taco were good though. The salsa with the chips didn’t have much flavor. I got a side of rice and black beans and the black beans tasted like they weren’t seasoned at all. I’d be willing to try it again and will make sure to request they season things heavier but it’s not high on the list.. service was fast at least.</text>

This food is almost as good as my Grandma's, and she made the best Mexican food. I've tried the shredded beef smothered burrito with beans/rice and the Chile Verde burrito. Seriously delicious!<//text>

This became a permanent addition to my lunch rotation as soon as I had my first Super Taco (al pastor). I immediately brought tacos home to my family and I was a dinner hero. Don't let the sparse decor fool you, there's a wizard in the kitchen.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Food is very good and some of the absolute best mexican food in El Dorado County.  Chips and Salsa are both excellent.  Prices are also good for the portions.  The dining area is pretty small but the ambiance is pretty nice.  Only complaint is that everybody who works there seems to be nice except one woman in particular who is obsessed with her cellphone and seems genuinely put off that she has to pry her eyes off her phone and take your order.  I've never once heard her tell me or anybody thank you.  Everybody else is nice though and food is great so still 4 Stars!<//Review>

< Review>
DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have given my business at least once a month to this place since I was a teenager and have sung it's praises. Well yesterday I ordered what I always order. A meatless item as I have been a vegetarian for the last 15 years of my life. I started eating the Spanish rice and then there was a piece of chicken in my mouth. I spit it out disgusted and looked through the rice and found chicken everywhere inside it. I got really nauseas and threw the whole meal away. I later called to let them know what had happened just to give them a heads up because it's not okay and they should be more careful. The guy on the phone was the tall guy who is always there and he offered me a refund for my meal without me asking for it. He said he would be in the next day and I can come in. So today I walk in and talk to the short guy with the beard and told him there was chicken in my meatless meal yesterday and I was offered a refund. He said, "I'll give you your money back but we will never serve you again." I was obviously perplexed and asked, "what?" He then walked over and said the rice was in front and the chicken was behind it and that there is nothing they can do and I shouldn't complain and should just eat around it it's not a big deal and that they are banning me from the establishment because this is my second complaint. In my head I never have complained but then I remembered like two years ago I ordered cheese enchiladas and I came back to my home and it was chicken enchiladas so I went back and told them that this wasn't what I ordered and they replaced it. Luckily I hadn't taken a bite I could just tell looking at them and cut it open. This is not a freaking complaint this is you giving me something I didn't order and CANNOT eat. Anyways I was very angry and taken aback and asked for my money back and his name obviously not in the kindest way because I was angry and he cussed back at me and told me he wouldn't give me his name.

This place and that man whoever he is whether he's just an employee or the owner is EVIL and does not deserve your business ESPECIALLY if you do not eat meat! They could care less about your health and dietary restrictions and don't respect their customers at all. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS.< /Review>

On January 10, 2019 at 6.23 pm i went to Jersey Mike's and placed an order for two sub sandwiches.  I repeatedly requested Avocado.  After arriving home I sat down to eat and realized there was no Avocado!  I called the store and they told me to bring the sandwiches back and they would remake them.  I told the clerk that it was too long of a drive for me just to replace a sandwich. The female clerk told me sharply,  that "that is the best we can do".  I told her thank you and got off the phone.  My family frequents this store.  I will make it known so that everyone will try elsewhere.< /text>

<text>When I arrived at Jersey Mike’s, Rancho San Diego, I was welcomed by the friendly and respectful workers. While I was ordering my sub sandwich, I noticed that the bread looked very soft compared to Subway, which is on the other side of the very same shopping center. I got tempted to try one of the the cookies, because they looked so sweet and savory. Once I took my first bite of my sub, I enjoyed the fresh, moth-watering taste of the sandwich. Once I finished, I took a bite of my cookie. I just have one thing to say about that. You have not tried real cookie until you tried this one. I would take Jersey Mike’s over Subway any day!</text><resp>{'time': 1534504751739, 'text': 'Hi Jayden. Thank you for the great review and the 5 star rating!

Consistently good food and customer service. I'm from Point Pleasant we're at the original Jersey Mike's started many many years ago, and it's amazing how consistent the food is even thousands of miles away out here in California.< /Text>

They messed both my boyfriend and my orders. I ordered a chicken caeser wrap with bacon, paid for bacon but got no bacon. My boyfriend ordered a BLT with avocado and also received onions which don't go on a BLT.... Chances are slim I go to this one again. I would u derstand more if it was busy but there was only one other person.< /Review>

I made a phone order and when I arrived at the store I had to wait 25 minutes after the time that Jersey Mike's set for my food to be ready. They ran out of white bread and meatballs. This was the longest I have had to wait at this particular store. Corporate will be heading from me in the morning. They got one stat because there is not a zero star setting.< /Text>

It is the same format as Subway, with essentially the same bread, meat, and fixings. The difference is that the bread has this weird crumbiness to it that I can't help but love. The cookies are also tastier. If you were on the fence, Jersey Mike is the better option.< /Review>

< Review>
On March 18, 2019, I placed an order with ubereats for a number 4, giant. I received my order and as the driver left and I entered my house, I noticed that I received a half sized sub. I called Jersey Mike’s and told them. I asked if I could exchange it. I was told they would close at 9pm as it was 8:43pm when I called. I showed up at 8:51pm. I asked if my 1/2 sub was a giant sub, and advised it was just delivered by ubereats. I was advised that up the ubereats driver had multiple orders and gave me the wrong one. I placed my incorrect order on the counter and said thank you very much and left. Although most likely not their fault, I was less than pleased with their resolution of this and thus will likely avoid going here in the future. I realize that the owner was not here and would have likely resolved this issue in my favor, even though the ubereats driver most likely made the error, I am presuming. The food is good here, but I had to vent as I felt that I kind of got screwed, and the manager didn’t care. I did call ubereats afterwards. Then I picked up food elsewhere.<//Review>

< Review>
Fantastic deli quality subs with fresh fresh veggies! As far as quality of food, i would give 5 stars. My two gripes with the place is the speed in which the sandwiches are made and the size orientation of the sandwiches. First, all the meat is freshly sliced before its placed on the bread every time. Though it adds to that extra freshness, It can cause a lengthy wait time during busy hours. My biggest problem with the place is they only have 3 sizes. Small (4"), regular (8") and giant (16"). For me, if im hungry and i want a good sized sandwich, an 8 inch sub can leave me a little unsatisfied, but a 16 inch sub is way too much food and pricey. Id like to see them incorporate a large size like 10-12 inches. If none of that bothers you, then its definately a good sandwich chain to try.</Review>

<Review>Extremely disappointed in the sandwich my husband brought home tonight.  He ordered exactly what I requested (I was on the phone with him) - a full sized "Big Kahuna" on white, extra mushroom, no jalapenos, cut into 4ths. (I like to save half in the freezer).

Well, it had extra mushrooms, yay!  It also had jalapenos on it.

I have an ulcer.  I can't eat peppers, so I got to spend the first 5 minutes of dinner picking them out of my sandwich.  It wasn't world shattering, by any means, just an annoyance.

But - what if I were allergic to jalapeno peppers?  This could have resulted in a visit to the ER (or worse).

PAY ATTENTION, people who prepare my food!  You got lucky this time.<//Review><gmapID>0x80d95bb647ac5d15:0x539f725d0e579753< /gmapID>< Time>

<Text>I absolutely love Jersey Mike's, #56 with provolone was what I was looking forward to all day. Long time customer.

However this was single handedly the worst sanwhich I have ever gotten from any deli. The bread on both mine and my wife sandwich was so dry, like they were trying to get rid of day old bread.
The meat was also extremely over cooked ,I had to go as far as adding some Mayo to it just to give it some moisture. This is something I would not expect from Jersey Mike's.

So very disappointed with this experience.<//Text>< date>

We love coming here. We are a family of three and we all enjoy this place. Our favorite is the bridge near by. It's perfect for a little walk. Our 2-year old son loves the play area a lot.</review>

San Ramon is a great place for walkers.. You can walk, miles and miles, in absolute silence... There's a park in every neighborhood..

I love in Bangalore India... When I visit San Ramon, the first thing I would like to do is to step out and walk in the stoic still of the trails..<//text>

Excellent place to take your kids. Wide field for sports like soccer and a playground, all next to a nice creek under the bridge you can relax near.</review>

Mostly we just walk or jog through this park on our daily exercise but its usually full of families large and small and always looks like everyone is having a great time. Lots of dog owners like to play with their animals on the lawn and I have also seen volleyball nets and soccer practice happening on the lawn as well (though its not big enough for a real soccer field.) It's really a fairly small park but big enough for the tiny community it supports I guess. Being right next to a creek full of neat wildlife makes it a great place for a peaceful walk when its quiet enough to hear the birds.< /review>

Nice neighborhood park. Good play structures for kids, complete with small climbing wall. Tennis courts, 2 bocce courts, BBQ grills and some picnic tables. Parking lot, street parking, and restrooms that are normally both open and clean. Good spot for kids to play, for birthday parties or just to walk the dog.</Review>

<review>Nice quiet park. A great place for kids to run and play. There are benches around the play area for parents to easily keep an eye on their kids. Big open, grassy area for kids to play tag, play catch, etc.</review><Name>Brad Partridge<//Name><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

Very peaceful place to go with your family, walk your dog or play some tennis. You can also use the grill.< /Text>

Quiet little park, tucked away in a sleepy suburb.  This park is a lot of fun because it has tennis courts, bocce ball courts, playground equipment, expansive grass field and working bathrooms.< /Review>

<review>We had an amazing time at The Wave Water Park. We celebrated my husband's birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We took advantage of the Friday night special they have going on for the summer. Reserved a big Cabana and got the meals for the whole party. Their food could have been hotter, but overall, everything was great. Our hostess continuously checked in on us.<//review><user_id>110784746175450907875<//user_id><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Such a fun time. I do love all the lifeguards around every area. They're very on top of safety. I like how clean the water is and it's a very simple Park. I really enjoy just sitting in the inner tube and going around and around and around and around and around in the lazy pool. Their food is just regular concession stand food and the prices are not that bad.<//Text>< pictures>

Off to yet another great stay at The Wave Water park. Checking in we were lucky enough to deal with Theresa at the front desk. What a wonderful first impression she makes! She made my Grandson feel like a king, she was engaging and a fountain of information. As a CEO I appreciate those who clearly enjoy their job and want to make the most for guests and customers. Theresa is a superstar! And so is The Wave Water park, it's our go to with the Grand kids. Thanks for coming to So, CA!< /Text>

Cool water, kids and adults splashing in the pool, others attempting to show some skill on the Waves' body boards,  and others just enjoying the lazy river.  What more could a person want .. food?  They have that too, basic concession stand stuff, hot dogs,  hamburgers,  pizza, sodas, water, some treats , including Dippin Dots.<//text>

Nice place, good discount via Groupon. Not an over the top water park but somewhere in the middle. Two slides were out of operation. Pizza is not great, kids would not eat it. There is little kids area with water features. Best to get there early and get a shaded spot. Plenty of chairs to lounge. Gets a bit crowded but not enough to make it any less fun.< /Text>

This place is so awesome! A waterpark without the lines! Had my son's 5th birthday here. We were able to rent a cabana and have cake and snacks, it was great! Everyone had a blast, and the prices were low.</review>

<time>1498839305532</time><rate>3</rate><text>More than a pool, but less than an actual water park.    It's a nice place, with chairs to sit in and a few water features.  4 waterslides and a "lazy river" in addition to the pool.  It's a good place to go for a few hours, but hard to make a day of it.  They do have food/drinks there, so that helps.  The price can be expensive relative to other fully equipped water parks, so look for deals to keep it reasonable for a half-day visit.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHYsBEYcx3s20kOzqvi96KCtd6SEX8kDupwtVp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

It’s a great place to take your kids to play! Just so you know if you want to get a two person tube it costs $5-10 but the single tube is free. Plus sometimes the lines are long to go on the slides but it’s definitely worth the wait! 😁
If you go to the water park I hope you enjoy it!😉<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Small, intimate environment that's has the vibe of a community pool but it offers so much more.
The slides are exciting and you could see visitors of all shapes and sizes enjoying all four of them. The lazy river is not so lazy but you can easily procure an inflatable and enjoy the movement. The slide entrance is just another plus.
The Wave at the center of the park adds a little bit of excitement that you don't get to experience everywhere. The fun and excitement of boogie boarding on a tsunami in the safe confines of my backyard. Fantastic!
The Olympic sized swimming pool is clean and the abundance of Life Guards makes sure you feel safe at all times.
The kiddie section is a great place for the kids to burn off a little extra energy and have some serious fun!
The park has something for everyone and the prices are so reasonable that it doesn't feel like a burden on the wallet.
Would highly recommend, especially for families!< /review>

We just floated along as a family and it is one of the best memories from our trip. Our big boys loved the slides and our baby boy loved the baby area. The staff was very attentive and friendly; they danced too! The only "negative" was the food prices but what amusement park doesn't charge an arm and leg?!

<Text>Great for kids. It's a smaller place than I was expecting for the $20+ admission price and you have to pay and extra $5 for the luxury of having a locker.

That said it's fun and they are obviously VERY on top of safety. The lifeguards are drilled with military precision it was actually pretty fascinating to watch their highly orchestrated patrols. There were like 3 safety drills while we were there.

Food prices not bad - was pleasantly surprised not to be gouged on a hot dog.

Fun place to take the kids. Has a little kiddie splash pad area for the real little ones. The food is actually affordable, unlike a lot of these places. They have a grill right next to the building where they will even grill your burger for you. Several lifeguards watching out for accidents posted all around the slides and pool.<//review>

Typical park food, burgers etc. Slides, lazy river and a huge pool- we had a great time and plan to go back. Best to go when they open. It gets busy. I know you might think that it is cold if you are on the East Coast but it is nice and toasty here. I bought a pass to use the facility every day. It has clean pools, bathrooms, and the lifeguards are great. It is a must if you are in the area and there is a random Santa Ana.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dc76a22916a3b7:0xe6c5a2bc855579cf<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We got there at 10am only to find out the half of the park was closed. The price was $10, so we thought "why not?"  We got a seat easy enough and tubes for the slide tower. Only 1 out of 4 slides can be used without a tube. The tubes are huge. They say all attractions are available to anyone over 42 inches. When we get up the tower the life guards say our 5 year old son is too small to ride on the tube slides. He's 47 inches tall. That left us with 1 slide and a half power lazy river. No thanks. We got a refund and left. I can't recommend going until they do a major renovation.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The first water park that I ever felt like my kids were going to be perfectly ok if I wasn't physically watching them myself. The lifeguards are soooo attentive, and prompt in catching anything wrong (watched as some got tested). Water temp isn't bad (for someone who hates being cold at all). Food is pretty good at the snack bar and the drink bands are worth it. If you're doing a bday party (we have done one every year for my twins, for the past 4 years in a row) go for the extra hour before the park opens, totally worth it!<//Text>

<text>We camped within 20 minutes of The Wave most of the summer, so we bought season tickets for ourselves and our four grandchildren ages 3-12. For a small park, it is wonderful and was plenty of fun for our little group. We liked the food and thought it was reasonable in price with fun choices. The big boys loved everything. The little ones enjoyed the forest splash pad, the pool, and the lazy river. Summer weekdays were not overly crowded, but weekends were a bit squishy. We have great summer memories!<//text>< pics>

My kids have attended 4 summer camps and they like them. For me as a parent, the summer camps are very affordable and allow the kids to spend some fun time exercising (as opposed to playing video games on the couch). I have been there once for their Duck Race day when they had a $5 entrance special. It was fun, small and I felt that my kids were safe and not wandering off (Since it is small, there is only so many places one can go!). Now, for the bad. Some of the people who go here are not the most "refined" people and kids can be "rough", also, if you leave things unattended they might "disappear". So keep a close eye on your belongings or better yet bring your old stuff so nobody wants to take it. The Snack area also sells their left over food at the end of the day for $1, so that is great for feeding your hungry kids at the end of the day. There is also free parking. Overall, its a great waterpark for locals. Small and very affordable. Also, I recommend signing up for their email newsletter, that is how I heard about the $5 entrance special and got some excellent discounts on summer camps. I also think this is a better park for kids who are good swimmers or a bit older as opposed to very young kids.< /review>

<Review>The water park is fun and safe for kids age 5 and up and who swim.  My shortest cold was able to ride almost everything besides the wave rider.  The slides are fun but twice I saw kids get stuck in the rides inside the dark tubes.  They probably need to have a recommended weight to make sure that doesn't happen.  The pool is fun and has an extremely rapid change from 3 ft to 6.5ft so be aware.  The lazy River was fun and fast and even had a slide into it.  The food was generic and overpriced as is coming in most small and in fact even large theme parks.  It was worth it on Groupon but I wouldn't pay full price.<//Review>< Pics>

The Wave is a Vista CA, land mark. This place creates sparks of fun that spread to the largest wildfire of joy and laughter. This is no mere waterpark, this is an H20 adventure that is a place for families to grow together and discover and rediscover a childhood innocence that lie within us all. Please, set foot in the Wave Waterpark, and take a trip...a trip to nirvana.....

But yeah it's pretty cool.</text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>First visit here with my daughter and two grandsons.  The kids loved it!  However, I have a few observations:  First, the website stated absolutely no chairs, outside food or drinks or Brazilian bikinis.  We saw all of that.  I would have loved to have been able to bring snacks and drinks for the kids--as I saw many mothers do.  Will bring in whatever I want to next time.  Saw a girl in a skimpy butt-revealing bikini--she was there all day and sitting in front of us.  No one said anything to her.  Saw people bringing in backpack chairs.  Would have liked to have done that, too.  They need more shade.  We shared a palapa with a few others--good thing we got there early or we would have been out of luck.  Enjoyed the experience overall!</review><GmapID>0x80dc76a22916a3b7:0xe6c5a2bc855579cf<//GmapID><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Today was our first visit and the kids loved it. It is perfect for our one day, family staycation. We were there from 11-4. Perfect for kids 4-12 years old.
Pros: Nice staff, safety is their priority (lifeguards are literally everywhere), and cleanliness.
Cons: A bit busy (with summer camps) .
Altogether a very good experience for a reasonable price (thanks to Groupon).<//text>

<review>This waterpark is not worth the money! They won't let you wear goggles with the nose on cause they said a chemical will get stuck in, and instead, make you have to buy the small goggles which possibly every kid's head wont fit! And everything is strict, if you want to take your kids to a waterpark, dont choose this one of youre planning to take these type of goggles<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>Nice, small park for the small price. Perfect way to spend an afternoon if you're local.
Food is priced well, compared to other fast food, and not overly cheap tasting either.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc76a22916a3b7:0xe6c5a2bc855579cf< /Gmap_id></record>

Less crowded than expected. Great place to get out of the heat. More suited for families with kids in the young teen age range.</Text>

Great layout-- a mom can keep eyes on all areas from a beach chair.  Good mature lifeguarding staff and delicious offerings from snack bar.  Reasonably priced.< /review>

<Review>Have gone here tons of times! I always buy my tickets on Groupon for like $9 or $10. We have rented a Gazeebo a couple times but definitely not necessary if your willing to get there earlier in the day. They do have lounge chairs scattered throughout the park as well as a grassy area.<//Review><name>Barbara Hibbert<//name></record>

We had a really great afternoon here with our twins (almost 5 years old). Especially because they were allowed to do almost everything (except The Wave itself) which is not the standard in the US. Almost every other place they hardly can get allowed to do anything because they either are to small or to young. Here the life vests are included in admission, which is really good value at $17 for adults and $13 for kids. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The lifeguards were a tad annoying with their exaggerated walking forth and back and swaying their heads in a weird way that didn't seem to serve any purpose, but that's about it. Highly recommendable place for families with kids that can't or won't do high thrilling rides like most of the big water parks have them.</Text>

Not too many things to do with kids less then 42', my little one was devastated that she couldn't go a slide. Other wise was fine, lots of sitting spots, chose of 4 slides, lazy river. We visited in the middle of the week and it wasn't too crowded.</text>

It held just enough activities for all kids.  But 1 thing I felt it could have was a small children's pool, 2 ft deep.</text>

<user_name>Shell Bell< /user_name><Review>Horrible time, some guy came yelling about a roll of seats which the seat I sat on had nothing there, the manager came and automatically took their side, I try to explain that this guy is yelling and confrontational in front of everyone. If he spoke to me like a human being we could of got it resolved but apparently he has personal issues against African American s because his whole demeanor showed his ancestors, lol. The staff did not care what I had to say because every time I begun to speak the people would start talking and she turned to them shaking her head and agreed. On the 4th July 2017 "racism at it's best" this was my first and last experience at this park. Thanks for the history lesson you guys gave in front of my children and their friends, they will never forget that USA would never truly stop discrimination. Management and staff should have handled that differently.< /Review>< gmapID>

It would be better if it wasn't so crowded. Also, since it's small there aren't a lot of slides.<//text>

I was nervous switching my oldest sons dentist of which he’s had since he was two, but we moved to the AV almost 3 hours away from his dentist. I stumbled upon Dr. Kurian through a recommendation from an edwards airbase post. After reading the reviews I made the call and Stephanie was able to get me in rather quickly for my sons annual clean. I am so glad I made the call. Everyone in this office is AMAZING. You feel welcomed in a peaceful atmosphere rather than another patient in the waiting room. Dr. Kurian was very friendly and prompt. Highly recommend this dentist to anyone in the same boat as me of not knowing the area.< /text>

Daughters and I have been coming here for the last 2 years. Great dentist and staff. Dr Kurian is excellent with the kids and his staff is always nice and accommodating. One of the best dentist experiences I've had.<//review>

I had tooth sensitivity from a previously filled cavity from another dentist and they were able to tell from the X-rays it was under filled. And they fixed it! Dr. Kurian is all about advanced comfort while getting a filling. They have a TV where you can watch tv while they are doing dental work and noise cancelling headphones that hook up to the tv! Dr. Kurian and his staff are all about your comfort and how you are feeling. I’m definitely sticking with them and recommending everyone to them!<//review>< rating>

< Review>
I was not an existing patient but had heard great things about the office. They were extremely friendly and kind to my grandson with his first dentist appointment to where he looks forward to going. That was enough for me to become a patient. When I went the staff was very friendly , the office was welcoming and the Doctor was very friendly and created a calm and reassuring atmosphere which is very necessary in a dentist office. I highly recommend this dentist and staff.<//Review>

<review>I needed to find a new dentist now that I'm retired and the previous dentist location was in Santa Clarita. First Lancaster office visit was last week, received my base line review of my mouth. It's been over a year since my last check up due to Covid. The staff all protected me by wearing masks. The dentist did a thorough review of mouth and teeth. Cleaning has been scheduled and looking to get my teeth back to 100% healthy again.

Nice atmosphere. Patient appointments are spaced far enough apart that I didn’t come into contact with any others during my appointment. It was efficient and the staff was friendly. I was in and out without having to wait for anything.<//text>

Really nice experience at Les Kurian dentistry. Safe environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional staff, friendly, polite, and helpful. High tech dentistry with high quality pictures and 3d renderings of problem teeth. Les is really nice to work with. Very pleasant chair side manner. He explains what hes doing while he's doing it. No problems with pain during procedures. Highly recommended by me.

I have been a patient of Dr. Kurian for a good deal of time now so I feel comfortable in sharing my opinion. From the front office to the back office... From the always professional dental hygienists to the doc himself... I have been treated with respect and kindness.  I can't recommend his practice highly enough!</Text>

Dr. Kurian, and his staff have been our chosen place for our family for many years.  Dr. Kurian  has always made my children feel comfortable, and pain free.  The staff is also just as amazing, especially Nikki (office manager).  The team goes above, and beyond to make each and everyone to feel comfortable from the moment you walk in, until you walk out.  My number 1 choice by far.  Thank you all for treating us all like family!!!<//Review>

Very kind and helpful office staff.  They go above and beyond to help me and my 3 kids have a positive experience.  Dr. Kurian has never seemed rushed at any of our appointments. He always answers my questions thoroughly and takes time to explain what he is doing and why.  Doesn't seem to recommend a bunch of excess/ unnecessary treatments, either.< /Text>

<review>Dr Kurian gave me the best shot I've ever had. He is very gentle, patient and kind. His staff is great too! I will be bringing my whole family to him from now on, and would recommend him as a dentist that is trustworthy. :) THANKS!<//review><name>Alicia Rust</name></record>

Besides the office being beautiful and clean, the Staff and the Dr were both so very pleasant. Dr. Kurian was extremely patient and thorough. He answered all my questions and did not rush me out like other Dentists I have been to. Im very satisfied.< /Text>

Dr. Kurian's office is very nice and clean.  His staff is very nice.  Dr. Kurian was very nice and informative and I did not feel rushed through the exam.  While, the hygienist Michelle was very nice and did a great job cleaning my teeth, she went incredibly overboard about telling me how supposedly terrible my gums were, that my gums were bleeding so much "it was like a volcano", that I supposedly had bone loss, and she would classify that I had moderate gingivitis throughout the entire cleaning.  From the moment she walked in and looked at my x-rays to the moment I left.
Dr. Kurian said nothing about this when he examined me and said everything looked good and healthy. Michelle scaring the patient about how terrible their teeth, gums, dental health, etc supposedly are throughout the entire teeth cleaning process is excessive, unnecessary, and unprofessional. I already dislike going to the dentist and having to sit through the scare tactics during the entire cleaning only created more anxiety,  I don't get annoyed easily, but this really annoyed me and really did not make me want to return to this office.  The hygienist also did not do any kind of probing procedure used for actually measuring the pocket depths in the gums to determine levels of gum receding or gingivitis.  Every other dentist I've gone to, has done this procedure, but the hygienist at Dr. Kurian's office did not.  Michelle's conversation throughout my cleaning was loud enough to be heard by the other office employees and therefore loud enough to be heard by anyone else in the office.  It did not provide much in the way of patient privacy and was at the least, very unprofessional and possibly a HIPPAA violation. Whether it were true or not, I certainly wouldn't want all of the rest of the office staff and any other patients in the surrounding areas to know that I was "bleeding like a volcano" or anything else for that matter. Other dentists I've gone to before Dr. Kurian have never said anything like this to me or anything that was cause for concern.  Yet, my first visit here and they're already signing me up for extra cleanings to burn through what my insurance will cover and then have me paying out of pocket for extra services. The appointment and exam was going very well until my experience with Michelle the hygienist.  It is because of that experience that I will most likely not return to Dr. Kurian and will look for another dentist to go to.  This is disappointing because I liked everything else about my experience at Dr. Kurian's office.</Text>

Wedding Dress Alterations

I had a great experience with Elan Image. I needed to have 3 dresses altered, a wedding dress, a rehearsal dress and a bridesmaid dress. Lydia was able to squeeze me in during peak prom season and managed to alter all three of my dresses in less than a week and a half! The consultation was quick and the work was extremely high quality. There are several options in Davis that could alter your dresses, but I highly doubt any other spot will bring the quality and attention to detail that Elan Image will provide you.< /text>

I'd never been to a tailor before, but needed to get a dress fitted for an upcoming formal event and am so glad I discovered Elan Image.  Lydia is very professional and I am very happy with the high quality work!  Prices are very reasonable and my dress fit perfectly.  Received many compliments.  I plan to bring some other dresses in.  Highly recommended!< /review>

Great experience with Elan Image!  We had an unusual request for an alteration to my daughter's winter coat, and they worked with us to adapt it just for her.  Very pleased with the result!  Price was extremely reasonable, and it was finished within a week.  We will definitely be back for future needs!</Review>

<Text>Lovely woman runs this place. Very quick and professional consultation, plus excellent service and reasonable pricing. Turnaround time was excellent as well with an additional piece even being waived rush charge. The items turned out beautifully and fit me very well now. Definitely would recommend to a friend.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80852975104af645:0xabc14a6a4e2fb055<//Gmap_id><user_name>Yumi Temple< /user_name></record>

<review>Lydia was awesome. She altered my wedding dress, and put in several bustles. She clearly knows a lot about garment construction, fabric, and cleaning. I was able to speak to her about the whole thing and get great advice for my wedding day look. I really appreciate all that she did and she did it on time. Originally, she set me up for three bustles, but my dress was so heavy she added two more for a total of five. Even though I paid for three, it was more important that the job be done right. She even fixed some beading at no extra charge. My dress looks and fits fantastic. Thanks Lydia!<//review>< Name>

<text>I took my wedding dress to Elan Image to be hemmed and let out. They did a beautiful job quickly (2 weeks). I was charged a little over $100 for the service, but I don't know how that compares to other places as I do not go to tailors often.  Very trustworthy business.</text><Time>1487973569238< /Time>< Response>

Wonderful experience. Recently moved to Davis from LA. Read reviews and thought I'd start here. Made apt to bring in a large pile of things. The suggestions made for alterations and work done has allowed me to revisit a large part of my closet. I had clothes repaired, hems reinforced, pants hemmed, and waists altered so pants don't gap or slide down. All work was excellent and was actually ready earlier than the pickup date. Happy to find them!!!!<//review>

I brought Executive Alterations a suit, two blazers, and a dress shirt to be tailored. Lydia did an excellent job with the alterations. The prices are high but the quality is top notch and well worth it. I will definitely return with anything else that I need altered. Thanks Lydia!<//review>

Lydia delivered modern style recommendations to improve my professional wardrobe. She closed the 10% gap on 90% fitted business casual and professional attire. Adjusted sleeve lengths, darted shirts, took in jacket waists, properly set pant breaks. Now 100% styled, off to NY! :)< /Review>

I've had several pants and a suit tailored here, all to complete satisfaction.  Ms. Chu is great.  She's very professional and candid.  Exactly what I want in someone who is helping me look a little less foolish.<//text>

<Text>Professional, timely, reasonably priced, and does fantastic work. My daughter needed a flower girl dress shortened, and it was completed with attention to detail and sincere friendliness that was much appreciated by a 9-yo girl who hates dresses. ;)< /Text><userid>111525775037183951836< /userid>< pictures>

<Review>Absolutely amazing! I had a vintage Burberry trench coat altered here and it turned out perfect! You can't even tell that it has been altered and I have received tons of compliments. I'll be bringing my wedding dress here to be altered and I am sure it will turn out beautiful.<//Review>< gmapID>

The only thing nicer than their store front is the service provided within. For a reasonable upcharge, they were accommodating despite my very tight alteration turnaround request (1 day). If I wasn't moving out of the area soon I would definitely be a longtime customer. Enlist their services with confidence, you won't be sorry.< /review>

They did an excellent job tailoring a new suit that didn't quite fit right off the shelf. One week later and it looks like it was custom made for me! A bit on the pricey side, but worth every last cent.< /Text>

I felt discriminated against going here. She didn't want to sew my pants because she didn't feel like it, and said the holes were "too big". Before she even walked up though she mentioned something about not wanting to do it, so I'm not sure if that was an excuse or not. I would avoid this place.<//Review>

<Text>I was recommended to this place by a couple people for alterations on my wedding dress: I had to lose a little length, get the waistline tucked in and have the bustline (it had boning) a little tweaked. It turned out perfect! The price was less than I expected as well. Thanks Lydia!! If I ever need alterations on anything again I am going here no questions.< /Text>< pics>

I had three skirts, two pants , and two dresses altered by Lydia and I couldn't be more pleased with the work that was done .  Some of the changes were quite complicated ,but she did an excellent job .  It has made me so happy to have such reliable place to go to because , as I age , I have gotten shorter and I have lost some weight so a lot of my clothing is going to need alterations .<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The times I've been in to see Lydia, they were to get alterations for very formal attire. In spite of my nervousness, Lydia was very patient. And when I was confused why something didn't fit right, Lydia was is a genius at determining the cause and fixing it. Every time I've been to Executive, I've waited until the absolute last minute, and every time she has rushed the alterations so that they are ready in time for my event. I highly recommend her to prospective customers.<//review>< Pics>

Made the switch from a more mainstream gym to Ultimate Fitness. And I must say, best decision I’ve made! My overall physical health took a downturn even before COVID, and their their personal training staff have been phenomenal. I’ve made so many leaps in improving my strength and endurance. This place is truly one of the best gyms in San Diego!< /Text>

<review>After the closure of the major gym that I was a member of, due to Covid, I was in need of a new home. I saw this place on Google and went to go check it out. They were blasting Breaking Benjamin when I arrived and that's when I knew that I was in the right place. It's a great place to get those gains</review><Time>1615392654417<//Time>< gmap_id>

I can tell it'll be really great once things return to some semblance of normal, it's a huge space & looks like it can offer alot!< /text>< Pictures>

Been to a few gyms, this one so far is the best, it's not a big chain. And that's a good thing. The staff, Houston,  Stetson and Lily are THE BEST any quest they have they will answer or get you the answer.  Realistic and affordable is a big deal at Ultimate Fitness not the big Chain pricing and B.S. policies.  And recently added a retail supplement shop Drake and Christian are great.  Thanks everyone.< /Text>

<Review>I've gone to the gym twice after signing up. I signed up on Thursday along with a friend. It's a amazing gym, it's not super big like our neighbor planet fitness but, the staff is very nice and have a positive attitude. It's also kid friendly and that's why I come! I could walk in without a parent, scan in and put in work! Very good gym and I recommend anyone to it!</Review><rating>5</rating><userid>117335914637999662138</userid><Date>1495941473416</Date><Resp>{'time': 1537707079705, 'text': 'Thank you for your support!!!

I've been going to this gym for about two years now and I have got to say it's like coming home to a second family. It's amazing that after so long that yes, some of the staff do change but not the great service that is given. I love this gym and it's even better when you come back to see your friends!<//Review>

I was looking for a serious, no-nonsense gym with a good vibe. When I walked in Lily hooked me up with a free 1-day pass, and boy am I hooked. You dont need headphones as they play good music. Staff Is friendly as well.<//review>

<review>It has everything you need at this gym. It is not so busy at the times I want to go to gym which is perfect for me. The biggest problem which is not difficult to fix is the music. It's very stressful and other people have also mentioned that to me before. Also, they need to fix a few straps on a few machines and they need more padding for the squat machines. Otherwise it's great for what I need to do.</review>< Time>

If you are shy or get embarrassed when people look at you . This is the perfect gym.  It's not a fashion show gym.  The Staff is friendly, Good Music and Energy.</Review>

Yes it's not your typical gym. Got to admit I was upset when they closed thier 3rd ave. Site. I joined them because they had the pool. Thats the only negative I have about this gym. Otherwise I have nothing but positive comments.
Thier focus is on core specific classes. They Also have great Zumba classes. My favorite instructor is Blanca. They have rowing machines, elliptical trainers, Stair masters, punching bags, tires to hit and flip. There is so much variety it's really hard to burn out at this gym. Not to mention al of the weights in the weight room. I love this gym I'm very comfortable here. My 3  son's and husband and I all have a membership here. I highly recommend this gym if your looking for a gym with lots of variety!<//text>

<review>My name is Bret Sackett, 15 years ago we adopted our dog Franklin from Animal Friends and am sorry to say that we lost Franklin today due to cancer he developed in his right rear leg. I don't think I have ever had a dog that brought so much happiness and good memories into our home, everyday was something new, some sort of way he found to entertain us. We are going to miss him and the good times he shared with us. I want to thank Pat for giving us the opportunity to bring Franklin into our home and be a part of my family, a true family member, no doubt about it, we loved Franklin and will never forget him. I would also like to thank not only Pat, but her entire staff as well, the people that work and care for these animals makes them all heroes to me. Thank you again for 15 years with Franklin.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

Spoke to Victoria,
She gave me the most helpful information.
You can tell she actually cares about what she does everyday.
Extremely helpful, kind and thoughtful.
I’ve been reading some of the reviews for this place and maybe instead of complaining why wouldn’t you want help a non-profit organization like this?
You can tell they don’t have enough funding?
DONATE what you can.
It’s not always about money.
Blankets, toys, food, medical supply’s if you have any Hollie that and can help why wouldn’t you?
Maybe the place might smell a little like urine, it’s a shelter!
They’re clearly doing the best they can with the resources they have.
I’ve really never understood people that always complain but have no suggestions or solutions to help fix the problem.
You can tell they are definitely using their better judgment on who is actually qualified and who’s not when allowing people to adopt.
Positivity brings productivity.
Maybe next time you call or go for a visit, have a kinder disposition?
Project your manners onto them?
Please and thank you like you were taught.
Be helpful and I guarantee you, you’ll have a much better response.
I am grateful for these hard working people.
I think they’re doing the best they can every single day.
Stress is normal for such an occupation.
I know I couldn’t do it.
Thank you Staff!<//review>

This place asks you for a book full of information, then never gets back to you to let you know what the status is.   If you call, they either don't answer or brush you off to their website. So unfortunate for great families trying to adopt a pet. I would never use them again.< /Review>

Please donate whatever you can. They need old towels for baths etc!
I dropped off some new Kong dog toys for the doggies. Poor babies.
This is a wonderful place for animals.  Bless the people who work there!   ❤<//text>

We rescued an abused dog here and they did the utmost to try and give her above and beyond an opportunity for her to have a restored leg that was damaged so badly. I’m so grateful they care this much for these hurting animals. The commitment is to their core.
Thank you so much Patricia and Randi.
We love our little girl so much.

****Please donate****
As much and as often as you can,  they need help in these hard times to help these poor animals. The caring hasn’t stopped even as finances have been next to none compared to the need.< /Text>

If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. I applied for a dog almost a week and a half ago. I then followed up with a call to them so I could talk to the person in charge of adoptions. I was asked a lot of questions by the person who answered the call and then said that more than likely my application would be rejected due to the dog being left alone for 4-7 hours since I have to go to work, despite the fact that I have a dog already to keep this one company. The next time I called, apparently the same person answered and when I asked for the adoption coordinator, said that she could help me and said that the hours being left alone wouldn't matter if I was a match and had another dog. The third time I called, the same lady said that they still hadn't looked at the applications for that particular dog. Once she realized who was calling and once I started insisting on speaking to the adoption coordinator, she became extremely rude to me. I gave up on this dog and we were able to adopt another dog from a different shelter and he's now basking in our love. As for the dog that I was interested in from this shelter - the poor thing is still up for adoption two weeks later! Had they cared about the animals at all, this poor dog would've been at her forever home at least 1.5 weeks ago and finding herself loved by a family that has a lot of love to give!<//review>

<text>Although I didn't adopt a here, my experience was very positive. The staff are accommodating, very knowledgeable about their animals, and seem to genuinely care about each and every ones well being. I wish one of their kitties had been more suited for my home but I know they'll find good homes thanks to this organization.</text><gmapID>0x809a9fffbb207653:0x9ea67378e9575dfb< /gmapID><user_id>107063262358780295343</user_id></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT ADOPT HERE! So I'm starting from the beginning. I'm looking for a chihuahua. I see a dog named dusty on  adoptapet.com. So I ask my family what they think about the dog they're all on board! So I'm a first-time owner I search up everything. After I search for all the stuff I want to know how the adoption aplication is.  I went to their website to the adoption application. The first thing I see is invasive things like "We reserve the right to visit the home where the dogs will be residing prior to adoption". etc. They ask a lot of invasive questions. Why do you need to know about my kids? Don't really care about that at that time but deff was a red flag and i should've paid attention. I get a sense of what the application is like. Then today I write an email at 10 AM.  8 hours no reply. I thought maybe my business email was only letting contact my coworkers. So I do a test from my personal email to by business email. It works so they were just too lazy to email me back. So I google the place and they open at 11 AM. Most likely Meaning that they saw my email. I look at the reviews and it seems like the place sucks. Then I go on yelp and see that this place is not a place to adopt from. Then l go on their website and see that dusty isn't up for adoption and that he got adopted. My families devastated. They are so unprofessional. I will admit that I was pretty stupid trying to adopt from a third party website. But adopt a pet has a feature to let people know the dogs adopted or just delete it. Also don't believe that they are a non-profit organization and that you have to do just an interview.  They charge $300 dollars for dogs.</Review>

My wife and I had just recently suffered a miscarriage and were looking to adopt a young puppy. We stumbled upon a cute little pug/chihuahua mix named Bentley and immediately fell in love. I began talks with the staff at animal friends connection to see how adoption procedures were conducted. We were told that the foster parents were bringing his brothers to be adopted later in the week and we asked if we could meet him. They told us yes. They then provided us with requirements to be able to adopt young Bentley and gave us a time to come meet him. Two days before the time we are able to even meet Bentley, let alone adopt him, we received an email stating that our household of just me and my wife were not a right fit as we do not have any other dogs currently in the household. That Bentley needs a play buddy such as an older dog. We didn’t even get to meet the foster parent, staff, nor Bentley and it was determined that we were not a right fit. We do not feel as though this is good business practice for adoptions. We will not be using this service again.</Review>

Although I was not  there to adopt a pet. I did spend quite some time there. And if you are looking to adopt a pet (dogs & cats) Then this is the place to go. I am a dog person and did  not really care for cats until this visit. I spent most of the time in "The Cat room" Where the most beautiful and caring woman to have the pleasure of knowing was there caring for the cats. Victoria who has worked there for a few months now is so good with the cats. Its like she has been there for years. I now call her The Cat Whisperer. I got to know some of the cool cats there Some are friendly, some are scared , some are rude And some are over friendly. And they all have one thing in common. They want to be loved  So if you need a cool cat go there and check them out. Thank you Victoria for an awesome time hanging with the cats And of course you. Peace< /Text>

They are very helpful and are on there to help  animals in any way they can. I have taken given up a couple animals to them in the past and they took such great care with fixing and adopting out. They are taking care of the animals who need homes while preventing them from having more. It's a win/ win in my eyes. I'm glad someone told me about them.</Review>

<review>i Called on a pet I heard about. The lady said all of their dogs run $300-$350. They say they are non-profit?!?!?. The place smells of urine and feces! The dogs are peeing and pooping on floor and they don’t care. Dogs infested with fleas. Something is wrong here! How can a place operate in a place that can’t house animals safely and clean? I know that services are donated but a photographer? Some pictures of dogs are professionally done. I love animals and are thankful to people that foster and provide adoptions. Some dogs are there for months because of the high adoption fees.< /review>< Pics>

I adopted a kitten in 2008--sadly, he died in 2012, but I had stayed in touch with the fine volunteers of AFC through volunteering and friendship. This month, I adopted a pair of kitties from them because this group is fighting an uphill battle to find good homes for so many animals. They do a wonderful job and give so much love to the cats and dogs of San Joaquin county.</text>

Animal Friends Connection is an incredible organization.  The staff is wonderful and you can truly see how much they care for all the animals there.  We were fortunate enough to be referred to them in 2015 by a family member who adopted from them and we adopted a wonderful puppy.  We have now gone back for the second time and adopted another puppy from them.  They definitely want to make sure the dogs and cats are  placed in the right homes and that there is no risk of them ending up on the street again.  These people have huge hearts and do a great job caring for all the fur babies.  Thanks AFC!!< /review>

I remember i tried adopting a black terrier named princess from here summer of 2017 i got to meet her and hold her in my arms the staff took me through the process of adopting her and said that in a week we could have her. I waited a week and my parents finally called them after waiting a few extra days for them to CALL US and some staff member told us that another employee had let another family adopt her!! I was absolutely devastated! These people seriously need to have a better work ethic<//Text>

<text>I think it's terrible that all these "rescues" take all the adoptable pets and charge huge amounts of money and make you jump through hoops to adopt. Shame on you! I'm going to the shelter and giving one of the unprofitable dogs an incredible home!<//text>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I sent asked for an application about a month ago and got one a couple days later. The application said you have to be no younger then 12 years to go by yourself, so lucky for me because I am 12. Then I went in about a month later with my mom and one of ladies Mary ( who was extremely helpful and nice) showed me were to sign up days. So I signed up for the next day, which was Saturday when they walk dogs. My dad, mom and I then went the next day and one of the ladies said that they are in the middle of updating their site and application paper. Then she said that when you are  12 they need to have someone to walk with them and that they don't do back round checks to make sure they r not dangerous.< /Review><user>113298642496314919951< /user><name>Eva Baja<//name>< response>

(Btw this is a long review)I've been volunteering at animal friends connection for about a year now and my family has been fostering dogs for them for a while and they have been wonderful! Most of the complaints are things like they didn't get the animal the wanted, the smell,or the time it took to get the dog. First of all they choose who they think would be best for the dogs. They want them taken care of, to be inside so they aren't neglected, and they don't want an abusive  home. The questioning may seem strict but it was from their heart and love for the animals. You may be mad that you didn't get the animal but they aren't rude they just want a good home. Also its NOT first come first serve they pick who the board thinks would take good care of the animal. They also check your backyard to make sure its fenced in and they aren't going to be put back on the street. If you have a super tiny backyard that no dog can run in and you want a big German Shepard or any other large dog that needs to run, then they most likely aren't going to adopt to you because that poor dog won't be able to exercise. The smell: you can't make a free run animals shelter have no smell of urine or cleaning supplies. Even tho they try to immediately clean up the pee doesn't mean they can watch every dog in there to make sure there's no pee smell.
The ladies hat worj there are super busy making sure all there animals are in the website, getting certain animals and fosters to events, and cleaning up/taking care of Avery animal when there are no volunteers.< /text>

My fiancé and I came in, looking for a dog we saw online. We met him and really wanted to take him home. We filled out an application for the dog and was told we would be contacted  soon. A few days went by and still nothing. So I gave them a call to see what was going on. I was told that the application was still being looked at and that they would again be in touch. It has now been two weeks since we looked at that dog and have heard nothing back from them. I hate to write a bad review because I believe all the dogs there should find a great home, but if the people there want their dogs adopted, why would you not give someone a call that WANTS THE DOG! Don't read my review and decide that you don't want to adopt from here, please do if you find a dog. Just be aware that they might not call you back and you will be left wondering what the heck happened! This isn't how they should act if they want their dogs to go to a good home.</Text>

<resp>None</resp><text>Called today to ask about surrendering my cat, or to ask for guidance on what could be done.  Initially the lady answered the phone, as I started to talk, 10 seconds in (not right away) she said LET ME PUT YOU ON HOLD THANKS, no pause, no interruption, no agreement - Just pure rudeness.  When she gets back on the line, I call and ask her what to do, try to explain the circumstances, and AGAIN she cuts me off and says "SO ARE YOU TRYING TO SURRENDER YOUR CAT OR WHAT, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE SANCTUARY IS FULL" and starts giving me snarky, rude fake empathy.  If you're going to answer the phone at a place that has a cat sanctuary, and just give me rude answers, and cut me off not one, but twice, maybe it's time to find a new job - Like at a the DMV.  Unbelievable they have someone like this woman answering the phones.  I don't know what her name was, but it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had, especially when dealing with something like getting rid of a pet - Not because you want to, but because you have to.  I hope your front office gets cleaned up.< /text>< date>

Rude people running this place won't ever go back. Took our neighbors to buy a dog they looked at them and said they didn't have a dog to fit them. They had to buy 2 dogs which they were and had the cash on hand and still they didn't sell them a dog. Racist people..our friends are Portuguese glad to say the church gave them a dog and the donated $2000 to the church!! There lost, the churches gain..< /Review>

While I can genuinely appreciate what this company is doing for animals, they are far from what I would consider a quality adoption or rescue center. My wife and I were in search of a smaller breed, preferably under a year old, and we had seen a few posts online of some potential new furry friends. So we wanted to pay them a visit. First, to even be considered, you have to go through more questions in their application than for the US Military, some absolutely absurd... I understand why, as some new owners dont always make the best pet owners, and conditions can be less than savory... but quite frankly, that's your business, not a rescue centers... if you're looking for a pet, get your stuff together and make sure youre capable of giving them the love and environment they deserve. Back to this place, we arrived without a demanded appointment, and upon entering, the entire place had a smell worse than the dirtiest of county animal shelters. Employees/volunteers sneered up from their phones to give my wife and child a look of disgust when they spat some b.s. opinion of what they think is right and wrong when it came to dogs. Behind the counter, some dogs were stacked in kennels while others were able to mosey around and leave little trails of puddles and piles while employees shrugged it off. Most of the dogs were dirty, some looked malnourished (even after supposedly being there over a month), and the selection was not exactly diverse as far as breeds go. What these people do is use your questionnaire to decide FOR YOU what you get to adopt... but adopt isn't really the right word... it's more like walking into a car dealer knowing what you can afford and want to drive home in, and the car salesman will only sell you the POS because that's his opinion of what you should be driving. Needless to say we found a nice little 2mo old purebred pup online for the same price as shiesty adoption for a dog we "didnt fit", and life is good. If you want a new furry friend from here, brace yourself for the entourage of mind blistering questions that are hyper-invasive on what would normally be a very pleasant experience.< /Text>

this place is scary and I am considering reporting them to the heAlth department. the place smelled like urine so bad it made my eyes water. the little dogs running loose in the reception area were not very well groomed.  one of the dogs was really comfortable jumping back and fourth over the gate. there was no real effort from anyone to explain how their adoption program worked.

appartly their screening process is to bring out a dog that they know acts out with agression around strAngers and see if she nips at you,  if she does then you must be a bad person.  nevermind the trauma that this causes the dog. who should only be introduce to strangers in a calm safe space.

I asked severAl times if I could go out back to see the bigger dogs and never really got a straight answer from anyone.

also One of the little dogs had the type of fur tends to matt up behind the ears she had a bump under one little matt that was kind of sensitive. when I pointed this out they acted like they were checking it but didn't really look at it.

on one of the other little dogs  I saw a flea crawling around but he did not seem to be infested (no eggs or fresh  dermatitis. meaning they likely treat with frontline or something simlar and the bedding is likely)

the urine smell was starting to making me feel sick and I really needed to wash hands. I asked if there was a rest room and th
was told no and directed to go to mcdonalds.

I also did not see a hand washing sink any where(which is a health code violation, one of many) not did I see any one use hand sanitiser between kennel maintinace and feeding the animals. I suspect they don't let people out in the back kennels because they are worse then the incredible filthy kennels in the front. these people haven't got a clue about universal precautions.

I have hand sanitizer in my car thank goodness.  I am concerned about the conditions the dogs are being kept in here. I hope yesterday was just a bad day for them.

Really good fruit and yogurts. Prices are getting high though that's the only down side.< /Text>

<Review>My concern was the hygiene. I saw her use the same gloves to collect money and then prepare food.  Staff has no basic cross contaminatoon knowledge.  She also was not wearing the mask appropriately-(below her nose) I was unable to enjoy food purchased -money wasted. Owners should provide staff with more education around this subject.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I didn't even like raspados or yogurt with trigo(is that how you spell it? Never had this before but it's very unique and tasty) until I tried these..Now I'm ADDICTED! ALL their flavors for their raspados are so refreshing and delicious. I've tried about 5 or 6 different flavors so far and all are amazing. It doesn't taste artificial at all! I asked the owner what he does different and he just said he "uses real fruits and nuts" to make his raspados. So glad to hear a business takes pride in the materials they use and not depend on artificial food. The yogurts are like nothing I've had before, so easy on my stomach since I'm lactose intolerant, and I've never had a problem. Sweetest family you'll ever meet and they truly appreciate their customers. I felt it's time to write a post since I go almost daily. Their menu is wonderful and you can try something new every time and love it. Thank you Barrancos fruit! You're my new go to for any snacks! Especially in this heat!</review>< username>

< review>
What should you call soup that is neither hot nor sour? I don't know. I'm not in advertising, but I'm thinking anything but "hot and sour soup" would work.

Might I suggest tasteless-spiceless slime soup? I've had about a million bowls in my life, but im actually impressed how something so full of ingredients can be so bland.

Lots of good reviews so im guessing I just picked poorly.

Edited because autocorrect</review>

Terrible experience. Extremely mismanaged and the entire restaurant shows it, staff doesnt care, service so slow went to get my own water, no one knew who was taking our order, over 1.5 hrs from sitting to when food arrived and order was wrong. The restaurant shows it age  bathrooms dirty, carpet dirty, just do yourself a favour and forget this place entirety.< /review>

This is the best place to have authentic Chinese food. The staff is very friendly and helpful with whatever food as per your choice. If you let them know right combination of what is required they will get it done. Green beans, fried rice, tofu, sweet corn soup and Chinese pan cake was the order. The food was hot and the taste was authentic as you get the Chinese food. It's not too costly.. The interiors are red as Chinese restaurants are always looking.<//review>

Food was ok. Our food arrived at different times so some of it was cold by the time we ate. Service was ok. Need to teach their busboy to not bang dishes together when putting them on the cart to take to the kitchen.< /Text>

<Text>Horrible. I know not all the workes are at fault but at least 80% of the time I have ordered here they get my order wrong. I believe it's the cooks. When you order a beyond burger usually that means you DONT EAT MEAT so that means don't add BACON! Multiple times this has happend . Today I had to return my burger 3 times for it being made incorrectly.  My lunch time was over so I just asked for my money back and left with no food. I'm extremely disappointed with the service I received.
This is my first written complaint ever. I hope they can get it together . If it wasn't for this location being close to my work I would not have continued going. Will not be returning.<//Text>< Rating>

Some great coupons have been sent out in the mail these past few months; they've been especially good for satisfying two people.</Text>

I honestly do enjoy the burgers at Carl's Jr., But the thing that I have an issue with is the price. I always end up spending much more than I anticipated at each of these locations, for decent food. That being said, the beef they use is of the best quality in a fast food restaurant that serves burgers.</text>

Pretty fast solid food, cooked up and served with gusto.  I have to admit they've got a fairly broad menu with burgers, chicken, fish, and sides. Their bfast deals are a nice surprise, especially that "2 biscuits for $2.50"...I really enjoy their biscuits.</text>

Love this place, wish they'd bring back 2 for 6 western bacon cheeseburgers though. Those are honestly my favorite over anything else that we ever get here. So happy when the burger started being eaten, it was like heaven. I hope my wife starts cooking again, otherwise I'll be at Carl's a lot more!</review>

It was a very hot day when the wife and I stopped by to grab a quick something to take home for dinner.  I checked the time, and noted it was 1:PM and we opted to go in side to order hoping it would be a cooler inside.  I ordered a chicken salad and she ordered a standard burger with fries.  My first surprise was Carl's charges $1.00 for the privilege of using my debit card.  Fortunately, I can use the credit card method and they cannot charge me for that.  The order was quickly placed and we sat down to wait for our meal.  I noted it was now 1:05 PM.  We sat and watched as the time went by and eventually we got our food.  At the time of delivery, I looked at my watch again and noted the time was now 1:25PM.  20 minutes to toss a salad and cook up a burger?  When we got home, I sat down to eat the salad and noted it had 3 one inch pieces of chicken sitting on top.  I felt ripped off.  Carl's applies what amounts to a 10 percent tax to your order if you use your debit card, they make you wait 20 minutes for a simple order, and they cheat your order when you finally get it.  I will never do business in this establishment again, nor will I recommend to any of my friends or relatives.<//text>

This location used to offer Green Burrito food selections now those selections are gone. I went through the drive through 10 minutes before their advertised closing time and they were already closed for the night.</Review>

<Text>I love Carl's Jr. Give me a Super Star with cheese and onion rings and I'm good. I love their charbroiled burgers. And the chocolate cake with that delicious white frosting! As far as I'm concerned, the food is great though a bit pricey for fast food.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

When we watched her make the order she used a fry container,  not the proper scoop. To gather our fries , then dumped them into each box loose. Then she put the container aside to use again. My wife asked why do u dump the fries in the box. She replied that's the way they are. No the photo shows a fry container with fries. Which would have been more sanitary than using a used fry cup as a scoop and dumping them out in box. She was very rude turned her shoulder and shrugged us off. Worst Carl's experience ever.

No matter how many times I say the word "extra" before sauce on my burger, it's always dry. Whatever happened to "If it doesn't get all over the place..."? It's insulting really. Seams to only be this location.<//Review>

The manager that was working window was so rude. My friend wanted to change her meal to a combo and there was no line and she said should of told her sooner. Then when I reached out and handed her my card she said too far and threw my orange juice. I respectfully asked for my card back and drove off.</Review>

Tonight I received very bad service while in the drive through the lady I can't pronounce her name her name started with that letter I was very short when taking your order with a very bad attitude after getting up to the window they asked me to pull around to the front I waited roughly about 8 minutes for them to bring my order out they forgot two of my items when I went into the store to tell them , the lady whom assuming was the manager had a smile on her face and said oh we forgot your zucchini I explain to her you also forgot the chicken strips and I explain to her your attitude was very bad she might want to change her attitude and the service was terrible because, I had to walk back inside the store after waiting 8 minutes for my order. so yes very unpleased with this location I'm not the first person that's had a problem with this location. I've been told by a few different people that that was the worst Carl's jr. They've ever been to. I guess it was my turn to experience it. So if their business unit review some of these. they might want to change the management culture at that particular location. something they're going wrong.<//Text>

I ordered a monster Biscuit Sandwich,  got home and they totally forgot the sausage pattie in the Sandwich.
I called the manager with the complaint,
She took my information and and replaced my Sandwiches  at no charge.
My original order was free since it was wrong.</Text>

Every time I go to this Carl's Jr drive thru, they ask me to drive around to the front of the building and wait. More often than not, I am waiting 5 -10 minutes. I have to walk in and go to the counter to get my food and they still ignore me.  By the time I get my food it is cold. One day, I asked the manager why they do this. The manager got rude and nasty saying they have the right to do that. It's their store policy she says. I won't be going back to this Carl's.< /text>

She said next time you order you need  to tell me you have a coupon so I can let to cooks know (RUDELY), she closes the window... Me and my son look at each other like what the hell!!! So she comes back w/ my card and receipt and I asked why would you need to tell the cooks I have a coupon, ( If looks could kill I would be dead) well they need to know and it's for all of us to know it makes it easier for us OK! Pull to the front! So we are in the front waiting for are food thinking of what they are doing to it...this isn't the first time we had RUDE customer service at this La Sierra Riverside Carl's but it is the last!!! It's not worth the hassle or worry if someone's spitting in are food! By the way the quality of the food is poor... My husband got The Mile High Bacon Burger thinking it would look like the picture (NOT) It had like bacon bits, not bacon strips...judge for yourself!</Review><date>1414343347629< /date>< Rate>

<text>They screwed up my order, then when I came back to talk to them they stated well we didn't hear it but to fix your order they would have to charge me an extra $2. Very upsetting how lazy the manager is.</text>< name>

I ordered big carl combo which is $6.19. but they charged : $2.81, $1,89 and $1.69.
total came out to $6.39.... $0.20 more. I complained, they said they did not do anything wrong because it's all in the computer. anyway, I got my 20 cents back but maybe thats the reasons they usually don't give out the reciept and seperate the charges. so, be aware!</text>
