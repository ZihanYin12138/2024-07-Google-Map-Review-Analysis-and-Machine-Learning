Great quality food at a reasonable price. You can watch them prepare the food and it looks to be clean and fresh ingredients.

I tried the beef chicken swarma which were both tasty and tender. The hummas and grape leaves were also very good. Seating inside and out.</review>

<text>Stopped by today for lunch. The service was fast and friendly. Had the chicken kebab platter and the chicken was absolutely delicious. You can tell it’s family owned and the chef was very nice and gracious enough to step out to our table to ask how everything was. The rice could use a little more flavor/salt but the delicious and moist chicken and well dressed salad made up for it. Also, their hummus was so good and acidic which I love.</text>< Pics>

Their baba ganoush was incredible, and falafel was very filling, pretty nice atmosphere too, it's small but has good character, definitely eating here again!</Review>

Both were on the smallish size for a Lebanese sandwich, but were very flavorful. Pick the salad as a side. It has some tasty spices and the fries are a little floppy.<//review>< pics>

As a person who is very critical of Arabic food, I can say without doubt that this is one of the best and most authentic middle eastern food places in San Diego. Often times restaurants claim to be middle eastern but they serve garbage. If you truly want to experience Lebanese home authentic cooking , this is the place to go. They put love into there food as is the Arab custom when feeding guests. On top of how amazing the food is, they are beyond reasonably priced. If you want a taste of home or just try authentic Arabic cuisine at its finest, then you have to try Karam’s !<//review>

< Review>
The best part was the owner, who we got to know a little bit. He seems very nice, and the place seems very authentic. There were very cool decor, and had a nice homey atmosphere inside.

However, I'm unhappy to say that we did not get the stellar Mediterranean food that everyone has been raving about. Our beef shawarma was bland. The tahini was runny. There was a side of limp fries that look like they have been previously frozen and simply reheated, not seasoned. They could have done so much more with the fries (added feta, or some special sauce) but chose to make them as sad-looking as possible.

For the price that we paid, we were expecting higher quality in food.< /Review>

<Text>This place has a small cozy feel to it and the menu reflects that. You won't find a huge selection on their menu, but what they do have on their are all great choices. No matter what you choose whether the chicken shwarma, beef shwarma, a plate, a sandwich, or just some freshly made hummus and bread, they are all good choices.

The food is not too salty nor is it lacking in flavor. The meals hit the spot  and are made fairly quick. The drink selection is limited to bottled and canned drinks but if you came here for the food then that's hardly a gripe. I'm still waiting for them to add a breakfast menu, but in the meantime their delicious lunch menu can suffice for brunch.<//Text>< Resp>

I tried this place for the first time. It was a spur of the moment choice. I think I stumbled upon a hidden gem. The food was very flavorful and was obviously fresh. I got tabouli (wheat, tomato, parsley, green onions and mint drizzled with fresh lemon and olive oil) it would be easy to tell if a dish like this wasn't fresh. I also got chicken shawarma which was also good. I'll be coming back for sure.<//Text>

Outstanding service, good food, no air-conditioning, nice restroom, but toilet tank takes a long time to refill.  This is a very small place, with one table inside for more than 3 people, multiple tables for 2-3.  Couple more larger tables on the patio. We and our friends had a gyro wrap, chicken kabob, beef schawerma and chicken schawerma.  All were very good.  The schawermas were a bit dry, but had good char. Portions were good.  They charge $1.25 for sauces like tzaziki, garlic, spicy garlic, etc., but prices are pretty reasonable.  Salad had good quality greens. They supplied us with pitchers of ice water.  Lots of take-out business, and that's a good idea on a hot day.< /Text>

Amazing service from their staff. The baba ganoush and beef shwarma were tasty. The french fries were fresh and crisp. I will be back to try more of their menu.</review>

<Review>The Chicken shawarma is delicious. My husband is in love with beef shawarma, it is so flavorful. The best authentic middle eastern restaurant in San Diego. So glad that this place opened up in poway.</Review>< Pics>

I love going to this sprout. Is so easy to find the products and when you can't find them just ask. All the people who work there are amazing, respectfully even when you bother them. The products are of excellent quality for what you pay.< /Review>

This farmer's market is one of the most famous here in our city! All of the sellers were friendly and sweet at this market station. You should not hesitate to talk to them and they have always answered your questions promptly. I like this farmer's demand, because they offered affordable prices and affordable rates as well.<//Review>

Located in a shopping plaza off of Mira Mesa Blvd. An impressive Sprouts with modernized deli and eatery. Spacious and well designed. When employees see the lines are too long, they immediately open another cashier. I would recommend this location.<//review>

Sprouts has many wholesale items  Fruits and wine of all kind are available here. Meat is also available. Fresh fishes and shrimps are good here.

Very limited varieties of flowers are available. Candies and pulses are available in bulk. Frozen foods, Asian and Italian food are arranged well in racks. Freshly baked goodies like breads and muffins make it more interesting.</text>

A lot of organics products can be found at these stores. In my opinion, Sprouts Farmers Market is a little bit better than Whole foods market.</review>

Placed a delivery order via Instacart and this is the kind of produce I received. A rotten, moldy papaya!   I contacted Sprouts, they told me to contact Instacart, Instacart told me to contact Sprout.  No one is taking responsibility, so very disappointing!< /review>

They are limiting the number of ppl in the store at one time ... so you might be in a line. If so, the line moves pretty quickly. DO NOT Bring in your own shopping bags from home at this time. Their inventory remains robust, diverse and high quality. Good energy there in a challenging time.</Review>

I used to love Sprouts (would have given it 4/5 late last year), but lately it's been a waste of time going. For months and months back to fall 2018, neither the water section of their cooler nor the ready-to-eat food section is being maintained. And some of their clerks need training in common courtesy -- though this seems to be a problem at most stores in this area.

While I don't always drink cold bottled water, it's nice to have when the thirst strikes. Except no one is filling the shelves on a regular basis anymore. And today, they also shrunk the space in the cooler, adding more expensive, non-water drinks.

As for the food -- despite working at home, I sometimes need to grab a quick bite, and I usually incorporate that into other errands. Except my favorite, their once-delicious corn dog two-pack is almost never on the shelves anymore. Instead of my weekly (or sometimes twice-weekly) treat, It can be two months before I actually see any on the shelf, unlike last year.

To top off today with crazy, inconsiderate drivers in the parking lot, the clerk that served me couldn't be bothered to say hello, thank you, or goodbye, despite that I was polite and said those things. Like a lot of clerks around here, they ignore me but are polite to people served before and after me. My crime? I wish I knew.

Fortunately, Sprouts at this location still has frequent price drops for fresh fruit, and their packs/ bunches are always in good quality -- unlike other stores in the area with fruit rotting on the bottom of a pack/ bag.<//Review>

Friendly helpful staff, good selection of natural foods. Quiet-ish went the day before Thanksgiving and it wasn't too crazy.

Word of warning generally sprouts produce is very cheap, which is great, but it also tends to go bad faster than produce from other stores. I try to eat everything I buy here in 3-4 days<//Text>

I like how I can buy things in small quantities here but the thing I hate the most about this store is the quality of their products. The aisles often have a large number of expired items. Some items like bread and produce have mold on them even before the expiry date. So a word of advice to anyone who shops here, carefully look at every item before purchase< /review>

My family has been loyal Sprouts shoppers since we moved to the USA 5+ years ago. I really like how they have a lot of unique and eco-friendly brands, so that you can select items that benefit smaller companies. We always come for double ad wednesday and purchase a good, healthy week of family food for a reasonable price :)</Review>

<text>It is a nice and larger than typical Sprouts.   It was totally madness on the Grand Opening Date snd so glad to see a Sprouts in this area.   This store could use a larger parking lot since there are few stores and restaurants in same area.   It seemed they were under estimating the first day crowd, they ran out the free shopping bags.< /text><resp>None<//resp><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x80dbf98b294d1355:0x9edadb30fa66f6f3</gmap_id><rating>4</rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>My favorite store to shop for food. It has fresh and high quality veggies and fruits for good prices compared to vons and other natural grocery stores. It provides a discount on some items each week on the weekly ad. I like to shop for sprouts brand items. They always have a good quality and lower prices. Also the bulk section provides a lot of items for good prices. My favorite items to buy: veggies, fruits, ezzikle bread, dried fruits, dates, tofu, almond milk, spices, condiments, and from bulk section: nuts, seeds, beans, rice, oat.</review>< Pics>

<rate>2<//rate><review>For whatever reason, this particular sprouts sells old produce (check your salad mixes because i bought one that was a day past expiration). Most items just seem more expensive than other sprouts. They also pick which 72 hour sale items to honor, which is annoying when you go to find seafood items like scallops $3-4 more per lb. than advertised. This store needs to up their game and stop riding off the reputation of other sprouts locations.< /review>< Pictures>

This store has tons of products but unfortunately I was constantly being watched at least that's what I felt employees just watching every move you make even to go to the bathroom when I walked out the same guy with a board turned to look at me as I came out. Even the employees seemed a little bit nervous as if maybe their supervisors were just watching them. It's unfortunate because I saw a ton of stuff that I would have loved to have purchased but I just bought some few items some treats for my dog  a coffee and I got the hell out of there but maybe it was my boots and itty bitty shorts and a tank top? Perhaps I'll wear a tie and and a suit next time.<//text>

Immediately was told Nope! Negative Attitude and lack of customer service needs to be addressed with this employee. Felt like I was bothering him.< /Review>< Pics>

Don't come when it's busy, you can't even get in the door. Too many people at the counter and also lollygaggers trying to figure out if they want what's on display. The walk way is too narrow so you're forced to go to what looks like a dead end past their fishy smelling meat department. I'm sorry I wasted time coming here.< /Review>

Amazing, immersive experience! We did The Last Supper and it was the perfect balance of puzzle solving and interacting with the actor. The staff were very friendly and stayed in character. Perfect story and room! Definitely recommend! Thank you also to Nicole!</Text>

My team and I played both games recently and had an absolutely great time! Witch’s Cauldron was very fun for us, which we blew through without a hitch. Last Supper is a whole different experience. Go into this game blind, trust me. It’s a wonderful time playing here and we will absolutely return for their upcoming third game in the future.</text>

<text>My family and I came here for the first time today and did the Last Supper room. We had an absolutely wonderful time. The puzzles were challenging but not too difficult. Our 12 and 13yr olds had the best time helping solve the puzzles and engaging with the actor in the room. Highly recommend visiting.< /text>< pics>

<text>Three of us did the Last Supper, and WOW!  I've done over 40 rooms and this has to rank in my top 5 for sure !  GO.  It will be worth the drive and every penny.  I was both super relieved to escape, and sad it was finished.   I'll get to the fantastic Lord Garrick in a bit, but we'll start with the production.   The set design was perfect for three reasons - it was was very straight forward with almost no excess clutter, you weren't misled by a gaggle of annoying red herrings, and it was perfectly medieval and totally immersive.  I felt like I an unwitting guest in the dining room of a demon-possessed, cannibalistic, medieval lord.

Once you've done as many rooms as I have, it's not often you get in that heart-racing panic to get out, but this room thrilled me, stressed me out, and delighted me in all the best ways possible.  The puzzles weren't frustrating or terribly hard, but the stress factor can make your mind go blank.  We asked for two hints - one in the very beginning which we definitely needed and one towards the end - and escaped with less than 2 minutes, so if you get stuck, don't sit there. Ask for help!  The game master wants you to get out, too!

Lord Garrick, Lord Garrick, Lord Garrick - if it weren't for the pandemic, I would have hugged both the actor and the game master when it was over for making this experience so fantastic.  He was so intimidating, and while his voice was deeply melodious, authoritative and lordly, his persona was subtly menacing and you knew at any moment that he would snap.

This is a room you can go to multiple times because the second time around, they will let you be part of the game while your friends suffer through it.  I absolutely plan on going back!  Well done, Quest Tavern!!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>We had a group of 8 and we played Witch's Cauldron and then Last Supper. Witch's Cauldron was great, love being split up in the beginning and saw some really cool puzzles and props that I haven't seen in many other rooms. Then we played Last Supper which is one of my top 3 favorite rooms of all time and I have played over 100 rooms. The actor really made it for us. He was so incredibly in character, scared us just the perfect amount and improvised based on what we said and did. The puzzles were also awesome and saw some props that I haven't seen in many other rooms just like the Witches Cauldron. This room was really mind-blowing overall and honestly some of the most fun I've had in a while!<//review>< GmapID>

My group had an amazing experience doing the “Last Supper” room. It is a truly unique room that requires us to be more interactive! The room was beautifully decorated and you can tell they went all out theming it. I cannot wait to return to try the other rooms! Would 100% recommend!<//review>

My friends and I are big fans of D&D and escape rooms, so this place was a match made in heaven! I went there for my birthday, and my friends and I all dressed up as fantasy characters to get even more immersed. At the time, only Witch's Cauldron was available. This was my first ever escape room, and it definitely raised the bar really high! The puzzles were definitely difficult, but with some out of the box thinking and help from the friendly staff, we got through! Definitely coming back for Last Supper, and you bet my friends and I are going up dressed as fantasy characters again!</text>

BEST escape room I have done so far and also the first with an interactive actor! We picked The Last Supper and having an actor made everything so much more enjoyable than a room with just random clues. The twist and turns of the story were so amazing and fun! The clues were unique and really played well into the story, Not to mention the owners are just as fun as the actual escape room. I have never been so entertained from beginning to end, YOU HAVE TO GO!!<//review>

<Review>Oh wow, I can't even explain how awesome it was. It was our first escape room and it was one of the best experiences we had together as a family. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The host was awesome, and Lord Gerick, hope I spelled it correct, was great. I definitely recommended this place.</Review><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

<Date>1599962054175<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I did The Last Supper a few weeks ago with my wife and some friends and I must say it is my favorite escape room we have done. While we have not reached the level of some enthusiasts we have done about 10 different rooms and this one we discovered is the most unique. First I will say when making the reservations I messed up and did the wrong room, but I called and they changed it no problem for me. This room is definitely about the experience rather than trying to beat the clock and they doing an amazing job giving you your moneys worth. The actor in ours, Jordan, was phenomenal. He does such a good job of being intense and maintaining suspense in the room but at the same time gives quite the coming relief to the point we were rolling over laughing during the interactions. The puzzles were overall challenging and clever. We enjoyed it so much we came again with my in laws to do their Sabotage mode. We requested Jordan again as our Lord Garrick and got their early to set it up. He and Nicole were really great, they came up with a plan and were really hospitable. I can't recommend it enough, we will be back soon to try the Witches Cauldron</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c32ff293921fa5:0xf846baec7449a04b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If I can give this place 6 stars I would.

Going through my reviews you'll notice that my fiance and I have done over 50 rooms. After going through The Witch's Cauldron and meeting with the owner we knew that we had to do Last Supper as that room was making waves in the ER community.

Witch's Cauldron is a very scrappy room with a strong atmosphere and great lighting. There are things that will stick out such as a digital clock and modern combination locks that clash with the old-time fantasy setting but we found them more charming than deal breakers. We had time to nerd out with the owner who is really chill. It was Witch's Cauldron charm and the owner's infectious enthusiasm that motivated my fiancee to not only book Last Supper but to book it as our 50 room milestone.

As for Last Supper, boy oh boy talk about improvement!

If Witch's Cauldron was the fun scrappy room then Last Super is the super-polished final output. That room was an utter BLAST to play filled with tension, fun puzzles and horror-comedy. This goes without saying that our actor was amazing with his strong performance anchoring the experience and really elevating the feeling of urgency. Also worth pointing out the adaptive soundtrack which stayed at a lull during slower moments only to ratchet up when stuff hit the fa really giving the room a full story arch. Get some friends and get over here to play BOTH their games.< /Text>

Oh my goodness! My friends and I just did the Witch's Cauldron. It was so much fun! The puzzles were well thought out.  They were challenging, yet logical.  The room was just the right amount of creepy/eerie.  Our game host was very friendly and sweet. I'd definitely recommend Quest Tavern to anyone looking to do an Escape Room.</Review>

Played the Last Supper tonight with a group of friends. We did not know this escape room has live actors and it was our first escape room we went to that has them. From start to finish, this experience was top notch and we all left feeling like this is one of our best escape room experiences yet.

The puzzles were very well thought out with some we never saw before. Without giving much away there are a few surprises that will be talked about after the room. The actors were really into their roles and played them masterfully. They added urgency, surprises, humor and memorable moments. Overall this is a must go to escape room for those who want to see the next level in escape rooms. We will definitely be back if there are more quests added in future - they are just getting better.< /Text>

Very fun and definitely challenging escape room. Our game master was very helpful and nice. She dressed in theme which was pretty cool to see.
It was a great experience, from when we entered to when we exited.
We had a team of four and was able to escape with 2 minutes left.
If you escape and save the village, the game master offers you beer (root-beer) or ale (ginger ale).
I can't get into too many details as it would spoil the experience but it was one of my favorite escape rooms and I would recommend this location. Awesome family bonding activity or date night event.</review>

My favorite type of escape rooms involve having your group split up then figuring out how to come back together to escape. My friend and I (team of 2) were able to complete Witch's Cauldron with 22 minutes left.

The room was exhilarating and had some pretty interesting puzzles. This was definitely an intermediate level room, so beware for those who are new to escape rooms.

The storyteller host was great! Kept in character the whole time. The decoration was done really well. No spoilers so yeah.

Definitely looking forward to trying other rooms from Quest Tavern!<//review>

<review>The best escape room I’ve been to so far! Was there Sunday for their new room Last Supper! It takes the escape room to the next level with live actors who are so into their roles which made me feel like I was really part of the story. Highly recommend it!<//review><response>{'time': 1574795274609, 'text': "Hi Flora, Thank you for completing the Last Supper quest with us! We're glad that you had a great time.

My team recently completed "The Witch's Cauldron" at Quest Tavern.

With no hints, I would describe the difficulty of this room as firmly 'intermediate.' However this room has the impressive distinction of being very well put together AND having wonderful game masters.
That means that players of all skill levels will enjoy the experience equally, as the game masters - if needed - seem to know exactly how to nudge you in the right direction without giving too much away.

All that combines with clever puzzles, strong aesthetic design, and a seamless flow to give an experience that is well worth the time and money.

I recommend this room for everyone, and I will be back to try more of Quest Tavern's rooms as soon as they are available.<//Text>

LOVE this place! It’s my 3rd escape room and it has become my favorite now. Super friendly staffs and unique waiting area. The puzzles were challenging because you really need to think outside of the box. Its pretty different than other rooms I have experienced. A must do!<//Review>

Hello there fellow escapists!! Were from TX and tonight was our very first escape room and thankfully our cousins were veterans at the game so we just went on a ride of puzzling situations. We’ll surely come back to play more games, i hope i can be of more of use next time! Thank you to our host (she was cute and funny too) for understanding our 50 shades of grey references.</Text>

The Last Supper was the first escape room I had been in with a live actor/actress involved; the interactive sequence was quite amusing! The script, the atmosphere, and the puzzles were all well thought out and well designed. Will definitely be back for other rooms!< /Text>

Wow! Did the witches Cauldrin and it was great. You start off blindfolded and end up in a separate room. So much fun and in the end if you win you get an ale or beer, alcohol free of course.<//Text>

<Review>They have my new favorite game! It's been about 6 months since I last played a room. But I've done about 40 now in total. Both games were wonderful. Some seriously genius puzzles that fit the theme and made sense to be there, especially in the witch game. Their other game, The Last Supper, was the amazing! I'd consider it a a thriller/horror game. But the unexpected and best part to me was that I have never laughed so much while playing an escape room. Or maybe in the last few months of my life lol. They set up moments to make us laugh, or for us to make ourselves laugh. The actor was great, the story flowed perfectly. As well as continuously throughout, constantly developing to immerse us further and further. Timing of the puzzles allowed us to finish with only a few minutes to spare. My biggest wish is I want to get amnesia so I can just forget it and play it over and over haha. Thanks for the great evening!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I had the pleasure of playing both of their AH-MAZING rooms last night.
First off, their lobby/entrance area is spacious, welcoming and beautifully themed. It really sets the theme for the rooms you’re about to experience. From their sign in, to little mini games while you wait, it’s all in the details. They even have a “Quest board” like in role playing games/adventures is where you would go to accept quests.
Now let’s talk about their rooms:
- The Witches Cauldron: this is the less scary of the two so if you aren’t a fan of scary or scare actors, I would recommend this room. The immersement begins before you even enter the room. From the get-go with the story, you are continuously immersed in the room and the story. The puzzles match the theme really well. There’s a nice level of difficulty to challenge those who like to be challenged. For those who need a little nudge, there’s a way to ask for guidance if needed.
I thoroughly enjoyed this room for its puzzles, theme, immersement and layout.
- The Last Supper: this is the scarier of the two and includes a live scare actor. So if you aren’t up for this, maybe stick with the Witches Cauldron. Otherwise, I highly recommend The Last Supper.
The beautiful thing about this is that you have to interact with the live scare actor. I’ve never had that before so it made for a new kind of experience and I loved it. It really makes you think on your feet, adds the element of fear and nervousness and really adds to the overall challenge. The rooms puzzles  were again nicely themed, a good amount of difficulty and included a variety so they didn’t seem repetitive. The live scare actor was absolutely brilliant! I couldn’t recommend him enough and apparently he’s the “scariest” of them so I’m glad we got the full experience for our game.
The team at Quest Tavern are all wonderful people. Very friendly, they enjoy a good laugh, super accommodating and they play their roles extremely well. Definitely the best Escape Room I’ve done so far in my Escape Room adventures.
Do it - you won’t regret it :)< /review>

Best escape room! Hands down, i've been to several escape rooms but this one is to best i've done. from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave this place is very immersive, with the game master very immersive to the theme, the room is challenging and above all very enjoyable!
The room design is great, the puzzle is not easy, but that's what i'm looking for, I'd recommend this place for all ages and regardless of whether you've done one before or not you will not be disappointed! Definitely going back if they have more room!</Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>The plunge swimming pool used to be a place to take your children to escape the Heat of the Summer sun and enjoy swimming but, I find it particularly hard to bring my young son to a pool where the female lifeguards have their swimsuit bottoms wedged up their hind ends... let's face it ladies, it is not attractive, especially if your bottom is flat, and by the way, dimples are cute on the cheeks of your face, not on your rear end, especially when your rear end looks hungry 🤢... most people when they pick a wedgie out of their butt it is to pull it out, not to pull it up further in... unfortunately for me I had I to witness this several times... Disgusting!!!  🤢😨😳😰😷
Please!  for the love of God and for all that is decent, please wear swim short and cover your business... Thank you.<//Text><response>None< /response>< userid>

This place was living heck
My daughter came back crying with bruises and scratch marks all over her body what is this place she hated her first day
She told me she was forced to go under the water and one of the instructors sank her to the bottom of the deep end and she tried to break free but she was very abused tortured and frightened I will never ever allow my daughter to come here ever again I hope you guys shut down this was the worst service ever I’ve seen drunk people better behaved than any worker in that facility very disappointed!!!😡</Text>

<user_name>Ember McLain<//user_name><review>This place is terrible, the lifeguards are lazy and do not watch over children well. They do not look out for the safety of children, I also heard them use profanity. They are also very rude and disrespectful, especially the females. I witnessed female lifeguards point and laugh at a plus size woman. This is NOT at all acceptable. The lifeguards also have there swimsuits wedged up there butts. You can literally see EVERYTHING. This is a public pool for kids NOT a strip club. Show some decency at least if you are a 'lifeguard" who is suppose to be making sure kids don't drown.< /review><Date>1562483224753</Date></record>

A big swimming pool for kids and adults. The slide needs to be more trilling. Life guards think they know it all. They need more training on being watchful for the kids around the deep parts of the pool and seeing if they can swim.<//review>

Good place to take your kids, but the life guards dont look or act like they like their job. They can be very rude to the little kids trying to talk to them.< /text>

<review>I have been shopping here for a few years now and this place is the absolute best for all things plumbing, irrigation, water wells and septic systems, including the electrical components. I use lots of this stuff on my 1.5 acres so I love the place.

It really is a great store with friendly knowledgeable people and pro quality materials, and they always seem to have what I need. Its amazing. Do yourself a favor, check this place out.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa_Xvvnbxr0DxAHtO-mgyQ6MsxB8N2y0ojg8EG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

There is nothing better than Real customer service. Only place in town, that knew what I was working on just by seeing a portion of a part, knew about the product and what they have and can offer, and had me out the door in record time with the small evasive piece I needed. It's easy to know where I shop for all my plumbing supply now.< /Review>

< Review>
I should have posted this a long time ago but here it goes. I will never step foot in this business again. My experience was some years ago but it always has stuck with me. My new husband and I married in 2018 and I told him to never go to them. My experience was horrible. I went in to buy a fitting for a hose like a washer and the young girl and man sneered at me since I first walked in. They were clearly mean and angry individuals. My gut instinct was that that were extremely racist and didn’t want me in there at all. My father lived in auburn over 30 years and I visited frequently through the years and I have never run into such blatant disrespect and racism. Their hate was seething. And for no other reason than that I was not white. I couldn’t believe it myself but it is true ! I will never step foot in there ever again. I never expected to ever experience such racism so blatant there was no other reason why they should have treated me that way. Beware if your tan or olive skinned whether you black Hispanic or Puerto Rican do not I REPEAT do not go in there business unless you intend to be treated like garbage. This experience has stuck with me through the years and I can only imagine the racism that had been instilled in them through their parents. Now if I ever experienced that with any business I’ll definitely speak up next time. Horrible people. Just a hateful young girl and guy who I don’t even know if they work their anymore. But my experience was bad enough to finally post these years later and to never patronize their store ever. In the past I would go to ace hardware in grass valley. Worth the trip and they are nice people not like the young girl and guy at this store !!!!!!!! They should be ashamed of themselves. Karma will be their worst nightmare.</Review>

Lots & lots of parts. Also pellet stoves. And pellets. Swamp coolers in season. Vast supply if irrigation supplies and parts. Did I mention plumbing.? Staff helpful if you don't ask dumb questions. Can be busy at times. This is a statement about their popularity.</review>< Pics>

Good selection of PVC parts and pipe. Better then most hardware stores or big box stores in the area. I went there to find some parts that I could not find in other stores. Should have just went there first. I saw copper fittings and a lot of other stuff like wood pellets and valves of different types. I really did not go through the whole store, so this review can be added too.</text>

Always the go-to place for parts and expert help with anything plumbing, irrigation, sewer, electrical or HVAC. Sure, the big box stores have loads of basic parts for the straight-forward home repair but nowhere near the expertise of the gang at Anderson's nor the extensive inventory. Jerry has helped me design complicated water systems and Marc is the guy for sprinkler, drip and any kind of help with irrigation systems. The crew always takes the time to answer any question no matter how basic or detailed. Whether you're a weekend DYIer or a trades professional, this is THE place to go.</Text>

< Review>
Bought a jet pump for $560. Primed the pump and it started to leak water from the case before it was ever used. Disconnected took it to the service dept the guy hooks it up claims it isn't leaking while it's running. I told him to turn it off and itll leak. He argued about it for couple minutes then shut it off and it started to clearly leak again. Not a huge leak but dripping but for being brand new it's not acceptable. He continued to be hostile but folded to reasoning because he knew I was right. I returned to the store and was able to attain a full refund thanks to the good help of someone working there. Overall if this company had more competition it wouldn't be around.</Review>

Do not recommend these people for any well service you may need. Dishonest. Say what needs to be said in the store in order to make extra $$$$ at your ranch. Scammers!!< /review>< Pics>

He brought his pump control box into us to be tested, and it tested out to be O.K. therefore leading us to believe the problem was elsewhere.  Although we cannot duplicate all the conditions that are in the field in our shop we feel that our testing to be very accurate and free of charge. At this time the customer requested that our “On-Call Technician” call him to set up a service call at his residence which is approximately 30 minutes from our facility.\nOur tech responded to the service call, surveyed the job and installed a new control box that he had on his truck instead of pulling the pump out of the well, which would have been more costly. He also noticed that the pressure switch was showing some wear replaced it at this time also. All of this was done and only charged customer for 1 hour and 15 minutes at $140.00 per hour plus parts that was agreed upon before he hired our tech to come out to the job.\nTotal billing for job\n$100.57 – materials\n$7.54 – Ca. Sales Tax\n$175.00 – labor 1.25 hrs at $140.00 (Saturday overtime rate)\n$283.11 – total to have water again\nScam??? I don’t think so\nSorry for the excellent customer service\nAnderson’s Sierra Pipe Co.'}<//response>

<Text>I don't mean to leave a negative review, the attendant is nice... but this last time the ice cream packaging stank like the fridge. There's mold or something. The choice of ice cream was slim, mostly ultra cheap brands. An unfriendly sign on the pump has greeted customers from the moment this station was open. "Due to too many drive offs, please stay with your car and nozzle while you are pumping." I.e. you are not allowed or trusted to walk inside while your car is fueling. I really don't need this attitude when every station has had this problem and didn't need to nag their good customers.<//Text></record>

Gas was affordable for the area and they accept credit cards. I do not recall a surcharge for using credit. Only issue I had: no restroom for customers.</Review>

Love the cheap prices, it's new, very well lit, very clean & spacious, personable staff. $3.45 a gallon where most today are $3.75+, and conveniently right as you come in from the 110fwy, onto Gaffey St.

Great addition to the neighborhood, I wish them luck! I found this sign very funny!!!!<//text>

Generally the best prices in town. The car seems to still be operable, so the affordable prices may not indicate inferior fuel. They also have diesel, which is handy if that is a type of fuel you're looking for.

Chances are, the next time my usual gas station is too crowded, I'll mist likely buy fuel here again.<//review>

<review>Unbelievably RUDE & Stuck up counter help! He would not even look me in the eyes. Horrible customer service, he should not be behind the counter, his attitude could wind up costing him a jab to the jaw. Maybe consider investing in a glass booth if you keep him employed. Will not be going back there or recommending this place. Just being honest.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Very clean and fuel is very low. The workers there are also very helpful. I could not get the pump to work. The young lady came out. She coordinated with the young man inside to reset the pump. She put the nozzle in and said there you go ma'am. Real genuine customer service. Which these days is a lost and often rarely seen skill.< /Review>

<review>I pumped gas yesterday and my card was charged $50,$50, and $40.01 for a $40.01 gas purchase. I called the gas station to ask about it and the girl on the phone was 100% rude about it. I understand I needed to talk to my bank on a regular buisness day but it was the way she spoke to me. She needs customer service training!< /review>< Resp>

Was just there. Had a verbal exchange with the staffer, a baseball-capped, moss-fringed punk with a mouth on him. Used the f-word at me and then reminded me that *I* was on tape. LOL. Nice owner and his wife. Nice other staff there always, but this fellow is a lemon. I'll not go here again while he remains in your employ. END OF LINE< /Text>

Super new (to me!) and appearing high-Tech,  but how technical can a gas station be? The owners/operators were very friendly and helpful with a minor issue we were having,  not a fault of the station.  It's a nice change to the once almost frightening scene that was a person's first impression of San Pedro coming off the 110 South.</Text>

Your average gas station but this one is new, and clean.  It also is one of the lower prices for gas in the area which is a big plus in my book.  But the biggest plus was the  accidentally left my cell phone there.  I called them and they actually went out and looked for it, found it, and then held it for me till I could go back there and retrieve it.  Things like that don't happen much these days anymore.<//Text>

The pumps have long hoses so it doesn't matter which side you come in on. And diesel at every pump. Good pricing, convenient location.< /text>

I have found this product to meet my needs for document signing. With the changes of working from home and less personal contact over the past year and half it has been nice to have this product. The clients state it is easier to understand and use than other document signing programs.< /Review>

<review>I have had an excellent experience with setting up and using eSign Genie for the small insurance agency I work for. I had a dedicated representative walk me through how to use the site, and he worked with my schedule since I had to break it into multiple days due to a busy couple of weeks at that time. He was patient and answered all of my questions. I have not had any issues with the Genie going through "Maintenance" during working hours or any outages that lasted more than a split second - can't say that about any other software or applications we use daily. It is simple to use, and has many great features including adding your company logo to your documents. It was a small learning curve with my team, and I have had no complaints about it at all!</review></record>

As a Licensed Professional Counselor working independently, I found what I needed in HIPPA compliant Document e-signing with eSign Genie.  I can import my own documents and templates to send to my clients.  They can sign from their phones or other devices.  Works as expected and the price was within my budget with all the features I needed.</text>

I just recently signed up with eSign Genie to provide their services with my logistics and transportation business. The platform is user friendly and cost efficient. For a small business owner who tries to keep costs down but also provide a quality service to clients, this made things so much easier for me to manage. The customer service is incredible, Danny who is my rep has went above and beyond to help this old school thinker move into the 21st century.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>First and foremost, the platform is incredibly user friendly! The home screen makes navigation easy and I can keep it as surface level or in depth as I like. As the main admin I am able to make adjustments to all the settings and assign users to different levels of abilities. I love the auto-reminders and status updates.

Additionally, I love that I can see the progress of a document. After it is sent, I can open the pending document and see if the signer has viewed it. I can also see how much of the document has been completed, which allows for easy tracking and time management.

My absolute favorite thing is how quickly the team works to get everything running smoothly. I've only had 2-3 times where the system was down or there was an issue and within 5 minutes it is always up and running again.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

We've been using eSign Genie, often daily, for a few months now, after changing from another comparably-priced software that we used for a year.  eSign Genie has proven more straight-forward for both ourselves and our signers.  We send agreements to guests who need to sign, input information, and return quickly.  The learning curve is easy, setting up our templates and email messages is easy, and it is easy to line up the text boxes so that they look perfect in the documents (that was one of our frustrations with the other software.) We have contacted the company once with a technical issue that they resolved and haven't had to contact them since.  We compare that to all the times we contacted the previous software support team for help (and they were great to work with) further supporting our recommendation that this software is truly user friendly.<//text>

<review>This is truly an awesome and affordable product for proposal e-signatures

The software makes it super easy to connect your existing documents and send them to customers for e-signatures. I've used other platforms that were 10x the cost and this performs just as well.

With my usage of the platform, I really haven't found any cons. My needs are relatively simple - easily track and send proposals to customers for signatures. Loving this so far.</review></record>

My law firm has used eSign Genie for about three years and we couldn't be happier with them! The platform is easy to use for both my firm and clients, the price is very affordable for all of the great features that you get, and the support staff are incredibly helpful and responsive if you need help. I tried out many other e-signature platforms, and none were as robust and affordable as eSign Genie. Without a doubt, eSign Genie is the best and we look forward to continuing to work with them for years to come!</Text>

eSign Genie is great!  I switched from DocuSign because these guys are cheaper, easier to use, and actually offer LIVE human support. They walked me through the process of getting my contracts setup, and they run now like they are on autopilot.  I highly recommend checking out eSign Genie!<//Text>

< Review>
I am in the insurance industry and I was using one of the other programs for our electronic signatures. When the bill came for my renewal and was 6 times the amount to continue using the service it prompted me to research other companies with the same abilities. I stumbled upon eSign Genie and gave them a call.
I tried a demo and realized it was perfect for my needs and turned out to be less than I paid for the first service.
I have been very happy with eSign Genie and they are really priced right for business use.
I would highly recommend checking them out for yourself.< /Review>

<UserId.>108750805689817710572</UserId.><text>I've been using eSign Genie for a little over a year now and I have nothing but good words for this service.

I'm in the rental real estate business and needed an e-signature platform that integrated well with our Google drive based documents. I also wasn't willing to pay the outrageous prices some other services were charging. When I found eSign Genie, I was surprised to see that it checked off all the boxes for us.

And to top it off, the 2 times I needed support, I was quickly taken care of by their excellent customer service team. A quick chat was the only thing needed to get me set up.

Highly recommended!<//text>< rate>

I have nothing but fantastic things to say about eSign Genie. As most people who have priced out or use electronic signature software know, the major players in this field can charge exorbitant corporate/enterprise pricing.

Esign Genie is not only affordable but their Product Service/Account Management team is fantastic. Chris was very easy to work with, very knowledgeable about the product, helped us set up, and get going quickly. The software itself is much more user intuitive than others I have used and we were able to get documents out to our clients less than a week after purchasing.

Overall great product with wonderful customer service.<//review>

I am a solo bankruptcy attorney who needs clients to be able to easily review and sign documents that I file with the court and use with other attorneys.  eSign Genie has made it very simple for me to create signable documents for my clients that they can access through an email or text message link.  The web site is easy to use and it only takes me a few minutes to create the documents.  This has been a lifesaver for my firm during the pandemic as in-person meetings have been restricted.</Review>

<text>eSign Genie is very easy to set up and use. They have a very knowledgeable staff who are friendly and ready to help. The software allows you to set rules to delete incomplete forms automatically and much more. I had some trouble getting started, but the great guys at eSign Genie helped me figure out what I was doing wrong. We needed a way to digitize membership forms and they have become a simple solution to a big problem. eSign Genie is by far the easiest to set up and the most cost-effective product on the market. Thanks, guys.<//text>< pictures>

We have used eSign genie for a number of years, but since Covid began it's literally used daily. It's simple to use, the site is easy to navigate, and customers don't have issues using it.  If I had ever had any issues I was able to chat and issues were resolved instantly. I would highly recommend for any type of business.<//review>

I use eSign Genie for rental leases on a small multi-family property. The thing that originally brought me to them was the "Pay As You Go" feature.  It's much more affordable for me since I only need 20 documents a year.

At first I found eSign Genie to be a bit more confusing than what I was used to with a different and much more expensive doc esign company. Now, I can navigate their system like a breeze. My tenants are able to execute the documents quick and easily so I have no complaints.

I definitely recommend eSign Genie for a small non-profit organization like mine looking for something affordable and easy to use.<//review>

eSign Genie has been fundamental in aiding our organization to stay in compliance with various government agencies, especially now during the Covid-19 issue affecting all of us. We have several people working from home and they have employees that they manage, out in the field. It has been a challenge to disseminate documents for signature and tracking to make sure they are returned on a timely basis – following up with snail mail originals. eSign Genie has absolutely changed the way we function and do business since this is all now done virtually and has relieved a lot of stress on managers and the organization’s home office employees.< /review>

<review>The document creation interface was smooth for both individual documents and bulk templated documents. The bulk documents I needed signed (by hundreds of different signers) was exceptionally simple to accomplish. The resulting signed documents were praised by the Legal Dept. Also, the delivery of the signed documents was smooth.

I tested 3 document signing services for a project that entailed resolving debts with 361 subcontractors stemming from a customer bankruptcy. I need to deliver a notification email and the Debt Resolution Agreement to each subcontractor, Some were for negotiated amounts and some were for standard % amounts, eSignGenie.com allowed me to do both functions with similar preparation. The resulting signed documents simply appeared in my inbox in a format I could forward to accounting with little or no other work needed<//review>< Pictures>

I was looking for an esign program that I could just use as needed. Many other's were monthly subscriptions, etc. I use this to esign service agreements with new customers. We only need it every so often, so this was a good fit for us. And comparatively I find it inexpensive and easy to use.<//text>

This software has all the features that were important to me. Like conditional fields, multiple signers and when updating a form or application you don't have to start over again. The software is VERY flexible.

Creating a document that is easy for a client to understand and complete is a game changer. We are already experiencing a higher document completion rate than when we were with either DocuSign or Adobe (echosign)

eSign Genie has been a total solution for all my e-signing needs. Since I'm in the financial industry many of my documents need to be signed. Allowing our clients to sign online without printing , scanning, faxing or emailing anything is a game changer. There are many options out there for eSigning and I've used several. However, eSign genie has the best software, the best customer support I've ever seen (Lisa is who helps me most of the time and she is AMAZING) and all at a price that is a fraction of the competition</review>

<Text>Great tool for businesses looking to integrate documents into automated workflows. The integration capabilities make it very easy to use. Only downside is that when embedding a document on a webpage, it's difficult for users to navigate and sign from their mobile devices.<//Text>< pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I decided to sell my own home as it was to hard to swallow giving away over 20k the last time I did. So I needed a solution to esign as there are a bunch of documents you have to deal with during the sale of a home. It worked great and the cost was very reasonable. The UI was simple to learn and understand, even intuitive. And when you run out, you get a message and purchase 5 more. I would use this even if I needed a subscription. Excellent product. I work in software and usability, cost and intuitive UI is the gold standard. I think eSign Genie has set the bar high.<//review><username>Brian Christian</username><Time>1611971083478</Time></record></dataset><record>

I'm very satisfied with eSign Genie. I am CEO of a small research nonprofit. Our studies require that we use CFR 21 part 11 compliant document signature and storage software. eSign Genie's template designer and programmability combined with their level of support and professionalism set them apart from more established brands such as DocuSign and Adobe Sign which require larger subscription purchases which exceeded our project budget.</Review>

<Text>I found most esign programs offer the same features and I did not find any of them hard to use . The real selling point for us with Esign Genie is there SMS signing feature and customer service We have many clients who do not check their email regularly ,forget their passwords or just do not have email at all . Esign SMS capabilities stopped our need and lowered our expense of mailing out contracts . Our client sign rate do to this SMS feature is about 97% .< /Text>< Pics>

I chose eSign Genie for the API features. For a one-man shop looking to automate steps to save time, this company was hands down the winner for me. eSign Genie support has always been spot on and helped me set up API integration with Lodgify & Zapier. Now my customers receive contractual tailored documents within seconds of completing an online transaction with another SaaS product. Even aer the documents are signed other SaaS products are updated and other workflows initiated.  eSign Genie is essential to my operation.< /text>

< Review>
I've tried similar electronic signature platforms before, i.e. Docu***n. And for  my purposes, I have found that eSign Genie fulfills my needs and has features that I wanted, but did not find with Docu. Best of all, eSign Genie is a fraction of the cost of Docu. Frankly, the price of eSign Genie led me to try their platform, but the performance of that platform has created a loyal customer! If you are considering switching platforms, you should definately give eSign Genie a try.<//Review>

<text>Our company has multiple locations around the state of Washington.  We are a non-profit that operates on grants so we need to provide signatures on many of our reimbursable documents like time sheets, expense reports, contracts, etc.  We used to have to scan and send documents for signature and then email back which was time consuming and inefficient. With eSign Genie, we have cut the time in half it used to take if not more.< /text><user_name>Rhonda Starling</user_name><userid>105107301926557249080</userid>< rating>

This is probably the best camping in the Inyo National forest.
Thanks to Phill, the Camp Host and Mike the Ranger that opened the Campground early so we could stay there. This is a free Campground ⛺️
Please keep it clean and litter free.< /review>

Easy, self-service campsite. We were located at the very end where it said campground limits, and were unable to find the restrooms (maybe because of out location). Other than that, large campsites, easy access to mono lake and mammoth. Fun stay :)<//review>

Loved this campground; it is free, plenty of space in between campgrounds, there is creek that runs through the campground and there is a fire pit in each site. There is vault toilets and OHV trails, it is a short and scenic drive from Mammoth and Lee Vining.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>This is one of my favorite campgrounds in California. It's free. Rarely crowded. Has pit toilets. Picnic tables. And bear bins for food storage  (must use them in California as cars don't count as proper storage like they do elsewhere). My only complaint is that rarely it will fill up with RVs due to some nearby event and their loud generators take away from the quietness of this normally peaceful campground.< /text><userid>114193753540843194153<//userid><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

Mostly frequented by ATVers. If that is your thing - good enough. If not - there are no nicer campgrounds in the area<//Review>

<Text>Always has been a great place to camp in the past.
The camp host is don't the best on off road noise he let the loud bike run in the camp.
Everything else is great.<//Text>< username>

Was very peaceful and enjoyed raising my children  under this enviroment . It has changed so much with all the off road runner s you don't see much of the wild life like before, not sure if it's because of all the noise now. Probly have to find a new gem out their somewhere. Sorry to see another beautiful place destroy by are technology and for those who don't appreciate pure nature.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Because this campground is free and relatively close to the highway, it draws a certain crowd.  If you are looking for peaceful surroundings within nature, look elsewhere.< /review>

The new salesman was wonderful to work with. Gave honest opinions, complemented on our good Tate. Showed jewelry with expertise. Very efficient..  His co worker was not so helpful, might have been the manager on duty.  The new I'd definitely a keeper with management potential. We will come to shop when he is working. It was a complete pleasurable shopping experience.

<Review>Excellent Service! The store has really turned around from the way it used to be. Everything is more organized and store is cleaner and feels more welcoming. New manager is doing a great job! There's more clothes out and they are organized in a way that makes it easier to find what you're looking for. Great prices, will be shopping here again.</Review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Love this place. Awesome people who don't discriminate.  Also, they don't hover over you when you are donating... Like Goodwill when donating furniture etc.</Text>

Excellent costumer service.  The manager was very helpful, polite and pleasant. ( very impressed) The store is very organized and clean. I have been to many thrift stores and find that their  prices are more like department stores and find them to be unorganized.   Here at Hope of the Valley the prices are very reasonable and alot of the merchandise are new... I will definitely be shopping here again. I really enjoyed my experience at this store and will definitely  be donating my items here as well.< /text>

Cool place. Probably one of the most organized clothing selection seen at any thrift store. They organize everything by size, color, and type or clothing which makes for a rather pleasant shopping experience unlike many thrift stores.<//review>

Best price.. Have gone to numerous thrift shops in the valley and this shop has the best prices.  Back staff are not too helpful or friendly... Need dressing rooms.. not 1 bathroom as a dressing room.. tacky.  Front staff-cashiers are great.< /Review>

A great thrift store that has great service, and great shoes. All is affordable, and I tend to find more stuff here than goodwill :)

The 4 stars is because there is only one dressing room, and there are days that there are a lot of loud kids (it is out of the store's control obviously, but having kids throwing balls around while I'm shopping takes away from the experience for me).<//text>

Pretty well organized thrift store as far as clothing is concerned (throughout the middle of the store).  A lot of categories around the edges, but plenty of stuffed in nooks & crannies that make hunting around "a must" if you're looking for that unusual "find".  Proceeds all for a good cause - to help provide human-need services through Hope of the Valley to people in who may be mist in need of a helping hand.</Text>

Workers greeted everyone that entered and although they're rarely at the counter they are quick to help you out after ringing the bell.

Apathetic, uncaring management. We drove nearly an hour in LA traffic to donate goods. Website clearly states donations are taken until 7pm.

We arrived shortly after 5:30pm and were told "sorry, we stop taking donations at 5:30pm." We advised them their website says otherwise. They did not care one iota. Store manager? She left for the day.

More criminals living off the backs of the homeless. Avoid, stay away, do not donate. It is not appreciated.<//text>

Second bad experience here! After cashier with long, long lines refuses to call for more help and laughs when his register computer goes down.
Then when I get to the front of the line, he puts a 45 cent surcharge on my debit card without telling me. Very sneaky and probably not legal.
Stick with the Salvation Army better deals and they don't try to scam you at the cash register.<//text>

They were able to put new transmission fluid in my car and even tidy it up for me in less than an hour. Their service manager is a great man dealing with customers and always answering our questions. They all did a great job.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>From a fellow sales person I came here looking just to drool on the hondas Brigham Sears came out to just talk about the weather. No pressure was like he was shopping with me which is nice from the normal sales person. I told him my dreams of leasing someday but I know it's not possible with my low score. Not only did I leave with a lease but he drove to san fran to get my cosigners signature. He got me the top of the line car with a longer lease which is everything I wanted. This experience was shocking and exceptional. I work at a local dealership and I would honestly hands down tell everyone to come to honda and ask for BRIGHAM ******* I LOVE YUBA CITY HONDA!<//Review>< pictures>

Yuba City Honda was my 4th stop in the process of car shopping. Mike greeted us and listened to what we were looking for. He was honest and knowledgeable without coming across as "salesy". He told us the pros and cons of what we were looking for and helped make a decision that was right for us. I would definitely buy from him again!< /review>

This was a really good experience.  Evan was our salesman and he was just fantastic.  Buying a car is such a long process and Evan made it as painless as possible.  He was friendly, informative, honest and helpful.  I would buy another car from Yuba City Honda.<//Review>

Yuba city Honda
1.Didn't provide car wash, (it’s included in the website)anytime i go for service they don’t have guy to wash the car or too much wait that’s the answer i get it every time.
2. I booked my appointment on 8:30 am but when i come they just says first come first serve, so why you guys send email to book an appointment for car service?
Really disgusting service
3. Also the guy says you get your car with in 4 hrs.-really? I booked the appointment.
Attitude of the guy was not good.

Waste of lot of time and money.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

My husband and I have nothing but good things to say about working with Honda. Evan Pomales helped us find a 2020 Honda CRV EX. He was very accommodating to our schedule and answered ALL of our questions. We never felt pressured nor did we feel like we were an inconvenience when we needed more time to make our final decision. We're so grateful for the patience of Evan and the finance team for making this experience so pleasant. Thank you again for all your help!</Review>

Had the BEST experience with YC Honda. My beloved VW Jetta TDI broke down on a Friday night, and we decided it was time for a new car. I hate buying cars, I always feel like someone is trying to screw me! Haha.

Saturday morning we headed over to Honda, Ric and Jordan we’re seriously the best. So nice and helpful. We test drove the 2020 Honda CR-V EXL. We let them know we were test driving a few different cars today and there was absolutely no pressure from them at all. They were so kind and relaxed, not the typical pressure for a car salesman you get.

We left, went and test drove a few others and knew that we wanted the Honda. We called ahead to make sure they had a specific color/interior option I wanted. Jordan pulled it off the lot for us so it was waiting for us. We took it for another test drive just to be sure, Jordan helped us with all of the gadgets and also set up some presets for us as well.

The finance guy was awesome too (I think his name was Dan, not sure though). I simply told them I wouldn’t be able to buy the car if my payment was not under a certain amount and they were able to get it done.

I highly highly recommend YC Honda. They have the best customer service and obviously reliable cars. Thank you, for the best experience I could of asked for!<//Review>

<Text>I have been coming to Honda Service since 2004 when I bought my first Honda Odessey. I love how they have neverminded doing an all point inspection before I do a trip to LA which I do once a month.

One of the best experiences I've ever had purchasing a vehicle from a dealer. There was no funny business which I really appreciated. Emailed Mr Sears asking about the truck told him what I was looking to pay for the vehicle. He went and ran the offer strait in no waiting got back to me within minutes. (not hours like them shady guys elsewhere). Said we have a deal went in then next morning expecting hidden fees or a tire charge. Nope they are true to there word and actually saved me another couple grand said lets go for a drive. Got back made the deal wouldn't have asked for a better purchase or sales man. The Honda dealer itself was well kept and I liked that you could tell they cared more about the customers then how much there going to make. Making sure they found there clients what they truly needed not just selling all the bells and whistles. I will be sending all my friends family and further business to them for sure.</Text>

I drop my suv off to get an oil change and when I go to pick up the advisor informs me they chipped my paint with the power washer but not to worry they will fix it but to come back on Monday and speak to the service manager. I come back to speak to him and the manager hits me with this is a bad paint job therefore we aren’t responsible excuse me? I brought  it here with NO damage and it in your teams care it was damaged please don’t do business here!!! Shady and bad business</Text>

7/17/2020
These are my recollections and impressions of purchasing a used vehicle from YC Honda.

I signed papers gir a vehicle, a 2011 GMC Terrain, on the 12th, and agreed I would pick it up four days later.

I was asked to email my salesman proof of income. I did on the 13th. On the 14th, Dennis in finance said I had to bring in proof of income because he didn't have them. Obviously my salesman never forwarded the documents to the finance staff. Then after I emailed them to Dennis, he says I have to come in and re-sign a document because another finance staffer had previously erred on one document. Finally,  Thursday arrives.

The salesman picks me up st home, and we get to the dealership. Had to wait because the SUV was dirty. Apparently, the dealership had an issue with its detail staff. Mind you there's a car wash almost across the street and the dealership had three days to get the vehicle clean. The salesman hosed off the exterior with what he called soft water so, he explained,  it wouldn't leave spots. It left spots in spite of that. The salesman did not clean the inside of the windshield which was filthy.

The salesman and I had agreed that he would connect the Blue Tooth to my phone. He was unable to do it, explaining that I had to have On-Star to have Blue Tooth. Subsequently I learned from a GMC dealer that the vehicle doesn't have Blue Tooth, and that, even if it did,  that I would not need On-Star. You would think that people would do some research on vehicles they sell, but they don't at YC Honda.

Anyway, the salesman said he would call me later that afternoon about getting the Blue Tooth connected.  Never heard from him since.

Before he left, the salesman gave me a second key fob which was badly broken. I insisted on a fully functional key fob,  and had to come back later to get one. Several days later, one of the managers told me that I was not entitled to two key fobs and he wouldn't have given me a replacement.

My salesman said that the oil and filter were recently changed, but the truck's electronics indicated the oil was at 71% of its life expectancy. Now I've never heard of new oil losing 29% of its life in a short period of time.

Doubting that their alleged master mechanic had checked out my SUV, I took it to another dealer who found several issues including a reverse light which was out (a safety issue), grossly misaligned rear wheels, over inflated tires (35 to 40 PSI, not the 32 PSI recommended). I had that dealer makes all necessary adjustments,  and took the car to a car wash to get the SUV cleaned add ir should have been.

I spent over $176 to bring the vehicle to where it should have been. A Honda manager said I should have returned the SUV to Honda. I asked why since they couldn't check out the SUV in the days before I picked it up.

They also failed to tell me that the cargo cover was missing, and that it was no longer available. That would have indicated some level of integrity,  but no - not from YC Honda.

I will never buy a vehicle from YC Honda again.</text>

1000 %   great.  They treat you like you're the only customer. Drive in without an appointment, no problem. When the oil change was finished, they bought the car up WASHED other dealers do not do that.< /Text>

This was a great experience.  Dal worked hard to meet our expectations.  He addressed all our concerns and questions.  he spent time assisting us as we explored our options and end goals.  The manager was on top of everything also; no hard sell here, just plenty of support.  We would recommend Yuba City Honda to anyone looking for a no hassle, up front honest experience.</review>

I recently purchased a honda from Yuba City Honda. When I arrived, I met a young man who was a part of the sales department. Blaine was his name. He was very friendly and professional in regards to all of the questions and concerns I had for the Honda I was interested in. He spoke to all the facts of the vehicle and I did not feel any pressure to purchase. I also met Manny who is the Senior Sales  Consultant. He also was professional during my interaction. I learned about the history of the vehicle which I did appreciate. I had an overall great experience.<//review>

They are the cheapest in town when it comes to oil change. I don't own a Honda, but I still go there for an oil change. They are the only company that is using ONLY synthetic oil and nothing else. Service is fabulous, the car is given back moments after you drop it off. They are remodeling the place parking is a little crazy. Everywhere else the price is $70-$80 at Honda it's $49.99 for synthetic oil. I recommend this place. 👍</text>< Pictures>

<Time>1413260509515< /Time><rating>4</rating><Review>After reading some negative reviews, I was wary of using Yuba City Honda.  I was going to take my CR-V to another Honda dealer until I compared all of them within 50 miles of my location on the Better Business Bureau website.  I've had two very positive experiences with their Service Department in the past week.  My first trip was for a Smog Check and Multi-Point Inspection.  I thought the $1200 estimate for all recommended items was high - until I did some follow-up research.  They were very polite, and did not pressure me to make any repairs.  They even sent me a courtesy email letting me know that there were two open recalls on my CR-V (which I verified via Honda's corporate website).  I opted to go back for the high-mileage preventative maintenance and rear breaks.  Personnel were attentive, and even washed my car before I left.  They also post useful coupons on their website, which saved me 15% off my bill.

The negative side to me was the pricing on their used cars.  When I researched the vehicles, they were priced well above KBB retail values.  I won't buy a car from them, but I'll keep taking my CR-V there for service.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Bought 1987 Chevy Cavalier from them 21 years ago! They bent over backwards to help this single mom. The car lasted 21 years and if I ever get a new car, I'm coming back to them!  Recommend them to everybody who wants to get a used no lemon car. I love Yuba City Honda!! They are Number 1!!!</Text>

Bought the car (used Chevy) over 21 years ago. My son keeps it up for me but the point is they got me a great used car I could afford. When I can get enough in the future, I will buy a newer car from them. Great people, and even serviced the car for me -- you can't beat that. Please go to them for a new car. They are fair and won't rip you off. They really work with you and will get you into a car you can afford. Thanks so much for being great people. I tell everyone to go to them:)</Review>

Randy was very helpful and easy to talk with during the whole buying process.  He is also the only salesman who smiled, so, if you are buying a Honda from Yuba City Honda, ask for Randy.  However, I do not recommend using/contacting this Honda dealership via their webpage.  They do not respond in a timely manner and give the impression they do not care to make a sale.< /review>

<review>Great customer service. A routine servicing with oil change, inspection, and visor replacement took under an hour. Probably paying a little more, being a Honda service center, but the value of service made up the difference.<//review>< pictures>

The service department is excellent. Been going for years and feel they always have the best interest of me and my vehicle in mind. Luis is friendly and professional and a big part of the reason I continue going back.  Have driven a Honda since 2001 and very satisfied.< /text>

My experience at Yuba City Honda was great. Randy Breceda was awesome. He took his time,was VERY patient and answered ALL my questions no matter how many I had (I had a lot). This is the second time I've had Randy and he doesn't miss a beat. He's very personable and treats you like family.< /Text>

< Review>
Hi guys! This is long but please read! I am not one to complain but I wanted to share my experience with Yuba City Honda.
I am looking into buying a new Honda. I had been into Yuba City Honda a month previous to today and had found a car that I liked and told the salesman that if he lowered it a little less I was up for buying the car! He said no that was the least he could possibly do, I had just started looking, I was okay with it. I looked on their website about 3 days later and they had dropped the price double the price I had asked for. I was a thrown off a little but brushed it off. Recently, found a car that I wanted so I went in today and spoke to Michael. Talked to him for a bit and I asked for the extended warranty prices and he said he could not give them to me only an estimate. He said we would have to go in and do all the paperwork & run my credit. (I already had told him I had different finance options), I didn’t want to run my credit again. I told him that sounded a little bizar but whatever and he told me “YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO GET”. Brushed that off as well, well I had told him about my previous experience and it was hard for me to trust them. Well guys, Michael told me “WELL IT FEELS LIKE IM TALKING TO A BRICK WALL HERE, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU TRUST ME SO IM GOING TO GO INSIDE, I HAVE WORK TO DO. HERE IS MY CARD” and left. VERY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. I was at a loss for words. Truthfully, my feelings were so hurt! I left and called my boyfriend.. he told me to call and complain and I told him it was okay.. put some thought into and finally got myself to call. I called and asked to speak to the sales manager. I was transferred to the wrong person 3 different times. Finally, I spoke with Jackie (finance manager). I told her I wanted to speak to the sales manager and she said he was with someone that they were extremely busy. I told her I was in 10 minutes ago and everyone was standing around but I was okay with waiting. She said well “he won’t be able to talk to you tonight so you can call back in the morning”. She was SO rude! She was practically yelling at me and hung up on me. After all this, I’m shaking and call back. I spoke to Brian (Teddy Bear) and he said Jackie was with a customer and couldn't help me at the moment. I said it was okay with waiting. Then he started talking business and went off about how great he treats his customers and he could help me get a great deal. I told him I appreciated it but wasn’t looking to buy a car there anymore I just wanted to make a complaint to the manager. I told him if I could have Jackie’s last name and he refused to give it to me. He said everyone was busy and couldn’t get her last name. I hung up. I left it at that. Everyone that knows me, knows I am always so kind to others! I am not doing this for a “discount”. I refuse to make a purchase there. I would never make something up to affect anyone’s job but this was unbelievable. I was patient through out this whole situation and sat in my car crying because I was so upset with how I was treated. I’ve never experienced anything like this. I am so mad I let myself be treated like this. Some people should not be working in customer service! I understand people have bad days but to an extent. I refused to buy a car from them and won’t recommend my family or friends. RUDEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE. DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THEM!!!!< /Review>

<review>Just wanted to say thanks for the great service. I commute from Sac to work at Yuba City, on the way there my car broke down, so I dropped at Yuba City Honda for repair. It was a big Job and it was done in a couple of days with minimal inconvinience for me.
A special thanks to Eddie who provided excellent customer service.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I have used Yuba City Honda Service fore a number of years with several of our Honda's and never had a issue. In fact they in the past have always been more than willing to work with me and do their best to keep the cost down. That was up until today when I dropped my daughters car because it would not start all the time. When I got it there it would not start for the service tech either. So I was told by this service advisor Tom  that he would have it looked at but it was going to cost me $120.00 for a diagnostic check which to me seems high. Now this Tom did not give me a positive feeling with him at all in fact all I got was  a negative feeling he presented himself like he was better than anyone else.  He would not talk what I would call to me, no he talked down to me  and he did the same to one of the techs that came in. Anyway I left it these because my daughter needs it at this time to go to work. Now I told Tom that my daughter is looking o buy another car so she does not want to spend all that much just enough to keep it running for now.

About hour or so later I get a call from Tom who told me  that the ignition coil was bad it needed a new rotor and cap and new spark plugs and the cost to fix that would be $518.00 plus tax. Now that seems kind of expensive for that. So I spoke with my daughter and she only wanted what had to be done. Now while I was speaking with Tom he said the $518.00 included parts and $180.00 labor and $120.00 diagnostic fee. When I told him that all I wanted done was the ignition coil and rotor and cap done. He became rude and immediately stated to me that he was not going to guarantee the work since I was not getting  everything done that was suggested.

Now since I only had the ignition coil replaced and the rotor and cap which is less work than what was before that he had mentioned I went and picked up the car. Now this rude gentleman Tom did not explain anything on what was done he just stated your here to pick up I said yes he grabbed the paperwork without saying anything told me the price was $457.88 . I should have looked at the bill because now the labor went from $180.00 which was the quote he stated to me with everything being done to $202.00 with less work being done.

I would highly suggest anyone using Yuba City Honda Service to stay away from Service Advisor Tom he has a negative demeanor when dealing with the public he has absolutely no people skills at all.  And when you do not do what he suggest he threatens you by saying he will not guarantee the work and then basically ignore you when you pick up your vehicle. I would also highly suggest you check the labor charge because it will change from what he quotes you.< /Text>

<Text>Dealership won't stand behind there work. Installed brakes on my vehicle and it vibrates terribly now. Said replace my brakes with 50% life left or deal with it. Service writer called me back after I filled out a survey addressing my experience and got attitude with me over the phone. Great customer service lolol. Don't know about you but i will spend my money elsewhere where the parts and labor warranty are fulfilled. You would think with the countless negative reviews management would do something about it. Just shows how this circus is run.<//Text>< Time>

<text>I purchased my 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid here. It was an excellent buying expierence. They offered me discounts I didn’t know about and took over 5k off the price of the car.

More importantly, the mechanic Houa is very knowledgeable and has gone out of his way for me multiple times. Anything from diagnosing small sounds to performing a last minute oil change after closing so I can go on a long road trip.

Thanks to Houa and everyone at Yuba City Honda! I will be coming back for more free Oil Changes and hopefully free car washes after renovations are complete. 😉< /text>< response>

The service I received the 2nd time I came in to get my service done on my car was just as bad as the first time. When I first got my car in June of 2017,  my car started to flash The tire pressure light on. I brought it in FOUR times, before they actually did something about it. It was ridiculous, they kept saying they fixed it and I’d be driving 20 minutes and the light would come back on. The only reason I had my tire fixed was because a gentleman that works on the vehicles helped me out. I waited for ATLEAST 2 hours for them to fix the problem after the 4th time I came in. The service is so poor, if I could of made the decision to buy my vehicle elsewhere I definitely would of. Not to mention they won’t even bother to explain what kind of work your car will be getting done and won’t ask if you have any concerns. The bald man up at the front desk in the service department is very rude as well. You see a majority of there staff standing around when they have 4 cars waiting outside for service. There sales men are in there zone watching videos on YouTube on how to build muscle instead of helping the customers that are outside looking at the cars. The service I have experienced with the Yuba City Honda has been overall poor.< /Text>

Luis the service adviser was so helpful and patient and showed us the parts we needed on the car and how they were worn and broken.  Not sure why they said my check engine light was on,  was not when we brought it in, and wasn't when we got back in car. The cruise control  light was on.... hmm mm< /text>

<resp>None< /resp><review>I went to Yuba Honda last night to work out a deal on a CR-V. We couldn't work a deal, so I was about to walk when the sales manager told our sales guy to give me the deal. So my husband and I let them run our credit to make sure we were qualified for their Superior Tier, and we were! They come back asking me to sign off on a deal that was $750 more down and $30 more per month than what we agreed on before running our credit. Needless to say, we walked out, and they can keep their CR-V. They don't deserve our business.<//review>< date>

I took my car in because my radio wasn't working. They told me they needed to do a antenna test that cost $169.  I agreed.  Then they started looking and found a mouse had moved into my car and chewed the wires. They told me they were finished and brought me a $369 bill. I went out to try out my radio and found it was just the same - only static.

After another hour, they decided I needed a new coaxial cable - apparently they had only charged me for the antenna test, not actually done it. I had to wait several more days and then go back - driving 40 miles each way to actually get my radio fixed.

I feel they are at best not very good and at the worst, are asking us to pay for stuff we don't get.

They did offer to drive me to go get lunch both days.<//Text>

< Review>
Purchased two vehicles from this location over the last couple years, and I've learned why most people go out of town to buy a Honda. The service department needs to be completely replaced with better staff. The whole team has no respect what so ever for anyone. And apparently the bumper to bumper warranty doesn't exist at this Honda. I recommend you go to Roseville or Maita Honda for all your purchases and repairs!!!

Brought in my old 2004 civic for recall, when I came to pick it up my car ignition wouldn't start... they said that they didn't even touch my car... didn't even fix my car.... had to tow it out of there.<//Review>

<Time>1404669233656<//Time><rate>1< /rate><Text>I recently had one of the most horrible experiences I have ever had at a car dealership with Yuba City Honda. There was a particular car that they had advertised on the internet that was exactly what I was looking for. The price seemed fair and the pictures of the car they had posted looked great.
As I would be driving over 2 hours to see this car, I called and asked specific questions about it as I didn't want to drive that far just to find out that it wasn't what I had hoped for. I was told that everything about this car was great, and the specifics I asked about were acceptable. Needless to say, when I arrived, the car I went to look at was not as represented. There were big scrapes and a dent in a number of areas on one side of the car and the "touch up" they had done was atrocious. It looked like it had been done by a 5 year old. To be fair, the rest of the car looked good.
When I asked the salesman about it, he laughed and said - "Oh - haha - I guess when I went out to look at it after you called I didn't walk around to that side of the car and look at it." Like no big deal that I had just driven over 2 hours to get there. He was very rude and passed me off to a manager.
As I had driven that far, and knowing the approximate amount that it would take to fix the car, I offered to test drive it and still consider purchasing it if they would consider a lesser (but fair) offer on the car so I could take it and get it fixed. The answer was a big NO so I did not agree and I was told "No big deal - we'll just sell it to someone else like this!" Total misrepresentation of the car, and in my opinion fraud as they did not mention the body damage in any of their ads.
I had purchased many used cars from dealers, and I have NEVER been treated like this. Totally unprofessional and unacceptable.
I would never recommend working with or buying from these people.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8084acceb004efd9:0xdaaaf91554ffcfe1<//gmapID></record>

The temperature was around 100 degrees and my Honda Odyssey was blowing hot air. Not a good combination.  I needed the van to get to the funeral and cemetery, so couldn't bring the van in until after 2 pm.  We were heading back to Utah the next morning, so I knew it was a long shot.  The service guys were SO helpful!  They not only got my AC fixed within three hours but  were also able to fit in an alignment as well, so our ride home was smooth sailing! Thanks!<//review>< gmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This wonderful store is a block from our home; another grocery store is also within an easy stroll from our place, but 9 times out of 10 we shop at Grocery Outlet.  Grocery Outlet is far more affordable, the staff is friendly and efficient, and they greet regular customers by name. Most items are ‘brand name’ and perfect quality. You might have to check expiration dates on perishable items, but rarely do I find anything close to, or out of date.

Shopping here is a bit of ‘hit or miss’. You can’t go in with a shopping list and expect every item to be available. Peanut butter? Yes, but not necessarily your preferred brand. Tea bags? Usually not. But, somethings are always available, at low prices, with great selections: olive oils, wine (some real deals here if you’re familiar with the selections on the shelf) and an amazing array of table cheeses.

We typically buy fruit, vegetables, dairy products, and other staples here. Admittedly, when we do buy meat or poultry we go to the food coop or farmers’ market. If we need a particular item, maybe vanilla extract, or baking soda, or a spice that’s a bit uncommon, etc. we head to a bigger (triple the price) grocery store. But, overall, we much prefer Grocery Outlet.</Review>< pictures>

I find good deals here all the time. Sometimes jackpot finds like gourmet frozen foods that are there one week and gone the next. Good deals on fresh meat and sometimes fresh packaged salmon. That's it for seafood though, but look in the freezer section for more options. And their wine selection is pretty amazing, most bottles are between 5 and 10 bucks it seems. Some of them are very good, most are at least decent. Look closely at your bargain vegetables though, sometimes they are on the brink if you know what I mean. Commonly there's a colorful local loitering on the sidewalk outside, so if you're looking for a place to get rid of your spare change you're all set.<//Review>

<Text>I love this GO.  It is downtown and has all the best bougie, organic, free-range stuff along with the rest of the normal fare.  Grocery Outlet is a great place to buy cheese (specifically gouda for some odd reason), snacks (chips, cookies, ice cream), and that organic hippie stuff (sometimes a great deal on delicious organic granola and the like).  It's hit or miss for produce and I've found some awesome and strange decorations, kitchen items,  and reason things like essential oils or planters.

It's always worth stopping by.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>111653861990010067240< /user_id>< date>

<user>110909815710527579074< /user><review>This is a good place to shop if your gonna budget. You'd be amazed at some of the name brand items they have here such as family size keebler cookies for $1.49 and family size captain crunch for $1. NAme brand items rotate quickly. They also have cheap lighters like a five pack for $2.50 and a good alcohol section if you're ba drinker and tons on cheap cell phone chargers and accessories.<//review>< time>

This is an inexpensive place to shop (that's their top selling point) AND they have a great fresh produce section.
The staff is very friendly and attentive to customer needs.
This is a great place to shop.<//Review>

I like the store I do a lot of shopping there I go once sometimes twice a week I like the bargains the people generally courteous. Simone She's usually the cashier in the front closest to the door. He is very courteous. Very helpful. And she knows how to talk to people. And she deserves a raise.<//review>

Me and my boyfriend just adore this Grocery Outlet . Everyone there knows we love to go camping, fishing, or day drinking and they always joke about leaving work to go with us. I always go in leaving with a smile on my face and some change for the street performers outside.< /Review>

<review>This a great little market in the heart of the City of Sacramento. Lots of affordable organic choices with a fairly decent discount wine selection. Don't expect consistency with all items expect new surprises. As they close-out test market items. Also watch your expired dates. Much of the deep discounts are a result of use by dates. Which is totally fine if you are aware that you should cook the items soon ir freeze until later immediately. Overall the discounts outweigh the issues.< /review>< user_name>

<text>It's actually surprising how they're able to fit a whole grocery store into such a small space like this! They don't have the same capacity for big box deals like the other Grocery Outlets, but for a location in Midtown this location is surprisingly reliable.

Be aware that the homeless people who roam the Capitol Mall strip use this grocery store often; it's definitely not so much a problem as it is a consideration for anybody who travels through this area and is wary of the vagrant population. (Though I can say that the people who do squat in this part of town can be nothing short of delightful if you approach them with the same sentiments.)<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad0dbe4dbd383:0x7a7f11178125f87b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have visited this and many, many other Grocery Outlet stores. I avoid going to this particular store and it's not because of the homeless. This store consistently employees stone face if not less than concerned staff. It is a huge turn off, not worth any bargin any day.< /text>

However, the selection of staple items varies, so I like to go here before going on a major grocery run, because if Grocery Outlet has it, it's almost definitely cheaper. Then I can fill the gaps at the grocery store. I enjoy the variety of characters that shop here, too. Never know if you'll run into your chatty former coworker or the village grouch.<//review><date>1566765375567</date>< Rating>

It's a great little neighborhood supermarket.  Perfect when you just need to pick up a few things, and it is just a short walk from my downtown apartment. The employees are always friendly... And the prices are great.</review>

<Text>I've lived in downtown for roughly 5 years now and Grocery Outlet is my go to! Today, I came in and asked a few questions and they were answered by an employee name Mayra. She was very knowledgeable and helped answered my questions thoroughly. Her customer service and kindness is rare to come by and I am witting my appreciation for her help today. Thank you Mayra!<//Text>< pictures>

This is not my regular Grocery Outlet but the chain is one of my favorite places to shop. You never know what you'll find. Great cheese/dairy prices. Wine is fun to peruse through. I'll buy a bottle and if I like it come back for 6-12 bottles. Beer is competitively priced. Produce is usually good. Staff are generally very nice. Be sure to check always check code dates.<//text>

< Review>
I can tell that the owner takes great care in who he hires, because I’ve seen the same friendly faces for months now. The selection of available items at this location offers a lot of variety, and often times I have the opportunity to try new grocery items at a much lower price which is a nice risk-reducer. It’s a no hassle shopping experience, the wait times aren’t excessively long, and seeing familiar friendly faces (including the owner on occasions) are some of the best qualities of this Grocery Outlet.< /Review>

Not the biggest Grocery Outlet I've shopped at (so they have a slightly smaller selection), but it is extremely cheap. Parking is easy, even during the lunch rush. Yes, sometimes the lines are long and you might not find every item on your list, but is a great and affordable store in Midtown. Even better for those of us that can walk there--- but beware, you might leave with too many goodies to walk back home!<//text>

Shopping here can, and will, save you a ton of money, especially if you have a family. It is centrally located next to Capitol Park and has a stunning mural on the front and side wall. The produce and meat sections are kind of small but carry a surprising variety in selection. There is an entire wall dedicated to natural and organic grocery items, and for a store that only has 5 aisles, that is pretty great. They also have a spectacular beer and wine selection with a mega sale twice a year.<//text>

It’s a grocery outlet so it’s no frills but that’s what I like about it. Has a downtown charm that I liken to the 90s. Deals and affordable groceries. Do check expiration dates on shelved items they may be ready to expire within days or few weeks.< /review>

Fresh meat and produce large wonderful selection of dairy and non-dairy products as well gluten-free everywhere you look I have to say the store is outstanding as far as its cleanliness and sense of consumer placement I love the vegan selections more than the average store amazing products for organic you will love your experience if you have never been please try your local grocery outlet and bargain store my favorites are in Woodland California and 17th downtown Sacramento California<//review>

It's an ok store. Been to better Grocery Outlets. But if you need something really quick and you're in the downtown area they might have it. Didn't have what I what I was looking for today, but I knew it was a long shot anyway.</Review>

Great prices for everyday products. I learn about new brands thru Grocery Outlet, that are organic or gluten free which is great. Lots of healthy products to meal plan. Location is close to home, parking is a bit tight and limited at x's.< /Text>

<Review>Neighborhood savings store.. Hit and miss if you're looking for perticulars. I love the unusual items you run across for cheap! The best part is looking at the receipt at the end, usually save as much as I spend or nearly so.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Funky little community grocery. You never know what your going to find, but whatever you find it's much cheaper than mainstream grocery stores. Brand name items, gourmet items. I love this store.</Review>

Very nice location in Midtown. They re-stock frequently and have yet to see their shelves empty of any product. You can find some good prices on certain items. It's fun sometimes to just browse what they have available as well, their stock rotates frequently.</review>

Grocery Outlet is a smaller grocery store but packs in quite a bit of produce wine Meats vegetables and Dairy. They have a lot of great impulse items as well. The pricing is extremely competitive and actually dare I say some of the best prices in town next to WinCo or Smart & Final. What I do like about Grocery Outlet is there wine selection. It's always changing and evolving. They usually also have a nice selection of French Bordeaux which to someone who is not a wine connoisseur can usually get away with buying any bottle of French Bordeaux to have picked a decent wine. If you like plums and you like wine then Bordeaux just may be for you.<//review>

Great for little specialty items.  Cheeses that kinda thing. They do have very good specials but they change quickly. Don't do my regular shopping for the staples but go once a month for little treats and the such. Good spot and friendly staff. The regulars at the mid town local are a trip and I would not want to be the one who has to cope with the homeless for its one of there favorite spots becouse of the synthetic shoppers<//Review>

Although the store itself is a bit cramped and hard to maneuver when busy, the savings and employees are well worth the minor inconvenience. I regularly save more than I end up paying. Lastnight I spent $38 and saved $51... Almost $90 in groceries for $38!!!< /Review>

There are lots of good deals to be found here. I come here to buy whole bean coffee, beer and olive oil. The vegetable selection is not huge, but adequate. They always have an interesting selection of marinated raw meat to cook at home.</Review>

Neighborhood grocery store. Was a bit in disarray, looked like people walked around randomly scattered items everywhere. But I know where items are usually stocked so it was a quick run in and out. Pity the clean up crew.</Review>

What can I say. The best place to shop in Midtown is Grocery Outlet. Forget about the operated overpriced stores. Grocery Outlet. This is our Midtown store.< /text>

Neighborhood grocery store. Was a bit in disarray, looked like people walked around randomly scattered items everywhere. But I know where items are usually stocked so it was a quick run in and out. Pity the clean up crew.</Text>

Not as good anymore since new management took over, I'm sorry to say. Bargains are few and far between, and items not restocked in timely manner. Store personnel, however, are great and really trying. Hope it gets better!</review>

Eating organic can be expensive, but you can do it by shopping at Grocery Outlet.  I know because I've done it.  NOSH (natural organic specialty organic) products are increasing all the time at GO because customers demand it.  So, now you can get grass-fed meat, pasture raised eggs, all kinds of USDA certified organic, non-GMO verified, you name it, for roughly 30-40% less.  Kiss Monsanto goodbye.<//Text>

The first Grocery Outlet that I went to was in Monterey when I was on a trip with my lovely group of Girl Scouts. Amazed by the prices and an overall decent selection, I decided to find the nearest one to me. Granted this is not it, but it is very convenient to my uni. I like this location because it is simple to locate (right off of L street) and is one of the newer stores in Sacramento. Like earlier reviewers have said, it has a grande selection of every cheese imaginable and if I were thinking at the time, I would have picked at least two to have an awesome and simple dish of macaroni pasta. I must say that they have a good selection of wine and beer! I liked the easy layout of this particular Grocery Outlet, but it is on the small side. I would only come back here again to pick up something for a meal later on in that day or for some of their cheeses. There really isn't much to this store.<//Text>

Very affordable location. They may not have everything you're looking for, but as a supplemental place you can get staples and deals on overstock items, and the owners of this location are in touch with the community. The first aisle often has pretty good deals on non-grocery items like holiday stuff, makeup extras, salon/hair products, protein/dieting products. Small fruit/veggie section. Lots of processed food aisles. Workers are laid back and helpful. Parking is easy. Beware the pushcarts if you park on the street, because I got embarrassed when suddenly my pushcart when over an invisible line and the wheelblockers were activated and I thought i ran over a rock or something, until somebody told me "hey! you cannot push the carts to the street, they boot the wheels!" Ohhhhh.<//Text>

<review>The first Grocery Outlet that I went to was in Monterey when I was on a trip with my lovely group of Girl Scouts. Amazed by the prices and an overall decent selection, I decided to find the nearest one to me. Granted this is not it, but it is very convenient to my uni. I like this location because it is simple to locate (right off of L street) and is one of the newer stores in Sacramento. Like earlier reviewers have said, it has a grande selection of every cheese imaginable and if I were thinking at the time, I would have picked at least two to have an awesome and simple dish of macaroni pasta. I must say that they have a good selection of wine and beer! I liked the easy layout of this particular Grocery Outlet, but it is on the small side.

I can't say this is a typical grocery outlet store, but I enjoy shopping here for good bargains and what nots. I typically go down every aisle to find things I need and others I didnt know I needed. The produce here always looks fresh and it's a pretty clean store also. And if you love wine, they have a selection that could rival Trader Joe's in volume and price. Overall, a good place that could either be your go-to store, or a store that has weekly bargains as the inventory continues to rotate based upon the popularity of the selection. Glad they're here.<//review>

My office is near this Grocery Outlet so I shop there pretty often. However it's one of the smallest grocery Outlets there are. The stock is always relatively low and limited in the variety of things they carry because the store doesn't have a large capacity. That said, the owners are known to promote anti-LGBTQ beliefs, and since learning that, I only shop there if I absolutely need to grab something while I'm at work and can't get to the CVS a few blocks down. The employees are nice and I definitely give them props for the struggle of dealing with shoppers. I've seen shoplifting happen at the store many times and I don't envy them. They're always on the lookout.<//review>

Smaller store with a slim selection of goods, but the location is amazing. Perfect for a quick shopping trip and is usually cheaper than Safeway.<//Review>

Some prices are the same as Safeway sale items. Watch the expiration date on items. Poor produce.</Text>

The prices can't be beat, especially in their NOSH (speciality/healthy). It's one of those places where you walk in for 2 things and walk out with a cartful. Lol. It's magical. They have stuff you won't see anywhere else too! Seriously the best.</text>

It was okay. Some items is cheaper than the big stores. They don't keep common items like others stores. When they run out they don't know when they will receive  them again. That really it sucks.</Review>

<text>One of the smaller stores, selection is ok  and is comparable with other G.O.s  in the local area. One thing that brought it to two stars, was that the staff had no compassion for my daughter who was basically crying because she had to go to the bathroom so bad. They forbid their own customers access to the bathrooms. What grocery store does that? Terrible business practice imho.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>The store is clean very nice employees, But  I brought it up almost every time I'm there and I shop there often is the Hard Rock music that they play in there is very distracting and irritating to me and I've asked people that work there and I've asked people that shop there and they all agree but they're not the boss so I wish you would please change your music at the store thank you very much.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809ad0dbe4dbd383:0x7a7f11178125f87b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
