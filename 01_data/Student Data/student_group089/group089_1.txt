Called looking for a quote to replace the power panel on my 50 year old home.   The call was answered promptly with a response that I needed to contact the electric company first as it was a whole process which needed a permit.  Then an estimate of $7K - $10K cost was given to me.   This estimate was 2x more than another quote I have from a local shop who included in the quote doing all the preliminary with the power company and permits.   Either the person I spoke with didn't want the work or this place is a total rip off.   Would never do business with them.< /Text>

Fantastic, friendly service and very fair pricing! We really appreciate them coming out as soon as they could to fix our defective light motion sensor at our office, so we could work comfortably. Darla in the office booked us as soon as she could and when an earlier opening came available, she was able to get her team out several days ahead of schedule. We highly recommend Roseville Rocklin Electric, Inc.!</text>

<Review>The outlet controlling my master bedroom and bath lights went out yesterday evening (loose wires as it turned out), which made it a safety hazard for my ill husband at night, who could not understand why the lights were not working. I contacted Roseville Rocklin Electric this morning and the company was able to make an emergency visit and fixed the problem in just over an hour from the time of my call!  Outstanding service and repair, which was so greatly appreciated!  I will definitely call them when I have need in the future and I recommend them for any electrical work you may need done.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Roseville Rocklin Electric installed an outlet behind our mounted TV. They worked efficiently and for a fair price! Also, I appreciated that they wore masks and booties while in our home. We will definitely be using them for all of our future electrical needs.< /Review>< name>

<text>Working with team RRE was an extremely positive experience. From the project manager all the way down to the electricians preforming the work. I highly recommend anyone who is doing an electrical project to contact them before you sign up with any other electrical contractor. They were on time and on budget. They brought conflict in the MEP to my attention that the design team overlooked. Truly a first class experience. Thank you Kevin for having and leading such a great organization.</text>< pics>

Everyone from Kevin (owner) on down was extremely professional, helpful and worked diligently to straighten out a challenging scenario.

Ron worked very hard to be as unobtrusive as possible despite this restaurant being up and running.  It is a very busy location, new staff and  management but he got them back on line.  Very Professional job<//Text>

Great experience using this company! They answered right away and were able to tow our company van within 30 minutes. I received many text updates and photo confirmation that the van made it to the mechanic safely. Would recommend!</Review>

Gotta love it., they were able to manipulate my transmission to get a safe and good tow over to the nearest shop. They were on time and knowledgeable. Appreciate them getting me out of a pickle. And  great prices!< /Text>

Locked keys in my truck per usual. I had called around at a few towing companies for service and many were charging 85-90 dollars! Came across Mission Valley towing and spoke to Floyd. He’s had the best rate of anybody that I had called and was very kind and easy to talk to over the phone.

In a timely manner, he was able to come out to where my truck was, and was able to very quickly get my keys! The whole experience was easy and Floyd was very personable. He offered me several solutions as to accessories I could very easily buy for my truck in case Of future lockouts! I often lock the keys in my truck several times a year!

If you need towing service, call Floyd! He’ll be very prompt and will kindly offer his services to get you out of any towing pickle that you might find yourself in.<//review>

<text>This man has helped me tow my vehicles 3 times this year, without fail. Communication skills on point, always answers the phone, always on time. Takes his time with loading the vehicles, does accurate recon before loading and safety is his number 1 priority. Punctual, very good prices, and always willing to go out of his way to help you out. Not only does he run a good honest business here in San Diego, he truly serves the community every day. I highly advise to use his services if you’re ever in need of a tow, a lot of places might do the same thing but this guy definitely cares about you the customer, and it shows in his work.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Floyd is the man! He was super helpful and on time. He even correctly diagnosed what's wrong with my truck (fuel pump). I had my truck towed to a larger known repair shop and suggested that I go somewhere else. He was genuinely concerned that I was going to be overcharged for the repairs. Which, I was.< /Review>< Pics>

These guys delivered OUTSTANDING service! I spent a majority of my morning calling around trying to get a quote only to run into automated machines and being told that I’d have to schedule appointments. I gave Mission Towing a call and received a quote swiftly. The truck arrived less than 30 minutes after the initial call, got my car onto the bed in about 10 minutes and was on its way to the auto body shop. Also, the pricing was extremely reasonable with no extra fees or surcharges. I can truly say that I am thoroughly satisfied with their service and I would highly recommend if you’re ever in need of a tow!</text>

<Text>My SUV died in Sea World traffic on Friday evening, it was really busy out. I found Mission Valley Towing, saw the stars and some reviews and made the call. Floyd arrived in great time and had us loaded and on the way to the garage very quickly and professionally. Besides being good at what he does, he is a really nice person.<//Text>< Pictures>

Mission valley towing helped me move my car mid restoration. They paitiently helped me pull a non-working  car out of my garage and then helped me push it into the garage at my new location! I’ll definitely be using them again!!</Text>

Floyd picked me up in 20 minutes and dropped off my car at the mechanic ON LABOR DAY. Great guy, has a lot of experience and a great tow truck. Dropped me off at my apartment before getting on the highway just because he's a nice guy.

10/10 would highly recommend. Great service :^)<//Text>

<Review>Unbelievably the battery in my Nissan 350Z went flat again while we were away on a 7 day vacation.I called Mission Valley Towing straight away and spoke to Floyd who I booked to come out early the next morning. Floyd jump started the Z and even waited around to make sure it was charging up.This is the 2nd time in about 12 months I have used Mission Valley Towing and they were fantastic both times.Floyd keeps the prices low and the service high.What more can I say?</Review>< username>

People need to shop around before choosing this guy. I was in San Diego visiting my family and had rough time with my car. I called him up and he charges too much just to go a couple of miles. Not friendly either, if you're having a bad day then don't take it out on your customers.< /review>

Where do I start ? My in laws have used this place many times over the past 20 years. I remember an accident mission valley towing went to 10 years ago. Everyone was fine and floyd recommended this place to get the car fixed. Ive used this place at least three times. The insurance company has paid me back. Always on time and never a problem. Floyd is very kind and considerate to everyone. Thank you thank you.< /text>

< review>
I called Mission Valley Towing because they were the highest rated on Google in my area. I was happy to find out the reviews were correct. I had my car towed about 15 miles at rush hour, but he was still kind enough to knock some money off his originally quoted price. He doesn't act like this job is a chore, as this is his own business. He is efficient, kind and was generous enough to let me ride with him to my destination (mechanic). He took are of my car and me. I felt very lucky to find him and would highly recommend calling!<//review>

Mission Valley Towing has been great. Our car was towed from a busy freeway in Orange County to a recommended repair shop for repairs in San Diego. All was done well. I have relied on Mission Valley Towing for my towing needs for several years.. I've had jump starts, battery replacements, towed my car from Old Town to Kearny Mesa Toyota, and another time from my house to a shop recommended. I've found Mission Valley Towing to be reliable, on time, fair priced and competent. I heartily recommend Mission Valley Towing.

Want to add that Floyd with Mission Valley Towing just towed our camry again to Darby's body shop in normal heights. Will report later with Darby's how the job turns out. So far I'm happy with the fast and complete service we've received with Mission Valley Towing. Thank You.</text>

Horrible! Located less than a mile away from this place and needed a tow to an auto shop because my car wouldn't start and they refused to come out without an explanation other than "I won't be able to make it out to you." I asked if it was something where I needed to wait and he referred me to Western towing which is way farther from where I am located from. I asked to speak to a manager and he said that he was one. I let him know that that was unfortunate and hung up. Not sure where the 5 stars came from for this place but I am disgusted and now stuck stranded in this complex. I will be calling this place tomorrow and requesting to speak to the real manager.< /Text>

< Review>
I adore this place! They give first-cleass meals, their menu is large, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I enjoy very much tasting all their food. The food is consistently of high class, the service towards the clients  is nice. I visit often this place and I not even once was disappointed. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Because the food is constantly coming out with new freshly cooked trays of food. At times you also have to wait in line because people rather eat here than the Mexican restaurant right next door that seats there empty looking at China Town Express getting busy.</Text>< pics>

This place has THE BEST ORANGE CHICKEN I've ever had anywhere!
Regular and Spicy.
I always get just the Orange Chicken, no rice. It's best freshly cooked, so usually around opening, lunch and dinner. They give really healthy portions too.
Better than the fanciest Chinese Restaurant! Everyone is always friendly and they remember me. I only get take out. It's small, and I live down the street so it's perfect to take out for me.< /text>

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
The Cashier who attended me was on her phone and instead of washing her hands after, she immediately started to grab the food and food item! VERY UNACCEPTABLE!! Our phones have so many germs and bacteria!I had to ask her to wash her hands and her idea of washing her hands was to rinse your hands under water for 10 seconds! You shouldn't even have to ask the person handling your food to do that! They should already know! The only reason why I'm really bummed out about this is cause of the WHOLE COVID 19 PANDEMIC GOING ON! This is why things are not getting better! Please care about yourself and the customers! This also refelects on Managment. I used to love eating here, but after today I won't ever be coming back.<//Review>

<text>So, I gave it 3 stars because my fave dish is Orange chicken. But, the chicken tasted like it was microwaved! Very disappointing. I won't be going here again, that's how NOT good the Orange chicken was.< /text>< rate>

<text>Drove by  this place and decided to try it out but once inside the place looked questionable didn’t look to clean but I said what the hell  i am hungry!!! Should have followed my gut feeling and walked out I was sick for a full day until the next day I thru up the food never again, the sad part that I’ll be a bit scared to try the Chinese food else where .

<review>They give portions of food based on race, the staff there are really rude and disrespectful they give more food to the customers that appear to be Latino/Hispanic and that is totally not fair but what really takes it too far is when the staff is talking about the customers in Spanish while they are making the plates! I know this to be true because i am of Cuban decent and speak Spanish however i have darker skin and get mistaken for African-American all the time (no big deal to me) but when i went in there with my boyfriend who is African-American and ordered some chicken one of the staff says in Spanish "We don't sell fried chicken here" and the lady who was making out plates busts out laughing. Terrible customer service the food is okay rather blain in  flavor and too greasy, the peas in the rice always have freezer burn and the tables are never clean. It really sucks because back in the day i loved that place now it is not up to par. May be time to reevaluate the staff!< /review>< name>

<review>Con artists: ordered kung pao shrimp the whole thing was just watercress and TWO shrimp. Beware if you are ordering off the menu, they will take advantage of it. It was already expensive for what it was. Never had a takeout place do something so blantaly fradulent. Not only will I never come back to this place, I am going to warn as many people as possble. Hope this place gets shuts down.</review></record></dataset><record>

They place shrimp pan next to fish. Even the shrimp touch the fish pan. I saw customer conplain about it but she said i did not put shrimp on ur container sir... no problem...   after serve that cust... she eat herself lunch  at the corner steam table than serve other customer when they came without wash her hand.  Looks they need go to health classes to get sertification.<//review>

<text>My best friend special ordered a bible cover for my birthday online. It was delivered to the Camarillo store and i was called that it was ready for pick up. When i got there they had no clue where my bible cover was. It was paid in full ! I had the receipt as proof. As the gentlemen and his wife searched for it they couldn't find it. I looked around and spotted it on a shelf on the sales floor. I was told i took too long to pick it up...( it was paid in full ) i dont understand why it was on the shelf??  I was very disappointed. Thank God i spotted it. Im very satisfied with my cover, although the gentlemen apologized... the service was very disappointing.<//text>< Pictures>

<Date>1594675908832< /Date><review>My wife was able to take her falling apart bible in this morning to have them send it out to re-bind it. She said that Jane was just so lovely and helpful. My wife was so grateful that there was just even a Christian store around anymore in southern California since all the ones that she had known had all closed or gone to on-line only. So great to still have a brick and mortar place left to go to for things like this. We will definitely be going back.</review>< response>

Christian Family Supplies (CFS) in Camarillo is a must.  Jane and Paul are always so welcoming and helpful to the patrons in their shop.  There is everything for all your spiritual needs and a gift for for every occasion for everyone.  And this is without a doubt one of the most beautiful stores in Camarillo.  I can browse, and buy of course, forever.</review>

<review>This store is super cute and I've been wanting to go. I finally got the chance to go today and I loved it. The lady working there was sweet and engaging. The store has a very unique large selection of books, gifts, homegoods, etc. I will definitely return for more things to decorate my house with and devotional journals for my studies.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

They want to provide their customers with quality Christian books & movies which definitely makes them stand out from any other Christian Bookstore I've visited.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Fairly good selection of books and misc Christian items.   The staff helpfulness was a little on the weak side,  but that may be that they don't like African-Americans coming to their store.   It's a christian store but doesn't mean they are Christ like!

I still give them 4 stars.< /text>

Bibles, gifts, Christian literature, church supplies and a treasure trove of used books out of print. I have only found one seminary with a better stocked theology section. AND  if they don't have something you need they WILL get it for you, no problem.< /text>

Parking isnin the back of the building.  Clean place,, polite employees,  You can inrole in their reword system.  They have Bilingual, or just English or Spanish Protestant bibles. A few Caltholic Bibles.  English or Spanish version.  The Catholic is the New American Reviced Bible (whitch is more easily read than the original Shakespeare type of read) Oxnard and Ventura no longer have a Christan store. So for the West side if the county ,  Camarillo is the place to go. Or  the Mishion gift shop in Ventura, witch prices are a bit higher.< /text>

Raceway did great work! They were very fast and took care of several things in my home all in one day, including installing a whole house cooling fan. I highly recommend them.< /text>

I love the clear communication before the appointment. I had complete information of what the job was and how long it would take and what I would be charged. The text even included a photo of the electrician who was going to do the work. Billy did a perfect job and we will be definitely be inviting him back to do more projects.</Text>

<text>From start to finish I am completely impressed with Raceway Electric. Mike (the owner) came out to my home and discussed with me what projects I wanted done. After the meeting I was provided with a complimentary quote and lighting options.

Our condo complex needed to upgrade from fluorescent lighting to LED. We had everything you can think of. Porch lights, pool lights, parking lights and pole lights that needed to be replaced.

The two electricians, Billy and Sam,  arrived at the beginning of the appointment window and walked the job with me. I knew I was in good hands with these two. They arrived clean and ready to work. The electricians worked in separate areas of our complex to ensure the job was complete in great time.

Our new lights look amazing and definitely bring more of a stylish look to our complex. This was a much needed upgrade and we could not have done it without Raceway Electric!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dbe2c5b1a648c1:0xb355b4bb21efa9cc< /Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating><user_id>110957620162712716868< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Billy was on time, and very professional.  I didn't really care how the power got from A to B, but he made sure to make it more aesthetically pleasing.  Definitely would recommend!  Thanks guys!!</Review>< user>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We bought our first house recently and the electrical was not allowing us to function. We quickly needed new outlets in the kitchen, outside, recessed lighting in the family room, entrance way, and kitchen, dimmers in the bedrooms, and there was a ceiling fan that was moved unprofessionally that left live wires hanging from the ceiling. Mike came out shortly after I called and did a complete walk-through. He was beyond nice and didn’t want to go with any other company. The two men that came to our home to do the jobs were unbelievably nice and professional. They genuinely enjoy their jobs and walked us through everything that was being done. At no point did we have to question a thing. Mike even came by during the job to check in. Such a great company and couldn’t thank them enough for helping us with our home. *HIGHLY RECOMMEND*<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Mike is really great to work with.  He is very straight forward, explained things in a way I could understand when installing my solar panels and upgrading my electric panel.  I am very happy with the install and so glad I chose Raceway over several other companies I considered.  I highly recommend Mike and Raceway Electric.<//review>

<text>After recently purchasing a house, we needed to have some minor electrical corrected, and several fans/control switches/can lights/dimmer switches and a stand-alone RV power outlet installed. We heard about Raceway through our realtor (who had used them for a number of years for their own properties). On the day of installation, Billy and Sam arrived on time, and were very professional and personable. Billy took our requests/needs into account for the install, and suggested very logical options that would work for the room size. We went with Billy's recommendations, and everything turned out excellent! They both worked very efficiently and answered any questions we had along the way.
Thank you guys!

A few weeks after the install, we noticed one of the fans (Brand: Minka Aire)  was making a ticking noise while operating at higher speeds. Raceway sent Sam to take a look. He figured out the problem in a few minutes, and made the correction (putting two 2" sections of gasket material 180deg apart between the ceiling and the base cover). No more ticking!!
Per the fan retailer and Raceway, this is a common issue with this brand of fans.

We intend to use Raceway for future projects.
Highly recommended!< /text>< pictures>

My experience with Raceway Electric has been a positive and professional one. A friend recommended Raceway Electric for my electrical upgrades, and I'm extremely happy that I contacted them. Mike provided detailed recommendations on the issues I wanted fixed (bathroom & kitchen outlets, recessed lights, moving outlets, grounding issues, etc.), and informed me about electrical standards and code. The staff is always quick to answer and return my calls, which I think is a sign of professionalism and taking their business seriously. I would highly recommend Raceway Electric to friends and family.</text>

I was using a previous electrician but they increased their rates quite a bit.  Found Raceway Electric in Santee Magazine and thought I would give them a try - keep the spend local.  I am so glad I called! Sam is wonderful - I am getting ready to bring him out on a third job for us. They are now my go-to for any electrical work I need. Highly recommend them.<//Review>

Mike and his crew removed my solar panels so his roofer, Ferraco Roofing, could make the repairs to my roof to stop the leaking. I had another company install my solar 8 years ago and I wish I had Raceway Electric do it back then! Mike’s crew did a great job removing the panels and then reinstalling with all the correct stands and flashing to ensure a great leak proof installation. My favorite thing about Mike was his attentive and prompt customer service. He answered his phone or called me back every time. He communicated every step of the way and his crew was on time and got the job done on schedule. Very professional company and great service. I would use him again and I will be recommending him to anyone that needs electric repairs, installation or PV solar, Raceway Electric ROCKS!<//Text>

Mike at Raceway Electrician is very experienced.  Watched him work on a panel inspection and replacement.  Mike is always doing his best to inspect electrical systems while taking note of the accompanying warning signs (if any).  Electrical systems catch most homeowners off guard and seem to break out of the blue.  Mike coaches everyone take note if flickering lights or appliances start running out of the norm.  These are usually signs of an electrical issue taking place.  Call Mike before this issue turns into a house fire in the middle of the night.</review>

We had questions about our electrical panel and needed some recommendations.  We found out about Raceway from three different sources and gave them a call.  Mike came out to our service cal and was very detailed and informative about all our questions.  Mike recommended a simple and basic panel inspection and evaluation.  Mike had his office set up an appointment and about two weeks later a tech came to perform the inspection.  Both men were extremely professional, courteous and answered any questions or explained any work.  Definitely would use Mike and Racdway again.<//review>

We were a first time customer, we needed our old ceiling fan removed, a new fan relocated in the living room and a new ceiling light installed where the old fan used to be.  Sam arrived on time, was courteous and professional.  He got right to work and got the job done in a timely manner.  We were so pleased, that we have a few other electrical issues we need to have addressed and fixed and we will be calling Raceway in the near future to take care of them.< /Text>

Raceway Electric is an excelllent company.  The technician, Billy, was prompt, courteous, and professional.  He quickly identified the issue and fixed it.  He also answered my questions about a few other issues I was concerned with in my older townhouse.  I have them coming back to give me some estimates on replacing a panel and some other work.  I highly recommend them!</review>

We called Raceway because we had flickering lights in several rooms. They have a good website with their contact number easily visible and an option to book an appointment online based on a menu of their services. I thought that was clear and convenient. I booked an appointment online and someone followed up by phone to confirm the details. The Electrician showed up as scheduled and was able to resolve the issue although he warned us that there could be further issues with the electrical panel but he recommended seeing if the problem stopped there before going further. We did have to call them out again because we saw flickering lights in different rooms now. The owner himself came out the same day we called and resolved the issue. I was impressed with their technical knowledge, responsiveness, and professionalism. No complaints. They are not cheap, but electrical problems are not where I try to bargain shop.< /Review>

<review>Since a major demo we have continued to have major electrical problems and feared that an incompetent contractor left us with a possible whole level to be rewired. I was able to schedule an appointment for less than a week later, Mike showed up within the time frame given and after discussing the issues at hand he went to work immediately testing all electrical outlets (he looked concerned with our same thoughts on rewiring). In about 30 mins he was able to find that all these issues were related to one single broken electrical outlet, he looked more relieved than I was! Mike was very excited with his findings and demonstrated that he is truly passionate about his work and providing exceptional customer service. I would highly recommend them and have not had any issues since!< /review>< pictures>

<review>I had two ceiling fans put together, wired, mounted onto ceiling where there was no light before.  The work was done quickly and very well.  I highly recommend having Raceway install your ceiling fan and do any other electrical work.<//review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I would like to say how happy I was with their service.  Mike was quick & efficient and took care of the electrical issues I was having. In the process, he found an issue with the electrical box, which he took care of also! So happy I found Raceway Electric!< /text>

We obtained several quotes for installing a NEMA 14-50 outlet in our garage to charge our electric car. Raceway Electric was the cheapest by a considerable margin and I appreciated Mike's professionalism and expertise as he offered different options for what they could do. The service was scheduled promptly and the technician arrived right on time. Raceway Electric will be my first call if I ever have electrical needs in the future and I heartily recommended them!< /review>

<Review>The Raceway worker installed a ceiling fan and wall heater at my father's house.  He was on time, professional and did an excellent job.

They were prompt and did a great job installing the two outlets and security light. They cleaned up after the install. They were quick with the install and it only lasted about 2.5 hours.< /review>

Our kitchen remodel required new lighting installation and upgrades.  Raceway Electric was referred to us when the original planned electrician had a delay in keeping to our remodel calendar.  Raceway Electric came in on short notice, surveyed and rebid the project.  The upgraded lighting is fantastic.  The work crew, Billy and Sam, did a great job.
We will most definitely consider Raceway Electric to work on future lighting/electrical projects.< /Text>

We have used Raceway Electric for our solar panel installation and we are very happy. They worked closely with the roofers because we were getting a new roof, too, and that really helped make things go smoothly. We also used them recently to replace a breaker for our jacuzzi. They were punctual, courteous, and got the job done.< /Text>

<Text>We needed some electrical work for a back yard project. We called Raceway and they responded right away. We got our estimate the same day they came out to look at the project. The pricing was very fair.  Not only did they show up on time, but they were very professional, they left everything very clean, & their work was spot on. Would definitely recommend them.< /Text>< user_name>

Raceway Electric took care of wiring up a remodel for us recently. They showed up on time, took the appropriate amount of time to troubleshoot the existing issues and after laying everything out so it wouldn't interfere with any of the other work going on, wired everything up. Their worker was knowledgeable and moved proficiently through the work space. They left the site clean and ready for the next stage. I will be using them again in the near future on more projects.< /Text>

<text>Can’t say enough about Raceway. After getting a tankless water heater installed I needed to move an outlet. I call Raceway and set up an appointment. Mike showed up and not only installed a new outlet he realized my garage refrigerator was plugged into a faulty gfi outlet and switched that out also. Mike was on time and extremely friendly. I highly recommend Raceway for any of your electrical needs.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Always on time. Always courteous. Always professional. Small jobs like outlet replacements to large jobs such as main panel upgrades to solar installation, they do it all and everything in between! Raceway Electric is my electrician of choice!< /text>

This is the second time we've contracted with Mike and his team at Raceway. After our kitchen was done, we decided to get some lighting in our living room. Living in San Carlos, our home was built in the 50's and had no attic space. Thankfully Raceway was able to install our lights with minimal drywall work to be done. We are very pleased with the outcome and the service we've had with Raceway.< /text>

Billy did in 1.5 hours a job that a previous electrician couldn't do in 3 hours. Have been using them off and on for 9 years and they are reasonable and reliable.< /Text>

<Review>Very professional! Mike came and gave us an estimate. He was very patient while we change our minds probably too many times. His office staff is also super accommodating! Can’t say enough good things! Lights look great and the house was clean of all debris when he left. The estimate was the price we paid, no changes or overages! Thanks!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>We had Raceway out to make a repair on a rental property we own. Quick response, good service, and a reasonable price.

Mike also inspected the panel and made a few other good, reasonable (i.e. HONEST) recommendations. With the liability involved in owning rental properties, we appreciate that a little preventative maintenance will save us a ton of time/money/headache, rather than waiting until a tenant has another problem!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dbe2c5b1a648c1:0xb355b4bb21efa9cc<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Oldie but goodie. Good 'ol Sebastopol car wash. Sign is iconic, and the place still offers a cheap great place to wash your own car and throw in a few quarters and vacuum too. Only $1.25 for vacuum, and $2.50 for carwash. What a deal! Machines and hoses almost always work, there's a quarter machine to get your quarters, and garbage bins all over. One of the best deals in town. (Pics were taken on a very smokey/ashy day from the nearby fires).<//Review><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808430b064821239:0x91a2f933fa80b391<//gmapID>< Time>

We come here fairly often to keep work truck clean. Happy with the job it does and the convenience of 24hrs. My truck broke down here and the customer service line actually got through to someone so we could get permission to leave it until it got towed to a shop. Very nice.< /text>

This is a relatively basic a car wash, the do-it-yourself kind with a large wand but all the base also have a scrub brush which is excellent and the are vacuums to clean out the car. The best thing I can say about it is it is well maintained< /text>

First, this car wash is open 24-7, Google Maps told me it was closed on the weekend. Second, it is awesome and the bays are plenty big enough for tall vehicles like my Transit van.</review>

You couldn't ask for a nicer more honest p8erson that has worked not only my truck but I trust them to fix or repair my family's cars my wife's, my daughter, and my son cars. This is a top notch honest and quality shop for sure. No worries or concerns.</review>

The three men that worked here were very friendly, helpful & fast! I had trouble getting my smog passed at first, so with some advice from them I was able to fix the problem & passed smog no problem!!  I’d recommend them to my friends & family & look forward to future business with them 😊
They had restroom use which is a plus when you have kids! & was VERY clean!
Thank you again Metro Balderas Smog!!!< /Text>

<review>I don't say this about many businesses in KC,but this guy, Brian,is the best! He went the extra mile for me, came to my house, charged the batteries, drove my vehicle for me,did the smog,and had the truck back to my HOUSE, in two hours! And I wasn't charged an arm and a leg. I am disabled,and I appreciate the service,he is the only one I'm going to from now on.<//review>< gmap_id>

<text>Had the most amazing experience during my super time crunched moment to get a smog check on my vehicle. I forgot it was the year to get a smog so when I didn't receive my vehicle registration after I paid online and waited almost 2 months, the DMV informed me I needed a smog check first. So my mother recommended Metro Balderas and when I called they were extremely nice and helpful. I got my vehicle smog checked in less than an hour and they were even super helpful throughout my whole encounter. I highly recommend Metro Balderas Smog Check.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8092f0d9abc1522b:0x29ad1a049cb74a89<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great experience getting my smog check done.  The technician was courteous, service was fast, and price was reasonable.  I called in and they were able to accommodate my request to have the service done within the hour.  A little tricky to find the first time but once you know where to go it's a piece of cake.<//review>

<text>The technician/owner, Brian, is good at what he does; he is also courteous.  He went the extra mile to help me with my vehicle.  He also valued my time while accommodating me on short notice.  The only criticism I can make about the garage is there is limited parking space since it's located in the alley, but we can't control geography a whole lot.  I highly recommend this smog check station.  Also, the owner informed me he will be doing lock and key service soon.  All in all, time and money well spent.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Great service. I came in without an appointment, but it wasn't an issue thankfully.
May be a bit hard to find, it's down the alley to the right of Napa, just keep going till you see the smog signs on the left.< /Text>< user_id>

Jazzy and cozy--Ro cafe has a calming vibe in this bustling city.
Pros: Customer service and food is great! Their avocado and egg bagel was fantastic. Plenty of outlets if you're looking for a place to work. If you're looking to treat yourself, their Kurdish Pancakes are a real treat.
Cons: The food takes a while to prepare! Be ready for a wait. On the pricier side for cafe breakfast.
All in all, I love this place. Definitely plan to be a regular here.</text>

Charming little place with excellent food and great coffee.
I tried the “Siyaglor”, a Kurdish style chicken and was fantastic. Good portions and great pricing.
Tip: Try the baklava! Great dessert with a hint of lemon.< /review>

One of my favorite places in the Richmond District of San Francisco.  Love the Kurdish food and the owner, Havin. All the dishes are made by her, including the pastries.  The lemon baklava is great.< /Review>

Also love the couscous salad, cake, and honey fig tea. They are planning on expanding the menu in January 2016. We'll be back.</Review>< pictures>

I am rating this based on the
oique and well crafted food.
I believe the food is Kurdish.
If you are a foodie ...
U should try it ...
Refreshing tasty and new food experience

Used to be at the Richfield Coffee location.
Think about it ...
If it wasn't very good ...
I wouldn't had dropped by out of my way
She handcrafted her products.
Per order she doesn't slap something together
She put her heart into it crafting it to please
Like my mom would ...
detail, focus, aiming to please via
Spending effort and detail< /Text>

I got the beef sandwich and the meet tasted like jerkey. Super dry, thin and extremely salty. The whole sandwich was so dry I couldn't swallow it without some water. The service was slow too even though there was no line and not many people.</Review>

<GmapID>0x80c2599f6ece6f57:0x79ff5267a9023db3</GmapID><Text>👍😀👍I am extremely satisfied with the entire service with Sears Appliance Services!👍😀👍
I started with an online service request and was able to see the dates and times that was available to select from. It also shows what the flat rate service call costs. You select the type of appliance is and a drop down for what type of service you need as well as if it's a repair, what the issue appears to be. It's a convenient and easy to use process!
Once you book the appointment, you are kept up with emails and/or text messages regarding the appointment.
If you want emails, you will also receive one that includes the name and a picture of your assigned Service Technician before your service date.
You also have the option to change the date and time if needed. (Which I did due to a necessary medical appointment.)
The Technician called me a couple of hours prior to arrival to advise me he was on schedule as well.
My Technician was wearing a face mask, Very Professional, Courteous, and asked me to review in detail what I had been experiencing with my appliance. Once he determined what needed to be replaced, he advised me of the Total Cost that was all Inclusive.
I authorized the repair and he had the part available in his vehicle.
All said and done within an hour.

Sears actually contracts services to authorized small appliance business. Mine was Cristo Appliances. He was Early on Time Window, explained the issue, had the parts and did a thorough Quality Check afterwards. So far, no issues with part replaced. Good job!<//Text>

we purchased a Elite Kenmore refrigerator from the Sears store 4 years ago and 5 years warranty agreement..  last week it stopped cooling.. call out Sears to fix the problem.the technician came and checked. Finally he talked with my husband that the refrigerator’s broke 2 items one is cover by warranty and other was about $1000 to replace it. Maybe he know how much you get the refrigerator and he know how much if you get a new one.Why I said that ? Because when I said too expensive for repairing how come a refrigerator still in warranty but I have to pay $500 to get a computer and $500 for the installation fee!!!! Warranty equals NOTHING! This is a $3500 refrigerator we got from Sears! IT COST YOU THOUSAND OF DOLLARS TO FIX A REFRIGERATOR WHICH STILL IN WARRANTY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? finally he find out we are not gonna take his suggestions he said he want to purchase our refrigerator but he won’t give offer just see how much we want to sell it out. Can you imagine this? Finally he said he can give a discount about $700 to fix it totally but we have to get a Sears home service plan $30 every months not a month! Do you understand? It means you have to pay $1000 for fixing it whatever. So disappointed with Sears! We had get a new refrigerator from Costco already and I will call other Company’s technician to check how much for fix it again. I WILL NEVER EVER SPEND ONE MORE DALLOR ON SEARS ANYMORE!< /Review>

< review>
Purchased Kenmore Elite from Sears three years ago and now it stopped working 7/5. Called Sears and they said I would have to pay for parts that were not covered on warranty and labor. This on top of monthly warranty fees. A month and $700 later, I still have not had my refrigerator fixed. Had four appointments and when they did show up, they installed new parts and ran out the door even though we told tech compressor was not making any noise. Now 4th appointment tech says the parts we received were no good. Wants to order other parts and come back in another week. That’s it! No more. Sears is not what it used to be. They are sending A&E repair which are the worst. I’m done with Sears! and do not purchase Kenmore Elite anything because they are made by LG, who has a class action suit against them for knowingly selling refrigerators with faulty compressors.<//review>

<text>The technician did not fix the water heater. He replaced the burner, but it was not the problem.  The MAIN COMPLAINT IS HE DID NOT TIGHTEN THE TUBE/LINK TO THE GAS AND WE HAD A GAS LEAK.  I HAD TO CALL THE GAS COMPANY AND THEY SHUT THE GAS OFF.  Another technician came out on 6/15 and fixed the problem, which was a sensor.</text>< pics>

<Text>Service was great.  However, I am still very unhappy that before work would begin I had to agree to pay for damages to my property if caused by your technician.   This still makes no sense to me whatsoever that you want me to pay for damages caused by you.  Major head-scratcher from the realm of insanity.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>My experience began in November and  ended in May!  My microwave carousel stopped working.   After about 5 house calls by Sears it was not fixed and,in fact, my microwave stopped working altogether. There were 3 or 4 more house calls before our local store manager got involved and only then because my son went to the store to complain. That manager promised me that he would either see it fixed or replaced.  After 2 or 3 more visits they replaced the whole inside of my microwave.  It finally works.  The only good things I can say about this experience is that the store manager was a very nice guy and made sure he followed through.  He also loaned me a microwave to use while mine was not functional.  The guys who finally fixed it were very nice guys.  Sears should be ashamed of itself for letting this go on so long.!!!< /text>< pictures>

The service was great! It was thorough and include assistance over and beyond what problem had been reported. I really appreciated the visit and Sears choice of the service person sent to investigate my issues.

If i could give Sears and their protection plan a negative 5 rating i would.. we purchased a Elite Kenmore refrigerator from the Sears outlet store 4 years ago WITH a 5 year service warranty agreement.. worked fine until last week when it stopped cooling.. call out Sears to fix problem.. the tech they sent out was at our home for less than 5 minutes and was rude and told my wife that he could not find a model number on the refrigerator so he did not have to work on it.. the tech then sent a email to us WITH THE MODEL NUMBER ON THE EMAIL saying there was no model number and he could not fix it.. we then call the Sears protection warranty number back and the service lady ( who was friendly) said that they have all of our purchase records and that the warranty was still in effect.. she said she would reschedule another appointment with a different tech but could not until Monday..meanwhile all our food had to be thrown out... hundreds of dollars of food.. the window appointment was from 10am til 2pm.. the same tech responded by calling my wife on the phone saying he was not coming back out because the refrigerator didnt not have the model number on it.. mind you that Sears confirmed that this is the same refrigerator that was purchased at the Sears outlet with a current protection warranty.. however the tech refused to call Sears to confirm but threatened my wife by saying that if she called again that she would be charged.. so we called Sears back.. the next serice rep could not understand why the tech could not fix the refrigerator or call to verify the model number.. after being transferred to different departments Sears had come to the conclusion that the model number was not on the refrigerator and SHOULD NOT have been sold... this is a $4000 Sears Elite refrigerator that had a minor scratch on the side so Sears Outlet sold it to us for about half the price WITH THE PROTECTION AGREEMENT THAT COST US HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.. Sears said all they can do is refund us back $62.... Dont buy ANYTHING FROM SEARS OR THEIR OUTLET STORES UNLESS YOU DONT MIND BEINGING SCREWED OUT OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.... Sears is going bankrupt maybe because how they treat their costumers ...maybe their costumers wont return back to buy anything else like we wont either... Now we are in the process of finding a Attorney to sue..also when we asked about the food lost Sears said that the tech was suppose to verify the food lost but since he could not or WOULD NOT verify the model number all the food could not be covered... SEARS was effortless with their help</text>

I have been having the same problem with my Kenmore range since I bought it. When Pete came up he figured out the source of the problem and took care of it. I no longer have to worry about when my oven will go out again. Thank you Pete.<//Text>

I was very satisfied with our Sears technician. His knowledge and attention to our needs was beyond 5 stars, thank you so much! All is well with our LG refrigerator and we can now get back to being normal people with food in our house.

The reason I gave the service 4 stars is because of issues beyond our techs control, so it doesn't reflect on him whatsoever. The person I initially spoke to when the fridge croaked (to schedule a repair) was a little on the goofy side. He seemed bored and wanted to talk about anything BUT scheduling a tech to come out. Not a big deal, but when he scolded me because I was surprised that someone couldn't come out sooner, I was not so amused anymore. He said I should be happy with the time frame I got, because some people have to wait for weeks before getting an appointment. WEEKS? Seriously? Just to find out what's wrong?  That seems a bit harsh. I'm not sure if he was serious or just messing with me.

Our tech was very thorough to make sure he pinpointed what was wrong. I'm very happy he did, it's hard to find people who take the time to do a job right anymore. He explained everything he was doing, so it was nice to be informed and understand exactly why the fridge broke down. But, me being the nosey person I am, stuck around when he called his boss and overheard him getting in trouble for taking too long. I was livid! TOO LONG? Of course I bugged him until he admitted that he been scolded because on a past job he had not being more thorough. Really Sears? My husband didn't want me to mention this because he was concerned that our tech might get in more trouble. If that's the case, then maybe Sears is not the company we care to deal with. I'm surprised they can keep their employees if that's how Sears treats them.

Our tech was amazing, I would give him 5+ stars. Sears? Getting 4 stars is being generous.< /Text>

If I could give negative stars I would!!!!!
Last June I had my fridge and freezer stop cooling to the proper temperature. We had a service repair man who had no idea what he was doing. I'd ask him questions and he'd just say, "I don't know I just fix the problems." He quoted me close to $1000 in repairs.. which is crazy!!
I called to have another service guy come out to give a second opinion. Sears sent the SAME GUY! I had filed a complaint about the guy and they sent him back to my house.
6 weeks later and 4 service guys I FINALLY got my fridge repaired. I called corporate to file complaints I called Sears to file complaints.. no body could care less about the trouble I was put through. Now here I am in November.. just before the holidays and I'm having the same problem with my fridge. And you know what they told me? Your 90 day part guarantee is up, so this will be a new charge. My fridge is less than 2 years old. I'm never buying from Sears again!!< /Text>

I did have a problem with my washer before I went on vacation and I made an appointment for when I will return from my vacation.  The technician came when I came back home and repair the washer but the washer did not drain when I put a wash load that same day.  I called right away customer service and the representative told me that there was not an immediate appointment.  As you can imagine I was full of dirty clothes so  it was an emergency for me to wash my clothes.  The customer representative went the extra mile to get me a closer appointment because she was very understanding of the problem I was experiencing.  I am very happy with the customer service I received and so happy that my washer is fix.<//review>

First the technician that diagnosed the problem and ordered the replacement parts ordered the wrong parts.  This was not know by myself until the repair technician came to repair the broken refrigerator.  He put on the replacement parts and ran another diagnostics on the refriderator and found out that the original part was still good and the control unit was bad. I was expecting the part to be delivered two days ago, but am still awaiting parts and still have no Refrigerator.  I am also wanting to know what will happen to the parts the technician left here from the first repair?

The Sears track record is not going good for myself right now.< /Text>< pics>

Our appointment was rescheduled without our knowledge then we found that it was in the message received prior to the original set time and day.  When the tech came it was very hard to talk to him since he did not speak English very well and his comprehension was a bit limited.  Additionally, we had difficulty understanding.  My wife made an appointment initially for a service maintenance check along with a repair to the door switch on the washer.  This was not coded properly so the tech was not prepared for any repairs and he could not do any service check on the washer.  He said he would scheduled a repair service for the following week.  He spoke to a women on the phone who attempted to instruct him that he had to close out the current visit with the proper code before he can schedule a new visit for the repair.  He obviously did not understand what she was attempting to explain to him so he just hung up.  He said he would schedule another appointment for the repair.  When I received the email re: the rescheduled repair it was for a service maintenance check and was set for July 16th, not June 6 as he said he would.  I am very concerned that our rescheduled repair that has been schedule by us will end up in another botched attempted  since the email we got for this repair still only says service maintenance check without any indication for a repair need.  Visiting techs need be well versed in English, both speaking and comprehension in addition to whatever their birth language is.  This was a very frustrating visit.  On a plus side the tech was polite but he was getting as frustrated as we were due to the language barrier.< /review>

The service representative was scheduled to come between 8am - 12pm.  I took a day off of work to be available.  The service rep showed up ant 12:50pm, almost an hour late.  Furthermore, he continued to ask me questions about the error code I received on my dishwasher and what it meant.  I had happen to read my manual, so I was aware the error code was that there was hose and/or blockage issue.  However, I had to show him my manual for him to tell me the same thing my manual stated.  Moreover, I was supposed to be scheduled to have my refrigerator serviced as well. The service rep stated he was only scheduled for the dishwasher.  I specifically scheduled a service call for both the dishwasher and refrigerator. I thought the fact he was almost an hour late and did not call to inform me he was running late the least he could of done is just looked at my refrigerator.  I thought my entire experience lacked  "good customer service" along with the chat line I used to schedule my service.< /text>

Now I have to wait another week for the tech to install them.  The washer is another story!  During the second load I ran the same problem reoccurred.  Now I have to wait almost 2 more weeks for a tech to come back out!  At this point I'm not unhappy with the tech, he thought he'd fixed the problem.

<Review>The Sears Employee came at the last hour 1700hrs, he acted like he was so tired (dragging) in my home. He failed to even check behind the appliances to see if there were any items that may have needed attention. I only buy Sears products and have never received any bad service from their repairmen until now! If he needed any assistance my husband and I were home and would have gladly assisted him in whatever he needed. Instead of him asking for assistance, "he stated on the receipt the space was too tight , appliances too heavy to move."  "WTH" you're a Sears repairmen you should have all the tools to assist you in every situation. I guess good quality help is going out the window with everything else...< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Took two extra weeks to complete a washing machine service that only took ten minutes.  Unacceptable and a sanitation issue for my home-business. This driver was not able to find my home, and I had to go get him.  He turned off the gas to my dryer, so I found a load of wet clothes after the cycle.  The washer works fine now, but the delay for a paid service was unprofessional, and I will not buy from Sears again unless their service department is upgraded in the future.<//Review>

Your service SUCKS! I had a 5 year warranty on a "kenmore washer and dryer" from you. It was a gift from my husband. Your warranty is a joke. When I finally got a replacement after getting a damaged unit your store screwed me! I could not get the replacement model on line but I was railroaded into a cheaper crappier model that I did not want when I first got my set. So I bought a 21 hundred dollar unit to get a replacement that ended up being under 11 hundred dollar unit that has gone to destroying my close.

I have had years of not one tech coming to my door. And the ones that have come out here never listed the problems. This last tech was such a moron he WATCHED MY UNIT HAVE POWER BUTTON ISSUES!!!! Not bothering to put this on the report. He just notes that my unit is fine and I am using something other than Tide detergent.

The Sears Store in Palmdale CA is complete crap!!!! DON'T BUY FROM THEM!!! I PAID FOR SERVICE for my Kenmore vacuum and got it back beat up and not even cleaned!

Never again will I give you business. Your warranty is a joke, my money was wasted and I have no lost several grand in clothing from a crappy unit that was never protected nor could your techs even do their job!!!!<//Review>

<username>Eileen Wright< /username><review>I with there were negative marks to highlight instead of stars - they don't deserve any stars.  I have had an exhausting interaction with repair men.  I have a free standing ice maker and the repair company kept putting a ticket in for a refrigerator ice maker. The first tech didn't know what to do - his response was it was dirty and to just clean it.
Second tech finds my ice maker is under warranty and I need to call GE.
I call GE get the run around but finally an authorization to have it covered under warranty.
Third tech says I have to cancel the call because the ticket was set up incorrectly - refrigerator instead of stand alone ice maker.
In the midst of calling GE again - I now am waiting to talk to fourth tech.
I am going crazy<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

However, he replaced the part he said was broken but the dishwasher still was not cleaning the dishes and still making the same noise. Two days later my husband came home to a flooded kitchen and garage. He called Sears and they said the first available appointment was 5 days. There was no help for five days and we had to turn off all the water to the house. My husband ended us calling another appliance repair company and they came out immediately and turn off the water to the dishwasher!!!!
Then told my husband the dishwasher would cost over 500.00 to fix. Now I have water damage and had to file a claim with homeowners insurance and buy a new dishwasher!!!!!
Sears repair did state they would refund the cost to repair the dishwasher but not the
$ 59.99 fee for coming out.</Review>< Pics>

REPAIR PERSON ARRIVED ON TIME.  CLEANED UNDER THE FREEZER AND SAID THAT THEIR WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE APPLIANCE.  CHARGED ME $100.00 AND LEFT.  THE REFRIGERATOR STILL MAKES THE LOUD NOISE SO NOW I WILL HAVE TO HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO COME AND FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT AND FIX IT.  VERY DISAPPOINTING, TO SAY THE LEAST.</review>

Excellent technician. Part came right away but appointment was 10 days from assessment. He was very professional.

Also the third technician to believe Sears should replace my rusting washer.<//review>

our washer broke april 30, the repairs were not complete until the 18th. The first repair man who looked at it saw water in the tub and automaticly said it was the pump the next week they replaced the pump just to find out that was not the problem. Took us another week to get the parts. The service dept was helpful gave us a 50 dollar gift card to help with the cost of doing laundry at the laundry mat. I still feel it took to long to repair a washer that was only 1 1/2 years old.< /review>

<Text>Improper diagnostic, repairman claimed it was the door latch switch on dryer when in fact it was a faulty wall plug outlet.  Repairman failed to return on date promised and finally when he did arrive and installed new latch switch he had to use a different wall outlet to make it work which tells me that the wall outlet was the problem in the first place.  Repairman refused to give me the phone number of his supervisor.  Dealing with the sears phone personnel is frustrating and at times impossible, I spent over 2 hrs on the phone and was disconnected three times and was never able to talk to a supervisor. .  I find that there is no accountability in the Sears appliance repair program.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1532373584275, 'text': 'Hi Dick!

<review>It has a big parking area. Store is very clean but I've noticed it's never crowded and it could be because of its prices. Even their clearance rack is expensive, in regards to it's price I give it a 2star lol
The only reason I go here is because my husband is a big guy whose tall and likes to grab certain jeans and accessories.</review>< Pictures>

Walked in for the first time.  Was so happy to see real sizes and a great selection.  Brent was very patient and did not hover over us while we were shopping.  Went out of his way to make us comfortable.  Was immediately ready to search for the items we were looking for. Will definitely be back.</text>

They have everything from more of a budget to premium. I recently gained weight due to health issues and started out with Men's Wearhouse, but lately they aren't stocking many sizes and selection is becoming more and more limited both in-store and online. Kind of get the feeling that they're on their way out of business. I'm so happy I discovered this place though. Also, they do have 1x and 2x sizes for those of you that aren't that big.</Review>< pics>

I stopped by to search for what I learned to be the smallest size DXL sells, but I still enjoyed looking around the store for ideas for a tall friend of mine who has issues finding clothes. The customer service here is excellent! They're readily available to help you find what you need and answer any questions you might have. They even offer to order an item you need shipped online while you're in the store seeing items in person.
While their prices are more expensive than what you'd pay at another store, they do have a small discounted section in the back of the store near the tailoring mirrors. I recommend this store and company to those looking for quality long and tall clothes.< /Review>

<time>1619124846384<//time><Rating>4</Rating><Review>Esmeralda and Jose tool great care of us! Overall great service and food was pretty good too. As far as something that would stand out, not really. Food portions are generous and it's enough to have a second snack especially if your having dessert. Place looks clean, lots of seat both inside and out. Food takes a bit to come out but worth the wait.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa1CdZj6dirTkROwHxzUGIQ4T-8IRwAx0hqUg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYQmv8x4x2MjzCCY3a3lLLigcrdABFGUfw6jk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoaxUMRwpygOPcdvz4hxEg_iI8lWReuNBz4ik=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP40B3tLKyPrmkFf-GkbyxPLr8u4kNsY4ZbaVA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAfz4Jnu8vs383n_55Ze_nU1vziAxEgVoPIR4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt---id0ushPPrw1m6q52EUVKL6JNFyBF1mSE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Fun spot for excellent deli lunch when want to get away from tourist area. Indoor and outdoor seating.

- Stellar diversity
- Large menu
- Efficient service
- Friendly and engaging manager / host
- Decent value

My lox and bagel were great. My wife's order was incorrect twice.

Large table and sufficient room.

Reservations are available in Open Table...would definitely recommend making them prior to arrival.< /Review>< userid>

<Review>I absolutely love my visits to Palm Springs.  This visit I discovered this place.  They have the best deli food! They have something for every one.  I love their veggie sandwich, breakfast, meat sandwiches.  They have fast become my favorite place.  I have never had a bad dish.  Their food is fresh and delicious! I’m only sad they cannot come back home with me.< /Review>< Pictures>

From the outside, I thought this place was going to be more upscale than it is. The interior just looks dated and worn. But the staff, huge menu, and great food were better than I expected.  I don't usually like fries, but they have the big thick kind I like. There were 4 of us and we all really liked our meals.</text>

The atmosphere was nice and distanced. They checked out temp before we were seated. The staff was friendly, clean and fast. The food was great with large portions. We had a great experience. Definitely worth a try!</Review>

<text>Excellent.
Excellent in every way. The food, the service - everything. If you are looking for huge portions of fantastic food (each item we got could have been 2 meals), you should try this place. Highly recommended!<//text>< pics>

<Text>Great food served up with an unfriendly attitude. I walked in, asked for some takeout bakery and deli items. The person that filled my order was rude and abrupt like they were doing me a favor. I ordered sliced cold roast beef, and specifically asked if the meat was rare. The answer was YES. Sure enough, when I got home and prepared a sandwich the meat was well done, NOT rare. Overall a bad vibe in this place. Too bad because the menu, which is overpriced (for example $7.95 for a milkshake), contains some dishes that you can't find anywhere else. I wouldn't mind paying the jacked up prices if the atmosphere was welcoming. I will never ever go back to this restaurant.<//Text><Name>Keith Jacobs<//Name>< Time>

Decided to try this place out, after constantly going to another well known deli in the area. I wasn't impressed. The portions were large, but the meat tasted bland. They offered no pickles with your deli sandwich (probably had to order separately). Tried their desserts and was quite impressed with their cannoli's. They were very delicious. Also tried their tiramisu, carrot cake and fudge cake. All were good. I might come back when the other deli is too busy.< /Text>

Generous portions, huge menu with things you can’t get anywhere else, and amazing deserts.

Authentically Manhattan Deli, sometimes including the attitude! But don’t worry, they’re softies inside, just like some of their deserts!< /Text>

This spot knows how to do REAL sandwiches and the bakery items are superb.  I got the French Dip, the au jus is full of flavor, beef was tender and delicious, and the steak fries are a must! The black and white cookie is massive in size and absolutely delightful, soft and delicious.  If you're in the area, you have to check this place out.</text>

<Text>I learned a valuable lesson when dining here. Never order a Greek Salad in a deli or at least this deli. The Greek Salad appears to be a hodge podge of salad greens and vegetables left over in the kitchen served with a side of red vinegar.< /Text><UserId.>110631458657762308624</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

The options here are endless! Over 100 sandwich and breakfast options. The also have a pastry case and deli counter. Quality of the meats is very good here but a bit salty. Overall had a great lunch here, not full five stars because the interior was worn out and could be cleaner. Ask for any condiments you would like when ordering as the sandwiches are served dry.< /Review>

A huge selection of fresh and tasty items on the menu, friendly service, and far too many freshly-baked desserts.

Get the half salad unless you have a very big appetite.</Text>

<Review>I live in Las Vegas and our friends introduced us to Manhattan about 11 years ago when they lived in Palm Springs. Now they live in Pomona and had a hankering for Matzo Ball Soup which was funny because my husband and I had been talking about it not too long ago. After a phone call and email,  we found out they had outdoor dining, we hopped in the car just to go get soup!!! It is seriously some of the best matzo ball soup we have had and it was worth the drive. We even ordered some to go for our son who also loves it, but wasn't with us. Corned beef sandwich was so tender as usual. But the soup, oh man.</Review>< resp>

Made reservations, arrived a little early. Was not a problem. We picked outside such a lovely night.
We decided because of the traffic noise we would pick inside next time. Greeter, server, set up lady were all very gracious did there jobs with expertise and very accommodating.  I look forward to bringing friends back to the Manhattan.< /Review>

I never had kosher food although I had read and heard about it. no artificial flavors are ingredients all natural and fresh products. It was like learning to eat all over. I'm sorry but the dessert really got me, real cream whipped and sweet. Real puff pastry. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We both had Reuben sandwiches and they were great. Every time we go we try something different and this last time was no exception. Although we had to take it to go.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

<Text>Ahhh Manhattan's in the desert! What a treat! I've enjoy many meals here and last visit no exception. I always love the BBQ Ribs...how amazing! But, last visit they were out of a few favs....and had to select another. Always true to be a great restaurant and wonderful staff. They have done some remodeling and it looks really nice. It's always a great choice for many items...and don't forget dessert....they have an awesome selection to cure and sweet tooth!!!</Text>< Date>

Great New York deli in palm Springs. Great staff, (Claudia). I ordered the rueben with pastrami and corned beef, with a side of fries. The sandwich was very tasty, but I was disappointed by the amount of meat on it. I looked at pictures of the food before going in and felt the amount on mine, vs the pictures was lacking. That won't dissuade me from going again. I also order a slice of cake, to go. It was HUGE. They had to slice it in order to get into the containers. It tasted very good too.<//Text>

Excellent food with massive portions. You'll get at least two meals out of your sandwich. The desserts are inhumanly large - we got eight servings out of a single piece of carrot cake.
The menu is similarly massive, with pretty much everything you've ever seen on a deli menu.</Text>

Manhattan in the desert has it all for a deli experience..  The staff is exceptional and always friendly the sandwiches are out of this world.. Cindy at the dessert and togo counter is so very nice and efficient. She really embodies the image that matches the fun vibe of Manhattan in the Desert... and if you're not in the mood for sandwich their burgers are amazing and their breakfast is incredible. I can't say enough good things about this place and it's a lot of fun<//Text>

<Text>Second time back this trip. Great friendly service. We had a French dip and a Manhattan foot long all beef Frank with homemade chilli and cheese on top. Both meals were amazing yummy. We also had Pepsi for our drinks. Don't forget to get your homemade desserts on your way out. Cheese cake best in town. Enjoy.<//Text>< pics>

Whenever I visit the Coachella Valley, I make it a point to stop in and get my NY deli "fix" here at Manhattan in the Desert. Hands down the BEST deli style establishment. Yay for the pickles and kraut (better than the "other deli" in town. If you want to enjoy a sampler plate...opt for the tuna and egg salad combo with potato salad, cole slaw, and fresh veggies. Don't miss the pastrami or the rueben!!< /Text>

<text>Amazing food and portions! You must absolute ask for the pickles at the table and try the sour tomatoes. I asked for my potatoes to be extra crispy and they delivered. You are gonna love the latkes, the grilled breakfast sandwiches, and the bagel and lox! Also, try the bakery items, they are very inventive and tasty.</text><gmap_id>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d<//gmap_id><user>114557026879524426610<//user>< Time>

Food is amazing. I was at a party that catered in fact. The staff is actually really friendly, but my rating is based on the lady we had. I think she was just ready for the day to over. It is really pricey though and normally I don't worry about thinks like that, but a sandwich is average 15-17 bucks here.<//review>

Great place to bring groups. Lots of big booths and tables, and the menu is huge, so even the picky eaters and vegetarians have lots of options.<//review>

You will see. This is a very popular eatery with all the freshness you  would expect from a top deli. Friendly service, extensive menus. Great bakery and a sense of community. Great cocktails. Kids menus. Quick bites. Deliveries.</text>

Lookie here lookie here! This place right here, now I cant speak on the rest the food but the desserts!? Theyre amazing. Stopped by twice so far since Ive been in Palm Springs these couple weeks to grab a dessert to go. The cheesecake slices are huge, about the size of a grown man fist! I cut it into quarters to eat it. The flavor is amazing, the presentation is wonderful. Establishment is clean and the staff is friendly. Definitely a recommended place on my list for places to go in Palm Springs.<//Text>

I haven't had dinner here yet but I did go only for the dessert this time and what a great choice! I had the strawberry shortcake and let me tell you, it was three best I've every had in cake version. Enough for three people and prices are incredible for the quality. I'll be back with more friends and the bf of course!! 😁<//review>

<Review>I've frequented this restaurant for 2.5 years. And I've always ordered the same two dishes, either the huevos rancheros or the Cobb salad. During the pandemic I encountered a few mishaps when ordering orders to go which was absolutely fine considering the circumstances we were all facing. But today I was taken aback when I went to place my usual order but was told my substituting blue cheese for feta would be a $2 up charge... For cheese crumbles!! Never been charged for that in the past. Nor has any restaurant ever charged that much for a substitution for something as minor as cheese crumbles. And as a buyer of feta. From different regions, I can't imagine this restaurant having the very high end feta cheese to justify a $2 charge. So sadly I will not be returning any time soon. As a long time customer I felt insulted.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Huge sandwich just like in New York!! The Pastrami is tender and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were good but the horseradish sauce will clear your sinuses.  That's what I'm talking about!! Authentic flavors and ingredients you'll love!!< /text>

<text>Nice building and grounds. Very busy but not a long wait. All food very tasty but macaroni salad a little heavy on the mayonnaise. Not a Weight Watchers special. Service a little slow because of the crowd and staff ilness. A little on the steep side for what was served but tasty. Will return if in area again.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Easy going and awesome foods 🕺 classic old school plam springs. NO OFFENCE but me and my girlfriend where the youngest people by 40 years and we're late 20's 😂 but was still cool. There is a small Jewish bakery in the front. Good alternative diner for a Sunday instead of queues for the "trendy" spots pffftt. Get the pancakes</Review>< Pics>

Food was AMAZING! I drove from San Diego just to see what all of my friends were talking about. It was well worth the drive. The owner was very welcoming and the staff really made me feel like a valued customer. I am definitely going back!</text>

<review>Manhattan's in the desert is a restaurant that specializes in Delicatessen Foods. They have a large menu and the portions tend to be on the generous side. The food there is usually pretty good and the service was very attentive. If you're looking 4 a scrumptious sandwich this would be the place to get it. The restaurant also has a bakery that tends to sell items that are on the very large size. If you're going for lunch or dinner make sure you ask the waiter to bring you out pickles. They have pickled tomatoes dill pickles and kosher style pickles. They also make delicious omelettes add egg dishes and french toast dishes. They have a lox and bagel plate that is quite good. Manhattan's in the desert is a good place for breakfast lunch or dinner.< /review>< pictures>

It wasn't what I expected (no fault of the restaurant's). Food: the fries were lousy; the French dip was marginal. My wife had blueberry pancakes and said they were delicious. We had a brownie sundae, which was huge, enough for four people. We took home more than half of it. Service: they were very busy - it's obviously a popular place - and badly understaffed. As a result, service was slow. I haven't been back, so I've no way of knowing if that's the norm.< /Text>

Staying in PS n drove by a couple of times. So we stopped.  Service great, thank you Fuzzy.  From the host, server n to the table attendants was an A rating.  The cornbeef dinner w cabbage was an A+.  A must try.  A little pricey, pastrami sandwich was $17.99 but more than enough for 2 people. Was very entertained by a man n woman who both got the fish n chips.  The woman ate more than half n then complained about the the fish.  The man devoured his, but Fuzzy handle it well.  Even asked if she could get her something else.  Nope she was full at that point.  Yup, the woman just didn't want to pay.  What a scam. Why do people do that n 10 to 1 she didn't leave a tip. 😠  Fuzzy provided great service w a smile to that woman n her table of five.  A must try, huge variety of meals n desserts.</review>

Step back in time to a previous era and imagine the dulcet tones of the Rat Pack complementing your cuisine. The MITD Diner has a super cool Neo-Retro Ambiance with a broad array of menu options-Kosher and Non to meet your gustatory requirements. Portions are large and are suitable for sharing. Our favourite breakfast in the desert.<//Text>

So, we didnt call our  order in before getting their. It was Sunday(Father's Day). My dad's wife & I stopped in the afternoon and placed our order. A personal white pizza, pattymelt & a Reuben sandwich. The cook accidentally made a Hawaiin pizza. Well we dont eat pork so taking it its place was impossible. So we waited longer to get the right pizza. Because we had to wait (45 mins) we were given the Hawaiin pizza and an item from their bakery. The food and pastries ( we bought some sweets too) was delish! Only downfall was the wait time - regardless of the wrong pizza being made. Call first and order, check it before leaving & you'll  be more than satisfied. You'll  be Very happy with their food. A bit pricey but TOTALLY worth the $.< /review>

Food was good my first time having take out from this restaurant but next time I will be sitting down to enjoy the food.  The manager was very helpful because I was having a small issue getting out of my car..but she had her staff bring my order right out to me.. I would always give 5 stars because of the customer service A+++</text>

Manhattan Deli is the best deli in the desert, hands down. They make all their meats fresh on the premises, which is one of the main reasons it's so superior to it's closest competitor. Their bakery and dessert items are also fresh and delicious. In the summertime they have several dinner specials for $12 or $13 - it can't be beat anywhere. Their portions are huge, I can only ever eat half and take the rest home, then I've got another full meal. Their staff is friendly and attentive, the restaurant has nice decor and a pleasant atmosphere. Conveniently located.<//text>

I really enjoy eating here whenever I am out in the low desert. The food is good, the portions are large, and the desert is the best I have had in Palm Desert. I recommend the Carrot Cake or Tiramisu. The only thing I think is a detractor is the menu. It is very large. Probably over 100 items. If you like options, you'll find them here. If you like simplicity, you're better off sticking to the larger chain restaurants.<//Review>

Been dining here for quite a while and finally getting around to writing a review.  This is a great place for deli style food but for me, the best breakfast is the huevos rancheros.  What?  Yes, of all places, a NY style deli with a delicious Mexican style breakfast.  If you try it, beware of the jalapeno peppers on the side, they can be quite hot.  Service staff is always friendly and efficient, restrooms are clean and ample parking lot.  Bakery goods are also quite delicious if a bit pricey.<//Review>

The service was amazing at this location. The servers were very respectful, and they made me happy to be there. The food was also delicious. The Cinnamon Swirl Panvakes were definitely the best pancakes I have ever tasted.</Text>

Good food. Had the corned beef and cabbage and country fried steak,  both were big portions. Plus it was between 4 - 6 pm so we were able to advantage of an early bird special and saved $3 on each meal.<//Text>

I used to love this place but the last 3 times I have been there I have been very very disappointed. I live in a 55 year old and older community who  just had them catter our saint Patrick's day dinner and it was terrible not one person had a good thing to say about the dinner and the food.It was not good at all we were all very disappointed with the food.And that is over 100 dinners.</Review>

Great place for a bite IF: You are in no hurry. I’ve been here when it’s packed to being a ghost town. And the service takes FOREVER. Excellent food though. The knishes are fantastic HOWEVER, You might want to wait 10-15 minutes to eat it. It came out absolutely scorching hot, even blowing on a bite didn’t help.</text>

<review>This is like going in Manhattan and ordering at a Kosher Delicatessen, the pastries cheesecake all the food, everything is excellent.
YOU  can't get 4 in California light roast beef dippers all kinds of things just you have to go there and know it's not cheap. Jack in the Box is a real place I suspect they spend a lot of money on water treatment because their pastries are so light and fluffy they taste like they were made from water right out of the alleghenies.</review>< UserId.>

If you want AMAZING DELI food THIS is the place! We had breakfast- my husband ordered the "Pastrami and egg breakfast sandwich" on a bagel and it was HUGE! It was offered on 3  different types of bagels and my husband asked our server Felipe C for an alternative flavor and it was no problem! Then I thought I was going to be a real problem child when I gave Felipe my order. I wanted the "Tongue and egg" with hash browns but I really wanted it made hash style. I explained it to him and he told me it was absolutely no problem and my breakfast came out a beautifully cooked ""tongue hash".
The portion was huge and all at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!!!
This is the cutest spot, great attentive service with prices that are commensurate with the quality and quantity of the portions. I don't think they're overpriced at all. Just bring an appetite or take home a doggy bag!< /text>

1st time here, recommended by a friend. Love the eclectic deco. Interesting dining room layout, broken into sections with different heights. Staff was friendly and service was good. Ordered an Italian sandwich and the deli meat was piled on high! and taste was flavorful. The french baguette was fresh and light. I didn’t have an opportunity to try any pastries but I will be back.< /Text>

<Text>The service was FANTASTIC! We were seated quickly and the hostess was great! I had the hot pastrami and corned beef combo and it was delicious and pretty big. The deserts were very good as I took home the over sized Ding Dong, very tasty. I would highly recommend doing there and I will go back as I noticed other plates of food looked great as well. Thank you for a nice meal Manhattan in the Desert.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Irregardless of how good the food is and how slightly overpriced everything is, the only real problem I have with this restaurant many of the counter people are just plain unpleasant and kind of rude. If you go to Sherman's you'll find that the people there are really friendly. If you disregard the the unfriendliness of the people working the counter this place is great.< /review>

<Text>Very big and good sandwiches. However the prices are really high! I got 2 sandwiches one for me and my partner at my work. It was over 50 dollars! Now it was very good and the portions well they was really really big. The customer service was so so. Not good not too bad. They also charge extra for every little thing want a yellow chili to go with you sandwich that will be an extra $2.25. Come on most place have that for free. So despite the good sandwich with large portions the price is really dam high for a sandwich.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
You know you had a great meal when you are talking about it a week later.  That's our experience!  My Ruben with pastrami was one of the best I've ever had and my wife had the carrot cake french toast, it was very good, a bit sweeter than I like, but she loved it.  Quick service and very fair prices.< /Review>

Love this place. Some of the cooks came from Canters in Los Angels. Great traditional delicatessen fare. The pastrami sandwiches are exceptional. Had breakfast recently, the latkes were perfect. I usually have the matzo ball soup -- which includes carrots. The pickle plate has pickled green tomatoes, unusual but still good.< /text>

Breakfast, for me the Last platter split with my dad, excellent bagel's, fresh veggies , came with coleslaw and potato salad, all was good.
The location is wrong for this place but this property is in a nice setting. Beats the PD location by a mile, much better.< /review>

Staff started to be very attentive until we place our orders.  Coffee hit the spot and the refills they kept coming.  After waiting 20 min plus other guest were being served excepts us. Finally I said to the server what happen to our order. He said I will Check n find out. We got our food most of it was already cold.  I jus wanted to get out of there. My first time being here n service was really bad.</Text>

Although this is a long time, well established restaurant here, tonight was the first time I went after all these years visiting and living here.
The service was outstanding and very personable - I loved my waitress. The food was good with large portions. Plenty of parking. On a Saturday night, at 6:30 pm, in the middle of 113° heat, the place wasn't completely full but almost.
I had clipped a $11.99 summer dinner coupon that motivated me to come by. However, it was part of their normal menu, but no big deal. I'm sure they will continue for the remainder of the summer season.
Large and varied menu that should handle most people.
I ordered the turkey dinner which came with soup or salad, roast turkey slices, and two vegetable sides for $11.99. Drink was extra. As I said earlier, the portions were very generous and I left stuffed. However, I couldn't resist getting a Key Lime Bar to go. With tax and tip, the total was under thirty.
A couple of weeks ago I went to Sherman's, which is surprisingly similar in every way. However, of the two, the food and service at Manhattan was much better. Cost was the same for their dinner special.
With Manhattan's other restaurant in Palm Desert closing recently, for which I hadn't heard anything good about, I was hesitant to come here. But not now as I look forward to coming back soon.
Definitely a place I would recommend.</text>

This place is a winner every time.  Huge varied menus, great value on the whole as portions are enough for 2 meals. Get a take out box! Summer menu is always superb value when low season and desert heat kicks in - but you have to ask for that menu! A Palm Springs tradition- Manhattan Deli!!</text>

Great New York style eatery.  Lots of options.  Perhaps too many...
Food-wise:  You can never go wrong with a salad or sandwich, which are all HUGE.  Dinners are very traditional.  No frills or surprises.  What lacks in quality is made up for in quantity.  And don't be afraid to customize or specify preferences.  They are awesome with getting you exactly what you want.
Desserts often look better than they taste, unfortunately.  Most are quite dense and all are served cold.  Carrot Cake is always a win though and a cinnamon roll ONLY IF you eat it there, but be sure to order it warmed with extra icing.  Otherwise they are typically pretty dry.
Last, whether you dine-in or take-out, don't forget to ask for pickles, which are hommade and served with homemade pickled green tomatoes and sauerkraut.
Expect dinner to run $30 a head inclusive of t&t.<//text>

Great menu and awesome service. The French bread pizza with pepperoni was amazing. I could’ve just eaten a bunch of those for my entree. Fortunately I ordered the country fried steak and it was delicious and hearty. Big portion! I was pleasantly surprised. The fettuccine alfredo was bland and liquidy, not how it’s supposed to be at all and that was a huge portion as well. I wish we could’ve tried some dessert, but maybe we won’t fill up on silly entrees next time.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Bits of boiled meat in the veggies and bugs in the take-away box.

This place is only good if all you care about is large amounts of cheap food.  Servings are massive and inexpensive but of poor quality.  This place used to be great.  Last night I got the “steamed vegetables” because I thought it would be safe (I’ve lost confidence in the food prep quality) but when I started to eat them, they tasted like beef.  Then I found little grey bits of boiled meat all over everything.  Disgusting. No wonder they want to smoother everything in cheese and butter.  When I told the waitress she could have cared less and still charged me even though I sent it back.  Bad.  Then my son got a take-away box and there were BUGS in it.  Come on guys.  Last time we’ll ever go there.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Always enjoy a great meal. Waitress turned a negative into a positive as I awaited my bill and credit card return. She apologized and stated she had been sent to open another room which caused the delay. Appreciated her explanation and the meal was fantastic</review>

Visited this very fine Jewish Deli on numerous occasions.  Food is consistently excellent with exceedingly generous portions. Arrive after 4:00 P M ask for their early bird menu where very satisfying offerings are just $12.95! Cliff is hands down the most accommodating and gracious server in California!< /Review>

Staff is excellent... food is reasonably priced .. I eat here a lot , but unfortunately it’s usually after 7 pm .... because of this 75% of the time the vegetables are way over cooked and are inedible... they need to work on this .. I’m sure they were good at 4 pm</Review>

Service is usually good.

Give it a try. A tourist place for sure.

Great wait staff. Great food. Great selection. The menu was huge with options from cultures all over the world. The server noticed that a guests lasagna was a bit overcooked and took it back to redo with out hesitation. I didn't try any, but the cakes and pastries looked great as well. The prices were more than reason at about $15 a plate on average. My family and I had a great time here.</Text>

An acceptable deli with acceptable food. Nothing I have had was bad, but nothing made me say "wow"  either. Definitely worth mentioning that they serve very big sandwiches, much more that you would expect to get. What raises this place above a three star rating is the generous portions and the consistent professional service. I don't come here often, but I am usually not disappointed.<//text>

To be fair, not every item on the menu is a smash hit, but with such a huge menu it's not hard to find favorites that you want to eat time and time again.  The pastrami is fantastic.  And the carrot cake never lets you down.< /Text>< user_name>

Last month corned beef and pastrami were excellent as was the service.  Last night waiters were to busy talking in the kitchen to take orders.  At this visit corned beef and pastrami were very fatty and gristle.  Also kishka was burnt.  The burnt kishka was ordered as an appetizer and got there last.
Think we will try a different deli next time</Text>

This place fulfills my needs for a good pastrami or reuben sandwich. The French Drip with brisket is first rate. The patty melt is worth trying. The complimentary plate of pickles is usually fantastic. Service is paced well for visiting with friends, and that's the best thing to do here. Bring friends. Otherwise, it could be a bit slow. I've not had a problem.
You can make reservations. They join the mid century modern aesthetic with local sensibilities and the New York deli together perfectly.</Review>< pictures>

Our server was Luis; he answered our questions and helped us figure out what we wanted to choose from the huge variety of menu items. He was also very funny and extremely mindful of checking up on us and asking us how we were doing. The food came out quickly and it tasted spectacular! And as we were leaving, people wished us well and thanked us for coming. Very friendly staff, great food, and a wonderful restuarant.

And with Kim, the former Manager gone, it's not a good place to eat for many locals.  They opened a new store in Palm Desert and I think they put much more effort into that particular store.  Used to practically live at Manhattan, but now may go once every eight months.

<text>Interesting and tasty spins on a lot of standard favorites, like Huevos Rancheros. They add a stack of frizzled ham and cheese over the corn tortillas, then cover with sauce and eggs, along with the refried beans. Very enjoyable. Same twists go for their French Toast Monte Christo; so good! The menu has a broad selectiin. Be forewarned, portions are large. All the better to take a doggie bag for an later snack.

We ate there 4 times during our visit. Each time the food was served timely, by friendly and helpful servers, and was very tasty! We also partook of some of the bakery goods; also delicious! Their deli offers some hard to find delicacies. We loved their homemade pickled and sauerkraut.

They also feature interesting art works. Heard several customers inquiry after the work.

Only thing that kept me from giving five stars was I noticed the window sills next to the booths were in need of dusting.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is the best ! You will find their menu has such a wide variety, you will not have a problem finding a favorite, and in your price range.
The service here goes over and beyond, they even asked if we would like a drink to go,  pouring us a fresh drink in a to go cup.
Manhatten I'm the Desert will not disappoint !!<//Review>

My first visit-i really enjoyed it.  The commercial is accurate.  Food very tasty,  large portions,  reasonable prices,  and a bakery that is decadent.  Will definitely return.</Text>

I saw the ad on TV and not knowing what I wanted for dinner it was perfect timing. Quality food. Portions are as expected for a NY style deli. Staff needs to learn a bit more about the menu. A critical point was though the order was filled correctly, the order taker had the incorrect side on the receipt. If I did not hear the order filler say the wrong side, I would have been disappointed. I would eat here again.</text>

Dreadful meatloaf with baked potato and vegetables.
Meatloaf was over mixed and therefore tough
Baked potato not baked how can skin get crispy and inside your fluffy when wrapped in foil
Vegetables overcooked and goopy
Parking is easy and server was sprighly.
Not recommended</text>

Why are they so popular?  I've tried them a few times now and I just can't see it.  Compared to other places like Sherman's or It's a Deli they just don't compare on every level.  The staff is not very cordial, the seating is in terrible shape.  And yes I'm going to say it, cleanliness is always questionable, it never feels clean.  For me I just can't get past the fact that the floor/carpeting is so dirty your feet stick to it.  So my advice is if you venture in just don't look down......< /Text>

<text>Great food can be found there. The deserts are even better. The service is nice and friendly. I've not had to wait to be seated, though I do suggest that you call just incase there is seating available for when your like to dine, though more often than not you should be fine.</text>< time>

The reubens were really hard to eat , the crust areas on both sandwiches were as hard as a rock 1 inch in from the edge. Server said they might have double baked the rye bread.........WHAT!......Philly was pretty good,
$17 to $18 each sandwich with fries is not worth the fare that was served.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Great Food , really great prices on par with the superb quality of food you get.
The  star of the show was Armando who was our server, he treated every table as if they were family from the first one we saw him served until we left tonight. An All Star definitely for his company.</Review></record>

It was good food but, a little bit too pricey for the quality of food. I'll go back to try one of the deserts I saw behind the glass in the front waiting area cuz, the lunch bill was too much to include the dessert and I would love to have tried their carrot cake it looked sooo delicious</Text>

My parents have been coming here for years, bragging about the size of the food. Without using hyperbole, these are the biggest deli sandwiches in Palm Springs and the surrounding areas. The the bread is great and soaks up the meat nicely. The #39 is corned beef and pastrami, it is ridiculous. So good. The mish mash soup is incredible and the eclairs are to die for.<//Text>

Just got back from Palm Springs. This used to be my favorite restaurant. Service was great. Asked if we wanted drinks within 2 minutes of sitting down and the drinks were on the table in under 5 minutes. My wife had the steak sandwich which she said was excellent. 8 ounce Ribeye on a roll with fries. it looked good too.
I had the super combo Pastrami, Turkey and Corned Beef on Rye. All you could taste was the turkey but the worst part was the bread tasted like it had been thawed out in the Microwave. the center of the bread was ice cold and the rest was hard and dry like what happens when you microwave something 10 seconds too long. I have read that this place was starting to go cheap to keep the prices down but when you truly skip on quality and get caught..................I'll go elsewhere. I would say even though my wife loved her sandwich, mine was the worst sandwich I ever have had. I'll drive by next time.< /review>

This is my favorite restaurant in Palm Springs. When I'm lucky enough to be in Palm Springs, I have to stop at Manhattans. I've tried several items off the menu and I've never been let down. Go hungry tho, the portions are huge. And one tip, when you go, don't leave without a piece of carrot cake. Get it to go.<//Review>

I've been pleased here before yet the place is going downhill. 20 minutes to get our meal in a restaurant that's basically empty and the wait staff look miserable and seemed detached and inattentive. The little girls serving us look like she needed to be at High School mean girl class. The carpet has got so much grease and grime in it from 15 years of traffic. It's sad that this place is not doing so well. The food was okay<//Review>

Twice in a row now, dried out stale reading brisket and this time refried fries because I guess they been sitting around.  What ever happened to those great French buns?

Wow, great hot reuben. Little to no fat in meat. Probably the best I've ever had! Save room because dessert is the best in all of Palm Springs!</Review>

Fabulous!  Better bring your appetite!  The portions are unbelievable, and if you want a little to take home for later, there may be enough for one or two more meals.
Great All American, Jewish,  German and delightful bakery goods...oh, don't forget their wonderful coldslaw!< /text>

The food is not worth the price.  After three tries, I doubt I'll return if I have any say in the matter.

Update 1/20/20: the personal pizza is excellent.  I still am not impressed with the quality/price of the rest of the menu.</text>

<review>Great place. Went with my sister and my two children 4 and 8. They were really good with the kids and it was loud enough to where the kids didn't annoy anyone but not loud enough for it was annoying to adults. The pastrami sandwich was to die for not fatty and chewy but really good.< /review>< userid>

This review if for the Highway 111 location -  not the Palm Canyon (unfortunately, they don't appear to have their Google+ page set up for the Highway 111 venue as of yet).

Discovered this place by accident while driving down Hwy 111. Being a native New York, I of course noticed the word "Manhattan" right away and was intrigued by the prospects of "Manhattan in the Desert".  Stopped in with family for lunch and was not disappointed!  The decor is upscale casual with very comfortable booths.  Large black and white vintage prints of NY scenes hang on the walls.  The menu is huge! Took 10 minutes just to make a decision!  Decided to go with a classic Ham, Salami and Swiss sandwich on rye with side of potato salad.  The sandwich size matched the menu - again, huge!  Delicious.  Also, they have a bakery with assorted rugala and my favorite, huge black and white cookies!  Terrific place with friendly staff as was the manager, Itai was very friendly and grateful for our business.  Will be sure to visit again next time I'm in the desert!</review>

This is the second time we have eaten lunch in Manhattan in the Desert and the second time we were disappointed. This time around it appears the restaurant has been updated with new upholstery and some artwork but the quality if the food and taste remains unchanged, disappointing. The service was at best fair, no attention to customer needs or satisfaction and inattentive. Had to wave down a bussboy twice to get the waiters attention. The pastrami sandwich was way too fatty, I like the meat juicy and of course expect a little fat to keep it moist and most of all tasty, but this second visit produced the same disappointing lunch, tastless pastrami. There are two N.Y. type delis in the desert, as of now there is only one TRUE, New York deli (take it from this long time New Yorker who's eaten the real deal for thirty plus years) and that's Sherman's. I like the one located in Palm Desert better than the one in Palm Springs. We'll never give Manhattan another chance.</Text>

<Text>I was pleases to try this restaurant in the desert. They have a fun twist on horderves, PICKLES!

Maybe I just haven't been to a Kosher restaurant before, but it was a nice twist. I am learning that eating a little fermented foods before the meal- aid's in the digestion. So happy to get a great meal, nice service, plus a lagre display of beautiful desserts in the case- as we leave.

They do have non Kosher meats, for those looking for a ham sandwich or sausage.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><rating>4</rating></record>

<review>Anyone that says this is “like Manhattan” is out of their mind, AND insulting actual Manhattan. Staff was great but food was worse than IHOP. Potatoes looked liked they came out of a frozen 80’s breakfast. Hollandaise sauce was cold & eggs soggy. Don’t waste your money, PS must have a better diner than this.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80db1b5e237d70a9:0xb1511a3ddfe2297d<//GmapID></record>

A bit pricey for the basic quality of food, which is slightly better than most local restaurants of its kind. If you're not super hungry or not just craving deli food, I think there's more interesting local menus for similar $$$. And, sometimes the deli vibe isn't working at all for me even when the craving is strong, that's when I LOVE their #takeaway to eat at home.<//review>

I was visiting the area for the Easter Holiday.  I had the Hot Dog lunch--it was wonderful and wish we could have one in Denver.  I am hoping to visit the again, very soon and actually get a GC for someone who lives there.< /review>

<time>1518139901492<//time><Rate>1</Rate><text>When I walked in no one greeted me. I saw someone who looked like a Hostess and a server talking, whispering to each other, giggling. They did see me but they continued to talk amongst themselves. I stood there politely waiting and then they said, "oh are you with those other people just go over there". Then they went back to talking. When it was seated at the table with my friends a man who look like he could be a server or waiter waltzed in with an air of authority threw a stack of napkins down on the table and walked around looking us over did not announce himself great us welcome us or anything. In fact I really look like we were interrupting their day. My friends ordered their meal and or dessert and I wanted some soup. I looked at the choices of soup I did not want to eat meat there was a choice of chicken broth with different choices. I chose the chicken broth with the vegetables. The server stated the only vegetable that they could put in there was carrots. I said all right that would be fine. When my soup arrived it was lukewarm in temperature. The Taste was closer to slightly salted tap water really no flavor at all. And there were beautiful carrots floating in the lukewarm water. I told the server that did not want the soup as there was no flavor to it and it wasn't hot.  The soup was taken away immediately and I was not charged. Overall our group was happy with there desserts that they boxed up themselves. The only real good service that we received was from a delightful young man, it was the busboy. I definitely would never go there again and I would never recommend it to anyone.</text>< response>

Way overpriced. Walked in to get a simple deli sandwich to go.
15.00 .
Walked out. Went to Jensen's market in next parking lot and got one for 9.00$ made with premium deli meats and cheeses<//Review>

<Review>Truely Manhatten in the desert!  Shades of Katz's and the now defunct Carnegie with the addition of diner fare as well.  I asked for a small Pastrami dandwich, and still had to ask for two slices of rye bread to take half the Pastrami with us.  It took two of my cousins to finish it, with gusto.  Definitely worth your while to go out of your way to eat here!</Review></record></dataset><record>

It's just okay.  Deserts are not the best. Made with fake whipped cream. Food is huge portions with not-so-good ingredients. Nice dinning room and helpful staff.<//Review>

<text>Great meats and yummy sides, but the bread can be mediocre. Massive servings for the sandwiches ... But you certainly pay for it in terms of cost and limited included sides. Still, all in all, very good.< /text>< gmap_id>

Corn beef was so greasy and fat I complained to the waitress who was rude and said…..well corn beef is a fatty meat……perhaps I should direct her to a few GOOD places to eat.  Complained to the manager and he acted like they were doing me some kind of favor to even let me eat there.  To top things off I went home and vomited and  hugged the porcelain for 4 hours.  This place is a joke.  I am sure the Reviews must be written by relatives here.  They advertise on TV over and over again.  That should tell you how bad it is !!!!!  My advise,

<Text>Consistent good food, can get pricey- deli turkey sandwich w/cheese and steak fries  can push $20. Service is very inconsistent- sometimes good, sometimes horrible. Greeter (young, tall guy) is oblivious and very self-absorbed. Lose the attitude. Locals in the summer keep you in business.< /Text><userid>106705201467698437519</userid><date>1377218906060<//date><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>They were out of Baked Potatoes for the 5th time we have gone there last night as well as the special Prime Rib, it was only 7:30. I wonder how many times they been out of Baked Potatoes when we were not there !
This alone is one thing but we are a group that goes there several times a week and at least once a week 10 + strong, it was the attitude of the manager that really upset us, we walked out and will not go back., she could care less !

I can walk to the Manhattans in palm springs. As a deli addict I can tell you the food stacks up big time here at Manhattans. Soup..corned beef..pickles..its all here and all excellent.. I get my fix now 2x a week and all I can say is whew..its about time. Living up in Colorado with no deli for 8 years..pure torture. Now if they can just get that 7 layer cake down like I had when we were kids then we really would have deli here on earth....😍 from the professional palate of cheffrey.</Text>< Pictures>

the menu is rather larger than it should be.   the food is really mediocre.   the Napoleon had too much gelatin in the Bavarian cream.   it was like eating rubber.  I paid 699 for that thing!< /Text>
