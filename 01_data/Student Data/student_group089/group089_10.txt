<text>My little sister loves it here. The teachers are nice and the place is huge! What is cool about this place is that the gymnastics teachers seem to be at this place for a long time. Some of the places we go for gymnastics usually they have a new teacher every time they learn so sometimes they don’t know what certain kids have to work on or not.</text>< rating>

Overall great program no matter what your skill set or goal for the program whether it be to do competitive gymnastics or just build motor skill awareness/ burn off energy.  Clean facility and they are always organized for any program we sign up for.  The instructors and all staff are super friendly and take their jobs seriously.  We’ve been coming for over a year and plan to be here for many years to come!  My son Loves Coach David of the Ninja Kids program!!  As do we!< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>We have been coming for a 3 months now.  My daughter started in cartwheels and progressed into roundoffs after two months.  Coach Wes was very communicative and helpful with ideas for progressing and practice at home.  He sent weekly emails with feedback about class and videos for my daughter to watch.  He has an impressive background for coaching and it shows.  My daughter really liked him and learned quickly.  I like their policies and the positive atmosphere.  They also have a great viewing area for parents.</review>< Pictures>

I think that this gymnastics place is the BEST gymnastics place ever! I think this because it’s fun, exciting  and just super AWESOME! It’s fun because you get to do bunjes, trampoline, and you get to jump into the foam pit. The next reason that this is awesome because it’s exiting. For instance, you always get to do new things like back handsprings, and back and frount flips. The last reason why this place is the best place ever  because it’s just super, duper, duper, duper AWESOME.<//Review>

<Review>I moved my daughter over from the YMCA in Dec 2015 to join their competition team as a level 3 where she was very successful moving up the ranks with quality no nonsense instruction.  The Rec coaches are top notch but with any business I've seen changes the last year that's more focused on profit.  As a parent and an observer I would always recommend checking out other gyms before getting into a contract< /Review><Rate>4</Rate><time>1528656729261</time><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

<review>Both of my sons have been attending Gyminny Kids classes and camps for about a year, and we could not be happier! The staff and coaches are extremely helpful, and my boys just adore Mr. David. He is so kind, patient, and encouraging.  He always takes the time to give us a quick update after class, and I just love that. Being a part of this program has really given my son a lot of self confidence. Love this place!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Amazing for all ages boys and girls also available is camps and birthday party 🥳 with lots of activities available
The kids started at 2-3 years old at a beginner level and after some time your kids get evaluated to see if he can move to a level up
Very professional and high quality coaching available also personal training available
Easy to find parking not so easy</text>

Worst experience ever in 10 years working with a gym studio. This place is a complete racket~all they want is money. Let me preface that I have been very patient. I never leave a unflattering review unless it's warranted. My daughter has been at 3 different gyms in the last 10 years~SCATS, Eastside Gym and Mount SI gym and the lack of communication and coaches engagement at NCG is ridiculous. Not only do they not have enough classes available for their xcel prgram for the girls to succeed, but they still charge you for competitions when your girls don't go. For example, They just charged us $300 for a regionals competition in addition to the  approx $2400 in Xcel costs plus approx $300+ for monthly gym classes for absolutely no reason. Our daughter got a 34.70 in State and qualified, yet Coach Nathan decided she shouldn't go to regionals and regardless charged us the fee. It wasn't only her, also her best friend qualified at 34.025 and he wouldn't take her.

FYI- gold xcel qualifying is 34 for her age bracket.

What coach doesn’t take their girls( when others  are going anyway) when they qualify?  What does this teach them? Even if you are good enough, you should do better? Ridiculous. It’s hard enough in this fast moving and competitive day and age to feel your worth, let alone when you do what is expected to be told you aren’t good enough and can’t proceed. Why even compete or try?

WAY TO CRUSH YOUNG GIRLS SPIRTS and RUIN the last meets of the year NCG and Coach Nathan. In all my years (10) of coaches, never-ever-ever have I experienced worst customer service or lack of sensitivity to the gymnasts feelings. And Coach Nathan doesn't even stick around or talk with any parents. At least not in the last 3 gym meets I have been. Yes, I am upset. Mostly for my daughter who wanted the last year of xcel to be memorable. Now I am just mopping up their mess.<//Text>

Our family loves Gyminny Kids.  We joined about 1 year ago.  We were referred by Ronna.

Staff:  All staff members, especially Ronna, are super sweet and friendly.  They always greet my kids.  My daughter had Ms. Larissa and now has Mr. Earl.  She likes both teachers and I do too.  They are great with the kids.  My 4 year old daughter loves Gyminny Kids so much that she requested to have her 4th birthday party here last month in September.  Ronna kindly helped us with setting the arrangement up. The staff at the birthday party was great! We picked the princess theme.  Staff members that assisted us dressed up as princess/prince characters.  They decorated the room with table cloth, disney princess plates, disney princess center pieces, disney princess cups, and disney princess tiara.  They allowed me to bring my own decorations and cake as well.  I did bring some food too for the guest.  The party was 1 1/2 hours which I felt was perfect.  Parents enjoyed the birthday party because they had 1 hour to sit and enjoy other adults while watching their kids have fun with the staff.  Everything was executed well from greeting all guest at the birthday, getting the gifts, giving them name tags, putting them in groups, doing the activity for 1 hour, then leading the kids to the party room, and then leading them down to the front entrance once it was done.

Parking: there are plenty of spots in the parking lot.

Fee: it's pretty reasonable for the amount of fun my daughter has.

Environment/activities: they do so many activities that really allow the child to be engaged.  It assist with development and gross motor skills as well. The facility is big with a lot of equipment.  Staff members assist throughout the whole time in their class.  They have different themes every week where staff members dress up.  The facility is pretty clean and opened.  There are a lot of seats for the parent to watch the kids from the second floor deck.

I highly recommend this place.<//text>

Just a little thanks for staying open and serving not only a bunch of hungry SIP locals their favorite dinner, but also making hundreds of meals for frontline workers through this pandemic. Reinventing yourself to keep going through unimaginable times and always with a smile, Peter we so appreciate you and your delicious food. I look forward to being able to eating dinner out and having a Mangia Mi dinner with Butter Cake for dessert</Review>

Peter, the owner makes the lemon butter pound cake dessert daily...it's awesome! The wait staff is friendly. The food was a 4/5. The salad and desserts were definitely a 5/5. Will repeat!</Review>

< Review>
LOVE THIS PLACE!
I'm an Italian au pair currently living in the States and tonight I came here to have dinner with my host family. First time having dinner out since I got here.
I couldn't have had better night.
I had Gnocchi al Gorgonzola and gosh, those were delicious, almost tasted like home if it wasn't for the parmesan cause there was too much but I LOVED them!
Then I fell in love with the Buttercream Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream on top.
The kids didn't eat everything so we bought the leftovers home!

The staff was so nice and kind and we had so much fun talking with them!
Alexandria served us and she was amazing! This is the kind of staff I like to meet when I go to a restaurant.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US!
I'll definitely be back to have that buttercream cake again!😍< /Review>

I provided DJ services at Mangia Mi on July 9, 2019 and the food was very good, I'm not much for sweets and desert , but I highly recommended getting the Butter Cake! And the staff was very nice and accommodating.</Review>

<text>I was here for a holiday party, and the place was pretty good for that.  The food they brought out was all fairly tasty and if it's representative of the restaurant in general, it's good stuff.  The beer selection was small but well chosen.</text>< gmap_id>

It was good like always, the food is always good & fresh, I just wish they offered a little more vegetarian & vegan options,they do substitute out some items to some dishes. Their drinks are good to have with a meal, and the friendly family type service is the best!</Text>

< review>
A cute looking little house with seating on the porch and L-shaped patio, and more modern little restaurant (and kitchen) behind it.  So cute, it was my gf's and my choice for our first time in downtown Danville.  That means, it stood out above all others, and it was good to take our pooch since we could sit nicely outside on the patio.

However, we were put off by the lifeless hostess who clearly didn't like people and didn't want to be there.  Then, we sat at our table without acknowledgement for at least 5-7 minutes, until another gal with water didn't say hello and just went with the task at hand.  Finally, our server, was good but was 18 at best, and no fault of his, not mature.

The food was remarkably good.  We had the Lasagne di Carne [$21, 4.0 stars] -- a good portion, and very good Bolognese Sauce; Carni Suprema [$17, 4.5 stars] -- wonderful crust, but a little sparse with the toppings (Meatballs, Calabrese Sausage, Pepperoni) and a little small.  Still, very good and worthy.

So, in the end, won't likely return.  Food 8/10 and service 3/10.<//review>

< Review>
Had a reservation on Friday at 7 pm for party of four. We were seated by the owner at 7:35 pm with no apology for being that late. The service was good but the food was ok. If I get the average of everything, I will rate this restaurant 3 stars.</Review>

<text>As welcoming as home. Except the food is 10x better. I can’t get lasagna anywhere else other than Mangia Mi, it’s just not anywhere as good as here. Oh, the Calabrian Chilli Ravioli is also exceptional.< /text>< GmapID>

Great experience, Great food, Great service!!! I hosted a 50th Birthday party and this was the perfect place.  They have a private room that held 16 of us.  We were 16 women who were loud and didn't have to worry about disturbing anyone.  Our server Taylor was awesome!!! He was Very attentive, we didn't have to wait for drinks, appetizers or our main meal. Everything came out in a timely manner.

Some of my favorites were The burrata cheese or the bruschetta appetizer, The crab ravioli's, the pear Gorgonzola pizza, and their lasagna are all really good. For dessert, the lava cake.< /text>

The best lasagne I have ever had, by far.  The service was quite good and I found it impressive that the owner came by the table to check on things.</text>

I eat at Manga MI several times per year. I live on the east coast and come to Danville for business. Every meal we have eaten here is excellent. Service is friendly. This place has a great atmosphere. You see the kitchen and you smell your food being cooked. Last night I enjoyed the Crab Ravioli. My associate always gets the meat lasagna.< /text>

Some colleagues and I recently happened upon Mangia Mi while working in the Danville area. In short, our experience entailed a satisfying dinner with capable service. Sociable atmosphere, understated appetizers, and pleasant entrees.</review>

Love this store! Went in to browse and picked up a new game on a whim (and the suggestion of the staff). The game was every bit as wonderful as I was told, and I can tell it's going to be in heavy rotation for me for a while. Staff is super knowledgeable, friendly, and totally willing to help! I would give more stars if I could!<//Text>

I'm going to devise a training program specifically designed to help these members as they support the objective. With time, they will learn the important details covered in this example. 1 star implies there is room for improvement.<//text>

It's good place if you're looking for comics (obviously) magic, and D&D stuff! Such as guides and journals for your D&D campaigns!< /Review>

< review>
There is something I prefer about this place over the other Santa Cruz comic book store, I think it's the service.  They seem very knowledgeable and friendly.  They also carry games here making it one of the only"toy" type stores left in this city.  Cool comic store vibe reminds me of my childhood.</review>

John was most helpful. My boyfriend and I were happily overwhelmed by the number of new to us games, and John gave us an overview of each, as well as game nerd forum reviews, and shared personal experiences of the ones he had played. We chose two, and are quite happy with them. Thanks John.
Good experience. Will certainly be back.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The staff here is friendly and not condescending the way some geeky stores can be. Selection of new items and games is great. Personally I am into older back issues and they don't have the space for too much but they make up for it with their other offerings and their friendly demeanor.</review>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I'm give this store two stars because it is well stocked and it has a variety of books and everything anyone needs it was great to see   but   when my daughter and I walked into the store the gentleman behind the counter smiled at her and said hello and when I walked up behind her I also greeted him but he wasn't friendly towards me; I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead books and was excited to see the variety and up-to-date books he had but when I walked up to the register I found that he left the register to walk to the back to follow me on the store camera. I was surprised to see such blatant racism from a store that see's a variety of people everyday.  Those of you who had great experiences I'm happy for you as for myself I'll look for another store.<//review>< time>

< Review>
I've been to many comic shops large & small\old & new here and about a dozen other states,,,,,Gems like this shop are few and far between! I urge you to go to Troy with your questions,I've known him a long time,he knows a lot and will tell you the truth,                                                                                         Honestly do not let this store escape your attention!<//Review>

I love Comicopolis! I live a couple of hundred miles away so I don't get to visit as often as I'd like but you can bet I keep my comic book fund handy whenever I know I'm making a trip up the coast.
The store itself is super clean and organized, with the shelves jam packed with amazing books (and games!).
One of the owners, Troy (we haven't met the other one), is super friendly and welcoming as well as suuuper knowledgeable regarding all things comics. He always takes the time to help each and every customer find exactly what they're looking for and he always has awesome suggestions.

My partner and I have been loyal customers of comicopolis for 5 ish years now and have no intent to stop because we love giving our business to a shop that's owned by true comic book nerds who love what they do.

Keep up the good work guys!!< /text>

The Kadence folks have been very helpful during my mother's illness in this past year. If I have a question or need some equipment right away, they go out of their way to get it to us! I really appreciate that! THANK YOU and keep up that great caring! It's bad enough going through a family member's illness, so when you go out of your way to help us, you have no idea what a burden that lifts! Best, Pamela Peak</review>

<Review>I would have given them a 5 star, except I was advised, incorrectly, that I had to return my new Bi-Pap machine because I hadn’t used it for 30 days during the prescribed period. Fortunately for me and Kadence, one of their senior specialist realized that rule did not apply to me, since I was not a new user. Otherwise, Kadence really cares for their clients. Very prompt in reminding and sending you accessories & supplies for your machine every quarter or as permitted by your Insurance company.

I had Appria for 10 years and not once did they call or send supplies unless and until I called them. It was like pulling teeth from a live guerrilla!</Review>< user_id>

Kadence Healthcare was extremely responsive to my friend, Jerome Smith's, oxygen needs.  The Tech, Al, who came to the house explained the use of the equipment very carefully and made sure he understood how it all worked.  Al was very polite, professional and answered all of Jerome's questions.  Subsequently, telephone conversations with the Kadence staff have been helpful in further determining his needs and the type of equipment that he desires.  Overall, Jerome is quite pleased with the service and staff.  Thank you.<//Text>

<Text>I went to the Dr. In early February and was given a prescription for a new CPAP.  Kadence issues my last CPAP but for some reason had me running in circles to get a new one.. They were not aware they issues my last machine even though I had all my paperwork.. After 2 months of nothing I had no choice but to go purchase my own machine outside of my Insurance.. I even left several messages asking about renting a machine because I really needed it.. it would be a week before I got a call back. I would never recommend doing any kind of business with this company.</Text><userid>100056608560360897066</userid>< Rating>

If I could give them 0 stars I would. It’s been a month and I’ve been calling almost every day leaving messages. Never once got a call back. I tried to get a response by calling the sleep study center and they called a manager for me. But even THEN they still didn’t call me back.<//text>

When you call to end your service,  they give you a day but not a time. I called and waited every day for a week.  I rearranged my schedule every day and every day they did not show up.  I was on the auto pay.  Maybe they were trying to get more money out of me?

<Review>Not too often can I say I am truly satisfied with a company's customer service.Dana well exceeded all of my expectations.Dana arranged everything from all insurance matters and both sleep studies in just a couple of weeks.She brokered a deal with my insurance company which I thought would be impossible.She took care of everything arranged the speedy delivery of the equipment and educated me on the use of it. I highly recommend her and the others from Kadence Healthcare and Newport Sleep wellness Center.< /Review>< user_id>

<user_name>Nicholas Merkin< /user_name><Text>I would not recommend working with this provider.  My account representative (Michael) waited an entire month (from 1/6/17 to 2/6/17) to inform me that my insurance carrier had cut off coverage for a medical device that Kadence provided.  They sent me nothing in writing and failed to return my calls for a 17 day period, despite my leaving messages at least twice a week.  This placed me in a difficult situation with my insurance carrier that I now have to deal with.</Text><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Be sure to use this service if you do not care about your loved ones.
If you want to make sure that pesty mother in law, grandfather or spouse dies due to lack of oxygen. Lack of response, lack of compassion and lack of service, this is the place.
It's Monday 556pm. I myself, my doctors office, Hoag Hospital Irvine have tried to reach out for oxygen service for an empty container. I left 34 messages with the regular number, the after hours emergency number and the representative Eric (who promised great service).
I called 2 local suppliers on a SUNDAY, and they rushed right over with service and an extra tank to make me feel at ease. I was also given a top of the line oxygen concentrator for free. A 2500.00 freebie all because they were embarrassed and ashamed that Kadence called themselves "Healthcare".
Save your time, pick any other company.
It may save a life that you Love♡<//review>

< Review>
Placed an order with this company for a medical bed and side table.  I was told it would be delivered the following day and that the driver would contact us first thing in the morning with a eta.  The driver never called. After calling 4 times and being on hold for over an hour I was told that the driver forgot to pickup my order but would do so after he completed his route.  The drive finally arrives at 5:00pm without my complete order.  I ordered a deluxe bed with fitted sheets and side table.  The driver tells me sorry we don’t have the sheets or table.  No one from their company botherd to call and let me know of this issue.  After speaking the the manger Chris Foreman he told me will try to get the rest of my order in the next couple of days.  I asked why it took so long to findout you didn’t have my complete order since I paid for everting the day before and he gave an excuse that a lot of people ordered today so that’s why we have a shortage.
Why they didn’t pull my products that I have already paid for in full is beyond me, but when the manger acts like I’m lucky I have gotten anything delivered is terrible service.  Chris said he would bring out the other items when they come in “maybe a couple days”. So I am meant to sleep in the bed without sheets and not be able to eat dinner because their is no table.  And for all my trouble did they ever once say sorry or we will lower the price for you?  No
Stay away from this company.</Review>

My insurance (united Healthcare PPO) would like me to go through their in-network provider (Apria) to buy my CPAP machine and accessories. I had such a poor experience dealing with Apria that I decided to go with a out of network local provider and I have to tell you that was a great decision! After my very first interaction with Kadence, it was obvious that customer service is Kadence's #1 priority. They  patiently answered all my questions and educated me on different options (different masks, etc.). They even sent one of their therapist (Chris Rochin) to my home to setup the equipment and train me on how to use it!  Thank you Chris and Kadence for providing such high quality of service!</Review>

Horrible customer service. Called repeatedly over a three day period. Left messages calls never returned. Finally got someone and was transferred, but went right to voicemail!! On 4th day finally got someone to take my info. All I wanted was replacement mask and tube. The person I spoke to insisted I needed to have a Dr.'s perscription. Refused to listen to what I needed. Constantly spoke over me. Worst experience ever!!!<//review>

<Text>My experience with Kadence has been less than satisfactory. I have made 3-4 orders and none of them have arrived with the proper equipment.  I have a ResMed and was receiving equipment for another device.  The tubing, the filters, the water chamber, head gear replacement, no large size Wisp cushion. These items were all wrong. Adapter for the back of the machine not included. Consequently tubing split at the point of insertion into the machine. Package with headgear and Sm/M, L and XL cushion missing the L which is the size I use. I think that about covers it and gives you an idea of how I feel about your service,  Each time I ordered I noted to the person helping me that I was on a ResMed an did not know what kind of CPAP was indicted in my profile.  Supposedly each person corrected it but I guess not.<//Text><user_name>Joan Bates<//user_name>< date>

<review>During the pandemic, orders are made via drive-up/pick-up only, cash or check. Call first!

I ordered the moo shu pork, and was pleased with the large serving size and the quickness of service.< /review>< Date>

<review>Food came out relatively quick(5-10 min after ordering), but it wasn't cooked well. Ordered lemon chicken and Mongolian beef--both of them being undercooked and tough. I remember visiting 3-4 years back and it being a better place to eat back then. At the very least their steamed rice was fine.<//review>< rate>

The Fried Rice & Chow Mein are good, but the chow fun does not have taste at all. The noodle that was use in the chow fun are not for chow fun, it was more like rice noodles<//Text>

Sweet and sour pork was good. Chicken chow main was mostly noodles and no flavor. Egg rolls were oily. Vegetarian egg foo young was different, but tasty. Broccoli beef also had no flavor. Disappointed.< /text>

I really enjoy Lees, especially after TCM or acupuncture. They have vinegar and chili paste on the tables, offer chopsticks and tea, and the service is sensational. Many times I get to see parts of the family dining and interacting, which creates a beautiful and loving atmosphere. The hot and sour soup, pot stickers and ginger beef are all top notch.
I wish they would add some Korean side dishes. 🍚 🥢 🌊< /review>

<review>Only one good thing about the place – the service was nice. But the food was mostly bland.  The hot and spicy Mongolian beef was neither hot nor spicy.  The crispy chow mein noodles, an additional $2 charge, were dehydrated crouton strips you find in Chinese chicken salads.  It was not the expected pan fried noodles you get at other Chinese restaurants.  The hot & sour soup was basically salt water – inedible. They do not take any card…cash only! They have an ATM machine that will charge you a fee.  Also, they will automatically add a 20% tip (to the total tab including tax) for any party of five or more. This was not listed on the menu. Minimum is usually 6 for automatic tip.  We searched for reviews on this restaurant and found out that we were not the only ones who encountered similar experiences. It is disappointing to have this as our first meal at Fort Bragg.</review></record>

<Text>This place's delivery food tastes like someone described chinese food to a person who had never had chinese food before and hired them as a cook. Despite being cash only, the delivery guy conveniently didn't have any change and conveniently got a very large tip. I won't be back, I won't order again.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXP_iM2oBNpMBJ0-99BhkmC3wsIUOwz9euKMf7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

While searching for restaurants that delivered Lee’s Chinese popped up. If I had it to do over again I would definitely not order from them.  My opinion is based on food that was completely lacking flavor. It was very pricey and you don’t get the quantity or quality. It may have been a bad night for them, but the food was terrible and terribly expensive... I wouldn’t chance it again.</Text>

My two yr old accidentally broke a teapot lid and the white haired male owner came over and dramatically removed our dishes from our table exclaiming "these are NOT toys!!" As I was paying,  I asked if there was something wrong and the owner said "you broke something of MINE!" I said "I believe that's a wright off sir and I'm sorry and he jammed his fingers in his ears like 5 yrs old and said "Get out of my restaurant!!!! Blah, blah blah blah" while his daughter called the cops on me.

Wow.

That was incredible.

The food wasn't even that good.< /Review>

I gave it 3 stars because the food was really good. But, I think they forgot our order, since 6 families who come in after us received their orders before we did. And it was really expensive..what would cost us normally $25 -$30 at our home town, they charged us $85.<//Text>

<Review>Not sure how this place is still open. Our food was cold and extremely sticky. The water cups have a yellow film around it and I didn't even wanna drink the water. We went for a lunch special, but there was nothing special about it. Bland food, seems they've never heard of salt or seasoning. Im usually not a harsh critic and try to give the benefit of the doubt, but I will never eat here again. There are much better places to eat in Fort Bragg. Save your money and your time.<//Review>< response>

This is one of the best Chinese places I have ever experienced! All their food is always delicious and plenty to eat, not to mention the wonderful lunch specials. Do yourself a favor and eat here!< /text>

Nasty establishment. My husband said he did care for fried rice as it was just white with no flavor and the hostess got all hostel and asked us to leave. No can I remake or anything just told us to leave. I had one bite of food and it was HORRIBLE.  Should have not stayed once we smelled the stink in door.</text>

Worst chinese food ever!!!!!  Do not go there! I beg you!!  This place is a disgrace to Chinese food.  The sauces seem to be watered down, the chow mein was awful. Seems like its done with top ramen noodles. To top it all off they do not accept any kind of card in the restaurant, they make you use an ATM machine which also charges you a fee! Please avoid this horrid place.< /text>

Sat for 20 min before anyone noticed we had no order taken. Then food took forever to arrive, was cold, brown rice like glue. It was fairly busy, they kept apologizing, but service did not improve. Might give them one more chance, if we get desperate. Very disappointed, as we are moving into neighborhood & had high hopes.<//Text>

Food was great. Had no gooie rice or bland unseasoned foods. Excellent service. Tea was great. Absolutely loved it, the entire family was so happy with all food and service provided. Food was enough for 4 and even had some to take home. Prices are ok for what size you get.<//Text>

I'm not sure how you mess up steamed rice but it tasted like minute rice was left forgotten far too long on the stove. The crab balls (I hesitate to call them ragoons) tasted like the local Safeway was raided for crescent rolls and stuffed with off brand cream cheese. An hour after attempting to eat it I realized that perhaps if I salvaged it from the trash my dog might be intrested. Also cash only but somehow the delivery guy doesn't seem to have change so be prepared to give a large tip if you pay with $20 bills.<//text>

Below average quality food.  I've had better at the Safeway deli. And beware the $2.50 "extra plate" charge if you share a plate of food!  So...sweet waitress, terrible food, highly overpriced for the quantity you receive.</text>

You know how when you order Chinese food you don't worry about getting too much because you`ll want left overs?  I picked up some take out while in town to take home 45 miles away.   The house fried rice and the cashew chicken with all of their many different ingredients was so unfresh both dishes were just grey.   The only thing with color was scrambled eggs which led me to believe everything else was frozen at some point, probably to long based on the funny taste.
The fried prawns , which I always get at any Chinese restaurant with spicy mustard,  would have definitely been sent back if I were served them in house.  No where near fresh AND hard.
The Hunan beef was watery and tasteless.  Hmmm,  sounds like reheated frozen food to me.
Didn`t even try the house chow mien;  Same grey color.
Smelled great all the way home!   Didn`t finish what I put on my plate and threw the rest in the garbage.     $75 with 15% tip.  Saddened me because I noticed one of the original family girls still there.
I`ve never written a review where everything was terrible but it was.
I`d rather be writing a great review and dreaming about awesome leftovers.  No excuse for this disregard of quality control.
Sadly, never again.</Review>

please do not go there. the food is not cooked right and the owner acknowledges but just simply does not care. we've tried their food 4 times now because we just moved here and thought maybe it was a bad day kind of thing. but every time our chow main noodles came out so bland with no sauce and only 2 pieces of shrimp for $12. then the pork fried dinner tasted over powered with baking soda so bad we had to wash our mouths out with water. when we called after the 4th time to politely explain that our food now every time is so bad that maybe they should reconsider a different approach the owner said "listen sweetie! this is how we cook for other people if you don't like it go to the next town since there is no other Chinese restaurant."
i take it that the owner knows but just doesn't care. i can't imagine what else is going on behind close doors with that attitude. we are the kind of people that give chances because we know how hard it is to own a business. but this owner gives no care in it's authenticy of product or care in management. so you know the food purchase or the quality in cooking is going to be the same.</review>

The best part of this is the small-town, family-run aspect. The food is tasty and terrific, but the family who runs the joint is terrific!<//Review>

Called to order from the Super 8 after a 12 hour drive and no food since 8am.  My husband and I were exhausted and looking for a quick bite to eat before turning in.  The lady who answered the phone was rude and sarcastic.  After guessing what was in the menu (she offered no suggestions or online menu) she got my info and immediately said a harsh "Thanks" with no total or mention of a $7.95 delivery charge.  The food came fairly quickly seeing as how the restaurant is less than a mile away.  The young man said my total was $45 with me ordering orange chicken, general chicken, and crab Rangoon. He would not let me keep the receipt.  Our order was 1 pail of rice, 1 pail with the general chicken, a container that had mostly a bed of cabbage with some orange chicken, and 5 crab Rangoon's.  Extremely angry!!!<//text>

Food was a bit bland. The staff was friendly. Water shortage issues has them serving food on paper plates.
Just didn't have a lot of flavor like most Chinese food does.
Left me wanting...<//Review>

Culinary excellence shines through with perfection in the preparation of vegetables in the Kung pao and Mongolian beef we tried.  Best eggrolls ever--a solid 10.  The beef and chicken, though treated expertly, were not of the quality we expected.  Don't bother with the potstickers--doughy, underdone and bland.</Text>

<text>I frequent this outstanding restaurant once a month since I like the ambiance that is characterizes this restaurant. The crew is exceptionally welcoming and professional. The service is deeply rapid. Needless to say, the food they cook is exceptionaly good. I have been there often and I was always pleased. The price is honest. I highly suggest this place to all my friends.< /text>< pics>

<Review>This was my favorite take-out place for lunch when I worked in Carson for 10 years. They have the best barbeque pork, munggo, sisig, pancit, lumpia, pinakbet, and sinigang. Very affordable catering prices for potlucks. Get your food and go, cash only. You know it's legit when you see Filipino seniors eat here. I miss this place!</Review>< gmap_id>

This is one of my favorite locations to go to for lunch during the work week and back in junior high and high school this was one of my favorite places to go eat after practice.
I even got my whole office hooked on the barbeque sticks.
This is a great hole in the wall eatery and I recommend going in and giving them a try.
Deco could use an upgrade but food and service is excellent and affordable and portions are well worth it.< /Text>

Disgusting food, bathroom is abhorrent, food was cold, dry and very overpriced! If i saw the bathroom before I ordered there was no way I would have gotten food here. Health department needs to shut this place down!!!</Text>

Went in for lunch and ordered Beef Apritada and Pinakbet to dine in.  The Pinakbet was cold although it was in a heating tray. Apritada was good and flavorful along with the soup.<//Text>

This is the spot so close to my place double tree hotel . the food is the bomb if you like filipino food . just around the corner on carson street. The only downfall is they are closed on sundays.but check out all the other food places in the plaza see you there and enjoy ..<//text>

I'm half filipino and most don't think I look filipino and I do not speak tagolog. I have found that some filipino places kind of ignore me (and my siblings!) in favor of their obviously filipino customers. I called to make an order of lumpias for a pot luck (great choice, btw) and they hung up on me though they had answered in English. I had my grandma call right after and they took my order from her. I don't know if they didn't want to try to understand me or what but I guess I am used to the type of treatment from my filipino brethren until they see my last name (Macabuhay). And that has been my unfortunate experience EVEN with Delia's where I have eaten quite a bit. T^T

But the food is yummy.  (My grandma's is better though lol especially her pork and chicken adobo! Mmm)</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

Typical Pinoy "turo-turo" (point-point) cafeteria style establishment
Semi-reasonable prices
Clean & small dining area

Only had their BBQ pork on stick to go. Tasted fair.<//text>

Nice and fresh offerings in the UTC area. Always appreciated when a poke place offers tons of free topping that are really actually good ones. Fresh salmon and tuna are all I usually get and the imitation crab and misago really pull the bowl together. Highly recommended for lunch.< /Review>

<text>Love Poke UTC!  I've been there several times and enjoy it each and every time.  Good poke, good prices and only $1.50 for each extra scoop of fish!  I recommend a scoop (or two) unagi for desert.<//text>< user>

Good selection of toppings. Plenty of seating and good parking. This will satisfy your poke cravings but it's not the best. The Fish quality was good but not excellent.< /Text>

Been here 3 times, and they load it up. Right now get a bowl worth $10 or more and you get a free miso soup. I really like this place< /text>

<name>Adam France<//name><text>$17 and 2 oz of fish? Where is the flavor! I purchased the Poke bowl and added a 3rd scoop of fish. I had 7 bites of fish (small bites) total. They seem like they will do anything to not give you more fish. The sauce was ordered mild yet it was spicy. I am still hungry after eating this and after $17 for lunch I just will not eat here again. Avoid this place.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dc00cdb6273af5:0x28bbddc60cfc3be4</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Came here for lunch one day. Store has enough seating. Portion size is decent. The menu is okay. I think there shouldn't be an extra charge for the salad because most places don't charge extra for it. The avocado charge is fine, there seems to be a "shortage" of it in CA, must be too many ppl ordering avocado toast =P

The fish ingredients were soggy. The octopus is rubbery, which means it wasn't cooked properly. When I tried the brown rice, it was really dry. The place is close to a lot of apartments so I bet they get lots of customers that way but overall, it's okay. Definitely not the worst, just average.

The bowls  need to be larger to better accommodate the ability to mix the ingredients ourselves. Otherwise, a lot will just fall out. I am still on the hunt for an excellent poke place in SD.</review>

<Review>Miserable horrible place! It’s depressing just walking in! The owner is rude and cold and cheap cheap cheap! Someone else said the same thing- they try to give you as little as possible. When I asked for more of something, she acted like she was giving me more, but it was a FAME SCOOP over and over !!! I EAT LOTS OF POKE BOWLS all over san diego and this is THE ONE TO AVOID!!!

I love this place! The owner here is so nice and sweet. Once you're a regular, she'll give you free things like miso soup or bigger portions of fish. I don't know why they don't have more customers because it's amazing! They're clean, fast, cheap, nice/helpful and it's a great location.</review>

I haven't tried that much poke. Maybe three different places, but I'd have to say this is my favorite so far. I really like their sauce and they have radish as a topping, which I am a sucker for.

My favorite thing about them is their service, though. The woman who owns the place always has a sense of urgency about my order and always asks me how I am doing. You really feel special coming here, even though you're just getting a poke bowl. Bowl is very tasty as well, so you won't be disappointed.< /review>

I love this place! The owner here is so nice and sweet. Once you're a regular, she'll give you free things like miso soup or bigger portions of fish. I don't know why they don't have more customers because it's amazing! They're clean, fast, cheap, nice/helpful and it's a great location.< /Text>

I haven't tried that much poke. Maybe three different places, but I'd have to say this is my favorite so far. I really like their sauce and they have radish as a topping, which I am a sucker for.

My favorite thing about them is their service, though. The woman who owns the place always has a sense of urgency about my order and always asks me how I am doing. You really feel special coming here, even though you're just getting a poke bowl. Bowl is very tasty as well, so you won't be disappointed.</text>

<review>Interesting smell upon entering.

Food was tasty, plenty of fish in each dish.
Poke is becoming a popular food trend. While this place does it well, I've had much better.< /review><user_name>Elliott Park<//user_name><pics>None</pics><userid>108935866402638410726< /userid><date>1477078169128< /date>< resp>

Kazanori is a super solid poke spot in Westfield UTC!! It's kinda tucked away in the corner next to Rubio'a so it can be a little easy to miss.

They offer a good amount of option for protein and many of them are already marinated! I tried two scoops of the crunchy garlic tuna and the salmon and liked both a lot! I also got masago, seaweed salad, carrots and edamame. The veggies are pretty low frills and you can expect all the usual toppings. The spicy aioli was really yummy and comparable to spicy mayo! Really brought the whole bowl together for me.

UTC is annoying now and only has 2 free hours of parking so shopping and eating is a little tough if you're trying to stay in that window. Kazanori makes it a little easier though by providing quick and friendly service!<//Review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>It's my first time getting a poke bowl. This Hawaiian dish is pretty much a tasty sashimi bowl. Poke UTC is another fast casual restaurant. You start off picking your base: white rice, brown rice, chips, or salad. Then you get 2 scoops of raw fish (salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, yellowtail, scallops) and pick what you want mixed in (imitation crab, cucumber, white onion; avocado and seaweed salad are extra cost). Finish it off with your sauce (poke sauce, spicy mayo, ponzu) and toppings (cilantro, green onions, sesame seeds, etc).

For my bowl, I chose salmon, tuna, avocado, white onions, cilantro, and green onions. I went with the spicy mayo because that's what the employee recommended. The scallops didn't look very fresh. The quality of the fish was alright, but my bowl as a whole was enjoyable. I'm a huge fan of salmon so this is my kind of dish. It was a filling meal for a $10 meal. I wish we had some poke shops here in DC, MD, VA.

Service was friendly and helpful. If you're a first timer, they'll explain the process to you.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Fish isn't super great quality, but poke is overall satisfying! Can get a bit expensive if you add avocado and seaweed salad and an extra scoop of fish.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>You ever had a bagel in NYC? Then you know what we have on the west coast is training wheels compared to them. Well the same can be said about most San Diego poke, it's good-ish, but is B Squad compared to the real stuff.

Poke, oh poke, how when in Hawaii you are so delicious and tasty, but her in California you are a new genre of food I call Chipoke. The build your own bowl style like they do at chipotle. It's not that this is "authentic", but the hot calrose rise. Of all the poke at family parties, never once was it served over rice. It's really more of a side dish, but yeah if you want to make it into a meal, by all means put some rice on it, just use the right rice. I'm pretty sure the Japanese restaurants get this right by using sushi rice. Brown rice, of course California, of course. Salad, of course California. My poke salad's at most Japanese restaurants are frugal with the salad, it's not even a base or the main ingredient, so easy guys.

Décor, blah, strip mall in La Jolla's University City. About has Hawaii as the Mai Tai you get at TGIF, not UTC like the name states, so don't go to the mall and think it's in the food court. Should be called Poke University City. Service is quite good, friendly fast, very consistent in portions. Not much in the way of competition, so their pricing is questionable. Even with extra free accoutrements the small is not very filling. The sauces are pretty mild, top to bottom. I like the liberal use of sesame seeds, but not the overuse of green onions. I dig the mac salad, something missing from most places and the daikon, excellent offerings. The fish is fresh, firm. The dishes turn out good looking, but to me taste should not be sacrificed for appearance. My tastebuds and stomach don't see pretty like in all the pics with the vibrant colors and good lighting.

Some ingredients are extra like Avo and seaweed salad. If I'm eating rice with my fish I'm trying to be healthy, and part of that is the ratio, don't overload the bowl with rice and pile the fish on top making it look like it's overflowing. I'd rather have a sensible ratio of fish to rice and even accoutrements to rice and fish. The sauces have to be better, more bold, they have to use more and it has to coat things better.

I work in a deadzone for poke and burgers and Mexican food and half of what I used to eat weekly, so I'm severely disappointed when I get mediocre food driving all the way from Carmel Valley. Most of San Diego, heck Southern California poke has let me down in someway, this more than others. i gave an extra star because of consistency, but this makes me miss Hawaii.</review>< Pictures>

Best Hawaiian BBQ place I have found in San Dimas. Macaroni could use some apple cider vinegar and sweet relish, as is a little plain, but that is just me. Bbq beef sandwich was okay, needs to be on a different bun. Bbq beef and chicken are good, rice and steamed veggies are outstanding, best I have had in area. Will be certain to come back again soon. Staff are very friendly. Dedicated parking, everything accessible.< /text>

The food is made fresh to order and is large portions. The orange chicken with brown rice was amazing. They are very friendly, polite and helpful. The restaurant is extremely clean. As soon as people left, the tables were cleaned. I reccomend  this restaurant.<//review>

Small but Asian Hawaiian fusion works well. Still working my way through the menu but is definitely recommend this place. Originally discovered by delivery it's been a request by my daughter; one of the few vegetables she'll eat, the braised string beans are her favorite.<//Review>

Love the food here. They're chow mein is my favorite chow mein to get. Highly recommend getting it, especially the house chow mein. (Has shrimp, beef, and chicken as well as veggies.) They give you a big portion as well. They also have really great musubi, and as far as I know, it's the only place to get it here in San Dimas.

I'm taking a guess the woman that's usually at front in the evenings is the owner. She's very nice and friendly.<//Text>

Exellent customer service. Alex is very professional and knowledgeable when it comes to explaining his products. I really love the scale they have in their store It prints out how much weight and body fat you have. They also have good quality gym wear. Definitely recommend shopping at Pure Nutrition.</text>

Shopped here in hopes for better selection of products. Sylvester helped me in what I was looking for in supplements. Very knowledgeable and knew his products. Wasn't rushed in buying anything. I'd highly recommend shopping here for your needs, they have everything in stock you'll need. Also, thanks for the hookup on the CBD sleep aids! I'll be back for a bottle or two!< /Text>

<Text>I would highly recommend this shop owned by two brothers super nice and helpful. I first came in ready to just buy a product but the owner recommended I first try the product and if I liked it to come back and purchase it. Not pushy at all super genuinely cares about his customer's. I give this place 5 stars only because I can't put 10 stars. Awesome experience I will be back. Thank you for your help.< /Text>< pictures>

Amazing staff that has a wide selection of items for purchase. They are honest and wanted to make sure you fulfill your needs related to the store. High standards to set and they sell some food to by a meal prep vendor. Loving being treated well by them.<//review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>I always come here. Everyone is educated in all their products, so if your not sure about something they are always glad to inform you on the product in question. Most places when talking about a product will mention the what stimulants the product will have but here if they mention anything they will explain to you what it is and what it does, rather than just saying it to make a sale. Highly recommend especially if your just beginning to work out, they will guide you along the right path.</review>< pics>

All the owners and staff are very well educated and knowledgeable with the products, workouts tips and overall health. Everybody is so happy and excited to help customers and I have never had a bad experience. And to make it even better the prices are much lower (for a higher quality product) compared to other supplement shops.</review>< pics>

It has stevia for sweetening so I could stay away from the unhealthy sweeteners additives.  Plus, I just got a shock from the Dr's office that my lab work showed vitamin D deficiency. They have what is needed to correct this and placed a plan of action to help get this right and next lab in 3 mos. I will be 'righted'. The guys there are personable and caring.💜<//review></record></dataset><record>

This is an awesome store! They have good deals, knowledgable workers, and really cool gym clothes. This is my favorite nutrition store. It definitely beats the big commercialized stores like Vitamin Shop or Nutrishop.<//review>

< Review>
Nice small restaurant in a nice small town. Easy to locate & find parking. I ordered the falafel wrap & a side of fries for 2 people. There was plenty of food for a meal & there were fries leftover for later. Everything was served hot and fresh and tasted delicious. The falafel wrap had the perfect assortment of flavors and the right amount of each ingredient. Good customer service, too. Would definitely visit again.<//Review>

Love their sandwiches... Very flavourful. Pretty authentic in their use of spices and cooking style.<//Text>

We stopped by here to pick up dinner after a day at Poplar Beach. It was SO GOOD! The sizes of our meals were definitely worth the average $14 price for entree style meals. And their baklava was so delicious and flaky but also sweet and dense. Oh my gosh, please get the baklava while you're there.

We got the kefta wrap and a combo appetizer plate and it was so good that I barely got photos. Combo appetizer plate had hummus, baba ganoush, dolma, and falafel. All of it was delicious and I cannot recommend this place enough. Definitely going to stop here again anytime we visit Poplar Beach!</text>

Had the lamb kebab and my wife the falafel. The lamb was not freshly cooked. It was precooked & totally over done. The falafel was very dry, came with no sauce.
Even it were excellent, the price was way too high.
I will never return!<//text>

My fiancee and I ordered the chicken schawarma wraps and falafel balls. Let me just tell you, I've had this same order from a lot of restaurants in the bay area. The way they prepare their chicken... is unreal its so good. We live far away but will travel to half moon bay to eat here again. Please support this local business during these trying times you won't be disappointed.< /Review>

I feel like this is such an underrated spot, possibly because it’s still new? The food is seriously so delicious and the portion sizes are great. Everything is pretty affordable and there’s a variety of great options on the menu. So far I’ve had their falafel, hummus, baba ghanoush, fries, and kefta and have been extremely impressed. Everything tastes authentic and fresh. I highly recommend checking this spot out if you’re in the area! Grab some food to go, then hit the beach nearby!</Review>

Amazing owner! Helpful and accommodating. I wanted a chicken and beef over rice and he got that made! Gave extra sauce too! Delicious food! Fantastic options for vegans such as falafels and grape leaves. Vegetarians can have baba ganoush. Fresh food!<//text>

Underwhelmed at overall such high ratings. Prices are quite steep for fast food middle eastern (six dollars for packaged frozen French fries, 14 dollar for meat wrap).Location is in an older strip mall. Staff is polite. Falafel balls were okay. Shawarma meat was not cooked on a split or rotisserie and tasted oily and and is served with iceberg lettuce. Not sure what the alternatives are at half moon bay.</text>

<Review>We just got food from there and it's not as good as it's described in the other reviews.

The prices are also too high for such low quality.

Noticed that the shawarma is not done on the traditional skewer oven; it's like taco style.<//Review>< pics>

Stumbled across this place. Glad we did - tried their chicken Shawarmas (the friendly staff there made them spicey at our request) and they were delicious - yum! Wish we had tried other things as well.< /text>

A True taste of Mediterranean Food, after trying the food here it will be hard to like the food at any other place !!
The taste of their Shawrma is heavenly and the Falafel is absolutely AMAZING!
It's a family business operated and managed by four brothers who obviously put</Text>

Love this place! The baba ganoush is so smoky and delicious. The dolmas are to die for. And I can't get enough of their chicken kebabs and shwarma.
I usually order for pick up. In fact, I am going right now to pick up some lunch.< /Review>

Delicious food, really nice people, very reasonable prices. We went there once for lunch and kept coming back. They also catered a very nice lunch for us and everyone was raving about the food. HMB Kebab is a winner!< /text>

<review>A favorite for decades between my friends and I. The dishes are tasty, good portions, average prices for a specialty restaurant. They increased their outdoor seating area by taking up the parking spaces that used to be there in front. This has worked in their favor, not only for socially distancing, but also in getting further away from the stench of the cigar place.
As always, the servers are kind, attentive, helpful.
Felix's has definitely earned its reputation for great food.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>This place has a lot of good people who served the customer. They make sure you’re satisfied with the food and the service. They have pretty good deal with the food. If you select the meal, it comes with appetizer and dessert. And the price just incredible inexpensive. . . Since the pandemic, they just serve outdoor dining. But do not worry, at night, they set up the table with heater too...< /Review>< pics>

Though the price is not that affordable, it's all worth it for the yummiest food they served. The quality of the food and refreshing drinks are world-class. The service is also outstanding. You won’t be disappointed with this restaurant. I can't wait to visit here again. Highly recommended!</review>

We ordered their best-selling food, and when we found it wonderful, we were so pleased. Our experience at your restaurant will never be forgotten.

It was an amazing experience, and the food was to die for! After arriving earlier than my reservation, it was a good feeling that the restaurant had seats available upon my arrival. Not to mention, the food was great. I cannot wait to return to this restaurant with my parents, so they can experience the restaurant's greatness!< /review>

<text>I love this place. I have been going to it since 19 88. The service is excellent, attentive but not intrusive. Quick delivery and your iced tea does not get more than half empty.

Pollo Criollo is perfectly seasoned and exquisitely tasting.  It is the height of compliment to have that excellence and consistency for that many decades. The first taste brought tears of memory back to my eyes. We used to go for work lunches from TRW to enjoy some fresh air around the Orange traffic circle. About back memories of wonderful times with wonderful people. As I gazed around the patio, that phenomenon and magic still occurs.<//text></record>

<Review>Having been to Cuba, the food at Felix is authentically Cuban. The service was super fast. We ate inside, where the atmosphere is nice enough but pretty basic -- you are not in a trendy new place. There are sidewalk tables as well, and since Felix is on the circle, they are pleasant (and were fully occupied). We will be back.< /Review>< pictures>

Love felix's. Be sure to get the salad with their home made ranch-its amazing! Get the combi with the entree, salad and dessert..lots of food for about 20 bucks. All the food excellent but my go to dinner is the chicken supreme< /review>

<Text>I used to have lentil soup and black pudding salad. Artisan bread with broth is stronger than sliced bread. The egg yolk with the black pudding will be softer. The staff are attentive and the restaurant is lovely, I'll certainly be back, it can be hard to find good soups and salads, particularly at an affordable price!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I ordered food to go.
There were only 4 skinny yucca fries fir my order, they looked like McDonalds French Fries and the Levon was tasteless. I actually threw it away. It tasted like it was boiled .
The last time I got food to go , the fried pork as super dry.
I won’t ever get food to go again. I am very disappointed after going there since 1998.</text>

Not to mention the food's delectability. I ordered the sticky honey shrimp with garlic butter, which was tasty. I'm certain I'll be back! We decided to stop for dinner at this restaurant because my mother was visiting and staying in the neighborhood for the evening. We were seated immediately, and the service was excellent.< /Text>

That Cuban sandwich was SPECTACULAR. I’ve never tasted anything like it. The roasted pork is otherworldly in flavor, with a light peppery /cumin(?) tasty crust. Generous portion, delicious home special salad dressing. Must have!</Text>

It has been a while since I've eaten here.  I had the chicken a la orange,my husband the roasted pork. Mine was good but the sauce was cold and coagulated. My husband's was excellent. The beans were also very good. His plate had white rice, mine had yellow, which I'm thinking perhaps had saffron. The plantains were really delicious. Mine also had a onion side. I'm not really sure what else was in it but it was good with the chicken. The onions were crunchy but not overpowering. The service was good. Forgot, I got a piece of tres leche to go. I  wish they whipped there own cream,  it has completely melted by the time I got to eat it, otherwise it was very good, albeit very small.  Overall it was very good and I would recommend it.</Text>

Awesome. Cuban Spanish food is my favorite. The empanadas were crisp, over stuffed and delicious. The flan was so creamy yet that burnt caramel coating makes it a match made in.heaven.</Text>

Felix Cafe always has some of the best tasting chicken in my opinion. I love this place for beans and rice. They have good appetizers as well. Outdoor seating and a cigar shop if you're into that. They have some killer 3 leches cake. Very tasty!< /Review>

What a nice restaurant in the area! The poolside common areas are great with chairs and umbrellas for free. Also, the servers are very professional to provide whatever you like from their cafe menu. The place was also very cleaned and organized. A strong recommendation for your wonderful service! What a nice place, guys!</Text>

<Text>Right in the heart of old town orange and close to Chapman university. It's in the round about. Parking might be difficult since its really happening place. The dining space isnt that big but the taste makes up for the space restriction. The ox tail was terrific and so was the flan. The portions were plenty as well.< /Text>< Pics>

We got Caribbean Delight, it had fish, calamari, scallops and shrimp.  Also plantains and rice.  It came with fish soup and bread pudding for dessert... so good.  The plate was scraped clean!  Also the coconut shrimp for appetizer, so crispy and fresh.  You have to get the sangria, a beautiful deep red with blackberries.  The best sangria I have ever had.</Text><userid>100036312669048128105< /userid>< GmapID>

I always have a great time at Felix Cafe. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They also serve pretty big portions as well so eating there is bound to give you another meal in leftovers. I have been here many times and seem to always get the Felix combination. I love this dish as it mixes chicken, beef, pork, and fish with some rice and bell pepper and onion. It seems to have a mix of everything and is very delicious. I definitely recommend Felix.<//review>

Went to Feliz tonight to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. Our first date was here so this place is special to us. The menu is great,  Cuban with Caribbean flavors and enough food for even the  hungriest connoisseur. The service was very friendly and very respectful. This place will always be part of our story.< /Text>

One of the oldest places in the circle and still one of the best. I'll never pass up a chance to get their paella or their empanadas. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the generous portions, with that huge bowl of paella being enough to feed two very hungry people with ease for under $15.< /review>

<Review>Always a family favorite. Felix is our go to for Cuban food in Orange County. Everything is scratch made, flavorful, and with excellent proportions. Absolutely to try are the Ropa Vieja, Rabo Encendidio, Tres Leches, Roasted Pork, Arroz con Pollo, and the Cuban Sandwich, Steak a la Cubans are all must-haves! delicious<//Review>< user>

1 Star meal: not even the manager, after issuing me a full refund, could tell me what this menu item was (no.9). Served warn, not hot. And bland, oh my was it bland.

1 Star service: I believe our server was given too many tables to serve. The result being I felt rushed, not heard, and in the end forgotten.

1 Star management: I had to come back twice to receive a refund. The first time I asked for a refund, the person in charge said I needed come back to speak with someone else.

When I came back the next day to see that person, to my dismay, the servers pointed out that same person I spoke with the other day. They said the guy I'm looking for is the one wearing the red shirt, sitting in the circle of men smoking cigars. Yep, it was the same guy from the day before. The same guy who told me I needed to speak to someone else. Well, he walked me back to the restaurant and gave me a refund.

I believe, depending on what day you go, what time of day or night you go, who is cooking that day or night, and how busy they are will determine the quality of the meal and level of service you will receive. Hence the wide range of reviewing experiences, all of which I believe true.<//Text>

I ordered take-out during Covid to satisfy my craving for cuban food and was amazed at the quality and depth of flavor of the food. Not to mention the sheer volume of food for the price. The picadillo was outstanding as was the fish soup. Can't wait to go back.<//Text>

Had to wait for the simple things we had to request like drinks, napkins and bill. Which took forever to get him to bring to us. I asked the waiter to get clarification if my meal came with a dessert. As I needed to request it to go since it took so long for him to get order. He said "we would talk about it after he delivered the food". I then waited.... food served and he was not to be seen until the bill to be paid. O Asked him again and he said yes the I could go inside to get. I said for him to bring me it back in a Togo. It took him forever to do so! Then I received the included dessert... it was a postage stamp size piece of cake. Really one bit if that! He was taking so long to service one of the people in Our group went to buy a cigar... he left the bill on the table after giving to waiter his credit card. The waiter came over and said that he needed the signature. We said sorry he will be right back he is buy a cigar in the shop next door. The waiter told me to sign for him. I said I can not do that for him. He kept asking for signature. Then notice in bill it said NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED it was printed right on the bill he was trying to get me to sign! Fantastic food awful service! Still would recommend going. They just need to hire someone more customer service orientated!<//Text><Name>Carrie Lear< /Name>< user>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Date>1601177262452< /Date><Review>This place use to be good and i have been disappointed the last 3 times ive gone. The Frita use to be excellent many years ago but its not any more. The meat is different. They use to serve it with a hand made patty but not anymore. The garbanzo beans were hard and the server said that's the way they are, but I don't think so. They were undercooked and were only luke warm. The ranch salad dressing was plain and taste like nothing,  so i guess they are trying to save on cost there too. We asked for napkins and never received them and couldn't even get the server back to ask for condiments. This will definitely be the last time going back.<//Review><username>Dennis Rodriguez<//username>< gmap_id>

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Orange Circle. Before all of the new fancy eateries went in, there was Felix’s. They have been serving Cuban food for quite awhile. Delicious food that is different and a nice change of pace. I love the Pollo Criollo that comes with yummy black beans, white rice, and plantains. So good! Simple and fresh. They give you plenty of bread and butter to enjoy with your meal. The flan is absolutely wonderful. This is a great restaurant to sit outside on their nice patio and enjoy the beautiful historic Orange Circle.  Location and food are awesome. I highly recommend Felix’s Continental Cafe.</Text>

I wish I had remembered to take pictures because the food here was beautiful and delicious. I had never had real Cuban food before, I am Colombian and the food is not that similar. Great place to go get something healthy. They have paella which is also Colombian: yellow rice mixed with some seafood and vegetables. The thing I got was chicken with shrimp with sauce with avocado slices on top and it was delicious. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Even though we got their kind of late they let us hang out and eat while they cleaned up. Very friendly place highly recommended. I added a pic of the cool Latin-looking Starbucks next door.< /text>

<Review>The quantity of food was surprising. One dish could have fed two of hungry me (I weigh about 130 lbs). In fact, I brought home the left overs and ate it over two meals. The staff was friendly. I would love to come here again.<//Review>< name>

The musics was too loud! The service was friendly but the kitchen was slow. We ordered a little bit of everything . The only thing I can say that was great was the corn on the cob, everything else needed more flavor. I would suggest using better rice for the Moro. Not a fan of this spot.< /Text>

Been coming here for years when in Orange. Food is always great and prices reasonable. So many great entrees and sandwiches to choose from. Everyone in the family has their favorite--Aporreada de Ternera (Ropa Vieja), Steak a la Cubana, Felix Sandwich (beef and onions on a baguette), Roasted Pork, and Chicken ala Orange--all highly recommended. Tasty sides of creamed spinach, maduros, tostones, and a host of great appetizers. Yum!</text>

Pork was so dry and it tasted like it was put in the microwave 5 times. I can't imagine that is what quality Cuban food taste like. The Italian dressing tasted like pure garlic sauce. The rice, beans, plantains were good. Was looking forward to eating here. Owell.< /review>

Felix Continental Café offers an amazing breakfast, brunch and dinner. I've dined here twice for breakfast outdoors. The staff is very attentive. Last visit I had the salmon medallions, a piece of breakfast burrito and pancakes. Everything was delicious. Orange juice is fresh squeezed. Dogs ordered a side of ham and are welcome on the patio. I've also had dinner here with satisfying portions to go. Recommend dining here for any time of day. Great spot.<//text>

This place was recommended to us on a business trip and it's one of the best meals we have had on all of our travels. The brussel sprouts were the best we've had anywhere (and we tend to eat a lot of brussel sprouts). The atmosphere was a little more upscale than your typical restaurant and the menu selection was great (aka we wouldn't bring our kids along).< /text>

Best Caribbean food in SD!! If you think otherwise inform me. I've had everything from the oxtail, goat to chicken and they never disappoint. Granted some comes off the bone better than others some days. They get busy so I'm guessing the rush is the difference. Better to call ahead and place an order if you don't have time to wait.< /Review>

Food quality was poor for us as we dined first service on a Friday night.

Just a thought...when your food is starting to turn bad, throw it away. Don't put it on my plate then charge me full price for it!</text>

< Review>
I have tried many dishes there from the chicken tot he roast pork, from the fish to the Cuban and Caribbean chicken varieties plus the great service, reasonable prices and the friendly atmosphere as desert is included with mode orders. People watching is fun as they come from 4 corners of the world. If you haven't dined in Cuba, then you cannot objectively review Felix's. The cuisine at Felix's is exceptional and rivals any restaurant in Cuba. The menu is extensive with desert included in many of the moderately priced meals.<//Review>

<Text>Excellent food. I truly recommend anyone to come and check it out. My family and I have been coming here since 1997 and still the taste and the customer service is above and  beyond... I still see almost all the old faces... Absolutely unforgettable place.

I've been coming here sporadically for years with my wife.  They have a good selection on the menu and the prices are very reasonable.  Last week I had pork chops and my wife had chicken.  Both included salad, bread, beans, rice, dessert, and of course the fried plantains.<//Text>

Stopped by here a couple of months ago after a bit of drinking. I can't remember much about the experience except 1) it smells real, real bad, and 2) the food was incredible and well worth sitting in what smelled like a giant cat box.</review>

The Felix Continental Cafe was absolutely fantastic, the Felix Continental Cafe was delicious and the wings were the best I have ever had. This traditional Caribbean restaurant has an open kitchen where you can watch the owner/chef prepare each dish with care. Definitely going back. Its a short walk from Orange.<//Review>

Big portions. Free bread. Delicious food. I crave it! My favorite is the Oxtail entree but I've ordered just the rice, beans, and maduros on occasion for a simple, hearty meal. All the small plates/appetizers are fantastic too. Don't even get me started on dessert... I have tried them all and loved them.. rice pudding especially. You gotta try this place out!<//Text>

Had the Salad with Tuna Salad and fruit and it was amazing.  Friends had some sort of burger and everything was awesome.  I have been going to Felix's since the late 1970s.  Always great food and service and it was so nice to sit outside this afternoon.< /Text>

The roasted pork with rice,black beans and fried platanos was very tender and tasty. And the prices were reasonable considering the popular location.</Text>

My daughter and son-in-law took me here for brunch on Fathers' Day. My daughter wanted to take me here after she dined here with her family on Mothers' Day. We sat outside in the cafe seating which was very pleasant. But it was the food that I'm here to rave about. I had the Crepes Supreme which was delicious! As for the service, it was friendly, timely and attentive. I'd recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

<Text>40 years on, this place still is on their A game. Delicious Cuban dishes. A little pricey, but in line with the iconic location at the Circle in Orange. Park in the lot to the Southwest of the restaurant, then walk through the alley to Main St, then half a block north.<//Text>< pics>

Felix's is a great place with a great authentic cuban atmosphere. The staff is always so friendly and inviting. This place compares to (if not better than) Versailles, the famous cuban cuisine restaurant in both Miami and LA.<//Text>

There's not too much of a weight food comes out pretty fast food is excellent service is great places clean restaurants could use a little work but its small restaurant so what can we say.

Great food, great prices, and beautiful location in the Orange Circle. I miss the food here! Whenever I'm back in my hometown I eat at this gem. Feels like someone's grandma is cooking in the kitchen. Yum!
Juan was our awesome server, and I can't believe he always remembers us! He is the best and has been there as long as I can remember.
Food is so good, we ordered extra to take home with us.< /Review>

Just a heads up, there is a cigar store next door, and people will smoke out there, so you'll want to eat inside. We have never had to wait for a table inside, even when it's relatively busy. The portions are hefty enough for my wife and I to split a plate (we like the Sailor's Seafood Casserole). Delicious.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Excellent service! Food was fine but a bit oily. Indoor seating was cozy in a comfortable way. Very accessible. Wine and beer available. Tres leches cake was delish once it came close to room temp. We plan to return for lunch. This visit was for dinner.<//Review>

Great service & price, lots of food per $, flavor was a bit short of my criollo expectations. I will still recommend it.< /text>

<Review>A few Yelp reviews mentioned ownership changed when the original owner passed away. After my first try at this place I think that's true. Flavors I tasted were not authentic Cuban, more like a poor imitation. Prices and portions are good as you get a sale and dessert with the specialty entrees so it gets two starts. The soup I had was good but dessert tasted like instant stuff from the grocery store.<//Review>< Response>

I loved the ox tail dish! The meat was tender with great flavor. Dessert was included and I got through rice pudding. It came cold so I asked if it could be warmed up. So good!  Took me back to my childhood!  We will be back.< /Review>

<review>I hardly ever give restaurants 5 stars but I have absolutely no complaints about Felix Cafe.
-Food was excellent. Very unique and flavorful.
-Great, fast, and friendly service.
-Large portion for the price.

I review a restaurant on 4 criteria:

food: 5
service: 5
decor: 4
price to portion ratio: 5

average score: 4.75, rounded up to 5.< /review>< pics>

Another Cuban restaurant that has lost what they once were.  Ever since the Father passed the manner in which they cut corners on cooking the food saddens me.  Saturday was and is Garbanzo Bean soup day. Best soup I've eaten besides my moms.  Buuttt... Now they are using canned garbanzo beans instead of the original way they use to do it. How can one tell.... The beans are stiff and hard and they do not let it simmer long enough to obtain the flavor of the seasoning  or the bean to open properly.  Too bad it is a rare gem being lost.  Ramon we or I miss your dedication to making your customers happy with the quality of food and service<//text>

Tasty authentic Cuban cuisine, but everything on the menu is not always available, so If you have a favorite dish, make sure you call ahead and confirm the availability.
Very cozy setting, but not a lot of leg room. Outside seating is available.
Great for couples and coffee.< /text>

<text>This is a great place for a delicious breakfast. It’s a Cuban restaurant so many of the dishes Cuban delicacies but they also serve your typical American food. There plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating. All the employees are kind and helpful. I had an empanada and the crust was perfectly flaky and the filling was delicious. Here’s a fun fact: the restaurant is actually named after the owner’s first cook.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< username>

The food was always fresh and tasty. It’s a Cuban place so many of the dishes are Cuban delicacies, but they also serve American food. Be back again and try their other dish.<//Text>

Absolutely one of the best bargains between San Diego and Los Angeles. The food is excellent and the service is better than 99% of restaurants within their price range out there.  Don't ask what to order, follow your heart - it's just THAT good.  My go to is the red snapper- but it's no ordinary dish.  The entire staff is like family.  They are loyal to the owners and loyal to the customers, many who've been going there for over 25 years.  This is not just a restaurant, it's an iconic American venue</review>

The portions are huge so you definitely get your money's worth, but it's missing a lot of the spice & flavor that I love about Cuban cuisine.   This would be a good place for someone who is unfamiliar with the cuisine though, since it's very mild and less "ethnic" than traditional Cuban food.<//Review></record>

Food is always delicious, like they have a fleet bbn of grandma's in the back cooking. Carne con papas and the tres leches cake are my favorites. Because we have babies,  we usually order for pickup.</Review>

It's been a family favorite for many years now. You might have to wait to be seated and choose to sit outside, your choice,but if your not a fan of small bathrooms(2)....this isn't a place for you. But the food is amazing.< /text>

We went here because we miss Nandos, and these guys have a similar concept. The food tastes good, but don't go in expecting it to be like Nandos because it's not. I still like it though! The service is also great!< /Text>

<review>There's a reason this place is always packed to the gills and there's a crowd waiting to get in. Located in the heart of the Old Town Orange Circle, Felix is known for a mixture of Latin cuisines offered for lunch and dinner. It's advised you arrive before it opens and with your whole party present if you want to be seated right away.<//review>< Resp>

This is a small cafe with great food. I ordered the media noche sandwich and it was perfect. The staff was attentive and friendly.  The low point of the meal was the espresso I ordered afterwards. They used instant coffee. I'm sure they have limited space in the kitchen area, but the coffee did not have the same level of quality as the food.<//Text>

<text>I had a Cuban sandwich delivered by GrubHub . I was so disappointed . The ham was burned the pork was  extremely dry there was no mustard , there were two little pieces of pickle and no cheese . It tasted burned . It came with black bean soup that was very good . I love Cuban sandwiches and this was the biggest disappointment maybe they just had an off day<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcd9e711e3d2c7:0x4c949f7825fb303e</gmap_id>< user_name>

I've eaten at Felix's for thirty years. It remains a very consistent restaurant, and one where the locals eat. A nice selection of meat, fish and chicken Cuban cuisine. Most meals begin about $13. For that one gets a hearty bowl of soup, or small salad, bread, the entree and one of three desserts. I like the plain Chicken Cubano, a half a roasted bird, a big helping of delicious rice, black beans and plantains. If you like a warm green sauce ask for it on the side. My wife enjoys the rice and chicken with vegetables. I do not eat meat, however traditional pork and beef dishes are plentiful on the menu. I like to pay for a slice of their homemade chocolate cake and then take home the dessert which comes with the meal for a snack the next day. Enjoy your meal with a drink of wine or a beer.

Try the breakfasts, many of which come with either a Tostada Latina, two slices of batter cooked french bread with a guava puree between, or the Fritter, a sort of cooked pastry ball with a sweet sauce. Most breakfasts are between $10 and $14. You can eat well for $10. Most breakfasts also include a small juice.

Service is good, people are nice and helpful. It's located in the Orange Circle. Parking is more easily found beyond the circle in several adjoining parking lots.

Try Felix's once and you'll likely return.< /review>

I want to rate this higher for having such a nice atmosphere with the outdoor seating in the Circle, but after getting a taste for Cuban food in Florida I have to say the food here overall is bland. Not bad, just not what I came know and love before.< /Text>

The rice was tasteless and cold.  Not real Spanish rice.  Poor quality food. Bread came smashed.  The spinach was also cold and tasteless. Didn't even like the tres leches cake.  Yuck. Wish I never wasted a night out there.<//Review>

Little drizzly but great day to visit the Orange circle and have breakfast at Felixs. We each ordered omelettes and split to sample I had shrimp and crab my friend had chorizo. Both excellent. And service was wonderful. Had been for lunch but not breakfast but proved to be just as good!</Review>

We got vanilla late that tasted like out of a can instead of Cafe con leche... We expected a true Cuban coffee. Not a traditional Cuban Mojo but rather an american dressing. Walked out semi-satisfied. Their Bread Pudding with Pineapple and Raisins was delicious.< /text>

Food hasn't been the greatest last few times I've been. I have come for years but now it seems as things have changed. I was super excited to show off the food to a good friend and they were visibly disappointed.< /review>

Some of my in-laws immigrated from Cuba, when we are meeting somewhere and want authentic Cuban cuisine, this is where we go.  Always reliably good.</review>

This has been my favorite restaurant for decades! Although this is a Cuban restaurant, it comes very close to my Moms' home cooking which is Puerto Rican cooking. I usually  get pierna de puerco. Dessert is included & there's usually enough leftovers for the next day. I usually opt for the hommade soup of the day no matter how hot it is outside.
I celebrate my birthday here almost every year! Excellent customer service!< /text>

The paella was not all that. The chicken and beef tasted like it was boiled before adding. Disappoint, would not return again.</review>

Incredible food at a great price.  The breakfast on the weekend is especially good.  I recommend the Tostada Latina and Pisto a la Cubana for breakfast and the empanadas and pretty much any entree for dinner.</review>

If you like cuban cuisine this might be a good place. It was crowded (which is a good sign)

Did not go inside, but that was mostly due to the cold temperatures outside and everyone was in there trying to get away from the cold air.
So we had to settle with outside and the heat lamps of which there were too few and not in good placement.

But if you like Spanish cuisine, im not so sure this is the one for you. My preference is PAELLA, I really know what works and what doesn't. The Paella (Valencia) in particular did not even come near my standards or even what is the standard to expect.

I know there are a lot of variations but this just was let me simply say this... NO!

The rice was more of a soggy mess, and was way too much. It overwhelmed the seafood and there was no socrate or socarrat. Speaking of seafood, (only one mussel), no clams (that I could make out), the shrimp was good (4), a few squid (no tentacles) and the fish was so mashed I could not find any decent pieces, the sausage (was more of a chorizo) had no business in there)

So if you like Paella don't eat that here, anything else perhaps but I will seek my dining in the downtown city of orange elsewhere and my Paella at other places I have been.< /Text>

<date>1299186727720</date><Rating>3< /Rating><text>This is a typical cafeteria style Cuban restaurant, the prices are fair and the food is fairly good.

On my last visit I was disappointed, I decided to try their paella, but found out that instead of using "imported spanish chorizo" like it is stated in their menu, they are using cheaper Mexican chorizo which is like night and day.

I mentioned this to the owner and he did not seem like he was going to lose any sleep over it, however he did ask if I wanted a different plate. It is a shame, a good paella deserves good Spanish chorizo.</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) My rating is zero, the food is not good, the service is the worst, the restaurant inside smells awful so much that we prefer to eat outside just because of the stinky smell inside. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR ANYTHING 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Mi calificación es cero, la comida no es buena, el servicio es de lo peor, el restaurante adentro huele horrible tanto que preferimos comer afuera solo por el olor apestoso adentro. NO RECOMIENDO ESTE LUGAR PARA NADA 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻< /review>
