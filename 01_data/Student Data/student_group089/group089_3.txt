Ace of Fades has the best quality haircuts at reasonable prices.  The barbers there can do a wide range of styles and their fades are exceptional!  Their availability is good as well and they are very accommodating.< /Text>

I went there for a line up and tapper. Just my beard and sides. I had to go home and fix it. I spent 50 bucks and still didn’t get what I asked for. The guys hands smelled like he just got done eating and he didn’t wash them. It’s all good, but I won’t be going there anymore.< /review>

<Text>I typically don't go out of my way to do reviews, but I must say that this place is worth my time.  I have been here on 3 separate occasions and have had my hair trimmed and/or faded by 3 different barbers, including Ali "Ace" himself.

They all did a fantastic job.  As a result, I have suggested this place to a few of my friends, all of whom, have had equally satisfying experiences.

Highly recommend.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is the first time Ive written a review. My experience was so terrible that I felt obligated to do so. When I went into the shop I was immediately greeted with a smile. I asked the gentlemen in the first chair how many people are waiting. Visibly there were 3 however he told me that I'd be next because 1 was waiting for another barber not yet in and the other two were hanging out I guess. So I said cool and paid the meter and took a seat. There were 4 out 5 barbers and right before a chair was available an older gentleman walked in. And as soon as the chair became available the barber immediately asked him tp take a seat. I am a very patient person so I decided not to say anything halfway assuming maybe he had an appointment. (making excuses for them, I guess). So now about a 45 minutes had gone by, a long time for being next. Then the barber in the first chair was done so of course I assumed that he'd be the one to cut me next. Nope! He grabbed one of the guys that was sitting there before I walked in. After he had said the he didn't want a cut! So, ok he changed his mind, I can't get upset after all he WAS there before I. So now I have been there for a little over an hour. Finally the barber directly in front is finished, by then there isn't anyone else waiting but me. The 5th chair barber gets in and grabs the last guy waiting before I. Clearly Im next. NOPE! The barber disappears to the back and 10 minutes later emerges with basket full of towels. Now I am sitting there, looking at an open chair, watching the only available barber fold towels, like he works for bed, bath and beyond and not a barbershop. By now things are extremely awkward because no one has said anything to me since I first walked in, in fact no one even acknowledged that I was there. I guess they assumed that I just wanted to watch them cut other peoples hair and talk about there trip to Vegas. Then Finally after about an hour and a half, the first and only guy that had spoke to me and asked the most obvious question "Are you still waiting?" I said yes of course then he gets the towel folding barber and asks him to cut my hair. SMDH! I was directly in front of the guy the whole time. I finally get in the chair and the barber had zero conversation, actually it seemed as though he hated his job and would much rather be folding towels than cutting my hair. I should've risked it but I did. I have to say it was the most awkwardly silent 30 minutes of my hair cut life. I am 35 and have been getting a hair cut all over the country every other week since I was 5. Honestly this fade was subpar to even supercuts or great clips. I wouldn't recommend this shop to even a homeless person, even if the cut was free. I wish they had a 303 Barbershop out here. Always top of the line fades and not once have I been disappointed.< /Text>

Never had a bad experience coming to this Ace location only pet peeve is that it is short staffed. Otherwise, I will continue to come to this location for my financial needs. Zully is always a great worker. Always friendly and professional. Keep up the good work.< /Review>

This is the most horrible place i have been to with ace they have long ass lines only one girl working. Long wait time the inside looks like crap. Than asked about a title loan amd was not to informative about getting loan. Not even the basic information about a title loan could she answer. Very rude not good in customer service i cannot believe loanmart is allowing this type of treatment to customer's after them making me feel like crap i just drove down to titlemax and got treated the right way they were able to answer all my questions and did not have to stand in line for a representative that does not know how to answer a question and walked out with 10k in 30 minutes</Text>

Small and simple local place for breakfast and coffee.  Ample of space with big wide windows.  I was sitting here for about an hour on a Sunday morning and there was a steady trickle of customers coming in and out.  It looks like the place has been there for a while and could probably use a face lift.  Other than that, a good place to sit for a cup of coffee and toasts.<//Text>

You order a cheeseburger and someone makes the choice to pick up that stale old bread and make you a burger and then have you pay for it... if I hadn't used the drive-Through, I would have thrown it back at them.</Text>

< Review>
Love the charbroiled taste of the cheeseburgers. Also the flavoring in the burgers are enjoyable.  The french fries are crisp on the outside and soft and hot on the inside.  Friendly staff and a simple drive thru window.  When I call in an order, it is always ready by the time I get there.</Review>

Could be a bit of a wait but very worth it. Food is made Fresh! Chorizo breakfast burrito is very flavorful and not greasy.

Strawberry milkshakes from Burgers and More are the BEST!
Icy consistency as opposed to creamy and thick and amazing flavor!</text>

the worst service. at 10am june 17th i ordered food through an app. when i was greeted by a very rude employee. he told me in a few words that he was going to send an incomplete order and i should fight the app if it was a problem. when i requested a cancellation of my order he hung up. afterwards i called again and he gave me the name jose. unsure it is real or not dont buy here through apps!</text>

I love this place. Service is always warm and friendly, even when it's clear the kitchen is understaffed. The food is good and affordable. These are actually my favorite fries. Seasoned and just the right balance of soft and crispy. Fountain drinks and wifi available too.< /Review>

I just had one of the best chicken sandwiches ever. Very delicious and goes well with fries. This sandwich had 2 delicious, juicy pieces of chicken. The serving size is generous. I highly recommend this place. They have s variety of choices for meals and plates to choose from. Definitely something to choose again.</Review>

Single window drive thru takes a minute, but portions and pricing is absolutely wonderful. Cant beat a bigass cheeseburger w everything on it, an order of fries and an orange bang. If its busy be patient, but the selection of food is actually pretty incredible considering the size of the kitchen and storage areas.< /Text>

<Review>Best DIVE joint in Alhambra, California!  I've been going there for over 20 years.   FYI,  their short order cook is one of the original hot dog cooks in the San Gabriel Valley--- popularizing fried hot dogs back in the day.  He's very proud of it, so order a dog when you're there.   I also recommend their breakfast and lunch specials, too.</Review>< Rating>

It has changed ownership, so the quality of food has gone down.  The waitress or cashier gal needs better customer service skills.  Use to LOVE this place now it's just a OK.  Sad because it was one my family's favorite place to eat.< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>The burgers are fantastic here. The true gem of the menu, in my opinion, is their grilled chicken plate with beans, rice, and a salad. This place has been around for a very long time but their chicken's taste has never changed. It's beyond words how good the chicken is paired with pita bread and ranch. Would definitely recommend eating here.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2c50e1d987207:0x66b59c906bfb89d0<//GmapID>< pics>

<review>I would have given them a 5/5 If the place didn't appear dated. Additionally, It would have been appreciated if the airconditioner was operational at that time.

Now, let's talk about the 4 stars! I rated them a four star establishment based upon the quality, presentation, taste, and good portion provided. I am impressed!!!

You have to sample the good to believe how fresh and well seasoned  their food is!

Will be back guys, thank you! Lunch today was more than great!

More power!

My rating is for the french fries. Seasoned french fries. Fries don't have lardy greasy texture. Good for the fries cravings.</Text>

I had ordered a fried chicken sandwhich and instead got a chicken tender sandwchich. The worst place I have ever been to and will never be coming back. Cheap and false advertisement, they need to stop making food that looks like a 12 year old made it and then to be charged way too much.<//review>

Not very friendly service. I ordered a chicken salad to go. It tasted okay, but they put hot chicken on the salad so it kinda wilted and warmed the lettuce and tomatoes. I paid extra for cheese, but they put a little sprinkle of cheese on it. The serving size was not worth the $9.00 that I paid.< /Review>

<text>I've been coming here for the last 11 it so years. This used to be one of my weekly haunts but something has changed. They're not as generous as they used to be with the portions as you can see by my photo. There are hardly any fries. I usually get the chicken plate. It's absolutely delicious, but they cut down on the amount of fries, zucchini and onion rings.  They didn't even give me zucchini the last time. I used to get the chicken salad which is very tasty. The last time I got the salad it was a lot smaller than before.
I'll only go here now if my coworkers are headed her for lunch, even then I'll have an inner debate. I suppose they are trying to economize.
Parking is good. The service is pretty fast. Restrooms are outside in the back, which were very clean when I used them last. There is a drive thru. It's usually hot to warm inside. They have fans to move the air. There is a TV to watch. They take cash and debit cards. The soft drinks are self serve. There is free Wi-Fi available. The coffee is decent.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Their beans taste like they were made with no love, they put dry hard rice in my order as well. they also pay poor attention when it comes to listening to a customers order. when asked specifically to have cheese on an order and for the 3rd time in a row find it missing is also a bummer.</review>

<review>I have been here 4 times and 3 of the times they were closed. The one time I was able to get food it was just decent. The hot link po boy was more bread then anything else. I tried to give an honest opinion but I can't seeing as 2 times it was closed, it was A monday and sunday and the third time the whole business was shut down due to a family emergency. EVERYONE IS RELATED OR WHAT?</review>< Pictures>

One star for the bottle of OJ .I am amazed at the other 4 star reviews this dump gets I thought they must be writing their own reviews or these people dont get out much .That being said the food taste like it was all made from one old grease pan , the tv even had a big spot on the screen.the tables and walls were filthy I still gave It a shot and felt like after I got shot " In the gut". I am a native of Alh, and dont want anyone getting the wrong idea about burger joints here go to Ricks even J&b.< /Text>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>Found a open staple in my hashbrowns that I almost ate.  The hashbrowns did not have much flavor (no salt) and the eggs were a bit small and undercooked but the bacon was good. I'm still bumbed out about the staple. It's almost as bad as when I found a piece of string from a rag in my hashbrowns at some other burger joint. I must have the worst luck.

(Translated by Google) It is the first time that I visit this place
I ordered a burrito de asada, the truth is that the flavors and seasonings are rich and tasty, I highly recommend it, although the facilities are a little dated, but the food helps, I recommend visiting it

<rate>5<//rate><review>This is a great local rental place to rent a car. It’s close to the airport and they also offer a shuttle service which is very convenient. We had originally booked through a third party and had to cancel the reservation. Vince went above and beyond to assist us with making a new booking at a very reasonable rate. He was very professional and provided us with excellent service. Highly recommend this place and Vince for your car rental needs.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Terrible business. I rented from them and they sent my PAID BILL to collections. They also included in collections the amount billed to their company making the collections bill twice what my own responsibility was. This has affected my credit score with an illegitimate bill. I am fighting it with the creditor providing proof that this was paid on my CREDIT CARD and that they rebooked me 3 months after the fact. Completely a waste of time to use this rental company. Pay more and go to a legitimate business. Even when we did visit we waited an hour for them to give us the car.</Text>

This place is amazing and very user friendly. Always willing to work with customer and go out of their way to help. For example, I needed to drop the car off and get an Uber 25+ minutes away and Jesse offered to take me back so I didn’t have to Uber. Great place and great people! Will always rent a vehicle from here when I need one or family comes into town!<//review>

Horrible customer service. You have to call them to have a shuttle pick you up but no one answers the phone.  Left 5 messages and never got a call back. No one ever picked us up.  Had to go to another company and pay twice as much. Dont waste your time here.</text>

<Review>I normally book through national car rental agencies like Enterprise but thought I would try using Kayak and came across this place. Less expensive so I gave it a try. Previous bad reviews scared me but I can say that I received excellent service! When I’m in San Diego again I will definitely book with them! Great price, clean car, on time service and friendly, professional staff.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d954b489f98099:0x9afdbd0eaea5cc7e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Stay away from this shady local rental car company. My rental car was merely driven 65 miles when I parked it at my hotel in Menifee, CA. The rental car remained parked overnight, and when I got in to drive to San Diego the dashboard signaled with a low tire pressure indicator. I step out and the tire is flat to the ground. I had to change the tire myself since I declined their coverage and they wouldn't send roadside assistance (fine).

I get back to return the rental car and I'm told I have to file an incident report because of the flat tire (no foreign objects were found that would have punctured the tire). The rental car would be taken to a service center so they can determine if the tire can be patched or it has to be replaced altogether. According to them, the rental car was given to me in good condition and I'm returning it with a flat tire...what assurances do I get the company has properly done maintenance on the tires???

A few days I get a call from Fernando (Accounting) telling me I owe them $100 for the tire. He gives me no explanation as to why the tire needed to be replaced and why it can't be patched. I tell him I'd pay as long as a valid reason is given to me. He can't give me a reason because the service center didn't put one in the paperwork even though they "thoroughly investigated it".

I call my personal insurance so they can find out what happened but they're unable to get a hold of Fernando and they leave 2 voicemails. I then receive an email from a third-party claims company and now I'm due $150 which will go to collections if not fully paid which will impact my credit score.

Rental Car Cafe and its business practices need to be called out because they're clearly not willing to work with their customers and ultimately make the rental experience a nightmare. I will never rent from them again, and though their rates may be low, I encourage you to stay away from them (pay the extra money and go to an established and trusted rental car company).<//review>

Update: I was able to obtain the estimate report from the car service center (Evans Tire & Service Centers) through the third-party claims company and I was able to call them. After providing some information, they confirmed the following: 1) they didn't inspect or even look at the tire 2) Justin (Owner of Car Rental Cafe) personally knows the manager of the car service center for years and had called him from his personal mobile phone to tell him to go ahead and outright replace the tire. Of course, I follow up with Fernando and he basically washes his hands and even goes as far to tell me I was at fault because I was given the opportunity to settle with them on the side and now things were out of their hands and can't do anything to help and implies I'm making this up.

Car Rental Cafe and its shameless and shady business practices need to be called out because they're clearly not willing to work with their customers and ultimately make the rental experience a nightmare. I will never rent from them again, and though their rates may be low, I encourage you to stay away from them as far away as possible (pay the extra money and go to an established and trusted rental car company). Car Rental Cafe will take advantage of you as a renter, and stiff you with a bill that's is unfounded because they engage in this kind of deplorable methods.<//review>

Absolutely awful experience. I reserved a rental car through a third party to pick up at the car rental cafe. Up on arrival they told me that free mileage was not included. Even though I showed the agent a copy of my contract that stated very clearly that my package included unlimited free miles. He refused to honor that. He tried to charge me an additional $40 for mileage. Then I tried to cancel my reservation the rental was $35 per day and guess what? The cancellation fee was $35. Absolute rip-off. I couldn't get a hold to any parties by phone and they told me to submit my complaint via email. Only I couldn't find any email link. So I'm going through my bank to get my money refunded I would avoid this place like the plague. No customer service and absolutely horrid business practices. If you decide to go there anyway, just know that you have been warned.
PS. it was really an emergency situation since I couldn't pick up my car at the car rental Cafe I went over to the airport rental car center and another company gave me a really nice car and matched the price that I didn't get from rental car Cafe... With unlimited miles some people know customer service, and some people don't.< /Text>

Be aware that they charge mileage fees on top of the rental fee. Its showing unlimited  mileage on the website but its not true. Trying to save money on this care rental company will cost you more. Not recommend at all.<//review>

Great experience! We got a car for $80 all fees included for 4 days. A short shuttle ride from the airport to ACE. They provide the shuttle for free and the wait was short. Excellent way to save money on a rental. The car we drove had less than 2000 miles on it. Will definitely use them again.< /Review>

<text>This car rental business was recommended by our hotel (Westin - Gaslamp District).  My mom, niece and I rented the car to drive the coast of southern California for a day.  We were picked up at the hotel and taken to the car lot. Our paperwork was processed in less than 10 minutes and they gave us an upgrade to a mid size car.  No pressure to buy the "extras".  When we dropped the car off we were immediately shuttled back to the hotel.  Great experience all the way around!  I would recommend this service.</text>< Pics>

I rarely give one star however in this case I must. I am getting my car worked on down the road and this place was recommended. I had to renew my license and I have my official dmv papers as well as my actual identification and the guy at the counter treated me as if I wasn’t human. Horrible service.</review>

<text>The car was fine.  But they were clearly not set up to accommodate our family of 5.  We dropped the car off with plenty of time to make it to the airport but the only van they had left after we arrived and told us someone else was driving us.  Went into the office and they said we would have to wait for that same van to return.  Unorganized and clearly low budget.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>My wife and I were on our honeymoon and it was the first time we had ever rented a car. Half way through our honeymoon we received a ticket for the car not being registered. Our honeymoon was in June and the registration expired in March... As a car rental company they should always be on top of their vehicles being registered. We called them, and they told us to come back in and we can give them the ticket and they will pay for it. They informed us not to worry about being charged for the ticket. So we turned around from where we were going and drove 35 minutes back to the car rental shop to give them the ticket and get a temporary registration for the car. By this time the guy we talked to over the phone wasn't working anymore, he was done for the day and he didn't leave any notes like he said he would. So we had to re explain the whole situation to someone new. That employee said they would leave a note saying that they are comping us gas for our whole honeymoon. When we took the car back that note wasn't there either, and once again we were talking to someone new who we had to explain the whole situation to again.  luckily we didn't have to pay for any of the gas. Once again they informed us not to worry about the ticket and that they will pay for it. A month has gone by and we received a letter in the mail stating that we were charged for the ticket, and a $50 service fee. We called Travcar, talked with someone new, had to explain the whole situation again because no one left any notes or had any kind of documentation about the ticket, and we were told that the citation company who sent us the letter isn't a company they do business with. They gave us the number to call and it was the exact same number as what was on the letter we received. They don't even know who they do business with. Not only that but we called every day for nearly 5 days and we talked to someone new every single time, had to re explain the situation and were told the manager would call us back. The manager never called us back and every time we asked for the manager he was always "gone". They were trying to charge us for a ticket that we received and had no control over. Finally we got a hold of the citation company and they waived the fee and will be refunding our money. It has been a complete joke. No one keeps track of anything, they don't know who they do business with, and they don't pay attention to the cars they rent out to people. Still the manager hasn't tried to reach out and contact to us, and as my wife and I see it, we should be getting a whole refund. So check your statements and see if they charged you for anything they shouldn't have and if you're planning on renting from them, check and see if your car is registered. Take pictures of the condition of the car yourself, take pictures of the license plates, and if the car isn't actually registered, they put the temporary registration on the passenger side of the windshield. If the car isn't registered and they don't have that temporary registration on the windshield, don't take the car. You will have an experience like this. Hope this helps.< /review>< userid>

This was the WORST company I have ever rented a car from.  They added additional charges.  Started at trying to add $250 for a service dog in the car.  The seats were covered with a canopy/seat cover.  Roller taken to all parts of the car.  Then they lowered it to $150, then $75.  No hair, car completely cleaned, no smell we used Lysol to make sure.  We rent cars 3 weekends a month on our business travels.  This was a REAL service medical alert dog. Not a fake SD dog. Owner refused to return our calls.</Review>

<Review>DONT DO IT. Not only did it take 2 hours to receive a car that was smaller than what I paid for. The initial car that they tried to rent me had clearly been in a accident. The bumper was visibly smashed in on the drivers side rear. When I refused to take the car,  the worker became indignant and made me wait longer. I had to become irate in order to receive a vehicle. This after traveling all day from the East Coast with a toddler.  Also, during my time with the car the check air pressure light continued to come on. Causing me to have to get air at least 3 times. Lastly, upon return of the car (couldn't wait to get rid of it), I checked my credit card account which showed that they didn't take a 200.00 dollar deposit but charged my credit card 200.00. I have dealt with many rental company's out of LAX in the past where said deposit would pend until car was returned. When I called to question this charge which I now had to pay interest on, I was met with the rude response, "all companies are different". Sir you aren't lying. This place SUCKS! Do yourself a favor, DONT DO IT!</Review><user>103163309481029258545< /user></record></dataset><record>

The car I got was fine, and the prices were reasonable, but I don't recommend this place unless you have PLENTY of extra time during your trip that you don't mind spending picking up and dropping off your car.  I booked through Orbitz, but it wasn't made clear when I did that when you take the shuttle to the offsite renal car hub, you then have to call a posted number wait for a second shuttle to come pick you up to go to their office.  Once I reached the office, the check-in process proceeded at a glacial pace.  Then I got to wait yet again, while someone collected my car, washed it  and delivers it to me.  Since the parking lot is tiny, the movement of cars takes considerable time.  As I recall, I needed nearly 2 hours from the time I left the airport until I was in my rental car.  This process was then reversed when I left.  My recommendation is to spend a few extra dollars and rent from someone more professional, and based out of the rental car hub.</Review>

Offered me a $15 credit towards another rental, as if I would ever and the customer service woman, say ohh you should have taken that cause you aren't getting your money back and my reps are truthful and would never do that.

This is the same company as Ace Rent a car.  BEWARE!  Here is my review of Ace:

Every negative review is true.  This place has poor customer service, lies about fees, overcharges and underdelivers.

They close earlier than their competitors and open later.  This is not a case of "you get what you pay for" - you get much worse than that.  You could not pay me to use them again.  Here's a brief summary of what happened to me in just one time using them:

1) My flight was delayed, so my arrival changed to 10:30pm.  Not a problem for a normal rental car service - except Ace closes at 10pm.

2) I called ahead to inform them of my delay, and they didn't have any solution except to see if my hotel could shuttle me home and then back in the morning.  All at my cost.

3) After I paid for a taxi to and from my hotel, they claimed they gave my rental car away, even though I spoke to the same woman (Veronica) both times.  She then tried to tell me they could "upgrade me" - for a fee... even though I had a reservation the whole time.  I asked how they could give my rental away if they were closed, and she didn't have a response except to get defensive and to tell me "I should have called again."  AGAIN?  I already told you I was going to be late!

4) The man who checked me in said the insurance policy was $8 for the entire weekend.  This sounded odd, so I confirmed - "It's $8 and covers for the entire weekend?" - he said yes.  Turns out, it was $9... PER DAY.  So not only did he lie, he even had the price wrong.

5) My return flight took off at 7am.  Every other rental car service opens much earlier than this.  Ace opens at 7am.  Their solution?  Drop the car off at Park & Go (which also had awful, awful customer service), AND pay a $15 fee.

All in all, using Ace ended up costing me more and giving me more heartburn.  Avoid at all costs - any pennies you MIGHT save are not worth it.</review>

First off MAKE SURE to check the gas. They tell you it's full but they LIE. We were told our gas tank was full but it showed 7/8th full so we paid extra for gas since we had to return it full. The reason we didn't say anything was because we had a long day and just wanted to get to our hotel. The rep, Jose, took forever to give us a car we already paid for. Also, as we were talking to the rep another guy came back and said that his gas tank was also not full. I'm sure they do this all the time to rip people off and make money since we experienced it and the only other guy there experienced it as well. Make sure you show up at the right time to pick up your rental or else there are up charges!!! We were not informed of this but apparently that's their policy.<//review>

<text>The low prices are not worth the hassle here. Always check exactly what you're being charged for and read your receipts carefully, or you might get overcharged without you knowing! Thank God I was at least somewhat warned about this, so here I am passing on that warning (confirmed by my own experience) to you all. Initially I booked them for 4 days because they were the cheapest car rental I could find. I was moving cross country and waiting for my car to arrive, and so I only needed a rental car for a little over a week before mine would arrive. On Priceline I paid around $48 for an economy car. I get there, exhausted after about 12 hours of flying (and yes, two shuttles from the airport, as mentioned by another reviewer, the second of which they never called to let me know they arrived, leaving me waiting for about 10-15 mins in drizzling rain with many suitcases). I tell them I don't want any of their insurance, I will use my own, and I will fill up the gas on my own (no additional charges, in other words). The guy then says, "Okay your car is going to take a few more minutes to get ready, but we have a few Hyundai's ready for you now, midsize cars" (i.e. an upgrade). I tell him it's okay, I'll wait. My car arrives, it's a blue Nissan Sentra, and I complete the paperwork and drive off (and I found out later I was supposed to get a receipt and the rental agreement, didn't get either).

The next day I decide to just extend my 4 day rental to 11 days, and call Travcar/Ace to do so. The guy reads out the charges to me, "So it'll be $73 for your initial 4 days..." And I'm like WHAT?!? I paid $48, not $73! And he goes, "No, you agreed to a midsize vehicle, I see it right here". We start arguing, he says he can't refund the difference nor remove it from the next reservation I'm about to make without tacking on an additional $10/day for extending the rental. I decide to return the midsize vehicle I have and cease all business with them. I cancel my apartment hunting plans and drive over there furious. The guy realizes I never got a receipt, so I didn't know what I was being charged for, and lets me keep the midsize for economy price, and says I won't be charged the $73 (it was still pending at that point when I checked my banking app, so I believed they would change it). That was nice of him.

Based on that goodwill and because it was simply more convenient for me, plus the price being low relative to other vendors, I place a new reservation for an economy car for the remaining 7 days I'd need a car. It comes out to about $125 on Priceline (so total, $48 + $125 = $173). I go to swap my midsize car for an economy. The guy, knowing all my previous history, says that he can let me keep this midsize car for even cheaper than the economy car. The difference from last time would also be rolled in to that charge. Ultimately I am charged $173, which isn't cheaper than what I had originally, but oh well, I got to keep my car for economy prices.

TL;DR Book with caution here. Make sure you get a receipt and read your receipts very carefully to make sure you're getting charged only for what you paid for, nothing more.<//text>< Gmap_id>

I had the same experience. In their website it stated UNLIMITED miles and when i picked up the car, the teller keeps telling me that he can give me 500miles for a week. I told him that i drive 50miles oneway to work! and your site said unlimited...WOW!  I was constantly being charged on my credit card and i decided to keep the car longer and they said i had to come in and redo the paperwork and they charged me more perday. i didnt check the agreement because it was suppose to be a date change but when i look at my bill on my credit card it was charged for almost double. Their customer service really sucks and cannot get anyone to call you back. After complaining for a week, they decided to send me a $50 gift certificate on my next rental with them which i dont think i would ever rent from them AGAIN!< /review>

I wish I had the option of voting with a "star" level for service from TravCar........TravCar would get ZERO stars!!  Living in Vienna, Austria, makes contacting the clowns at TravCar frustrating!!  The concierge at the Marriott Hotel in Torrey Pines suggested I use them when I stayed there recently.  The guy dropping off the car at the hotel was friendly enough and that's where the "service" ends.

A few days after the rental car terminated I had another debit made to my credit card for an amount of around $33 which I can only assume was for the gas used.  I since have sent numerous emails and "online contact" requests via their website to clarify what this charge was for.  I also requested an invoice/receipt for the payment as my company needs this for tax and expense purposes.

Do you thing that the imbecile's at TravCar have had the courtesy of responding.....nothing, nil, nada, nich, nulla........SAD!!

Looking at the other reviews on TravCar (on Yelp! for instance) there is only one thing that I can suggest- RENT ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!</Text>

Soo pretty. You can bring your blankets and lay it down on ground and have picnics. Or you can BBQ as well and enjoy this amazing view while eating or walking. My family and I had a blast visiting this place. California has the best coast (okay, I'm being biased because I'm a Californian).</Text>

<text>Park ranger was very helpful.  Showers are terrible. Women's side (loop D) has two showers and is one not working. The other has a gap in the wall where the soap dish was. Thus there is no place to put shampoo, conditioner, soap or razor. It was marginally clean. The only electric outlet has been blanked so you cannot dry your hair. Otherwise it is a nice park.<//text>< date>

<Text>Beautiful park & campground. Plenty of sites open in the off season. I thought the rates were a little high for winter & no hookups at all. The female camp host was very rude about us parking our truck in one of the 50 open sites. She could have been a bit nicer, we were happy to move it. It was fine for one nights stay on our way up the coast.< /Text>< pics>

Great spot for walking distance to the beach camping. I'm giving big thumbs up for recycling! Downside - too loud traffic close by, even nights are noisy...</Text>

Great Beach for the family. It's super flat, the ocean is pretty calm in this area and there's plenty of room to run around. Also, if your kids are into building things there is a ton of driftwood to make fun forts< /review>

The Metrolink/train passes right through at times and denpending on where you are camping,  you can hear cars on the highway. Aside from that, the park is well maintained and the beach is readily accessible. If you have kayaks or paddleboards there is a parking area you can drive up to close to the beach. Overall a great place to visit it escape. Just any campground, be mindful of the animals in the area.<//text>< pictures>

Just spent 4 days there. Great beach (although it was cold) Campgrounds were decent. We were in spot 64, which was between the highway and the beach. Heard more of the highway traffic at night,but if wasn't distracting. Showers have warm water which is why I gave 5 stars. Showers cost 25 cent for about 3 minutes.
Word of caution, the last night I thought I heard a familiar noise around 4am....sure enough the next morning my suspicion was right. Racoons got into and ripped our trash bag which was hanging on a line....so be careful....they have those little critters around the campgrounds. If ya can reserve a lot closer to the beach (79 thru 87).</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><response>None<//response><review>When traveling along the California Coast on the 101 near Santa Barbara, you simply must stop at El Capitan State Beach, even if only for a short while.  There is a $10 day use fee here, which is money well spent.  You'll experience a short, picturesque nature trail to a gorgeous beach.  Eye-pleasing greenery was everywhere when we visited in January.  We saw one jaw-droppingly massive tree surrounded by a bed of nasturtium, which stands out on this lovely trail.  The end of this short hike spits you out at a wide beach with boulder-sized algae-coated rocks on a part of it, and a flat sandy beach curving to the east. We also saw a fat Red-Shouldered Hawk, sunning itself in a tree on our hike, along with stunning beach views.</review>< Time>

<text>Nice campsite would be nicer if the camp host and ranger didn’t keep harassing us, big group campsite but all Hispanic families and we were the only ones to get warnings for making noise and having the generator on 🤷🏽‍♂️, and the best part when the ranger asked if we can listen to jazz music instead of our own music!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

If you are tent camping and/or a light sleeper at all - you won't sleep. I felt jarred awake every few minutes by the sound and never slept. Around 2 am I just drove home. a disappointing disaster of a trip.  :-( not going back unless I can somehow nab one of the 3 or 4 best spots in the place - which requires 6 months advanced planning/reservation or some amazing luck.<//Review>< Pics>

The most beautiful, best campground in the world in this reviewers opinion. Feel like you are in the mountains as you camp, then stroll down to the beach and walk along sandstone cliffs and the mostly calm ocean with the Channel Islands in sight. Birds, seals and other nature abound, so please keep dogs at the campsite and off the beach. The camp store is open all year. Please patronize it, as that keeps it going! Don’t forget your quarters for the showers (two minutes for 25cents what a deal!). Side note: be aware during fire season, conditions change quickly.</text>

A hidden gem just 20mins from SB with WAY less seaweed and people. Plenty of parking available. It was fairly windy when we went, but we had a relaxing time nonetheless - even saw some dolphins!<//Review>

< review>
One of my favorite local “beach” campgrounds. So many great tent camping sites with ocean views and nature walks nearby. The trails are great and most are dog friendly, shaded, and peaceful (except for the actual beach/sand... no dogs allowed). The beach itself is pretty with gorgeous rock formations at the far end- definitely worth the walk. The nature trails too run along a creek and are so lush, tranquil, and serene.

Depending on what you’re looking for, if you’re coming for camping, here are my suggestions for campsites: •Very shaded and private, near cost but not visible- more about trees and nature #99, Partial sea views and trees/privacy #101, Best and Fullest ocean views but more open/no shade #105-107, Complete nature cove of green and private, nearby access to ocean and trails #41.</review>

Watch out of you have a trailer.  Spaces are very short.  We had a horrible spot. Had to keep the truck right beside the trailer so it was on the pavement. We got scolded for it being slightly off.Couldn't open  the back door and we had a very high step into the front door. I am disabled so it was very hard!  Site was nice, very shaded. The fire rings are on the other side of the trailer.  Not convenient.   The campground does allow dogs but only in the camping area.  NO  where else.  Beings there were 2 pitbulls not leashed we had no where to walk our small dog and felt she was safe. We won't go back.  Great for tents however.</Text>

Though we've stayed here many times over the years, of late I've found myself not wanting to go here. The beach access is inconvenient which can't be helped. The camp hosts have been exceptionally rude. Watch out for the wasps and poison oak.</Text>

The sites are not cleaned well though between users.  The showers are not cleaned well.  When does the campground store open?  There is no RV waste dump site here which is a hassle! The camp site hosts have full hookups yet the paying public can't dump their waste!  Don't come here for the beach - go to Refugio for a slightly better experience. No RV waste dump at Refugio either!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80e94f2ab372a06f:0x99424ff936df09b9</gmapID></record>

Few selections of good dessert w/ reasonable prices. They open until late. They have quite a few branches. Parking kind of hard to find if you're going there during busy hours.<//review>

<name>RL Jones< /name><Date>1573423960075<//Date><rating>5< /rating><text>This is a convenient location that offers authentic Cantonese style food either to go or eat in at a relatively quick pace. There's also a variety of Asian style desserts and drinks. Service is very friendly and prompt. They are willing to amend dishes for whatever dietary needs you may have without hesitation. If you want a quick meal and do not have a large group, this is the perfect place to go.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c537c0f66137:0x58e0ae557b628d29< /GmapID></record>

The place is ok. 1- smoking outside patio 2-  parking is safe and easy to find the place. 3- food so so. 4- service ok.

<GmapID>0x80c2c537c0f66137:0x58e0ae557b628d29</GmapID><Review>Smaller Phoenix Bakery, but they were quick and friendly, even though they may struggle a little with English.  There is outside patio seating that takes over the side alley, which is larger than the seating area inside.  Phoenix is Cantonese desserts, so it had a niche outside of the predominantly Taiwanese boba tea that is in the area.<//Review><rating>4</rating>< Pictures>

<Text>The highlight of my 2.5 weeks holiday. Everything about this beautiful establishment is 5+ star. From the lovely staff, exceptional and thoughtful service to the beautiful interior and exterior buildings. All of the staff (reception, concierge, housekeeping and restaurant) managed that rare blend of professionalism with a friendly, warm and kind approach< /Text>< date>

Love the hot desserts: Walnut soup, Blacl bean-Sticky rice soup... Most food items on menu are good, e.g. Walnut shrimp. Don't get the Fish wt Vegetables, it's very bland.</review>

If you could accept some risk, there are immediate competitions on this block.  Thats for not so hot days.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

It's a gun shop..not a thrift store or a hardware store.. GUNS and ammo (if you buy a gun). I understand both the angst from customers and from the shop owners. These are sketchier times. As far as my runnings with the shop.. generally prickly at times and warmer customer service at other times.. just depends on the moment.  I have had excellent suggestions and have not been led astray for the sake of a sale. When something wasn't right about a purchase they took extra effort and even did some tactical repair work to make things right. I go back when the occasion arises. We don't have many options in San Francisco so just call before you go and get things clear about your intentions with the shop. My 3 cents...</Text>

<Review>I've had a few transactions here and I've been happy each time. They have a good system to manage the increased demand and space restrictions, their prices are reasonable, and they have a selection of handguns, shotguns, and rifles in stock (including some fixed-mag semi autos at the time of this review). Ammo is restricted to those purchasing a gun, which is common right now in the Bay Area. Staff are busy and may be focused or multitasking but they don't rush you and are willing to help the 1st time buyer through the process.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>First, they explain that you need to purchase a gun in order to purchase ammunition. Then, they’ll explain that ammunition is in short supply. One excuse after another, though, you probably won’t have much difficulty purchasing ammunition if they know you. Thank you Gavin Newsom and Nancy Pelosi.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rating>3</rating><Review>They had no ammo for me unless I purchased a gun, why would I get a gun when I have one and then have the waiting period, I was headed to the ranch, we have 1200 acres and Mt. Lions are very active. We have to keep kids and pets in, we needed ammo to resupply the ranch. Nothing worse than having no protection. Typically we fire off a few rounds during the day and early evening but not this trip I had four 357 shells no 30/30 and no 22 shells for a five day stay.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Waited for several hours do to covid crazieness. Was there to purchase with a friend and my girlfriend. After her waiting for two hours when we got to the front of the line they skipped several times us because of store capacity(3) and then since she wasn't sure she was going to buy a firearm the owner told her to leave. Then he proceeded to grab my arm and move me out of the way. Unfortunately, they had what I needed at this difficult time and so I made a significant purchase rather then waste the time.

The second time I returned to pick up my purchase the staff proceeded to insult me over taking the situation seriously. While John at the door and half the staff there are friendly and knowledgeable, the owner and his underlings are a dark spot on the other very nice people there.

I will not be returning to shop there and I suggest you bring your business elsewhere. I know it's hard to find available ammo(spoiler alert unless you're buying a Firearm they won't sell you ammo anyway) and firearms but finding a good shop that isn't insulting and demeaning to customers and potential buyers is more important.< /Review>

When I went to pick it up after the wait period, they tried to trick me and switched my purchase to a Glock 19 Gen 4. I am familiar with every detail between these two firearms. Although I had the paperwork and my receipt for the Glock 19 Gen 5, they tried to act like I purchased the Gen 4 even though you can clearly see I was charged and paid for the Gen 5.

Came in to ask a question about shipping a firearm from another state. Was told they don't do that. Asked if he he could point me in the right direction. Told me to Google it. The whole interaction had the vibe that they couldn't be bothered to talk to me. Nice quick way to lose a future customer. A shame because I would much rather support local than Bass Pro.< /Text>

Yeah .  Just a tad racist.  As one of the employees was helping me I noticed the tall young guy looking at me funny.  I could tell he was inspecting my look and profiling me. Then right in front of me he whisper something into the ear of the employee helping me and they started laughing.  I looked at him and he literally started turning red in the face right in front of me.  I didn’t purchase anything but I just continued to ask questions.  So from now on that is what I will do.  I’ll keep coming in and ask them questions.  Then I’ll go home and buy it online for a cheaper price.  Can’t wait to go back and just smile in their faces and ask more questions  .  This is the way you get even.  Make them work for nothing.  Online prices even with shipping is still way cheaper than this gun shop.</Text>

<Review>Their prices are a little bit more than other bay area dealers but they have a few guys who are real knowledgeable. For example Henry, the retired SFPD officer who worked at the Chinatown Vallejo Street precinct. To the young fella who started here after Jackson Arms closed. They never rush you and will continue to show you one product after another until you find the right fit.  One bad thing about them is that the parking often times fill up fast.</Review>< name>

<review>I never comment but after reading some of the reviews I just had to. This place is great, the perfect gun store to go to ask for one on one questions about anything gun related. Maybe Cali gun stores have to deal with a bunch of non-informed gun people and those people think it's like buying products from a Best Buy store when buying a gun.... it's not. Anyway, great store, great inventory and best of all, great prices. They will see me again in a month to buy the Sig I never thought to buy!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808f7a5455d01b85:0xa0e6bf0de2494054< /gmapID></record>

Another successful visit.   Good price on a consignment Astra 400 in excellent shape.

As always the staff behind the counter was professional and by the book.

I love the fact I visit this shop and expect fair and honest treatment that speak to me on my level while still being able to offer helpful suggestions.

Thanks City Arms!<//Text>

<Text>I would absolutely shop here again. And plan to. I went in with my apprehensive wife (new to the shooting scene) and she felt very comfortable and at ease in the store. The guy behind the counter that helped me took his time and helped me decide between 2 different 1911s. I have been to other shops up and down the coast and this was one of the most friendly and helpful I have been to.</Text><user_name>Nick Applebay</user_name>< Time>

Funny little gun store nestled between a yoga studio / massage parlor and a boba tea place, City Arms has a good selection of many different types of firearms, knives, and accessories.  While there is some camping/survival gear and bow-hunting gear, the store is much more specialized towards shooting sports, self defense firearms, and ammunition.  Staff has always been welcoming and friendly, and will answer questions or point you in the right direction if they do not have the item in stock.  I recommend this place for firearms.< /text>

<Text>I walked into the store and waited in line. After the guys behind the counter helped the other customers in front of me they ignored me. Not even a hello. One guy finally took notice. Seemed like a cool guy. I talked to him before about the .22 I bought from them.  They sell hunting/fishing licenses. Customer service needs to improve.</Text><user>115286511480532627783<//user>< Pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>A small, but solid gun store.

Quality: The selection is a bit minimal and cramped, but you can find the basics here with ease. I've yet to be offered junk.

Appeal: Finding any gun stores in an urban west coast city is a trick. Appeal is very high because it's so local!

Service: They are great. I buy an uncommon round and they are always ready to help me see what they have.< /text>< pictures>

They more wanted to sell me a gun than talk to me about my concerns. But it is a gun store so I see why, they answered all my questions though. Their office manager Colline is lovely and makes the processs a breeze. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful when it's busy you may have to wait a bit it's a gun shop it happens. A little more expensive than other places I've been but they are solid. Though occasionally they will say something off color or political, I'm not here for politics I'm here for a firearm and the culture around gun shops can be a little abrasive in my opinion again these people are lovely, ok knowledgeable, and professional.</Review>

<Review>Trust is the reason why I continue to do Business with City Arms.

Once you develop trust you will get the customer service you are looking for.

Remember "Trust goes both ways"

I go nowhere else but City Arms.

This spot was one of the few local coffee shops that was open Labor Day morning in the area so gave it a shot. The woman who worked there was very sweet and clarified my order when I placed it and when she handed it to me. The breakfast sandwiches were huge and worth it in my opinion price wise.

I was disappointed about the fact that for the ice drinks the amount of ice given was so little, but on the plus side that meant I was able to enjoy more of the actual drink vs it be watered down like at Starbucks. It was still cool enough once I stirred the ice around!<//Text>

I ordered a veggie bagel and in return received a bagel with tomatoes and spinach with NO cream cheese. What is a bagel without cream cheese?! I was like OK, the lady must have thought I was vegan? but I ordered a Jalapeno cheese bagel, so no and she could have asked me. I wasn't paying attention when she was making it because I had my 2 year old son with me. Overall, the price was very GOOD. I got my bagel under $3 and gave her a tip because I thought this was a good price. I just would have enjoyed my bagel more with cream cheese.<//text>

This play is simply the best! It's a quaint little coffee shop with excellent service. You can place orders online, over the phone, or just go in and order. Again, the service is awesome. The coffee (mochas, espressos) is delicious. I love this spot!< /text>

This place has very good coffee, I've gotten several beverages from this place but my personal favorite is the chocolate mocha. It has the perfect balance between coffee and chocolate. They've been open during quarantine which is incredibly helpful. Also, they sell face masks/covers which is perfect!!<//Text>

Great local coffee spot with the sweetest owner/barista.   I swap between a mocha and americano when I go, both are great.  Art from local artists is displayed on the wall.  I bought a piece a few years back that I love and in still hanging on my wall.  Pre covid I used to sit and enjoy my coffee with friends/coworkers.  Can’t wait to do that again. Definitely recommend for all coffee lovers!<//text>

Friendly local cafe.  small venue.  displays interesting local artist and local craft work.  live musicians are sometimes found there. laid back and rarely crowded.  the mochas and the mango smoothies made there are recommended.< /Review>

<text>This is one of the best owner operator cafes you can find in the Bay Area. The owner takes time to customize your drink and remembers just how you like it. Frequent the  establishment enough and you’ll a drink waiting for you on your way to work. Talk about customer service. It is a small and cozy cafe but the owner stays connected to community, local artist and musicians by offering her place up to jazz and blues sessions, poetry readings and a monthly rotation of new art from local artist displayed on the walls. Dare I say she makes the best cup of mocha in Hayward.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808f9162acd3da41:0xcdc4bfe342635dc5</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Sure. A friend and I go to Snappy's to chill and relax. A routine after shopping Saturday's farmers market. Spending moments catching up and sharing previous week's agendas. April knows majority of her clientele and Uber Eats drivers she greets everyone entering her quaint cafe.</Review>

It's really nice and affordable, and the coffee is delicious! However, avoid going on sunny mornings-it kinda makes the place an oven, and there's no AC.</Review>

Great coffee, wondrful service. I have passed this place by for years and just happened to stop in last week. So glad I did! and I can't believe it took me so long! Really great atmosphere and all of their workers have been very kind and friendly. Faster(and a little cheaper) than Starbucks and Peet's. My new favorite coffee shop!<//review>

Saw Thai Star on DoorDash and they have high ratings there so decided to get some classic thai noodles for lunch - pad thai and pad see ew. They were both good, can definitely smell and taste the wok char, which is a good thing. They were both delicious but a tad on the sweet side, will be back to try other items< /text>

Most of the food at Thai Stars is ok. We've ordered from them on several occasions, but there has always been at least two items that didn't live up to the quality we expected. As of our most recent meal, we've decided that we're done with them.

The Pad See Ew is pretty good, and the currys are pretty good.  Avoid the Orange Chicken and Sweet & Sour Chicken, as they're poor quality and not worth the price.

We've only kept ordering from them because often, they're the only Thai place that's open for delivery, but from now on, if no other Thai place is available, then we're just just not having Thai food.

One of the items we ordered on our last order (yesterday) was the Red Curry. On all other occasions, the curry was in a good sized container, but this time, it's like the order was halved. We did not order a lunch portion or anything like that. In fact, DoorDash lets you know the date of the last time you ordered a certain item, and I simply re-ordered the same Red Curry as about a month ago. Same item, same price, much smaller portion.

I don't know if they ran out of ingredients or what, but why should I pay the same amount for such a small portion?  If they had to significantly reduce the portion size for some reason, it should be noted on the menu.  We also special ordered it to be "Not Spicy" (Expecting at least less spicy).  The spiciness of Red Curry can easily be controlled, but they sent us the HOTTEST Red Curry I've ever tasted in my entire life. My wife gagged on just a teaspoon full, then I tried it and was pretty shocked at the heat level.  Based on other experiences with this restaurant, we think that maybe they didn't like us asking for the Red Curry to be "Not Spicy" (We know it will be anyway, but we wanted it as mild as possible) so they responded by making it as hot as possible.  We added TWO CANS of Coconut Milk to the Red Curry which made it edible, but it was still very, very hot.  We had to take hardcore antacids to eat a portion.

We won't be back.<//text>

This spot is my preferred one. I visit plenty of restaurants but to this place I go the most. The team is very chummy and the cooking they place on your table is so fresh and tasty. I never decline to have a good meal in this place. Highly recommended.<//text>

I gotta say Thai star is one of the best Thai food I've ever tasted, sure the quantity is small but it is perfect for one person or two because it has enough to eat. I am just one person and I ordered 4 things there and it is really good, I got the Fried shrimp, Shrimp noodles, orange chicken which comes with rice and the last thing I got was  dumpling soup and it is not only good; but it is also helping to sooth my throat and other symptoms of my allergies thanks to the spice. I love the quality and quantity cause even though it is small it is best for sharing, so I give this place five stars and suggest you try it as well cause how will you know if you like it or don't if you don't try it first?!?!!?!!< /Review>

My favorite thai restaurant a hidden gem.
AS OF NOV 1ST 2020 MY rating has lowered. I placed an pick up order and could not make it to the restaurant due to horrible customer service I encountered over the phone. But then I recieve a phone call from the owner saying, " f@#$ you, f@#$". I will never be visiting this restaurant, again.< /Text>

Ordered online this evening. Delivery was 45 min even though we're maybe a mile away. Pad Thai chicken and noodles dry.  I also ordered calamari appetizer.  Less than half of the order was calamari, the rest was battered/fried broccoli!  For $10 I expected calamari, not a battered vegetable.   I was very disappointed.</review>

<Review>Good flavor and good delivery times/prices. Just a couple gripes-their fried appetizers are not that good-don't seem fresh. They didnt pay attention to my special request through grubhub which was a simple request. Also, if you are not a spicy good fan stay away from the curry, even the mild is hot. I like spicy but I wasn't feeling it tonight and ordered "not spicy" and it was still hot.  I do love their brown rice.</Review>< pictures>

Good food at good prices. They also don't have a problem changing ingredients for people with dietary restrictions, which is less common than you might think.<//Review>

<username>Ian Caldwell<//username><text>I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place however the thai food I got was not up to par.... the yellow curry was decent (probably the best part of the meal). The pad thai was super dry and the brown rice tasted dry as well. The price is right, but the food is comparative to the price....... Sorry I can't recommend but I did good customer service.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Very clean friendly and convenient. There's plenty of songs to choose from ranging from country to rock to R&B to rap and pop songs. Not only a great place for family and friends to sit back and enjoy themselves. They allow you to bring in most of anything. Drinking is allowed 21 and over and if you forgot something to drink or eat there's plenty of places inside the building. All in all it's a great place for anyone and everyone to enjoy.< /review>

This place is truly special.

Nick is the best -- friendly and helpful.

Dylan helped me find some CDs for a party I was having.
He rifled through a massive number of CDs to help me find stuff that was so perfect for my party.

If you're the owner, give both of these two amazing folks a raise. They deserve it.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Cerritos Karaoke.
To be honest, the facilities are not the best, but it's a place to go.
Usually there are candy on the counter.

세리토스 노래방.
솔직히 말해서 설비가 최고는 아니지만 갈만한 곳 이예요.
보통 카운터에 사탕이 있어요.< /review>< pictures>

Food was great , service was excellent. Our waiter Enrique was super friendly and very efficient. He took great care of our order, checked on us often and made us feel  very welcome. He was busy but kept coming to our table to be sure we were happy with our order. Outstanding service. Our food was brought out quickly and served hot. Excellent coffee and food. We recommend this place and Enrique.</Text>

The staff are nice and have good customer service too. Sometimes, there is a bit of wait for the food, but that's when they are busy. We don't mind since it's not fast food. Right now, they have outdoor dining available.< /review>< user_id>

Terrible service. Ordered curbside, called MULTIPLE TIMES and no one picked up the phone. Eventually had to walk in, which takes away the entire point of curbside pick up, and found my food had been ready and sitting on an empty table for at least 20 minutes. When I got my food, they seemed annoyed that I came in to pick it up.
I was respectful and polite the entire time because I've worked so long in customer service, but at some point it becomes unacceptable. I am extremely disappointed.
Edit to add- when we informed the manager that the ringer on their phone was off, she was incredibly disrespectful and rude. They advertise curbside side pick up but turn the their phone and are horribly rude<//Text>

Don't bother ordering curb side. We called to let them know we were here and no one answered. So I went inside and food wasn't ready, so while I was waiting I called to see if they even had a phone on. Yea, a red light flashes, but the ringer is off. I told them "hey your ringer is off" and all I got was a shrug and "sorry". If you're trying to avoid going into places during covid, just avoid this one too.<//Review>

The only reason why I am giving a 1 star review for this Ihop, because they denied me and my party of 2, access. Because they wanted proof that our animals were registered as service animals. And in this state of California, we’re not allowed to have our pets in our cars and we’re allowed to have them with us. So, I will never be going back to this location. Thank you.</Text>

< Review>
Typical IHOP restaurant.
They sell pancakes and a few other American breakfast staples.

The bad: This location is sub standard. Service isn't great, waited 25 minutes for pancakes. Received coffee but no silverware until the food came out.
Mostly cold food but it was standard quality. The menu price is also slightly higher than other locations. Homeless asking for money in the parking lot.
Overall I would not recommend it.</Review>

IHOP is classic! This location is right off the highway heading east from San Diego. There are so many options to satisfy any palette; whether you’re looking for sweet or savory food. You also have options between breakfast and lunch items not to mention a kids menus and a 55+ menu. This location seems a bit older and they mostly have booths. I think I saw only one table that was half booth half chairs so doesn’t really seem accessible for handicapped people. Otherwise we had a pleasant experience and enjoyed the food.< /Text>

This was my first visit to this IHOP in about a year. The service was excellent the waitress was a delight and food was served hot in a packed section. The food was awesome and prepared as ordered. So much better than the last time I was there. I thought I'd never return but after this visit I'll be back. If it is this good next time I'll change rating to 5 stars.<//review>

Perhaps it was the timing I chose (Saturday morning around 11) but it was very packed and busy. Parking was scarce and there werent many available tables (2). Other than that I enjoyed the meal, and the waiters did good as well.< /Text>

Seems like they rotate through employees fast, always someone new working. If you don't mind waiting a little extra, patience never hurt anyone. Food is always great been here a handful of times.< /review>

I usually don't frequent this IHOP. It seems to be one of the busier ones in San Diego County. Right off of the 94 freeway. This visit didn't go so well. Might have been because of the time change. Took a while to get seated. Food took even longer. Mom's eggs were not cooked. The clear was still visible and runny. Not my first choice for a IHOP. Slower times seem better.</Text>

For the price you could hit a locally owned spot and it would be much better. In the morning the service is pretty spotty. In my last visit I got more help from people who weren't my waiter than I did from him. For a long time it seemed like he left.<//Review></record>

We were here after 10:30pm but the staff were energetic and friendly and our food came quick. It was delicious and when we were leaving we had a lovely conversation with the hostess, Karla. She was extremely talkative and kind and treated my dad and I like close friends while we were paying the bill. If I lived here I would frequent this place for sure.</Text>

< Review>
Been here a couple times for take out. The parking lot is always really packed so I just want to get in and out. My main issue is when grabbing food for pick up.  They tell you food is ready at a particular time but you always end up waiting way after the fact.  I understand being busy on weekends or dinner rushes but I came here on a weekday and this place was dead. Save your money and get your food somewhere else.<//Review>

I believe I ordered a garden omelette. I don't care for mushrooms so I asked if they can replace it with green peppers & onions & the waiter did not hesitate. I was pleased with the portion & like always loved their pancakes! What I don't like is that it's a bit on the expensive side. Almost $13 for the order.</review>

The waitress was really nice to us, but the food wasn't great. The last two times that I have visited this restaurant, It's taken forever, just to get our food, everything was cold and nothing like It looked in the menu. I'm not sure I want to go back.<//Text>

My husband and I went out for something to eat and decided to try IHOP on Spring Street. To our surprise we ate the BEST Classic with bacon steak burger ever!! It was clean, roomy, busy and restrooms were also clean! Our server Chavela was very nice, outgoing and checked on us a few times for FREE soda refills and had a delightful personality who really cared about her customers! I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS IHOP!!< /text>

<Review>The place is clean and the booths and tables are well arranged as to where you can have a moderate amount of privacy.
We got there around 9 at night and there seemed to be only two waitresses for the whole restaurant, so it took a while to receive the menus and for our order to be placed.
Our food took close to 40 minutes to arrive, but our server was very sorry for the delay since we pointed out that several other parties that had arrived after we did had received their orders already. Because of this, we received a discount on the check total.
Food and coffee were great. I had the grilled chicken breast and I recommend it.</Review>< Pics>

<text>the host didn't even seat us or give us menus let alone make effort to... But some girls enter he was out giving menus all of sudden however the young lady who took care of my family was amazing making a dozen shakes clearly under staff but still maintain exceptional service. She is the only reason I'm giving a 4 star rating because she never once complain just kept a positive can do attitude advising me it was going to be a few extra minutes for our food. Awesome waitress just needs  better team mates<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I ordered a $15 dollar steak with some scrambled eggs on the side and fruits. Let me start by saying that the steak was dry, and quite chewy, the eggs were very dry and the fruits were OBVIOUSLY canned fruits instead of fresh fruits :( so sad to see a very popular restaurant serving bad cooked food.< /review><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d95734fcc8613b:0x1cdb6918f87d0666< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Stick to pancakes. I tried the classic burger w/bacon. Angus beef patty had good flavor but it's not enough to compete with burger places. Service was slow, refills on fries and tea took a long time. The place was pretty empty. Won't be going back anytime soon.</Review>

<text>love that this location is open 24 hours a day. Same food as any other IHOP but it was tasty and reasonably priced. Have the Grinch pancake special but actually like the cinnamon roll pancakes on a previous visit better.< /text>< Pics>

I had a great server named Alex. He was very helpful and attentive.  The food was great . The hashbrowns were cooked perfectly and the ham was tasty.  The prices are a bit higher than some places, but the amount of food on eat plate is plenty.<//text>

< Review>
I called to place an order. A female answered and asked if I could "hold please." I said sure. She then placed the phone down on the counter. After hearing the transactions of 3 different customers paying their bill it went quiet. After about 10mins I asked if she was still there, but had no response.</Review>

There was a waitress who went above and beyond for my loved one.  He is a below the knee amputee and the nursing home through him out on the street. It was hours until I could get there and she was really kind to him while he waited there. We will never forget her kindness< /Text>

<review>Came here and asked for my favorite dish since I didn't see it on the menu.  I was told by the waitress that she would ask since she was new.  Waited with my wife for a good 15 minutes as I watched her take other people's orders who came in behind me.  We left.< /review>< Pics>

Service is hit or miss, but always polite and accommodating. Military discount is a plus. There are some resident feral homeless around the place that can be a nuisance (I've Had to intercede & escort them to the door myself on 2 occasions) but not often. all in all I'm always pleased.

<review>The restaurant can get packed first of all plus the parking is a bit of a nightmare. If you are going there during popular hours, please be prepared you'll be waiting. The food is what the chain offers. The services are decent. My only thing was I found bugs crawling around the window area at where I sat. I didn't notice them until my son was squashing them for fun.< /review><user>113911870312542284056</user><GmapID>0x80d95734fcc8613b:0x1cdb6918f87d0666</GmapID>< Pictures>

Great place to get some comfort food. Brief wait during peak times like Sunday morning. But got seated quickly. Darlene was our server and was friendly, fun, and a joy to have. Food was fresh, warm, and nicely presented. We were craving pumpkin pancakes and IHOP delivered!</review>

Nice and clean atmosphere. Ordered online and food wasn't ready yet, I understand there is waits, but I would have waited almost 40 mins for my food if I had sat down and ate at the restaurant.<//Text>

<review>Well what can I say about THIS IHop that hasn't already been said about Grandma's sweet potato pie... The service here was second to none. Now I must let y'all know this wasn't my first time experiencing there A1 service. I've eaten here several times and it's pretty much always the same. Hands down great customer service.

This IHOP has some really good pancakes. The only problem I have with this IHOP is that there's only one server. You could be waiting for pancake syrup, coffee or even soda for quite a while. Me and my wife waited for 7 minutes for me to get a refill on my coffee.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Food was ok. Ordered a bowl of Oatmeal was like a couple bucks and asked them if they had raisins (Nope) but we have banana, blueberries and strawberries.  I said oh good. So it came with a couple of each. Unknowingly to me each item cost me a buck a piece totally 6 bucks for a small bowl of oats. Needless to say Waiter forfeited his tip entirely.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80d95734fcc8613b:0x1cdb6918f87d0666<//gmap_id><user_name>Paul R.S.</user_name>< Response>

<text>This is the closest midnight breakfast place to me on Saturdays and every single night I've visited they are not prepared for the 2am rush. They are understaffed and overwhelmed and act as though they are surprised there is a rush again at this time. My experiences here have consisted of receiving poorly cooked food, incredibly slow service and getting attitude from the staff. On the rare occasion I come here during daylight hours they are able to handle many more guests without any hassle. I gave two stars because I know the service can be better at times, yet when I come here the experience has been very poor. I would recommend the Dennys across the street if not for the thefts that have taken place there.<//text>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><review>The worst service of any restaurant I've ever been to. And, the service is consistently bad. I wanted to try their new Burgers that they have been advertising.  I went the other day at 3pm. Only one other person there at the time. I waited for an employee to come up front and seat me. I waited another five minutes for water and another five minutes for a waitress. I ordered a burger.  I didn't see anyone for 45 minutes so I left.
I returned today at 2pm. Exactly the same situation. I left and went next door to Wendy's.
This place is only 2 miles from my house. I won't be returning.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

There has always been something on the menu to catch my attention. This time it was a "55+ Special."
I had a short stack of French toast with a scrambled egg and cheese side order.
I left satiated and ready to begin my day.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>Why is it that when you go into a 24 hour restaurant at 3:00am they act like they have never seen people out at that hour before? It’s after a  Saturday night! People like to get food after being out that late. This is the second time in 2 weeks that a few of us went there and there was only 1 server working. And you can’t sit down over there because the busboy already cleaned it. So the busboy decides where customers can sit? And it shouldn’t take a freaking hour to get your food. Walked in the place at 3, plates hit the table at 4. And finally, your cook sucks. Over cooked steak, under cooked eggs, cold pancakes, and bacon that was not only burnt, but greasy too. And good luck on getting any type of coffee or ice tea refill.  Late night Chinese food is sounding better and better.</Text>< pics>

<text>At the time we went, it was fairly busy.  It took no time at all to be seated, but then to twenty minutes to get a menu. It took only ten more minutes too get the food, and it was good.  So the only problem was the time it took to be waited upon.<//text><response>None</response>< Rating>

Horrible service. Not only did our waitress suck and was to preoccupied talking to the busboy, I ended up paying $17 for an omelet that tasted like crusty eggs. Will not be going to Ihop anytime soon if even ever.< /text>

We tried the IHOP in La Mesa, on Spring Street. The Breakfast Sampler and Split Decision were both delicious!! The server Chavela was very nice and attentive.  She checked on us a few more times after we got our food, making sure we had everthing we needed and refilled our drinks as well.
OUTSTANDING service, GREAT FOOD just ask for CHAVELA if you want excellent service!!<//Review>

Went in earlier this evening to order take out and it was pleasantly unbusy.
Placed and paid for my 4-meal order and in reasonable course was brought two nicely full bags.
Naively on my part, I didn't check the received order which was missing a $10.29 pancake order.
Note that while I was there waiting for my order, at least one incoming call was answered.
After not getting through to a real person 3 times over about a 15-minute span, I left a message.  That message has not yet been replied to as promised by the answer bot.
A fourth attempt to get through after about 2 hours also failed and my attempt to reach a live person at the Rancho San Diego IHOP also failed.<//text>

Interesting had never been to an Ihop before, but the waiters all knew what they were doing and considering that I went of Christmas the place was packed, very in tune staff.
They have some nice scenery on the inside, although to get to the location by car is a little odd.</text>

Actually really good food, would definitely go again. Some sketchy people walking around outside but it was a little later in the day, good service though.</Review>

< Review>
The waitress' are excellent but the management of this establishment need to be replaced. Maybe even the cooks too, my order along with my sisters was made wrong, and was replaced with another wrong dish. I finally just said screw it. Breyanna and Chevela handled things great and were very nice and gladly helped us out. They are new employees so shame on IHOP for leaving them alone on a busy night. It seems everytime we eat here there's only one cook or they are severely short staffed. FIX YOUR MANAGEMENT!< /Review>

I use to work here until i was diagnosed with cancer and eventually they fired me.  The gm maurillio valles is extremely racist.  If your not latino you dont get any good shifts or barely any hours at that.  They really did me wrong after having cancer and getting the surgery i came back to work only to go from working 40 plus hours a week to not even 12 hours a week. I became homeless due to the huge cut in hours.  Dont support this evil place and these evil people anyone who could do that to someone who was a loyal employee for almost 2 years is not right in the head.  Boycott< /Text>

I've been coming here for a long time now. My family and I usually make late night trips here after a long day. They are always friendly and most of the staff knows us. The service is always great and the food is good too. We have never had a problem here in all the time we've been going there. It gets packed on the weekends especially in the morning but they always seem to find seating for everyone. The serving sizes can be a bit small if you order the specials. But other thank that it is a cozy little neighborhood diner that isn't like other IHOPs I've been to.</text>

<review>Use to go to this resturant alot. Then one late night took my restless kids out just because it was close and we where hungry and bored. The food made me and the children completely ill. Day service had always been a pleasant experience. The food great and service even better. Have not returned in almost 6 years. That one bad experience is just something I can not shake.< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>ASK FOR MONICA!!

For a great breakfast 5 star experience ask to be seated in one of the tables that  Monica is waiting on!
If you are lucky enough to sit in Monica's tables she's waiting then your experience will be a 5 star experience if not then 4 or lower and here is why:
She brings you warm food
Cold/hot beverages promptly
Condiments on demand
And most importantly she discreetly asks if you would like dessert if you have kids with you.

Ohhh and your re-fills are almost immediate.

She recommends good meals when you don't know what to eat, or drinks when you don't know what to drink!

So ask for Monica... if she's not there then sorry but it's 4 stars for you.

Ohh yeah she's nice and she's single.<//Text>< Pics>

extremely slow service, it was busy did have to give some slack there, but the busy didn't explain just how slow the server was.... once he brought it food we didn't see him again,  we finally had to get up and go to the register without a check,  and we waited a long while after finishing food to do that< /text>

<user_id>109743347029069443194<//user_id><review>no bueno. poor service. and 3 months ago i said the same. tbis place took well over an hour to get the food out. i went to the wendys next door, ate, and returned. all of this so i could come back and have my bill amended when the food finally arrived.

STAY AWAY. DANGER WILL ROBINSON.<//review>< Pics>
