<text>Their new system is extremely inconvenient. You have to go and wait in line for a ticket, for a time window later in the day. What?????? It's a Goodwill store. You have to wait in line for tickets, then wait in line again when it is your ticket time. They say during that time that they will not remove bins, but that is not true. There was still an hour left in my session, and they were removing bins. Not a good vibe coming from the employees......<//text>< pics>

<GmapID>0x80c35356bb2c859d:0x9092025f05579770< /GmapID><Review>I love goodwill stores so I was excited to try this place out. noticed someone wasn’t let in and thought the place was closed. Turns out they are the strictest goodwill for COVID. They don’t let anyone under 12 in. They don’t allow you to shop with the person your with and demand you to maintain the minimum 6ft. It didn’t seem so bad at first but the way they let people in is a joke. They say only 40 people are allowed in but I counted more than 50 once I was inside. They make it difficult for customers to shop by literally taking bins that you’re looking at without notice. More than 30 people were just standing around waiting for them to bring in more bins. If you can travel to this goodwill, I recommend you travel to another.< /Review>< name>

People would leave the shopping carts on the side of the walls instead of keeping it to themselves and would complain if someone would brag something from that cart. Keep it with you at all times. Don’t have to worry about your cart missing.< /Text>

I’m pretty sure they deleted my review and if they keep on deleting it i will write more bad reviews. MY SISTER DROVE 40 minutes to the goodwill bins and we knew the rules were 12 and up,so we told them we were 12 Bc me and my twin brother are 12 and they told us that twins are the same height wich is not true he’s 4’9and I’m 5’0  I hope the manager who tried to convince us we are not twins has a HORIBBLE DAY BC YOU RUINED ME AND MY BROTHERS DAY.muah xoxo 🥰< /review>

<text>Terrible! They don't allow kinds under 12 inside and they claim only 40 people allowed in the store at one time but didn't allow me and my husband inside saying there was only room for one person cuz they had one cart. We insisted that we didn't need more than one cart but they didn't allow us in and had to bring a manager out who just gave us the same run around BS. When going inside we counted and there was 52 people inside. They then proceeded to follow us around and wouldn't let  me and my husband be within 6ft of each other even tho other couples were walking around together. That's just straight up harassment.

Im honestlt just ticked off i drove her with my newborn and 2 older kids in tow on an extremely hot day to find out they dont allow anyone under 12 in.they have a sign outside the window. It mentions nothing of this on gheir website. I have frequented  outlet goodwills for my business  while i was pregnant  and daughters at school.covid took my part time job away and now i cant even continue my full time.everything is hard as it is.for goodwill to make it harder on parents.</Review>

I have to say I love this place. I find the staff very nice and informative. One complaint I have is when we first started going the aisles were clear and people kept their carts along the walls. Recently it has changed with people taking the carts with them so they can scoop more I don't know why. The reason I have a problem with this is because I am in a mobility scooter and all the carts block any access for me.  I have to go way around and sometimes I can't even get close to the bins. I don't mind waiting but now they are leaving their carts while going to other bins. This is not just inconvenient for me but dangerous should we need to get out quickly. I would like it to be like it was before with the carts at the walls. Other than one complaint I think the place is great.< /text>

The set up is much like an all you can eat buffet with all the food mixed together. Bins are set out with items in them. You search the bins for what you are looking for. It's a good idea to know what your looking for or it can be a bit overwhelming. Most of the items are less than two dollars a pound and are categorized as textiles and hard. Bring your own bags to store your selections just in case there are no carts available. When you're ready to checkout, they weigh & you pay.<//text>

Enjoyed buying by pound. When I visited the pound was $1.79. They only weighted the light items and the heavier items like coats and jeans were in a separated cart that wasn't on the scale so I'm not certain how she got the price of those items, I'm guessing it was by piece. Anyhow the place is clean and wasn't too crowded. Got a bunch of good items but you have to fish them bin by bin. Was a good arm workout for sure! Spent 3 hours in there and felt like 30 minutes!</text>

Really really cheap clothes. They sell them by the pound, the only draw back is that they are not hanging on a rack, they are all in great big pyles and you have to go through them. Lots of good stuff there!!!!!< /Text>

Yesterday I went to this store and something happened that caused me a lot of indignation because I was a young man and buying just like everyone who goes there and a manager came out and started screaming just because he had touched a piece of clothing before everyone does it, It is ok if there are rules but the act was bad and then I asked him to take off the headphones or if he did not take it out, the place was very arrogant that they all have work for us that we bought there. Then the secury ladie screaming too!!!! They need to improve that and better we all people<//Review>

Affordable pricing and they charge you by the pound of stuff you have in your basket. Best place to come to early in the morning to get a great deal by the pound.</Text>

< Review>
This is a WEIRD Goodwill.
Items are bought by weight if I remember correctly.
Items are all in rolling tubs with no rhyme or reason to why they are there.
EX. Purses and shoes in with toys ect.

I believe items purchased are payed for my the pound. If you're looking for a lot for very very little this is your place.

Bring gloves, as everything is filthy, and comfortable shoes as it's going to take A LOT of looking to find something good.</Review>

People take their discount seriously here. You pay by the pound and be prepared to search through bins. There's a long line because they only have one cashier at a time. It was kind of strange to see people lining up for the new Bins to come out.<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>It was a good store could get nice thing but now it's more of an auction house then anything else. They keep the good stuff for the auctions and only put broke and dirty clothes out for the store. And if there is anything good you will be asalted from outher customer in order for them to take it from you. If you go you do need to whatch your cart becouse it your stuff will go missing .<//review>< date>

Compared to the outlet in orange county, this one is smaller but cleaner. The lb cost 1.49 in orange is 2.49. They mostly.have clothes bins but a few toy and houseware bins. If you dig you can get some good things. They dont have a huge furniture section but the stuff they do have is priced reasonable. I would go back every week if i could. The grand opening was july 11 2013 ....and hopefully they keep it open and always nice ...unlike.the crap they sell at.other shops.<//text>

Its Not a organized place and they just hired their prices from $1.49lb to $1.99lb. They charge by weight. But for pillows ect. items they charge you$2. They have very used , donated thing's. I go for curtains, rugs, and toy's.</Review>

<Review>Dr. Bhatnagar is great and amazing, I chose the best OB to looked throughout my pregnancy journey. She goes above and beyond. I was impressed and satisfied with the level of her service I experienced very warm and caring. She listened to my questions/concerns and answered with great information. Staff was extremely kind, helpful and welcoming. Office are clean and organized. It’s highly recommended.<//Review><date>1621144583834</date><GmapID>0x80dcddb55570e5c5:0x774522b08d58c2c<//GmapID><name>Bellarose Michelle Alvarez< /name><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

She examined me and while she was doing it, she explained everything perfectly and provided all necessary options of treatments so I could understand, and make decision. I am so happy to find her, and the most important thing is I know she is not thinking about the business part of medical treatments and she wants the best for her patients ,so I trust her and I highly suggest her to all who are looking for a caring, knowledgeable, and ethical physician.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate><gmap_id>0x80dcddb55570e5c5:0x774522b08d58c2c<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

She is so knowledgeable and so comforting , She is the 2nd OB that I’ve ever had in my life that I instantly felt like she completely understood what is going on with my body and to have a solution.
I’m 51 years old and have had several OB’s in my life time, and there has only now been 2 that I felt completely confident with . The first one retired years ago. But now I have found another . Thank you Dr. Bhatnagar for your kindness and care .< /Review>

<Review>I'd leave a 0 star if I could. Take a look at the YELP reviews, I've never seen so many bad ones about a doctor.

I'm pregnant and in the middle of my pregnancy I'm feeling forced to change my obgyn because of how bad was my eperince with Dr. Bhatnagar and all of her staff.

They are rude, secretary and nurse do not speak good English. They trick you in charging you for prenatal visits and they try to make everything hard for you. For example, I had an ultrasound done and they did not want to share my results on the portal. I could not go there because I was in bed rest due to a bleeding and asked my husband to pick it up for me, when he got there they refused to give it to him and I had to call the office again and the girl pretended she did not understand his request and finally gave him the results.

Not only that, the doctor has THE WORST BEDSIDE MANNERS and also NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE at all!!! She does not go over the results with you, I felt like I needed constantly to be checking on google to know what was going on with my results and then ask her and then she would say,... oh yea, this was low... oh yeah this is out of range...

I had a bleeding after 2 days of fever with covid and she told me over the phone that I had miscarriage for sure and that I should go to the nearest hospital to do a D & C, I panicked and cried so hard, once I got there the baby WAS FINE! she could have said that I should  go to an emergency room due to protocol and have myself checked. After I called her and she said "How a pregnant woman let herself get COVID" well, I was astonished and did not answer her but I should have said, well, we are in a pandemic! She did not want me to take back to the office, even tho I continued have bleeding for 3 weeks and more than 2 weeks had passed since my symptoms.

There are so many many stories that I could say here but I think should give you some idea.

She is just money oriented and does not care about patients at all!

Do yourself a favor and don't go to her office! It will be a terrible experience! I should have looked at the YELP reviews first before looking at the convenience of been the only OBGYN near me.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

0 stars.
1. The assistant doesn't understand/speak English well and has no medical knowledge what so ever. I wrote down that my mother is a breast cancer SURVIVOR and she asked "your mother still alive?"
2. The soap in the examination room was filled with water so I'm sure it didn't disinfect (while we're in a worldwide pandemic)
3. The doctor has no compassion, people skills, or patience. She didn't make eye contact once and I felt completely violated during my yearly examination. She didn't provide any medical knowledge to me - most likely because she doesn't have any. All the medical equipment used was from the 90's- early 00's so everything hurt much more than necessary and probably isn't the most effective.<//Text>

I can not state this strongly enough- DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go to near this "Dr"! I wish I would have given her negative reviews more consideration before subjecting myself to the absolute WORST experienceI have ever had with a Dr. But I was desperate to get a surgical consult and my insurance only covered 2 female drs in my area.

The first one had good reviews but she was difficult to get into. The second was Dr. Bhatnagar, who had many bad reviews, but was available quickly. Unfortunately,  my pain and desperation made me disregard those bad reviews and I am kicking myself for not running out of her office when I had the chance.

The office itself was so gross, and outdated without any proper medical equipment. Everything was truthfully from the 90s or early 2000s. I brought in a CD of my MRI so she could see the problem, and they said they didn't have the equipment to open it. What??? It felt like a free clinic in a 3rd world nation rather than the office of a supposedly well recognized OBGYN in Irvine.

The nurse who took my vitals wouldn't leave the room to allow me to change. She said if I wanted privacy I could go down the hall to the bathroom. Well, they didn't even give me a paper gown to cover myself, only a stained, gross piece of fabric the size of a tea towel to cover me. So I wasn't going to walk down the hall naked. I should have walked out at that point, and I will forever be mad at myself for not doing so.

Then when the "Dr" came in, she was as rude as others have stated. She looked at my pregnancy history and asked me why I had 6 miscarriages, as though I had something to do with that. She said many other rude things and treated me as though I was stupid for having gone to the hospital for the issue that brought me to her office.

Then she examined me so roughly that I almost cried. And she had her nurse hold my legs apart aggressively while she did a procedure I did not ask her to do and I'm not sure she was even qualified to do. I felt so violated and ashamed for allowing it to happen but it happened so quickly and I think I was in partial shock.

After the "exam" they left the room without giving me anything to clean up with. There were no towels or tissues, and I wasn't about to use the stained cloth they gave me to cover with. So I had to get dressed with all of the blood and goo all over me. I didn't even want to be in that office for another second to use their bathroom, so I ran out as fast as I could. I felt so dirty when I got home that I showered for 15 minutes,  just doing my best to wash the memory of that ordeal off of me.

I am still trying to process what happened to me, and why I allowed it to happen. The best I can come up with is that I didn't want to burn a bridge with her in case she was my only option for surgery. I know that sounds ridiculous,  but  I was  dealing with a lot of pain and fear from my medical issue, and just wanted to get treatment for it as soon as possible. But now I am also now living with fear that what she did during the exam may have caused more damage that might negatively impact me later.

Please, please, if you have read this far, I implore you to steer clear of this "Dr". I honestly don't know how she gets any repeat patients or how she hasn't lost her license. All I can think is that her patients might be young or inexperienced with modern medicine and don't know how a gynecologist is supposed to behave. My husband and I are compiling a complaint to send to the Medical Board, and our insurance company about her. Her behavior goes way beyond not having a good "bedside manner". That is something I can overlook in a doctor if I feel they are competent. I'm not sure if she is incompetent or if she just doesn't care about her patients well being. In any regard, she should not be taking care of any woman, especially  women who are already in a very sensitive and vulnerable state, looking for a woman doctor they can trust. She is not that "Dr".<//Review>

<Text>Extremely knowledgeable. Answered all of my questions. She is always warm and kind and very gentle. She explained everything she was doing down to the very last dot. Left all my appointments satisfied and with all my questions answered. I also saw Vanessa the NP. She is also very knowledgeable. I love how they work hand in hand and how Dr. Bhatnagar was always involved in my care, even when I saw Vanessa. Just goes to show you how truly passionate she is about her patients and the care that they receive. She also helped with a family member going through cancer. Gave us the best advice and so much moral support. She is the best doctor hands down. I fully recommended her. You will not be disappointed.</Text><user_name>Rocio Ayala<//user_name>< time>

ALERT!

Absolutely horrible! If I can leave a 0 I would!
From beginning to the end. As you walk the office smells unwelcoming. Secondly, we were never greeted with a smile not even a “Hello”. The middle eastern lady at the front desk was extremely rude. Sorry to say that she did not even speak very well English. We also noticed that she was a bit lost and seemed to be a new employee. After waiting 15 minutes, we were taken into the office by the Nurse (Asian lady) that we could not understand a word... it was so stressful and disappointing to my wife, specially because we have a baby on the way. On top of that, the nurse was yelling and upset because we kept questioning her. After a while, Dr. B arrived. Overall, it was a horrible experience. To improve, you must probably train your staff.

PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS OB!!!!!</Text>

When I went into the office I was meant to have an appointment with the DOCTOR but instead the nurse measured my height and weight ONLY and then had the audacity to schedule another appointment for a month later. I had an appointment with the doctor and when I arrived the didn’t even tell me the doctor was gone I asked that myself. all they did was apologize which was pointless.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

New patient would not come back to this office. The doctors demeanor was very cold, un professional and not compassionate at all and said I was asking too  many questions. My mother has a history of ovarian cancer And grandmother breast cancer. Medical assistant was so rude also told me not to place my purse on the counter in a rude tone of voice Called office to get my lab results had me on hold for a long long time and never came back on the line. Called back kept on putting me on hold for very long time. Office had a cold feeling when I was there . I would never  go  back.</Text>

<review>I want to give NO star to this doctor. What an unprofessional behavior! On appointment day, when I reached there, the nurse did my whole check up but doctor DIDN’T SHOW UP AT ALL. I didn’t get the cause or solution to my problem.Ridiculous! Then they charged me heavy bill also. Finally, I went to another Gynecologist for treatment.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Imagine going to the hospital, the nerves and excitement of your first kid being born. And then your doctor shows up, looks at some papers and goes “uh oh....this is not good....<remains silent until we ask her what that means>” I mean talk about stressful!
The entire pregnancy was like this, constant anxiety caused by poor communication, unfriendly personality, worst bedside manners, lack of connecting with us as people. the nurse was very hard to understand due to language barrier but was  very polite. The front desk was poor, we would get charged twice sometimes, and that was another hassle my wife had to deal with. We have had other friends with similar experiences, just avoid this place at all costs. The grass is certainly greener on the other side!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>INCOMPETANT DOCTOR! Do youself a favor & find a real OBGYN. She should have her license taken away! My special-needs neice was in her care for the last 7 years. The main focus for her care was to keep her on steady birth control so she won't get pregnant, as it could be life-threatening to herself & baby. My niece went for an exam, complaining of stomach pain. Doctor gave her a physical exam & found nothing. No pregnancy test given, even though my neice asked (doctor said to get a home-kit), however, she did give her a Depo Provera shot for some strange reason. Ultrasound was ordered, and SURPRISE! My niece is 7 MONTHS PREGNANT! This doctor could not even find a 7 MONTH OLD BABY inside a 140 pound, 30 year old! She has not had one ounce of prenatal care this entire time.THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN & TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! We are now praying for a miracle! She is nothing short of a quack! We are reporting her to the proper authorities.< /review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<Text>This is the most unprofessional doctor I have ever had. The staff was friendly and kind but Lara was not caring at all. I went in to ask about birth control, not only she turned me away to go to Planned Parenthood, she also had her back to me when I would talk to her. She would ask me twice what I was asking her and not make eye contact. You would think female doctors are more compassionate.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is Wafaa Hasan One of Dr. Lara’s patients, I highly recommend Dr. Bhatnagar G Lara She is an excellent, caring, kind & smart doctor I had problem with heavy periods, She did a procedure for me called endometrial ablation & that helped to reduce my heavy periods I went to couple doctors before her & the only solution they had is the removal of my uterus ( hestrectomy). She is the only one who suggested to find other solution rather than hestrectomy . I am so happy now & comfortable I found such a great doctor. Also I must mention her stuff are so nice & friendly.
Dr. Lara dserves 5 stars

The worst experience ever. Complete and utter disconnect with patents.  A doctor that is rude and condescending is not my idea of a good doctor. My daughter never wants to go back after how uncomfortable she makes her feel. She is now holding daughters birth control ransom until she comes in for a visit. Understandable if it was an annual pap or something but after a few months of usining now u will not refill? Nearest appt is 2 weeks away. This helps tremendously. Do yourself a favor and stay far far away from the worse dr in Irvine, Orange County and possibly all of California.</Text>

<Review>Dr. Bhatnagar delivered my youngest baby. If you want a doctor that is going to deliver your child with out any issue Dr. Bhatnagar is the doctor. She doesnt have much personality. When problems start happening im not looking for a doctor I like. Im looking for a doctor that gets the job done. Thats Dr. Bhatnagar. She also did my wifes surgery. Once again flawless. Thank you Dr. Bhatnagar.< /Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Horrible place.  I saw Dr. G. Lara Bhatnagar and told her I was having a lot of pain due to endometriosis.  She said she could do a laparoscopy, which I have had previously and does help.  When I called to find out about scheduling I kept being told I was getting a call back and excuses.  I called every week for 6 weeks.  Even told the receptionist to please call back because I was in pain. She promised and never did.  I don't think the doctor knows anything about endometriosis and didn't have the courtesy to just admit it so I could get help elsewhere.  I already found another doctor but this is a very unhelpful and uncaring office< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Horrible !!!!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR !!!! I wouldn't even give her 1 star
I have just moved to California and I needed a new doctor. So I searched the Internet and found her, very close to where I live and the website seemed ok so I wanted to give it a try.

First of all, when i first arrived, I was surprised how empty the clinic was. Usually the OB/GYN clinics are full of people waiting. This clinic was empty not a single patient and so dull and unpleasant. I did not want to judge it from he beginning so I went on.
The nurse took me to the tiny room and started taking notes. She can barely understand English and it was clear that she had no medical background. I clearly said I had Preeclampsia twice during my 2 pregnancies, and she seemed so confused and started looking for the name in her drop down list. I even asked her if she needed the spelling but she said no need (maybe she just decided to skip this information, which was the most important of all)
Anyway, I waited for the doctor"undressed" in the room for 45 minutes and I could hear her chatting on the phone in her native language for 45 minutes !!!!!
She finally came and she was reading the notes and seemed very inconfident. She prescribed me a hormone medicine to take to get my irregular period and then another one once i get it.
I started taking the first one, and started bleeding from my nose every single day( one day i woke up with blood all over the pillow and my face!!!). My blood pressure was going extremely high, and I started getting severe headaches. long story short, we had to call 911 and the ambulance came, and then went to the ER they suspected I had a stroke, or bleeding in my brain because of the medicine.
She was lazy and careless and did not pay attention to the details of my case and gave me a medicine that shouldn't be given to a preeclamic patient.

I called the office and told the receptionist the story, she said the doctor would call me back within an hour(that was on Friday) I kept waiting, she called me on Tuesday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
she acted as if she knew nothing, she said i didn't understand the message (as if this is an excuse for her not calling back for 4 days!!!!
She lied a lot, she said she didn't receive the ultrasound from the lab, then she said the ultrasound looked good. she kept bulls*****ing me trying to say that the problem is how my body reacted and not what she did. and guess what, she said maybe next time I will give you double the dose for your body to react to the medicine !!!!!!! as if i am stupid enough to go to her again and take any medicine she would prescribe to kill me. I eventually called in again and cancelled previously set follow up appointment.

I cant believe they call this careless liar a doctor. no wonder why her clinic was empty..<//review>

<review>Let me explain my experience:-

I am glad to have Dr Bhatnager as my OB and her staff was extremely nice to me. When I was at 17 weeks, I lost my mucus plug and I was very worried about preterm labor. Doctor took special care and every week she kept me under ultrasound monitoring to measure my cervical length, the ultrasound technician ( Deby ) was very experienced and very kind to me. At some point of time ( around mid of 17th week ) I started having heavy vaginal discharge,  I thought of going for "cerclage" procedure but my doctor explained me the demerits of the cerclage procedure and she wants to use this as a last resort. she advised me to take lots of rest and gave me some tips on how to be very careful. Under her care and guidance I  safely entered my 39th week of pregnancy.

For labor I went to HOAG Newport, it was a normal vaginal delivery and I was in active labor for 3-4 hours. Then I delivered a wonderful baby boy.  But my real problem started right after I delivered baby- I started bleeding heavily and my uterus did not compressed back, as a result I lost about 4 liters of blood in around 10 to 20 minutes and my blood pressure went really high and my oxygen levels dropped. its a moment I was very close to death. Dr. Bhatnager and her emergency team at Hoag had to rapidly perform a complex procedures on me to save my life. During  the procedure I was transfused with about 14 units of blood (4.2 liters) and other blood components like platelets with in 30 min using special highly advanced equipments. Just imagine How critical i was in. Had Dr. Bhatnager not rushed and took appropriate measures i might have gone by now. I was in ICU for about 48hrs and then moved to OB ward for 3 days. Due to all these complications with my health, my baby stayed in nursery for 3 days. I am very thankful for Hoag nursery team. They took very good care of my little boy. During all these procedure and my recovery time doctor prescribed me very safe medications, which did not harmed my lactation. She also gave lots of moral support to me and my family members. Which really helped to stay hopeful and recover faster. Now I am a happy Mom with two beautiful boys.

Overall my opinion about Dr. Bhatnager - very supportive, Kind, time sensitive, highly experienced to handle complex situations. She is an amazing doctor. I am glad that I selected Dr Bhatnager as my OB.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I have been to so many fabric stores over the past couple of months and this store was the super friendliest a d the most helpful. From the moment I walked it, I was greeted hello and was asked how they could help. They called John over and showed him a photo of what I am looking for. They didn't have it but it as it is a super old fabric however, John showed me some other alternatives and I left with four ideas. Kay then helped me pick out some the things needed and she was so friendly and she too gave me some other ideas as well. Kay even handled my checkout and I thanked her so much for all her assistance. I do hope one of these samples work because I definitely would love to give place more business.

Thank you!<//Review>

Unprofessional staff with no customer service skills! Was in the store for 30mins browsing and was never asked by any of the many employees if I needed help!  Teach your staff to be welcoming and helpful to paying customers! Be happy that people are shopping in here a struggling economy where small businesses are closing everyday!<//text>

<Text>Fun store to shop. They sell fabric and furry rugs cut to order, as well as a gazillion other home items you didn't realize you need. It's close to Castro Theatre and there is a parking lot on the same street, so it's super easy to get to.<//Text></record>

Mood is a fabulous fabric store; their stock of quality fabrics is incredibly diverse, and it's practically guaranteed that you'll find something in here. However, it is probably the priciest place to get fabric in LA, so I recommend shopping around the fashion district and then coming here last. I made the mistake of shopping at Mood first and I bought a few fabrics here that I later found for cheaper prices on Maple or 9th. One star off for the difficulty of finding help in the store. It's not THAT big of a store (and it was practically empty when I went), but no matter where I turned I couldn't find someone to cut fabric for me or answer questions.</Text>

Great fabric assortment, but pricey! Although other Google reviewers complained about the staff, I found everyone very helpful, polite & professional. They pulled out numerous bolts to find just the right color or material. Again, prices were high but material selection was unique & beautiful.</Review>

<Review>This is for the online retail store front. It was a horrible experience where they held funds and verified the items I ordered were in stock but after 3 weeks they sold out and did not process my order. They also charged and sent me a 2nd order I asked to cancel. Wazoodle Fabrics owner Arch took care of me and won my business with professional customer service. I suggest people check them out before commiting to mood fabrics.. I rather try hobby lobby or joan's before mood fabrics ever again. The online chat customer service is a joke.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b96980a90085:0xa557d7a6f4b94abc< /GmapID></record>

I dislike that the rolls of fabric, at new location, are just too high up to reach and see😕.  Thus making it difficult for customers and especially the employees.
Good News: Thank goodness, employee named "GUSTAVO", he was so patient and helpful.  What an asset to Mood's. Thanks for your assistance, keep up the good work.</review>

I visited this store and it was wonderful. Great selection, really friendly staff. I was able to walk in, get help, and check out in about 20 minutes. The store has so much light and is very well organized. I prefer this one to the one in New York, but both are worth visiting.< /text>

OK so Mood has amazing fabrics, but they have so much it's an information overload.  Even the staff complains there is just too much.  Even worse is buying in-store there is no article numbers - making it harder/near impossible to re-order products.  When ordering online fabric is received with a sticker, detailing what it is.  When buying in-store there is the tag in the end of the bolt, but it does not have numbers, just a price and hopefully the fabric composition.  If the tag is gone, the price is given based on anything they find that is similar.  They cut, put a sticker with the price and yardage.  The end.

In addition, the prices online can differ GREATLY.  I went in to pick up some fabrics today and was advised it's quite common.  I don't know how it is justifiable to have prices nearly DOUBLED in store compared to online though.

Clearly this is a business decision and not really anything staff in-store have control over, but I will be buying as much as I can online  moving forward. It'll be worth going down to look and jumping online to order, even with the shipping fee.

Some of the staff are SUPER friendly and amazingly helpful, others really couldn't care less.  Having a staff member reply to a question with "I'm hung over ask me tomorrow" is not what one would expect when looking for specific merchandise.

Some consistency would be good guys :)< /review>

<text>I love the location, since I can walk to it and have found the staff to be very helpful.  The fabric is more expensive that at other stores.  I pay the difference because I enjoy taking the "free" classes, which aren't free once you factor in the premium pricing.  Don't blame them since they have to offset the costs associated with the sewing classes.</text>< Rate>

Today was my first time going to Mood and I was genuinely disappointed. There is a huge selection of beautiful fabrics but you can find the same fabrics on the fashion district with a little effort. Mood's prices are 2-4 times what you can find the same fabrics/trims for downtown! The only thing I did think might be worth my coming back were the leather hides as they do have a wide variety of colors and finishes and those aren't marked up so ridiculously.</text>

Can't believe the customer service!
We needed additional fabric for my daughters prom dress. Ivan located the fabric with a couple of emails and a picture of the fabric. Then he overnighted it to us!
Outstanding customer service!! Thank you Ivan!<//Text>

The highest-quality fabrics, widest selection and best, most helpful, professional staff in L.A. (to my knowledge). The sewing and fashion design classes are the best value in LA.< /Review>

I take FREE beginner sewing classes here with instructor Linda Tidwell. In just 6 short weeks of one class a week I've learned so much and still can't believe it's all free.  Their fabric and notions selection is amazing but tends to be pretty pricey. The staff is really nice and patient even when the store is unbearably crowded. I'm eager to sign up for more classes and workshops.</Text>

The store has a nice selection but staff was rude and very unhelpful. We were ignored for awhile then sent off in the wrong direction. The old location and staff were much better.
Mood must improve its customer service.< /text>

The store is great, and some of the employees are polite and or helpful; however ther are some rude one/s that have no/very dull fabric knowledge and should not be working at any textile store.</text>

<gmapID>0x80c2b96980a90085:0xa557d7a6f4b94abc<//gmapID><Text>THE LA BREA STORE Itself is OK. There is a lack of sales people to help cut fabric for you, and a bunch of eye rolls and pretense from workers, we could all do without! I don't get why people are NOT genuinely polite, fake it if you have to.. at the least, especially in a work place.

I am writing this review for the NJ STORE through online sales. I had been discussing with the same representative for over 2 weeks, about a special fabric I needed. It took 2 weeks for her to tell me they won't get the fabric in for 3months !. I can understand 2-3 days to get back to me but 2 weeks for a large order over 400$ on a fine fabric. Bottom line, they are simply incompetent at this store... I ended up ordering with the same Rep. a simple Silk Charmeuse lining... I needed it immediately, knowing this the representative should have taken the time to make sure the order was correct.

Well I received the order and I was shocked, it was clearly a joke. Everything I had ordered was silk charmeuse in various color swatches and a full order of silk charmeuse. They sent the swatches to me in silk charmeuse and yet for my full fabric purchase, they sent me polyester silk! it was so hideous I could barely stand to look at it and in the wrong color on top of it. I mean this is like working at a record store and not knowing what a CD is? Silk Charmeuse is standard! it seems almost on purpose, who ever cut this. knew they cut the wrong fabric. What kind of business are they running here at Mood, what kind of people are they hiring?  This is the fashion business! time is money! not amateur hour in preschool to play games and be ignorant of your work materials.

I blame the managers and hiring managers and I would fire ALL of them!. For not training new employees properly and not double checking all orders to make sure the fabric content is correct. Its like they sent me sand paper labeled silk. its just wrong. its a joke. DO NOT ORDER from the online store, over the phone or from the NJ location. Avoid it at all cost. IT has been the absolutely worst experience from beginning to end, you bet I'm in a MOOD to fire them all!.... Such simple requests that occur daily and routine are turned into massive headaches you don't need. Buy your fine fabric elsewhere. :)</Text>< rate>

They make you feel welcome and the massage and shaving the back of your neck the way the old barber shops did is only part of the reason to keep coming back back. Jessica is awesome.</Review>

<rating>3</rating><Review>Clean place, good people and good cuts. I can only give a 3 though due to a couple things.
1. Overpriced, you have a shop 3 doors down doing the same men's cut for $12. But the $12 does not include the 60 second vibration massage.
2.  Appointment application system seriously flawed.
You set an appointment for say an hour away, but then the hour comes and now it's another hour away.  An employee told me that's because the system doesn't take in to consideration breaks or lunches or how long current cuts will take. So all in all the appointment application is worthless, just show up and hope they're not packed with only half the stations filled.
3.  Full house of customers waiting and stylist leave for lunch, not just one at a time either.  In my line of work, if customer's are waiting, then so does my lunch and everything else until the clients are taken care of.
If these thing don't matter to you, great, you will get a good cut from friendly staff.  If they do, I still suggest you check them out for yourself at least once.
I hope honest feedback is appreciated, this is with no intent to bag on anyone.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

However, I think Carmen needs a little more training. I gave her the directions of how I wanted the cut and what length but she just kept taking more and more off. She also used feathering scissors which I think makes hair look wirey and not as sharp. Furthermore, she kept trying to push pomade on me which I said no to 3 times.</text>< rating>

I was trying to get an appointment. They are busy I get it. I’m trying to figure out how and because Dave was too busy and didn’t want to answer my question he HUNG UP ON ME! You are one of the only places open trying to make money and because your full you can treat the customers who are not making you money for that day like that. Super unprofessional. There are places that can not be open right now because of COVID. You’re fortunate enough to be able to open when you can and that’s how you treat people who want to come a support your business<//review>

< Review>
Decent cuts but these people can’t seem to figure out how to keep appointments. First time they had me wait for over five hours and I was patient because “COVID”. Yesterday they said to make an appointment and when I show up they tell me “sorry we're full for the day, you should have been here earlier. Come back tomorrow”. Absolutely zero regard for people’s time. They’re also way overpriced.</Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>I used to like Great American when they first opened. Now, the wait times are horrible and inconvenient even when using their check in system. My check in time literally said and hour and when I was about to head down it changed to two hours later 3 hours from my initial check in scheduled time. On top of that the barbers rush because they are so busy and you don’t get a quality cut and you can’t make an appointment.

I would recommend Dope barbershop across the street way better barbers and they offer appointments.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Great Haircuts.

Fix the check in system. It is broken!!!!  Maybe you should simply post the que on-line so people can see where they are on the list. Getting a text saying your ready and then waiting for an hour or two is very annoying.</review>

I love this place. The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly, but more importantly, they are extremely talented.

I have been told that they don't allow appointments, which is great if you are like me and prefer to go when you have the extra time. The downside is, however, since they don't allow for appointments, the wait can sometimes be quite long.

They remedy this by allowing you to sign in through their website and then you just show up when it's close to your turn.

I go here, I take my son here, and I recommend this place to anybody who asks.<//text>

He kept his attention and styled just as I had asked. The playlist brought me back to my skateboarding days and it was so nice to see everyone interacting with one another.

My husband has gotten his haircut here for a few years now and they always look good! Got my 2 year old sons hair cut here for his first haircut. To say the least my son was not happy about it. I felt so bad not only for the barber, but for everyone in there. The barber (wish I’d gotten his name) was extremely patient, understanding, and kind.  Just more of a reason why they are the place my husband and I recommend them to everyone trying to find a permanent barbershop!< /text>

Took my boys for the first time and they were great I love the fact they aftershave and massage kids just like adults!! Just gives a nice barber shop feel. Plus the haircuts were clean!! The only down side is a 2 hour wait time. But I can see why everyone wants to go there.</Text>

Tried giving this location another shot after having a poor experience last time in which I had a 45 minute wait turn into 3 hours, but only got the same results this time around. Got a text that It was my turn after waiting the hour estimated wait time I was given, showed up only to get skipped by everyone and after another hour of waiting inside, I had to leave once again. If you’re a parent or someone with a full time job, I don’t recommend this barber shop to you, if you have all day long to sit and wait hours for a haircut, be my guest!< /Text>< pictures>

I do however suggest to come here during the middle of the day when it’s not busy. That way you can get your haircut and have an easier time leaving the parking lot.< /text>< pics>

Just got done and i can say this place was a let down..dope barbershop across the street was closed so i gave this place a shot and the guy that cut my hair, i dont remember his name but he was asian, gave me a fade with a comb and the trimmer. Ive never been to a barbershop where i was give a fade using a comb, usually barbers use multiple guards and slowly blend the side and top but nope it looks like i have two sizes and cheap blend. Im really upset cause now i have to go and get it fixed by someone who can actually fade hair professionally.< /text>

< Review>
Quality of the haircut didn't match the price.  $24 is a little steep.  I wouldn't have mind paying that amount but I feel the instruction for my haircut wasn't fully understood.   (Midhigh norelco ( razor fade)  The barber seemed a little apprehensive to get comfortable with my big dome.  One side was slightly higher than the other and some hair didnt get to the skin around the ears and back of my head.  I had to fix my haircut when I got home.

Needless to say,  the shop itself was super clean and the decor is really cool.   However,  I don't think I'll come back.</Review>

Brought my boys to get a fade/haircut , we have never experienced a bad hair cut ever until today. This is a first. The lady who cut my oldest sons hair apparently was thrown into her first day without any training because someone quit yesterday. Burchered my sons hair to the point of no return even after another barber tried to correct it. Not even a offer of comp or any apologies from I believe was the owner or manager. All he said was “at least it will grow back” how is this my fault or my sons that you throw a girl with no proper training to cut peoples hair. I would have at least liked an apology. Never coming here again! Time to find a new place to spend my money on! $60 for 3 haircuts! Never again! This is how you treat my family even  when my husband is deployed fighting for our freedom!<//text>

First i like the vintage feel  that achieved with modern touch. Tool boxes, bikes or chairs. Stylist are good and energizing. If i have to take one star down that is i don't make appointments and don't get same stylist every time and get slightly different cut . Thanks boys and Girls.<//text>

This is more than just a haircut, it is an experience.  The atmosphere like an old style barber shop just brings the "guy" out in me.  The motorcycle in the front window sets that tone when you walk through the door.  The last guy who cut my hair was a blast and let me feel at home immediately.< /Review>

Great barbershop. Put yourself on the waitlist and they text you when you should head in. That’s right no more waiting forever in the shop.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>So I had a 6:30 appointment and my managers meeting ran late at work. I tried calling American Barber for about 15min while I drove 35min to there shop. I arrived at 6:42 to find everyone busy cutting hair. I asked the lady at the counter why the phone was busy and she looked around not knowing why and spoke with a barber and then found the phone off the hook on the counter. I find this completely unprofessional. This is exactly why I don’t staff the businesses I work for with women only. All I found at the Barbershop is everyone being loud talking over each. I then asked how long for a hair cut and she told me to wait 15-20min.

I then told her you found a great way to lose business and walked out the door.

I’ll be contacting the manager tomorrow to let him know how well his employees are keeping business coming through the door.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1538504210783, 'text': "Vincent, we employ very capable and very talented individuals.

< review>
I had been Barberless for a few years after my regular hung up his clippers in retirement. Going to one place after another without really getting that "this is the place" feeling. Stopped by this spot about a month or so ago, and was called to the chair by Melissa. And I haven't been to another place since. Melissa goes above and beyond for her clients, whether you're a regular, or just a passer by. Well she turned me into a regular. My Fiancee said I can only get my hair cut by her from now on. Highly recommend this place, and Melissa.<//review>

<Text>They need to fix there wait time app. What ended up saying a 30 min wait ended up in a 1 hour and 50 min wait. Unacceptable. I would have gone somewhere. Last time I’m coming here!

<Review>Absolute joke, my third trip to a GAB location and now I know why I wait so long every time I join the waiting list. Today I yet again selected 'First Available' in the app and the wait time was 20 minutes. Got there after a 15 minute journey, checked-in and I'm top of the list so wait patiently but people keep going ahead of me. After 45 minutes of people lower than me on the list going in front of me I've had enough and ask why. A lady explained it's because people are selecting their barber by name in the system therefore no one is available. So by that rational I could sit there all day and still not get seen simply because I didn't select a barber by name. Which explains why I once waited 1 hr 50 mins when I thought they were just busy.  Got proper mugged off! Thanks for nothing GAB!<//Review>< Rating>

<date>1556917762604< /date><rate>3</rate><Review>Really thought I found a place I wanted to go get my haircut. I suffered through the customer who was cussing at me the first time I went telling me I am an A-hole and more because I declined having a beer with him and giving him my phone number. By the way he got picked up by the cops after, aka Karma. Then today I go back for the fifth time thinking ok the service here is beyond excellent and after waiting an hour and forty five minutes I get a gal who was subpar. She really asked me if I wanted  the services that normally comes with the cut. I said I don't know do I?  Her response was its just a neck shave and massage. Well what I am paying for I could go to supercuts if I wanted bland. sadly after the fifth time today was the only time I had to go home and change because I have hair down my shirt driving me crazy. Maybe this is not the place for me after all if I can't have consistency.  To be fair there are some stylist there I had seen before who are amazing.  It is partly my fault for playing russian roulette. I say try it but get the person you want. As for me I need to think about if I want to choose to go back with one very very very bad experience where I almost walked out and now a bad stylist who made me feel like I was being processed at the DMV.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I went with my two kids, three disasters walked out of the store.
Sunday, most of the team that I am used to see  are not here.
My sons haircut was done in under 7 minutes. Mine took only 11 minutes. This was like the fastest haircut in my life. I walked out with cuts on my neck from wrong way of handling a razor.
I will never do my haircut with anyone I don't know.< /Review>

<Review>It's a really nice shop and everything but I had the worst experience. I thought I'd give this barbershop a try with my two year old they told us we were next and they kept pulling others ahead of us who had "appointments". Then they called another barber off his break to cut my son's hair and he was in a bad mood and being extremely rude. To top it off he was not being very nice to my son who is scared to get his hair cut and the first thing the barber does is cut my son behind his ear. Truly truly disgusted at how that barber acted. His words were "i don't get why he's acting like that he's had a haircut before hasn't he". Constant rude comments. I wish I had caught his name. I will absolutely never bring my son here again. I've never had such a bad experience.< /Review>< UserId.>

The waits are never long, even for walk-ins.  They did a great job with my 8-year-old's hair (keeping him entertained with banter) and with my own cut.  I will admit that the quality can be spotty ... I've had one bad cut out of 6.  The guy was in a hurry.  Definitely recommend.<//text>

<Review>This place gives a good haircut but lacks severely in the customer service/attention to detail department!
Today would of been my third haircut but after an hour and ten min wait I walked out. The story goes like this. I walk in at 530 sign my name and request Whitney, pick a seat and chill. It was busy so I expected some wait for sure. She gets done with a couple hair cuts and goes to the front sign in sheet, has a conversation with who I assume is the manager or owner then, takes another client. I’m sitting there thinking ok I must be next, sweet! She gets done with that cut and does the normal sweep and clean like everyone else gets her things and is gone with the wind! Mind you I have been sitting there for about 40 min at this point and supprisingly I’m not that upset with it! I get it things come up and you gotta go, fine.
So now I am sitting and waiting, more people other than myself are getting called, I’m getting frustrated and trying to rationalize why I’m not getting called. So I do the socially polite thing and get up stretch, walk over to the sign in sheet and take a look. On my way back to my seat one of what barbers asked if I had any questions I replied “just stretching, I’ve been here awhile” “ok cool just checking”! Perfect my polite social ques worked! NOPE! Next barber gets up calls another person! I get up and on my way out the door a different barber ask me what my name was it told him my name and informed him I had been waiting there an hour and ten minutes and had no interest in waiting another second! One would think that after seeing a guy waiting for that long someone would inquire before calling another person much less informing the said person that the person they requested would not be able to do there cut!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I took my boys in to get there school haircuts and I have to say I was disappointed at the end.

I first walked in and the girl at the first chair asked if I called in so automatically I assumed it was by appointment only.(Not a hi or welcome) Till the gentleman came over & said it was okay & to just sign my boys in.

The wait wasn't to long for my first son but as I walked him over to the gentleman's chair he gave me the impression that he wasn't in the mood to cut my sons hair & he didn't even make my 3 year old comfortable enough to want to be in his chair.

It want till I started a conversation till he loosened up a bit.

My sons end results wasn't as bad as others posted but he could have used a lot more blending you could see his lines on the sides still and he could have blended up more. Lines are something your not suppose to see.

My second sons haircuts was okay till I seen his line up in the back. It's wasn't straight at all and he brought it up a lil to high.

I had to have my husband fix it right away his is the second picture of it fixed on yelp</text>< gmap_id>

What happened to this once awesome place.  I've been to the original location on Somerville and I just had my second haircut at the Herndon location. My first two haircuts I love very much and I found that the people there were extremely knowledgeable with style and we're able to cut the hair extremely well. However I got my haircut there yesterday and it is easily the WORST HAIRCUT i have ever had. I found that the woman who cut my hair Not only was not aware of mens style but she actually wasn't able to properly and accurately cut my hair whatsoever. She had missed a number of spots where she was giving me the number 2 around my sides, so I have multiple uncut places around my head. She went way too high up on the undercut on the back of my head, didn't properly cut the top portion of my hair either and during the whole process she waited till the very end to pin up my hair (i had semi long hair) so as she was giving me the number 2 around my sides, she clipped my ear many times. She did say she was new to the place but she'd been cutting hair for many years. I felt almost as if they hired her from a Super Cuts establishment. And more importantly what I noticed about the whole ambience of the barbershop is that it felt very different from the first two times I went there. The first two times it felt like this very stylish men's barber shop with extremely knowledgeable barbers that new mens style very well. This time around I felt like the entire place had kind of reverted back to your everyday cookie cutter Barber Shop. Many new faces and maybe everybody else there would have performed a better haircut than the person I had but the entire Place felt different. The uniqueness that they had seem to have disappeared. Its like they went from a quality 1 location to saying screw the quality to quantity. Having photos of hipsters and motorcycles and a cool color scheme doesn't matter if they can cut hair right!!!  However I did call their original location and express to them my displeasure with my haircut and they did say they'd be willing to get me in and try to salvage it for me for free. So they do seem to be very accommodating still and I hope the original location has more of the feel, knowledge and expertise that I noticed the first two times I've been to the Great American barber shop. I will not ever go back to the Herndon location and depending on what happens at the original location when they try to fix it, it may be he whole establishment all together.</text>

Horrid they dont give the haircut i asked for i said do not touch the top of my hair but they say they will thin it, no they cut it shorter to make it look more "clean", this is unacceptable because the customer should decide for themself this will take me 2 months to regrow thank you i would perfer to go back to great clip because if you ask them they will give the correct haircut DO NOT GO... IM MAKEING SURE I INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I hope people understand this annoying problem, also ill get this place known for bad haircuts, you played with fire great american barber shop, and im making sure buisness goes downhill for ypu guys from now on. Thanks burn in hell<//review>

<Review>The customer service from the person at the desk was great. But the wait times are bad. When i got home i noticed they did not change all the valve stems and my rim was scratched all the way around by the mounting machine. Worst part is they cant even tell me about it when im sure the installer who did it knew. I dont trust this place with my vehicle any longer so anybody else beware.</Review>< userid>

We took my car in for a catalytic converter replacement.  They told us it had to be special order from a vendor. So we agreed.  We called few days later to check on it and seems like the lady forgot to place the order.  So we patiently waited again. My car was at the shop for 9 days just so we get told that the order was canceled for whatever reason 😒.  And she tried to push us to get it from a dealer which was more expensive.   No consideration at all. Big Fiasco, seems like people there don't care, we waited like 10 minutes cus they lost our car key when we picked up our car. We are definitely taking our business somewhere else. Ridiculous!!< /Text>< Pics>

Good work, overcharge on price. They work on my rotor and change brake pad. The problem solve they said. After taking for a test drive they found another problem. They tell me that the front bearing need to be replace. To my knowledge, they should have known the problem when they change my rotor and brake pad. But what really upset me the price to replaced the wheel bearing, they said it will cost me 700 plus tax to replace one wheel bearing. To me, that’s overcharging customer. Please be honest with your price and be fair. Don’t take advantage of people who’s traveling away from home.<//review>

<Text>Absolute worst service i have ever received. This is a small town so I will not name names but the associates that helped me were horrible and did not care or have any pride in their customer service. My car was there for 9 days because they "special ordered" a catalytic converter for my vehicle.  Everytime I called besides the phone ringing for 3 - 4 minutes once answered i would then be placed on hold for several more minutes only to find out they know nothing because they do not communicate with each other. On the 9th day I called to ask what progress has been made and it took about 10 minutes to find out that none has been made. They called me back 2 hours later to let me know that Apparently the catalytic converter they requested was never shipped because it was not california compliant. I then went to pick up my vehicle and the guy at the counter could not find my paper work or car key. Took about 10 minutes for him and some of the mechanics to locate them. I took my vehicle up the street to a local shop and I will now do all of my business with them. I have 4 vehicles and my wife and I commute so maintenance is always needed. Never again will i set foot in this place and I strongly discourage anyone else to waste their time or money with them.</Text>< pics>

I have to say Firestone is always excellent with their customer service and that is why I keep going there! I also have a Firestone card for emergencies as they are located everywhere....Today we stopped at this location for air, one of our tires seemed low. As usual they assisted us right away in this 100 degree heat!!! I buy all my tires and my daughters as well at Firestone and we get our cars serviced by them and my consumer confidence is always high with Firestone, thanks guys!<//Text>

<text>Started with making an appointment. But my truck has not moved for first 40 minutes. does this establishment understand how to schedule work, well apparently not. Have a slow leak in a tire, purchased tires at Firestone, should have purchased tires some were else. Bad service in Vacaville store is running rampant.< /text>< time>

<Name>Jake Sawicki</Name><text>I came here after having a negative experience at the Fairfield location.  I had made an appointment at 5PM at the Fairfield location, only to be told upon arrival that they wouldn't have time to mount the tires because they closed in an hour.  Isn't that the whole purpose behind booking an appointment?  However, it was quite the opposite experience at this vacaville location.  I showed up towards the end of the day, with no appointment, and these guys stayed more than an hour after the shop closed to finish my tires and other customers vehicles.  I was not expecting this level of service after my experience in fairfield.< /text>< user>

I don’t know how they get away with advertising  they’re  a full service repair shop. Yeah. Sure.
They get one star because they have the skill to answer the phone and print from the computer.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Took car in for tire rotation and oil change. I had no appointment. told them that I will be supplying my own oil filter from the dealer for that make and model of vehicle. Was told they could not use my oil filter. That because they are doing the oil changed they would have to use theirs on my vehicle. I've had issues with aftermarket oil filters and a blown motor due to a faulty oil filter and ended up getting stuck for the replacement of the engine. Was not going to get into details with them but they have lost a customer.I have gone to other places to have my oil changed and have supplied the oil filters with no problem from them at all. I've had other shops through this company not having an issue with using my filter in only knocking off a couple of dollars for the cost of the filter. But Firestone has lost a customer a long-time customer. Nice going.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

So my wife takes my car in for an oil change and we have an 11am appointment. They tell her it's going to take an hour and 15 minutes. No big deal. She then tells the employee that the low tire light just turned on and if they can check it for her. The employees comment was "I can't believe you are driving around with a baby in the car when the tire is about to pop." Because the employee can tell that it is going to pop from the counter inside the building. On top of all that he said they will not put air in the tire. This employee should be promoted asap, it's really sad that this has happened to my wife, I guess after this oil change we will take our business elsewhere.</Text>

<text>They do a good job on alignments, tires and oil changes. Sometimes they recommend  other services they'd like to do, but research first and hesitate before going ahead. Glad they're under new management, did not care for some of the previous service engineers.< /text>< username>

< Review>
Brought my car in For Brakes, Oil change and what I was told was a bad axle(From a prior visit).

Left with Brake noise, Oil leaks and turns out the Axle wasnt the cause to my Mystery noise which was still present.

Came back only to have them replace a wheel bearing now on a completely different Wheel than the axle. They also "Adjusted" my brakes.

Came back again with brake noise and the mystery noise which hasn't gone away. Oh and now My car smokes... Yep. Smokes. Like Big time... Had to stop driving the car.

Brought it back in One last time to give them a chance to make it all right only to have another Botched oil change (Didnt tighten the oil filter aparently) and them tell me the "Mystery noise" Is my rear diff and to take it to a Transmission shop. They offered no reimbursement for the 1200$ I spent getting the brakes and axle fixed. Both of which are still problematic.

The New manager even told me the tech who they originally put on my car didnt know what he was doing or talking about. Pretty unprofessional to say the least.

Now I cant even get them to answer my calls. Going to call corporate Next.   I would stay away from this shop at all costs.</Review>

<Text>I came in an hour before they closed for a battery service and they turned me away (fair enough). BUT I had apologized to the guy working the front that i came so late and told him my car had died outside in the parking lot. Did he offer to jump it or see if anyone could? Nope lol, so it’s currently 90degrees and I’m stuck outside waiting an hour for my partner to come off. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced, will 100% never come here because of that. Who does that?</Text>< Pictures>

The last time I used Firestone was almost 20 years ago in Fairfield. Back then it was a 4 wheel alignment they just couldn't get right after 6 tries. Took my vehicle to a random tire shop in Vacaville, fixed on first try. Never went back since. Back to the present, I figured a lot can change in that time, different store, had an appointment etc. My appointment was at 10am for 4 tires pre-ordered and in stock... waiting in lonby...Didn't leave the store till after 2. That's an hour a tire. There staff was friendly as they apologize for the wait 🤨. Parking lot was extremely small with cars with completed work parked in fire lanes. Second chance given but failed.< /review>

< Review>
I had a flat tire and my spare tire had a defective valve, so I had to have it towed to Firestone. First i thought I'd have to wait a long time for buying & for installation  Instead the head clerk assessed my dilemma and said she'd have one of the servicemen repair the valve on the spare and have it put on my car. On top of that about 30 minutes later I wasn't even charged for it. What a blessing! I live in Woodland where I prefer to purchase my tires and was relieved that she was understanding of my situation having had to be towed and all.< /Review>

<review>Good service at fair prices.

We only take our vehicles here because we can trust  they will get the job done right. Once, a few years back there was an issue with our brakes and they tried to repair but the problem got worse. They replaced the rotors free of charge and fixed the problem for good. I wouldn't go anywhere else.</review>< pictures>

If I could give a 0 I would!   Let me start by saying,  I have been going to Vacaville Firestone for several years. Brian the former Manager was honest and fantastic.  Brian and German were always available to give honest advice and repair my cars in a timely manner.  Once they left Firestone things changed, and not for the better.
A couple months ago, I went in had my sons cars oil changed. The check engine light was on , I approved them to put it on the reader and found 150$ later it was an 02 sensor (30$) at the parts store they wanted 300$ to change OMG!    I said thank you no I would do myself.

Today I walked outside to a flat tire. AAA put my spare on and I figured I would give Firestone one more chance.  The Tech Looked at my tire. The nail was about an inch in from the wall of the tire. He told me if the nail was leaking he would not be able to repair the tire. That I would need to purchase a new tire. He came in a little while later, told me the tire was not repairable and I needed a new tire.  He looked through his computer advising, they had no tires in stock but could have the 200$ tire later this afternoon.  I said no thank you.  I called les schwab.  Who had my tire size. The tech took my tire. Came in about an hour later. He told me, he had great and good news.  He said he removed 2 nails and a screw from the tire and was able to repair the tire.  He contradicted Firestone by advising, as long as the nail wasn’t in the sidewalk the tire was repairable and that the tire was repaired for free!!!!!!
I gave the tech a nice tip for his time and his honesty.   Firestone has lost a faithful customer for their dishonesty.    I wish I knew where Brian and German had left to. I would definitely give them my business.  Now les Scwab will be my go to place.<//Text>

< Review>
Decent service. They were unable to pull two of the four service light codes from my car but still charged me the full $99 to check them (I found out after the fact that Autozone does this for free). I went there three months in a row and the first months they said my tires were fine, the next month they said that they highly recommended that I get all four tires replaced, and the third month the tires were magically fine again and I didn't get them changed. Funny thing was they were having a sale on tires that second month, so watch out if they are suggesting things just because they are on sale. Other than that, the service was pretty good.</Review>

Beware, this store is racialist! If you are a minority and visit this store,  you should be very careful about your saying , any argument or complaint will cause refusal of service by that white manager, especially if he think your business is not very profitable. I signed service agreement for repairing a flat tire by a store staff but that white manger then refused to serve me because I merely said" it is a minor repair and should be finished within 10 minutes" when I was informed they need an hour. My tires are Firestone and only purchased 2 month ago for 800 dollars with warranty,  and I also agreed to pay them 20 dollars for repairing. I will never forgot that white guy's face, a expression with full of discrimination.<//Review>

Our experience was not pleasant. The manager apeared to be rude or very stressed even with his own personnel.  He may not know it or may not help it. But we urge the owner or the board of directors to do something about it. The deal l got was fantastic for an oil change. Graet coupon. But still l think l would not come back even if l could get a good deal again.  Good deals and knowladgable technicians is a good thing u got going.But great customer service is the key to success.<//text>

SADLY NEW MANAGEMENT HORRIBLY RAN!!!!went In for an oil change nd shockingly my car wasnt put back together correctly. Causing extreme damage to my new car had to call and complain to 800# 5 times n 24hr. After 1st call I received a call 6 hrs later from the person I complained about telling me my complaint about him wasnt valid nd that I couldn't come back lol because I filed a complaint on him and he called to I guess tell me hes the 1 who deals with his own complaints almost 3 days later no call nothing from the regional manager. Firestone u should b ashamed nd trell or whatever his name is is sadly gonna take vacaville Firestone down with his harrassment of customers who complain about him. AFTER READING REVIEWS ON YELP GUESS TRELL THE MANAGER IS JUST TELLING EVERYONE HE DOESNT WANT THEIR BUSINESS LOL THIS PLACE IS THE WORST I SEEN IT IN 8YRS OF GOING HERE .... I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS WHY IT WAS AS EMPTY AS IT WAS EVEN THEN IT TOOK 1 1/2 & two calls to corporate about trells attitude</Text>

< review>
Last week I set an appointment time for my RV. Called before I came in to confirm appointment time. Was informed all good come in, showed up at 10:00 am set time. Waited until 12:00 before RV moved, 45 mins later they call me "I'm in waiting are" tell me tires didn't come in on Thursday shipment.  Both tires off one unmounted. Really!!! WOW talk about dropping the ball, will be looking around, may not come back ever...hummmm<//review>

I purchased a set of performance tires from them for my BMW a few months ago, the rear tire was loosing air rapidly so I took it in for repairs, they told me that they didn't have time and to come back the next day, they filled it with air and sent me on my way. They next day I brought it back and was told it couldn't be repaired because the tire had a nail on it and they would have to order the tire for me and to come back again the third day. So they once again filled it with air and sent me on my way. First of all, they had plenty of time to look over the tire, it was 3:30 pm and they don't close until 7:00 pm! At least to insure their customers safty! Secondly, they should have been able to determine if a new tire needed to be ordered on the first visit, at the very least have it available the next day just in case. If it ended up not being needed no harm done since it was a store transfer. Instead their lazy employees would rather inconvenience their customers and potentially put them in harms way. I'll never purchase another item from Firestone.<//text>

<Review>Service was sub par. The guy who helped me in the evening was very impolite and they didn't align my wheels correctly. I bought the lifetime alignment package, so I'll be taking it into a Sacramento location to get it done right.< /Review>< user>

I've been growing my hair out since quarantine started. I saw Loryn and she straightened me out! Very friendly and professional. The cut looks great and I'm be back in a few months. Parking was a little tricky but ended up on the side of ocean Ave. The shop is on the second floor of the luxury apt building.<//text>

Jasmine is amazing at color and has helped me go from pink, green, platinum blonde, and now bright yellow with no excessive damage. She knows exactly how I like my hair cut and styled and always recommends products for me to use to keep my hair soft and healthy. And this neighborhood is so cute and has great juice and coffee shops nearby so you can have a good iced latte while you get your hair done!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7DIGYC34kKE2vbAq1W2qCc1pCC0eNO_61lhIt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I love it here. I get my hair done by Brittany Castillo and she always knows exactly what I want. She gives the most amazing head massages when shampoos me!< /Text>

I want to give them 5 stars but I was very concerned when I walked in for my cut with Loryn and the Owner, did not have a mask on!

As an owner, he should be more considerate of the welfare of his customers and wear a mask and use apprpriate distancing when greeting his customers.  My hairdresser, Loryn did have a mask on and wore it all the while she was cutting my hair, she even asked me what I preferred for safety measures while cutting my hair.
This pandemic is serious and fatal, especially to people who may be at a high risk.  I hope the owner will take  the example of the hairdressers in his salon and start taking this virus seriously.
Thank you Loryn for being responsible and caring!!</review>

Have been coming to this salon/barbershop for years. All the stylists are amazing, and this is definitely the place to go for modern styles. And I'm always given free drinks while I wait.</Review>

Basically don't go any where else. Guys cuts, girls cuts. Cut color style and beards they've done everything for my family. Clean and professional shop reflects their work. They crush it!< /Text>

<text>Had an unexpected transmission issue.  The entire transmission had to be replaced.  Not only did Josh and his team deliver, but they delivered sooner than promised - almost a week and a half sooner.  Anyone with an RV knows that repairs can take time.  Josh , Victor, and the team were professional, courteous, and very up front with costs.  I did my homework and shopped around.  This is my second time in (first time was for service) and I continue to be impressed with their knowledge and recommendations.  They will treat you like family and your vehicle like their own.  Also, they let me have my vehicle towed right to their lot.  My own RV dealer couldn't make that happen.  Thanks again Auto & RV Specialists!</text>< Time>

< Review>
Found this place as a referral from a friend and can't say enough good things about Josh and his team. I had them do some warranty work on our 2020 Momentum and was extremely pleased with the work they did. That says a ton because I'm picky as hell. Since then I have had them install solar panels on the roof and couldn't be happier with how clean it looks. If you need your RV repaired this is the place to go!<//Review>

They worked on my 1965 mustang fixing the transmission it had a leak from the dipstick tube along with the 2 band adjustment seals. And re adjustment of the bands. Picked car up with no leaks at all with better shifting of the car. I recommend anyone that values there cars like I do to take it to the Auto and RV Specialist in Rancho Cucamonga. Great service with great prices with a on time pick up of your vehicles. Thanks Bill Duke 🏁</Review>

I took my trailer in to have a few adjustments made and get propane tanks filled. Josh and Tammy were so friendly and so helpful. Josh spent extra time with me answering my questions and the entire experience was so positive and easy. I will definitely go back to this place when I need anything done to my trailer.< /review>

If you own an rv, you know how challenging it can be to find excellent rv mechanics as well as getting a timely appointment. Well, look no more. They really know their stuff here and do their best to get you in and out. The dealer where I bought my rv couldn't schedule us for 3 months for a critical issue with our fridge. We would have had to cancel a long-planned trip. Here they were able to squeeze us in. It took a couple of weeks to get it all done, but our trip was saved! Super nice people in front office and in the garage. I highly recommend this business!</Text>

Josh was a  complete delight to work with as he kept in touch with us throughout the service and communicated any outstanding issues we should address.  The technician spent a great deal of time of the generator, air conditioning units (in dash and top mounted), converter and inverter to ensure proper diagnosis and servicing.

At first the estimate for a trans service was under $300. I told Vic yes. Then he calls me back that they didn’t add labor and would actually be $420!?!?!?  WTH?!?!?   300 for parts?!???!  Never mind,  took it to Brian’s for $350< /Text>

<Text>Upgraded suspension on my 27 ft. Travel Trailer, repacked wheel bearings, cleaned & adjusted electric brakes.
Josh ordered all the “specialized parts” for the upgrade and the installation was done right the first time.

All the work was done faster than I planned (a good thing 😀) and the price was fare.

Josh took a personal interest in my upgrades & maintenance and explained everything to be done, unlike bigger shops where you are just a number.

A very positive experience. I will come back for all my maintenance, repairs and future upgrades.

I recommend Auto & RV Specialists for any work you may need on an RV.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<Review>I've been a full-time RV'er for almost 3 year's now and after visiting several other RV center's during that time Auto And Rv Specialist is my new #1 go to guys and it's my privilege to burn a little extra gas to drive past their competitors on my way to them.

I have a low mileage 92 Jambo which isn't the 2019 diesel pusher most places are looking to milk money out of or so is the vibe I've gotten in the past and from my first visit here I felt treated like a local showing up for a BBQ, these are real people who you can tell enjoy their job's and helping others and where I feel my business no matter how much I'm spending at the time is just as appreciated as anyone else's.

And their much more economical for me, $30 less on my smog check than anyone else quoted me and they had me out in just under an hour with an appointment, their dump fee is at a minimum half or even less than I've paid anywhere else and it's available 24/7 (call them for details), chemicals here are either cheaper or the same price than I've paid  elsewhere and the propane price is very regionally competitive and discounted on Wednesday.

And as you can read below in other reviews and most intelligent RV'ers and car driver's already know NO ONE could afford to give away free diagnostics and stay in business, not even our doctor's, but for any advice on accessories or other similar guidance these guy's are spot on and have very patiently given me the professional advice for my particular coaches needs.

Thank you everyone at Auto and RV Specialist, during what's become a more difficult time for myself and many other Americans you've stepped up for me as a small business, obviously take extra care to keep me and my RV safe and I always leave your driveway happy happy happy.

I just can't wait to try the restaurant after it safely be reopened, I can tell by pics it's almost everyone's kinda place. 🍺< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1596404581119, 'text': 'Man, we are so thankful for customers like you.

Very helpful.
Little pricey but the service is 5star.
Got propane

Was able to pull in with the Corolla on my tow dolly behind my 30' coach. Get propane and they quickly torqued my lugs to make sure they were good.

If I was in town I would have left it for a tune up.</review>

I was going to take my car to a mechanic that was referred by a friend to me because I'm not from the area. Upon speaking with Triple A, they said they would refer me to a local mechanic and on top of that get a 25% discount for using them so I trusted them and opted to go with their recommendation. Later I found out that not only  was I being a charged for the work that was done, but they charged me a $100.00 fee just for telling me what my problem was. WHAT? I've never been to a mechanic that charges a separate fee just to tell me what is wrong with my car. I wouldn't recommend Auto &  RV Specialists to anyone unless they have rely deep pockets and money doesn't matter. I wouldn't give it any stars but I had no choice in order to complete this recommendation.<//text>

We did “test” your vehicle the first time and the result decided by the State of California was “not ready.” We are bound by B.A.R. Law the says we can not question you before a smog test. We must run the car as it comes in. We agreed to follow all the rules and regulations when we signed up to become a star certified smog center. If we break those rules we could lose our license and no longer be able to provide this service to our customers.  The “Free retest” was a promotion started by another business and is not a state smog thing.  Our technicians deserve to get paid for the work they do and that is why we charge for each test. It is not fair to ask our techs to work for free. We provided you with copies of both tests and if you need additional copies we can provide those. I thank you for your continued loyalty and was the reason I gave you a discount on your 2nd smog test. Again I apologize for any inconvenience.'}< /response><Review>Went In for a smog check with a car I don’t use very often and had to jump  start it prior to going. Mechanic came back 5 minutes later and told me the car couldn’t be tested because the car had to be driven at least 50 miles before the computer on the car would reset and be able to be tested. I said okay I’ll go drive it. He then told me but first you have to pay for the test? They charged me $39 dollars for that tidbit of information!? I drove the car for the 50 miles and came back thinking I would not be charged again! Wrong! I was double charged! After explaining my financial situation being handicapped and on a fixed income Josh gave me a $15 dollar discount. I’m a repeat customer with a few cars being serviced here! Wow! I have given 5 star reviews in the past but not this time! I feel I was taken advantage of instead of being treated like a valued repeat customer a simple go drive it 50 miles and come back would have been the right thing to do. My car did pass the smog test after the fact, but I’m not sure I’ll be back. Really disappointed that my customer loyalty wasn’t appreciated! I should have read the Yelp reviews. I have another car that will be needing a smog test soon and this was my go to place. ☹️</Review>< username>

Josh is the kind of mechanic that once you've found him, you don't give him up.  Honest, knowledgeable, frank, polite/courteous, and friendly are a few of the descriptions that I can muster.  Cars/trucks are the passion of his life, and it shows.  I used to drive from Covina, CA up to the Pinon Hills to have him work on my Ford van.  Now he's a little closer in Rancho Cucamonga...all the better.  I can HIGHLY recommend him.  He's a fine human being and a stellar mechanic.<//text>

< review>
I recently had some suspension work done on my 5th Wheel trailer.  The crew at Auto & RV Specialists took my trailer in the morning and were done by the afternoon. The same day service was fantastic.  Giant RV takes a minimum of 5 weeks. They are priced fairly and they are very friendly.  Hopefully I won't need work done anytime soon but, if I do they are my first choice.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I had a wonderful experience with this shop.  I was traveling to Palm Springs when my car almost lost a rear wheel. My car was towed to a AAA yard that evening and then AAA recommended Auto and RV Specialists to fix my car the following morning.  Moses was so helpful and communicative. He received my car without me being there as I had to rent a car and drive to Palm Springs the evening before.  He assessed the damage and called me to inform me that they could get it fixed before their closing time.  He also made arrangements with me to leave my car in their lot until late that evening when I could come and pick it up. They were fair, courteous and prompt.  It was a great experience in the face of what could have been a disaster!  I recommend them highly!

Love this place. I had about 5 issues with my RV ranging from minor (awning was twisted) to major (living slide out wasn't working).

I dropped it off in their key drop off on a Sunday. They had the keys back in my hand with all of my issues resolved by Friday. It's like my RV is factory new.

They also kept me fully updated on their progress throughout the week.

Last time I had my RV in a "big box dealer" service center to fix one minor stair issue they had my RV for a month without completing the repair... These guys fixed that and multiple other issues, at a very reasonable price, in 4 days.< /text>

Over 10 years ago I needed car repair and went through the yellow pages and picked Auto and RV specialists because they were ecommended by the Auto Club.  I have never regretted the choice.  I was really in a panic because I don't know about car repair shops or mechanics.  I have been coming to them for over 10 years at least 2-3 times a year.  They are extremely competent, always polite and accommodating and reliably honest.  I will continue to patronize them as long as possible.  I would highly recommend their work, efficiency and care.<//text>

I went here for a strange noise from my car. Was taken here by AAA so I trusted them at first. Charged me $60 just to look at it and then the next day they wanted to charge me over $200 to take my intake manifold off. Thought it was fishy so I went somewhere else and it turns out it was the starter and was a $300 fix. This place wanted to charge me " best case scenario" $550 to fix a problem that didn't exist. Don't come here for car repair.<//Review>

Arranged a pre-buy inspection for an RV I was looking at. Although I'm 1200 miles away, I was treated respectfully and got great service! They were very informative with the items they found, and I paid a very reasonable price for the work they did. I'd use them again in a heartbeat!</Text>

Our car stared having major issues all at once to the point where we found it unsafe to drive. Upon arriving at the desk we start telling the large man about all the issues, the phone rings and he quickly cuts us off to answer it. It sounded like a customer was curious about their cars repair progress, this large man quickly snapped off on them telling them its a large job and it'll be done when its done and quickly hung up(he might as well told them to f off). He then allowed us to continue speaking.... He told us that he will set an appointment for a few days and to come back. We asked if we could leave the car on their spacious lot, he told us no because they didn't have the space, he wasn't willing to compromise after implying our car wasn't safe to drive.  We aren't even going to bother bringing it back, I'm sorry but this is a customer service based economy, I hope the people on the phone that day write a review too.</Review>

<Text>NO EMAIL ADDRESS!!!! NO CONTACT FORM ON WEBSITE!!!

VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

These guys did a AAA used car inspection for me, after paying and having the inspection done, they promised to send me the results by email before I drove for 6 hrs to buy the car the next morning. The email never came, I never got a call, and now I am buying a car I know very little about, with a 90.00 inspection I paid for and never recieved.</Text><username>Rich Donald</username></record>

Great business. Very professional. Always informative and honest. I was getting ready for a camping trip and my friends motorhome had some issues just as we were leaving. We took it right over to RV and Auto and they fixed the problems right on the spot. We were all on our way in about an hour. Never have I been to a business where they go out of their way to resolve an issue so fast and make sure you can get back on the road like these guys.

These guys definitely know their stuff. If you need someone to diagnose an issues with a car or rv, check these guys out.<//text>

In one word,  DISHONEST! They charge you for work they don't do and do work you never needed.  Their own employee admitted this when i questioned him. They should not be AAA approved.  Take your vehicle elsewhere.< /Text>

I have been a customer of RV Specialists for several years now, from minor work on my RV to major work (new engine) I've always been happy with their work. A few years ago, my Catalytic Converter went out on my RV while we were on the road heading east. We stopped at a RV repair shop in Kingman AZ and got a diagnosis. The new part was going to take three days to get to Kingman, I really didn't feel comfortable with the shop so I called my guys at RV Specialist and explained my symptoms, turns out that the part the folks in Kingman was ordering was the wrong part. I limped back to Rancho Cucamonga and had the correct part installed in two days. I saved a ton of money and a bunch of time.  I recently had an engine overhaul done on the same RV and trusted the job to RV Specialists, Rob worked closely with my insurance company ensuring that I received the best parts for the repair. Needless to say I was very happy with their service and the end product.  Anyone who owns a RV knows that repairs can be costly, what I appreciate the most about RV Specialists is their honesty, I know that the work being done is exactly what I need. On several occasions they have steered me away from unnecessary repairs by either telling me that I didn't need the work done or that it could be delayed. It's hard to find a really good RV repair shop, and although they can be a bit pricey, it is well worth it knowing that you are getting a thorough job done, and at the end of the day, when you are travelling across the country with your family, peace of mind is priceless.</Review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>This is not really located at Santa Monica Pier, but rather at a food court in a mall about a block away.

We tried the Teriyaki beef and chicken with vegetables. Both had good portions - you won’t walk away hungry. As far as taste goes, we’ve been to other Japanese grills and this one ranks lower. While the sauce looks good, it tastes watered down. The rice was slightly undercooked/harder - half of us liked it this way over softer/soggier.

There is no organization of orders - styrofoam containers are placed side by side with no tickets beside them. It was busy and we had to guess who’s order was next - the person behind us asked if his order was in front of ours which seemed odd, but it actually was. Our order took about 15 minutes - something to expect since they cook the food in front of you.

In any case, I would eat here again because the price was right and it seems like a healthier alternative to burgers and fries, even if the speed of service or food taste isn’t spectacular.<//Review>< pics>

I frequent this excellent place every couple of days because I like the good mood that is part of this place. The team is awfuly loyal and qualified. The service is remarkablywonderfully quick. Not to mention, the food you eat is first-rate. I came more than once and I was always joyful. The pay is decent. I highly suggest this restaurant to my friends and family.</review>

Absolutely delicious and affordable meals. I’m in love with shrimp bento box. For $10.99 you also will have 4 California rolls and vegetable salad. Totally like it!</Text>

<Review>If you want a pile of feces in top of rice this is the place to go.  I came here early lunch today at 10:40 a.m. and nothing was ready.  They served me chicken that was sitting on the corner of the grill for awhile and the food temperature was luke warm, the servers luke at you like they are judging you.  And the cost for that pile of feces with an overly seeet soda, $11.00 not woth the price.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4d1e8877c35:0xac2e27a4939d431</Gmap_id></record>

One of the cheapest lunches in the area. Decent teriyaki chicken bowl. The servers here always look angry and like to slop your food on to your tray.</Review>

I watched this place mess up multiple orders including mine.  The sushi quality was marginal.  There are plenty of better sushi places close by, so don't bother with this one.</Review>

<date>1549572720510<//date><text>(Translated by Google) It looks great on the look. To taste the complete opposite 🙈 Rice soap, without sole, without the taste of vegetables the same, it is all dry. The worst Asian food I've ever had in the US.
I do not recommend

(Translated by Google) It says "JAPAN," but it's more Chinese.
Fried dumplings are very delicious.
California rolls are roughly made, but are they authentic? (Laughs) It's pretty delicious.
It's a food court, but not as fast as in Japan.
Be prepared to wait, even if you are free.

(Original)
JAPANと書いてあるけどどっちかというと中華多め。
揚げ餃子がとても美味しい。
カリフォルニアロールも作りは大雑把だけど本場？(笑)なだけありなかなか美味しい。
フードコートだが日本の様にスピーディーではない。

(Translated by Google) They searched California for a long time for delicious food. And here we liked it. Chicken & Shrimp - it was delicious! The service is friendly. I don’t understand where so much negativity in the comments comes from.

It ’s the worst taste, not Japanese. The one who buys and regrets.

< review>
Marissa at August barbershop has been cutting my hair for about 3 years now and she always does a fantastic job.
The shop is clean, has a really cool old school vibe, and all of the barbers are friendly and professional.
They take Covid precautions seriously which I appreciated.
It isn't the cheapest place to get a haircut, but you definitely get what you pay for: a high quality haircut by professionals who know what they are doing. Try them out once and you'll never want to go anywhere else.< /review>

< review>
The young lady that cut my hair last weekend, did an amazing job. I was making somewhat specific yet vague requests about how I wanted my hair to look and somehow she not only cut it exactly how I wanted it, but it looked better than I could have imagined. Honestly I think this was the best haircut I've ever had. Shout out to that young lady, I wish I remembered her name, she has the second chair though on the left when you walk in. Looking around at the other barbers cutting while there, they all looked like they really knew what they were doing. Would highly recommend this place both for quality and price.</review>

Great place to work or do homework before the haircut. Get your coffee while you wait for the haircut or have the coffee done by when you are finished getting your haircut. Shop is very welcoming with great music and space to start your day. I highly recommend it to anyone< /text>

Ruby, the co-owner here, has been my barber for almost a decade. They give a great and thoughtful cut, will make sure it's to your liking before you go, and have been very diligent about their Covid protocols. Friendly, professional, and a great cut. Not the cheapest cut in town but then again you don't want to look like Mom took a FloBee to your head, do you? You're gonna look and feel great after. A+< /Text>

I originally picked August because it was close to my work. Even though I'm working from home now, I still take the 30 min drive to continue going. Love the vibe of the shop and Ruby's skill with the clippers is phenomenal.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>After moving to the Bay Area, I struggled to find a reasonably priced, but knowledgable barbershop. Around the Stanford area, I found that many did not cut my hair right - blending was super choppy, hair was cut way shorter than I asked, style was completely off, or it took more than an hour to cut. To top it off, some places were charging 50$ for a men's hair cut, which coming from the midwest, seems like a crime.

I recently got my haircut by Marissa. She was extremely kind, super detailed, and communicated with me to make sure I was getting the right cut. I am incredibly happy with the result and feel more confident now that I have my go-to place to get my hair cut. Plus, at $35 I thought the service was fantastic.

Also, they have an adorable puppy named Moose. Make sure to give him chin scratches on your way out!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Came in with overgrown, unruly hair after not having had a haircut for over 4 months. I showed Marissa a picture of my last haircut and she took just one look and knew exactly what to do.

The shop was kept very clean, and both of us had our masks on the whole time. Would highly recommend to anyone in need of a lockdown cut.<//review>

I have a long, coarse, and curly beard. Marissa did an excellent job cleaning it up after about 5 months of growth since my last beard trim. If you have a curly beard and are in the market for a new barbershop I highly recommend Marissa for a trim that will grow out well!<//Text>

<Review>I walk in every 6 months to 10 months with a vague description or complete indifference of what I want done with my shaggy hair and out of control beard. Marissa cuts and buzzes away for 20 minutes and I walk out looking like I belong in a fashion catalog out of Portland instead of looking like a homeless person.
Marissa is also very friendly, but like being in an Uber, I'm not one for small talk and she seems happy to quietly make me look good.
Cash only. Would definitely recommend.</Review>< pics>

After get my sandwich I was eating it out side in my car. And i saw an customer going in to the subway without mask and she didn’t told her to go back for her mask. So white people it’s allowed to be inside the restaurant with out mask.< /review><gmap_id>0x80ec6c8baec95975:0x562a78df8ef2366d< /gmap_id>< userid>

When I told her it seemed a little inappropriate to me she snapped at me again and walked away. Oh well, it's a good thing I have lots of choices. Geting 2 stars because the other sandwich maker made a great sandwich.< /Review><Time>1543522976674<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<review>Daniel Gonzalez and Julian were very well mannered and humbled young men who took our order one late Saturday night as we were craving pork fries in a busy long line. The food was amazing but the best part was the customer service we received they don't make young men like this anymore so humble and grateful to be working on a busy Saturday night. Their response to a busy Saturday night was they are just trying to make sb happy by serving them at only best spot open 24hrs. I told them I wanted to leave a review because they were awesome. Keep people like this around sb needs it<//review>< Time>

This place used to be good.  Now its just over priced. I ordered a deluxe meat fry with nacho cheese. It was more grease than anything.  I ate as much as I did because I was starving and it took forevert to get through the line ! But I'm not going to go again. The white stuff was supposed to be sour cream. Overall 🤢🤮🤧<//Review>

<Review>The drive thru line is outrages, i was in line for half an hr... All that food is precooked there's no reason for it to take that long to get orders out at night, they should know what their busiest days and times are.

The food 😒 disappointing!! i ordered Chile verde fries with both kind of cheese,  and what i got was fries with watery  nacho cheese, skipped the shredded cheese and chile Verde and 2 pieces of dry pork meat ...

Do better 🙏🏼...Amapola  has been an  SB Favorite for ever!!
Better yet open the original one on 5th, 24hrs 🤞</Review></record></dataset><record>

Me and my boyfriend always get menudo from here. It's like our date spot. Even tho there is no inside dining right now. Lately they have been giving way more bones than actual soup but I am still happy with what I get. It's starting to become a family thing because my whole family goes. Huge reason....they are open 24/7.  A but pricey for location and options but I still recommend definitely!!< /Text>

<Text>Went through drive through about 10:00 pm, service was fast. Felix meat fries were like warm. Presentation, not very pleasing to the eye as food spilled out of containers napkins not useable.  Overall food was good . I would still go back my friend offered enchilada and a chille relleno looked good.<//Text>< Date>

Solid Mexican and Cali-Mexican staples. Taco Bender across the street had a "B" rating in the window, so Amapola for the win!</review>

Because of our not so good governor we can only get take out or drive through AGAIN but Amapola did a really good job of putting up barriers at the order window and clearly marked social distancing marks. Their employees were very kind and professional. The food is always EXCELLENT. My wife got the 2 taco dinner and loved it and I got an Al Pastor burrito that was awesome! No matter what you order you will not be disappointed!< /Review>

Be prepared to wait just a little while as food is prepared to order. Food is really tasty but if you don't like spice remember to say something. I'm total gringa and my tacos left a bit of a bite.</review>

<text>Let me tell you, this meal right here was fire 🔥
I got (meat fries) chicken w/nacho cheese, and of course I got 6 cups of green salsa (they're tiny) which I pour all over my meal lol
And their bean and cheese burritos are fire too.
Total w/tax & w/o a drink $11 and some change
They accept American express<//text>< Time>

Well... at least it's better than the Taco Bender... that's not saying much though. Someone needs to teach both these places how to make enchiladas. It's pretty sad. 😑👎< /Text>

<review>Their Al pastor isn't really Al pastor, it's carnitas. Their marinade is not Al pastor marinate, nor is the meat spit roasted. Unless they made a mistake on my order and gave me carnitas. The burrito was pretty big for $5.75, and it was ok, nothing to boast about, but a 11:30 pm, it did its job. The tacos were pretty good, albeit, the meat was a tad bit dried. Not bad when you want a quick Mexican fix late at night. But I would not come here during the day when better options are available.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMepkp0YJm3doO-h9t54y1-aLfRBY1eMD65uYTe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPymnkWA2Osu9zwzMrZKJ7pwnRYS4KXio0kDZV-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Horrible experience there. I deliver for Post Mates and Door Dash and this is the ONLY place I've been to where they can't figure out how to charge for the food. It's happened 3 separate times when they are not able to process the transaction after me having waited for at least 15 minutes because of how slow they are. This last time, they charged me the wrong amount and when they tried to charge the correct amount, the card wouldn't go through anymore. They wanted me to pay out of pocket for the difference. Why would I pay out of pocket for food that wasn't even mine? They rather lose the sale and waste the food then just give me the food minus the 2 dollars that was due, even though it was their mistake in the first place! I ended up having to cancel the order, so I wasted 30 minutes of my time and didn't get paid anything due to their incompetence. They shouldn't be offering food delivery if they can't get it together there!! Extremely upsetting!<//review>

Love coming in for tacos! The chicharron and al pastor are my absolute favorite. The agua frescas are delicious, pina is my go to but cucumber lemonade was delicious also. There's almost always tables available, even during lunch hour and very rarely is there more than 10 minute wait to order. They also have a drive thru.<//Review>

<Text>At one time, we were San Bernardino residents 30…years ago.  The pork hot burrito still taste the same.  The flavor is in the pots and the same as the bean and cheese burrito!

Grew up coming to this place. It used to be better but it’s still okay. I just wanted to put out a warning about the kids meal. I had a to go order of 2 kids bean and cheese burritos. I wasn’t expecting anything huge, but at least a normal size kids burrito.
These burritos were literally laughable. They could be finished in 3 bites by my kids. Of all the places I have ever ordered a kids meal, this was the most ridiculous. If I had eaten in the restaurant I would have definitely complained. Since I was already at home when I saw them, we just laughed but we will never order those again!<//review>

<text>The food is good  and service too, although today they took longer than usual to give my order. Also since my friend and I order from the menu because we didn't want to pay buffet menu we had to eat outside in a 100 degree plus weather!, I think they should have a section inside for people who just want to order from the menu on Saturdays and Sundays during buffet hours. But yeah food was good</text></record>

The girl at the drive thru was rude..and I ordered a quesadilla plate and porkfries and 2 waters I paid $20 and I got a plate of pork fries and even though they asked me what kind of cheese and I said nacho they didn't even put any cheese and for the quesadilla plate all I got was a flour tortilla with cheese nothing else even though the plate obviously has rice and beans we didn't notice till we got home cause we were being rushed she even rolled her eyes when I asked for salsa the only reason they get 1 star is cause horchata is always bomb...</review>

<review>I enjoy their food. But you know it would be great if you could have a vegetarian rice and beans option. If you did then your vegetarian dishes could actually be vegetarian. I and many others would eat there much more frequently. (Just a wish) so now, I don’t eat there but wish I could.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c35302b0cb3cf3:0xfba7aa498528afbd<//gmap_id></record>

There meat does not have fat which I loved because I don't like fat in my meat. I also tried their enchiladas they were delicious same goes for their nachos. The employees were cooperative. By that I mean we had a little misunderstanding with one employee but she was great in keeping her cool and tried her best to satisfy out needs. Over all it's a good place.</text>

Food went down hill do not buy Al pastor it is soaked in grease and has no flavor except fat. The nachos now have been coming with old greasey chips and the Chile Verde is no longer chunky. It is like they don't care any more. Barf!< /Text>

Haven't been here in years the decor has been updated and I'm liking the look. The service was great and polite. I ordered the number 13 dinner combo plate. I chose a chili relleno and shredded beef enchilada it comes with beans and rice. The order came out pretty fast cause I was the only one there but they were handling drive threw also. Food was delicious and made my morning. Thank you workers.<//Text>

Had a issue with one of the employees but honestly, I think Amapola is one of the top bombest place to eat in San Bernardino. So as long as the food stays great then nothing else matters.<//Review>

I had a special Asada burrito, it was ok. I wouldn't buy it again. I also had a large fries that weren't cooked all the way so if you order fries order them cooked well done or extra crispy. Won't be going back<//review>

<Text>One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I went in all happy because I was finally going to eat after a long day, boy was I wrong. I ordered two burritos and two drinks, but apparently they have a combo meal for cheaper and I was not told this. I have worked at a fast-food restaurant, and when the customer wanted a entree and a drink, I always made it into a combo to save the customer a little bit of money. This Amapola employees apparently do not care to keep their customer happy. So I ask the girl if she can just charge me that deal, and instead I get charged extra, which is absolutely insane. They are robbing me from my money. Okay so I get the food, and the burrito is not how I ordered it. I asked for beans and rice and no tomatoes or condiments, my burrito came with no beans, rice, and it came with a lot of condiment, mind you that I did not want any condiments in the first place. So I go to a manager, which I believe his name is Edwin, and I say that the girl got my order wrong and I'll like to get a new burrito as I wanted it. He told me that it couldn't be changed since I bit, but how was I supposed to know that they were going to get my order wrong? So he told me that he could charge me extra to add beans and rice to the burrito, now I am just furious. I told him why, this is not what i paid for, how hard is it to satisfy a customer? To get them what they paid for, and not charged extra. He later said that he could add the rice and beans to the burrito, but the condiments would still be there. At that point, I did not feel like arguing back and forth with this guy. I did not even finish half of the burrito because I had lost my appetite and it was not what I ordered. So I left with being extra charged, really mad, and with horrible customer service. Amapola really needs to know what great customer service is. What made me mad the most that I was charged extra! For something that I did not ask for. Never going back.</Text>< Pics>

This is one of my favorite places to go to get authentic Spanish food. I love their weekend mornings buffet. They catered an event I went to and that was awesome as well. The Chile Verde pork burrito with no beans and rice but with queso is my ultimate favorite. Watch out it is HOT! But that makes it so good because you cant stop eating even though it burns!! I love it! Their drinks are amazing too. The horchata is already an over the top favorite but their Peppino "cucumber" lemonade, tamarind, and Jamaica juices are the best in the business. The best in the western region Nv, Az, and Ca. Love this place!!!<//text>

Nothing fancy about this place but if you are looking for  some great tasting food this is the place for you. I have been eating here 30 plus years. I will literally  drive an hour out off my way to eat a Pork Hot Burrito or Pork Nachos. My absolute favorite. There is just something  so good about their green sauce.< /Text>

One cashier argued me down about the price of my order the I ordered often that I knew only came up to 5 dollars but  was trying to charge me 10 dollars for!!🤦🏾‍♀️</Text>< pictures>

<text>I've lived in the Inland Empire for more than 35 years I've been going to Amapola for about 25 years I've always put Amapola as the Best Mexican food restaurant in the Inland Empire, But I would say a year from now, I've been finding fruit flies, hair on my food,  I don't go back & let them know!! I let it slide but this has happened about 4 times, I think the customer service should be more amicable / friendlier from the workers, don't get me wrong the food is delicious but I don't know what's going on with the restaurant cleanliness, I believe they need to be more on top of That!!< /text></record>

Everything here is delicious 😋 Chile Verde is sometimes pretty spicy.. Be careful. Sour cream does wonders! Enjoy!< /review>

<review>Best menudo ever. What happened to the Tamarind drink? I'm still to feel like it's McDonald's. Ice cream machine is always broken. I been there different times like 2am, 7am, 12pm, and Ben there different time and days of the weeks and no Tamarind drink. It's been months. Other than that, food is great.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Normally I Love This Place. They Usually Have Really Good Food. & Honestly It Wasn't Any Different. Still Really Good. However They Messed Up My Order Just A Tiny Bit. I Ordered Floutas & They Gave Me Taquitos. Which Is Why It Is Not 5 Stars But Still Really Good & Fair Prices.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>We normally love this place. It's our go to place when we are in town. But today's visit was horrible. We ordered to go because that's their ONLY OPTION on weekends, and our food was horrible. Burrito fell apart on first bite, sons quesadilla was not even melted just a pile of cheese in the tortilla.  Hoping for a better visit next time.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>I got the special burrito and Chile rienno .and the special burrito ...Nothing special about it $9.00 for a basic burrito there was no sour cream no guacamole and hardly any cheese I was so disappointed that I asked them to put sour cream and guac. But they wanted to charge me an extra 2 dollars. So you want me to pay like 10 bucks for a burrito are you crazy? Then the place looks like a restaurant but they served our food on Styrofoam!$! .sure has changed from when I was a kid going there with my mother.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
This morning I went to buy some menudo it was around 7:30, yes the service was faster but the menudo taste like it was from the day before.
Usually is pretty good but today no it was not good.
I don't recommend to go early in the morning for menudo because it might be from the day before.</Review>

The line wasn't very long when I went 3:30pm ish. The person taking my order spoke clear and got my order correct. The man at the window was polite and personable. He also was very attentive to my condiments requests all with a smile. All around great experience the food was delicious. Well worth the price I forked out to get my grub on lol.< /review>

<text>I think this is the few last authentic Mexican food taste you can get in sb, I go here for the tacos they are good to me my husband don't like them but who cares I do, me and my son have been going here since he was 5 and he only eats this Mexican food. I just don't like the workers some are lazy some are rude and sometimes they close before closing time or they make you leave how rude other then that it's 👌</text></record>

First of all,  they never give you you're whole order. They always forget something.
I spoke to the lady at the window about them forgetting some items and they said they cant do nothing about it.
I paid for 2 plates of birria dinners and a side of fries.  I feel like I've been robbed.  They stole 20 bux from me. I feel horrible.</review>

The food was very good but the service was very bad. They were at least 15 cars in drive-thru so I went in to put my order in and there were only four people ahead of me. That's when I saw drive through took priority. The cashier was overwhelmed because when I left there were at least 11 people inside waiting. There were two sometimes three people helping drive through by taking orders and helping bag food. There was only one cashier for the walk-in/takeout people. She was taking orders, getting food ready, making drinks doing it all and it took forever because she was left to sink or swim. My food sat up on the ready counter for 7 minutes instead of somebody coming and bagging it for her  to get us out, it just sat there and that's how it  was for every one of the customers in there. All they were worried about was drive thru. That's not fair just because we came in and ordered.  Dive-thru should not always take priority because we're customers too.</text>

<text>Crappy customer service. I feel like they want me to be grateful that they are serving me because they are such awesome food servers ... not!!! You can't tell them anything or they will spit on your food. Chili's TGI Friday places like that that know customer service where your visit is welcomed with great customer service. These guys just walking around shooting the s*** like I am NOT welcome. If you like this kind of customer service keep going. This will be my last time going there and I hope to see these f****** out of business. Sick of going to a place where these people are not happy about how much they make don't take pride in their position . That's their problem not mine. Expect customer service like all the good restaurants. If I don't get it I stopped going to those s***** places.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Went for mother's day brunch. It was the last hour until they clean things up and the cashier was very rude about us getting the buffet. She kept rolling her eyes and giving us looks like we were bothering her. She was telling us that we only had 30 minutes left when we really had 45 minutes left. Then she took forever to take our order which made it even less time for us to eat, like if she was taking her time on purpose. Also, they dont give you your fountain drink when you order. You have to go in another line and wait for that. The workers were all over the place. It wasnt organized, which made production slower.</review>

Really good carne asada burrito. Service is slow but they are nice. Everytime I order extra things in my burrito I never get it. Happened twice. I told the cashier and she said they would fix it. They didn't.  Don't bother ordering extra anything for your burrito, you won't get it even though you pay for it.</Text>

Great food IF they get your order right.
Just got home with my wet burrito. I asked for it with rice and beans inside and red sauce on top. When I was paying she read the order back to me and said there was beans and cheese inside and I told her it was fine since they had already made it. Get home and its covered in GREEN sauce.
Wasted money.< /text>

<text>Buffet was so disorganized, they keep charging people for the buffet but there is no where to sit, but not to worry because you can sit outside in the 90 degree weather. Was grossed out by the left over food they serve as a buffet.

<Text>Second time I visited this place. The first was based on stars I saw online, figured it be a good place. The first time, we went through the drive thru. I figured the lady was having a bad day and thought  nothing of it. This second time around we caught the same attitude from the same drive thru. Customer service is everything, and this place seems to lack it. The food is pretty good, but portions suck for the price. Attitude that you get here makes you wonder if they spit in your food. Two times is enough for me. Will not be going back for a third.< /Text>< pics>

I received the best service ever.  My husband always has lots of question and the gentleman running the front was wonderful.  I think his a manager. It's hard to find great service in San Bernardino so we eat out side the city. Best service and great food by far.< /Text>

Great food. My favorite are the crispy tacos. Cons about this place is that the lines are sometimes long including the drive-in. But great thing about it is that the drive-in is open 24/7. Have gone there a few minutes pass New Year's Eve and they are still open.<//Text>

<Time>1484449676278< /Time><Rating>4</Rating><review>They're nice. I've only done the drive-thru but if you don't ask her rice and beans all you get his meat in your burrito, and it is very very good. I have had the burrito with rice and beans and it is the bomb. So I've only tried the burritos but that's usually a good indicator of the quality of the spot and I would say trying everything here would be worthwhile. Nothing special inside just a fast food joint, but the food is on point.

Expect a very long line at lunch time< /review>< pictures>

The food is very good here. The service is iffy. This place is notorious for getting your order wrong or forgetting something every time I go through the drive thru. Also, they need to send someone to power wash the entire perimeter, it needs it badly. But, like I said, the food is delicious 😋.</text>

I am glad we found this place, the employees are very nice and the food was tasty. They have a buffet spread Saturdays and Sundays only for a very reasonable price. The environment is great with Mexican music playing in the background. My favorite was the pozole with pata.< /Text>

The employees were loud in back,  playing,  distracting.  The counter associates were helpful,  but also distracted.  Man counting money didn't acknowledge a question.  Felt uncomfortable waiting on food.  And order wasn't right with extra cheese.  Too expensive for the quality of food and service.</text>

<Review>So I went through the drive thru and ordered food that needs either a spoon or a fork.  I got neither.  Are we supposed to ask for forks and spoons ? I'll just add to my last review. I waited 45 minutes in the drive-thru, I ordered a pork burrito with rice, almost $9 and NO RICE.< /Review>< GmapID>

The food is nowhere near good as it used to be. The customer service is terrible. We waited in line for a drink refill and no one would serve us and then another man walked up for a refill and they waited on him immediately and we still had to ask for service to get our soda refilled. Won't be back.</text>

One of my ultimate favorite mexican places in the I.E. Their food is delicious good priced and a hearty serving. When they are super busy they might get something wrong (add onion when I said no onion) but they always fix it no questions asked so no big deal to me.< /Text>

<text>Waited 25 minutes in the drive thru, and the line wasn't even that long. Once I got my food it was cold, as if it was sitting under a fan while I waited in the drive thru. When I took a bite it was just tortilla on one side and cold meat on the other. I remember this place being good, but there are many other options in San berdo then to go here again.< /text>< response>

The Guy Working drive thru night shift has the absolute worst attitude ever! He got mad & caught an attitude with me cause I called them to tell them they got my order wrong. I asked for pork fries with BOTH cheeses, you get charged extra for both cheeses by the way. So when I opened my food I got the pork fries without the cheese. So basically just the fries with meat on top. I’ve got the same guy on 2 other occasions & I got the same worst attitude ever!<//review>

I love amapolas menudo ! Burritos have somehow became smaller but still good , but you have to pay extra for beans and rice . Pork fries are really good too .< /review>

It's probably one of the best Mexican food places in the IEi its a little pricey, but it's worth every cent. It's definitely in the top 5 places to get the best,
most authentic Mexican food.</review>

<Review>The Guy Working drive thru night shift has the absolute worst attitude ever! He got mad & caught an attitude with me cause I called them to tell them they got my order wrong. I asked for pork fries with BOTH cheeses, you get charged extra for both cheeses by the way. So when I opened my food I got the pork fries without the cheese. So basically just the fries with meat on top. I’ve got the same guy on 2 other occasions & I got the same worst attitude ever!</Review>< pictures>

Always check your order before driving away.  They might miss something. And be ready to wait a while at the drive thru.  There food is good but not consistent.<//Review>

I use to like this place a whole lot before I moved to the OC. The quality of food and service has gone down. I normally go in to order,but I  went after 11pm. I went through the drive thru and got a watered down horchata. I have to stop and get another drink since by the time I took my first drink I was on the fwy to the OC. Just diappointing.< /Review>

They suck if you go late night. And then when you call about it they hang up on you. Thanks Ernesto on night shift for your wonderful service.</Review>

Very bad service! The nigth crew do not care how they serve the food. We order a menudo it was cold, we ask to please heat it on the microwave and it took to long to give it back! And it was cold by then😑 again. And my burrito the flour tortilla was cold and stiff as well. The lemons they serve where rotten😝 sorry but I won't be back. It's not the first time it happens.< /Text>

As close as you can get to "authentic Mexican food" in this San Bernardino area. Not the best but ehhh, the pork chile verde fries with nacho cheese are the best! Must have! If you choose Drive thru be patient you will be in line about 10-25 mins. Make sure you check how much salsa you're given you might get one, none or barely enough.</Text>

The food is good. I come here when I am craving Mexican food. I have lived in the area a good while. If ur expecting to get a quick bite do not come here. You will wait 10 minutes or more. Ive waited almost 30 minutes one time and unable to leave the drive thru because there was a car behind me blocking me. Their customer service, one word, HORRIBLE! Usually women that work here are so rude dont smile from taking your order to when they greet you at the window. Owners should randomly go through drive thru to see what experience their customers are receiving or do something about how bad customer service is. Employees they look like they hate their jobs and are just waiting to be off. There is room for a lot of improvement. Or they should look at the management they have because management is allowing for this horrible customer service to continue.</text>

Don’t use the Drive through.
The workers don’t speak english so they will get your order wrong.
If you drive all the way back to the restaurant to ask them to correct the mistake, they will give you an attitude, charge you a second time and spit in you food.< /text>

thought I found our place. No way will I go to Amapola again. I ordered a carne asada burrito, Chile Colorado (chunky beef), the #4 plate and two extra tacos. I wanted 12 of those small 1" red sauces. I was told by Edgar (man who took my order) that he would only give me 2 sauces per burrito and only 1 per taco. I thought he was joking but no. After that I told him that I would pay for more sauces. It looked like he thought of a number out of his head then told me it would be $0.70 per sauce... Wow! I can not believe that. I usually go to a couple of different Amapola's (including the one near my son's school Indian Springs HS). Because of my experience with Edgar's so obvious made up price and poor service I will no longer be going to either of the three. Edgar... here is a bit of advice... learn a little business sense. Do not allow 20 cents worth of sauce on a $23 order cause Amapola to lose customers such as you did today. You have lost your company hundreds over the next year and if you continue to do this to customers maybe thousands year over year. As we all know, there are plenty of places to eat in SB. Places like Rosa Maria's, Albertos, Gus Jr, Mi Cucina, Paco's Tacos, Taco Bender... and many others. If you don't want our business, believe me the others do.< /review>

<Review>This "Mexican food" lacks authenticity, their nachos con Asada are a joke, the Asada meat was dry, the chips they use are thin and tasted like clay, and the only topping they come with is your choice of shredded or nacho cheese. I was expecting what I'm used to at other Mexican food restaurants sour cream, cheese, guacamole, beans and real fried tortilla chips< /Review>< pics>

The food is good but they are extremely slow your wait in the drive thru is always 20 to 40 minutes it doesn't seem to matter if there are 2 cars or 7.</Review>
