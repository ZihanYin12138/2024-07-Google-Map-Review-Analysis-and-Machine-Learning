Love this place. The food is consistently great and the staff are extremely friendly. We eat breakfast here almost every Sunday unless we're out of town. It can get a bit busy at times but usually it's comfortable.

You can either order at the counter and they'll bring your food and drinks to you, or you can grab a menu and order from the comfort of your table,</review>

<Review>The other Crepevines have a Gluten Free menu, but this location did not have any gluten free options. The crab cakes I ordered left a lot to be desired. Also, they didn't have egg options, like an all egg white omelet. How simple is that? And they didn't offer that. Again, I was disappointed and I won't be returning to that particular Crepevine< /Review>< GmapID>

I love this place.  The staff is amazing - always welcoming, helpful and even during busy busy times, remain smiling and efficient.  My favorites are the chicken vegetable soup, the asian chicken salad and the crepes.  Well worth a visit - you may have found a new 'home'.</review>

<Text>I like this place a lot. Food is good, not expensive, and the staff is amazing. And of course, the crepes are really good, specially the salmon one.

Decoration and layout are on the more basic side, but that's also part of the charm.<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><text>2017.Dec.17 well it was time to renew the leasing and rent has gone up and Crepevine is closing. I was informed today. I will miss the staff as  we became friends. Hope they all have a smoothly, profitable transition into the next thing, the next service. "The way things are going we will all be driving for uber" "oh, no. Cars are coming without need for drivers" (laughs). It was
fun to be with the locals as I constantly heard "nice seeing you "

<text>Mostly plain food, delapidaded decor in a prime location.

It definitely fills the hole, and it is convenient but it is nothing to write home about.

I don't think there is one standout dish that I could say, please try this!

A pity that this corridor is not better populated in terms of restaurants.

It is a prime location with muni stopping here</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f7e1e7cb86733:0xbd66bba294010b64<//gmap_id></record>

I LOVE Crepevine on Church Street. Crepevine is an inexpensive and  casual Castro neighborhood restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner seven days a week. I usually spend $12 to $16 on a meal (with drinks and tip). While they have a wide selection of savory and sweet crepes, it's their huge fresh salads, delicious burgers and sandwiches, and big three egg omelettes and immensely satisfying eggs benedictions that keep people coming back for more. My favorites are the Eggs Benedict - Costa Del Sol  (sautéed ham, spinach and onions with poached eggs on an english muffin with hollandaise sauce and hash browns), the Pasta Palermo with chicken (fettuccine with alfredo sauce, roasted garlic, chicken breast and parmesan cheese), and the freshly prepared Cancun Salad (romaine lettuce with corn, black beans, red onions and bell peppers tossed with balsamic vinaigrette, served over a tortilla and topped with freshly grilled chicken breast and mango salsa). They offer freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee or tea, soft drinks and wine to drink - and lots of desserts to please any palate . You order and pay at the counter, choose your table, and your food and beverages are served shortly thereafter. While the servers take your order at the counter, they do an excellent job keeping the table clean, delivering food, and topping up drinks. Don't forget to tip them! I know you'll love Crepevine as much as I do. Cheers!</Review>

<Review>A very simple spot to get good food. If you're willing to get up out of your seat once in awhile and ordering upfront you can get a LARGE portion meal for very rerasonable prices, and the service at this restaurant is significantly better than any ala carte/full service restaurant in the area.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A great place to start the day in the morning. Very good food . Top quality. Nice staff and very good value for money.
We were also here in the evening.
There are very large and good salads here.
The sandwiches are also recommended.
Are more likely to be a burger!

<rate>5</rate><review>I only have good things to say about my experiences at this office. First of all, the people that run the front desk, namely Tanya and Vanessa are very friendly and helpful.  Lari, the dental hygienist is excellent!  Liz, who was my main “nurse, caretaker, doer of all things” is so attentive and tuned in to what I was going through.  She really took excellent care of me.  Marissa assisted on one occasion and I felt very comfortable in her presence.    And Dr. Grant, who extracted  a molar, filled a cavity, and inserted two dental implants, is absolutely amazing at his craft!  He operates will a steady, sure hand and with a calm and confident energy about him.  I was able to relax (as much as I’d possible in this case) knowing that I was in great hands with Dr. Grant and Liz.   I give them 5 stars!<//review>< pics>

<Text>I really like my dentist, Dr. Grant,  and the entire staff! I am so happy to have found them! They are up to date and very knowledgeable and are so reassuring. I actually LIKE going to the dentist now! I always come home with a smile. If one wants a great dentist and a good dental experience, I highly recommend checking them out!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>106863980987783071134< /userid>< Rate>

Dr. Weiser and his team are awesome. I have to say Thank You to Michelle, Liz and Sheri for making our visit super pleasant. My 11yr old had teeth extracted and the entire process from the time we checked in to the time we checked out was so warm and welcoming. Dr. Weiser and his staff are awesome at what they do. I would recommend anyone to see them.< /text>

Dr Weiser and his staff are wonderful. Dr. Weiser is compassionate and listens to me. It’s great to have a dentist that uses ozone and non toxic materials. He did a really good job fixing my fillings. I feel happy to have him as a dentist and greatly appreciate his expertise.</Text>

<Review>The receptionist was cheerful, courteous, and warmly interactive. The dentist’s cubicle was clean and uncluttered; the chair was comfortable. While usually going to the dentist is unpleasant, I was relieved, reassured, and wonderfully treated.<//Review></record>

Dr. Weisser and his team are truly amazing. I originally saw Dr. Weisser to have my mercury fillings removed and replaced. They use the most efficient equipment to do this procedure, and they do it in the safest way possible, while being environmentally responsible. The staff is very friendly, caring, and compassionate, and since I have always been nervous going to the dentist, this is very important to me. They use nitrous oxide if needed to take the edge off, which really helps me with my anxiety. I can honestly say that it was a pleasant experience;  something I never thought I would say about a dentist appointment!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Although I have been coming to Dr. Weiser (and now, ‘and Grant’), for some time, the cost has risen to the point where I must use someone who takes my insurance for a filling and some other work that simply costs more than I want to spend out of pocket. Especially since we have to pay for insurance anyway. It’s sad to move on from a good dental office, but it’s necessary.< /Text>< pictures>

Mercury fillings(3) removed: Dr. Weiser and his assistant Holly made this experience one I can rave about! The experience was pleasant overall, yes, pleasant! I did not experience any pain through the procedure, was constantly checked on, and most importantly, I felt secure with the process of safely removing amalgam. I am so glad I went forward with this decision! If you're considering having your amalgam removed, don't wait, go to Dr. Weiser! You won't regret having amalgam removed by him!< /Review>

Dr. Weiser has been my dentist since 1985, except for a few years when I was working in LA, and could not be in Santa Barbara for dental work. Mark has a staff of excellent dental hygienists and administrative staff that work with his patients to make sure they are well taken care of in terms of both preventive dental care and whatever other procedures are needed to resolve their dental problems. Mark has always kept his level of dental expertise and skills on the leading edge of dental care technology as his primary objective is to provide his patients with the best dental care available within the dental care industry at a reasonable cost.His office has the latest technology and tools needed to provide a very high level of dental care. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for the best dental care available in Santa Barbara.< /Text>

My daughternna college student in Santa Barbara broke her front tooth.I live in The Bay Area.She was devastated and booked appointment with the random dentist not knowing that dentists specialize in different types of dentistry.I called Dr. Weiser's office and I am glad I did.I spent with the receptionists there around 2 hours  asking questions,explaining the situation,calling them again for an appointment,then cancelling and again asking for an appointment.I am grateful to Bonnye for her patience,willingness to help,understanding my daughter's situation and for her knowledge in explaining about how my daughter can be helped.She found the time to book us for an appointment although their schedule was probably full until next week.Nevertheless she found time and all worked out well.
My daughter is happy with her tooth and I felt confident that she was in good hands.Thank you,Dr.Weiser for my daughter's positive experience and Thank you very much, Bonnye and others (sorry,forgot the names)for your immense help. You deserve 10 stars!<//review>

My initial appointment with Dr Weiser and staff could not have been more positive. The combination of professionalism and personability was unsurpassable, and I felt immediately assured by Dr. Weiser's calm, friendly, professional chair-side manner. He fielded all my questions, and provided information beyond what I requested. I left with a sound plan of action and reasonable payment arrangements.<//review>

What an extraordinary dentist! I wish I had known of Dr. Weiser 30 years ago! But I am so grateful to work with him now. There is no one like him in Santa Barbara -- or even in the rest of California, as I have been to a dozen dentists. He is the most knowledgable dentist and up to date on the most progressive dentistry. He will save your gums and make your teeth beautiful!!</Text>

<Review>Internet reviews can be helpful in many cases, but sometimes they are intentionally misleading, leaving the business with no way to rebut.  Having said that, I would love to share with all of you in Santa Barbara about a wonderful and exceptionally gifted dentist you have in Dr. Mark Weiser.

As a dentist myself, I have had the opportunity to work with Dr. Weiser in several advanced hands-on continuing education courses.  I have seen first hand how gifted he is with his clinical skills, from cosmetic dental makeovers, to sleep apnea and the ever increasing use of Botox to treat TMJ pain as well as head and neck pain.

While Dr. Weiser's clinical skills are exceptional, his people skills and bedside manner are equally as caring and sincere.  I know that you in Santa Barbara have a choice when it comes to selecting a dentist, but you will not find a more gifted and caring professional than Dr. Weiser.  He is without question, one of Santa Barbara's leading and highly trained dentists.  If you or your loved ones are looking for an exceptional Santa Barbara dentist.....look no further.  One visit with Dr. Weiser and you will instantly know.....you are home!</Review>< rate>

From the moment I walked in, I knew I was in a place that I could trust. But first, let me write about what a beautiful office it is and how welcoming and aesthetically pleasing it is. They took time with the design and decor and what's even better Annie at the front desk is friendly and ready to help.
Then meeting Dr Zarrabi for the first time was awesome. He was so easygoing and attentive. He listens and offers options to what treatments can be done all with a smile and a great demeanor.
All in all, the 45 minutes I spent here were helpful, I was equipped with answers to my questions and to be honest, eager to go back to for my next appointment because I know I am well care for at this office.</Review>

I love this man and his staff. I bless the day I met him. My arm lift has changed my life. I don’t have to worry about what shawl or sweater I have to wear with sleeveless dresses and tops anymore. The surgery went perfectly and the aftercare has been wonderful. I NEVER feel rushed when seeing him and the best thing about my post-op visit yesterday was getting to hug this gifted and sweet man since we were both fully vaccinated!!</Review>

I love Dr. Zarrabi. He is an amazing surgeon and is very skilled.  He truly cares about his patients an makes you feel very comfortable!  He takes the time to list to your concerns and checks in frequently.  I am also a physician and I am not used to being a patient.  He has an excellent bedside manner and is very thorough.

I am very happy with my surgery results and would recommend him to anybody.  His staff is wonderful and he is genuinely a great guy.<//Review>

I recently took my 15 year old son to have a mole removed. From the first phone call I made to schedule the appointment to checking out his staff is professional and kind. Dr. Zarrabi himself is patient, knowledgeable and caring. He gave us a very conservative plan that will best protect my son. I am grateful for his care. I highly recommend this office.< /Text>

I only went to Dr. Zarrabi for my consultation and haven't yet had my surgery but I had one of the best experiences I've ever had with a doctor. He was patient, kind, thorough. He answered every question I had and never rushed me once. He went through insurance possibilities with me and explained all of my options at length. I hope I can schedule my surgery with him soon.</Review>

Dr. Zarrabi is a great plastic surgeon. He did my facelift 2yrs ago and it still looks amazing. I maintain my youthful appearance by visiting his nurse practitioner Sherry Sanvictores . Her botox and filler skills are truly amazing. The compliments I get are so nice. Thank you to everyone at Dr Zarrabi office .< /text>

< Review>
There aren't enough good things to say about Dr. Zarrabi and his staff.

After 2 babies, gaining and then losing weight, I decided I wanted to feel young and beautiful again, and part of that for me, was finding a plastic surgeon for a tummy tuck.  I had consults with 3 other doctors by the time I met Dr. Zarrabi.  Both my husband and I agreed within 5 minutes of ending our virtual consultation that he was the right choice for me. He spent so much time just talking me through the entire procedure, risks and benefits and answering all our questions with patience and kindness.

My procedure was in December 2020. It is the absolute BEST invest I've ever made for myself and I would choose Dr. Zarrabi again and again. I have received excellent aftercare, which for me was almost as important as the procedure itself. Dr. Zarrabi even facetimed me on his family holiday vacation a few days after my surgery! You couldn't get any better care.  The staff in the office is professional and so sweet, and truly make visits to the office enjoyable.

If you are considering a procedure with Dr. Zarrabi, I would tell you that there is no better choice, in my opinion.</Review>

Dr. Zarrabi and his entire team could not have been more warm and welcoming. A big reason I chose to go to Dr. Zarrabi were due to his amazing reviews. He definitely lives up to them.

This was my first surgery, and not only did him and his team make me feel at ease, but they look the time to listen and educate me. I never felt rushed or pressured into doing anything I wasn’t comfortable with, and I must say that post surgery, I feel amazing!

Thank you guys for everything❤️

Dr Zarrabi was recommended to me over a year ago by a satisfied customer - everything she said to me has been spot on!  His staff is top notch - more supportive than you can imagine.

During these weird times I was able to have a virtual consultation with Dr. Zarrabi, and he is nothing short of amazing! Such a kind and warm-hearted individual. He answered all of my questions and went over everything very thoroughly. He is so knowledgeable and has loads of patience. Looking forward to my surgery with him and his lovely team :)</Review>

Sherry is absolutely extremely talented - knows exactly how to still keep you looking natural but gives your face back it’s glow - shape- youthful look in a safe -caring manner.  In addition - the office staff makes you feel so welcome right when you walk in. I would not go anywhere else!< /Text>

Dr Zarrabi is so amazing...to my dismay, I had a cosmetic procedure that went terribly wrong with another doctor.  After 18 months I decided to fix the issues.  Dr Zarrabi spent 2 hours with me consulting, even though he had patients waiting.  I was so terribly distraught from my previous surgery & the thought of going through all the pain & discomfort went away after coming to him.  He made me feel optimistic & secure we could fix the problems.  I can not emphasize enough how truly sincere, kind & realistic Dr Zarrabi & his staff are. Don't spend another moment thinking....he is 200% the right choice!!!!<//Review>

<text>So far, it has just been a consultation, but I had a great experience. It's reassuring that they have my best interests, especially in a superficial market like cosmetic surgery. I can tell that their focus is on my happiness and not on my wallet. I didnt feel pressed into anything and genuinely feel like Dr. Zarrabi was there to collaborate with me on the outcomes of my body with the right balance of care and directness. Ariel has warm communication and people skills.
Surgery can be scary but I am confident I am in good hands here :)

However, if you're not used to cities, show up very early, it's a little hard to find if you're not used to the setup. I got lost, and they helped with that too lol< /text>< GmapID>

He is the best.
The most important thing about Dr. Zarabi is that he makes you feel at home and treats you like family.
He is very professional and down to earth. Best of the best. He listens to his patients.
It's very hard to find someone who listens to you. He has an office with a very friendly environment and  a very professional staff.
To anyone looking for a top notch Plastic Surgeon, Dr. Zarabi is the full package.</text>< pics>

Dr. Zarrabi is absolutely stellar.  He has been an exceptional physician with the care of my hands, from successful surgery, to further diagnoses and treatments required over several years.  He is attentive, diligent, caring and is everything you could hope to find in a doctor.  He staff is consistently gracious and efficient, making every visit as stress-free as is possible. His office is lovely, in keeping with the entire quality of his practice. I highly recommend Dr. Zarrabi, without hesitation.<//Review>

Dr. Zarrabi is wonderful.  I can't say enough good things about him.  I've known him for eight years now and wouldn't trust anyone else.  Two of my family members have also been very happy patients of Dr. Zarrabi.  He is honest and caring and incredibly skilled.  His staff is also awesome!  His administrative staff, nurses and anesthesiologists are very kind and caring.  I would highly recommend Dr. Zarrabi to anyone.< /Review>

She also contacted 2 different family and friend  separately to come pick me up right when I entered the recovery room .  I was feeling anxious and in severe pain but she was the only one that didn't let my family know what was going on and released confidential information to my mom. That was very rude and she breached my privacy. She tried to get me out of recovery while I was half asleep. Rude and dissatisfied of her. She made my mom drive an hour and my friend as well both came to get me. We had over an hour long drive to get back home too and I was bleeding and in serious pain. I dont know her name but I can come identify her face older white nurse lady.  My team in surgery were awesome especially my doctor. After I got in recovery the shift changed and that's when everything went wrong from that one Nurse!<//review>< pictures>

From day one when I met Dr. Zarrabi and his staff in August 29 2019 they have all welcomed me and my husband like family. Very kind, warm, and educating myself and my husband on everything that we need to know and what was excepted. Dr. Zarrabi is very humble and wants the best for his patients. He is honest and allows his patients to feel comfortable. Annette a staff of Dr. Zarrabi helped me with any and all questions,  she is kind. Coming into the office your greeted with a smile.  And everyone that works there are very friendly and welcoming.  I got a mommy makeover along with a hernia repair.  The results exceeded my expectations.  I had done extensive research and sought out many reviews of other doctors and although he was recommended, I was glad to make the concious choice of picking him for my surgery.</Review>

I have heard wonderful things about him but PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE continue to read as I share my experience. . .   I was brought to the emergency room with a dog attack to the face and asked for the on call plastic to be called in to assist at the ER.  I was blessed that Dr. Zarrabi entered my life that night.
While Dr. Zarrabi worked for hours to repair my lower lip.  I had resigned myself that I would never be the same and that I would be the person in the grocery store that kids were afraid to look at.  (I am not being dramatic here. . .when the paramedics got to me they asked where the dog was so they could find my bottom lip)!!
After hours of patience and the most amazing bedside manner Dr. Zarrabi worked a miracle and I have healed to where people don't notice.  The journey was the most wonderful experience it could have possibly ever have been from the first introduction to being fully healed.
I have referred my loved ones to Dr. Zarrabi and he will remain my trusted physician for myself and anyone who is lucky enough to ask me for a referral< /review>< Pics>

<review>I met Dr. Michael Zarrabi 2 yrs ago in November 2013.
I was in need of a tummy tuck and was referred to him. Dr Zarrabi was very attentive to my needs and was very easy to talk to. He explained how the procedure was performed and answered all my questions.
I had my surgery on December 26, 2013.
It's been a little over two years now and I am satisfied with my results.
I would recommend Dr.Zarrabi to my friends.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I went to see Sherry for some fillers. She was fabulous! Since it was my first time seeing her, she spent time with me, explaining different types of fillers and options. She was extremely gentle and knowledgeable and I will definitely go back and refer my friends to her.

I have been to Sherry several times in the past year and each time she has been a great experience. I just saw her yesterday for a consult for some filler and she was very honest and told me that she didn't think I needed it at this time, and she advised me to wait. I appreciate her honesty and trust her implicitly! I also had a consult with Dr. Zarrabi for his thoughts on a cool-sculpting procedure.

They both made me feel comfortable and I will continue to see them. The ladies in the office are always welcoming and very professional.

Just had my first Laser treatment for brown spots on my face...I was a bit hesitant to have this procedure but Sherry assured me that I would be very pleased with the results. It has only been 3 days and I can already tell that my spots are less visible and some have disappeared!! It was also a painless procedure! She's the best!

Went to Sherry again for my second Laser treatment for sun spots on my chest. Once again she assured me it would be painless and it was. ONly day one and I am already seeing results.

Staff is very welcoming and helpful.  Dr. Zarrabi took his time on my consultation and explained everything in detail, asked if I had any questions and didn't mind answering them along with explanations. Should I choose to go through with the procedure I will write another review on how it went.<//text>

I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Zarrabi and his staff. He made me feel very comfortable at every step of my procedure. He explained everything very well and answered all my questions.  I have recommended him to all my friends, and I think that's the best compliment that I can give him, as well as a way to thank him for his attentive and caring nature. As far as his staff they are very polite, friendly, and helpful.</text>

He happened to be making rounds at Santa Monica Hospital, and he went to work ASAP. He worked quickly, with great precision, and he even kept a sense of humor. We talked throughout, making the surgery almost pleasant. And the outcome was pretty much perfect.

A couple of years later Michael Zarrabi removed a bone spur from my right thumb. Again, an experience which was as pleasant as it could have been (Michael is a fun guy) with a very good outcome.

Dr. Zarrabi gets 5 stars from me...</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I went to see Sherry for some fillers. She was fabulous! Since it was my first time seeing her, she spent time with me, explaining different types of fillers and options. She was extremely gentle and knowledgeable and I will definitely go back and refer my friends to her.

I have been to Sherry several times in the past year and each time she has been a great experience. I just saw her yesterday for a consult for some filler and she was very honest and told me that she didn't think I needed it at this time, and she advised me to wait. I appreciate her honesty and trust her implicitly! I also had a consult with Dr. Zarrabi for his thoughts on a cool-sculpting procedure. He too was very up front and honest and gave me some other options if I choose to move forward.
They both made me feel comfortable and I will continue to see them. The ladies in the office are always welcoming and very professional.

I love Dr. Zarrabi. He has the best manner, he doesn't push anything on you but he finds the least intrusive and also least expensive way to be of help.

He's got a personality you don't often find in doctors. Gentle and kindly but also wise.< /review>

I was referred to Dr. Zarrabi by a co-worker who raved about him. I went in to have something removed from my face and I was extremely concerned about how it would look. He explained his process in detail, answering all of my questions/concerns and gave me options.  He was extremely professional and I knew I was in good hands.  I'm very happy with the outcome and would highly recommend him!< /Review>

Dr. Zarrabi really takes the time to talk with his patients and understand his patient’s anxiety. He makes sure you really understand what to expect at all stages of the process and is a true artist in delivering outstanding results. While I am only a few weeks out from my cosmetic surgery, I think I look amazing and can't wait to see the final results in a few weeks. Choosing Dr. Zarrabi as my plastic surgeon was definitely the right choice for me.<//review>

From the moment I walked into Dr.Zarrabi’s serene office, I felt welcomed and relaxed. I was greeted by two friendly and attentive ladies at the front desk. There was a bit of a misunderstanding regarding my appointment, and without skipping a beat, it was taken care of.
Upon first meeting Dr.Zarrabi, I was impressed with his thorough knowledge of my concern, and his ability to explain the procedure. He did not talk over my head or use “Dr.talk”  Dr.Zarrabi has a wonderful demeanor and I felt I could ask any and all questions on my mind. I look forward to being a patient at this amazing office .< /text>

<review>Dr. Zarrabi is not only a fantastic person he is an extraordinary surgeon who not only knows plastic surgery but also worked in the ER and knows how to patch you up, or make you look better.   After taking the time to listen to what you want to fix or change about yourself he consults with you and follows up in a very professional and caring manner.   My wife and I are both proud to say we are former patients of Dr. Michael Zarrabi.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Dr. Zarrabi really helped me through an emergency situation. I am a dentist and I was performing an oral surgery when I sliced my finger with a blade. Dr. Zarrabi saw me right away and stitched up the cut perfectly. I was able to go back to work the next day and my finger has healed perfectly since. Thank you Dr. Zarrabi for saving my finger! You're the best!< /review>

I have been very impressed by the sensitive eye to the care of my aging face that the office of Dr. Zarrabi, and Sherry Sanvictores perform with various remedies, from micro needling, to injections.  Sherry Sanvictores is brilliant!< /review>

<gmapID>0x80c2bb29ec4919fb:0xb00f5c72aa066bd4< /gmapID><pics>None</pics><review>It was the middle of the day, middle of the week, during the chaos that leads up to christmas. I slipped on a rock in the tide pools with my hands in my pocket and fell face first onto another rock. I chipped two teeth and split my entire lip open from front to my gum line, split through and through, it was a mess. I was a mess, and thought I would never look the same again. I'd never met Dr. Zarrabi before but he took me in, as an emergency visit, calmed me down, helped me feel safe and assured me that everything was going to be ok. I'd heal up and be good as new. I really appreciated his gentle manner and holistic approach to the body. The surgery room had a friendly feel, they even let me pick the music, yes there was music in the surgery room. The assistances, office folk, and nurse were all so sweet and helpful in every way. It was a great place to be taken care of when i was going through a trauma. I can not recommend them more highly.< /review>< Rate>

<review>I was very unhappy with my stomach so I decided to do something about it. The minute I walked in Dr Zarrabi's office I felt nervous. But the staff was very nice and professional. They eased my nerves down. Dr Zarrabi was great. He explained everything in detail.  I left with alot of confidence that day. And after everything was done I loved him even more. I looked great. I couldnt believe I didn't do this sooner I had a breast reduction and a tummy tuck. He did a great job.<//review>< Pics>

< review>
The best best cosmetic surgeon in the whole world .. Most caring and knowledgeable Dr I found when I was looking for the dr who would help me "restore " my figure after two pregnancies . On a personal note , I am a hairstylist and want my clients to be nothing shy of absolutely happy with their new hair style I've created .. If My client decides they still need to add a few more highlights or cut a few more strands to make it just perfect I do what ever I can to ensure my clients happiness reguardless of any time or cost at my own expense because their satisfaction comes first in my book and I know that Dr. Zarabbi operates in the same manor I do with all of his clients .. He wants is all of us to be happy with the outcome of his work and will exceed expectations .. Truly a artist .. My confidence is back to wonderful and I get a million compliments on my new shape often ..God bless his heart because he deserves it.  I truly am so greatful I found such a sweet and down to earth gifted Doctor.<//review>

<review>Dr Zarrabi is the BEST!!! He is the sweetest, most caring doctor around! The thing I liked most about DR. Zarrabi is when I went in for my consultation he told me all the things I didn't want to hear first about breast implants and then he told me all the great things about it, it's important that people are informed with the Side effects of implants and what can happen. I did have a little road bump but its they way my body healed with my implant and Dr Zarrabi is there with me every step of the way and soo supportive and helpful. He is very very knowledge. My surgery went soo smooth and my recovery was amazing. His entire staff is awesome, they're all soo sweet and caring, I love that when you come in they know you by name and treat you more like family then just a patient. When I went for my fitting for my implants dr zarrabi, really took time with me to chose the right ones for my body size and the perfect size I wanted as well he was there every step of the way.  Going into surgery I was soo nervous but his staff took such good care of me I cant thank them enough. After surgery, I went home Dr Zarrabi himself took the time and called me personally to make sure I was doing okay! This place is amazing, I always high recommend Dr. Zarrabi.</review>< resp>

<Text>Besides being late...
He was polite on the phone,  but in person,  once he arrived,  he gave no greeting,  no apology for being late,  and didn't even acknowledge my presence; he just started opening my vehicle. It was very weird!
He was very off-putting and had an attitude or something.   I almost said something because he was making me upset, but I held back. I would not feel comfortable with that guy coming to help my wife.  He was just "off". Horrible experience!

If my insurance company ever says ASAP is coming to assist,  I will cancel the service and request someone else. I'm not happy.</Text>< Name>

I ordered a tow through my Insurance, they showed up and called me from a number with caller I’d Deborah LEE KPC at 2:19pm. I of course did not answer as that is not from the company. I looked out the window and the tow company was outside at 2:20pm I put on my shoes and was outside 2:22pm and tow truck drove off with seeing i was outside. I called the company and they said it was canceled now and there’s nothing they could do. For 3 MINUTES. I work for Geico so I called the company. Filed a complaint.  I advised them to NEVER assign me to this company again for my Mercedes and re consider not having a contract with this money as they have so many complaints

Called ASAP to file a complaint and I spoke to DANNY D. Who sounded half asleep and was super rude and said there’s nothing he can do and he did not care.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>So, the towing experience was ok, however,  I insisted to the tow driver i owed $60 because my insurance didn't cover the full mileage driven and he told me "no your fine." The next day I get a call from their business and I told the woman what occurred and she acted like I was trying to SCAM them and she threatened me with a voice-mail after the phone call and said "if you do not pay i will call the sdpd to take your car." Like excuse me?
Update: I called the company back, apparently,  the tow truck driver told them I didn't ask about payment or anything, when 3 times I asked him ARE YOU GOING TO COLLECT THE PAYMENT? ARE YOU SURE? all I remember is his first name is Al, and I will never use this service again if they think it's ok to allow the employees to lie.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Have been waiting for over 3 1/5 hours for the tow. Was told that my tow truck would be here at 9:50am it's now 1:30pm no truck. Now thanks I'm for being over 4 hours late my car could not be fixed today. If my insurance company ask me if I would use you again answer is a HELL NO!!!!! ASAP stands for (as slow as possible or as shity as possible)</text>

< Review>
My husband got hit by a driver that ran a stop sign. These people towed his car he went to the hospital .he left everything in his car. These people wouldn’t let him get anything out of the car unless he showed proof of insurance. He had all that in the car. Plus stuff was missing when he looked inside his car.. what kind of people go through accident victims cars when their in the hospital.  Can’t trust these people with your cars if it has stuff in it.<//Review>

< Review>
Tow was booked through my insurance provider, waited until ETA and had not heard anything so I called into tow company and was given some lame excuse about how the insurance company had called and cancelled the tow, and to ask them. Called insurance and they had no idea, were wondering why the tow wasn't there an hour later. Insurance called the Tow company and was given a completely different excuse about how they had called them and left a message, with no record of any messages. Unprofessional and offered no explanation or accountability. 0/5 star. would not recommend.<//Review>

<text>ASAP towing was contracted through my insurance company to tow my car to the shop. Bassam arrived 10 minutes early and had to think twice of how to load my car because of the way I was parked. He was very personable and extremely efficient at his work. The whole process took about an hour from my first phone call to my car being dropped off at the shop. Thank you ASAP towing and Bassam for the great job you did for me!< /text>< Pics>

<review>Walked outside one morning to find my car wouldn’t start, so I started a roadside claim with my insurance who dispatched ASAP Towing. The technician arrived in a timely manner, but did not display any sort of professional demeanor (little eye contact, short, annoyed); I felt like an inconvenience. He claimed my battery tested fine and simply needed to charge for a while once he jump-started it.
Fast forward one week, and my battery is once again dead. I start another claim, ASAP is dispatched once again, and coincidentally the same technician shows up. This time he claims the battery tests dead and needs to be replaced (one week later??). He offers a new battery for $205, I agree and he installs it. The kicker is, the car WON’T START with the new battery, minutes after he installs it. I express concern at this, and he brushes it off, stating the battery is fine and it’s probably because it sat in his van for 2 weeks. He states that if there are any further issues to contact the battery manufacturer directly (apparently this is ASAP company policy).
Fast forward another week, and the “new” battery is dead. I get a jump start from another towing company, bring it into my actual service dealer, and they determine the battery he installed has a bad cell.
I call ASAP Towing asking for a refund, and they absolutely refuse to help me.
This company is a sham. I paid for a battery that was clearly faulty from the start, and was never tested before installation, and they refuse to offer any sort of customer service or refund. I’d advise to stay away from them!

TLDR; - ASAP dealt with me in an unprofessional manner, installed a faulty battery in my car, and refused to refund me.< /review><rating>1< /rating>< time>

<review>Confirmed my number several times with the woman who fielded the call. She even repeated the right number back and tells me 45 minutes for a tech. Hour passes and nothing. Call them back after reading similar reviews of this happening to others. Get the same woman, who tells me the number I gave was wrong (she literally re-read the wrong number to me) and the tech tried to get in touch with me but gave up and went back. I told her we had confirmed my number, so why was it wrong? She insisted we didn’t (we did), and we went back and forth for a bit before I simply hung up out of frustration. To be fair, she offered to resend a tech, but why bother? I wouldn’t use this company. Steer clear.</review><Rating>1</Rating><gmap_id>0x80d959d042428133:0x2184afa52797405d< /gmap_id>< username>

<review>Had my broken down car towed from my home in Point Loma to my mechanic in PB. I called and pre-set a time for ASAP towing to get the car. "Sony" the tow technician was on time, and very friendly. He quickly got my car up on the tow and on it's way to my mechanic. I would highly recommend ASAP towing.<//review>< pics>

I went through my ins thinking it would be super simple for a flat tire change. Eta they said would be 45 mins. Hr came and no call. So I called the tow directly and they stated 10 more mins. 30 mins passed and still nothing. I contacted my ins and they contacted the tow and stated they had to get another driver enroute. No reason why and eta then said would be another 10 mins. When I disc with my ins, the tow guy called right after and adv it would be 20 mins not 10. 30 mins later he finally arrived. No apologies or anything. 2 hrs it took. If you ever go through your ins... I adv to not have them go through this Co.</Text>

Jack-ASAP Towing-Battery replacement Expert!

Betsy, my beloved Kia Soul, needed a new battery. I called my insurance company and they said somebody would be to me in about 45 minutes. Jack, from ASAP Towing, showed up sooner than expected and had Betsy's new battery, warranty included, installed in a heartbeat. He was professional, yet sociable and is so worthy of this review. Thanks Jack for a pleasant, at home battery replacement experience!<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Had ASAP Tow out to my home to take my vehicle to the dealership. The young man was clearly inexperienced as he could not lower his bed for my car. He was on his cell and finally got directions on how to extend and lower it. He chained up the front, which then started to rub against the spoiler. He unhooked the chain, and decided to drive the car up the bed, which wasn't positioned correctly. He would have definitely caused damage to the front end. Definitely will not use ASAP Tow again.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
I’m probably going to butcher his name but Wasam, was phenomenal. I called geico who quickly got ASAP towing up to date on my situation and they sent Wasam to me within 10 minutes. He was very gentle with my car as I was a total wreck and probably a super stressful customer. He held his professionalism and assured me everything would be okay. Only thing I would change would be the fact they should be able to get on naval/marine bases.< /Review>

First, he texted me to give me an estimated time of arrival. Then he called me 5mins early and met me on the corner exactly where I was at. What made me leave this review was his unshakable positive attitude and demeanor. I was already having a bad day, and then to lock my keys in my car topped it off. When it rains it pours. But! Nash’s positivity turned my day around. If ever I needed roadside assistance, I would rather go through Nash than Geico. He is a blessing to motorists in distress and it was an honor to make his acquaintance.

My car had a flat tire so I called the manufacturer road side assistance program and they dispatched ASAP Towing. It honestly took me longer to get through the roadside assistance phone call than it did for ASAP towing to come out, find my vehicle on a college campus, change my tire and get on with it. They were super professional and did it quick. I could tell the one gentlemen was training the other and even with the training it was quick. good experience and thankful.</review>

I've never used their service. I was backing out of my driveway and I was well into the street when one of these guys' tow trucks took a corner at 20 with a car being towed and didn't even slow for me backing out. Had I continued to back out maybe he would have stopped. I am parked right down the street from where this happened and I just saw him speed by towards the freeway. He was in a freaking *hurry*; that is so unsafe in residential neighborhoods.<//Review>

I was suppose to write this review awhile ago but here it is. So my car shut down on me and it said I was out of gas so I got someone from another towing company to  come, which took hours just to tell me they didn't have the truck needed to tow my car so I got ASAP towing. Ghaith Alkhafaji came jumped my car and charged my battery he was so sweet he was directing people out the parking lot while he was doing it for we were kind of blocking them in.  He gave some practical suggestions but I decided to take it to the dealer instead, by this time it was almost midnight.  He even messaged me after he dropped off the car off at the dealer which the other company said would not be possible because of the time. I was given peace of mind by this young man who was very knowledgeable and professional in every way. Thanks for employing such people like him. Thanks again Ghaith!< /review>

After rolling my car off the 67 highway ,CHP said they would take care of the car(getting it out of the ditch and such)and said they would be in touch took my number and info down then dropped me off a few miles from home,that was a fun day... well, they had the car towed to this impound lot. now, thankfully a good friend helped me locate my vehicle about 2-3 days after my car accident, as I was never contacted or notified of anything happening after the incident, but wait here's the crazy part. I immediately head down there ,as my good friend happens to be in the towing business and warned me they are charging for storage...I get down there and there and they gave me two options.
1)I sign my vehicle over to them and pay a fee of 400.00$ for the tow and storage
Or ;  2)pay 800.00$ for the fees and I can have my vehicle towed out of there,but not by them of course that would cost me my other leg(its great to keep a sense of humour in situations like these).
Amidst getting my car out[yes,I picked option 2;)] they tried to deny being able to take card and I had just about walked down to the trolley station for the ATM when my good friend steps up and notifies me that they are legally obligated to take card and I have come to realize that I was just minutes away from it being considered another day of storage which would have tacked a extra 200$ to my already outrageous bill. I still can't believe it, they were stalling me to scam 200 bucks off me ,don't let it happen to you most aren't as lucky as I was having that great friend to help.</review>

Not only did they charge us $165 more than they should have. They lied to us and then turned it around and said WE were lying to THEM.

ASAP towing would not release our car to us when we came to pick it up on a Friday because we didn't have the registration in our hand. Well, we had the registration but it was in the car. We weren't allowed to see our car because we didn't have the registration. See the catch there? The guy at the lot said he checked the car but couldn't find it. This made us have to go to the DMV to get a new registration on Friday at 4:30pm.

Come Monday, my husband paid $850 to release the car to us. He opened the driver door and found his registration there on the passenger side floor. So we were frustrated.. We could have gotten our car on Friday had the guy actually looked. Not only that, they LIED and said they didn't make any mistakes, the registration wasn't in the car, and we had to pay the extra $165 to keep our car in their lot over the weekend.

I called the main office and they did not believe that we were telling the truth. They believe the registration wasn't in the car and that we kept it in the lot over the weekend because we wanted to lose the money. We spoke with Bakr Aldulaimi at the lot (the guy who "couldn't find" our registration) and we talked to the manager over the phone. We were told to call and talk to Richard Pine. Well he is conveniently out of the office every time we try to call. I'm not sure he exists..

Every dealing we've had with this company, in person, and over the phone, the people have been rude and treated us like we were smaller than them. Very unprofessional. Illegal. Dumb.

Please do not use this company - they will try to cheat you and they will most likely get away with it too.<//Review>< GmapID>

Been waiting 3 hours and a half and I'm still stuck on the side of the freeway. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this company. Garbage customer service. If my insurance wasn't picking up the tab I'm sure they would have been here 3 hours ago. Shouldn't even get 1 star......</review>

There is a reason this company is only a 2. 7 out of 5.
the person in charge at this company has created a culture of very poor customer service.  I recommend NEVER using this company.

Please look at my profile and you'll see that I usually always give 5 Star reviews.   ASAP Towing was sent out to handle my roadside assistance for my Nissan Sentra, which had a low battery.

This company is a scam.

The Battery tech arrive 15 minutes late, crosswired the charging device on my battery, causing my battery to have a major spark.  After that the battery was completely dead.  Then he tries to sell me on one of their new batteries right away.

Have you heard of this the scam before?

This could have all been resolved by their manager and they still have every opportunity to contact me to resolve this, yet I'm confident that they won't.

The dispatcher lied to me and said he was sending a second check out and he would arrive within 10 minutes.  Thirty minutes later, the second tech had still not arrived, and I had to get a ride home because I had to work the next morning.

The first tech went back to his office and lied about arcing my battery.<//Review>

<text>Showed up 3 1/2 hours early to tow my car, the tow truck driver told my roommate that he was early because the insurance adjuster was at the collision center and was expecting my car... I was not home at the time so when I did get home I called the adjuster and he said that he was still planning on meeting me at my house, this caused me to have to re schedule with my insurance adjuster and borrow a car to drive to the collision center and gather my personal belongings because I was not home when they took my car I did not have the chance to gather my things out of the car...this then rolled over into me having to re schedule my pick up with the rental car center and arrange for a ride to pick up my car because of the adjusted time they could no longer offer puck up service...when talking to ASAP Towing they could pretty much give a S#*T and never apologized.... DO NOT EVER LET THEM TOW your car<//text>< pictures>

<review>If I could give this subhuman garbage zero stars and a night in jail, I would. License number 47912A2 decided that he didn't want to wait any longer in the busy left turn lane he was in. Our turn lane was clear so with about two feet of clearance he pushed himself in front of us, forcing our driver to stand on the brakes (thankfully no one was right behind us or we would've been rear ended) and come to a screeching halt to avoid a wreck. He promptly took our turn and made us miss our light, to add insult to nearly creaming us. TRASH. AVOID.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1597248464890, 'text': 'Dear Customer - This is not up to our company standards and we will be investigating the issue with our driver.

This tow company is a joke and a waist of time. We Waited over 2 hours. Kept calling and they wanted to prentend that they weren’t just talking to us. Asked to speak to manager/supervisor kept putting us on hold and stayed on hold for a fat minute. Kept telling us he would be here in 10 minutes. Wouldn’t give use the tow truck driver phone number and kept saying they would have the tow truck driver call us. Never got a call from the tow truck driver.  Called again. The girl stayed on the phone to see if he would call but put me on hold, so we hung up. Then they stopped answering our phone calls after they were told we were getting irritated waiting for so long. So when the driver finally decided to call to say he was “10 minutes away”, we called them back and canceled their service. The tow truck driver still came and we told him we waited to long and canceled him. Sorry not sorry.<//review>

Terrible Service would not recommend using this company at all based on my experience. They scheduled the time and then kept delaying it for hours and at the end had the nerve to try and charge a cancellation fee.
Edit
This place is so bad that it took them over a year to add their canned response to my review. Yes they’re really going to investigate it one year later with the driver.<//text>

Pretty much the worst ever.  I am an insurance agent located in east county San Diego.  Had my car jumped by them and the offered to sell me a battery.  Since it was an interstate battery, I decided to buy it.  But, they sold me the wrong size battery.  Then they would not replace it or fix it.  I was willing to pay the difference of increase if there was one.  They actually told me to call interstate.  They were the ones that sold me the wrong size battery.  Moe, the supervisor, was callus and rude, and would not give me to his direct report.  Steer Clear!<//review>

I was very disappointed with the service of ASAP.  Just after 12 noon, I scheduled an appointment for them to come out to my job to give me a jump at 5:30 pm. At 5:40 pm. I called to get an ETA; the operator stated they were stuck in traffic nearby.  At 5:55, I called again. When they still had not arrived, I called again at 6:15 pm.  This time I asked to speak to a Manager; Moe came on the line; I asked him why the driver or the operator didn't just send another driver so that I didn't have to be stranded for such a long period of time especially since I made an appointment.  He agreed, and said he would send me a gift card for the inconvenience. I ended up cancelling the appointment since my husband (who was driving from La Jolla) arrived at 6:30.  I am also sending this complaint to Geico so that they never dispatch an ASAP driver to me again. After reading all of the reviews, it is clear there is no consistency with providing good customer service.  It's a shame that they do not care enough to improve or to provide better customer service training for their employees.  P.S.  I never received the gift card either.</text>

I wasn't using ASAP towing services, but one of their drivers in a compact car was driving in an unsafe manner. This occurred around 6am Nov 5th, 2018 around the 32nd Street Naval Base. He cut off several cars on the 15-S by driving down the emergency lane to merge ahead of other cars in motion, then cut off about 15 cars waiting to turn onto 32nd street so he could try to get to his destination faster. Bad representation of ASAP towing, especially to San Diego military personnel.< /Text>

They dont pay taxes correctly.
And they're Chaldeans and the owners of these places like liquor stores and gestations they force their own people to work under the  minimum wage i think they should get on the right track.<//text>

SHOULD BE ZERO STARS.
I didn't have my wallet or any means of funds on me but realized once I got to work that I ran out of gas. I used Honda Roadside Assistance (which was great) but they contacted ASAP towing to bring me gas. Being as I'm at work, I left my gas door open and asked that they fill it while I was working. I got several calls from the guy who came out and when I answered, he said he was at my car. I said, "Great. Gas door is open."  His response? "Are you not able to come down?" "No." "Well... I need you to come down to pay." "What do you mean? I'm covered by Honda. "I show no coverage here. I need you to come down to pay." I said I couldn't so he put me on hold while he called his company only to come on the line to inform me, BIG SURPRISE, I was covered. He asked if I could come out and sign and just like I told him before, It would be a while before I could come down. "We're good then." He said as he disconnected. WELL GUESS WHAT. He did not put ANY gas in my car at all. After a FRUSTRATING 40 minute call on the phone with some female representative advising me she couldn't do anything (you're in customer service and just doing your job. Get a new job sweetheart, they are probably treating you badly there.) I asked to speak with a supervisor who obviously didn't want to talk to me and once he finally agreed, I was accused of being a liar. No, not directly. But the response? "Oh Frank? He's been my employee for SIX YEARS. He would never lie about putting gas in your car. You just need to drive it and you'll get to a gas station." Well... I have a 2015 honda civic that shows you right away if gas was put in. I HAVE ZERO MILES available. I can't get out of my work parking lot with reassurance that there's enough gas to get to the station. Their response? Drive on it. If I get in an accident, it's not their fault cause Frank DEFINITELY put gas in. They refused to send someone else out unless my insurance paid for it (which of course, I can only request once a week so they weren't able to help.) I explained that I would be leaving a review about this unfortunate encounter with their company and his response? "Go ahead. Anything else I can do for you Ma'am?" I didn't catch the name of the "supervisor" but when I asked what they were going to do to assist me, he told me to have a great day and ended the call.
Honda was on the phone with me the entire time and was absolutely appauled. I also work in customer service and was disgusted by how I was spoken to. Their hold recording reassures you that you can count on them and they are the best in san diego. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I'd rather swallow the gasoline they DIDNT put in my car then ever have to deal with them again. Thus begins my journey to post this review on every site possible.< /Review>

The driver showed up a hour early for appt time, then called and demanded I come out to the street now. He kept arguing with. I followed driver and on several occasions he almost got the car hit. Worst company ever. Calling the company doesn't help either they defend there drivers with bad attitude and driving.< /text>

Absolutely the worst towing company in California. I've waited two hours before I finally got my service. I wish I could give it no stars. Please never use this service. Do yourself a favor and save time.<//Review>

SAVE YOURSELF! PLEASE USE ANOTHER SERVICE. Had to give a star to review. Supposed to be local. Tow yard 2 1/2 miles from breakdown. Called for a tow told 45 minutes or less.  One hour later get a call from the driver he will be another 45 minutes he's in Chula Vista towing another vehicle. Call the office back we can't cancel it's $35 charge and said thier driver is really only 15 minutes away. Then driver called us back a second time and said he's rolling as fast as he can and is still unloading the car in Chula Vista. Spoke with dispatch again they lied and told us another 15 minutes because they changed drivers and got us one that was closer. Needless to say the driver did not get there for another 45 minutes, from CHULA VISTA, just like he told us. So total 1 HOUR 45 MIN from original call BEFORE driver showed up. I dont care where you are in San Diego that is enough time to get to El Cajon.
I work dispatch and if we cant get a tech there in a reasonable time, we offer the client that they may call another company who can assist them promptly. Not charge a cancelllation fee.
I have never done a review until now but after the headache and run around and literally calling them out on lying, we were given a $10 discount. Not worth it!</Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Well stocked store near the lake. We bought some fresh produce and steaks. The only disappointment was that we paid $17/lb for thick steaks. When we asked them to cut them in half, butterfly style, the lady said to me, "Cant you just do it at home?" She then explained the butcher was gone and the one other man in the store who knows how to slice meat in half was too busy to help us. Although their customer service is lacking I will definitely go back. Everything we bought there was really good - especially yhe steaks!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXGqoJphE_AV3S3GSrokh_i6cmZ-i7QENT4OBi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

Good little market to get some of the items you  forgot to get at the supermarket for your vacation at Lake Almanor; Creamer, Fresh produce, batteries.. They have a good beer selection,  an AMAZING wine and liquor collection and what looks to be a great deli. Of course you pay double what you do in your bigger stores, but we all know that going in.. since the convenience is great, the selection of items is adequate and the people are nice.  Try the fresh made cookies at the register counter... BOMB!!<//Text>

Note to owners: you can wear masks (properly) like the rest of us, you just refuse to.  Otherwise I seriously love this shop for quick quality food supplies :)<//review>

Great place to stop at. All of the staff is friendly. They have a small fresh meat counter as well as a selection of super yummy fresh produce. And their deli, well it serves some of the best subs around. They also have a large selection of hard alcohol, wine and a smaller section of locally brewed beer. The only down side is that some of their prices are high.< /text>

< Review>
Stopped there after driving through the area from Hamilton Branch. Wife and I had deli sandwiches, bought roughly $50bucks worth of deli, grocery, and snack foods. The owner was very nice, we talked fire a bit (I'm a retired assistant fire chief, started a little rough at first, the lady waiting on us in the deli originally was a little rough, could be due to being extremely busy.........but seemed to change demeanor when the owner came through......wife ordered a sandwich and we found out that nearly half of what she ordered was left off??  Had I known we would have asked but she told me when we were home some 40 plus miles away. Overall it's a great find. We will probably go back at some point before the snow flakes fly. Thanks Wally you were a class act. And wife thanks you for the hollyhock starts...Mac and Wife.</Review>

<Text>Great prepared food (World's best potato salad), excellent sandwiches, soups and all the traditional grocery store items. Impressive meat case and a wide variety of wine and liquor too. Friendly service brings it all together.  Don't miss Wally's Beanz for a cup of coffee or a milkshake just the way you like it.</Text>< rate>

This is the best store within 25 miles of Lake Almanor Country Club. They also have the best meats in the area. I highly recommend the Spencer steaks and they have a superior supply of wines and liquors.</Text>

Do not buy from this dude. He will just keep you waiting and waiting whenever you order delivery from him (even if you’re down the street from his shop) he’s rude as hell, he gives you the same strains over and over again when you order from him, and the prices keep changing everytime i order a quarter from him. Do not buy or order weed from this sketchy shop!!!<//review>

<Review>First time. Sprinter broke down on a delivery so I had to crash 2 nights. Unfortunately the first day I stopped at one of the illegally run shops. ONLY DELIVERIES ARE LEGAL IN KERN COUNTY. thankfully the second day I was blessed to find budville delivery. My platinum and rosay was top shelf indoor. OG even threw in a free 2 gram blunt of his fav strain. Also stoner points for showing in less then 15 minutes.< /Review>< Rating>

Not your average storefront but hey it is what it is. I bought an eighth of "Super Jack" and an eight of "Watermelon Zkittlez" stars for quality, friendliness, knowledge and location. Thanks again.

I'm not a big fan of Mexican food but the design drew me to give this a try. Got to say, I was pleasantly surprised. We had carne asada, ceviche, and grilled octopus plate. All the dishes were great. You can see they are still figuring things out, but I'm sure in a few months it will be even better.</Text>

<Review>his was the worst "mariscos" place I have ever been to. Geezuz. Smh. I read the reviews and thought it would be good but we were SO mistaken. We walk in and the place is dead, not one customer. Didn't think much, it's a Tuesday night so maybe it's slow. We were visiting from out of town and figured we just caught it on a slow day.  Ok so we get in and order. After ordering I go use the restroom and wash my hands. The toilet seat was COVERED in urine. EVERYWHERE! So I wipe most of it off with  paper towels,enough to where it won't soak through seat covers. Gross. You would think if they are dead that the place would be spotless (because what else do they have to do,right?) but the server/cashier was on his phone when we walked in. Ok whatever so I get to the table and my drink is there along with some chips and salsa. I go to wipe down the high chair since it's flu season and I'm putting my baby in it (I carry Clorox wipes). Yeah the wipes were dark with dirt from the chairs,again gross. I sit down and go to grab my horchata and the cup has orange lipstick still on the part you put your mouth...I'm guessing from the last person that drank out of It. They gave us no straws. So I ask the server for a clean cup without lipstick . He apologized. Brought me a new cup and drink. We had ordered a langostinos appetizer, the green ceviche, and a mixed coctel. My husband gets his ceviche and it's a small plate,not even enough for 1 person to get full and the server had said it was enough for two. Looked like a snack,not a main dish as shown on the menu. It lacked flavor. The langostinos are served in their "house sauce", again no flavor at all. We asked for them be spicy and got cheesy flavored ones served to us instead. Gross. No flavor but if I could describe them,it would be like cheese. Not a mariscos taste. Another disappointment. We got like 6 langostinos for around 17 bucks. The ceviche was pricey too and very small. Then for my coctel...I ask for it room temp, not hot and not cold. (Usually any place you get mariscos, they have the option of hot,room temp or cold). It comes and it's smoking hot,smh. Let me start by saying that they charge about 18 bucks for coctel made up of 5 shrimp, a few tiny pieces of octopus and the rest was some weird orange water. Barely any onion tomato or avocado. I have never had a coctel where the water was like orange water, not like the usual tomato color. It was weird. Had ZEROOOO flavor. Zero. Think of hot water with 5 shrimp. Yup. I had to get up and ask for ketchup,lime and salt because NONE of them were brought to the table. This is supposed to be a mariscos restaurant and lime/salt are key in eating this type of seafood. Why not bring that with the food. When I walk to the server (on his phone) and asked for the salt he asks me in return if I want salt and again I say yes,salt and lime. Also my husband asked if tostadas came with his ceviche since none were brought either. I have to say that I added,salt,lime,tapatio,ketchup and another hot sauce they had there...still no flavor.  Very hard to flavor that much water. I ate the shrimp,tiny pieces if octopus and left the water. I will NEVER go back there again. The whole place needs help and they need to seriously get someone in the kitchen that knows about flavor and cooking. My god. It was horrible. We would have left if it were not for the fact that we had already settled our baby in and started feeding before our long two hour trip. Left feeling grossed out, hungry and now about 30 minutes later I have a stomach ache. Save your money people. Don't go here.Barf.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Last night I was walking around and a guy ask me for food, I walk in to buy some food for the guy and the guy who was on the counter said; "I can't have a stinky guy on my restaurant." .... I said I just going to buy some tacos for the homeless guy and he insisted he can't stay on my place. That's was very unpleasant for me.
I THINK IT'S A MANY DIFFERENTS WAYS TO DEAL WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE.
AND THAT WASN'T GOOD

Last night I was walking around and a guy asked me for some food to enter this place and the guy who is attending said; I can't serve a stinky guy in my restaurant. He insists that he would only buy some food for the homeless and we would go out. And he said that was very unpleasant for his restaurant.
I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENTS WAYS TO DEAL WITH THE INDIGENT AND THIS WAS NOT A GOOD WAY.

Anoche caminaba por ahi y un tipo me pido algode comida entre a este lugar y el tipo que esta atendiendo dijo;  no puedo atender un tipo apestoso en mi restaurant. Insiste que solo compraria algo de comida para el indigente y saldriamos. Y el dijo que eso era muy desagradable para su restaurant.
CREO QUE HAY DIFFERENTS MANERAS DE TRATAR CON LOS INDIGENTES Y ESTA NO FUE UNA BUENA MANERA.<//Review><gmapID>0x808580952606a653:0x5aa67a1770614855<//gmapID><resp>None</resp>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Definitely bad service, not even a offered something else? When I wanted to ask for something, Miss had already turned around ... I don't know, but it was weird that they didn't provide me with cutlery! About the food, I really expected a little more, but well that's why only one star ... I'm leaving something deprecated!

(Original)
Servicio defnitivamente malo, ni si quiera un se les ofreze algo mas? Cuando quise pedir algo ala señorita ya se habia dado la media vuelta... no se, pero fue raro que no me brindaron cubiertos! Sobre la comida, la verdad esperaba un poco mas, pero bueno por eso solo una estrella... me voy algo desepcionada!!<//review>

<Review>Superb!!

We were in town visiting and wanted noodles. This restaurant was spot on. First started when ordering, beer machine wasn’t cooperating but cashier took the time to change it out to give a perfect beer instead of just giving me whatever came out. 3 stars just for that. We had vegan noodles and spicy bbq pork noodles just to try a variety. Both were spectacular. Wonderful patio safe Covid protocols... perfect. We will be back for sure!!</Review></record>

I enjoy to frequent this place. The staff are nice and the food is on point as advertised. Unfortunately the only time I took a photo of my order was during the pandemic and it doesn't do it justice of a normal present pre-pandemic. Though the savory flavor of the Birria Noodz are worth it.<//review>

<text>Amazing fried rice!! We got it with shrimp as well and they didn’t skimp on it. We had to buy another serving to take home. We went on St. Patrick’s and they had this special drink that was delicious too! We were able to sit inside and the staff was so kind and attentive. Prices are good value. Got pretty busy, you can tell they’re a David favorite (:< /text>< Pictures>

Great drinks. The only reason I’m giving this a 4 star is because some food items are a bit bland in flavor. The majority are good though</Text>

This place is easily in my top 5 favorite restaurants in Davis. Their dumplings, thai wings, thai tea, and cocktails are just THE BEST. Red 88 is great for lunch, dinner, and late night snacks and booze. I miss this place every day.< /Review>

Best fried rice within 50 miles! Ever since Benihana in Sacramento closed down I hit the causeway to Davis  for the Red88 fried rice. It’s mouthwatering and will keep you coming back for more.</text>

<Review>the chicken udon noodles did not disappoint it has such a nice spice to it as well as the platter with the chicken fries and potstickers. felt as if we were drunk in our early teens despite the pandemic. we cried. we laughed. we even requested it to be made with love but i think it was made with euphoria. we fell in love again and again and over and over timelessly.

<review>Okay, every time we order food from here, be it in house or to go, it’s delicious, and we’ve never had a problem. However, the to go drinks are veeeery weak. My boyfriend ordered the margarita slushy pitcher, and he’s a big guy with a high tolerance, so of course it’s not going to do a whole lot, but I couldn’t even taste the tequila when I sipped it. Tonight I got a Rocket Pop and the taste was great, but I barely got buzzed. It was a pretty big drink and I’m about 123 lbs. It was about $30 for our 2 drinks tonight, please make it worth it!!<//review>< Pics>

I'm posting this in hopes that their food and service has changed since I went there my first and last time about 8 years ago.. so not sure if those two have changed, I hope they have.
My experience was not good at all. I went there late at night to order food and try their Thai tea.
The guy who took my order was rude and didn't want to be bothered with me even though there was only two other people in there at the time.
When I received the food, I wasn't too thrilled with it after two bites I decided to have it taken to go.
The Thai tea seemed like it was more regular than the normal Thai tea I've had through the years.
After I left and took the rest of my food to go, I put it in the fridge and thought I'd try it the next day and maybe I was just not as hungry and it may be better the next day. That night I felt pretty sick but thought I may just be catching something. I wasn't up to eating anything the next day so I let my teenage son have it as he wanted to try it. He got violently sick after he ate it!
Anyway, am making another review on here since I don't see my original view on here so was just hoping it has changed owners, food quality, etc after 8 years.<//review>

Its own talking point: bottomless thai iced tea! Super clean floors/tables and friendly/quick service. Amazing little chili sampler they bring out to the table with your food and all utensils already in the tin on the table. Family friendly but also chill enough to come with friends. Definitely coming back again!< /review>< user_id>

Always friendly and prompt service. The food is creative and delicious Asian fusion. From the Spicy Beer Soup to the Asian Fusion Fries it is a "Go-to" place on chilly California nights.

We even had a private party here once. Everything went smoothly and everyone was impressed with the food.<//Text>

<Text>Delicious food and decent prices. It is a bar/pub setting, so don't come looking for a quiet night out, but it's definitely a good place to have a few drinks and enjoy a variety of foods.

Friendly staff and good service.

I had the duck soup, which was rich and delicious, and quite filling. I also highly recommend the Drunken Pig Fries (curly fries are clearly superior).</Text><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>102104544868229507214</UserId.></record>

<text>Have you ever had a beer tower before? If not, get a group of friends and order one. It's a fun experience to not need to order the individual drinks and it's an accomplishment to finish it off and it's honestly priced quite well. The crab cream cheese wantons are amazing and highly recommended.

As for drinks, the Hot Lips and the FML are tasty.

I've never ordered anything bad at Red 88.</text>< pics>

First time I went to red 88 and it was amazing. The atmosphere is lowkey while also being uplifting. It is a college go to for their 2 for $10 Tuesdays. The food was great, the fried rice is to die for. Moreover, their mixdrinks all taste good. Highly recommend.</Review>

DO NOT EVER EAT HERE.
Placed an order over the phone at 4:30 they said it would be ready in ten minutes. It’s 5:26 and have still not received food.
Some guy accidentally got my order and they just handed me the food he took home. Who knows if this guy ate some of it or if he did something to it. You cannot give someone food if it’s already been given to someone else. They LIED saying they gave new food but watched them and they gave us the same exact food.
They are also refusing to give any sort of discount to the food for the extreme wait and lie on the wait of time. And for the disgusting fact that they gave someone else our food and didn’t want to replace that.
Horrible.</review>

Red 88 is a good place for some good Thai food, the atmosphere is nice and cozy. The service could be better, more prompt, but the waiters are always nice and attentive. The prices are good and the selection of dishes is good too. The food is tasty although it could be less greasy, that's my only complaint. The appetizers are delicious. Even though this is not my favorite Thai food restaurant it is still a good restaurant nevertheless. Check it out if you haven't. It's definitely a thumbs up!< /Review>

Probably one of the most consistently good restaurants I’ve gone to. The staff is friendly and professional, and their food is freakin’ BOMB. I could eat their fried rice everyday. Also, the bottomless Thai Tea is definitely a huge positive. Great fusion of Thai food with others.<//Review>

Good food. They have inexpensive dumplings that were quite delicious. The lighting is very dark when it isnt a bar.</Review>

<Text>I have been very disappointed with my last few visits in this location. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants for years. I would come 3-4 times a week. Last time I came in I was informed that the special I received through email for the special Monday red 88 deal was for dine in only. No where does it state that in the email and I didn’t find out until I drove all the way over there. Then you have changed your stamp card process several times from the cards to the phone number to a credit card now. What if I don’t pay with that credit card every time I come to the restaurant. The waitress didn’t seem to care about any of my concerns and brushed it off as no big deal and it’s not my problem. I haven’t been back since.< /Text>< Pictures>

One of my favorite bars in Davis. Fmls will be in 90% of people's hand's on busy nights. And for good reason; very tasty but strong fruity drinks. It's honestly hard for even me to skip and I usually stick to whiskey<//text>

Delicious!  Red88 combines vast bowls of delicious soup with excellent service.  A noodle bar is truly an undergrads best friend and Red88 brings it all together with good food, good wireless and good drinks.  Try the Thai Iced Tea!<//review>

Not very good (these trendy pan-asian places usually aren't).  I ordered a Thai bbq-pork dish, which was literally some chewy pork, white rice, and a dish of sweet chili sauce (the kind you buy at the store) -that's it.  Jenky.  My friend had the shrimp wonton soup, she wasn't very happy with it, and in the end only located 1 shrimp in the whole thing.  There are a lot of good restaurants in the area, so I guess that's why this place was nearly empty on a busy lunch hour.  We also passed on the "frequent diner" punch card, not coming back here.</review>

I contacted several window cleaners through Google Maps for quotes. Lookout Window Cleaners was the only vendor to respond. They responded within in the hour! They cleaned every window on every floor, both inside and out, and cleaned the tracks! They also cleaned the back-yard glass fence and did an amazing job.

Fast response, great quality, friendly. Would definitely let them into my home again! Highly recommend!

Ask for Aaron Jackson!<//Text>

They were able to quickly get us on the schedule last minute. Very accommodating to our busy schedule. The windows look great! I highly recommend them to others! We have several neighbors on our street that have made appointments and are  very happy with their work. We will be using them again!< /text>

Aaron and his team were fantastic to work with and did an incredibly thorough job. He was timely, very communicative throughout the entire process, his pricing was reasonable and he was very flexible and timely with when he scheduled to get the job done. We will definitely be continuing to use Lookout Window Cleaners for all of our future window cleanings!<//Text>

I’ve never called to get windows cleaned so I wasn’t confident the experience I was going to get but Aaron not only made room in his schedule to help us he was incredibly friendly and did a great job for a good price. I highly recommend giving him a call for window cleaning help.< /text>

Clearly you won't find more immaculate windows from anyone in the San Diego area. I'm talking crystal clear.

And who the hell ever cleans their own skylights-- honestly!? We think about it. We talk about it, but do we ever actually schlep ourselves up there?

No, we do not.

The views now are so crisp, and the sunlight flowing so freely, it almost feels as if my house itself has put on a pair of Maui Jim sunglasses.

And at night, I can actually see the stars again. Maybe even a UFO, or two. Lookout, San Diego!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

OMG 😃 They did an amazing job cleaning my filthy windows and mirrors, as well as my glass shower doors. Super polite, efficient and really fabulous work. I didn't have to ask them to take off their shoes... they had already done it. They put up with my dog trying to give them kisses. They were on time and super professional. I highly recommend them and will be using them again! Fair price and nice guys.</Text>

<user_name>Audrey Cooper< /user_name><Date>1516746005503< /Date><rating>5<//rating><text>I went on to yelp and saw Aaron / Lookout Window Cleaners had some good reviews so I sent a quote out to 4 different companies at the same time.  Aaron was one of the first to respond.  His quote via Yelp was in the middle of the road price wise, he explained what exactly they do when they come out.  I did get a much lower quote but I was afraid that it was too low and from my experience with window cleaning you do typically get what you pay for, and I don't just want any random Joe Shmoe in my house!</text>< pictures>

<Text>I have very big windows in my living room. It is hard for me to clean myself. I would have to use a ladder to fully clean them. It was a hassle to try to do it myself so I did some research to see who could help me. I came across Aaron at Lookout Window Cleaners. He was very quick to respond to me and the pricing was reasonable.  He is very detailed in his work. It was left completely spotless after he was done. I don't think my windows were this clean when I moved into this place. I am truly grateful that I found him. It was so worth it. They will take care of you, guaranteed!< /Text>< Response>

<text>Look Out Window Cleaners raises the bar to a whole new level of Perfection. Very easy to work with, reliable and Trust-worthy! When you have a few favorite service providers, only a couple come to mind that leaves a real lasting impression and Look Out Window Cleaners is on that list!! I used to do the Windows myself, but after I had them professionally cleaned, I will never go back. They make your Windows invisible, so be careful not to bump your nose! Keep up the Great Work Aaron and the Look Out Window Cleaner Team!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>These guys come out to my house and clean the windows every 3 months and our windows are clean all year round.  It works out better that way because its easy for them because the windows never get too bad so they don't charge us as much as if they were to do it once a year!< /Review><UserId.>116975622743437746446</UserId.>< user_name>

I've used Aaron several times now and they do an AMAZING job!  Thank you so much again for the great looking windows and hard work!  The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star review is because Aaron normally has a crew with him but this last time he had to do it by himself which took a tad bit longer than I was anticipating but of course the windows still looked amazing!<//review>

<Review>Best window cleaning company I’ve ever used!  Aaron is meticulous and thorough, most the window cleaning companies I’ve ever used are in and out as fast as they can be leaving puddles on my floor, tracks aren’t cleaned as well as they should be, sills and frames aren’t wiped down but Aaron and his crew make sure everything is done 100% proper!</Review>< Date>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Huge everything sprawled everywhere. Bring everyone to help carry it. Bring both cars and all the kids. You're gonna wish you had more room in your vehicles. It's impossible to fit your new dining room table along with your 8 handles of booze and your 60 pack of double roll toilet paper. Not to mention the 80 pack of egg rolls and the 120 pieces of coconut shrimp you grabbed from the frozen section. After adding the 12 pack of beach towels there's hardly room for the complete mechanics tool set of 400 pieces. Fortunately, you don't need room in your cart to carry out a full quart of frozen yogurt served in a super big gulp and large pizza from the food court. But I will say this. You know how when you go into Target intending to spend $10 on one thing but always come out with $100 worth of stuff? That, but Costco-sized. But who doesn't love Costco?<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>This is one of the better Costco’s. My complaint always with Costco is that they need signs for the aisles or some way of finding things easier. But I guess they want you to walk every aisle. I disappointed that their prepared food selection (pizza, açaí bowl, etc.) is still rather limited.

This Costco did recently open a gas station close by.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>I love Costco. Their return policies on non major items cannot be beat. They really take care of the members.
They have also just installed the self check out and that was user friendly and efficient. Hopefully that will not impact employee jobs.<//Text><rate>5</rate><date>1617323378582< /date>< GmapID>

Costco in Sand City does have more than one kind of the same product or a different flavor then the one in Salinas however Sand City they stopped carrying mozzarella cheese in brick form and for at least a couple weeks they were out of chicken thighs but yet the Salinas Costco had plenty of it I prefer the one in Sand City it's much easier to navigate that place also seems a little bit on the smaller side and it's quite irritating at the sleeping Costco the employees leave the big metal carts to pick up the cardboard right in the middle of the walkways either in the isles or outside of the aisles they're much larger than the ones in Sand City and Salinas they have you wait in one line first then go to the couch register that doesn't need to happen I can see when a cash register is available or if there's only one person in line right now</text>

They usually keep it well stocked. Parking can be a challenge but the store itself is pretty good. Seaside doesn't have 20 people handing out free samples which we HATE. Fresno does that and the isles get blocked up with people wanting free samples. Good selection of clothing too. We bought most of the furniture including the beds and televisions for our new home at this store.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>112990687392232498562</user_id></record>

I called about 15 minutes before they closed to order a large pepperoni pizza. They said they stop taking orders by phone but if I was in the warehouse they would take my order. I rushed to the location as it was not far away and went through self checkout; a costco employee helped me scan in my order. By the time I got through the line my order time on the receipt said 1 minute past closing time. After getting through the food court line I was told it would be about 10 minutes. After a few minutes of waiting I was called up and told they could not make my order. They tried to lie to they were out of dough, but after I complained to membership and told them the situation they said they had closed and were putting stuff away. I blame the management for this situation as they created this problem and I heard multiple people being turned away. This Costco has a few terrible employees that don't belong in customer service, but management seems just as clueless. Multiple rude entrance greeters and exit clerks make Walmart look awesome. Just seems like more of the same trend of awful customer relations driven primarily by numbers and statistics instead of any common sense.</Review>

Great store for bulk shopping and getting all the fun random deals. Only thing they could really improve on is the pizza 🍕. It tastes delicious, it just takes FOREVER to get a pizza :(<//Text>

Great prices and a huge selection. There’s always something new to see when you first walk into the store. The facility is well maintained and clean. The employees prioritize sanitation with separation between workers and patrons. The store can get a bit crowded and the parking lot is almost always full. The store could use an in store navigation app as some items may be difficult to find while just browsing isles.</text>

<time>1614054251481</time><review>It's actually 3 stars knocked off for the rudeness and lack of customer service at the entrance. If you see people trying to enter the exit to get to customer service, why don't you direct them to the small door entrance that you're now using. And maybe a sign or two. How can you enforce social distancing if you're not directing people where to go? Instead you just watched us struggle to get in and let us discover for ourselves that we were in the wrong area and that there was actually a line. And the customer service desk? Yeah they provide the bare minimum. This is the rudest Costco I've ever been to. And I've been to many all over America. Btw one star gained for the upcoming gas station! But management, get your act together or else corporate may need to pay a visit.<//review>< Rate>

Costco practically has everything but bulk size. You can even get appliances there. Food or wine practically any necessary items</text>

I like going here because buying in bulk saves me from leaving my house to often right now. The people working there are pleasant. It took about an hour to roam the isles and grab my items. I go a little later in the evening and there doesnt seem to be to many folks which is nice. Overall I'm glad I have a membership. Oh yea Richard at checkout was really cool to chat with too. 17 years of Costco service right there and it showed. Kudos.<//review>

Friendly staff. Not extremely crowded like other Costcos in the area. Tend to find items here more than the other stores.</review>

<text>Place is small and you are getting pushed by other costumers and you won't get as much time as you like to look around.
Just go to Salinas CA Costco is much better and bigger.<//text>< date>

This costco is different from my usual one in San leandro. Way more things that I like. Definitely not the same crowded lines too. Ended up walking out spending just under 1k grabbing gifts for the fam🤦‍♂️. But we got most of it all done👍< /Review>

Would’ve given them 5 stars, but they don’t disinfect the kiosks after you use them.
Yet, they don’t allow you to use the water vending machine because it’s “unsanitary.” 🤔</text>

One of my favorite Costcos to visit and is worth the drive. Friendly staff, never overly crowded (I usually go on the weekend right when it opens). The lines aren't crazy like San Jose Costcos.<//Text>

I like the variety of items to purchase.  The customer service needs some improvment.  It makes me wonder if they realize or care that there are other places to shop.  Probably not since there are so many people, that they will get their business anyway.  I just don't like driving farther to be able to shop here only to be treated in a rude way.  It's happened on a few trips now.<//Review>

Parking is always a problem due to no management of this issue 😡😠😒 people expect you to be nice while they try and run you over..

PEOPLE! Be nice to each other or don't be surprised if people the same way back..

Parking could be controlled and the whole family could be happy..

Also I would open a drive up/ pick up service  bay .Order online and never have to get out of the car...just to keep the lines moving...
Contact me for the details..<//text>

Costco. Items that are screened for quality. Hard to beat pricing on a variety of items. Generous return policy. My go-to for decent affordable pizza (at their food court, not the take and bake).
Bonus - offers unbeatable people watching.
Pro-tip - if possible, try and avoid on the weekends, unless you're intention is to exercise your patience with other people.< /Review>

<review>Sand City Costco is great. Clean and organized. Staff is friendly. Food court was kind of packed some people not adhering to the 6ft rule, but what can you do with that? Just people in general are inconsiderate. They don't mind other and they don't put carts back when the cart corral is literally behind their parking spot. But Costco had everything I needed today.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

To crowded, narrow entrance. They need to work with city or county to re-design parking entrance & lot. Entrance & exit could also be widened or moved.</Review>

Parking is always a problem due to no management of this issue 😡😠😒 people expect you to be nice while they try and run you over..

PEOPLE! Be nice to each other or don't be surprised if people the same way back..

Parking could be controlled and the whole family could be happy..

Also I would open a drive up/ pick up service  bay .Order online and never have to get out of the car...just to keep the lines moving...
Contact me for the details..</Text>

<text>Be honest with yourself, the main reason you go to Costco are the samples, the groceries are a secondary objective. The first time I went here I was shocked as a kind employee gave me half of a whole panini she just made with turkey and cheese. I spent like an hour there with the other samples, and I had a tasty and satisfying lunch, and I bought absolutely nothing! Also, another time, my girlfriend, after purchasing a slice of pizza, dropped it completely face down in the parking lot. It was absolutely hilarious, and the woman working at the food court heard my story and gave me a free piece to give to her. That's what we call in the business a heck yeah moment. 11/10 would drop my pizza again.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great service, well-organized, good selections; Great staff, helpful, nice, polite and responsible. Many Costco stores in the Bay Area are super crowded and it could effect the quality of service. The kind of  service you receive here is conssiatently the service you receive at a high end store.</review>

< Review>
Production line Pizza like a Subway but for pizza. It works. Surprisingly, that pizza was really good and flavorful. They are personal size pizzas. I asked my to be more crispy and they were able to accomplish that. the crust or thin and pre-made so it doesn't take too long to get your pizza. A lot of nice toppings. I'm very particular about my pizza but I enjoyed this even though is not the way I would normally have a pizza. I will go there again.<//Review>

I would’ve given this place a zero. Went in to cancel my membership and encountered the rudest staff member my the name of Mami(not sure if that’s right, since she wasn’t wearing a badge). I have never encountered a staff member as unprofessional and rude as she was, luckily the manager came over and finished handling the situation. She definitely doesn’t need to work in any form of customer relations job. I definitely would not recommend this location!< /Text>

Parking is terrible. Drivers are very rude.   Not as much inventory as Salinas or Gilroy. Yes, it is a smaller store, but they stop carrying popular items. There is no such thing as a bad Costco, some are just better than others!</Review>

<review>I tried to apply for a costco citi. visa card and I was told that I was not allowed  to apply because my costco card is from mexico she told me it doesn't come up in the system then asked if  i wanted to apply for a Costco  card after she already saw that I had a  card. I felt very discriminated against that is not the first time they have questioned my card because it says mexico on it.</review></record></dataset><record>

Love this Costco. It's usually not too crowded like other Costco's. The salesman at the entrance was nice too, he just gave us information about one of the Costco credit cards and the benefits of it, but he didn't pressure us at all. Great store to go to if you need a lot of things or even if you just need to run in real quick for a couple items.< /Review>

If you like to randomly encounter horribly rude and unprofessional staff, this place is for you! My favorite is the lady who often works at the door and scowls at me every time I enter. This one is very hit and miss when it comes to staff. Some are really polite and courteous and others are trolls.<//Text>

<text>Costco is my  store. You  have  to  buy in bulk  but  it's  worth  it . My advice  though  is if you  see  something  you  like  buy it right  away  it may  not  be  there  when  you  come  back. There  bakery is outstanding. I have  almost  never  been  disappointed  with  anything  I've  purchased  there.  Also  there return policy  is second  to  none.< /text>< Resp>

Going to Costco is not always my first choice of stores to go to. It's just that these stores can be so busy, crazy, crowded. I have been to quite a few locations. My folks live in the area, this is the location they go to.</Text>

Costco is the best one stop shop around. Only downfall is when items you've become dependent on are discontinued.  Positive outweighs the negative. Thank you Costco. Just waiting for your gas station. Yay</review>

< review>
I'm sorry I had to do this. This Costco although provides a half decent service, the delivery company that delivers appliances is the worst. I cancelled my order today that was set to be delivered today. Why, when I waited two weeks after ordering my water and dryer would I do that you ask? Because they called me to tell me they were in front of my house, three minutes later when I arrived, they were gone. I was told they only had a 15 minute which I was well within. When I called back the delivery company, the employee cut me off in mid sentence twice and said nothing to me when she got off of the call. Now I am going to seats in Salinas because they have the same washer and dryer, same price, and in stock. I'm taking it in my truck to install at home. Thanks for nothing except a waste of time. Never buying online from you again.</review>

Prices good to excellent . Staff is super helpful. Pharmacy really good. I will give them 5 stars when they give maps to find the merchandise...today I had to search for the "new" location for 2 items I buy every time I shop there.  Forced to ask 4 help.  I hate that.< /Review>

<username>Raymond Sienkiewicz<//username><Text>It's a Costco! Fairly good selection of most everything and one of the better food court menus, but I can't help but feel the selection of frozen goods is a little sparse compared to some other locations I've seen. Awesome wine and liquor selection. Try to go on the weekdays if you want fewer crowds and can do without samples.</Text>< UserId.>

Conveniently located close to Hwy 1, and other stores. Ample parking. Good service and variety of goods. Employees are going out of their way to help you find items, or even get something for you if you forgot something. Checkout is always quick and friendly. Never had a bad experience.<//text>

<review>On a mission to buy medication for my dog.  Made purchase without difficulty.  Part of the Costco experience is window shopping and making that impulse purchase.  And so it was with that really nice leather chair.  I have been lusting for one of these.  I identified my target item, only to realize there is no price tag displayed.  Now all Costco shoppers have come to identify the price from a paper tag displayed over the item.  None to be seen.  So I checked with member services.  I explained my question and this is what I was told.  "We only put price tags on the display item and then we scatter the rest around the warehouse". Huh?  Never encountered this process before.  Seems like a weird marketing scheme.  The customer has to go on a treasure hunt seeking the display item to find the price and then go on a quest to find the non-display item to load up and purchase.  A new concept in marketing.  Make the customer go into a shopping frenzy looking for that leather chair.  Glazed over eyes tongue hanging out in anticipation of riding this leather chariot to my living room.  I found the whole thing non-Costco and slightly anti-customer. It's kind of obstruction marketing. Is the idea that you will appreciate the chair more if you had to work for it.  I had a couple of dates like that in high school.  A little miffed I got a swirl yogurt.  I didn't have to chase it and the price was prominently displayed.  In the future my shopping mantra will be 'AMAZON'!< /review><Date>1516406781579</Date><response>None<//response>< username>

<text>Keep an eye out from Hwy 101 - easy to drive right by. This is a large Costco - well laid out, easy parking- and the only one for miles.
We stop here every year beforet he family reunion. Very "one stop shopping."< /text></record></dataset><record>

The tire shop here does top-notch work at some of the best prices. Cheaper than any of the major chains in town (which is important if just passing through). Tire installation includes road-hazard warranty and nitrogen fill, which the other guys charge extra for!< /Review>

<review>I never know what to rate big box places. It's a good Costco but it never blows my mind. Customer service is usually really great and I love occasionally getting a hotdog and soda. The store is kept neat considering the size and crowd.< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>I had such a HORRIBLE experience here recently. I come here for things I buy in bulk. It is like any other Costco, but it doesnt have a gas station and the staff are stricter than any other costco I have been to. I went to buy some alcohol and my friend (who isn't 21 yet) was with me after I picked her up from the beach. She didnt feel like waiting in the car with our other friends. They wouldnt sell me the alcohol because she was with me and wasn't 21.

It didnt make any sense to me. When I asked them what I should do, they told me to "come alone next time". What really irked me was that instead of just telling me this from the start, the cashier still scanned my Costco card and ID then voided the sale.

I was embarrassed and confused because I have never heard of this happening to any of my 21 and over friends. They didn't apologize for the inconvenience or anything. They were honestly pretty rude about it. I felt like I was in trouble for something even though I am of legal age and my friend wasnt even going to be there when I drank the bottle with my other legal friends.< /text>< Rate>

Tire center is not great with customer service. I called to make an appointment and they told me they only took walk-ins, then I show up and they tell me it will be a 2 hour wait because of all the people WITH APPOINTMENTS!  And don't plan on getting any work done while you wait, no wifi or place to sit and plug in a computer. There's a bench where you can stare at the wall. Awesome.</Review>

Easy in easy out. Big parking lot that doesn't stay full very long.
They do have an organic section, but they move their products around a lot, making it hard to keep track.

Hi my name is Nancy, I just went grocery shopping today. Honestly, I have never ever encountered any bad costumer service before, but the customer serviced I received today was horrific. My cashier’s name was Virginia H. She made a big deal about our groceries just because we asked for a box. It is not our job to help her out. It is not our business that Costco is understaffed that information should be kept to herself. Complaining to the costumers instead of talking to her manager that she can not comply with her job. Or even give a satisfactory costumer service. I should have said something to her manager but instead I’m leaving this review so everyone can be aware. We simply wanted to go grocery shopping in peace.< /Review>

I like this Costco. The staff is friendly and helpful you can always find someone to help you. The pharmacy staff is especially friendly as well. There are other Costcos I like better only because they're bigger and they have more choices. This Costco sometimes brings in things that I really really like and then I go back to get it again and they don't carry it anymore. But they're happy to look it up for me and tell me what other Costco I can find that item....if I want to drive that far. I really like that they seem to buy with a conscience.  several things I've researched.... then I see it at Costco it seems like they've done the research as well because they've chosen quality or organic. Or sustainable resources. I really like that they use miss Granville to oversee the places they get their beef from.<//text>

Great store within insane deals as long as you don't mind buying 1000 of something lol. But seriously the food is great, their meat selection is wonderful, and there's enough liquor here to get the entire army hammered. I basically got the executive membership just for the samples.<//review>

I enjoy this Costco because it's quicker to go through the checkout line and find items in the aisle. Exception would be when they rearranged the aisles a few times every year causing me to hike up and down every aisle to find a commodity item. This time they moved the bread towards the front of the store and the snack/nuts to the back.  Why?  Sometimes I go to a different store because I know where the item is going to be on the shelf.  However all in all I do like the Costco at Sand City.  They are usually quick with service wether it be the photo counter or eye glass counter or food court or like the electronics department always have worker ask if I have any questions.< /Review>

My only concern is why can't anyone use the exit side if you need to use the restroom or place an order if you do not have a membership card...? Everyone use the restroom right...?! Nough said... Just something to consider😬😲😕< /review>

One of the things that I like the most is that Costco has already done the research i.e. Cell phones. If I go to the Verizon store I have so many choices it's mind-boggling and I like to know what the differences are between models so my research takes a long time. But with Costco I can rest assured they've already done the research and chosen the few models that they let Verizon and the other networks sell. So it makes it easier for me to make a decision based on size price and features. I love that they have a pharmacy I use the photo department often. Their meat is some of the best meat I've ever eaten. I like that they are affiliated with Temple Grandin for beef. I think Costco has a conscience. I think they're trying to help keep us healthy by giving us healthier choices.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I was on the fence about buying a membership for the longest time. Finally, I bit the bullet and gave it a shot. If you are still debating it, go for it. In addition to large warehouse store offerings, I was surprised to see how large of a selection of organic foods they had. The prices are very reasonable. Keep in mind, it's a warehouse store; so, whatever you buy, be prepared to buy it in bulk.<//Review>< Pictures>

Costco is Costco except when they can't take your payment. If you are travelling from Canada and you don't have a Visa card or a debit card that isn't tied to Mastercard then you should have enough cash to pay for your purchases. They don't accept MasterCard Debit. The in store ATM was down today as well.</Text>

<Review>I love costco, if you are trying to stick to a budget, please have a list and stick to it for it so so easy to find thing you didn't know you needed or thing you just plain and simple want. Produce wise I enjoy their spinach bag and the frozen mango (it makes the best smoothie). Please buy yourself the cheescake in the bakery, at least once in your life (skip the cake with 3 layers that looks like it has pastry cream, it was a sad fail). On the toiletry section there is the option of buying the house brand shampoo and conditioner, its the best I have used in a long time. It is cruelty free and smells amazing.< /Review>< response>

<review>The staff are exceptional, but then again this is a Costco. I love the Return's plicy. I must admit that at least 80% of the stock is not what you really need, but its nice to have a walk around. I always buy my computers, TV's or other expensive items from Costco, as their guarantee is one of the best on the market.<//review>< Rating>

Rude ass security guard wants to be a pig, but he’s a minimum wage loser. I quit doing business with rude people because there is nothing they sell I can’t buy elsewhere, and life should be about more than bitter failures. Keep the parking lot safe, Barney.</review>

<Review>Costco is a lifesaver for young professionals. There is no other place that I can feed myself and my partner (he eats a lot anyway!) affordably. We buy rice, eggs, oatmeal, quinoa, meat, kimchi, and cheese here and freeze the meat to cook throughout the month. One day we will be able to afford more sustainably sources meats, but for now Costco is the best option.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Customer Service was wonderfully helpful with my return.
Check out rang up 2 pairs of pants when I was just getting 1 pair and the other was just for a price.  Had to go back to customer service to get my money back.</text>

<date>1453794701215< /date><rate>4</rate><Review>This costco location of very convenient. Pretty much in the middle of the area, and right off the freeway. So there's no need to go deep into the city if your passing through the area on the freeway. The only downsides are that there's no gas station, which isn't a surprise as space is limited here and the traffic would be horrendous, and sometimes it can really get crowded, especially at checkout. Again, that just might be expected at Costco though. Overall, great store!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>Good store. Sometimes some of the staff can be a little rude. Especially the demo people. I was walking by and stop infront of a demo station before it was open because it was clear of other customers and I had space to  look at my list and not be in the way. Then a very rude lady said "ya were not serving food right now". I said "Oh I'm just looking at my shopping list (and smiled). No friendly smile back, then as I walked away another lady said people are so impatient that's why I hate this job. I don't even eat the demos!</review><username>Lillie Reed<//username><gmap_id>0x808de4f2987977b5:0x640f440d101b5695< /gmap_id><userid>103097008073116312780</userid>< Resp>

<review>Why would you go to any other grocery store or appliance outlet? Those places only exist so that Costco can't have a monopoly on the market for these goods. In quality, quantity, and price they are unbeatable! Even thier clothing selection is getting better and better, pay $20 for a gortex rainshell instead of $70 at REI. Get actual money back by upgrading to executive membership, get even more cash back by getting the citi card. You've thought about it... just do it, its well worth it because you're already saving so much more than going to your corner store or even outlets. ALSO, the food court can't be beat, if this location had gas pumps I would give it 6 stars.</review></record>

Normal Costco. A little smaller than other Costco stores and therfore, less choices. This is normal in Monterey by the way.<//text>

What's NOT to love! I can safely say that if I was allowed to exclusively visit ONE store only and no other...it would be Costco!!! Saturdays are super busy but that's my day of choice regardless of the longer lines. Their organic section is fabulous and their meat and poultry are fresh, hormone free and delicious! If you go early enough...there's a fair bit of food sampling going on, however this tends to vary from day to day. Their mixed unsalted nuts are a show stopper at $17.99 (cashews, almonds, pecans, and pistachios). Not a lot of vegan options yet unfortunately, and a lot of their vitamins and supplements are full of fillers - hence I recommend either Whole Foods or Trader Joe's for those! Having said that, their Megared Krill Oil and the Kirkland brand co-enzyme Q10 capsules are awesome.< /review>

Helpful customer service, but constantly rearranged, so it's often hard to find what you're looking for.< /Review>

Had an unpleasant shopping experience at costco , My cashier , Joe bennet was Rude and inpatient , instead of being civil and good mannered he decided to raise his tone in front of others due to a simple unintentional error, and I as a member felt completely disrepected and expected better customer service from a very well known company hope my next experience is better.<//Text>

Staff has no idea where anything is stocked! Ask them where the sodas are, they don't know. Ask them where the detergent is, they don't know.

Outside of that, service is reasonable. Management will solve 90% of your problems.<//review>

Rude staff! Wasn't greeted by the person at the door when I walked in even though I said "Hello" and looked directly at him and then the person checking my receipt when I left ignored me too. I'd rather drive 25 minutes to Salinas to go to their Costco than come back here.</review>

I do not understand why Costco's tire service in Sand City have such a long wait, 2-3 hrs just to get your tires rotated when they only ( I think) do tires, it doesn't take that long to have my car serviced at the dealer or any other shop. Geeezzzz< /review>
