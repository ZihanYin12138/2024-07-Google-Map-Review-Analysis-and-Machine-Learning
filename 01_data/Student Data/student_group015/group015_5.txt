This has been amazing for my 18yr. old dachshund.  Abby has been more active and enjoying life. I really believe it has helped with the sun sensitivity that goes along with her cataracts, she seems to stay outside longer and is much more comfortable. You should atleast try it. I give Abby two drops in a Pill Pocket, which is the recommended dose that the company also supplies and she takes it no problem.<//Text>

I bought the Salmon with Hemp for my Two dogs one is 3 and the other is 12 and what a difference I’ve seen in my 12 year old especially. He’s so shiny now and doesn’t seem to be sore like he used to be. He’ll even play with my 3 year old pup now and act like he’s 3. I love this stuff and the company is great if you have any issues with the website.</Text>

<text>I am very impressed with Innovet! The customer service team is great and helped me swiftly when I had an issue. So far, my dogs love their products. I really do think my female Great Dane is improving in her mobility since her amputation surgery from bone cancer. She has so much more pep in her step. I know I’ll be using this company in the future</text>< Pictures>

From the pure eyes, multi vitamin, advanced probiotic,  and the Pure CBD.  They are a great company and I respect how much the love and care for all the pets and people that order from them.  They truly make me feel part of the family and my bulldog Lucy loves everything that I have bought from them.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been a customer for just over a year, ever since our ancient and venerable Border Collie, Danica, took a serious tumble in the middle of a snowstorm and couldn't get up.  She needed help for her arthritis.  I read every article I could find on CBD and joint supplements.   Innovet's Advanced Mobility Chews were one of the few I found which had research and data to back up their claims.  We have gradually increased the number of products we use.  Every product is the highest quality. The customer service is outstanding and orders arrive when they are promised.</text>

I wish I would’ve discovered them sooner. I swear by the CBD & BioPel. Thanks to the CBD, my elderly Cane Corso went from barely keeping up with her much younger siblings to running along side them. The BioPel has done remarkably well at keeping fleas & ticks at bay. I tell everyone who will listen about them. 🙂<//Review>

One of our staple products! These are excellent. We have used the Advanced Skin & Coat Soft Chews for over a year and without knowing my supplement routine, our oldest daughter complimented their coat. They rarely scratch so I believe the skin is healthier also. I full recommend.< /review>

I have tried five different products I decided this is the best one for my dog. It is cost-effective, half the price of some of the other ones. One drop is the same as one dropper in a lot of other products. It’s much easier just to add a little bit to my dog’s treats or food. He seems mentally more relaxed. I am pleased with the product.</Text>

Premature review. My senior chihuahua mix dog has had a heart murmur for many years and has had heart failure a few times. I’ve tried for years to get medication for this without spending a fortune amount of money. Long story, I found a wonderful vet doctor who gave me the heart medication and for about 6 months he’s been doing good. These last few week he caught a cold and cough, which caused his heart murmur to go out of hand. I search and found this company which would not fix his medical problems, but calm him down, to allow the medication and heart to not be overwhelmed. It’s been just one day, and this CBD has helped. He’s much calmer and not coughing. Going to revisit the vet doctor and see what happens from his prognosis. He went from the emergency doctor saying he won’t make it home, to almost back to life. Will update later more.</text>

<text>I purchased 90 capsules for my 94 lb labrador for her pain and arthritis at her old age. I was slightly confused about the dosage and messed up by not understanding. I was trying other avenues instead of medication that was expensive. However, after buying and realizing that the right amount for her and pain levels are like 25 a day, I might as well buy the medication that I couldn't afford in the first place. They seemed to help her sleep better at night and even in the day. I'm just trying to make her comfortable and not break the bank. But I'm still searching....... Overall good product but way too expensive with her other medications. Prices are better than others though! Fast shipping!</text>< Pics>

I found this product through my moms recommendation and I’m so thankful for it. It’s helped my service dog so much. He has not had a seizure since he started his cbdeeber as I call it. He is so happy to have it that he will dance while I put the drops on his treats and I swear he just inhales it when I put it down. I’m super excited to try the shampoo. I’m hoping with my next order. Please give it a try if your on the fence. I was very skeptical at first myself but I’m so glad I took the plunge.</Text>

My two pups each have their own issues, but this has really made all the difference! One has severe allergies and is VERY sensitive and this has helped tremendously. She was also dealing with some anxiety which this has calmed her down a little bit, I still want to up her dosage to see how she does. The other has helped her so much with anxiety and her reactivity she is now a happy pup not scared of everyone and anything! I HIGHLY recommend!! If I can give more stars I will. Their customer service is also great.<//Text>

We have 3 dogs, of which one has anxiety and another who is a rescue that is still adjusting to our home and routines. All three love the hemp treats! Our older dog really enjoys the softer ones. We use the treats and CBD oil and they are great for anxiety! Innovet has really helped our furry friends.<//text>

Innovet's CBD oil saved my cats life, literally.  She was given a life expectancy of 6 months with aggressive treatment for cancer.  She was down to 3.5 pounds from 8.  I started her on their CBD oil and that saved her.  Within months she had gained her weight back and started eating regularly and stopped vomiting.  That diagnosis was almost 3 years ago and she's maintained  her fighting weight.  7.5# and 14 years old!< /review>

We started our senior 11 year-old dog on the Innovet Pet CBD oil about two weeks ago and it has definitely eased her pain.  She is sleeping through the night and wakes up with energy.  Yesterday morning she climbed up onto the bed to snuggle, she has not been able to do that for months.  We are happy and thankful that we discovered them!<//text>

I have bought the CBD drops and the peanut butter for my dog.  They both work well and now she sleeps through the night without grunting and groaning from her old age.  Their products are competitively priced and they have excellent customer service.  I highly recomment them.<//Text>

My sweet old lab, Gilly Girl, has tried pain meds and different CBD oils. Innovet CDB Oil, by far, has proven the best results for her & it is the best priced product I have found. She was struggling to go up & down the porch stairs and now she can go up & down them with ease.<//Text>

Through my searching for CBD oil for my dog, to help her anxiety and pain relief after a surgery.  The oil i bought does well to relax her and help her sleep well, when before she was uneasy and wouldn't sit still due to anxiety and pain.  Dosing charts and many different choices for their products made it easy to find what you need..  Would recommend to anyone who needs CBD for their pets.< /Text>

Innovet hemp hard chews have helped both my elderly golden retriever get through thunderstorms and my labrador puppy rescue get through some petty bad separation anxiety. These are amazing and get my pups through the tough times - I highly recommend!< /review>

I got the the 750 mg CBD oil for my Rat Terrier, Magic, who has bad separation anxiety - howling and barking, pacing all over my condo.  I have to give him the strong dosage but it helped a lot.  So happy to be using something natural to ease his anxiety instead of drug.</text>

Prompt customer service. I was worried as my dog is very anxious and I had a change in my schedule that required me to be out of the home. With COVID, he has definitely grown more attached and has anxiety attacks when I leave. At the suggestion of a friend, I bought some CBD for his anxiety. I haven't seen many reviews for CBD and dog anxiety, but thought "why not."

As of now, the CBD seems to be making a difference in his anxiety. He appears to be calm when I leave and is less reactive when he sees other dogs on walks.

10/10 - would definitely recommend.<//Text>

Our rescue dog has always had very bad anxiety, loud noises, rain, strong winds, fireworks, thunders and many others. A friend of mind recommended Innovet Pet Products and I'm glad we gave it a try!  I've been giving her the cbd oil or the hemp treat when we know she'll get an anxiety attack and what a difference it makes. Her anxiety are way more manageable and she became a lot calmer without appearing to be sedated compared to the anxiety meds her vet prescribed.<//text>

Originally, I bought CBD for my dog's anxiety from Innovet. She loves the taste! Since then I've purchased probiotics because she had bad breath that was coming from her tummy. It has really helped and she doesn't go out eating grass all the time now.
I next purchased mobility support (which I crush into her food to keep the mess down) to help her in her senor years. She was diagnosed with Cushing's and I want to give her the quality supplements to support her health.
I earned a free supplement and chose to try the vitamins. She likes all their products and has rejected other company's probiotics and supplements. I love this company and wouldn't switch to another for my dog's needs.<//Review>

<review>I have a rescue blue heeler who was not only a police dog she was a Frisbee Champion. as she got older she was no longer of any use . and i was Blessed with an amazing dog.  Her pain in her legs and in her back from when she got shot get to her . I tried every thing and a friend mentioned pure hemp. I tried the lower dose for small dogs just in case she could be allergic and after 2 months she grabs her meds and barks to get them 2 times a day then goes to bed . her pain is sometimes weather induced. Thank you so Much Innovet The pure hemp oil is working.< /review>< Date>

<text>My name is Cheryl Turman for Homosassa Florida, I have two older chihuahua's they are both 17 years young. They were spending most of their time sleeping and I was looking for a product that would help them have a more active life. With the help of Mobility Support and the Multivitamin 6-in-1 soft shews my little ones are more active and seem brighter and more alert.

I've been using their products since I found out about their superior CBD oil for dogs. They are one of the earlier businesses that offered CBD oil for pet. Not only their CBD is great, their treats, as well as other products (I love their  Poo Poo bags!) They offer free shipping with very responsive customer service.< /review>

< Review>
I have used Innovet for quite a few of my older huskies with mobility issues. One, who was 16 years old could barely walk. I gave her the liquid cbd oil and within hours, literally, she was walking better. Continued using the product and she lived another eight months.  Now using mobility tabs for an older dog and she is doing great despite some disc problems in her back.(Drifter, pictured here.) I recommend these products to everyone with pets having issues they can help. They are not a cure, but they sure help them live a better life.</Review>

Innovet CBD oil 250 has helped my 9 year old Dachshund to overcome seizures and not being able to walk.  CBD oil has been a miracle for her.  She  had kennel cough, since I brought her back from the rescue 7 years ago.  I am still fighting the hacking cough.  The CBD oil is helping her not spit up at the end of the cough.<//Text>

Our 14-year-old gentlemen, Harley, has mobility and anxiety issues.  I really think the CBD drops help him.  He is definitely more relaxed and

< Review>
Innovet's CBD oil is a great product! My 6 year old Mastiff had arthritis and pain from elbow surgery years ago. I give him 8 drops of oil on a piece of bread every morning and night and this really helps to ease his pain!  Thank you Innovet!<//Review>

Great products! My two dogs love the soft hemp chews, my senior dog especially since they’re easy for her to chew. I also add their cbd oil to their food. My senior dog has arthritis and a sensitive stomach. Using both these products together have put the pep back in her step and given her an appetite again. I definitely recommend these products.<//Review>

<Review>Our girl was abandoned in a remote campsite in Dodge City, KS late year. She has separation anxiety and she is extremely food and water nervous, still worried she won't have either again. Innovet CBD oil has made a huge difference for her. We tried other brands, but this works so much better. We give it our retired racing greyhound too for a shoulder injury and have been able to take her off prescription pain meds. Thank you!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDA4TfA7RgClwxyS-IHJjq7vgls5GTHbMGsO7P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrZ5uU4LS3M4TXeUuC0B_rLwIv43m0wS1lsZnp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<text>CBD oil and capsules help my 15 year old border collie with arthritis pain and anxiety. She moves around more easily and sleeps through the night. Prior to starting these products she couldn't get outside or sleep through the night. After two weeks I started seeing results and have been giving it to her for a year now. She's getting out on longer walks of 2-3 miles in the woods a couple of times a week.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2caa8c04c78dd:0xbfee1eae430a75ca< /gmap_id>< response>

<text>So happy with this product!  I was skeptical of it's pain relief properties and worried that my dog wouldn't take it.  It has been very easy to give to her and done wonders for her mobility.

<Text>Our senior (9 year, almost 10) 104 lb GSD X Golden was recently diagnosed with osteosarcoma. We were given 2-6 months as a timeline to expect since he is not a good candidate for amputation. We want as much quality time with him as possible, so we turned to alternative therapies to assist us with that. He wasn't showing any major signs of discomfort before, but he's been on CBD now for 2ish weeks and he's started playing like a pup! It's been so great to see some zest from him and extra pep in his step.<//Text>< response>

I originally starting buying CBD Oil for our Blue Healer. She had mobility issues and her pain pills (Carprofen) weren't helping much.  I added the CBD Oil to her regimen. What a difference! She moves around much better. Our German Shepherd has severe allergies. He gets kinda crazy, at times, with the itching. He gets a lot of relief withe CBD Oil. He now sleeps through the night.. He still needs other meds for his allergies. However, the CBD Oil helps!<//Text>

<Review>The products that I get from Innovet have made noticeable, positive changes for my dogs and their lives. I found Innovet because I wanted to find ways to help support my aging dogs, and the CBD products they offer for dogs have been amazing. I have also purchased treats and supplements from this company, and have yet to be disappointed. I appreciate the reward/point program they provide, and I have yet to not find a discount for the products I am interested in purchasing. The standard shipping takes about 7-9 days from the time of purchase, so I would plan ahead if you want to reorder something, but they just added auto-ship options, which makes orders from them even easier.</Review><UserId.>116204570198647791892<//UserId.><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< username>

Ty is a 14 y/o 9lb Chihuahua who suffers from arthritis, joint pain, and extreme mobility issues (poor little guy stumbles and falls down often). Over the past few weeks, PurCBD oil has helped give him some comfort and mobility back. Every little bit counts. He loves having his treats with a few drops on them. Plus, the oil brought back his appetite! Just a couple weeks ago he wouldn't touch his food, now he gobbles it up with delight every day. Thank you Innovet for helping Ty make the most of his golden years.<//Text>

<Review>Bought the CBD oil for my 8 year old Boston &  within 24 hours he was doing great. We are a week into using the product & he has not had a seizure since. A week ago we were contemplating on if his quality of life was worth allowing him to suffer anymore, today he is thriving & acting like a puppy again. This has saved his life & heartache for our family!</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><username>Stephanie Siller<//username>< Time>

If you truly love your pet dont spend a dime with this chop shop of a company. Go with the  big names more expensive product its with every penny!!! This place has one guy who's answers the phones sends emails and is the manager. Some how my package ended up in Las Vegas and the manager Jason decided to make my pet and I wait for it to find it's way back to southern California!! I live less than a half hour where they ship from!!! Any true pet lovers would have shipped a new package ASAP... as of today my package is still in las Vegas. Innovet is a pet shop that recently started making cbd for dogs for profit no history behind this company at all . That's why 3 bottles cost $54.....<//review>

{'time': 1595888057267, 'text': 'Hello Arty,\n\nWe are sorry to hear that you feel this way. Free Economy shipments are made affordable because they are shipped in bulk and consolidated to processing centers. For example, orders going to San Francisco will be consolidated to a processing center in North Las Vegas before going to San Fransisco. Your order was delivered in one week from the ship date and three days less than the original timeframe that was quoted. We make our shipping timeframes displayed when selected a checkout. We understand there is delays with USPS due to " Limited Transportation Availability As A Results Of Nationwide COVID-19 Impacts". For this reason, we have lowered the prices of our expedited shipping options if you are looking to receive a package within a guaranteed timeframe. Our company has plenty of history. We have been making pet health products since 2005 and were one of the first to introduce CBD to the pet market in 2016. We understand how costly it can become when owning a pet. For that reason, we have always made our prices as affordable as possible and have even introduced a Price Match Policy. As the economic impact COVID-19 has brought and to help make it easier to care for your pets in June we even lowered the prices of our PurCBD+.

Using the Hemp pellets for my horse to help with spookiness and some pain issues that a Chiropractor Vet has helped with adjustments. Great product only using half the dose per day and she has become her usual calm self. I highly recommend this product.
Also have used the CBD oil 250 for my cat. She had anxiety issues that had her constantly itching and licking herself. Only took a couple of weeks using 3 drops in the morning and 2 in the evening for her to leave herself alone. Now her hair has grown back and she is relaxed and sleeping well. CBD oil is very to administer and my cat does not resist.</text>

Excellent company, found all the information I needed on their website.  Product works great for us - I have 2 dogs with severe thunderstorm anxiety and their CBD oil is like MAGIC for my dogs... I've tried everything and with just a few drops, they are completely calm and sleep through thunderstorms.  It's amazing and let's me sleep as well since they are not upset.  Customer for life!< /review>

As a young dog at four he just has the biological disposition for plaque even though he eats a raw diet and has bones all the time. Pure breath has enabled me to simply read this on his teeth and brush them and have the practice off. Highly recommend it very easy and he absolutely loves the taste of the peppermint.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

Our 19 y.o. mixed breed was at the end of her life. She was in pain, poor appetite,  hip pain, and declining rapidly. We were not ready to let go. After starting her on the full spectrum CBD she began eating and surprisingly running! We added the Wag Balm and rubbed  it into her hips. Not only did she walk with little pain, but hair began growing in an area where flea allergies left her fur less. Innovet gave us 6 months longer with her. After her passing we continued using the full spectrum CBD and Mobility Support on our 11 y.o Chihuahua with the same results. Savannah laps down the CBD  and even will remind us if it is time for her dose. Our 7 y.o. Merle Chihuahua, Zeus and 7 y.o. mixed breed, Dixie are currently on the Alaskan Salmon Oil. Not only has their skin improved, but the colors in  their fur are amazing. The shedding has decreased!
We are forever  and loyal customers of Innovet Pet Products.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I have been using Hemp Dog treats for my female German Shepherd, Brandy now for about 6 or 7 weeks.  Brandy is 13 1/2 yrs old and has DM for which there is no cure.  I had tried some other products to help with her mobility issues, but did not notice any big difference.  Then I found these treats and other products.  After giving her these treats for the past 6 weeks my wife and I have noticed a bit of improvement with her.  I will try anything to help her out and these have given some help.<//Review>< Rate>

I ordered CBD oil for my 14yr old Boston Daisy. She has dementia and goes through sundowner syndrome. Sometimes it's really bad with the panting and repeat pacing, confusion. I feel so bad for her. I never knew that it existed in dogs. I did allot of research on it and was shocked how common in older dogs it really was. I decided to go the holistic rout and I'm glad I did. The CBD oil helps greatly but unfortunately it's not a cure. It really only gets worse but at least I can give her some comfort. Thank you Innovet Pet for a wonderful product.< /Text>

We’ve been really happy with Innovet’s products and service. I’ve had amazing results with the CBD oil and treats as a natural alternative to prescription medication for joint pain and anxiety. Sami loves the taste of the joint treats so it’s never an issue getting her to eat them. I even slip some training in. I’ve also used the skin and coat formula when she was experiencing severe allergy issues and her skin was itchy and broken out. It really seemed to help. Thank you Innovet!< /review>

<Text>This is a miracle oil!! It truly has saved my diabetic 3 pound chihuahua. He has no appetite, this oil has opened up his appetite like you would not believe,  I was running out of this amazing CBD, decided to try another company. It almost killed him! I had to rush order a bottle from Innovet Pet Products. I started him on it again, within two days, he was back to normal. Thank you Innovet. We are hooked lol< /Text>< Pictures>

My 14 year old Lab, Clyde, has been responding wonderfully to his CBD Oil, for months now, getting around much better, and napping soundly. We recently started the Mobility Support Chews, and though haven't had time yet to see how they work, Clyde definitely looks forward to getting them, so they must be tasty. I just wish I had discovered Innovet's CBD years ago.  Stephen B.<//Text>

My dog had been dealing with pain from luxating patellas and this has helped her mobility tremendously. It is a lifesaver. She also has anxiety and she seems much calmer. A great product. I will be introducing this to her sister as well. Great price for such an amazing product.< /text>

Our 45-pound, 14-year old Black Mouth Cur was limping and moving less, and while Rimadyl helped, it's not good for chronic use. On the salmon and sweet potato hemp treats, she moved better, not limping, and even being frisky at times. Now we have her on the Mobility Support chews, which she eats eagerly. They have clearly improved the old girl's quality of life.<//text>

<Review>Highly recommended!  My 14 year old Golden Retriever has a hard time getting up. I have been giving this to her 3 times a day on a biscuit and she loves it.  It has helped her getting up and getting around.  Make sure you get the 750 for a dog over 100 lbs like my girl<//Review>< Pics>

I have been giving the Advanced Multivitamin soft chewswith Hemp to my 14 year old dachshund for about a week now and can already notice the difference in his coat health, increased mobility, and less itching. Great value for a really great product. Thank you for helping out my little old men! :)<//Text>

I am a big believer in the benefits of CBD and Hemp as well as fish oils and prefer to give my girl natural products whenever possible.  I also try to stay a head of any possible illnesses or injuries as she is a Gentle Giant and treating her can get costly and difficult. This product not only seems to be helping her joints but her coat and has the cardiovascular benefit as well which, with a deep chested dog, is fantastic!  I look forward to continuing to add this to her regular daily routine!  Thanks for another great product Innovet!</Text>< resp>

I have used many products from Innovet Pet Products from pup shampoo to hot spot spray to the dog treats and any very happy with all the products that I have purchased. They have great customer service and are always helpful when I have a question and I usually have a few before I purchase.
I will continue to purchase from this company!</text>

<text>Hemp treats
Had been using another's liquid but tried these as they are easier to administer. My dog has had seizures and joint issues and these seem to give her as much relief as the drops did and she loves them as treats so no problem taking them! I have 2 additional rescues that could benefit also so I'm ordering 4 more bags.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2caa8c04c78dd:0xbfee1eae430a75ca<//gmapID>< rating>

I'm from Canada and couldn't find a "functional" feeding syringe to feed my sick cat. I purchased the 30cc soft tipped Silicone feeding syringe and couldn't be happier! It works fantastic with the dial a dose! No more food on the walls or ceiling, no banging my cats teeth with hard plastic, great product I highly recommend.< /Text>

Advanced Probiotic Chews have helped my 10-year-old dog with loose stools caused by allergy drugs he takes. He used to produce cow patties and now his stool is firm. The probiotics in the chews are really helping him.<//text>

Once again the Innovet team has proven how absolutely awesome and focused on the customer they really are.

Let me preface this with: I am not looking for free products, discounts or any other special treatment.

And to be absolutely clear, the customer is not always right.

We recently had an incorrectly shipped order. I reached out to Brandon for help in getting their product returned and getting a missing item to us. Brandon was the soul of tact and customer service. I was not looking to get anything out of it and because of our interactions previously with Brandon I just needed a shipping address to get the excess items back to the company.

Brandon was not only polite, witty, and helpful, we had the missing products within a couple of days! That shows that the company is willing to work with their customers.

Thank you to all of you, but especially to Brandon!< /Review>

I have a small terrier mix dog that has seizures.
I ordered the 125mg mix and was pleasantly surprised by how fast my order arrived, AND even before it did, I received an email from Innovet members asking if I had any questions they could help with.
Super friendly people that genuinely care about their clients and their humans.<//review>

My product was shipped quickly and securely, and I've been extremely pleased with the quality of their products and the research they've put into their offerings. Below, I've included my review for specifically the product I purchased.

My dog, Ava, is a four-year-old border collie lab mix, and she suffers from separation anxiety and noise aversion. I rescued her two years ago, and have been working on different treatment options with her ever since, from relaxation training (a behavioral approach) to psychiatric drugs. Some methods have helped more than others, but to this day she still struggles with her main triggers and I couldn't change her relationship with them while she was on psychiatric drugs. She was able to handle her triggers perfectly until she was weaned off the drugs, at which point her behavior seemed to revert to what it was before she started taking them!

Unlike psychoactive substances, the CBD oil seems to dull her perception of her triggers, rather than dulling her response the way many psychiatric drugs do (I think this allows her to experience and adapt her own response, rather than just having an artificially altered response). It's been about a month since she started taking the oil twice daily, and I never noticed any side effects whatsoever, plus she's been handling her triggers much better than ever before! I hope one day, many months down the road, I'll be able to wean her off of the oil and see a changed relationship with her triggers, but until then I'm so pleased with the visible improvement in her quality of life with the oil as a regular supplement!</Text>< date>

Sadie is 13 yo rescue. Began with arthritic joint pain over a year ago, and has 3 prescriptions and 2 supplements for pain and anxiety control. She has almost finished her 1st bottle of Innovet CBD and her pain meds have been cut in half and her symptoms are in remission! Both of us are extremely happy!<//text>

Recently, I started substituting InnoVet hemp treats for their noon dosage and they absolutely love them.  As with the CBD oil, it increases their energy level, reduces their joint pain and increases their appetite. Thank you Innovet for making my pets so much happier and healthier.

Don't even think twice about buying the CBD Oil & Mobility Chews for your pets.  I have been using the CBD oil on my female (13)who suffers from anxiety, and it has been a dream, she is doing great.  I added the Mobility Chews for my male (12) who was having trouble walking, and they are a miracle, honestly - within a week of giving them to him he was already improving.  Great product.</review>

<Review>This is the first time I used CBD oil for my dogs. I gave the CBD oil to my older male lab because he is starting to get up slow and didn't have the energy to chase his ball.  He acted like a younger dog the very next day. It has been a week now and he is back retrieving his ball and he moves around so much better. I know the oil won't heal him but it will help him live with less aches and pains as he continues to age. I highly recommend this oil.</Review>< rating>

I just love how great the Innovapet products help my 18 yr old girl.  The PurCBD+ had brought new life to my ol' lady.  Her cataracts is gone her appetite is back to normal and she's got more prep on her step.  Is like she's young again.  They are fast on delivery too, so she doesn't have to miss a dose.  Im excited to get her new year's today.< /review>

Our 14 year old dog is showing great results from this product. His arthritis isn't as severe; he doesn't stumble on walks as much, he is able to get up from a laying position without as much trouble and he's generally a bit more spunky. Very excited to have found this product and hope the positive results stay consistent. Thank you<//review>

<review>CBD oil helped my old dog quickly recover from vestibular syndrome (nausea, weakness, dizziness), and I've continued to give it to him for arthritis and anxiety. I buy from Innovet because they provide good information about the source and quality of their CBD oil, as well as dosage recommendations. Shipping and follow-up communication are excellent.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2caa8c04c78dd:0xbfee1eae430a75ca<//gmapID></record>

My senior cat started showing signs of arthritis years ago. She was controlled well with joint supplements until the last few months. After 2 weeks on CBD oil, she was no longer calculating her jumps quite as long, and she was jumping between pieces of furniture easier. A month on CBD now, she is incredibly relaxed, leaping without a problem and no hesitation, and overall seems to be feeling much better. This has been her favorite sleeping position lately. Thank you, Innovet, for an amazing product that Kaala actually enjoys taking! There was fast shipping, and even had a product labeled specifically for my state. Kaala and I appreciate your attention to detail and the quality of your product!<//review>

< review>
Last November I adopted an 8 year old Collie.  He was pretty gimpy, not just arthritis, but from a broken leg when he was a puppy which was never treated. )c: Someone suggested I get him CBD oil, I researched, seems what they sell on Amazon is not real CBD so I was advised to try Innovet. The difference is monumental, he moves like a young dog. Wasn't sure it was the CBD, so didn't order a second bottle, waiting for a sale, within days I could see him going downhill.  He will never be without it again...... It really is an excellent product.</review>

Our almost 15 year old black lab is really benefitting from the organic Hemp oil!! He was so sick a month ago, struggling with breathing, not eating or toileting normally and his back legs were not working. It was awful to watch and we were ready to make ‘the decision’ because we didn’t want him to suffer. I don’t know how I happened on this product at the same time, but I am so glad I did! His energy levels are up, he’s eating and toileting regularly, his anxiety is way down, which helps his breathing, and he is sleeping great! He still struggles with his back legs, but I wasn’t expecting a cure all and he doesn’t appear to be in pain. The vet seems pleased with the progress and treatment too!</Text>

Innovet pet products has truly been a life saver, my Senior Mastiff has been using CBD little over a year, has given her a better quality of life, her spunk is back, we can take longer walks, she's almost 10 170 lbs, she eats well, her coat is amazingly softer. The list can go on.. We wouldn't go a day without. So happy to have researched and found Innovet.<//review>

<Text>I never actually received their product. This review is for the business and customer service. Innovet charged me $25+ for 3-day shipping for an order  placed on Thursday.  The tracking information they sent me said it would be delivered the following Wednesday. My email to request a remedy was responded to with gibberish about a different shipping company. The second response was to ask me for additional shipping fees to get the order in 3-days. In addition there is no way to cancel an order online once it is placed. Also their phone system is fully automated and awful.<//Text><Time>1561744091155</Time></record></dataset><record>

I've become an avid believer in CBD oil and after purchasing a dud from my local store, I came across Innovetpet and am too afraid to try anything else because of how great it works. My 11 year old lab suffers from seizures, which may be brought on from mast cell tumors. The numerous, hard-hitting medications from the vet were working to decrease Read more about

them, but she was so medicated that she was no longer enjoying life or able to go about a normal day. After working with my vet, I've been able to decrease her prescriptions down to the lowest doses and supplement with CBD. Since then she's only had one very mild seizure, which was drastically reduced by immediately giving her CBD. I'm a believer!</Text>

We run a small no-kill rescue in Colorado and keep Innovet CBD oil on hand at all times for the dogs. We use it for our frosted faces that have typical aches & pains related to older age, as well as for our younger dogs to help alleviate anxiety during the crazy Colorado thunderstorms.

One of our older dogs also had chronic bouts of nausea until we started her on CBD. She is doing much better and rarely ever has any nausea anymore, thanks to the CBD oil.

We love it and will continue to stay stocked up on this amazing serum! Thank you for such wonderful customer service and also making it affordable for people to use.

Thank you from all the dogs at Graceland Animal Rescue & Sanctuary!! ----WOOF----</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8hYYl4iBShL_AanY7fQfGhNhLyb03QQLYGjU4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

I have a pittie named Gunner who has dwarfism in his legs feet and hip dysplasia in his back legs along with one knee replacement already. My baby boy is 2 years old and is not very active. One week ago I started him on innovet products and give him 250mg CBD oil and my puppy is back to his puppy self. He's back to running around and playing with his brother and this product has changed his life. I cried the first day he played with his brother.< /Text>

<review>My aging German Shepherd mix has severe arthritis and this product has made her much happier. This is the third brand of CBD oil I have tried on her and this one is definitely the keeper. We are very pleased with this product and won't buy it anywhere else.<//review>< pictures>

The CBD oil has been nothing short of miraculous for our dog Scout. When the prescription from our vet failed to take away her pain from significant arthritis, we tried Innovet’s CBDOil drops and the improvement of Scout’s condition has been wonderful. She no longer whimpers in the evening and her activity level has noticeable increases. This is a great product that is true to its word. Please, please, please, give it a try for your dog should he or she be riddled with arthritis.  It truly works....<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>The customer service at this company is outstanding.  I had made a mistake in my original order by entering the wrong address.  I only noticed my error after I had placed the order in (I was a first-time client), and was in  the fear of having my order sent to the wrong address before I was able to correct it.   I sent an email to the company notifying them of the issue and their immediate response and attention to my problem was surprisingly refreshing and reassuring.  Jay corrected my address immediately and I received my product in a timely manner.  This display of professionalism and attention to customers' needs has gained my loyal patronage.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>My 10 year old dog was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease where her white blood cells attack her other cells. She's forever on a low dose of prednisone steriod to keep her body balanced. Some of the side affects were weight gain and fur loss. Shes had this disease for almost her entire life. Since starting her on daily CBD oil for the past maybe 3 years, she's back to a healthy weight, her fur is thick again, and she's back to her happy puppy Jack Russell Terrier self. I love Innovet because you can read lab reports for products! So I know what I'm giving her is legit!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2caa8c04c78dd:0xbfee1eae430a75ca< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>My 11 year old golden retriever mix has always had anxiety, developed skin allergies over the last few years, and was starting to have joint issues making her limp. The medicine, and I think pain, was making her rather lethargic.

We started her on these CBD capsules and literally saw the difference within a day. After two weeks she is energetic, no more limping, and just seems happy! I have been able to reduce her anxiety medication in half and may reduce more as we go along. Haven’t reduced the allergy meds yet, but once completely clear from her recent flare up we will try reducing that one too!

My sweet Snickers is like a pup again, or at least not a senior dog!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

<Review>ordered the 750 mg cbd oil for my 65lb plot hound.  She could barely walk, couldn't do stairs and some days even door thresholds were a challenge. Prescription meds not working but this has been amazing.  Walks, stairs, runs in yard now.  Back to herself.  DIagnosed with severe back arthritis. This product has worked fabulously, great value and a little bit goes a very log way.  I dose it 3-4 drops ( 1 drop per 25lbs) twice daily. Thank you Innovet!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

<review>Our oldest dog has been bothered with arthritic hips for a few years now. We started her on Innovet's PURCBD 250 MG. She has not whimpered about any pain and she does well and is so happy when we go for walks. We have now started giving the product to our other two dogs.</review><time>1567958864420< /time><user_name>Steve Adams<//user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Approved by my Finicky Eaters..I have a pack of rescued seniors(10-15 years old) with a variety of age-related health problems. Only two will eat the CBD OIL Biscuits, but all seven, yes seven, love the soft chews for taste and texture. If they were less expensive I would have given 5 stars!!< /text>

I use the Treats for my 8yr old Welsh Terrier..she as a "neuro" prob with tremors in her rear legs..I had used the oil but feel the Treats give a more uniform and better relief.  Even my Vet is impressed with the results !!! The Treats are easier to deal with and she Luvs them< /text>

I’ve been purchasing the oil for my cat, Truman, who has cancer, and I purchase the dog treats for my two, large breed dogs, Zeva and Molly, who absolutely LOVE the treats.  Zeva is older in age, but really seems to have gotten her vitality back.  Truman is doing fantastic and takes his oil well....he actually likes taking it.  Innovet is a great company to deal with, and delivery is quick, customer service is second to none.</text>

My dogs love the cbd oil from Innovet. Unlike other companies, there's no strong smell which can turn off small picky chihuahuas like my own. So far so good, and the dropper is very easy to use!<//Review>

She seemed happier which I attribute to it must be helping with the pain. We finished trying out the 250 and based on those results and the good customer service as well, I just ordered the bigger dose bottle of 750. We’re all eager to get her started on that one!</review></record>

I recently purchased the Innovet CBD Oil for my senior dachshund. She is 13 years old and weighs about 12 lbs. Before I found Innovet I researched the affects of CBD oil for dogs with heart disease, as my furbaby suffers from it and ended up in the ER about a month ago. Since then she has been on heart medication and I have been giving her the CBD oil, 2 drops, twice a day with her food, and she seems to be responding extremely well! I'm really happy to have found Innovet! Would recommend 10/10!</Review>

<Review>I have been using Innovet CBD oil for my 12 year old heeler  He has cancer and is in hospice mode, so doing all we can to keep him comfortable and happy until he tells us "it's time".  He's on some major pain meds,  as well, but those seem to make him a little restless and antsy  When I give him the CBD, he seems to settle and is more comfortable....  Well, its been a few months since I wrote this first review....My sweet boy finally let us know it was time to go....we miss him terribly.....His littermate brother just had major back surgery and we have been using the soft CBD treats for him during his recovery.....I really like the soft treats....and so does he!  The CBD treats seem to help him settle and calm.  He has a long recovery ahead of him and I don't want to drug him if I don't have to....will be ordering more of them...</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2caa8c04c78dd:0xbfee1eae430a75ca<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was skeptical about the cbd supplement but I love my 14 year old Bichon and I was willing to try it to see if it could help with her lethargy which I attributed to her pain issues. I used 3 drops in her food and I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks. I couldn’t believe how playful and energetic she became. She’s jumping on the couch and bed with ease and she wants to chase her toys again like she did when she was younger. We also noticed that it helped her bowels and her stool is softer and not as dark as it was before. Healthy poop, healthy pup!  If you’re on the fence about it, give it a try. I’m glad I did and I’ll continue to use it for my princess.<//review>

<text>We started giving our 8 yr old lab rescue CBD oil drops (750mg) 3 weeks ago and the improvement in her gait has improved tremendously. She used to only want to fetch a few times before she needed to let down. Now we have to take away her toy to get her to stop.
Not only is the product amazing, the company got our product to us well before we anticipated its arrival. This allowed us to start giving our lab her supplement a few days earlier than we had thought possible!</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I love the CBD oil! We started using it for our Pittie's arthritis and it's worked wonders. She lives the taste of it, too. We also give it to our two other dogs for anxiety and it has helped both of them. This is a great product at a reasonable price!< /Review>

I purchased PurCBD oil for my 3 year old Maltese,  who after we moved developed separation anxiety. He has always been very hyper but after the move he would pace and whine while I got ready to go out. After 2 weeks Ollie has been much much calmer, and he doesn’t freak out when I’m getting ready to leave. This stuff is amazing. I give him three drops on his treat and in 25 min calm as can be. I’m a customer for life.< /Text>

Our 13 year old rescue collie/terrier mix has had joint issues for a few years now. As soon as CBD became legal it blew up online and in local shops. I knew I wanted to try the natural route and get some but there were so many different places selling it. Once I stumbled across this site and read the reviews and spoke to customer service I was sold. There was a money back guarantee and the price was good. Around the time I placed the order she had a vestibular syndrome spell. She lost coordination, was vomiting and wasn’t interested in eating. We were having to put a broth on her food to get her to eat. A couple days later she was getting back to her normal self and her CBD arrived. We started off with a low dose once a day and then brought it up to 22 drops on a treat twice a day. She’s moving around a lot better than before and her appetite is back. All I can say is if you’re weary of trying it out this site is your best bet. For a good price and 30 day money back guarantee AND a family owned business it’s worth a shot. I’m already about to order our next bottle.<//text>

I knew I had to do something for the inflammation and pain so I decided to try the CBD oil. Before the pain meds and CBD she couldn’t lie on her side without getting up whimpering from the pain. The CBD oil has allowed her to be pretty much pain free without the long term and negative side effects of the pain meds.

Thanks so much for your wonderful product!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Great products! My Labrador is almost 13 and had many joint surgeries. The cbd is a very useful addition to his treatment protocol and he is very much more comfortable when on the Cbd. In addition to the great product they are a great company to work with, great customer service and quick to answer questions.</review>

<Text>I have a senior 13 year old Yorkie. He has severe separation anxiety, and poor thing licks constantly. He licks everything, if hes on the couch, he licks the couch, if on my bed he'll lick the comforter...and he licks his paws which can turn into a problem if he makes it raw/infected etc. U get it. Well, this PurCBD Oil absolutely helps with the licking, I'm learning and adjusting the dosage I started low and worked up a bit to make sure hes OK. And, he is finally relaxed! I'm so happy. Oh, And I can see he's more comfortable moving around with his arthritis/joint issues! I'm going to reorder now & will continue to use! Please try this if your pet needs & Good luck to all!< /Text>< Pictures>

Our dog has anxiety which translates to her barking aggressively and it can be intimidating as she’s a Pit/Husky mix.

Our vet suggested trying cbd oil instead of medication and we couldn’t be happier with the results. She’s finally a more confident and relaxed dog!</review>

<review>Love the CBD oil. Originally, it was purchased for a dog with separation anxiety.  I went months coming home to a dog with wet feet and chin/throat.  (salivated so much, that by the time I got home, 7 hours later, his front was thoroughly wet. :( )    I tried other anxiety relievers, but nothing worked well enough. While I won't say he was  100% cured, he was not wet, when I came home.  And, usually he drank most of his water while I was gone.  He went back to 'normal' intake.  Now I use it for a pain reliever, as the dog I originally purchased it for has passed away. (nothing to do with separation anxiety issues)<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I purchased the CBD oil and treat bundle for my soon to be 15 year old Corgi after being referred to Innovet products from a friend who gives the oil & treats to her two dogs.  I have never tried using CBD oil before because I am a skeptic, but after seeing him have awful side effects from his vet prescribed anti-anxiety meds (Prozac & Trazodone), I thought I'd try it.  I purchased the 750 mg and I give him four drops morning and evening with his food.  He started the oil on June 7, 2019 and is now completely medication free and has had no nasty side effects!  His anxiety has been steadily decreasing and so has mine knowing that I am literally not poisoning him anymore!  I cannot recommend this oil (and the treats) enough and have already purchased more of the treats, which my two year old Heeler loves!  These products are well worth the cost and I can't thank Innovet enough for the peace of mind that both me and especially my dog have been given.  Thank you Innovet!</review>< user_name>

I have been using your CBD oil for around 1 yr now, my daughter told me about you and she was really pleased also...my 2 dogs are both seniors now and the oldest male basset hound has back leg issues...the CBD oil seems to help him get some mobility back. He seems to get a little more pep in his steps again. He sometimes seems to try to run and get spurts of energy more than normal, he also has some fear issues from noises and fast movements. this helps him stay relaxed and sleeps better. I am glad I found your CBD/Hemp oil products to help with my dogs pain and stiffness. Thanks</Text>

<text>My 13.5 year old yellow lab, Bess, is the Queen of our home.  Due to torn knees in her younger years (one had the TPLO surgery, the other we have just done conservative pain management), her arthritis at this age is pretty severe and she had started to have hind end weakness.  Her mind and her attitude weren't affected.  Our vet, who does conventional as well as holistic medicine, tried changing her meds and supplements, massage, acupuncture, the Asissi Loop, and chiropractic. Nothing helped much.  She said it was probably time to try CBD.  I did major research to find the best product, and everywhere I looked Innovet was at the top of the list.  We noticed improvement with her first dose!  I have been gradually increasing the dose as she is a large dog, and she is doing excellent.  I prayed for help for her and Innovet CBD oil was the answer to my prayers.  Her arthritis still bothers her slightly, and she still has a bit of hind end weakness that really comes out when we miss or are late on giving her a dose.  But this oil has honestly changed our lives and has given Bess back her mobility and her dignity.  She is still on her meds and supplements so this is an addition on top of that, but it is definitely the product that tips the scale to better for her.  I would never buy CBD from anyone else as I know she is getting the very best from Innovet. Thanks so much for giving us peace of mind and more time with our old gal!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

My dog, Kaya, had mast cell cancer. I had been hearing about CBD oil and knew that cancer was on the list of its benefits. Further, I heard it helped with anxiety, and Kaya, a rescue, has wicked separation anxiety. She weighs 45-50 pounds and my first order was for 125mg. I contacted Innovet for my second order and the wonderful customer service person recommended I try 750mg as the dosing would be much easier. And it is!
Kaya is one year out since surgery, and no recurrance. May never know for sure if it is the CBD oil, but at 13, Kaya is sometimes mistaken for a puppy and I love her bounce and energy. So I'm sticking with PURCBD by Innovet.< /text>

<review>I purchased this product for our senior pup who had arthritis issues in
her front legs which caused her to constantly lick the area.  She also
showed her discomfort by not being able to settle down for long.  The CBD capsules have worked wonders.  She has stopped the constant licking and seems more comfortable overall.< /review><rating>5< /rating></record>

I was cautious so I started him off on just one soft treat a day, cut in half, 2 times a day. He loves the treats and his appetite improved immediately! After weeks of hand feeding and begging him to eat, he's now enthusiastic about mealtimes. His mobility and cognitive issues are improving also.

<Text>My 8 yr old great dane Hank has been diagnosed w soft tissue sarcoma that is a slow growing cancer. It Has not yet metastasized. I started giving him cbd oil 750 twice daily for the past 13 days. He has an orange size lump on hind right thigh n several smaller growths elsewhere. We only had large tumor tested. I’m hoping to shrink or at least stop growth of tumor instead of surgery, that may or may not have removed the cancer. At his age, i felt this was a safer option. He seems to like taste well enough n doesn’t mind it added to dog treats or his food at dinner. I will keep u posted as he progresses. I am hopeful n just ordered a second bottle. Due to his weight, 172 lbs, i started him at half dropper twice a day. I’m gradually increasing n eventually will do maximum dose for his size.</Text>< Pictures>

I purchased this CBD oil for a gift for my friend's dog when I saw how much it has helped another's dogs. This is amazing! I've seen the mobility of two dogs improve exponentially! One poodle was facing amputation because it was so bad! He is now walking on all four legs! If you're wanting to help a senior animal or one with problems from an injury, I PROMISE this will help.

A friend recommended this product and I’m so glad I purchased it. I have seen improvements in her anxiety and 4th of July was a breeze. She no longer randomly pants and can finally settle down at night. I use the minimum dosage nearly daily and regular dosage when absolutely needed.< /Text>

Hello All,
I’m not the person who reviews anything, I actually feel bad at times because I buy 95% of my life from the internet and leave like 2% in reviews.  But I started Innovet cbd 1500mg for my 178lb rotttweiler Boss.  First he has medical issues, has had a full hip replacement on his right side at 1yr old and quite honestly could use the left side done too! He regularly has taken anti inflammatory pills and gets glucosamine salmon oils on his food.   I started to add this into that regular daily routine not only for some pain relief but in the last year he has now become super protective of anything he deems his and shows aggression towards strangers easily.  Of course being a very large guy at 3 he can be a bit much, but I have seen changes in him within the last few weeks thanks to the cbd. We are in week 4-5 and started his second bottle. His aggression has been much better, not like he’s an angel now but even my mom said he’s different with me more calm.  I really do think it’s helping him in both aspects and I plan to continue to use this in his normal daily routine.  If your having doubts please try it, give it a few weeks and maybe you too will think idk is it working? And have someone else say to you wow your dog is different!<//review>

My dog has glaucoma. It has been a heartbreaking struggle to keep his pressures under control along with maintaining his comfort through the transition as he goes blind. I have been giving him Innovet cbd oil for a few months now and wont be without it. His pressures are fairly stable but more importantly he has his personality back as he isnt in as much pain. It's making the transition so much easier. Plus he absolutely loves it!! Thank you innovet!!<//Text>

<review>AMAZING CBD OIL!!!
One of my dogs has been suffering of weakness on his hind legs. He got to the point that he couldn’t even get up to go potty, until I did research and came across this company and saw all the wonderful reviews and decided to give it a try, it was the best decision ever. I ordered the PURCBD oil 750 mg and after giving him the oil for 4-5 days he stopped limping and gained strength on his hind legs. But now I feel so bad because he ran out of the oil and after a week without the oil he started limping and having difficulties getting up again. I ordered the oil yesterday again and can’t wait to start giving him the oil again so he can start being himself again. This product is a blessing!!!</review>< pictures>

I like that the product is organic & less expensive than what u can get at local pet stores. My poodle is about 18 Y.o,keeps fairly mobile on Innova CBD Oil. Still has some anxiety  I'm not sure whether to increase his doseage, currently takes 2 drops, 2x/day of 259mg. He seems more alert than b4 taking CBD & in less pain from arthritis.</review>

My dog has been on their CBD oil product for over a year now, and I have recommended this amazing product to other pet parents whose animals are experiencing issues with old age, seizures, cancer, arthritis, etc.  It is amazing stuff.  It has completely eliminated my 17 year old dog's seizures for a year now.</Review>

Oscar (13 y.o. Lab) has been on the CBD oil for about 2 months now.  There is some improvement in mobility, but it is inconsistent.  I am now trying some herb supplements in conjunction with the oil.  I REALLY like the oil's efficacy for panting.  The results are almost immediate.  I am thinking of upping the MGs... we are using the 125 mg now... to see if that might improve mobility better.<//review>

<Review>My 4 year old pitbull sprained his knee. He didn't want to move and was very lethargic. I gave the CBD oil a try. The next day I could see the difference. Now we are at the point where we have to force him to rest because he wants to run all over the place since he's feeling better. I also see he eats more as well. We usually have to stand over him and encourage him to eat by throwing some cheese on his food. He is now eating about half of his bowl with no cheese or encouragement. I'm really pleased with my purchase.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>I just started using the CBD oil for my 13 year old dog that has arthritis in her hind legs and hips. I tried joint medications and pain medications and nothing helped. Although she is still limping a little she has been getting better on the CBD oil. I am going to keep using it and hope it gets even better!

Oh and the customer service is FANTASTIC!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2caa8c04c78dd:0xbfee1eae430a75ca< /gmap_id>< Date>

Terrible customer service.  I have been trying to resolve a simple $5 return since Nov 7.  I have made contact via email, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, 2 telephone voicemails, and they have refused to respond. Pathetic.  All to avoid refunding me $5 for a useless syringe that is still in its original package. The cat I had bought it for died.  The order had been placed 9/28. The syringes got to me a few days later, early October, so despite being strictly past 30 days of the order date on Nov 7 when I asked about returning the unused one, I figured I had some wiggle room on the delivery date, and it wasn't a big amount of money. But I couldn't get a straight answer, or any answer.  All to to avoid crediting me 5 lousy bucks.</text>

Product had a lot of awesome reviews. We got the CBD oil for a family member’s dog that was having seizures.
The advertised product online showed less than 0.01% THC, but the bottle shipped actually shows < 0.2%.

The dog was given a small dosage and immediately started throwing up. Kind of shocked to see the CBD oil giving an adverse reaction. Dog had to go to the vet twice for anti-nausea medication.
Response from the company was to just return the product.< /text>

Great service, great product.
The CBD oil has made such a difference in the life of my 105lb 9&1/2 year old Great Pyrenees mix. It literally has taken years off of him in Terms of activity level and happinesses. He has severe elbow dysplasia and he is going up and down stairs again, jumping and sleeping in bed, playing fetch and just all around happy.</Review>

I don't know what I would do without the CBD from Innovet Pet - My dog suffers from severe anxiety and was recently diagnosed with degenerative myelopathy. She hates all kinds of medicine but gobbles down her treats with the oil on it because it makes her relaxed and feel better. I cannot say enough great things about the product.< /text>

I bought this for my 13 year old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever who has displayed some major arthritis in his hind the last 6 months,  I have noticed a tremendous improvement in his mobility since starting him on Pur CBD.  His willingness to tackle stairs and his morning rituals are much improved.  I also started taking it for my shoulder which hurts all the time from an upper humorous multiple bone fracture and the aching pain that is constantly there is now gone...  Figured...good enough for my old guy, then good enough for me!!<//Text>

I ordered CBD oil for my little chihuahua Chiquita who has several seizures per day before I started her on it. The first bottle was purchased at the vitamin store for 50.00 and worked well, but it was a small bottle and since starting I have gotten it at different places and some worked better than others.  I found this company and ordered it and amazing results! The price was half of the others and I feel it works better and I know it has to do with quality, htc amounts etc. (which I don’t always understand) I
am impressed with Innovet Pet Priducts and staying with them!<//review>

I bought this product because a friend of mine is using it on his dog who had seizures too (it’s being 2 years since the last one), my dog in on phenobarbital since last year, so im giving him sometime to get use to it before taking the Pheno off. Right now he likes it and he’s been more active!<//review>

With no positive results from our vet to help our puppy with her injury it was recommended that we use CBD oil, after some research we decided to go with these fine folks and we just ordered another supply of oil drops.. No side effects and actual healing makes this a win win for us and our puppy, TYTY<//review>

<Text>Decided to give CBD oil a try for my 13 yr old lab.  She is terrified of loud noises, especially fireworks.  Started with 125mg 60 drops twice a day and it was amazing!  My dog was calm and relaxed through all the 4th of July fireworks.  I would definitely recommend giving this a try if your dog suffers from anxiety.  I started out with a minimal dose and it worked for my dog.  So happy to have found something that works.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I opted to stop giving his prescription due to worries with it being an immunosuppressant. (seek vet advice before stopping medication). I give him a natural supplement and cbd oil and it works wonders! Two of my three dogs use this an it had made a tremendous difference for them both and been just as help on my pockets.

We started giving her Innovet CBD oil before each storm, and now shes very calm and relaxed.

<Review>I use Innovet 250mg CBD oil with my 10 year old heeler mix. She works hard and plays hard and it's caught up with her back legs and hips which get sore and painful. She gets a dose of oil in her dinner everyday and an extra dose if we go for a romp. It has made the world of difference in how she moves around and how quickly she recovers. She'll be on this product for the rest of her life. Great quality, decent price!<//Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
I bought this for my dog's anxiety issues. After 2 bottles and the maximum dose, it didn't help with that but she also has a stomach problem. She vomits frequently and doesn't feel well often. Now that she's off of the CBD oil, she's back to not feeling so well. She's vomited a few times and just isn't acting herself.

I think I'll buy more just for the help with the stomach issues. Too bad it didn't help with her anxiety.</Review>

Innovet pet products provides  absolutely horrible customer service. They never answer the phone. If they finally do return a call, they leave no contact information or ext. The CBD oil for my elderly dog has been completely ineffective, even at the highest dose.  It's clear they don't stand behind their products because they offer the worst possible customer service. Avoid this company.<//Review>

I had heard a lot of good things about CBD oil so I decided to try it before resorting to pain medication to help ease his pain. It took a week or 2 to notice results but he is more playful and acts like he feels better all around! He walks a lot better also. He used to growl if you would touch certain areas due to the pain and he no longer does that except on occasion. I am definitely happy with the results and so is Chase!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Let me start by saying Im not one to EVER write a review.. But I think this product deserves it.
Initially I did not write a review until I was satisfied with the product.... I bought the CBD oil for my anxious 7-8 year old furr baby 'Pancakes'- But the main reason was to help her with her terrifying ( for me) seizures. I bought the oil in time for ANOTHER house move which always seemed to trigger separation anxiety, to my amazement absolutely no separation anxiety detected after 1-2 days... Previously I took weeks off work and even had a dog psychologist to help with her issues. Through administering the correct doses I found her transition into our new home as smooth as possible. Moving onto the main issue, Seizures... Less than 4 hours ago my baby started to seize - I stayed as calm as possible and gave her the required dose ( possibly a little more than prescribed) to me ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF her seizer stopped within moments.. Normally she has a reoccurring episodes moments after each other.. It has been 4 hours and NOTHING has happened. I CANT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE. She is my life. I feel at peace. She seems much more relaxed after the episode ( and so do I thank god!) sending sooooo much love to the INNOVET TEAM!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Love this CBD oil and Innovet Pet is fantastic!  Started using CDB oil a little over a year ago for my 12 year old boxer. She has suffered from severe anxiety and as she is aging, has nerve pain in her back and in early stages of kidney failure. The CDB oil has been a blessing for her. She is noticeably more calm, has fewer episodes of falling down (due to the nerve issues in her back) and has been able to lessen the side effects of kidney failure. I definitely recommend this product and company to anyone who has an animal experiencing anxiety or for pain relief.</text>

I discovered Innovet Pet's PurCBD+ a few months ago when my 13 year-old bichon was suffering from spinal arthritis. I wanted to get him off the prednisolone. I searched for a high quality CBD oil and stumbled across these products. It was the best thing that could have happened! I ordered the CBD and within one week of giving it to him, he was walking almost totally normally. I have two other bichons nearly the same age. One is very anxious and hyper. The other is diabetic. I started giving them the oil as well. The anxious one is MUCH calmer now and sleeps all night (he used to get up multiple times a night and disrupt everyone's sleep). The diabetic is now a very well-regulated diabetic and the mobility for all three is dramatically improved. I am beyond ecstatic! I am now ordering the hemp treats after getting a sample with my last oil order. My dogs LOVED the sample! I am thrilled to be able to add this to their regimen. Thank you Innovet Pet!!< /Text>

<text>I love the product. I was iffy at first on if it would actually work or not and I was proven that it did. My older boxer who is 8 has arthritis and torn acl from being a puppy and now she has days where she cant hardly walk. With this it has helped her a lot where we dont have to give her the pain pills as much. I will be ordering this product again.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>I'm using this for my 2 older dogs. A 14 year old Dalmatian with bulging discs in his back and some neurological loss in his back end. We found out he also has cancer in his lung and is inoperable. The CBD capsules has helped his mobility and enthusiasm to walk more. He had refused to go on walks but is surprising us lately with some longer walks. It's also part of his cancer treatment. Our other dog is a 13 1/2 year old Dalmatian/Lab mix. She had injured her ACL on her left back leg about 2 years ago and we were able to treat it without surgery. She does have a lot of scar tissue in that area and it had slowed her down some. Putting her on the CBD capsules has helped her. She runs around and plays Frisbee like she never had an injury. It has increased her activity level for sure. Now I don't have to worry that she may be in pain from the arthritis in her knee.</Text>< userid>

<Text>Vet recommended buying Innovet PURCBD oil for our dog.  We have given him as instructed for two months now and see no improvement as to his anxieties.  Other than that I find that their Facebook customer service people are smug.  The first time we ordered the oil it was boxed like any other product of this nature should be whether for animals or humans.  Second order a week ago it arrived without a box and was just bubbled wrapped; thankfully it had the safety seal attached still.  When queried them via Facebook to find out why there was no box this time the person who replied just simply said they aren't doing that anymore.  No reason given just simply that was the reply.  Won't be buying from them again after that poor so-called customer service experience.  In fact, have read internet reviews since and it appears that Innovet's CBD oil isn't the best one out there anyway.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I have purchased the PurCBD oil for my 8-yr old Boxer, Boscoe a few times, and I plan to continue to reorder.  This product has definitely helped him with pain,  inflammation, and anxiety (worked  wonders during the Fourth of July fireworks season...Boscoe is NOT a fan of fireworks).  Since using the oil, I have taken Boscoe off of Tramadol, and no longer plan to give him Diazapam.  Great product! Boscoe gives it a 5-PAW review!<//text>

I have been dealing with Innovet for several weeks nin and I have to say it's been wonderful for me and my dog. From the very first contact with a question about what would be the best product for my dog to now, I have gotten so much help and great customer service too. The cbd oil and treats help my pup with anxiety and appetite issues. He is almost 13 and will continue on his regimen. Thanks Innovet!<//Text>

I highly recommend PurCBD oil for your fur babies.  Our Bailey has very aggressive cancer and the oncologist gave him only weeks to live.  We wanted our baby to be as comfortable as possible when a friend recommended CBD oil.  So I did research and found Innovet.  CBD oil may not cure the cancer but it can give our Bailey Boy a  more comfortable remaining life.  He is still swimming and having fun in the pool which is his favorite thing to do.  Thanks Innovet I will be ording more<//text>

Innovet Pet Products is a great company to order from.  Great customer service, fast shipping and the product is wonderful.  I ordered the CBD oil for my senior labrador.  Overall, his health has improved.  He gets around better and you can just tell he feels better.  He acts younger than he is.  I will continue to keep him on their CBD oils.< /review>

<text>After a ton of research, I selected the CBD Oil from Innovet for my 14 year old Springer Spaniel, who suffers badly from arthritis and Hip issues. He has a lot of trouble standing and walking. We have him on Meloxicam for the pain he is in, and I had nothing to lose by trying the CBD Oil. There has been a noticeable improvement in his mobility and demeanor after being on the oil for a couple of weeks. He is quite a bit happier, like he was years ago. I would recommend this to anyone who has an ailing older dog. You have nothing to lose...</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Their CBD oil works wonders. My dog was having a lot of problems with her arthritis. She's a 10 year old lab. She already takes a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement and I've got her on a raw diet, but those weren't doing the trick. She used to just lie there in so much pain. She didnt want to go out and definitely didnt want to play. After even just the first dose of this CBD oil, she is so much more active and happy again. I give 15 drops 2x/day. Now she's running and playing. I'm so happy. I'll definitely be a repeat customer.< /Text>

<Review>I have been purchasing from Innovet for 1.5 years. Their customer service and products are the best. Fast shipping, fair prices and top notch products.
I have 3 dogs that use PurCBD for 3 different reasons. The oldest is almost 14 and has cancerous tumors, the CBD gives him some relief from discomfort and keeps his appetite healthy. The second oldest is almost 13 and the CBD helps keep her active and comfortable while having some arthritis in her hips. Using this I was able to get her off of her prescription pain management routine.The vet even mentioned a couple of weeks ago how amazed she was with how playful she still was at her age. The youngest just turned 3 and it helps relieve his separation anxiety. I’ve been using PURCBD for 1.5 years and it is amazing. I’ve even got family and friends using it for their dogs!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Our dog Murphy suffers from uncontrollable seizures.  We were giving the CBD oil as needed along with his prescription medications.  He recently went into a massive cluster of seizures at which point I decided to add the CBD oil daily along with his meds.  He is now taking the drops 3-4 times daily along with his other meds and so far he’s had 30 whole days with no issues.  He also suffers from severe anxiety and the CBD really calms him down and helps him cope.<//Text>

<Text>Really authentic El Salvadoran cuisine, you absolutely want to have pupusas here. Whether you choose the zucchini pupusas or the pork & cheese or bean & cheese (or all of them!) they're made fresh to order and served with a side of cabbage salad. The price can't be beat. And the retro look of the restaurant is just awesome -- so much to see and experience while dining here!<//Text>< Pictures>

Decent pupusa and salsa. I was not a big fan of their tamales though.

Update: their Sopa de papa ( Salvadoran version of menudo) was super good- must try if you are into tripe soup!</text>

<Review>CASH ONLY!   Anytime we're in the area (San Bruno Ave) this is a must stop for some pupusas.  The only other thing I've tried on the menu is especial (fried) chicken wings which are decent. Pupusas are the family fave (chicken and cheese).  Super reasonable prices too.<//Review>< Pictures>

This is a great spot to eat Salvadoran food. Clean tables, nice and polite workers, usually the owner welcomes you, and always have a smile for you. Price is right
Menu with a lot of options. Mini bar with a few selection of beers. Sports playing on the TVs make you enjoy more of the food</review>

<review>This place is great!  Where in SF can you get a light meal for $3.00 plus tax and tip?  No where.  Comes with cabbage and the pupusa had cheese and pork mixed inside !  Was very good. Also came with salsa and chips.  (One pupusa and cabbage, +chips)
A real find!< /review>< rate>

<Text>Went there for the first time the servers are moody. I ordered take out. Then they were charging me 2x what my  order was. The server was insisting that is what I ordered so I asked for the menu again. My bill was supposedley $16.00 not $24.00. So as it turned out she was giving someone elses' check. I got home excited to eat my yuca con chicharon fritas. 4 small pieces of chicharones and 4 pieces of yuca. My 2 pupsas are ok. But what killed me was the vegetable cortido no tastes and half way my food found 2 curly hair I hate to imagine where they came from. Sums it to say not going there anymore. 😒😒😒😒< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The place hot and no fans.
The server doesn't understand English, and he messed up our order.
My sister ordered two tamales, and the server decided he only wanted to give her one even though the menu said two per order.
I ordered a banana shake, and he decided to add berries to my banana shake. If you are in customer service, please be able to speak English as well, especially in a restaurant setting.< /review>< Response>

Love their breakfast plate, which comes with scramble eggs (you should ask for Salvadoran style which comes with veggies) refried beans, fried plantains and hand made tortillas, and you can get it at any time day or night. I also like their fried corn tamale. Their pupusas are ok and I usually order cheese with zucchini. I come here from time to time cause they close until 11pm which is rear for a Salvadoran restaurant to close that late. The place is at times way too loud cause their music takes over the whole place and to have a conversation you need to be louder than usual. Also the place is not as dirty but their bathroom I will use only for emergencies. The area is parking meter only, but since I usually go in the night is free.</Text>

Friendly, unpretentious place to fill your belly with delicious Salvadorian pupusas, platanos, frijoles and fried cheese (of "friend" cheese as the menu says) while watching the fútbol.< /text>

I love coming to this coffee shop on Fridays after a long week at work and getting the iced vanilla latte. It is my go-to here. I love the aesthetics but also the workers here - they are really nice and inviting. The price is right for a good iced latte and they roast their own beans.

<review>If you like actual milk in your coffee, don't set foot here. While this places has great asthetic(and an awesome name/logo), I just don't know how you can be a full service coffee shop without offering dairy milk as an option. A latte or cappuccino without that creamy addition just isn't the same.

Even knowing this, I still thought I would give it a try, and ordered an iced latte. Although the price is actually quite reasonable, upon my first sip, I was instantly disappointed with the plant milk flavor that soured my latte. Nothing against people who like plant milk, or who are vegetarian/lactose intolerant, but I just don't understand why regular milk can't even be an option. At any rate, if you like your coffee with anything except almond, oat or soy milk, don't even waste your time here.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWQPdwlHyVc2JUkpokKnm_QO78UGRIG65NNDcg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>BEST COFFEE. BEST SERVICE. BEST PEOPLE. I have been a fan of Tired Eyes every since they opened and this review is long overdue. From the most delicious beans to the most delicious drinks to the friendliest staff, Tired Eyes is by far my favorite coffee shop in San Diego. I recently placed an online order that I sadly got lost in the mail and Tyler’s service was above and beyond. He not only replaced the order but gave me an extra bag of beans and refunded me the entire order!!! That’s service!!!! Please give this coffee shop your money you will not regret it!!!!! Thank you to everyone at Tired Eyes for all they do :) y’all are such an integral part of our community.<//Review><Date>1616266841149</Date>< username>

<Text>The baker latte is a must try! The vegan donuts are also amazing. I love how they only have oat and almond milk. Excellent customer service, this may be my new addiction</Text>< pictures>

Needed to waste time while waiting for our breakfast reservations.  This was a happy accident.  Out of all the coffee shops we visited, this was my favorite. Wanted to go again but they are closed on Mondays. Simple quick service.<//Review>

<Review>This cozy little shop is my go-to for lattes. They only have dairy-free options which makes my lactose-intolerant little heart sing. Too many times I have gotten sick from other shops that forget to use oat milk in my drink. The best part is their prices are so fair. My husband loves the cold brew and the pour over.< /Review><GmapID>0x80d9531f215a2a17:0x9d60c0f1f95ff2bf</GmapID>< Pictures>

For me, a perfect shop. Tiny and limited offerings but they roast their own beans, from quality single origin growers, and they do it beautifully. Really good.< /Review>

Coffee is okay on a good day. If you have a job or patience in San Diego I would highly recommend avoiding this place. They took 45 minutes for an ice coffee and ice water.< /review>

Small shop but the coffee is on point. They definitely meet my standards for craft coffee and their beans did well in my chemex. Support small local shops - let's make sure they exist after Covid!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>4 stars for the coffee and experience. It’s a small shop but really well done stylistically. The beans are great and roasted by them. The only thing to note is they ONLY serve oat milk and almond milk. So be prepared for that.

1 additional star for BRANDING! I’ve never gone to a coffee shop and wanted to buy merch before but goodness their logo and branding is on point. I wanted the coffee mug and one of the 4 design t-shirts. Sadly they didn’t have my size, but I had to give an extra star because good branding can’t go unnoticed! I’ll definitely be coming back.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Dairy-free
This is a great spot for coffee if you are dairy free!  All of the coffee is made on either oat milk or almond milk.  We didn't realise this we drank it - to us it tasted odd because we are used to drinking coffee with cow's milk!< /Text>< Rating>

<review>These guys roast their own beans and keep it real simple. Oat or Almond milk are your only two options but I don't mind as I love the Oatly brand milk with my coffee. Their Cool Beans blend is what I've had both times I've been here. A bright blend that has my beloved Ethiopian bean in it. Coffee is prepared well and I can always taste the notes. Parking is metered but I've gotten a spot both times I've come down here during the week in the middle of the day. The owner is passionate about the craft and for the 3rd wave coffee lover, you won't be disappointed here!<//review>< response>

I ordered the Cool Beans and In Bloom blends and had delivered a couple days later to Colorado.  Very delicious!  I brewed both of them using an aero press, French press, and drip (technivorm moccamaster).  So cool to watch this company grow the past couple years.  Congrats on your success Tired Eyes!  You’re an inspiration to us other roasters that might try our own venture.</text>

<Text>Excellent well balanced espresso, and by extension fresh roasted beans. Roasted coffee has roast dates, which is important and becoming gradually less common with certain local roasters. My only minor gripe is that I would like to see the espresso served with demitasse spoons.<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I love a simple and delicious coffee. This spot offers a nice light roast that has a clean taste and gives a perfect lil perk. I walk a half a mile from my office, passing by prob 5 other coffee shops, just to get here. Thankful for a chill place that serves bomb coffee in the downtown area. Prices are even a dollar or so lower than the other shops (which does NOT reflect a lower quality, ok.. use that extra dollar to tip your barista :)). Stop by and support your local coffee roaster! Tired Eyes Coffee rules.<//Review>

This was the best dental visit I have ever had!!!!  I am terrified to go to the dentist because of past dental traumas. I shared my fears and concerns with Dr. Propes and his staff on my initial consult/exam visit. Today's visit, when the actual dental work was done was outstanding.  I can't say I enjoyed the visit - because after all  it was the dentist you know - but I can tell you that it was a very nice experience. I would recommend Dr. Propes and his staff very highly! I will also return again for my regular dental maintenance exams.</text>

Excellent.  Broke a tooth during dinner last night (6/20), called this morning, appointment set, have a hunch you worked me in somehow.  Met Jose for the first time and he is terrific. I was home again 2 & 1/2 hours later with a temp and scheduled back in a few weeks. Keep up the great work.<//review>

I have been a patient with Dr. Propes since he started his practice.  My husband became his patient when we got married.  We have had nothing but great experiences with this office.  My husband recently required extensive dental work (implants and dental appliances) after years of working on his oral health and trying everything else.  This office has worked really hard with the oral surgeon, dental lab and picky wife to make this a success.  Dr. Propes and his staff have really gone the extra mile to make sure that everything is right for my husband. While this has not been easy, even in the middle of Covid, we have felt safe and been well cared for in this office.  We HIGHLY recommend this dental office.< /Review>

<time>1576079409597< /time><review>Dr. Propes and his staff are always so friendly and comforting during any visit I have had. Any time I have called with questions Liz has always been very courteous and helpful. I will not go any other dentist and will continue to refer Dr. Propes to all my family and friends. I must add Jessica, dental hygenist is pretty awesome my teeth always feel amazing when she is done. I also.must add, I don't care much for getting injections, I don't anyone does, but I have no problem with Dr. Propes or Jennifer giving me one, I could not feel the injection at all, I was very impressed!! Dr. Propes you and your team ROCK!!</review></record>

Dr. Propes and his staff are professional, efficient, and compassionate. Because they understand the anxiety people feel about dental treatment, they go above and beyond to help patients feel comfortable. It is not an exaggeration when I say I enjoy going to my dentist's office.<//review>

<Review>Dr. Propes is amazing. He’s been my dentist for a while now, and has always said he treats his patients like family. Well, today he proved it. My two boys (3 and 5) collided, and my five year olds front tooth was not looking good. He was in pain and I didn’t quite know what to do. I called Dr. Propes, and he said he’d stay after hours to work on my kiddo.

When we got there it was just him and his assistant, and they were about as friendly as could be. They did a fantastic job explaining to my son everything that was going on, in a way a five year old could understand. After the amazing care Dr. Propes has given my family, I will be actively recommending him to friends and family. Thanks again Dr Propes!<//Review><response>{'time': 1572281912266, 'text': 'Hi Josh!

Great doctor. I am a fellow periodontist in town, and have had the pleasure of having my staff and myself receive great work from Dr. Propes. He is great at diagnosing your problems, great treatment planner, great bedside manner, and great work! I send patients to him regularly for esthetic work as well, and to restore our dental implants. It is my privilege to work with Dr. Prope’s Office.< /text>

<text>Very rude receptionist, was recommended through my dentist who is out of town. Receptionist Didn’t attempt to help a customer in discomfort, or have any understanding of the situation, there were many things that could have been done in her part to achieve a simple solution. Her simple solution was to hang up.< /text>< pictures>

{'time': 1528997096011, 'text': 'Hi Kelly.  I am very sorry to hear that you were not handled well on the phone by our front office.  Customer service is our number one priority... In reviewing your call with my receptionist, you were in pain and were requesting an antibiotic and a pain reliever.  My office staff offered you several appointment times that did not work for you.  In fact, you simply wanted medication called in, but refused to be seen.  We cannot legally call in medications unless it is "for a patient of record" according to the Dental Board of California.  For that reason, my staff attempted, in vain, to work you into our schedule, but apparently those time slots were not convenient for you.  In fact, YOU hung up on my receptionist.  You stated that there were "many things that could have been done to achieve a simple solution."  In my opinion, all of those things start with an appointment and a dental examination. Calling in medications for a patient without examining them is actually illegal in the state of California. I am a proud member of the Yosemite Dental Society, the California Dental Association, and the American Dental Association. I run a respectable and ethical dental practice. In this case, I support my receptionist\'s actions.  Best of luck to you. -Dr. Propes'}</response>

My daughter loves it. Been here twice in the past week. Such a fun space for the toddlers.  I love that the fee is for the child only, & parents are allowed to accompany their kid.< /review>

<rate>3</rate><Review>Fun place but not up to par for today's standards. I used to take my eldest son here 10 years ago & it was a good time for really young kids, good for a couple hours or so. And I'm sure it still is. It hasn't changed at all in 10 years. I took my 5 year old here & he had fun but after playing for about 1.5 hours he was willing to leave. I asked him if he liked it & he said it was fun but there wasn't very much to do. I think the problem was not only the amount of things to do but the length of time it could keep his interest. There is a place in Lakeside called Funbelievable & Child's Play would be doing themselves a favor if they converted to something similar to that. My kids will play at Funbelievable for the whole day. Conclusion: this place is good for 1-3 ( maybe 4) years old & any older it's not quite worth it.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjYnq3VbDbJhYUXxaUj3sNUQRI9f5CSmZd7rEh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyyd-5d_5n_m0sskbWMNtjjHBv1jmFtTkLEYJL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtWE5S6odRLtFG98PAMBUot7VVqfBnPtgWdZ06=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>I had my son's first birthday here. We had a good time. My son and the other kids enjoyed it. They had everything nicely set up with the decor and table settings I gave them. The bubble time was a nice touch. Kinda pricey to book for just two hours but it was worth it.<//review></record>

Have had 2 of my boys 1st birthday parties here and was so happy each time. The owner is super friendly and helpful. Get the whole place to yourself, and they play cute games with kids, play music, movie, set up and decorate, clean up, everything so you get to enjoy your party and guests. It's awesome. Also, open play time is great too. It's always clean in there and fun toys for ages crawling to about 5 or 6.<//text>

I do have a suggestion about their ventilation, a lot of times the place smells, either food people bring in or urine, other than that its nice. Safe,clean and fun for little ones. Its pretty inexpensive too<//text><response>None<//response>< user>

<Response>None<//Response><text>We love Child's Play. We have gone regularly since my son was 1 year old. The owner does her best to provide a clean, fun, safe playing environment for our children. It bothers me that someone gave a bad review based on how other children were acting! It is up to us parents to control our children's actions and ensure that they are using things in the proper manner. This is not a daycare facility and it isn't the owners job to watch your kids while you socialize!!<//text><user_name>Paulette<//user_name><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x80db7f95dd024141:0xdf666bf539c0749b<//gmapID><user_id>104236139243033378479< /user_id>< Time>

A great place to take toddlers. This place is better suited for 2-4 year olds due to its younger aged toys. Its more calm here than play rooms for slightly older kids. The management is warm and welcoming.</text>

<Review>Love love love this place. Aside from there being limited parking on some occasions, this place offers a clean, safe environment for my young daughter to socialize and play independently. After the fist visit I was hooked and reserved the space for my daughters birthday celebration. I can't wait :)<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Great place to bring your kids to play. There are a variety of toys for children of different ages. Everything is clean and I have noticed that they disinfect and wipe down areas which is also a plus.< /Review>< user_id>

Awesome place to take your kids, it's free until their 10 months old then it's $9 a visit or you can do a monthly plan and it's about 15 to 20 dollars a month. If you have a lot of kids it can get expensive but it's well worth it. The facilities are very clean and have toys for all ages. It is a bit small and can get busy on certain days but over all it's well worth it to allow the kids to interact with each other. It's not a daycare for anyone who wants to. know, adults go in with kids and play with them.</Review>

<username>LuigiFan135< /username><Date>1500569153593< /Date><review>I would give this place 0 stars . The owner is completely 2 faced and could care less if kids get too rough. My 2 youngest have been hit and pushed many times at this place and she could care less. She is nice to your face but as soon as you turn around it's a different story . So if you're big on liars and having your kids bullied this is a perfect place .< /review>< user>

I'm giving this restaurant five stars because it's one of my family favorite places to eat chicken it comes with beans rice salsa and tortillas corn or flour salad macaroni or potato.
It's 2 combo meals for $16.99</review>

Love the chicken! You can smell it a mile away. Oscar is very courteous. Provides excellent service. Chicken does sell fast so it is best to preorder for your parties.<//text>

This place makes the best Chicharrón in town! Prices are very good. Tip, on weekends they make mesquite grilled chicken, it is the best! Highly recommend it.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) THE MEXICAN BREAD THAT THEY SELL IS OLD BREAD ON SUNDAY I BUY BREAD AND IT WAS HARD. THEY SHOULD THROW THAT BREAD. DO NOT HAVE IT THERE FOR SALE. WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT IN THIS KIND OF PEOPLE. That they charge you even THE AIR WHEN YOU ENTER THAT MARKET. I do not recommend this business 🗑

EL PAN MEXICANO QUE VENDEN ES PAN VIEJO EL DOMINGO COMPRE PAN Y ESTABA DURO. DEBERÍAN DE TIRAR ESE PAN. NO TENERLO AHÍ A LA VENTA.  QUE SE PUEDE ESPERAR EN ESTE TIPO DE GENTE.  Que te cobran hasta EL AIRE AL ENTRAR A ESA MARKET.  No recomiendo este negocio 🗑<//Review>< date>

First time back in several years but the proprietor still has a memory an elephant would envy. And, despite COVID the experience is truly wonderful.
Was just going to savor a wonderful cup of coffee but the aromas enticed me to get an order of Hong Kong Egg Waffle as well.< /review>

Old school cafe. Little grimy and rustic inside. Pandan coconut iced latte sweet. Try the durian egg waffle and iced Vietnamese golden egg coffee<//text>

<review>Loved the pandan coconut coffee and pandan mochi egg puff!

The mango smoothie was decent - you can taste the fresh fruit.

The Hanoi Insanity Coffee (golden egg coffee) was just okay to me. It was served extra hot, and a tad too bitter. It tasted better once it cooled down.

I will come back to try the iced durian coffee!<//review>< date>

Fresh roast is super close to my work. Always been wanting to stop by for their famous egg waffles and coffee. I was the first customer this morning at 8 am! Lol. Uncle Jimmy welcomed me and took my order. I ordered the Pandan Egg waffles with mochi. You do have the option to add mochi or without it.  It came out hot and crispy, soooooo delicious, tho can actually tastes the warm mochi and Pandan. I literally finished the entire waffle within 10 mins. I KNOW!
They also have a selection of breakfast and coffee menu. You can order your waffles in different flavors. The sandwiches looked very mouthwatering. Probably gonna be on my list for my next visit.
Service is good and quick. The atmosphere and set up  is very homey. Unfortunately, won't be able to dine in due to COVID.</review>

<userid>118334970291080532783</userid><text>Came at 9pm on a Saturday night. Had two other parties there, so not too busy. Got the egg coffee for $5. I've had egg coffee before in Vietnam and it was very frothy. This version is less frothy and you can't really taste the egg. I think the top may have been food coloring (I could be wrong!) but the coffee was still good. Was very strong caffeine wise. The egg waffle and ice cream was delicious. We got the green tea and chocolate. I definitely recommend with the ice cream. Goes good with the coffee which isn't too sweet. The setting itself is definitely a little worn in and disorganized. Menu items are also random. We wanted to pay but the man told us we pay when we leave. Overall, waffles are good coffee is strong. Good snack, not the cleanest, cozy.</text>< Date>

<text>This is a family friendly place. Delicious food prepared fresh as you order. Their menu is amazing. My daughter and I stopped there for breakfast and it was very tasty. The place is clean well lit and it has plenty of tables inside and out in the front. I'm not sure if the have parking in the back but there was parking available on the main Street.<//text>< pics>

Strong strong coffee and Americano. Lots of seating and variety of food from Taiwanese, Vietnamese to regular American cafe. $5minimum spend to use credit card with charge of $0.50 if it is under $15. Good for working on laptop, studying with outlets inside. Free limited parking lot. Super nice mom pop shop -- speak English and Mandarin.

Popcorn chicken is more like a meal, larger chunks compare to tiny ones at Taiwanese cafe.< /Text>

Fresh Roast is a small quirky vietnamese french corner coffee shop off E. Broadway and San Gabriel Blvd on SGValley. They offer house-roasted coffee, sandwiches, smoothies, juices, HK style egg waffles, chicken wings and noodle soup. Indoor and outdoor seats were spacious, organized and well lit. Indoor vibe is welcoming and relaxing. Interior decor is filled with books, toys, memorabilia, old car plates, assorted old souvenir collections, wooden bird clocks, etc. We came here on a lazy Sunday morning breakfast. We ordered their fresh baked Croissant (ham with lettuce, egg, avocado and tomatoes) sandwich, eggwaffle and coffee. Coffee blend was  average taste. Croissant sandwich and eggwaffle was soft, tasty and fresh. Service was moderately fast. Staff were nice, competent and professional. Prices were reasonable and competitive. Free Wi-Fi (pwd required) available. Ample of street parking and back rear parking lot available.  Overall we had a good dining experience and breakfast meal. We recommend this coffee shop.</review>

It's an interesting little place. Some of the "decorations" looks like they have price tags on them and so they might be for sale. I got the Vietnamese Coffee which was ok a little on the bitter side for my taste. Wife got the Chai Tea Latte which she really liked. It's a little on the cluttered side and on the way out I seen that they had a "B" rating which makes me wonder.<//review>

<Text>Unique coffee house with excellent egg waffles and snacks! Many unique coffee beans from all over the world are roasted on site and available by the pound. The serious draw is the HK style egg waffle, which comes in many flavors. They are crunchy on the outside yet chewy on the inside. Perfectly done and comparable to the best waffle in HK.
Free street parking, cash only (50 cents surcharge under $5)<//Text>< Response>

<text>I only tried the egg waffle and it tastes amazing. It’s crispy and you mustn’t skip out on the filling. The filling makes the experience so many times better.  The chocolate flavor is the very best. You have to go try it for yourself.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2dadda48bc77f:0x319962b282b70ff1< /gmapID><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkGvvv0-kH1NKi3hs-JAh3KoAPq2n9Mq9AxHQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

Food and drinks are decent. Got the Hong kong waffle and the Durian coffee and both were really delicious. I find the place a bit cramped though.

I stumbled upon this place when I was trying to find a nice place to sit and study. But most of the boba shops I normally go to does not open until 11 am so I ended up here since it opens on 7:30 am. I disliked how they have a 2 hour limit compared to other coffee/tea shops in which I can study for hours. I also found the place to be a bit too dim.<//text>

Lovely locally owned small coffee shop that smells, feels and tastes old school. Very charming and unpretentious. Hand poured over ground coffee beans and various hkg style deserts, you come in and cant help but want to sit awhile.</review>

Found this place via yelp and was surprised they have an array of durian flavored items. We def had to try the durian coffee which was quite strong and has durian chunks in the bottom. We also had the durian egg waffle which was very tasty and has soft chewy durian morsels in each puff. The owner was quite nice and recommended us to try other durian flavored things but we were too full. There’s seating inside and outside. Gotta try the tofu pudding with durian next time!< /review>

<text>After visiting a few spots near Alhambra I found myself returning to this nice place. The folks running place were kind and courteous each time. The food was tasty and the portions are great. The coffee was what brought me back tho. Espresso was flavorful and aromatic, and the Ethiopian roast they had was just as satisfying. I look forward to coming back.<//text>< user>

Went to a Lunar Festival a few weeks ago and got a mochi hong kong waffle at a stand and was craving more.

I searched on Yelp and saw that this place was cheaper and had more flavors. We ordered a matcha flavor with chocolate filling and a regular mochi one. Out of the two, my bf and I liked the mochi one better, but I felt like we should have just ordered one to share because I felt like I was getting a headache from all the sugar I was eating.

If I was ever feeling Hong Kong Waffles again, I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other flavors.< /review>

There's a small outside patio to sit outside that's covered with plants. My favorite thing is the Hanoi Insanity coffee which comes hot or iced and has a creamy foam top made of egg whip. They also have a a lot of sandwiches to choose from made with Belgium or bubble waffles . Definitely coming back to try their wide variety of coffees!

The only parking I know of is on the street but this place is definitely worth the stop.<//Text><Date>1550377373909<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

I usually come in get some vietnamese coffee to go prior to going to class, so this time I came in and actually had time to hang out and chill inside. We ordered Mango, coconut milk with sticky rice, a matcha waffle with Nutella, Thai milk tea, and the golden egg coffee unsweetened.
I really enjoy this place there's book available to read while your here, the staff is so friendly and nice, I felt like I was visiting relatives with how they treated us.
Great place I recommend stopping by.<//review>

I'm just gonna call this a 5 stars night, because all the new places that I visited on this Friday Night are all going to get 5 stars from me. Heading into Fresh Roast, I was overcome with hospitality, friendly service, and satisfying coffee.

A small family-run coffee shop like this one might not be for everyone, but I suggest trying Fresh Roast at least once to experience a place that cares about their customers and coffee made with gusto. This place was supposed to be closing, but when I popped my head in to ask, I received a friendly "Of course, open for you!"

-=- Coffee Lover -=- This was the recommended coffee to get. It was sweet and had a light caramel flavor. It was not too caramel-y or too anything for that matter. It was like a smooth blend of all the sweet coffees.

-=- Waffle Bites -=- We didn't even order this, but the owner came by and said that we should try it. So awesome and so friendly. They were on the plain side, but that's what I like. These go down pretty light, so it could get dangerous if you are trying to avoid eating too much.<//Text>

However stars are deducted because when we went to pay we were overcharged about $20. There were seven of us and our order was scattered among many different items but $20 over charge is no excuse. If you do go make sure you check your receipt thoroughly</text>< Time>

<review>High quality coffee. I always ask Jimmy if I can try a new coffee sample and he always makes me a fresh sample coffee. Try the sumatra plain then with milk and sugar. Kenya is delicious on its own plain. His house blend is not too bad. Colombian is good as well, stronger than most. Very good place to buy coffee per pound. He has his own machine and always brews fresh roasts. I write this post as I'm waiting for another sample (Italian).< /review>< pics>

I liked their ambiance te most.  Cafe owner and his staff were friendly.  I tried their coconut coffee on ice.  I can distinctly taste both the coffee and coconut flavor but the it's not a good combo.  I couldn't even finish half.  I would like to try different drinks next time.</Review>

<text>CAUTION: DO NOT come to this place this place is totally DISGUSTING! Found a cockroach in my drink!!!!! The worst part is when I went back with the cockroach coffee, the owner refused to come out, they were very rude and acted like it's not a big deal they can't do a refund but can replace a new drink for me. Excuse me????? I DO NOT need a refund I need EXPLANATION and APOLOGY!!!!!!  The overall hygiene is horrible they wear no gloves when preparing food and drink. I am also reporting this irresponsible store to FDA. This place is a nightmare! Again, WARNING! DO NOT come to this store!<//text><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

The scenery here is pretty nice. A little disorganized, but it feels cozy to me.
I tried the infamous civet coffee here before, tbh wouldn't recommend it, but it is called cat poop coffee sooo... Anyways, the waffles here are good. Several flavors are available.</text>

My go to place to get Vietnamese iced coffee. Their coffee to condensed milk ratio is perfect. It's small and dark, so not the most ideal place to do work. I usually just grab the coffee and go. Parking is in the back.< /Text>

They do not except credit cards under $5 purchase. And I believe the owner said they only allow wifi for some other minimum purchase. I am only rating low because I didn't get to try the coffee and wanted to post this so that others will know about the credit card policy.</review>

< Review>
We found Fresh Roast on Yelp. The picture of the HK waffle lured us in. We love the HK waffles. You can get plain waffle, or with fillings. We tried blueberry, chocolate and mochi. Chocolate is everyone's favorite. They also serve good coffee. The friendly owner recommended #1 Coffee Lover. It's made with espresso, milk, caramel and condense milk. Just the right amount of sweetness with the bitter taste of caramel. It was great, and perfect with the waffle. It's a comfy little place where you can relax or hang out with friends.</Review>

< review>
I wasnt a big fan after trying this place. Didn't meet my expectations of HK egg waffles. I came here on a weekend because I saw yelp had some good reviews that the waffle is really good like it's from Hong Kong so I decided to give it a try since I have been craving HK waffles and haven't had it since I moved to LA. I got the durian coffee and Green tea waffle with durian and red bean. I love durian so I decided to try anything with durian. I never had durian with coffee and never came to my mind that would go together so I decided to try it and it literally just tasted like durian with coffee. Iced coffee with pieces of durian as you drink it. The green tea waffle was not the best I have tried. I probably won't be back as I had better in NY and HK so this was just okay. Didn't have the taste or texture I was looking for. There was no fluffy or puffiness that I have tasted before. I will have to continue my hunt for good hk style waffles unfortunately.<//review>

Coffee/juices/Tea/food: 4/5 stars
They roast coffee and whole sale from here so their coffee is always fresh. They have Hawaiian, blue mountain, and even luwak coffee here.  Try the siphoned coffee for kick if you haven't. The latte is on point. The house blends beans used to be better years ago with a unique flavor but now it's more like a normal flavor but still very good latte. The HK waffle is excellent. Snacks and sandwiches are very good. Noodles are just ok.

Atmosphere: 4/5 stars
If you like eclectic old country look then you'll like it here. Mom and pop kind of place. Friendly and relaxing where you can sit for awhile and forget the traffic outside.  It could use a thorough clean up and freshen up.

Service: 5/5 stars
You can get coffee/food Togo or sit in. Friendly staffs that get to know you. Mom and pop will greet you by name so service is very personal if they are not busy. They have snacks, sandwiches, and food beside coffee and more fancy coffee.

Expense: 4/5 stars
Prices are less than your local Starbucks.

Return: 6/5 stars
I've come here for decades for coffee so that's an achievement by itself.

You can see my bias in my rating do just come and support your local mom and pop coffee shop if you don't want to see a Starbucks replacing it.<//review>

<review>For over a decade, Fresh Roast has been a popular coffee shop serving citizens of San Gabriel. It was around even before the "third-wave coffeehouse" movement began. Dating back in the late 90's and early 2000's, customers around the neighborhood came to surf the Internet at computer stations in exchange for purchasing a cup of coffee. This practice remains the same today, except customers are bringing in their own electronics, and they understand and appreciate artisan coffee much more.

Fresh Roast is one of the rare places in the San Gabriel Valley that uses a siphon to brew coffee. The siphon technique involves brewing coffee at a constant temperature, which ensures the extraction time is controlled. It yields one of the cleanest and most crisp cup of filtered coffee. Pair it with the latest roast and you have the best tasting 20oz (~2 to 3 cups) of coffee in San Gabriel.

A wide variety of single-origin coffee beans is roasted in-house by owner Jimmy. The beans are country specific, but are not sourced from specific microlots or farms like third-wave coffeeshops do. However, the beans are inexpensive at around $10 to $12 per pound except for the special Jamaican Blue Mountain Wallensford Estate ($50/lb). Third-wave coffee shops typically charge much more, in excess of $20 per pound. Jimmy seems to roast the beans a little darker than I prefer.<//review>< Date>

<review>Great Vietnamese Iced Coffee here. I make my own Caphe Sua Da at home but Fresh Roast literally fresh roasts their coffee with their in-house coffee roaster. This coffee beats anything you can brew with Cafe Du Monde or Trung Nguyen's pre-ground nonsense. I love stopping here and then I like to head to Golden Deli to get some delicious pho and egg rolls!< /review>< Rate>

Literally the worst park ever. First off, its not filled with sand or wood chips, its all leaves. The jungle gym is literally a jungle with all the bird poop and spider webs. And on top of all that, there is a GIANT FCC BROADCASTING TOWER disguised as a tree. Right next to the park. I stood 3 feet from the tower as i read a sign that said "this tower produces more radio frequency than is allowed for the public. Caution". Close it down please. My daughter keeps wanting to go cause its empty.<//text>

He’s usually a little high strung, but remained calm during the half hour treatment. And his mobility has improved with just that one treatment. I look forward to more improvements with the next 2 treatments. Bear is a sweet old man going on 17 years old. So any improvement in his health warms my heart and makes me happy. 😁🐶❤️< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Dr. Mathan and her staff have been taking care of our fur-babies since Vet Mobile days.  She and her staff are simply the best in every way; excellent care, very knowledgeable, wonderful follow up care, honest, kind, they are very sweet to your babies and very reasonable costs.  We are also extremely grateful their hospital survived the fire as they are so appreciated and a blessing to our Ridge community.  Unfortunately,  I do have to drive almost an hour to get there now but I know my pets are in the best of hands and I trust them completely.  Thank you for always taking such good care of all my critters all these years.</text>

My sweet old dog recently got extremely ill. I called and explained what was going on, they were able to get her in for a visit quickly.
The prognosis for my dog didn’t look good. They gave her an antibiotic shot and pain meds and said they wanted to see her back at the end of the week.
The dr called me every day to check on my sweet dog and see how she was doing and if we needed to get her in sooner. This gave us great peace of mind being able to talk with the dr daily and such great customer service! All of the staff here are wonderful and caring people.
When I brought my dog back at the end of the week they were so happy to see her doing better! I truly feel they saved her life by the care that was provided. I appreciate all of them greatly. Amazing vet, I highly recommend!< /Text>

<Review>I have been a customer of Dr. Dalia Mathan's for over 20 years! I live out of the Paradise area now but still continue to come back with my animals regardless of the distance. Dr. Mathan is a master at her profession and Paradise is lucky to have Dr. Mathan and her services.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< time>

<text>After being treated so rudely by Ms Mathan, hanging up the phone on me finally after not returning my call for 3 days, over a number of attempts and having NO empathy or understanding of our situation with Rontu's health and/or my surgery.
I will no longer use her/there services or would I ever refer any pet owner to them!
Thank God! I was able to see one a vet in a timely manner who cares about patients & pets.</text>< GmapID>

<review>You need to stop pretending like there is a deadly virus. It's not. 12 months ago there was every reason to be concerned, but at this point it's like a sick joke. They renamed the flu to "covid" and have destroyed small business (globally) in the process. Please, wake up, take off the masks, and let's start to recover our sense of Liberty - the only thing that unites us all in this country - while we still have a chance.<//review><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I started going to Animal hospital on the ridge in Spring of 2019. I had a sick cat and having moved here  just before the fire, I knew nothing about any of the veterinary services on the ridge. Someone referred me to Animal hospital on the ridge. We received great service then and have since been back for check ups as well as other pet related issues.
Everyone in the office is helpful, kind, professional and caring. We've had some serious ongoing issues recently with one of our dogs which has meant numerous phone calls, xrays, exams and various meds.
I will continue to trust Dr. M and her staff with our fur babies.<//Text>

I didn't want to wait thru the weekend for her to be seen and didn't want to drive all the way to Chico to the emergency vet.  AHTR was able to get me in that afternoon.  They came to the car to get her due to COVID 19. Dr Mathan examined her, ruled out any serious issues and sent her home with something for the diarrhea, vomiting and a bland diet for a couple of days.  She is already doing much better this morning (Saturday).  No diarrhea or vomiting overnight.  She seems to feel a little better, too.  Still not quite back to her energetic self yet, but I feel very confident she will be by tomorrow.<//Review></record>

< review>
Although we have had a great experience in the past with this vet, I was dumbfounded on why we were told to bring in our dog at 7:30am when they don't open until 8. I waited even though I was going to be late to work. When someone showed up, I tried to leave my dog with them and they said they will not take an animal for an appointment until 8:30. I told her we were told 7:30 drop off and she said I will have to wait. Any other vet I have been to would have taken anyone's pet even a little bit early for them. They lost my business. Hopefully no one else has this experience.< /review>

<review>Conservative clinic. Service is good, everyone friendly. Visit was fine with the exception of dog not getting vaccinations after calling once to put that on schedule and Ken also told the staff that morning to do vaccinations. After our effort to convey message dog came home without receiving vaccinations. Otherwise everything was great. Love our vet and her staff.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmap_id>

I would like to give my experience but it is still too soon to do that. It has been 2 weeks since I was there. The reasons I went there were not addressed and I was very disappointed. If you don't ask the right question, it leaves you open for them to interject the most expensive treatment. The way I see it, I am the lay person, they are the professionals. They need to ask you step by step if you can afford that next step. Although they did have a did have a organization that did help with the cost. I still feel cheated. I would like to come back after some time and reevaluate my comment. Maybe I will see and feel about things differently.<//Review>

I have brought my pets here for 5 years. I have been nothing but happy with the care my pets have had. The staff and Dr are all so nice. I will miss them as we were part of the campfire. We lost everything, even our vet. All i can say is, If you want the best care for your pet, This is the place.

<Text>Since moving to the Paradise area over 6 years ago I have always taken my dogs here my dog ended up having diabetes then went blind so I've been more then a few times I also get meds monthly for my dog and I have never once had any problems or issues with anything or any one of the employees. My dogs are always taken care of and once when I couldn't afford the meds they had some donated which was a blessing. I highly recommend this place for all your animal needs.<//Text><resp>None</resp><userid>100702277550471463128< /userid><GmapID>0x809cd4f344e55809:0x726b771807fd4a5f< /GmapID>< Rating>

The vet and her staff have always been very helpful and understanding. Dr. Mathan is always super busy with the stressed and hurt animals.  I appreciate her need to keep incidental appointments on topic and relatively short.  I prefer that she focus on my animals’ needs; I can freak out later, after they are better.  And she still creates a few moments to reassure and/or commiserate with owners.  Best vet in Paradise, hands down.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

My boyfriend and I grabbed a drink at Shannon Arms Irish Pub two nights in a row because we liked it so much! Both nights we just sat ourselves and received very prompt and friendly service. The beer choices are good and they even have two ciders. We tried some of the appetizers and the veggie burger which were all fantastic. The bar has a fun ambiance and on Thursday they have a live band which was great!</review>

Always a warm place where you can be yourself.  Bartender, Issey, makes a beautiful Irish coffee on cold evenings.  Just the right mix of slightly sweet, porportionate coffee-whiskey-cream and perfect temperature.  Also, well built Guinness!</Text>

I'm sure their beer is good, but I can get good beer anywhere. The upside is they let me pee there. The downside is the bathroom is filthy and I could see into the bar whilst relieving myself. In summary, go somewhere else unless you just want to pee with a view of the pool table.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Love this bar! Everyone there was Irish. Dropped by just to find a head on the way to taking pal to SFO from Santa Rosa. The Bar Maid created a fresh pot of coffee for an Irish. I will come back.< /review><gmap_id>0x808f7d919c33a191:0xe8e3b3f6dbc248eb</gmap_id>< rate>

Reminds of me a lot of an Irish pub. With Guinness on tap and bottles of Bullmers. Even down to having a picture of JFK on the wall.  But the bar definitely has an American twist.<//Text>

I hate that I love this place. Cheap drinks, friendly staff and a good time on Thursday nights. Attire is very casual which matches the decor. Look out for awesome cheap drinks on Thursdays!</text>

<Text>Comfortable place. My food was great, but my wife's breakfast was a little well done. Not much yolk in her fried eggs. Hash browns hard to cut with fork. She still enjoyed her meal. Waitress warmed up to us and was pleasant to share pleasantries with. We do not go here often, but will return when it strikes us.<//Text>< time>

I have to say during pandemic they were suffered their business, but now fully open up for business is great for them.
Same time they really need to improve their customer services period.
On my husband’s birth day went out to eat breakfast on Saturday, and it was pretty crowded understandable.
We put our name on list to out door sitting, we been waited for quite sometime to host to take us to out door,  but it didn’t happened, so I asked host how long do we have to wait, and what she said was very RUDE and un acceptable, “she quoted I’m very busy as you see”wow..wow.
The server was great I give him 5 stars just for him, and food also was good.
Not a good idea to go there on weekend.<//Text>

Fast seating by host and a very attentive waitress with a great personality. What I ordered was for breakfast, the food tested delicious. There seems to be great deal on the plate your ordering to select different sides 😍</review>

This IHOP has the best service, Love the way they make their Colorado Omelet its Keto friendly says my tummy. I give the Pancakes to my kids. We've been to other locations & this by far is the best location; customer service & food.</Review>

<Date>1616499655825<//Date><review>Thought Id give this place another chance. Its open for indoor dining and is social distance conscious. Servers were working better as a team since my last visit and the food was PERFECT!  Hats off to whomever is cooking the eggs....Perfectly cooked everytime. The owner is on the floor always available to say hello or to talk about our newest Sun City functions.
Id say this IHop is definately worth the visit. Prices a affordable, as well.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dc9dc710ec64df:0xa3e444040aa4bc72</GmapID><Rate>4</Rate><username>Diana Morgan</username>< pics>

<text>This IHOP is great!  It is always packed but they are able to get you in and out very quickly!  I love their tres leche pancakes.  I posted a picture for you.  They are so good!  They dont even need syrup.  This restaurant although busy, I have always seen it clean and tidy.  It is tucked away in the corner of the parking lot so make sure you do not pass it up.<//text></record>

Literally have been coming here since I first moved to Menifee which was over a decade ago and have been coming here since then and man they've consistently always been the best IHOP imo...food is always good and well portioned...only one time there was a "Karen" manager who was lil rude to my family until my Caucasian uncle talked to her but overall 👍</Review>

Support Exceptional Local Businesses Like This One!!!
Our family loves this IHOP! Since we moved to the area two 1/2 years ago we’ve always had excellent customer service that surpassed our expectations here. Even now, in these difficult times they continue to do so with little but meaningful gestures that show they are still going above and beyond. The family pack is an awesome deal for our family of 5 and the food is astonishingly perfect by the time it gets home; it’s like we’re in the restaurant.
Since receiving our stimulus check we’ve ordered here twice. We did curbside pickup last time and ordered delivery tonight. I enjoyed the curbside most because it was nice to see a familiar face, though the bottom half excluded due to the mask, and yes they are wearing gloves here. I was greeted warmly with familiarity and exchanged a quick distanced convo with words of encouragement back & forth.
Please join in supporting local businesses such as this establishment who help serve our community everyday with excellent customer services that stand out above the standard norm.
Thank you so much staff at our IHOP, stay safe stay healthy and know you’re all appreciated!< /Review>

This IHOP is great! Our server today was so sweet. We never felt like we had to ask for something, it was like she was able to read minds! The food was great and just as we ordered. I am definitely coming back again!< /Text>

I was pleasantly surprised, to IHOP in awhile and the service and food was excellent. I had a omelet and pancakes, it was very very tasty.  In addition to that they gave you a big size portion to eat. I'm a pretty big eater but I had to take some of it home. Very happy!!< /Review>

Very caring very attempting. Our waitress Kali thank you for checking on us with a great smile even though when we arrived it was a very busy time for them. I love the little details in this restaurant the little decor that make it feel cozy and not just a boring place. I will bring my family here more often.

Ordered online. Everything was prepared perfectly and they included all of the correct condiments without having to ask. I believe the owner was there overseeing the operation. Handed me a $5 off next visit all because my iced coffee was not ready with the order. This was not necessary as the fella had it ready in no time, but greatly appreciated 👍 . Other business owners and management teams could use a lesson from this place in how to keep a customer. This will continue to be my favorite breakfast food spot , especially for dinner.< /Review>

I never have any complaints about this IHOP.  The portions are large for the price but, I am happy about that. My children take home their left overs and snack on the food throughout the day. The customer service is pleasant. The wait can be long during certain hours but, you can call and find out the wait time before you go to the restaurant.</text>

I was quite pleased with this IHOP location. The food was what you'd expect. However, the service was excellent. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a manager who immediately began conversation with us. We felt right at home. This continued right up until we left.< /review>

IHOP was amazing. Great food with reasonable pricing. Our waiter was easily the best waiter that we've had at any restaurant in the past five years. Robert was very pleasant and respectful and attentive and you can tell he loves his job and likes dealing with people! A.j. ..... Newman, Ca.<//text>

I prefer going to this IHOP instead of the Murrieta one, even though it is further from my home in French Valley. Its a lot cleaner at this one and the staff is much more professional. Came in this morning with a party of seven and was seated promptly. Robert our server was wonderful. He was upbeat, pleasant, and attentive to our table. Food was decent, standard IHOP fare. Food came out very quickly. My only complaint was some of the silverware was dirty and the hash browns are always undercooked here unless you specify crispy. I will continue to go to this location.</text>

I had the California Scramble and it was so good I cleaned up my plate completely. My wife got the other kind of scramble and she did the same thing with the food.

Our server was really attentive. Overall, great food and great service. Highly recommended.</review>

We had an amazing Christmas lunch today with my elderly mother in law. The food was hot and yummy, and all the employees were gracious and fun despite the Christmas Day crowds. We will definitely be back!</Text>

Our waitress was amazing. She was very attentive towards us, checking up on us frequently. When I had to pay I was short on cash and she said it was not a problem. I wish I could have gotten her name, but regardless she was the best. It was The first time coming to this IHOP and I would come back.</Review>

She never stands still and the IHOP we went to in Sun City has a valuable employee. IHOP is luck to have her and I will return for her winning serv oh ve and food.

<Review>This IHOP is one of the better locations in this area. The staff tends towards the older end of the spectrum, and for some reason that makes the service faster and more friendly, while virtually eliminating unnecessary talkativeness.
6/29/18 - went for the steak burger promotion and was NOT disappointed. The brunch burger was amazing!!!</Review>< pics>

I have never had anything besides breakfast even thought they do serve other food. The wait is normally pretty decent even on the weekends. They just renovated this one so it's nice and new looking. The staff has always been friendly and the prices are ok. They do charge a lot for the sides so if you can get one of the meals do that. It's a solid 4 star review and would probably be a 4.5 if that was an option. Only knock is the prices.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Excellent and friendly staff.  I have had breakfast lunch and dinner at the Menifee I Hop on Newport Street, many times.   I got to meet the owner, Barbara, and tonight her son, Chris.  Together, they have made it family enjoyable.  I love that the syrups on the table are not sticky showing also a clean restaurant!! The pancakes are huge, fluffy and delicious even without syrup.  I give this
IHop an A+.<//Text>

We love IHOP! Been going there for over a decade. Friendly Staff & Servers. Food is always delicious, if something is not right, they make it right. Little kids love it also bce they can eat breakfast for dinner if they choose. Great kids menu too! You can also order by phone for pick up. The atmosphere is welcoming & very clean! There are Servers that have been there for years! Go check it out!< /Review>

****updater 10/12/2020*****
Usually dined in for family night every other weekend. Last night we were ignored. We showed up around 5:30pm, family of 5. Stood there, sat there a few minutes, and left since we were not greeted or acknowledged for being there or even offered a table. Since the re-opening this is our 3rd time there. I hope they get the service improved. Now that some places are reopening there will be plenty of other places to eat at with better service. Dropped 5 star rating to a 1.

Always clean, nice remodel, and the service is always good.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>My wife and I had breakfast here this morning and I can only say two good things about it. The waitress was wonderful and we had a gift card so we did not have to pay for a horrible breakfast. The eggs were so hard you could bounce a quarter off of them. My wife asked for them scrambled soft and even sent them back. When they came back they were still overcooked. We ordered our hash browns extra crispy on both sides but that didn't matter. They were still under cooked and only on one side. The toast is a given that it will be dry with little to no butter. Not the worst bacon I have had there at least. We had a twenty five dollar gift card so the meal and the tip covered it. Now we have a new place to eat that we will not go to again.......

I'm giving it 5 stars because the service was AWESOME! I've been twice in the past week or so and the first time the food was pretty crappy not gonna lie.. But the second time it was really good! All waiters/waitresses, hosts, bus boys, etc. are really helpful, nice, and happy! Which let me tell you, is hard to find in retail these days! I will definitely come back!</text>

Excellent times 10!! every time, no matter what time we go. This IHOP is not your typical IHOP restaurant, this is a very homey and very clean place with a franchise name. You simply can not compare this location with any other IHOP, its not possible. The place is run by the owner and her family in the way every restaurant SHOULD be run. The service is great, the food comes out the way you ask for it, hot and with great presentation and it taste good, what else can you ask for?</Text>

I love IHOP...the best coffee always...the food is always delicious and the pot roast, you can cut it with a fork and melts in your mouth.  The country fried steak is awesome.  I love the strawberry crepes...yummm<//text>

Not a huge fan of IHOP, but this was the best IHOP I have ever been to in my life. The restaurant was spotless, and the food was wonderful. The thing that makes this restaurant stand out above all others is the wonderful staff that works here. Our waitress Sara D. was so sweet and her service was flawless. Even the cashier Judy was amazing, and how often does a person remember their cashier? This was by far the best experience I have ever had at IHOP, and I will be back numerous times. I want to thank the owners for hiring such a wonderful and friendly crew.</Text>

<review>From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed. The warm smiles and greeting by the staff and possibly owner. We felt as we had walked in to our own neighborhood coffee shop. Rae was wonderful and invited us to come back. On our next adventure towards Temecula we may make a detour and come back to Menifee.</review>< Pictures>

Made a reservation for 9. Myself my three kids, parents and their three foster kids. Manager was great took our name over the phone and had us seated promptly. Not that it should matter but we are Hispanic. Our server was Jennifer. After our breakfast my father got up to pay the bill. We stayed at the table waiting for her to bring a box. The entrance was getting full of people waiting to be seated. We are not rude and did not push our way out. We waited until there was a clear path to the door. As we were about to leave. Jennifer our server outstreached her arms and said "Wait a minute who's paying here?" Asking the kids first then myself. I was appalled she assumed we would not pay our measly $75 bill having kids with us. I told her my Father paid. She didn't believe me and asked my Father herself. She didn't believe him either, asked "You did, you paid with a credit card?" She didn't even apologize. She made presumptions because we are Hispanic and a large party that we would be capable of skipping out on the bill. We have never been accused like that anywhere. The kids were saddened that this waitress felt the need to block us from the door. Today happens to be one of my Foster sisters birthday. Way to go Jennifer! Way to ruin what was a pleasant family breakfast. You need to get your racial profiling in check Ma'am. Needless to say we won't be visiting this IHOP anymore.<//Review>

Went here for dinner the food was standard ihop menu but the service from the manager went above and beyond what is expected and it makes things really nice when someone does more than even what is expected I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys quality food and great people ....<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good food and wonderful attention. We went to celebrate my daughter's birthday and they gave her a little plate of snow. Thanks.

(Original)
Muy buena la comida y la atención de maravilla. Fuimos a festejar el cumpleaños de mi hija y le obsequiaron un platito de nieve. Gracias.< /Review>
