<text>Best pizza and service in Santa Monica! Whether you're in the mood for a classic or something new, SaMo's pizza selection will satisfy. They even offer a hot cheetos pizza. I'm a personal fan of the Mediterranean, which has meatballs, two cheeses, and a perfect combination of fresh veggies and seasonings. They also have fresh salads and sandwiches.

The staff at SaMo are all friendly and clearly love pizza making. You can taste the high quality of ingredients, the prices are competitive, and service is quick.

They're conveniently located right across from SaMo College and just a half-hour walk/5-10 minute drive from the beach.</text>< user_id>

<text>Not bad pizza place.The interior design is clean and simple.The pizza is delicious and full.The downside is that the variety of pizzas here is a bit limited, with some basic flavors being the main focus.In addition, I suggest selling more snacks and side dishes such as salads and chicken wings, and alcoholic drinks.</text>< Pictures>

<review>I really can't trust reviews.  I ordered this pizza based on the 4.6 star review. I should have ordered Domino's.  It would have been cheaper ($30 bucks for a large peppers/mush) and would have been as good.  This is the first pizza I ever had that was so tasteless we looked at each other and said "this tastes like nothing".  The ordering online and delivery was accurate and on time so the stars are for the service and not for the pizza.  I do wish that pizza deliveries would figure out how to get your pizza here hot.  I was not that far away and it got here at room temperature.  I would pay more for a delivery that is hot.  Go to Dominos and save money.</review><user_name>B B<//user_name>< response>

<Text>The crust is nice and thin, very delicate! The sauce is very good and they fire it in a hot pizza oven. We ordered several personal size 10" pies, the pepperoni was great, but the cheese pies were a little inconsistent with the meltiness. They had a great special on a 10" cheese or pepperoni for 4.99 and 5.99 respectively, so we ordered a bunch of those. I also had a house salad that was pretty standard, but good. The pizza menu is pretty extensive, but also pretty expensive! Some of the personal size pies were like $20. I'd like to try the vegetarian pie, but don't wanna shell out $17 for a thin 10" pie from a strip mall pizza stand with 4 tables. Either step up the ambiance or drop the prices.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Back again at the place my grandson says have the best pizzas in the WORLD. Ah, to be young again ...

The pizzas ARE quite good and their method of ordering is quite easy. You can order a pizza straight off of their menu or customize it pretty much any way you can imagine. Think of it like Subway - except the pizzas are terrific and delivered to your table piping hot.

There is a great vibe to this place and it is catchy. My grandson loves the condiment area (but likes the garlic way too much). they have a huge tree in the building along with some very neat pizza ovens. Make sure you try the Nutella Calzone.

Definitely will be back again when visiting the grandchildren. We could use something like this in New Jersey!< /Text>

Still the best SAMO pizza  I've had in the three years since my husband and I discovered the place. Teeny shop, one man operation, but he's so good at what he does. The thin chewy crust and sparing use of his delicious red sauce really make the pizza. 9 out of 10 times I order the sausage and red onion. We've had the Los Angeles , too, but I find it a tad too salty. Cash only! thank you< SaMo Pizza<//text>

Compared to the other  pizza joint down the street there is no contest. Not only is Samo pizza extremely affordable, But it’s always fresh and delicious. You can tell the staff really cares about making food.<//text>

Stop #268 for @pizzas365: SaMo Pizza has only a moderately bearable pizza. It tastes fine overall, but the cheese is nothing special, and the sausage is too fatty. I would not recommend this pizza. 2.8 Stars.</Text>

I lived at eves San Rafael for slightly over a year. My leasing agent, LENKA EISENHARDT was truly a professional, calm and informative. She made my experience in leasing my apartment so easy and so exciting. LENKA is focused making sure to “cross all her T’s and dot her  I’s”.  I’d just like to add that Lenka is very proud of her company and proud to represent this particular private apartment community...eves San Rafael< /review>

Exceptional in every way: great unit, great people, and fantastic service, from the front office to the maintenance dept.  Common areas are immaculate, and staff could not be friendlier or more accommodating. They truly care about the residents, giving the property a feeling of home. They are always welcoming and smiling. The organized community gatherings are a wonderful way to get to meet your neighbors.  I have very much enjoyed living here over the past 5 years.

The view from my living room is Mt Tam and faces the side of a beautiful hillside where a family of deer like to take their evening walk.The sunsets are amazing and I am surrounded by beautiful trees. The staff in the office are just as amazing as the view. They have gone above and beyond whenever I have needed anything and regularly put on events where you get the opportunity to get to know your neighbors and build that good old fashioned sense of community. I have built some great friendships here and memories around the pool and hot tub during the summer with my family. James is an extraordinary manager as well as Lenka and Javier. They all make a great team and do an amazing job in the office. If you are thinking of moving into The Eaves I highly recommend it!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1578431342950, 'text': "Leticia, I really appreciate you sharing your experience!

<Review>I love living at the Eaves. The management and maintenance staff is excellent and so helpful. The views can be outstanding and each apartment has a deck. The pet positive atmosphere is a wonderful plus for me... The nature throughout the complex is soothing and beautiful and makes for some nice walks. If you like challenges, walking the hills is a good workout. Gym has good equipment and is open all the time to residents and the pool is clean and well kept. I have met some terrific people and dogs and receive some smiles on my walks that make my day. I appreciate that there is a diverse community. Northgate Shopping Center is across the freeway.

I have very few negatives and those I do have are usually resolved in a timely manner.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Pluses-
Great management.
Any repairs are always done within 24 hours.
Very quiet, dog friendly community.

Minuses-
No A/C so my 3rd floor apartment gets hot in the summer.  You will need a portable unit for your bedroom at least.
Water and sewer waste charges added to rent at approximately $65-70 per month.  Total additional charges (not including PG&E) approximately $100-$120/month so be sure to budget for that.

Overall a great place to live.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1577829224947, 'text': "I appreciate the time you took to tell us how you feel, J!

I've lived in multiple apartment complexes in San Rafael and SF.  The people that work at Eaves are by far the most friendly, most client focused, bend over backwards for you group I have ever encountered.  From James and his office team... to the maintenance team... They truly work like a family to serve the community they oversee at Eaves.  Anna is always looking out for the residents, in the moving in/moving out process, to anything they can do to help make your living experience the best it can be at Eaves.  The community itself tends to be very quiet and peaceful... You can have bad neighbors in any community, but I haven't experienced it here..  Martin and the maintenance staff do an outstanding job, from keeping the pool safe and clean, to showing up promptly for appointments when something is in need of fixing in the apartment.  You're always welcome to come into the office, get your 4-legged animal a treat (they love your animals!) , and see what's going on in the community that week.  I will truly miss the people at Eaves as my wife and I are moving into our first home.. but, this is the best Apartment complex I've lived in during my past 4 years (and 4 apartments) in the North Bay.  Keep it up James and team!!!</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>This is well run from top to bottom.  Clean, quiet and cozy.
Super convenient but nicely secluded.
Well managed parking with a covered space for each unit.
Grounds are well maintained, pool is cleaned daily.
Kitchen is a nice size and appliances are in good condition; wish there was a gas stove.
Bathrooms are up to date with one-piece tub/surround so there can't be future caulk issues.
And get this... trash is collected at your door EVERY morning.
Many units have exceptional views.
And no, I don't work here and I'm not a friend of the owners. 😊<//Text>< Name>

< Review>
We've lived here 1-1/2 years & have been very happy here. It's a very good value for the space & attractiveness of the units & property. The staff has been amazing. They're very friendly & helpful. Several times during the year they have a BBQ or the like for the community. At Christmas they had a gift wrapping station. They truly go above & beyond! It's also very dog friendly.</Review>

We are now in our second apartment here; transferred to a larger unit in a different building after three years. Love our apartment, the management team,  and in general, the community overall! I had previously rated the community lower due to an issue with our building's elevator, but the management eventually got a short-term workaround applied to tide us over [thanks, James!] until the permanent fix can be made ; so I am raising our rating back to four stars...<//Text>

<review>I experienced a significant change in my life circumstances halfway through the application process and in my opinion the staff went above and beyond to not only accommodate me and my new circumstances, but make me feel truly welcome during what could have been a very difficult time. The residents I've met so far has been quite friendly and the complex itself is beautiful and well-maintained. Highly recommend this place!< /review><gmap_id>0x80859827fcda07df:0x1435da0838a6b3eb</gmap_id><rating>4<//rating>< pics>

<Review>We have lived here for one year.  We have been very pleased.  As we know the complex isn't brand new, we feel the age adds character and the apartments have been upgraded to reflect modern changes.  We love our little apartment, and we have an awesome view with wild life right outside below our deck almost daily.  The conveniences to stores and work are great.  The amenities are perfect with nice appliances, washer/dryer and maintenance has been very responsive to any requests.
Lenka is amazing.  So friendly and helpful at move in assisting the movers and ongoing as are others in the office.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Great apartment complex. after two years without any problem i decide to move out because i was relocated from my job.
my only reason for 4stars it's because the parking spots, there is no enough space for invite friends or if you have a second car you have to always parking on the streets.< /text>

<Review>I have lived at the Eaves Apartments in San Rafael for about 2 years. This place is quiet and I have been pleasantly surprised to find the most incredibly friendliest management staff and equally important the maintenance staff that is not only friendly but very efficient in handling so many work orders for this large apartment complex with the most friendliest disposition I have ever experienced.

I would like to begin with James Ackbaraly, Manager. Despite the variety of personalities he manages to keep everyone's best interest in mind and manages to keep everyone as happy as the situation allows. I don't know how  he does it but Mr. Ackbaraly continues to keep our community running smoothly which seems impossible for me because it is such a large complex with a  whole lot of different personalities and at times weird ones. Anytime there is a problem he is quick to find a way to resolve it with everyone's best interest in mind. I am in awe of his abilities to keep our community running so smoothly on a daily basis. I usually see him walking around the complex when he is not in the office helping to keep watch that our environment is clean, safe, and often notice that he goes out of his way to make sure everyone is happy. My personal experience of how Mr. Ackbaraly goes above and beyond is once I had an emotional breakdown and he took out time from his busy day to help me by just being kind. Which leads to not forget to mention Javier Herrador, community consultant also another kind soul that goes above and beyond to make sure our community is happy. Whenever there is a problem he is quick to make sure it gets resolved with everyone's best interest in mind. Whenever I see him in the office or around the apartment complex he is always ready to offer a friendly smile and genuinely ask how everyone is doing and if the tenant is having a bad day he is ready to put his busy day aside to help if he can which he has done for me often. Mr. Herrador has made my day when feeling low several times by just being kind and going above and beyond. Another community consultant that I do not want to forget to mention is Lenka Eisenhardt. Ms. Eisenhardt is equally kind and goes out of her way to make sure our community is happy. There have been times I was feeling low and she made my day by being kind.

Management is not the only impressive part of our community. The maintenance staff is also incredible. I would like to begin with Danny Grant, Maintenance manager. Mr. Grant is also often found walking around taking care of his duties and making sure we are all safe, clean, and happy. I am pleasantly surprised that like our management team he is also friendly and kind. Another impressive staff member is Martin Bellinger, Maintenance technician 3, from my personal experience he has always been diligent in making sure apartment work orders are fixed in a timely manner. I have been so touched by the way Mr. Bellinger goes above and beyond when he sees you and even if there is no work order will commonly ask how's everything and is also genuinely kind. Another impressive staff member is Ron Oliver, Maintenance tech 2. Mr. Oliver also goes above and beyond. He is very contentious making sure the tenant is happy with the way he repaired the complaint order. He is equally friendly and kind. Last but not least there is Julio Meprano, Maintenance tech 1. Mr. Meprano is equally friendly and kind. Mr. Meprano is often found keeping our community clean and safe. It is also a pleasure to run into him to get a friendly smile and experience his kind nature.

I took the time to make sure I post this review because of how impressive and rare it is to have such an amazing group of people that often go above and beyond with their duties. The Eaves Apartments in San Rafael is a great place to live because it's on top of a nature preserve, quiet, close to everything you need and most of all the staff is incredible! Very rare.

I am obviously very happy to have found such a great place to live.

My gf, dog, and I lived here for 3 years and loved it. The neighbors are very friendly, quiet, and respectful. James, the head of the property, is readily available and hands on. Martin, the repair guy, is prompt, friendly, and good with dogs. Very clean and nice pool and workout area.<//text>

I would like to say Javier an Martin at Eaves Avolon apartments are A # One. My doggie is 16 yrs old and Blind, def and before i knew it he had fell off my deck and rolled down the hillside. I was beside myself and thinking im never going to see my renster ever again. i first tried to get to him but it was impossible to get to him from the bottom of the road. I came back up the hill to the office an Javier was there i told him that Ren had fell off the deck and he right away he called the maintenance and Martin came to help Javier and they went down the hill and found my doggy. He was alive thank god an Javier and Martin Brought him safely back up the hill.
I am forever grateful to them and everyone else at Eaves Apartment Living for making me feel like Im not alone in a crisis.
Thank You Again for all your help

340 unit 144-good luck to future renters

If you want to live with roaches in a cheap renovated apartment, this is the place you are been looking for. During the last 10 months i have had nothing but problem. The unit has been “renovated” in a cheap way to make it look ok. My unit flooded and nasty dirty water was all over the bathroom, room, kitchen, dining area, living room. They came in and replaced part of the carpet and took out all the water but didn’t bother to put me a hotel while they were working on it so i had to deal with people being in my unit and their equipment being all over my unit. Laundry had flooded few weeks prior to this. Weeks later i found bugs and roaches so i even sent pictures to the manager (don’t have a reason to make this up) and a company came in for treatment but they only spray the areas that had bugs and roaches. Roaches continue coming up around the unit. came in a second time for treatment and had me out of my unit for few hours so they can get the job done. Roaches kept coming up so i called and they told me to give it a month! for treatment to function properly. after a month i still kept seeing roaches and came in for a third treatment. Not done yet....i can hear RATS! walking around through the pipes! not just that but i have found dead rats walking towards my unit! finally moving out since they were not willing to put me in a different unit and pay for moving expenses since i’m not responsible for all the issues i’ve had but all i got at the end for the manager was “you have to understand these all old units and some times we can’t control some of the issues” i get it, but if they are old units, don’t price them so high if you are aware of all the issues we are going to potentially run into. They did allow me to break my lease 2 months prior to our original terms now after all the reviews i’ve read on moving out,  i’m afraid they will keep my deposit.<//text>

They have one Woman, Roslyn, that is so nasty, that I hated to go into the Office, to ask for a package.
If you are looking there, Anna, and Mark are great.

Beware, people move in and out on a daily basis.
So if you are into Corporate living, it might fit the bill; if no, it's not the place for you .
lot's of shady residence as well.
Police activity, at least 3 times in the 6 months that I lived there , Just an FYI.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

*UPDATE* been living here for 2 years and still loving it. The staff provide a Rolls Royce service for a reasonable price, and treat you with compassion and respect.

Eaves has been a dream come true for me and my partner. We moved from the UK and the staff could not have been more helpful in making this international move and giving us piece of mind and helping every step of the way. Big things like taking in furniture deliveries down to small things like providing good advice and help.

We have had only one repair needed which was some bubbles coming up our sink one time - it was fixed the same day and Martin was very puntual and communicative.

Lenka in front office is an absolute hero and I don't know what we would have done without her. She has gone above and beyond for us in every way, even though she is clearly very busy, she always makes time and is so friendly and professional.<//Review>

I live here about a year and a half.
During this time, I had to solve some difficult problems.
For example, moving from one apartment to another before the end of the lease.
All the staff very kindly and carefully helped me to solve any of my questions - both simple and more complex.
Especially benevolently and carefully helps to solve any problems Lenka Eisenhardt - Community Consultant. She very strong helped me to solve the problem of moving to a more comfortable apartment, when this apartment was vacated.
So it happened that now she temporarily works in the office alone instead of three employees. Despite the very high workload, she still very carefully and responsibly tries to explain any question and help solve any problem faster and better.
Exactly such workers as Lenka Eisenhardt create a extremely comfortable atmosphere at Eaves. I would like to thank her with all my heart for the excellent attitude towards people and the responsibility for her work.

So we have lived here for between 6-10 years and the rents here are prity high, 3000 for a one bedroom. The staff here are great and the matinence work really hard to keep the entire place really clean. The pool is heated and the hot tube is nice. There is a clean and nice weight room and the staff is always friendly.

Most of the community contributes to helping to keep the peace clean by cleaning up after them selves and not just leaving trash everywhere. However in the 310 building there seems to be a large group of residents that don’t seem to care much about the place they live and don’t take care of things and expect the staff to do things like pick up the residentsgarbage or else these residents just throw it on the ground in the Garbage shed so much do you can’t even walk in the door. The staff clean it up daily and these same resident just do it again the next day or two. It’s very discouraging and must be very much so for the staff.<//Text>

Went in there to get ice cream for my pregnant girlfriend. Decided on a triple scoop. The worker asked if I wanted in separate cups. I said no, I don't want to pay more than $6.99. They asked me if I wanted in separate cups many more times & I said ok that would be great but as long as its not more than $6.99. They rung me up as 3 single scoops for almost $12. I told them, this is literally all I was trying to explain the whole time. The manager comes from the back without being called or any prior knowledge of what happens and observes the situation. She says if I want to pay $6.99 then we have to put it all on one cup. I say, seriously, after all this you are going to make an example? They proceed shake my ice cream into one big cup. Half of my ice cream was stuck to the little cups which were wasted and thrown away. Definitely one of the most ridiculous experiences of my entire year.< /Review>

Due to medical issues can not wear a mask. Informed girl working when she asked. She went and got her manager and he refused service due to my medical issue.
He was more than pleasant to help the gentleman standing behind me and my daughter who was not wearing a mask.
The second girl then told two other people behind him who also who were not wearing mask to "just pull your shirt up"
VERY unprofessional and rascist.< /text>

<Text>Worse experience EVER!! Not only was the staff extra rude but when we asked for the manager he did nothing and said RULES are RULES. When we got our order not only did they charge me for 2 extra ice creams but they did not get our order right and when asked for a refund and our correct order she said she didn’t have to serve me. I asked for corporates number they claimed they did not have one and ignored me! My 5 year old did not have to experience this at all! GOOD ONE!</Text>< pics>

We love this place not just for the delicious ice cream but the fact the management and staff and customers are truly honest people with a conscience. 20 minutes before closing time, my wife took our 2 young girls for some ice cream. Once my wife got on the road to head home, she realized she left her credit card wallet that has her drivers license and all her important cards at Baskin-Robbins. She called the store and the manager answered and said a customer found it and brought it to the staff. My wife arrived after closing time and the staff gave my wife her wallet back in tact. We are sooo grateful there are still great people out there. Thank you Baskin-Robbins staff and customers</Review>

one of the best places for ice cream. A lot of different flavors and no problem sampling them all. It is not very visible from the street so if you drive down ventura road make sure you don't miss it( I did). Pistachio is my favorite one<//Text>

Can't say enough good things about this place. I had a flat tire in the pouring rain, far from home. At another tire shop they told me I had to buy a new tire, had a bolt on the side, impossible to fix. So I came to Les Schwab to buy a new tire. But turns out they fixed the flat tire within 10 minutes, maybe 5 minutes, and didn't charge me anything for it. I tried to pay but they wouldn't let me.

Thank you so much! I was having a pretty bad day, getting rained on all night while tent camping, but you made my day. You really made my day. Thank you!<//text>

Took about 1 and 1/2 hours to fix flat tire.  Picked up a nail. Store very busy.  Very friendly, COVID compliant.  No charge, complementary.  Would go again.</Review>

< Review>
I was traveling home to Wisconsin and had a flat tire on Sunday morning.
The owner put his plans on hold and mounted a new tire and had me on my way in no time.
As a result I made it home on schedule.
I can't thank him enough for the great service.

Got a flat tire near a campsite 40 miles away, these folks were able to take me in right away midday Saturday, were really courteous, gave me a visitor's discount and patched up my tire and had me on the road back to BC within an hour!</Review>

My husband were headed to Utah and we had an issue with our skid plate making noise and rubbing on our front tires.  We are not from the area but we stopped in and this store was truly amazing ....  JD came out and got us in right away and fixed the problem.  Thank you so much JD and the office gals  (We were the couple who had our cat with us 😇)</review>

Clean and bright store, plenty of convenient parking, well dressed and polite staff.  Even better showed up here on a long holiday weekend and they fixed my flat - for free!  While I was waiting I heard them checkout two satisfied customers who were delighted with their service.   What's not to love?  Well done Les Schwab in Burney, CA</review>

It is not well marked for getting in and out. Google maps shows it can be accessed from the back on either side. This is not true. You must enter from the front off the highway and if you are driving a truck pull through to the back and turn around there. This is not indicated.<//text>

I came in yesterday and picked out 4 new Goodyear tires for my SUV, and arranged for them to be held for my appointment today. I come in today at 11, and they tell me the tire guy is running a little late to work. The manager proceeds to tell me there will be a wait, which I can understand. 2 hours later, the tire tech is still not in, and there is a line waiting just to be seen going out of automotive. I got my keys and left, because they had 3 lube techs and no tire guy...and nobody seems to know how to mount a tire but the guy who didn't show up.

Manager blamed it on Wal-Mart. I made sure to tell him that if he was a half decent manager, he wouldn't have left me unaware and wasting my time. He should have managed that, being he is supposed to be a manager.

Last time I was here, they messed up my power windows on another car. Guess I went against my better judgement by giving them another chance.

Go somewhere else, or take your chances at a bad experience.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Synthetic Oil EVERYWHERE! Went to get an oil change at approx 3pm with tire change, guy said it was going to take 3 hours, they had cars ahead etc. So we waited. Vehicles were done (took two) and upon getting into the vehicle I noticed the steering wheel was oily and center console was oily had a glob of oil on it from the mechanics elbow! A day later I started smelling burnt oil. Some online forums say in some cases it's normal after Subaru's Ascent's to smell like burnt oil after an oil change. So I looked underneath the car the second day I noticed oil dripping. So out of curiosity I open the hood and lo and behold there is the oil cap just sitting there and the engine covered in oil.</Text>< Pictures>

My husband and I purchased tires online,when purchased was told it would be no more than an hour wait to install new tires. I have now been here for 3 hours and I'm STILL waiting. I'm pretty sure they skipped me without notice. It took me walking outside to see that my car was parked and to tell the front desk associate that I knew there were two cars ahead of me but since then there are more and more people coming and there cars are being worked on before mine. She politely apologized. Had they been honest with me since the beginning I would have made other arrangements than to sit here for 3 plus hours.</review>

This Upland Walmart auto and lube center provides some of the best customer service and also sets high expectations for themselves and for the customers satisfaction. They are well educated and experienced enough to get the job done right and if there is an issue or something was not done correctly you don't have to hesitate to bring that up here because they'd be happy fix their own mistakes so that way you the customer is satisfied. I recommend this location to anyone in the area who need such a thing completed. I was a Walmart support manager which is one manager about customer service and I can tell you that I knew would it take to get the job done and this location has as well so they will get the job done correctly and you will be satisfied customer.< /Text>

Good prices and large selection of items for the home. However, always, always check the seals and caps of anything you buy from Walmart.  For example, cheap and unscrupulous people will buy the windshield fluid gallon for about $1.50 and use some of it, refill it with water, and return it! How do I know this? The jugs come with glued aluminum cap seals. The jugs that have been tampered will have missing seals or halfway opened seal. Also, the jugs that have been diluted with water are several shades lighter blue than the full strength jugs.  Of the dozen or so jugs that were stocked, nearly half were tampered.  Employees should check the seals of fluids before accepting returns.  I've also had issues with aftershave balm bottles that are half full or empty!  Always be skeptical and check the seals and content of everything you buy from Walmart.</text>

Great service and great price. I did my oil change syntactic for under 50 bucks on my van. I shop while I waited and killed two birds with one stone. I came on a Friday around 3pm i was out in 40 mins just like they told me. Jiffy lube was charging me 96 bucks for my oil change. No thanks! Will be back here for my next oil change service. Walk ins only no appointments.< /Text>

Walmart's Auto Care Center provided me with excellent service.  I brought a tire in (due to a slow leak) for road hazard warranty repair (purchased with the tires at Walmart).  They couldn't repair the tire, so they replaced it at No Cost to me.  Needless to say, I was very pleased with their friendly, helpful service.< /text>

I was told by a mechanic elsewhere, that my battery was not cycling with enough power 291 CCA instead of 750 CCA, so I took it back to see about replacing it under warrantee.  Ronald did a quick check of it right away for me and it showed a full charge.  More than that info., the battery is rated 650 CCA and showed well over that.  It seems that it is due to the inappropriate rating selected by the mechanic is the reason it showed low, but Ronald followed up with a slower full check and charge on the battery and that agreed that the battery is good.  So, I can feel cofident that my battery is not causing problems due to low cycling.  Yay!< /review>

Went in to find some jerk that came in after us jumped the line. I brought this to the attention of rhe service writer and the customer and the customer replied he goes there all the time and knows how to work the system. I asked the advisor if they were going to do it bu the order we arrived and she said no.

<text>Came to exchange a car battery I bought 18 months ago. The cell became unchargeable. I got it with two years warranty. Something that should have taken 10 minutes tops, it took them two and a half hours to get done. They kept saying that the person that holds the keys to the batteries, called out sick, but that a manager from within the store has an extra key? But yet, it took them 2 1/2 hrs. To help me.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

Some of the workers are rude and unperfesinal
Had took my car if for new front tires and asked  for them to rotate and to check for a leaks and change the air tips  also an oil change
Got charged 4 my oil 2 tires and all air tips but 2 of them were not changed out
The worker said they were fine
Thanks to Walmart I need new back tires with in a moth tires stated to split due to a leake  and oil change  just messed up my drive way (leak) so messy</text>

After buying new batteries, tires, and oil changes for years, would not honor their lifetime balance service. Claimed I had stolen the tires and mounted them on my car, even though I had the receipt with me. Finally agreed to give me a one time balance on the tires and then left a huge grease stain on my cloth seats. Last time I bought anything from Walmart in a long time.<//text>

Worst customer service. Battery died under 5 year warranty. No replacement, instead was told that the sticker on the battery was the date it's good till. (It is the date the battery is received). Left with no working car. Thanks wal mart.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) This time I only bought a Battery for my car and the Auto Care place I recommend it because there is always someone who can assist you and without instead the Walmarts that do not have that service are very neglected, you mark them so that someone comes to assist you and nobody comes.

La atención y el servicio más malo que pueda uno encontrar,  lo encuentra aquí, un cambio de aceite tardo tres horas.  Los mecánicos los ve uno con el teléfono en la  mano y los clientes esperando.

<review>I went inside and paid for gas, then the pump wouldn’t work so they told me to come back inside because it didn’t charge me. Then when I check my bank turns out they charged me twice for the gas. I’ve had to come in three different times and now they’re telling me I got a wait 48 hours. Check your bank statement. At the very worst I had to wait 48 hours maybe more to get back my money after their mistake not cool<//review>< Pictures>

This is a local gas station with good prices. But the staff is very biased and racist. I have seen them reject a homeless person who was trying to buy a drink and chips, the staff working there said he was dirty and his money was dirty cause he was homeless. Then at another time the staff treated a African American like trash for nothing more then her race. I will never go back there regardless if it's local. I would not recommend this place to anyone as there are better places to go that will treat you better then this place.</review>

<Review>Been going here for over 15 yrs. The guy that owns this place, Pauly, will price gouge you if he thinks he can get away with charging more. Told me the candy I was buying was $0.50 more than it has been for the past 5 yrs. I called him out for overcharging me and he blamed other employees for "costing him money." No. You cost yourself a customer.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x809b52545109a9fb:0x8d9020db3fb4df6d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Ms Karen is very good .
Great on returning calls when leaving a message..
Great customer service on the phone and also in person..

Some things are out of her hands with the promo's and prices but her attitude reflects a lot with her customer service..

Thank you ms Karen.
Keep up the great work.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1617312788940, 'text': 'Hi Family, thanks so much for your review!

<review>I have been with this location of Extra Space Storage for nearly a year now. I have always found the management here to be very helpful and courteous.  Every question I have had they answered. The rates are fair and the facility is always kept clean. I especially appreciate the manager, Karen, who has been very thoughtful and professional. Thank you for the great service.< /review>< pics>

So it took me a few days to finally make a decision on what storage I wanted to go with due to me needing a particular size and of course trying to find the best rate. During them few days I spoke with Brandy Knox multiple times not only did she go out of her way To check her sister locations on the very first Interaction she had with me over the phone but she even followed up the next day.. She was nice enough to extend my reservation because She seen that I wanted the unit but I just couldn’t make a decision without my husband. He wanted something bigger, somjust in case my husband didn’t find what he needed I would get what I wanted.  Customer service nowadays is Hit and Miss more Miss  than Hit!, I’m very happy with the customer service I received from Brandy. She went above and beyond she did her job thoroughly. She was  everything I expect when I do business with a company. I appreciate every ounce of effort she put towards me moving  into my unit .  I highly think her for just doing her job ,, most people nowadays can’t even do that much! So kudos to Brandy and kudos to extra space storage,  they’re lucky to have her have her</text>

Jenna is already making a bad place better.  My first experiences were really terrible.    Wrong information and rude office managers.  Nothing but stress and immaturity.  Jenna was positive, professional and mature.  She didn’t give me bad information either.   The 3 stars is 0 for one for my first 6 months there being horrible and 5 for Jenna.  I don’t want ES thinking they’re a 5 star.  It’s Jenna who’s a 5 star employee.< /Review>

Extra Space Storage is a great Location for storage. Their customer service is top level, and the employee Karen went above and beyond to explain everything to us to make sure we are getting the best deal. Even though it was raining, she spent enough time showing us different sizes of storage spaces. Their prices are also very reasonable compared to other storage space locations. I would recommend this place to anyone that I know.</Text>

Stopped by with my mother today to look for a unit. Unfortunately the size we wanted wasn't available. Brandy was amazing and helped us find a unit at another location. She is supper knowledgeable and the sweetest person ever. She even made my mother laugh and that's a difficult thing with the state she is currently in.

After an unpleasant experience at another storage facility I was stuck on the side of the road with a 26 foot U-Haul that had to be returned that day and nowhere to go. Luckily for me I called this facility and spoke with Tammy who was absolutely marvelous and was able to get us the correct container in a matter of minutes! She even worked out the details with us on the drive over, I can’t say enough how amazing she was-really saved the day!<//text>

I was a longtime customer and 18 months ago due to finances had to close out my storage unit. Recently it had worked out that I can pay for storage again. Due to my previous experience with your employees and their customer service I didn’t hesitate to return. Even knowing there are lower prices available at other places I’m happy with the service your management at this location provides. They are very helpful and units are in excellent condition. If any problems arise the address them professionally and timely.</review>

<review>I rate this storage a 10....well a 5 on this scale, but a 10 is understood globally.  Upon entering the office, you are greeted and made to feel comfortable.  It is self-service supplies on display within the office.  What size, price and insurance add up as always.  I think their sale of 1st month free is the way to go.< /review>< resp>

Update: moved in today. Very easy. Karen was friendly and very helpful. The gate in and out was simple and easy to use. Facilities are extremely clean and well kept.

Renting the unit: It was very clean and renting was very easy. I reserved a space online, the manger gave me a call right away to set up a time to sign the lease. Very friendly service.< /Text>

Izumi was professional and helpful from the moment I walked into the office until I left. She was able to find discounts that had previously not been offered and a refund on renters insurance for the rest of the month without being prompted to look for them. She is someone that knows what customer service is and ensures the best possible outcome for all concerned. Izumi should be the manager of her own store sooner rather than later.</text>

They advertise on the web site and at the actual storage site "first month free" what they don't mention is "subject to availability" so only if they have the inventory??? False advertisement. If you don't have the inventory stop advertising this deal. So basically they decide who gets it and who doesn't. Speaking with customer service, every answer is generic. The lady working the front desk was very nice. Basically the only good thing about the process. Alsi advertising other deals online and I went through that channel and didn't get tjat advertised price.< /review>

<text>Let me tell you about the most wonderful customer service rep that I had the pleasure of helping me. Her name was Zoom and she was an angel! She was extremely busy and by herself but she made sure she recongized I was waiting and that she would be with me ASAP.

She went above and beyond in helping me find a storage unit for my needs and the process was incredibly smooth. In todays time when excellent customer service is hard to come by Zoom hit it out of the park.

You got a customer for life, even if I have to find stuff to put in storage!<//text>< date>

So i was on a short time schedule with locating a self storage unit for a furniture delivery. i had done my research and came to Extra Space Storage Britney was very patient and helpful she took the time to show me multiple available units and even researched online pricing for me to save money. int he end i felt very comfortable with them and she made it easy for me to decide if i wanted to go with them (no pressure) i am very happy with the assistance i was provided

as soon as you walk in the office the wonderful smell of a glade plug-in greats you, and makes you feel at ease<//text>

Extra Storage had been so awesome for my last storage which lasted 3 years, I'm  using them again for my home storage needs.
The units are clean, large, and well secured. And all my needs are met with a friendly smile and staff members ready to help.
I couldn't ask for anything better if I ran it myself.

Deserve a NO STAR....I had a storage here for about 2 years. After covid hit and I lost my job things were harder for me as a single mom it was hard to live. I got behind a couple of times but always managed to struggle to find a way to keepay my important things safe in storage. I had family out of state get sick and my grandpa passed. My father was also sick . so on December 11th I went in and talked to a girl I had never seen before. I said I know I am about 2 months behind but I am going to need a bigger storage I told her I was going back out of state to help my dad and I needed to insure my things were safe. She looked up my account asked for a current phone number that I gave  to her.Then after a few minutes she said she couldn't move my storage but because I was effected by covid I could take my whole storage for 1$ but the catch is I had to move it the day I wanted to take it. Knowing my situation it was a blessing.... I told her I could do that but I had no way to move it and I had to be in oklahoma in 2 days. She said she would note my account and not to worry about it . It would be fine till i got back. I left relieved and feeling greatful. I came back a bit later than expected as I lost my father to covid as well. The day after I got back into town I showed up with a truck and help to move my things and she told me they sold my things in auction 3 days after I talked to the girl. THE MANAGER had no answers or help. I literally lost everything and she had not one care like oops sorry there was no note. SHE was heartless everything I had is gone and there was no help from her nothing but I canrt help you. My things were stolen while I was Iaying my dad in the groundi will be seeking legal advice and I will never suggest this place to anyone. I want everyone to know they can't trust this place<//text>

Tamara was WONDERFUL!  I must say that I have worked with several different storage companies over the past year and without question ExtraSpace Storage has been the Best By FAR!! I use the North Highlands, CA location and Tamara was an Absolute STAR!!! not only was she able to show me the unit i needed, She was also able to re-Paint the curb all this while providing exceptional customer service. I hope you read this and use this location, Tell them Lee recommended you, and ask for Tamara, problem solved!!!<//Review>

I received late notice that i had to move out from where I was staying. I needed storage the same day and I didn't have much time. Public Storage was my first option, turned out they're prices were too high but most importantly,  the customer service wasn't pleasant at all. When I finally arrived at Extra Storage, the scent was very pleasant,  and Britny greeted me with a warm smile, and genuine service. She operated at an up beat pace and I loved it. I got a great deal. It didn't take long nor was it any confusion.  I'm very satisfied. Thanks Britny.</review>

< Review>
I went to this place earlier today and was very impressed by not only the cost of j their units, but also by the lovely Assistant Manager, Britney, that was there. I did a lot of price checking before hand and found that this place would be well within my budget for the size I was looking for.

I have a few stuff that I've got to hold for awhile and I figured  5x10 would do the job. After explaining everything I had she strongly recommended that I get a unit one size up. I'm very glad that I took her advise! I nearly filled up the one that I did get and I would have been very frustrated if I had gotten the smaller one. She saved me a lot of time, hard work and sweat with her knowledge of the units. Employees like her are the kind that every business should have and hold on to.< /Review>

This place is kinda run down, and our unit was broken in to and the trashed our storage. Where we had valuables and memories that are now gone or broken. The units our not kept up and your belongings get filthy inside the units. And they have raised our rent over $50 since we moved in which was only 18 months ago< /review>

They raise their rates like candy! Started out low and then they jack the prices up on you along the way! Long story short they will be losing my business shortly! Highly disappointed and likely to not recommend this company to anyone!< /text>

Nayrobi will be thrilled to hear this. Thank you again.'}< /Resp><text>Nayrobi met us immediately as we walked in.  We had been to other stores, but Mattress Firm had the largest selection.  He carefully guided us to help make a decision, asking which features were most important.  One significant thing he did was to keep us from exploring every available mattress as we would become overwhelmed.    He wisely kept guiding us to compare the last one we had seen with the next so that it was easier to make a decision.  Other customers came in, and he would greet them, but never lost track of what we were looking at or what our preferences were.

I had a great experience at Mattress Firm. My sales person was knowledgeable, efficient,  and super nice.
He listened to what I wanted and steered me in the right direction.
Everything went very smoothly.
I definitely would go back!<//review>

Nayrobi was an extraordinary Sales Associate, very knowledgeable, patient, thorough, and not pushy at all.  We tried many beds and his guidance helped us make the right choice.  He also provided a generous discount on the final price. An excellent experience!</Text>

Nayrobi was extremely helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bed for us. While he did try to sell us extra stuff (pillows, sheets, etc), he wasn't pushy about it when we decided we didn't want something. He got us a good deal on our items.

Delivery went well as well. The items were quickly brought in an set up for us. There was a slight problem with our order, in that the bunkie we bought was ordered in the wrong size. However, delivery staff was helpful in suggesting we reject the wrong size bunkie, and stating we should contact our sales person to get it fixed.

Nayrobi was extremely apologetic, and got the new items fixed and delivered within two days. I'm sure it would have been one had we contacted them as soon as we knew of the error.

Overall very happy with the staff that helped me with my purchase.</Text>

Nayrobi is a real professional, very knowledgeable and helpful, was not really trying to sell us anything but rather was focused on finding the mattress that suits us the most. Thank you for taking your time and staying 1hour late with us after the shop was closed to make sure we find out best fit. Highly recommend!< /review>

We had a great shopping experience this morning at this location. My wife and I really appreciated that the sales associate was knowledgeable about all the products and really helped us find an incredible deal. We were thankful it never felt like anyone was trying to upsell us to the premium mattresses, and really were helpful and patient to get us the best fit — fir both me and my wife. Stefany welcomed us warmly and was attentive, friendly, and supremely service-oriented. Probably the best Black Friday deal ever - 50% off the mattress, a free adjustable base and a mattress cover also at 50% off. We couldn’t have gotten have gotten this deal online based on our online research and I’m so glad we came into the store. We left feeling well-served and happy to walk away with such a sweet deal.</text>

Taleen was so helpful. She took each mattress down  from the mattresses stacked against the wall. I tried several.  She looked up all the info I asked and was polite and courteous.  My only regret was, when I called to order it the next day, she was off.
Great customer service !< /Text>

We had a fantastic experience that mattress firm earlier today! We were helped by Nayrobi and he was an absolute rock star! He's the store manager and had incredibly deep knowledge on a variety of mattresses. My wife and I shopped at several master stores and by far this was the best experience!<//Text>

My experience with Mattress Firm was beyond my expectations from start to finish!
In-store shopping with manager Nayrobi Rodriguez was great. He really knows his stuff! He was very professional, friendly, helpful, and made me feel safe in the store. He also was great at follow through, calling me the day of my delivery to check on everything. That was wonderful Customer Service on his part!
The team who delivered my new Tempur-pedic bed and took away my old mattress was awesome! They were incredibly fast, respectful, and had a great positive attitude the whole time, even though the building where I live made the job extra difficult. I can’t say enough great things about those guys!
I will definitely recommend Mattress Firm  San Carlos, CA to everyone I know.
Five Stars for sure!!</Text>

We had a great experience at MF.  We came in about 10 minutes before closing and the store manager, Lisa, really helped educate us on everything mattress related so we could make an informed decision.  She stayed late and answered all our questions.  Also, at no time did we feel any sales pressure, which I have felt so many times before when walking into a mattress store.  We ended up going with the Tempurpedic hybrid model, which came at a discount due to a Labor Day sale.  The other great thing is MF could have it to us quickly.  We lost our home in the CA Lightning Complex fires and needed to get it as soon as possible so we’d have somewhere to sleep.   I cannot even begin to describe the bliss I have thinking about sleeping in a nice bed again!<//review>

What was supposed to be a trip just to look at potential mattress for future purchase turned into us actually leaving with one. Everett is a genius! He made shopping for a mattress fun. Definitely makes it a fun experience. Having him help you pick a mattress will leave you knowing you got the best one for you.< /Text>

I went into this store twice, and had the same sales representative. We needed a bed badly since the just bought I was badly allergic to the memory foam. The chemical’s and gas were extremely  bad, and I didn’t know it was the bed for nearly 2 months.

I wanted to buy a really nice bed, and this sales representative knew nothing, low energy, and it felt like we were disturbing her. Sorry, I would never recommended going to this particular store in San Carlos.

I eventually went to Macy’s and the representative was awesome, and I’m very happy with my new bed!</review>

I am beyond thrilled with the new bed and pillows I purchased from Sleep Train! Shannon was my Salesperson and she was awesome. She was knowledgeable, patient and made the shopping experience fun. She had me try several options and her focus was always on me and my needs. My new bed and pillows were delivered the next day and I had a great experience with the delivery team as well. I highly recommend Sleep Train and I am a satisfied customer!< /Text>

Awesome service and great pricing!  We were going to buy online from Saatva but were worried about not being able to try it 1st.  Here we got to try them all, found the one we wanted (we wanted a higher end mattress), and ended up getting a slightly better price on top of it all.  Sweet!<//review>

<Text>My son peed  on my mattress and I couldn't get the stain out. I went to this mattress firm to get a comfy new one, and one of the employee really went above and beyond. Her name is Cherine. I work in customer service so I really appreciate it when other services realize that the customer comes first! Good job.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I went to the San Carlos Sleep Train and Shannon was absolutely amazing! After an entire day of searching for a new mattress (at 5 different stores..ugh) I landed at her store. She was so helpful in every way/ any way she possibly could be and wasn't pushy at all! Which is not something I can say for the other stores I went to and sales associates I encountered. Long story short, she is amazing and she helped me get the mattress I really wanted at a reasonable price. Thank you!!!< /text>

They even assisted my handicapped mother with trying  out mattress.  The store was very clean and they are were professional in answering all my questions and concerns  regarding my purchase.  I will recommend Mattress Firm  San Carlos to anyone, and will return there for future purchase.</review>< Pictures>

Very low pressure salesperson Sal asked us relevant questions and pointed us to the mattresses we would probably like most. He answered all of our questions and let us just look around without hounding us but was there when we needed him which I loved. We went to other places but eventually came back and got an amazing Serta hybrid medium iSeries 500 which we love! Sal really worked with our budget and got us a great deal. Highly recommended!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Update 5/3/18
Was promised a bed on 5/2 after we ordered on 3/31. Our delivery was cancelled with no explanation or communication with any management. Was told we’d get a call today (5/3) about a delivery tomorrow. I went in to the location and was told the warehouse was closed. We should be getting out mattress tomorrow but have no confirmation or help again from management. We were told no one ever set out mattress aside even though we placed the order over a month ago. This is incredibly frustrating because we’re paying for an apartment we can’t live in, paid for this mattress and still have nothing and no guarantee when it will show up.

Jason was extremely helpful and spent a lot of time helping us pick the right mattress. He was patient and made sure we were happy with the process as well as our purchase.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1525815358419, 'text': "Hi!

The Level of customer service that I received from Everette was outstanding. Everette explained the different between each mattress I tried Not only did I purchase a mattress I also learned a few things about mattresses. I will recommend my family and friends to Mattress Firm of San Carlos.
Thank you Everette and keep up the good work

My mattress arrived soft.  Eight months after purchase, my mattress sags to the extent that my spine sags and causes back pain, but the 5-yr warranty only covers mattress sagging to an extent that it is 1.5 inches lower in the middle than on the edges, without any weight on it.  The sides of my mattress also sag, to the extent of causing back pain.  My experience at Mattress Discounters has been worse than a loss for me, because I'm losing not only the money I spent but also the back health and problems caused by the mattress in the last 8 months.</text>< response>

<review>I HIGHLY recommend this store. Catilla Smith was our sales rep and I can't say enough good things about her. She was extremely knowledgeable about every mattress and we really felt as if she took the time to get to know each of our bodies so that she could recommend the right mattresses for us in our price range. We were not easy customers and she was extremely patient with us and honestly cared that we took our time and found the perfect mattress.

This was the 1st of 3 mattress stores my boyfriend and I went to look at mattresses. We hadn't done much research on pricing and had a gift card to a department store so we wanted to shop around a bit. The department store staff was terrible and compared to Catilla and their prices were too high even with our $200 gift card! We then went to a similar mattress store to Mattress Discounters. The staff in the other store didn't even compare to Catilla! We got a quote on one of the mattresses and it was a bit higher than Mattress Depot. We knew we could get them to beat Mattress Depot's price, but we were so happy with Catilla's customer service that we wanted to return and give her the business.

In the end we couldn't be happier with our purchase and the service we received from the entire Mattress Depot staff, but especially Catilla!!! We will definitely return for future business!<//review><user_id>106585767250066984942</user_id><resp>None< /resp>< time>

Second night sleeping on my mattress, and I'd already caught myself sorting and drooling! I don't remember the last time I'd slept so well. Thanks Everett for taking care of me! I don't imagine myself having to purchase another mattress anytime soon, but I'll for sure send all my friends and family your way!!< /review>

Great modern atmosphere. I mean everything about this place was great. The food was amazing, the staff was amazing and the decor was amazing. It feels good when the staff makes you feel welcome and appreciates your business. The only thing that is wrong is this place deserves a better location bc I feel like it’s hidden from the world and the parking sucks in this structure but don’t let that keep you away from this great place with great customer service< /Text>

<text>I got the salmon poking bowl and it was mind blowing delicious. Also very good size serving. Looks like the place was just recently remodeled and I definitely like how the wall is plastered with manga relating to food.</text>< Pics>

<review>This site is my favorite place.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this place. everytime  I I need a special lunch, this restaurant comes first to my mind. fresh and all sorts of  food and a rich cuisine.courteous staff members, and great mood. In addition to that, the charge is modest. I suggest this spot with no doubt.<//review>< Date>

The food is fresh, tastes great and not to expensive for a quick bite that satisfies and doesn't load you down after with regret< /Text>

Went here for the 1st time. Good food, the chicken a little fatty, but good flavor.<//text>

<Text>Good, fresh food.  Friendly service.  Good pricing on their bowls and you can add an appetizer and drink and make it a combo.  Tried the noodle bowl with tofu, and the noodles were a little too sweet for me (I absolutely LOVED the spring rolls).  Next time I'll do a salad or rice bowl instead.</Text>< pictures>

Light and healthy. If you are looking for something heavier, you may want to look elsewhere. Bowls are generally heavier on lettuce, and lighter on meat and rice.< /review>

This place I think is new, it has grand opening signs in the front, so I figured I would give it a shot. I ordered the salmon poke Bowl... I personally did not enjoy it, they charge you $11 for a little handful of salmon and the rest of my lunch I can barely pick through, I've been to a lot of these places and this one by far is not my favorite</Review>

The toilet I had purchased on my own ended up having a crack in the tank. I no longer have a vehicle large enough to transport the toilet properly so Dakota put it in his van and helped me get it exchanged. The store did not have the stock it was supposed to and other locations also could not physically verify the stock they showed. Dakota and Raul negotiated a significant discount with the store on a better model that was in stock. This all took extra effort and time that was not part of the quote but the final price was not adjusted. If Dakota represents the average service technician at HomeX, then I would highly recommend them to anyone. I normally only give service or product reviews when I am not happy with my purchase. I always expect good service when I pay for it and don't feel obligated to giving a good rating. But when I get service that makes me feel like I got a special deal, I actually want to give a great review and will be bragging about the deal to others.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Great experience with this place. They really went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied with the service. I was really surprised. All the techs were very nice and the owner actually came and explained the service also. I had my water heater converted to tankless. Will definitely be using this place for any future plumbing issues and recommending to my friends.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Today was the day I discovered HomeX Plumbing and am I amazed at the efficiency this company is run!!! ... 1st of all the appointment desk when you call in is FANTASTIC = constant communication via text AND phone call... 2nd let’s talk about Andrew the plumber that arrived — in uniform, friendly, fast and a real expert! ..I always ask the employees if the company they work for treats them well and Andrew said this company is THE BEST to work for!!! I LIKE THAT a lot..... and lastly — upfront great pricing and no attempt to sell me on other things — YOU should make HomeX your family plumber!!!! YAY< /Review>

Shane & Andrew removed/replaced all 6 of my faucets, together with all 16 angle shut off valves. And as can be expected, found a few difficulties with such a large project. Shane and Andrew both completed the project with an outstanding professionalism, and outstanding customer service, and took the 'difficulties' in stride, solving them with ease. I definitely recommend HomeX Plumbing & Rooter, and will call on them for my future needs.< /text>

HomeX was super-responsive, calling back almost instantly and making an appointment within a very near time window.  Then they called back and offered service even sooner.  The 2 man team who arrived were personable, competent, and polite.  They took care of things quickly and satisfactorily.  I appreciated being able to once again  use the shower without fighting the control.  Thanks, HomeX.</Text>

The guys at Homex did a great job of repairing all my water pipes. They went above and beyond to ensure I got my plumbing up and running as quickly as possible. Fabian, Andrew, Niko and Shane all did an excellent job. Very professional and very helpful. I will definitely use Homex for everything moving forward.< /Review>

<Text>Originally I thought I had a more serious problem but it turned out that was not the case. However I did have a smaller problem with our enclosed shower. Juan sent over Andrew a very pleasant young man who did the job very efficiently. My wife and I were very pleased with the work done and would not hesitate to use
Homex again if needed.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I requested a quote only for a tankless water heater and water heater. My wife and I were weighing our options before the old unit we have goes out when we need it most. The company was very responsive and professional. They called prior to showing up, provided a picture of the technician (Ismael), and Ismael wore a mask during the entire visit. Ismael also answered all of my questions and provided an electronic written quote for my request. This was an estimate only. If I were to do the work, this company would be a strong contender for the job.<//Text>< response>

Shane was our plumber that was dispatched to our house. We were experiencing a small leak but was unsure where it was coming from. Shane was VERY helpful in explaining what his process is to determine the issue and what the estimated cost would be. Luckily the resolution seems to be minor. Thank you Shane for being so helpful in explaining everything. You're very knowledgeable and have great customer service. I definitely recommend HomeX Plumbing.<//text>

Great company to work with.  All the employees (on the phone and in person) have a caring attitude.  Helpful and attentive.  The technician even waited at the store to help me make sure I got the correct part.  He gave me several options.  No pressure just explanation of each option.  Nice and friendly.  Made sure everything was working properly and cleaned up before he left.  Hard to find a good company these days.  I will use them the next time I need plumbing work done.<//review>

<review>Tech came to diagnose a pilot light that wouldn’t stay lit on a 10 year old water heater. After discussing the possible solutions and the cost associated with replacing parts on an old water heater, we decided it was a better option to replace. No aggressive sales tactics or pressure. The tech arrived promptly the following morning, removed the old heater, installed the new one and made some code-specific improvements. Process took around 2 hrs and they left my garage in better shape that they found it. Highly recommend.<//review>< Gmap_id>

ALL of them were kind, considerate of our concerns and showed integrity in their business dealings.🙂 We are SO THANKFUL to have use of our kitchen sinks, again, and confident they'll be functioning better than ever before after the caring, detailed work HomeX did for us! They wore masks and respected our trying to keep safe distance from them as we have been quarantined for almost 6 months, now, due to my husband being VERY high risk. They were, also, very thoughtful in keeping as quiet as possible while they worked as two of our family members were sleeping.😴😌 Thank you all so much for everything!

Very responsive staff.  Easy to set up an appointment and provided an ETA on day of appointment.  Needed the kitchen sink flange hooked up to our garbage disposal replaced.  Our technician Cesar Rosa arrived on time was polite, professional, explained what needed to be done, and provided a reasonable cost estimate. The work was accomplished even though it was not as easy to remove and reinstall the garbage disposal due to the limited amount of spacing around the sealing bracket.  Cesar left the work area clean and took photos of the finished work.  Would definitely recommend this company.</Review>

He had very slow drains in our washing machine, kitchen sink and bathtub. We looked on Google and found HomeX. The price was what got us to call but the service and professionalism is what will bring us back! Our plumber Daniel was friendly, professional, on time, and just a pleasure to have in our home. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for or more likely needing a plumber. 😁</Text>

I realize I have never once wondered when they'd be here, who would be there, or had to follow up.  They reach out to me first.  Ceasar was great. But I missed my boy Daniel.

Within minutes of submitting my request, their office called me and gave me an appointment that morning. The office updated me with exact arrival time of 9:05 am after they had given me the time frame of 9 am to 11 am. They emailed me with the technicians info and picture. Daniel was punctual, polite and through. Answered all my questions and explained the fix I needed as well as made other recommendations. Would recommend this company highly.</review>

myself i had a new faucet already.
for the installer he did a good job.
but there pricing is way to high for the work they did.
$ 345.00 to change a Faucet and one 1/2 valve. way over price.
the valve cost round $ 12, there labor rate is is around $ 150 per hr.
needless to say i will not be hiring them again.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I was at a loss for a trustworthy and competent plumber.  I found Homex through my Nextdoor App and took the plunge.  What a relief!  Alvino was polite, conscientious, explained each process in detail and did a clean, wonderful job.  He went out of his way to accommodate us.  Homex office communicated each arrival and delay so that I wasn’t left waiting and wondering.  Shane also went over all options and pricing on the spot.

My technicians Ismael and Viktor were very professional and capable. They arrived, quickly inspected the pipes, gave reasonably priced estimates, and completed the work all within a couple hours.

The technician came on time,  was very professional,  prepared with mask, and explained everything before he started the job.   After investigating the leak he explained thoroughly how he came to his conclusion to what was required.   Unfortunately,  the work needed is much bigger than what he can do, so he provided references as well.   Overall great experience.   Will call him again if needed in future.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Got a next-day appointment on a big holiday weekend; Ismail was great and left the area spotless when he was done. I’d absolutely call this plumber again.

(One year later:) This is the second time this company has saved our bacon. Shane and Andrew did a fantastic job clearing and fixing up our sink drains, in the process fixing up some problems that had been introduced by another plumber we'd unfortunately had out first. Very professional, very knowledgeable, they fixed the problems, explained their work well, and left the place spotless. We will absolutely use HomeX again, and next time we'll call them FIRST.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1575933595559, 'text': 'Hello Brian,\nI am so glad that we were able to provide 5 star service to you on such a busy holiday weekend, we are so proud to have Ismael on our team here at HomeX Plumbing.

The HomeX gentleman went above and beyond the call of duty. They were professional, on time, and amazing to work with. The job took much longer than anticipated, and they still had such a wonderful attitude.  The team of Jeremy, Juan, and Henry were absolutely amazing. I highly recommend,  and will be using their services again for other needs in my house. Thank you HomeX!!!!</Review>

<Text>I did research with 10 different companies and HomeX offered the best quotes for a garbage disposal replacement. Ismael arrived on time with a great attitude. While messing around with the old unit, he actually ended up finding the issue and showed me how it was fixed so I could do it myself in the future (where everyone else said it couldn’t be done).
Ismael saved me a lot of money and trouble, and I would not hesitate to call him again for help in the future.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>The team that came to work on my piping were very professional.  Even though they arrived a bit late the work they did made up for it. I wish i would have received a courtesy call before or with in the scheduled arrival time as made aware. I was called 10 minutes after my arrival window.

<Review>When I called to schedule an estimate, the lady in the phone was very professional and courteous.  A gentleman from the company arrived the same day and within a couple of hours.  When he arrived, he was very kind and professional.

After giving me a reasonably priced estimate, he asked for my permission to start the job.  He kept me well informed throughout the process.  In addition, he was very clean and was careful throughout his stay.  Lastly, I greatly appreciated him treating my house with much respect by not leaving the front door open every time he needed to go to his truck for tools.

Long story short, the service was outstanding and was completed promptly.  What really impressed me was his professionalism towards me and respect for my house.  I would rate the overall experience with an A+.  I normally don’t take the time to write reviews; however, I felt a moral obligation to go out of my way to express my satisfaction with this great company and gentleman.

I look forward to calling them again in the future.< /Review>< Pics>

I can highly recommend HomeX after two house calls. Technician Juan and Frances over the phone are both extremely polite, professional, and efficient. They communicate well regarding appointment times, and they did not push extra services we didn't need. They also followed up after the visit to make sure we were still satisfied. Definitely keeping this place in mind for any future plumbing needs!</Review>

<text>I had a minor kitchen sink leak. The technician arrived promptly, did a thorough examination, and identified the cause. Best of all, he informed me of three options ranging from $9 for a DIY sealer application to installation of a new garbage disposal, which I could also purchase myself to save on the cost if the tech had to purchase. I appreciated the honest opinions, and will try the DIY approach first. If unsuccessful or if I have future needs, I’ll call HomeX.< /text>< pictures>

Henry was fantastic! He arrived the exact time they told me he would arrive.
Before even entering our house he put shoe covers over his shoes, I was impressed. He checked out our toilet problem, found the part, picked it up and brought it back and fixed it. I think he was pretty reasonable. He was very clean and did the job promptly. I would use them again.<//review>

We are so happy Shane was able to fix the issue and deliver that 5 star service that you deserve. Thank you for choosing HomeX Plumbing & Rooter.'}<//Resp><Review>I have a difficult time with trust. And with plumbing, you often hear so many words and jargon that mean nothing to me about the problems with the pipes in my house. With Shane, he really tried to explain things to me in a way I could understand. He walked me through the process and he developed trust with me early with a smaller project where he did everything he could not to charge the higher price and he did it successfully even though it might have taken a bit more work on his end.

When he had to break the news to me that there was a problem with the main line, he didn’t just tell me, he explained it with the camera and showed me everything. Even though the job ended up being way more than I thought, the end result was amazing. Shane came back to make sure he showed me everything that was done with the camera again and it  definitely put my mind to ease. He even went above and beyond on a miscommunication we had and helped with a sink and shower issue. He did not have to do that, but thats the type of guy Shane is. I cant say that all plumbers are the same but Shane got my trust and if I ever have issues I will request him.<//Review>< userid>

The plumber was prompt. He clearly explained all possible repairs needed, all cost for installation, and all possible options to meet our needs. The was no high pressure sales. He more than once asked if we were sure on the type of service we wanted knowing clearly the cost. He was professional, polite, and friendly. I would recommend this company to others.</Review>

<text>This morning I was finally fed up with the two toilets in our house that weren’t working properly. They still flushed and were useable but the constant running water and weird noises were just too much. I got some recommendations from Angie’s list and the first business to call was HomeX Plumbing &Rooter. They had a time open in the afternoon and I booked it. Henry came within the time frame given and looked at the problems, gave me an estimate I could live with and got the work done so quickly. He and his assistant were neat. They cleaned up after they were done. I could not have asked for more! Thank you so much Henry and HomeX for a job well done!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

We had a Slab leak and unable to get a neighborhood plumber to come out until 4 days later, we found our God sent plumbers on Angie's List. We couldn't be more pleased that we found Homex !! Francis in the office is always so cheerful and made it feel I was talking to family. She kept me updated on arrival times and answered any questions I had. The plumbers headed by Juan are more than knowledgeable, polite, clean, and go above and beyond to explain everything honestly so you understand exactly what is being done and why. Our job turned into a total nightmare , just because as the leak was found and fixed other things that definitely needed our attention came to light. Juan and the Homex team really stepped up and helped relieve the stress I was feeling and resolved all the new things with the utmost professionalism.  They have truly earned a customer for life here and I have and will continue to refer my family and friends their direction without any hesitation at all !!  Thank you Francis, Juan, Jose 1, Jose 2, Adrian, George, and the others that got my home back in shape, you guys are the bomb !!

Great experience!  I’ve had a leaky outdoor hose bib for several months.  I contacted my son who had some plumbing done at his house.  He strongly recommended HomeX and Juan specially.  I contacted Homex who had Juan come for an estimate within a couple of hours. Juan was very friendly and professional.  He walked up with booties in hand to protect my floor.  This told me right away that he was not only professional but respectful of my home. He inspected my situation and explained what he could do for me without being pushy.  He gave me a very reasonable price before he left. After checking with my wife, I called back right away and set up an appointment for the next day (Saturday).
Juan was on time and ready to go.  He immediately turned the water off and began his repair.  Juan was very knowledgeable and efficient doing a very clean professional job.  He made sure everything was perfect before he left and reminded me of the 90 day warranty. He also offered his service if I had any questions about plumbing in the future.
I finally found a reliable plumber I can trust.
I highly recommend Juan and HomeX for any plumbing needs.
Thank you Juan and HomeX.</text>

My wife and I were interested in adding an additional water bib in our backyard so that we could hook up a hose.  This job involved rerouting our drip irrigation system and attaching a water bib to the side of the house.

We had a great experience with HOMEX!  Juan answered the phone and helped setup our estimate appointment for the next day.  Shortly after I setup our appointment, I received a confirmation email and a text confirmation the day of our appointment.  The text confirmation provided the name and picture of the person that was going to come out to the house.  I appreciated knowing who was going to be coming out.

When he arrived, Juan came in a truck that clearly stated the name of the company and he was dressed in the company uniform.  Juan took a look at our current situation, listened to what we wanted done and  clearly explained three different options.  One being the most cost effective, a second being a little more expensive, and a third that would have been really high end.  He explained that given everything that I told him, he would recommend going with the most cost effective option.  Throughout the whole process, I didn't feel pressured or rushed to make a decision.  I asked for a little time because I wanted to talk to my wife about the options and the job.  Again, I didn't receive any pressure.

I called back later that evening and scheduled an appointment to have the job completed.  Juan came back out and went over the options again to make sure that the job was going to meet our expectations.  Again, I didn't feel pressured and he never tried to encourage me to add on things that I didn't need such as replacing our existing pvc pipe or drip irrigation system.

Juan was extremely fast and he explained the steps before he started.  When he was finished, he showed us the completed job and gave us recommendations on maintaining the area.  Juan was professional and he did an excellent job of cleaning up the area.  I would definitely recommend HOMEX.</review>

< Review>
I went on a Thursday after work during happy hour and I looked it a lot. The bar is clean and stocked with craft beers and a decent liquor selection. The staff and regulars were friendly. We had some wounds which hit the spot, we were only sad that they ran out of pretzels when we went. Unfortunately I couldn't stay for Karaoke on this day but I have been in the past before it got remodeled about 2 years ago and it was super fun.< /Review>

One of my favorite Karaoke Bars in West LA, for sure. Unfortunately, do to Covid-19 there won't be Karaoke for a while. However, they do have outdoor seating available right now. I still enjoying going there because their entire staff is so friendly, prices are right, and the their food is so good! I have been going there for over 5 years and I honestly have nothing to complain about. If you're going to check out BW 11 (the local nickname) for the first time, keep in mind that you may need some patience to find parking if you're not going to take a Lyft or Uber. They are in a little corner plaza so the parking can be very limited from time to time. Lately because of the pandemic, it's been very easy to find parking.

Side note: When they do open back up to full capacity, you'll want to get there early to put you name on the list to sing, that place gets packed! Lol<//text>

Place has always been amazing. Haven't been here in two years... and still one of best places I've eaten. Prices are a little tiny bit more then your avg sushi place, but not loaded with rice. Plenty of fish which is what we come for! Double yellow tail is amazing, uni with quail egg is amazing and hand rolls are amazing once again not overloaded with rice. If you get salmon skin you get plenty, if you get scallops you get plenty. Worth the price, hospitality is amazing, and place is always clean...< /text>

Every glowing word of praise preceding my review was also my experience. My husband and I and another couple raved about every aspect of the evening the entire ride home. I'm trying to think when the last time was that happened. We cannot wait to go back and finish trying everything on the menu and to see some live music. We were amazed how we could hear each other and the music perfectly but not one conversation happening around us. The decor, the food, the wine, the service were all simply perfect. Do yourself a favor and go family style - share as many different dishes as you can. Each one marvels and lingers. Bravo!!!!<//Review>

First time here and had a great experience! Their rolls were delicious and the garlic edamame was so saucy & flavorful. The staff was wonderful and made sure we were doing okay. We went during lunch hour so the parking wasn't too bad. I'm not sure how the parking is  during dinner time. It's a small parking lot. I think I might have found my go to sushi spot in LC! Overall I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be coming back!< /review>

<Text>But there is one bar to go to that it feels like home, and I could spend all day.... and it's the Shamrock.  The people are always awesome... it is very much a community bar.  The place is quaint with lots of random, assorted seating.... but here is why it is one of the best in the city:< /Text>< date>

In no time I was handed a cute mason jar glass with hot water, freshly squeezed lemon, and some agave to sweeten it up. I was beyond grateful and even when I was half way done I was offered a refill. I know I may be biased but I'm sure their alcoholic drinks are just as good :)</text></record>

Boardwalk 11 GASTROPUB and Karaoke ever been a very loyal place for 20+ years of special events and intimate dining with my family they have places that you would never see in any other restaurant where every dining experience is different from the last especially their wine room which is only one table but you cannot be any more intimate than that special spot the bar and the bartenders and the staff are the best and I travel a lot... Looking for some Prime rib, New York steak ,and our favorite Molly salad prawn cocktail and fish and chips...This place nestled in the foothills aren't going away ,first bite you'll know what I mean ,thank you for listening</Text>

<text>Best place to ring in a Friday night. I love the cozy, casual vibe of this bar. It's also conveniently located in the Montrose shopping lane so there is plenty of parking (huge free lot in the back). I absolutely love the food here. I've tried probably everything on the menu and have loved it all. My favorites are the sausage platter, the burger (with bacon and guacamole added), the bacon wrapped hot dog, and the bacon mac n cheese (clearly I love bacon lol). There are always a bunch of beer options and a ton of delicious cocktails. I also love that there are TVs everywhere and they show all the football games on Sundays! There is always some sporting event playing which is just perfect for me. It gets very packed on Friday nights but it's the perfect place to have that first drink of the weekend.</text>< pics>

<Text>Love this place. Upstairs/downstairs. I believe it's a Boardwalk 11 GASTROPUB and Karaoke? But bartenders are all Irish. Super good service. Trivia night (which I don't attend), good atmosphere for Football games on TV, and within stones throw of 4 other bars. Food seems to be mediocre at best. But I don't think it's a destination for grub, just helps keep you there. 4 stars for sure though.</Text>< pics>

Great speakeasy that is an awesome spot for whiskey drinkers and cocktail connoisseurs at a reasonable price. Most affordable place to get Macallan 12 if you're into scotch - also, it is definitely a fun, diverse karaoke spot if you're drunk enough. Ample seating provided in the backroom that is fantastic when you're just looking to chill out after work. Food is surprisingly tasty and above average for an upscale dive bar.</Text>

<time>1580186477559</time><user_name>Ziggy Kruse< /user_name><Review>Boardwalk 11:

My husband and I were looking for a venue that offers fun, food and a good space to entertain our friends and family for an evening to celebrate his retirement and my birthday.

As usual, we went online, did a search for those types of TAGS and came across Boardwalk 11.

We looked at most of the 500+ reviews already posted, including the negative ones. Some of those are really serious: Cold old food, roaches, bad service, etc.

Most people may have been persuaded to not even consider this place, but we thought: Can it really be THAT BAD?

The answer is NO! – We went the same day we did our research, parked in the parking lot (which is free valet [translation: If you eat or drink, incl. non-alcoholic drinks you only need to consider tipping the valet]), went inside and we started to look around.

The place was almost empty, but it was just a little after 6:30 PM on a Tuesday. There was a clear friendliness between patrons, bartender, server and newcomers like us.

We sat down near the bar, got a menu and were surprised about the prices as those are pretty competitive to other places.

Even though we felt “adventurous”, both of us ended up with the same dish: BBQ Chicken Tostada Salad. The shell was crispy, the salad fresh and the chicken tender. – It was good.

Still, having some of those negative reviews in mind, I kept looking for anything that would gross me out. I didn’t see anything. No Roaches, no bugs of any kind. In fact, the entire place was clean, inviting, and fun.

Our server also managed to bring the owner over to us. Which was nice, as I kept thinking about the negative review he got and I expected to meet a grumpy, old, unkempt, mean, horrid person. He is not.

Steve introduced himself and started chatting with us about the venue. He is open minded, courteous, and funny.

Even though things may change in the future, but for right now, and based on our first impression, we are looking forward to our little celebration at Boardwalk 11.</Review>< pictures>

<text>I am so disappointed in this place. I came here because of the show and it went all down hill. Display and everything was great and the music but the food has gone downhill. I seen roaches crawling and I feel like it just got more terrible over time. The most horrific experience happened when I found a small bug in my food. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!<//text><user_id>104598347615613183079< /user_id>< response>

If you don't like small bars and are impatient , don't come here stay home! I always compare other Boardwalk bars to Boardwalk because I'm so damn loyal to them and nothing compares to this family owned business .It truly is the best damn Boardwalk bar to me.<//Review>

They have solid daily drink specials and have tapas/cheese boards at hand. The bartenders are fast and friendly with service and it never seems to get obnoxiously over-crowded.

Bonus: not overpriced like neighboring bars.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I used to come here A LOT and back then I would give it five stars.
Something has changed recently

Focus should be on the customer experience and the service should be welcoming, friendly and fun.  just my two cent.

Weird service on the past few visits.< /Review><Time>1564093801827< /Time><Name>Jason Harrold< /Name>< gmap_id>

<text>The food was good a bit pricey but good 👌. I ordered chicken wings, a side of fries and a Sprite. My bill was $20! I didn't even get a drink yet lol. I was hoping that all the menu items wasn't itemized but it's not a big deal. The staff is awesome.
When it comes to the Karaoke part it was cool.  The DJ needed to play a better mix of songs in between the participants.  Other than that I had fun. Nice crowd of people. Whether you sang the house down or sucked you were welcomed.< /text>< response>

< Review>
Well let's start this review off, positively. The bar is doing just fine. The food is amazing. Guys are you serious? Reality T.V shows like hell and back are all staged, I was there when they were filming, it's all staged. Have you guys forgot that? Gordan does this to make money, he doesn't care about the owners, he works with thousands with them, thats too much to care about for him. The food is made there on the spot. Their burgers are the best I've ever tasted, better than In and Out, and that's a really bold statement that I wouldn't be making if I didn't believe in it.

I don't work for them, I wasn't paid by them, hell I could care less if they did all the bad things that Gordan's team staged, but they don't do the things, so it pisses me off to the bone to see random people who never stepped foot in the bar to give it a 1 star review and say all these rude and hateful things. Remember how we were taught to never judge a book by it's cover huh? Well, you're doing it here, knock it off guys<//Review>

<Review>If you love karokee this is the place. Karokee everyday. The best thing about this bar was the service. My bartender/ server/ rockstar made my experience here memorable. She knew about everything. The drinks, the food, the best songs to sing, the traffic, thank you endlessly Myla you are their biggest asset.</Review>< pics>

This place is horrible. Food was nasty and tasted old. Wish I could give 0 stars. My husband got food poisoning. The owner is the lowest of low humans. Has no respect. Doesn't do anything but act like a jerk. Save yourself and NEVER even think about going. You can karaoke somewhere way better I promise.< /review>

Came here about two months ago, the drinks were good the staff seem disconnected. The food was mediocre at best. The restaurant was dirty and I'm afraid to see what the kitchen looks like. I didn't realize that this was on a Gordon Ramsay show which now makes it more of a disappointment</Text>

Recommend the French fries but that’s it. Ordered the wings, it was obviously microwaved but poorly done, as they were hot on the outside and frozen once we bit into it.

I've walked past this place like a million times but never went in until just recently.  Imagine my surprise when I saw how clean, intimate and classy the establishment was.  It's a perfect place to bring a date or a small group of friends for local craft beer, good food and watching people sing their favorite karaoke songs.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant-bar to others and would come back again.  I knocked off a star due to it's utter lack of parking.  However, for those who happen to live in the area, it is the quintessential neighborhood bar experience and would encourage others in the Palms area to check it out.  A perfect venue for a date.</text>

Most of the VJs are pretty good... the one last night kept putting other people in front of us... overall the staff is friendly, and the crowd is pretty good.  There are some pretty good singers here.  But, people please choose appropriate songs...You have you choose songs that the crowd will enjoy.   Just because you like  singing show tunes from The Little Mermaid in your shower does not mean it's a good karaoke song...< /Review>

I went here to enjoy a karaoke night with a new friend and got a table near the karaoke host and close to the stage. The place itself was nice enough. Lots of comfortable seating. Good sound system. Nice branded stage with good lighting. They had a charging station but I ended up grabbing an outlet closer to my table to charge my phone.

It was St. Patrick's Day so my friend and I both ordered green beers which were featured on the menu. Basically they were green versions of Miller Light which worked for us.

We both put songs in with the karaoke host immediately upon arrival and settled in at our table to look through the karaoke book with our green beers. It was posted that we could only put one song in at a time so that's what we did. I was told the wait to sing was about an hour and a half. Not being terribly long we patiently waited our turns while being entertained by the other performers.

Two and a half hours and four beers later my friend and I had still not been invited up to sing yet and I would soon have to head home to get some sleep for work the next day so I asked the karaoke host again if he could work us into the lineup soon. He said we were 7 songs away.  That would be another half an hour! 3 hours wait to sing one song??!! Which would have been twice his original estimate of one and a half hours. That was ridiculous and not ok.

Now mind you I watched certain performers get up there 2 or three times throughout the night while we waited to sing once. I am certain that the karaoke hosts math was not off when he gave the earlier time estimate but seemed to not value our time or have any integrity whatsoever and just put others before us time after time after time to add another 1.5 hours of singers between our first songs.

In the end I paid the bill and left after waiting 2.5 hours. Very dissatisfied.< /review>

1) It has valet parking
2) spacious and a set up that makes sense Regarding tables, booths and the karaoke stage.
3) countless song selection!
4) atmosphere was great. Maybe it was a lucky night but the crowd was awesome!
I had a great time. Looking forward to going back.<//Review>

One of my favorite places. Good crowd and great food and drinks. Come early though, the wait to sing can get LONG!< /text>

<Review>The DJ put up with me requesting songs all night. Was I being obnoxious? maybe. Was it my birthday, so who cares? Yup. My friends and I all had a blast.</Review>< pics>

Good food and drinks but not welcome to newcomers singing. We waited two hours and our song request never came on. Yet a few 'regulars' went up to sing multiple times.  Will definitely not go to this bar again.< /Review>

Was curious to see how business was after seeing the show. Owner obviously knows more than Ramsay. I would normally never review a place without experiencing it but after reading the asinine replies of the owner I see he represented himself accurately on camera and couldn't not leave a comment. Instead of being a passive aggressive coward that pretends to take advice, just stand up like a man and say you're not interested. But you couldn't pass up a free renovation, eh? Hell, your own father talks negatively about you. Must be embarrassing for him to create a successful template and be ignored by his "sharp as a marble" son.

Find a smaller location with no kitchen and focus on the area that earns the quality reviews. Good beer and karaoke. Hard to screw that up.<//Text>

Watched the ‘Gordon Ramsey 24hrs to Hell and Back’ so I was curious how this place is surviving. I hope both Kats will get a better job offer elsewhere. This is by far the most undeserving place. I would certainly not support this restaurant with an owner that doesn’t respect women, re-hire guys who bad mouth women & demoted staff who has potential to grow. Guys, just stop supporting this place & I hope the food is still fresh...<//Text>

Great ambiance, it's not a private room type karaoke bar but one large stage for everyone to perform on. Staff is friendly, I didn't order any food so can't speak to that, ambiance was fun, lively and inviting.</Text>

This is the very best karaoke establishment: Employees are positive, upbeat & energetic, and they actually remember you after being there ONE TIME only. Food is delicious, fresh, hot & reasonably priced. Huge selection of karaoke tunes. Sound system sounds rich and full, and the weekday kJ KNOWS HOW TO MIX so you sound great. I think ALL of this contributes to the most important part of the experience overall: EVERY time we’ve gone, the audiences are validating, supportive, and always enthusiastically encouraging of singers, which makes this place THEE very best K establishment. FIVE + STARS<//Review>

Fun place to celebrate an event by people watching, or singing Karaoke! Wide variety of food and alcohol in a lively environment! Valet parking cost is whatever you want to pay them, which is cheaper than the parking meters near. Friendly staff; bathrooms on premises. Wheelchair accesible.<//review>

It's sad because I was coming to town with a large group and many of us are into food and spend money but expect great food and service to match the bill. I have no confidence to even come here. The owner rehired a perv, demoted the best cook there, demoted a great oriented customer service manager Kat. It's sad, after a few of us seen the show we voted down this restaurant as a go to place. An easy $4,000 with a big group coming into town. Both kat and kat should apply at a high end restaurant and be appreciated.</Review>

The atmosphere was ridiculously fun but I guess that depends on the crowd. The dj was energetic and kept the crowd fires up. Great music selection.
Would have been 5 stars but my drink was never refilled and the waitress didn't even ask me for my order to begin with.<//Review>

Earlier review (8 months ago): A great bar, stellar beer list, and friendly staff!

Update: I'm not sure what happened, but service was horrible my last two visits - slow and inattentive. Today, I gave up and went to Irish Times around the corner. Too bad, because I like the bar and the owner, Steve.<//Text>

No cover charge
Nice lounge area
Fries are bomb here FYI
Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't as crowded as I'd expect it to be
Drinks are kind of pricey ($13 for jameson shot)
This place is good for large groups since it's pretty open and spacious
One bathroom available for each gender< /Text>

The best sound system, song choice and nicest staff in any karaoke bar. My favorite place to sing and goof off after long weeks of hard work.

[ APPENDED ] Boardwalk 11 was recently featured in Gordon Ramsay's "24 Hours of Hell". I hope people will understand that the caricature of this establishment in that show was purely for entertainment, and NOT the real place. This gastropub is STILL amazing and so are the people there.< /Text>

After Seeing this restaurant on TV I thought my family would try it out visiting family, I would give this Restaurant 0 Stars if i could but, The Place was dirty during Dinner hours, the place smelled of a odor I cannot repeat on here just Smelled like Kaka......I ordered sliders and the meat and veggies on it taste sour...I sent it back and they made me another but still the taste was there, my brother ordered fries that was cold and hard.....this Restaurant seems like they do not care, they care more about the people at the bar then the people there ordering food.........,< /Text>

< review>
I'm so sad.. I love to support local small dive bars, and this spot is super awesome. But tonight,.First of all, the prices are a little steep for what kind of bar this is.  It's a dumpy bar in a strip mall in the middle of Palms - everything should be cheap, but it's not.  I haven't been there lately, but they used to have a two drink minimum on weekend nights.  If you're not careful with what you order, those two things can add up to a pretty serious tab.

Second, I personally think the crowd here is pretty annoying.  I know people love that there are "regulars" here, but I kind of get tired of seeing the same people sing the same stuff every time I'm there.  The big groups that come here e.g. offices parties or bachelorette parties (the worst) can get quite annoying.  Although, this is probably not something unique to Boardwalk 11.

But, the main problem with this place is that on the weekend, the wait can easily be two hours (I've seen longer).  It's kind of tough to sit through people butchering songs for 2+ hours just so you can finally get your one song in.  Also, as I think maybe someone alluded to, the big groups that are there seemingly never have a problem getting their songs in.  Based on what I've seen, I think it's pretty safe to say that there's some shenanigans going on with the waiting list</review>

<review>Good food, awful service. Waited 15 minutes for drink at the bar. Seems if you are not a regular, you are ignored. We were a goup of 4. Gave 2 of us wrong burgers at table service, but begrudgingly corrected their error. Two of my friends went back last week and had problems with the same waitress who claims to have been there for 2 years.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Surprising that I never wrote a review of Boardwalk 11 - although there's probably a reason for that:  Got 86'd here a while back after killing it on the karaoke stage.  Unfortunately, I do tend to skew pretty highly on the megalomania scale, and basking in the raucous applause of the four or five other barflies in the building after finishing "Time is Running Out" I triumphantly dropped the mic (literally) on to the stage...

The DJ seemingly took umbrage at my antics because before I knew it, he called out to assorted staff to escort me out of the premises to rueful laughter from the crowd...  Eh, I don't blame him, I would've done the same thing were I in his place.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2bbcb99c2200f:0xd87a5214846753a3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They seemed to have quite a few bad. But later in the evening it was more enjoyable as more better singers arrived. Prices for food were pretty good. Drinks a bit high for my liking, but for LA reasonable. The KJ started catering to his regulars. Our waitress noticed it and while she had no control over what the KJ does. Got the issued resolved quickly. Other than a small incident this was the one the best Karaoke experiences I've had in LA. With good food reasonable prices and great Karaoke. I didn't understand why this place wasn't packed. On the top ten list for best Karaoke. It should have been much higher on the list.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbcb99c2200f:0xd87a5214846753a3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm not just the weekend karaoke host. I'm also a customer.

The new Breaker 22 kitchen menu is absolutely tops, and before we all begin scrambling to get a chance at the mic each night at 8pm the dining atmosphere is very chill and relaxing.

Now open for breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays at 10am!< /text>

I will be back!! 😃 Thank you for making my birthday awesome!!

This place saved the day when I had to swiwtch my venue last minute. They allow birthday cakes to be brought in & they'll sing Happy Bday & have the whole bar join in! The staff here is incredible! They made it a fun special night with great drinks, food & stage! The song selection & sound equipment are excellent too!

But be warned! This place has got talent!!! I've never seen so many talented singers in a karaoke bar (but it is LA, so...)! It wasn't extremely busy (on a Thursday) so my group was able to sing 4-5 times throughout the night & the crowd had an amazing supportive energy so even if you're like me & totally suck at Karaoke lol they make you feel amazing! 😃

I can't wait to go again!<//Review>

Saturday and Sunday brunch has the best breakfast in LA. Juicy thick bacon, thick sausage, fresh hashbrowns or potatos, pancakes and french toast, and the yummy belgium waffles! Only on the weekends and stops at 3pm! You wont be disapointed!< /review>

< Review>
I came to do two things...spend money on food and drink, and do some karaoke. The sleazeball DJ will skip you indefinitely if you dont give him cash (sorry, my card was at the bar). I caught him let the 50-something child predators skip to the front of the line for that sweet payola. F you, chump. You dont have a shred of decency. Bartenders all look like they want to kill themselves. I dont need even OK service...you could even spit in my face for all I care...all I want is the chance GIVE YOU MONEY in exchange for your goods. Its really not that hard and the place was empty. First and last visit to a depressing loserville. If you arent a local you are invisible. Free drinks being poured to buddies on the owners dime in exchange for a crisp 20. How do you leave a bar thirsty? This joint is pathetic and sad for all ages.<//Review>

Wow, unbelievable that this owner would rehire the same people that served spoiled food and couldn’t cook worth a penny. The owner should just sell the place. He didn’t seem to care at all. On top of that he demoted the head chef and the GM?< /text>

First of all, Eric, you are racist and your job is not to yell me what to sing. Your job is to write it down and play it. Do your job and stfu.< /text></record>

Boardwalk has a great atmosphere, music, the best drinks and the good food. I enjoy the mature audience which permits alot of fun without the youthful drama.</Text>

<Text>I don't normally write reviews on places I haven't been to but just saw them on 24 hours to Hell and Back and I'm disgusted by the sad excuse of an owner. Apparently he doesn't want a successful restaurant. The changes to staff make that apparent.</Text>< Pics>

The place should have continued to follow Ramsay's advice. Sad to see the owner wasn't strong enough to do that. A dirty place with ROACHES and terrible ROTTEN food is going to continue to be the theme. Shame that it is going to end up like the rest of the owners other failed restaurants.< /Text>

{'time': 1550321914922, 'text': 'I really don’t understand why people are giving us a one star rating and have never been in the restaurant. If you will look at the ratings before Ramsey came in and made us look so bad, you would see that we are getting mostly 5 star ratings. Have you ever thought that maybe the show was rigged to make us look bad? It’s only Hollywood, we really aren’t as bad as the tv show put us out to be. How can we look so bad overnight? It took us 17 years to build up a following and one day to tear it down. Please consider this before you rate us because of a reality tv show. Come in and see for yourself, we really aren’t that bad.\n\nP.S. The two Kat’s are still here. Keith is gone.'}</Resp>
