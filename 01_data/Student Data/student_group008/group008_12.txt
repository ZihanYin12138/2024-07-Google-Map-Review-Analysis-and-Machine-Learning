<text>The best service ever! Thank you Nouran.
I walked into the store to evaluate few items, the owner,Nouran, went above and beyond with his service. He is very friendly and knowledgeable about stones and jewelry. His honestly and knowledge gained my trust. I will go there anytime I need to sell my jewelry or buy a quality diamond. I highly recommend this store.</text></record>

< Review>
I came here to sell an engagement ring. I walked in and was greeted very kindly. Very professional men behind the counter. He explained to me the value of my item and told me I should save it rather than sell it. He explained the reasons why, and changed my mind. Very professional and kind people. These guys know their stuff and gave me great advice. Thank you guys. I'll see you soon for some new items ill be purchasing for myself. I plan on bringing all of my business here from now on.< /Review>

Found Gold Mine when I looked up silver sales near me and I read his reviews and they were all glowing so I decided to call. When Nuran answered the phone I could tell right away this was my guy. I told him what I had and he told me to come by and he just sounded so positive I couldn’t help but feel good when I got off the phone. Me and my brother headed straight there and Nuran greeted us warmly and was very honest about what we have. He offered us a fair price and the whole process was so easy and painless. I can’t count how many bad experiences I’ve had with pawn shops and gold/ silver sales places and their bad attitudes. This was a pleasant surprise and I highly recommend.</text>

<review>Do NOT GO HERE the other reviews have to be fake . But i went here believing they were true and got 60% of the fair market value of a gold ring. So i called the very next morning to ask if i can buy it back and not only did the guy refuse but he was extremely rude to my friend. Should i ever need to sell any of my things ever again, needless to say I will be taking my business elsewhere.

Update: i would like to know how you figure 80% . you cant just throw numbers out there and just say they are accurate. It was 60%</review><Rating>1< /Rating><GmapID>0x80c29b1e57523b43:0x7a35317b4fa7e868<//GmapID>< name>

This is by far the best place to sell your Gold.  Nuran is a true professional - knowledgeble, experienced and very honest.  I had a lot of gold jewelry I no longer wanted.  I tried several other places before I found Northridge Gold Mine.  Now I won’t do business with anyone but them.  They are the BEST you will find.</Review>

Very satisfied with this business.  My mom had some older 14k gold she no longer needed and wanted to sell. I went to three different places first including a pawn shop, but Northridge Gold gave me the best price by several hundred dollars.  They also took the time to explain how they determine the value based on the type of gold it is and current gold prices.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Ron is an expert jeweler with 35 years experience in the business. I went here to have him examine a diamond engagement ring I was looking to purchase. He was absolute class and extremely knowledgeable about diamonds. He had nothing to gain from the examination and even provided a steam cleaning and an ultra sonic cleaning of the ring free of charge. He verified the ring's authenticity and gave me some great pointers from his experience. He is an old school, European class act that I would trust wholeheartedly. He made the process informative and enjoyable, the whole time making me more comfortable in my purchase and knowledge. They don't make them like Ron anymore.

< Review>
Nuran was so informative on appraising our gold pieces. He tested the gold in front of us and weighed it. We checked the spot prices together and he was very clear on his percentage offer. We had done our homework before and weighed our gold ourselves. He gave us an offer over our expectation. Pointed out one of our errors that we had made on a gold chain. We thought our gold chain was 18k but his testing showed it was 21k. His honesty astounded us, we will highly recommend our friends to go to him to get the best deal on their gold.<//Review>

Nuran is personable, friendly, genuinely cares about people, and is high level fair in all of his buying/selling.   Could not have asked for a better experience, as I am one who has been interested in precious metals for years.  This is my new 'go to' location in the LA area!< /text>

Highly recommend. They beat all other offers for my gold. In addition, I needed my wedding ring fixed because it was missing a couple of diamonds and Nuran did an excellent job in no time at all. I’m very happy with my experience. Their service is impeccable.< /Text>

Went in for my first time yesterday and I can confidently say that this will be my first choice when selling my gold or diamonds. The two men that I had been greeted by are very professional and above all are honest businessmen who aren't looking to low-ball and rip-off their customers.
The owner had explained to me the process and broke down the numbers and rates according to gold's current worth.
I took in a bracelet that I had been offered $200.00 elsewhere and I was offered more than double that, and walked out with $531.00 cash.
This is the only business of this type that I feel confident to refer to my own family/friends.
Visit them today and you will not be disappointed. I would give them 10/10 stars if I could.
Thank you very much Northridge Gold Mine!!!</Text>

Since my savings wasn't enough, we decided to sell my wife's diamond ring that she inherited from her mother. We shopped at least six or seven places until we came across  Northridge Gold & Mine. They were professional at their best and provided us with the best offer we could get. Since we've recommended them to our friends and relatives.

I have been a customer of Northridge Gold Mine & Diamond buyers for a long time. I have bought a few pieces of jewelry from them. They gave me a good deal! I came today and sold some inherited jewelry, and he gave me a fair price. It was much more than I expected!
The owner Nuran is very knowledgeable and honest. I highly recommend him to anyone who is trying to sell or buy jewelry and diamond.< /text>

I have had several transactions with the Gold Mine ...and they were fantastic!  Sold some gold and various pieces of jewelry when my wife passed away and got a great price, each time...  Also had them make a couple of special pieces  for my daughter ...specifically two rings that were really magnificent!  Nuron, the owner (actually everyone in the store) is friendly, patient and knowledgeable ...It's always a pleasure to see them!< /Review>

Danger!! Danger!
Very shady and unprofessional! Possible swindle  and abuse.

I went to Northridge Gold with good will and intentions sell over 150 ounces of silver coins. As we were weighing my coins the owner grabs a hand full of my silver coins and walks over to the other side of the store with his hand and my coins under the counter!
When I politely said I would prefer that he not walk off with my uncounted coins out of sight, he went into a rage screaming that it was his store.
When I said it was unprofessional to take my coins out of sight he went into a full screaming fit with obscenities, name calling and repeatedly saying he has a great reputation. (If he really had one he wouldn't have to say it so much.)

I said I would leave. He screamed for me to get out without putting my coins in my briefcase. I said I would not leave without them then he charge me raising a fist to strike me. I said lay a hand on me and I'll sue you. (I'm much bigger than him but did not go there to dirty my hands on him.) All in all a total joke in security (they held the security door open the whole time I had my $3000 worth of coins on the counter!) Keep away. Danger.</Text>

<review>The Northridge Gold Mine came to my rescue today. I needed some cash for my gold today and called a few other stores in the area, they were all closed. Nuran, the store owner, was willing to go out of his way by opening his closed store in order to serve my needs. He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and honest. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to sell their gold on Sundays.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Two visits in two weeks to sell my old gold and silver. I'm a customer for life. The minute I walked in I was greeted with kindness and warmth that made me feel like I have known Nuran and his cousin all my life. Kind hearted, sincere, professional, and honest - who are these people? I had given up hope that people like this even existed anymore let alone a business. Well, if you are looking to get paid top dollar with lots of smiles and friendliness...look no further than Northridge Gold Mine.< /Text>< Date>

My experience has been great. I was referred by a friend of mine. I needed them to look at my watch because it didn't quite fit me. They were very friendly and professional and my impression to this store waa very great. I will definitely swing by again if I have another opportunity! The store is located inside a gas station, very easy to find! Thanks once again to this staffs that helped me relief my frustrations!<//text>

Nuran a great guy from the gate.  Very welcoming and gives you the top deal. If it's old or it's just holding dust in your home give him a try it's well worth it. I will be returning and telling all my friends< /Review>

Nuron (the owner of Goldmine) and Victor have been helping me with my gold and silver exchanges for around 3 years. I did my due diligence by comparing rates with no less than 8 various businesses. I concluded that Goldmine is the most fair and generous of all business with whom I met. To be clear, I brought a particular piece of jewelry to 8 businesses, and Goldmine offered me the most for the necklace. Not one of the other establishments matched the value Goldmine offered me. Since around 2013-14 I have strictly visited Nuron and Victor for my exchanges. Supreme gratitude to Goldmine for being honest and fair.< /review>

I inherited my  mother's  3ct . diamond ring I take it a couple of jewellers and couple of Diamond  Buyer's in the area I also went out of my way and went to downtown Los Angeles to the Jewelry district. After All the  disappointment that I had i found this place on Google and yelp he was highly recommended.  Nuran the owner educated me about my diamond he explained and showed me the  imperfections in the stone he even  graded  my  Diamond  on the spot. He gave me fully what I deserve for my stone.I highly recommend him to anyone is trying to sell a diamond ring.<//review>

The people who own this place are awesome. I went in to sell something. All calculations are done directly in front of you and not behind the counter. The owners are extremely nice, caring and honest. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

Nuran is a great guy! Whenever I have some jewelry to sell. He is the first person I got to. His prices are very reasonable. Maybe some of the best I've seen around. Whenever you have gold/silver to sell. Be sure to check out Nuran at Northridge gold mine!! You won't be disappointed.</text>

After being lowballed by multiple places I stubled upon this gem of a store. NURAN the owner is very friendly and tells you up front the truth. I would never sell gold, silver or coins to anyone else. So happy I found him. Highly cecommended!< /review>

I’ve never enjoyed the luxury of fluffNFold until now. Two cowboys working in the Santa Ynez mountains with a hundred pounds of laundry I’m sure tested their fortitude. However, rapid service and consistent smiles will keep us returning. We are more than happy to tip the hell outta these guys, as you should too!< /Review>

<Review>Clean, pleasant, and well lit with off street parking. Staff is very friendly. Machines are plentiful and well maintained. Change machines, snack vending and Wi-Fi.

If every business were run as pleasantly and efficiently as Launderland, this would be a wonderful world! Wash and fold service was perfect and delivered with a smile.<//text>

I started working with Launderland in July 2019 after we took over management of some vacation rentals in Carpinteria. Everything happened sort of last minute, but Sherri at Launderland was super helpful and responsive. The workers in the facility do a great job of sorting and folding our laundry. I'd highly recommend this facility for your commercial laundry needs.</Review>

<Time>1539210912381< /Time><Review>I've had mixed experiences here. One day all my laundry (multiple loads) ended up smelling like dog. One day there was a friendly man who helped me out when I looked lost. Normally, though, the ladies who work there don't acknowledge customers or try to help, but do talk among themselves loudly en español. There are lots of machines and the location is convenient. But there's another one down the road that's much more welcoming and seems better looked after.</Review>< rate>

<Text>The good....premiere gym/club in Chico. Family friendly and group friendly exercise.   The first picture is my service animal! No pets allowed. No matter you fitness level this is a great place.

The bad... they don’t have  paddle boards for the pool.<//Text>< Rating>

I have been a happy member for about 10 years. I love the filtered and chilled water dispensers. They could easily make a few bucks selling members water, but they make it free. Members win, and so does the environment.  A really nice touch!< /Text>

If you value beauty in life, then In Motion is worth every penny. I go for the cardio by the pool, the colorful lights in the gold room and the endless equipment available. Yoga program is great and the spin program is unbelievable!! Marie and Asher kick butt!! Love you In Mo</text>

Just renewed my membership after taking a small break due to COVID. Really enjoying being back, the staff is really doing their best to clean equipment and make people feel comfortable. They have plenty of machines and weights outside for people that prefer more distance. Overall I am pleased with my experience.</Review>

<resp>{'time': 1602007644298, 'text': 'Lisa,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Most exercise equipment has been placed to allow a safe social distance between members, allowing members the option to forgo a mask while at a workstation. If a safe social distance can not be maintained, members are asked to wear their masks. Members who do not follow these procedures are reminded of the procedures by the front desk. If that member is opposed to following our COVID procedures/protocols, they are talked to by our general managers. If issues continue to occur, they risk getting their membership revoked.\n\nExtra sanitation stations have been placed amidst the facility to encourage members to clean and sanitize. Members are strongly encourage to sanitize equipment before and after use. We have also increased staff on our facilities team to do extra sanitizing throughout the day.\n\nWe understand your concern and appreciate your feedback. If there is anything else we can do to make your experience at In Motion better, please let us know.'}< /resp><time>1622177922305<//time><user_id>105612401250527614051<//user_id>< pictures>

Throughout the pandemic in motion fitness has done a great job of remodeling and trying their best to stay open following CDC guidelines. However whenever I go there are always people in the areas where they’re supposed to be wearing masks and they are not. In addition although there are cleaning sanitizing stations many people using the weight machines or not spraying down or cleaning the machines after their use.It’s much better than it was mid pandemic that’s for sure. And I can’t wait to really be able to use all of the training equipment again. But not until they really start cracking down on all the young people who think and act like they are invincible.< /Text>

I like the different rooms to workout in. I have had a membership there for 3 years and it seems the bathrooms need maintenance everytime I go. This made it difficult to enjoy my experience.</Text>

Been a member here for over ten years. Great full service club. Lots of equipment so even at crowded times I'm still able to find areas to work out. Love the lap pool, as a triathlete it's always nice to know I'll be able to get a swim in when needed. Beautiful setting for a Health Club.</text>

<review>This place not only offers a great gym but excellent service by it's employees that keep this place serviced, super clean and professional.  While on the more expensive side, you get way more than what you pay for. From a track outside, circuits, excellent swimming pools and hot tubs, many many classes covering different types of things that people like to do to stay fit and of course great equipment. Oh! And did I mention a basketball court? You might be looking for a place that ticks all the boxes. This is it.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The ambiance with gorgeous plantings and the sound of running water is relaxing.  They have every type of equipment you can imagine.  FIVE pools, one with a waterfall and a par course.
Multiple workout spaces for more privacy.
I am so glad to be a member!< /text>

I’ve worked in gyms for the last decade and I’ve been impressed with INMo. The staff is generally very friendly and they continue to purchase new equipment and upgrade the older stuff. That’s not something every gym does and goes unnoticed by many. The gym is clean and with the newest improvements during COVID, the layout is much better. No gym can ever satisfy every member, but these guys try. My kids love the Kids area and we all love the large pool area and kids splash pad. Thanks INmo</text>

Amazing place to workout, swim, relax, and even take a group class! Inmotion is the closest thing to a resort and it has an amazing staff. The frontdesk workers are always a pleasure, they walk around and clean as well as talk and get to know the members! This is my favorite place, especially the Sauna (when its open).<//review>

< Review>
In -Motion is a great work our facility and environment, they have made huge changes due to Covid to allow guests to be able to work out in a safe environment. They offer so much equipment and space, different facilities like the pool, weights, a out door track, yoga rooms, and more. This gym has been so welcoming and I love my experience every time I go. I as a girl who often doesn’t like trying new workouts appointment around a lot of people, really appreciate having weights in the more private upstairs rooms or in the women’s bathroom to use and not feel over whelmed. I would reccomend this gym to anyone in the Chico area. 💪🏽🏃🏽‍♀️<//Review>

In motion has been my gym in Chico for the last two years. Their staff has always been friendly. Their facilities are always clean, and through covid they still strived to keep their doors open as long as possible. The outdoor gym was a great idea to keep the availability of the gym open and still be in compliance. Overall in motion has been a wonderful place to work out the last two years.< /Text>

They are not enforcing the use of masks or social distancing. The"outdoor"workout area is a joke. 5 times the amount of people that are allowed and there is NO WAY to even get 6 feet from the next person on the track area. The adults are allowing their children to use the komani course as a damn jungle gym!  Take your children into the play area or if you can't afford that..... leave them home.<//Text>

<resp>{'time': 1598551579681, 'text': "Aaron, Thanks for your feedback. In Motion's COVID-19 Safety Protocol states that max capacity during the pandemic is 300 people and we have yet to reach anything near that number. We have taken additional safety measures including increased signage which asks members to sanitize equipment before and after use, setting up many sanitation stations throughout the facility, increasing our facility staff, and placing equipment 6 or more feet apart. If two people are passing one another on the track, they have the option of running on the outer white lines which provides safe social distancing for members. Lastly, children who are YoFit certified are allowed to use gym equipment with parent supervision. We hope this helps ease your fears regarding the safety of our facility. If there is anything we can do to better your experience, please feel free to reach out."}</resp>< gmap_id>

In Motion is by far the best gym ever, they have an abundant amount of equipment to pick from. I’ve worked here for about 2 months and I’ve gotten to know the employees and they’re all so so awesome.

The pool seems the safest bet in CoV times. Many patrons inside choose to forgo masks. Thank goodness the pool is outside!</Text>

General management is very disrespectful and needs to change their attitudes, especially front desk employees. The general management is also not wearing masks, but Kids in Motion has been doing a great job wearing masks. They are the best run place in IMO.<//Text>

Such an awesome environment. Their equipment is great quality, and there are many different rooms throughout the gym so everyone can spread out and it not seem too crowded, regardless of how busy it may seem from the amount of cars in the parking lot! I’ve been going to the spin classes for the last few months, and each instructor I’ve had has been phenomenal!!!! Especially Ann W and LeAnn J. Their energy is exactly what I need to have a kick-a$$ workout.</text>

<text>Great place for a new Mom. I love the childcare and the fact that I can have some much needed "me time" while my toddler has a blast playing, he never want's to leave when I go to pick him up. It's nice to know that he is in good hands with a wonderful and caring staff. The girls know him by name when we come in. I was worried that the gym would be too crowded for my liking but I go at all different days and times and I never have an issue getting the equipment I want to use.</text>< Resp>

Buyer beware: if you sign up for a year long contract, your contract will end and they will continue to charge you until you physically show up and cancel your membership. No refunds, no negotiations. They'll tell you it's written in the several pages of contract that you signed, and while I suspect that's true, we all know that fewer than 10% of the population sits there and reads those things.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Membership was very friendly. Staff is great and welcoming every time at checkin, they always say enjoy your workout and say goodbye on the way out. Day care is top notch, those girls that watched my daughter in the infant room were always excited to see her. This is my first review I think I've ever left on any buisness and that is because I feel the need to let everyone know that IN MOTION is the place to be. Kaitlyn in membership if I spelled her name right? Is the best!!!< /text>

One main thing that stands out is that there seems to be low employee turn over, most of the faces are the same as when I started.  I did get a glimpse into one reason this may be, when one day I overheard, Marie, telling another employee that she does a great job and they are happy with her work.  Also, I never get bored as there's a wide variety of ways to work out.  The gym is clean and equipment seems to get fixed in a reasonable time frame.  Dues are a little on the high side, especially for new members, but the up side is that the money appears to be going back into the club in the way of maintenance and new equipment.  🏊‍♀️🏋️⛹️‍♀️< /Text>< pics>

<review>This gym may be one of the best gyms in all of Northern California, it has everything you need to have a great workout and then some! The staff is all very friendly and enthusiastic, the location is very central of Chico and that makes for a great gym location! The place is always clean and maintained! The CrossFit part of the gym has amazing trainers and speaking from experience, I went into it for 3 months and lost 30 pounds! If you want my honest opinion of whether you should chose this gym or not, I’d say do it!<//review>< Pictures>

Worst gym ever. They botched my sign up by "forgetting" to charge me the fees. Then I didn't find out until almost 3 months AFTER I joined and went to scan in. Front desk stopped me and said my account was over due. Then when I spoke with membership they said they would place my account on hold while we worked on this. Turns out that was messed up too because they charged me for two months of a membership I was told was on hold. Now they are trying to tell me that no one said my account would be on hold and that it was my responsibility to do it (when that's what I requested and was told would happen?). I was also told that this is "a known issue and it has been happening to others". I'm concerned about how they are handling people's money. Don't do it. Go to Chico Sports Club or wait a few more months for Planet Fitness.
Also people are rude and unwelcoming. Folks in the weight area slam their weights CONSTANTLY. It's always crowded and smells like dirty gym socks, no pun intended.<//review>

The aqua pool was very cold last week and on and off the week before. The pool's temperature is not monitored carefully to detect when the heater is beginning to malfunction. The pool is suppose to be at 86 degrees; this is important for people with arthritis and disabilities that can only get their exercise in this pool.

The manager told me there are "engineers" that are in some sort of charge of the pools during the day and it is assumed that the pool temperature is checked daily, but there is no record kept of it. They mainly depend on customers complaining that the pool is too cold. The pool is not monitored for temperature at night when the pool is closed. If the heater has broken down at night no one knows about it until a customer steps in it in the morning. The workers at the desk do not know the temp of the pool, they only know if customers complain. A few can still swim in it if it is a little cooler; it would be good if the temperature was known. Some proactive monitoring of the temperatures would detect when they begin to drop so a malfunction can be found immediately.

Do they need a fundraiser to help them get an iPhone App that monitors the temp in the pool? Because the 2 million dollar addition they are putting in perhaps has drained the budget?</text>

Horrible gym!!! I'm from out of town and I decided to work out there during my stay in Chico. First, it is expensive per day ($30), not even in the Bay Area is that expensive. Second, the machines seemed hand me downs, bought second handed. The equipment is old, rusty and stinky. Also, there is not enough space to work out, it is crammed! People in Chico are in need of a new and more upgrade gym and if they say it is a good gym, it's because they haven't seen better. Sad. Uff, hated there!... and to that reviewer that said: "Gym equipment is okay - poor layout.  Not bad for Chico I suppose..."   no bad for Chico? not nice. They also deserve better.

BTW, good luck parking.<//Review>

Wish there was a little more of a free weight type area. A bigger area for people to work on squats, deadlift, etc. All and all a very clean and friendly place.< /Review>

I have been a long time member,  and have seen the gym grow into the amazing facility that it is today. I would say hands down the best in town . The staff is helpful as well as the trainers  superb. However , the newest manager definitely needs better problem solving skills, as well as people skills. I have only spoke with him once and it wasn't a good experience. My advice is if there's an issue to be addressed Marie is your gal.</Text>

Most of the cable machines are old and not smooth. Seems like that’s what half of the members are there to do and less than 20 percent of the space in the gym is designated to weight lifting. Seriously crowded! If your looking to lift weights there are better gyms in Chico for a much cheaper price.<//text><userid>117817274306938699590</userid></record>

<date>1526514589044<//date><Rate>4</Rate><Review>The facility is great as a gym.
However, their childcare is not the best recently.
They cannot handle my baby more than 10 minutes.
They give me a call to pick up my baby as soon as I drop off and leave.
It has been like that almost for a whole year, and we are considering to change the gym because of it.
We have not been able to workout since they will not keep our baby and tell us to come pick up in 5 to 10 minutes everytime.
I also heard a young worker telling a fussy baby that no one likes a crying baby, so stop crying while I was dropping off my baby. They do not seem to hold babies but rather putting on swings or jumpers whenever possible. I know some workers there would wear babies or trying to cope with crying babies. Others just do not seem to try hard or care enough.
They also have only one bathroom in the daycare. That caused our another kid to have an accident waiting in the bathroom line.
It is a shame we cannot use the gym anymore unless the childcare (or workers) will be improved. We loved there a lot.

Updates...

We have been able to come back to the gym thanks to a few of hard working and caring workers at the child care. We especially appreciate the work of Maria who works at kids motion. She is genuinely nice and caring. I can see that she loves babies and kids. And our babies absolutely love her.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I have been a member for almost 20 years.  The lap pool is the best in town, and I have been very happy with my membership. That said, the women's showers could use some remodeling.  I also wish that people would not go into the women's sauna in street or workout clothes and with their electronic devices---very unsanitary, and not particularly relaxing watching someone texting on their phone---it's not how saunas are meant to be used.<//Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>My family and I have been members off and on for the past 7 years. The equipment is excellent, we love the childcare options and all the fun things they do and the pools are excellent.  This summer we wanted our boys to become better swimmers and the variety of pool sizes and temperatures has been perfect.
The only downside is cost. It's the most expensive gym weve ever attended and they dont have different packages for different needs. We were thinking of just getting a summer pool pass but that is not offered and if you dont sign up for at least a year it was going to be $600 for 2.5 mos. I do wish they had more options for prices and what services you do want to use. Honestly we dont really work out at gyms and choose to do walking outdoors so were paying for a bunch of things well never use.
That aside it is an excellent gym w a ton of classes and a little something for everyone. Were actually going swimming today!< /Text>< Pictures>

I have been a member at in motion fitness for two and a half years and will continue to be as long as I'm living in Chico. There are a lot of poor reviews here for the gym that I think are incorrect. In motion is the perfect mix for anyone looking to get in shape or anyone that is a serious bodybuilder the gym is constantly adding new classes and as of recently has been adding new equipment. There are times when the gym is insanely busy but there are also times when it is completely empty it is your job as a member to figure out those times do not complain about the business of a gym if you do not take the time to figure out when is the best for you to go. The staff has always been great and as a college student myself I am glad to walk in and see people of my same age behind the counter it makes for a very friendly atmosphere and it is great going to a gym where I can see handful of friends every day at any given time it is a great community and I consider it the best and only gym I will go to in Chico.</Text>

The facility is amazing that's why I gave it two stars. I came for a swim class and paid $15 (guest pass) on my first visit, came back today and it's $30. I hear are raising prices for memberships and the guest pass must have doubled...I left frustrated with my experience here.</Review>

<review>Nice gym. Great classes and accommodations. Only down side is there are too many people. I prefer less people. Somewhat of a meat-market feel but otherwise, it’s ok. Can’t beat prices of 24 hour fitness sorry. Paid $300 for a 2 yr membership at 24 hour fitness but its $570 for two people for 6 months at In Mo. meh...< /review>< Response>

Love everything about this place!  Service is great, the staff in the membership office is very helpful, and I always find the place clean and tidy!  Great place to get into shape!  The hours on here are off though, they are only open 24 hours Monday - Thursday.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they close at mid-night.</text>

<Review>I've been a member for 9 months. Great amenities BUT... not everyone wants to go out to the bars on Friday nights... Some people actually want the option to workout after Midnight. This is where I tend to want to stop driving out of my way and go to 24 Hour Fitness.. you get a key to the door there and can workout anytime you like... Some people don't have the luxury of making it to the gym normal hours or don't want to workout when the gym is over crowded at your busy times.<//Review><gmapID>0x808327ef064e824b:0x46dac9f677139fa4</gmapID>< Pictures>

Disgusting. I was in senior pool when woman got in with baby in diaper. I had to pay to cancel. If you have a baby you are home free. Otherwise Don't swim. Adults Don't generally have fecal matter on their legs, but if you are okay with it. jump in. Seniors should stay away. Staff makes it difficult to quit. You have to come in . Babies are allowed in all pools, by the way. Check online to see how dirty pools are with toddlers in them. Yikes!</Review>

My family comes 4-6 times a week to swim laps at night and for $100 a month for a family is a great price. The only part I wish they would change is if they let 18+ use the pools after 10pm. I would come swim laps at 2am when I cant sleep but other then that everything is beautiful. It is set up like a Mexican resort and has a villa feel to it. The staff has always been friendly and helpful to my family.</review>< GmapID>

<review>CONS...
Dry sauna was always broken, seemed to have issues, or never got hot enough. Very frustrating considering this lasted for years, and I always brought it up. Not sure if it's fixed now.

They used to limit you to just one measly towel. I assumed having a towel to sit on for the sauna and a towel to shower with wasn't too much to ask...

VERY CROWDED!!! This was probably one of the main issues. They seemed to spend a lot of money on advertising and getting people to sign up for the gym which was overcrowded instead of investing money to fixing the issues it had.

They would rent out the pool to aqua jets, swim club, etc.... which would limit the pool use.

After reaching my threshold, I took my Business to Chico Sports Club.

PROS
Very nice pool and outside area. Feels like a resort.

Always seem to offer free classes for members IE: Yoga, spinning classes, etc.

Great hours! They were always open most hours of the day, which smokes out Chico Sports Club who had limited hours

A nice atmosphere and nice gym to say the least. Just way too crowded.

If you're a pool person, this might be the gym for you. (You just have to coordinate around the hours the pool always seems to be in use with).

Good if you plan on taking advantages of the classes they offer.<//review>< Rating>

I love In Mo. That said, many people like me can only work out in the Aqua Pool because of injuries. While In Motion has invested heavily in other areas, the water fitness Aqua Aerobics pool does not appear to be a priority. The pool has been closed for at least two weeks because it has been too cold and a part had to be replaced, a part that should probably be on hand no matter what the expense. It seems that folks over 60 are not a priority for the owner or management team. There is a shower in the women's locker room that needs to be fixed and has a "to be determined" date on it--and has for over a year. Really?  In Mo is expensive and patrons of all ages deserve what they pay for.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I was a member for a total of 5 years. It's a nice gym. But the staff is terrible. Most of them just don't seems to care. The worst is the manager Chris. Just no personal touch. I went in to cancel my membership on a Saturday. The person in memberships was very busy and asked to sign a cancellation form. I was not give a copy of the form. I surrender my cards and cleaned out my paid locker. I was told I would not be charged anymore dues. Then 11 days later my bank account was charged 83.00 more dollars. When I called I just got transferred from front desk to accounts to memberships to Chris the manager. He stated normal company policy was to require a 30 day cancellation. I asked then why did I turn in my cards empty my lockers. If I had another 35 days to use the gym. I understand now why I did not get a copy of my final payment.

I have been a member at various gyms outside of Chico including Sacramento and Bay Area and this is the first with practically everything (including day care!).  Some reviews on here seem to forget how fortunate we are to have a facility like this in this area... Yes, I have come to the gym when the lap pool was closed or the sauna (hot room) wasn't working or some of the equipment was in repair, but come one, these guys operate almost 24/7 with constant use, I don't think its a huge inconvenience when some of these areas need to be repaired once in awhile - in those cases I just adjust my workout and move on. I come to the gym 2 - 4 times a week during the "off hours" like 7 pm -8 pm or 12 noon so I never battle crowds but understand it can get very busy; as someone mentioned before, you might just have to adjust your workout plan or times but this is the same issue at most gyms. If in motion capped their membership I think there would be many more upset customers than happy ones at this point especially because In Motion still has plenty of workout space. If you're a parent, the day care is a life saver...it does get busy sometimes but I have never had an issue with my kids going there. I wish the hours were a bit longer on the weekdays and earlier on the weekends but by no means a deal breaker. Some equipment could use a facelift as some weight plates stick sometimes or equipment is a little outdated but you can almost always find what you need for what it is you're working out. The classes are also a great feature (my wife goes to a few). Btw.. the rates are pretty fair considering all of these amenities.. On the conservative side its about $100 per month for family which is $25 per person per month..this includes day care, classes and a full locker room with steam room and sauna as well as all of the pools. I used to pay $30 per month just for my self at a local gym with small space and only weight machines. All in all it has been great! I haven't had to complain yet and my interaction with management has been minimal  but staff seem happy and are always nice.</Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Gmap_id>

The staff is friendly, the pools are great, the locker rooms and steam room is excellent.  My only complaint about the lockers is that there is no phone to call the front desk if you accidentally lock yourself out after a shower.  Almost all of the headphone jacks to the TV's do not work and need to be replaced.  It is annoying when trying to watch TV when only a few of the headphone jacks work properly.  Hopefully they can fix these issues.</Review><rate>4< /rate><name>Andy Vaughan< /name><pics>None</pics></record>

Overall, the gym is pretty nice.
The precor machines out in the general aerobics room seem to break down a lot & probably need to be replaced along with more added.

The women's locker room has issues. It seems the maintenance of the locker room is taking a back burner to the addition of new equipment, etc.
Today, 2/28, there was no soap in all five of the sinks.  A lady was at the gym Friday evening at 6 pm and there was no soap.  (Soap in bathrooms?? Pretty basic health issue)
The receptionist said she didn't have a key to the supplies; that her supervisor, who came in at 9 would have access to the supplies.
I talked with him also. He said a cleaning service is used, but the key is not available to the front desk staff.  I suggested that IMF could buy some pump soap and make that available if the regular dispensers run out.
Additionally, a lock on the 4th restroom has been broken for over 3 weeks.  I've notified a number of IMF staff over this time period, but it hasn't been fixed.
A plug by the back sinks has also been out of commission for about 4 weeks.</review>

Just stared going to this gym. Clean and well taken care of from what I have noticed. Parking is always tough. Some machines have wear on cushions. Should be addressed before injury or infection happens.<//text>

I find smaller facilities are more personable.  It's not that the staff are unpleasant, but sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing--i.e.15 minute wait for towels to get out of the dryer.  I was disappointed in lap pool access--led to believe that most lanes are available for lap swim, but, in reality, the majority of the lanes are in use by swim groups and swim clubs during the prime swimming periods--i.e. when the sun is not full bore.  There are supposed to be three lanes open at all times for members, and members are good about sharing these lanes. But,with such a large membership(and with provisional reservation of 1/2 of the last lane for lessons), the lanes become overcrowded and problematic.  The club will say that 79% of the swimming hours are open to members, but I would contend that those hours are during high sun and on weekends.  Still, I give it a four star overall.</review>

<Review>I pay a premium so that my family can have a membership here. The gym itself is fine (nothing amazing) but the service and the way they treat members is appalling. You want to swim in the lap pool? You'd better be at least 14 years old -- and KEEP MOVING AT ALL TIMES!!! (Apparently, sometime in the distant past, a group of 13 year olds caused problems in the lap pool; so, obviously the only solution is to punish ALL under-14-year-olds and their families, even though you pay the same price no matter the age.) They do have a "resort pool" (shaped like a kidney bean and about the same size), but you have to be willing to put up with kids bouncing off of you. (You do get the added bonus of the special additive they put in the water, which comes out of the bladders of all the kids who splash around there... I wonder if they charge extra for that?) They also have another pool, perfect for families; oh, that one is reserved for swimming lessons, even in the off-season when there aren't any lessons given, so tough luck. Did you forget your card to check in? Well, that's too bad; no matter the fact you PAY OUT THE NOSE to have the honor of using the gym AND THEY HAVE YOUR PICTURE ON FILE, they will no longer let you in. That's right, their valued customers will get turned away at the door. (Again, in the recent past they used to let you just sign in, but again apparently some people abused this courtesy; so, of course the solution is to treat all of their paying customers who forget their cards like dirt.) And the counter people look at you when you walk in like they're doing you a favor, and you're inconveniencing them by making them pause in the middle of their personal conversations. It is amazing the way they treat families here (and most certainly not in a good way.) I don't know if their staff just isn't trained to give good customer service, or if they ARE actually trained to look at their gym members like they're lesser people (although the fact that their policies are very anti-member makes me suspect the latter). I know the solution would be to change gyms, but this gym is right down the street, and that convenience is the only thing that actually gets my lazy butt to the gym. So, I just take it with a smile, and complain about it later.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Rating>1<//Rating><GmapID>0x808327ef064e824b:0x46dac9f677139fa4< /GmapID><Time>1404674434630</Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have been a member for about two years. Great gym, classes are fine staff are good but i find it difficult to actualy go and do what i want, lift free weights, unless i want to go at 4 am or 9 pm. Being a dad and working full time makes this nearly impossible. One other suggestion, provide a better discount for payed classes to the members, it really doesnt cost that much money to do so, cross fit im looking at you.< /text>< pictures>

I had a year membership that I just let expire in November.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews that said the staff is very unfriendly.  Never a greeting or even look me in the eye.  I never felt welcomed and never saw a trainer available to ask a question or show how to use a machine or tell me if I was doing something right or not.  The trainer I did have was more afraid of her (the club?) being responsible if I got hurt so I learned nothing from her.  The afternoon aquatics teacher is sooo boring but the early instructor was great! the hour just flew by.  Wish I could be available for the morning classes.  The yoga classes and studio are wonderful.  Better than wonderful.  Wish the Zumba wasnt so "hip-hop".  Bad for my knees, but tremendous fun and energitic and student focused instructors.  I called to get another private trainer and was told I had to call the head trainer, but he never got back to me.  Found the club to be very clean.  Do wish there werent so many costs for extra classes.   Maybe I'll cross my fingers and give it another try as my aging body really needs professional attention and guidance.</Text>

Pretty good buffet! Only $10.50. Fresh. Simple array of Vietnamese flavors. Waitress kinda had an attitude. Otherwise pretty good! It's next to Momo's in the Airport Cinemas complex of Airport Blvd. Nice option if you work in the area for lunch.</review>

<text>This is a charming little restaurant with a very friendly staff and good food. I've only been here during Covid, but the food is a good and consistent quality. It's a great lunch spot with a large variety of noodle, rice, and soup dishes. The wait for pick-up isn't long, but still 10-15 minutes, so call ahead.</text><Name>Devin Vega<//Name>< user>

Delicious food. The lunch Buffet is worth each penny. Too many delicious foods for the buffet. Nice place. 4/5 for ambiance, 4.5/5 for food and 5/5 for cleanliness.<//text>

One of my preferred spots for Vietnamese food. It's so savory. The service here is great. The place has a cool atmosphere. Food and atmosphere reminds me of Kansas City.< /Text>

Went in for the buffet and boy was it unimpressive. Chow mein was hard and bland. Spicy shrimp stuff was over cooked like a piece of gum in juice. Wanted to try as buffets are hard to come by in our area.  And very few selections. 8 -10 stations with 2 bring rice and said Chow mein.  Will not be back. Went at 12:30 and was dead inside, food had not been restocked in a while  More people ordering off the menu to go than sitting in store. Maybe menu is better but at a more expensive price. Try at your own risk.<//text>

Ive been going here for years and LOVE the food. although, when I went here on 11/11/16 my fiance and I ended up walking out because of the service. We sat there for 10 minutes without being asked what we wanted to eat or if we wanted something to drink. Furthermore, their buffet was empty and unwilling to fill it.< /review>< response>

<Text>I try really hard to like this place, and I’ve been at least 15 times. There’s not enough consistency with the service (there’s a gal who has amazing customer service and another who seems annoyed to have customers),  the food is inconsistent too (I’ve had the salt and pepper shrimp so overcooked and rubbery I didn’t eat half of it, and the eggplant so undercooked it was raw sponge in the middle).  The spring rolls are always good, and the salads have been fresh and crisp. It’s a good place to go if you are hungry and on the move, but this isn’t a place for a date or a place to impress your supervisor (tried that).<//Text><UserId.>103155141679789865070</UserId.></record>

I usually get the bun dishes always good.  Today I decided to try the buffet . Spicy shrimp, excellent . Spicy beef also good.  Chicken wings delicious  but had been in the table a bit long so slightly dry.  There was a variety  of other dishes -good but didn't stand out next to the spicy dishes.  My wife cannot skip the pho. This is our favorite Vietnamese place in Sonoma county !
We dropped by here for soup. My wife had Pho #10, I had the spicy beef noodle soup# 17. Fabulous! Interesting flavor good level of spice. Great hoisin sauce! Service was good and accommodating. Another good experience!</text>

The service wasn't worth that.< /text>

The staff is so friendly and trying their absolute hardest but they’re very busy. They remained kind through numerous people without appointments being super rude to them. The girl only had to poke me once which is rare with small veins and was so nice! Loved her! I can’t remember her name but wow! Great staff!!</review>< pictures>

<review>My two year old had to go to the bathroom as we were waiting for our appointment. They said they couldnt find his lab orders (even though i had it with me from his doctor just in case) and therefore wouldnt let him use the restroom. He had to pee in some bushes outside. Very cruel to do to a child.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Signed in, asked if they could please confirm lab order was received so that I didn't wait and not be seen (happened before). Was told they had 6 patients ahead and had to wait after them to be helped. Horrible people skills, 0% customer service skills. They weren't even busy. Everyone was sitting down. It looked pretty stable as far as patient processing. Maybe they need a raise or better management so that they can help patients better.< /review>

Horrible place, it took forever to be seen, employees are talking about their private life with other employees and everyone in the waiting room can what every word they say. There's empty boxes everywhere, good luck making it I to the room if you need a walker or have a stroller. It's like a messy storage unit, I can't believe this is even allowed. Also the results take forever, at least 2 weeks, absolutely ridiculous.< /Review>

<Review>This establishment is very slow. They do not value their patients time. Most people visiting this lab are fasting and the staff shows no sense of urgency. I took my 1 year old and my School age child here. After waiting for over an hour- I addressed the employee behind the desk to see how much longer the wait would be because my children were starting to grow antsy due to fasting. The employee then told me that everyone here in the lobby was fasting comparing adults to a toddler and child. What a clueless and thoughtless comment to make.<//Review>< rate>

< review>
One of the worst experiences I’ve had in awhile. 1-1/2 hr waiting listening  to an unruly kid. I told Heather at the front desk I couldn’t stand it and I would be outside the door. (40 degrees). While I was standing there they called my name. Since I was not in the waiting room I got pushed to the back and they would not take me next. I finally lost it and asked why Heather didn’t warn me I could lose my place in line and she had nothing to say. Rude, especially Heather and very unprofessional. I heard
Heather tell people dropping off samples to sign in and it would be 30-45 minutes. Wow!  The “Razzie Award” goes to Heather for being untrained in customer service and just plain rude< /review>

<Review>I had a awful experience in Quest. I arrived at 6:10am on Aug 7, 2017 and there were two lab techs Dawn and Wendy the day.
I've had my blood drawn a lot in life and five fertility  treatments and it's never been bruised or hurt for longer than a couple days. It's not even at the needle entry, it's off to the right and still hurts. Arm pain from a simple blood draw is definitely an area of concern.
I informed quest customer service line about my experiences and got a call from a lady who informed that supervisor is on vacation and she will be back in 3 days. I haven't received any call from the supervisor yet and I'm still waiting ( more than week)
Lab tech Wendy supposed to drawn my blood, but she STOP and walk away. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and RUDE!!!
Finally the other lab tech "Dawn" came and drawn my blood. She has a LACK of EXPERIENCE. Stay away from her. She may hit deep my nerve. It's never been brushed or hurt for longer than a couple days. BE AWARE of THIS PLACE. UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE and LACK of EXPERIENCE!!! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!< /Review>< userid>

The Phlebotomists were all friendly and attentive. Check-in was done via an iPad app which puts you in line with an approximate wait time (if you don't have an appointment). Dawn drew the blood from me. She did an excellent job; no extra pain, held the vials still between changes. The facility was clean. I recommend this location.< /Text>

This place is horrible. I don't know why its always just women that work here. They must all be on their monthly because they are always rude as hell and make you feel very uncomfortable. Far from friendly, this place sucks.<//Review>

Chech in and had a 87 plus minute wait.  Went out and ran an errand, 40 minutes and came back to find my name erased from the board.  Why have a sign in and wait board?< /Text>

Front desk lady is terrible. Me and husband came for blood test and even she didn't see the paperwork and ask us to sit down until she call. Guess what, she handed us the glucose liquid an hour after that and needs to wait extra an hour meanwhile there is a lady just came and she handed her over her glucose liquid. Call me 5 minutes after and sure I can't do it since I still have 55min waiting time for the glucose liquid. Why don't just see the paperwork first? Who cares only two of you who are working at the day. First of all, see paperwork. Terrible ... Next time I will ask my OBGYN to send me to other laboratory.< /Text>

< Review>
This company uses illegal tactics and is unreasonable. Their process with how funds are withdrawn and paid back are extremely unethical. I spoke with one of their reps today and asked about a settlement since times have gotten harder to payback the balance since COVID and my industry was hit hard with shutdowns.

The representative told me she wanted to be honest and that I didn't want to request a settlement because they would offer a settled amount of only 80% and then charge off the remaining 20% which is highly unusual and illegal. The whole point of a settlement is to agree on a reduced amount in one lump sum, not to then send the remaining amount to collections. I will be filling as many complaints, etc to fight this.

Proceed with caution, this company is the worst and I hope they don't survive this pandemic like many other companies with shady practices.<//Review>

Nelson Long was my consultant and he was very pleasant to work with.  Although the terms and website are very straight forward and easy to understand and navigate, he took the time to still explain everything to make sure I did in fact understand all my options, as well as how to access all the information on the website.  I appreciate the fact that he presented my options in a calm and non-aggressive manor.  This line of credit was an option for me at this point and not a necessity.

Kabbage was fast and easy.  I was about to give up on getting a loan but with very little effort was able to get cash within 2 days.  John Harrison and his team are upbeat and made the process easy to understand.  Rates are comparable to a credit card so this kind of loan is best if you can pay it back quickly.  No prepayment penalties.  Structure is unconventional but fit our needs.< /review>

Very helpful until the shutdown.  2008 all over.  This institution should NOT be supported.  They are not inexpensive or reliable.  I would never have started with them if I knew what un American parasites they are.    When you need them don't waste your time.   They will gladly become the wound that won't heal.  Very sad for their decent employees.< /review>

<Review>Kabbage made a wrong calculation on my PPP loan. I returned the loan on June 4 so that they could update my loan amount.  Finally reached Kabbage customer service on June 16 and found Kabbage did nothing after receiving the returned money on June 4.  Kabbage rep told me that they would investigate and email me the same day. Now it is the June 17, no email and no response.

It is very difficult to reach Kabbage by phone. I've called more than ten times, and almost every time, the line goes dead and I cannot reach customer service. Same as its email: no response</Review>< Pictures>

I started contact with Kabbage a couple of weeks ago, Nelson contacted me and at first the amount was too low for my business need. I almost gave up but Nelson called m as I was thinking of going elsewhere and he was able to increase the offer beyond my expectations. Then the entire process was very smooth and Nelson was the ultimate guide through this. Thank you Kabbage and Nelson for a very easy process and I know you will be my partner in future needs for cash flow funds.</Review>

<review>I had a wonderful experience working with the Kabbage team. They were always ready to listen and work with me. Tobias McCluie helped with some issues with my account. He demonstrated listening skills, patience and the ability to resolve the problem.  I'm very grateful for his support and assistance .I would also like to mention Kelly and Michael who helped with some technical issues. Thank you.

<Text>I looked into Kabbage when we were trying to shift the credit for our company off our personal credit to a business card. At first I thought it was another one of those loans where they take the money out weekly which isn't practical for us  as we don't get paid weekly. I was going to look elsewhere when John Harrison contacted me and explained everything. I gave this 4 stars because I have just taken my first loan out with them and haven't started the repayment process, but if everything goes as explained, we should be able to shift a lot of our credit needs to this card, which is a lower interest than you can get with most any other loan or credit card and it won't keep hurting our credit! I'm excited to see  how this works! John has been great about making sure I know exactly how things are going to work and what to expect.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>We used Kabbage to help with our PPP loan application process as we were having trouble getting through to our bank.  The Kabbage team, especially Nelson L, was incredibly helpful and quick to reply with information.  They made the process easy and their quick responses helped calmed our nerves during a very stressful time.   I'm positive they are the reason we got funding before the money ran out.<//Text><Time>1588880142227</Time>< rating>

Our representative, Nelson Long is so informative and knowledgeable about the business. He helped us understand the process of how Kabbage works. Now with the knowledge we received from Nelson, we can move on and build a good relationship with Kabbage.

<Text>I completed my application today after I was contacted by Nelson Long who was able to substantially improve the offer they first made.  I must say the initial process was not great, completed the application and did not find out the loan amount until after the application was complete including Kabbage doing a hard pull on my personal credit report and came back with a very low loan amount.  However, once Nelson Long got involved, the process was substantially better and the loan product is very competitive compared to other business loan lenders I looked at. Would highly recommend but be aware upfront that the application process will do a hard pull on your credit.< /Text></record>

We really needed some assistance in covering a very last minute expense. From noon yesterday I was able to get approved instantly and get the funds wired this morning with the incredibly helpful assistance from John Harrison. He returned every phone call and replied to every email with professionalism and patience. He helped expedite the transactions and calmed my fears of losing the opportunity to expand my business. Thank you so much.< /Review>

Our small business was helped by Kabbage.  Kabbage's approach is to automate to the extent possible the details of the customer experience, but provides customer service when needed.  In my case, a particular shout-out to Nelson Long for his dedicated customer service getting our issues addressed.  Thanks!</text>

The Kabbage process can be quickly completed and is very easy to work with. Nelson Long provided great customer service answering all of our questions with patience, and without pressure. It took us some time to make the decision to move forward, but once we did Nelson was again very supportive with finalizing and completing the process very quickly. Great work!!< /Review>

Kabbage is awesome! The process is simple. The terms are clear, and unlike traditional lending institutions, the process is quick and doesn't take weeks to fund. Plus my Account Manager John Harrison was very responsive and knowledgeable. Just terrific!< /Review>

Kabbage is great! It's so easy to use and my investment consultant, Nelson Long , is just spectacular - so helpful, no pressure, and a genuinely nice person to deal with. The whole process of signing up, withdrawing, and making payments (with NO prepayment penalty!!!) is ridiculously easy. It really helps with cash flow when we have a lot of expenses for a big funeral and have to wait to get paid on an insurance claim. I'm looking forward to a long and happy relationship with Kabbage!<//Review>

Thank you everyone and hopefully this is the start of a long relationship. I would 100% recommend them to anyone small or big looking for ease of their platform.  Thank you again.< /Text>< time>

<Review>I own a preschool facility for the past 24 years. This is the first time in need of a cash flow. Kabbage has made it easy and fast. The application was painless, and I was connected to an agent immediately. I always got a call back and he was more than able to answer all of my questions. I did my research on Kabbage, and can honestly say that my experience was very satisfying. BIG thanks to Nelson Long. Thank you for walking me through this very big professional milestone</Review>< pics>

I need to talk to some one to solve continuous problem in singing in process for approved PPP loan.
no phone call or emails was answered for more than 20 times for over the last 10 days .  I can not apply PPP in other institutions since this is already approved with Kabbage.
Email answer was simply genetic notice without even reading it.
i need to know how to approach it now.
this is the last resort I am attempting .</review>

I got mail from Kabbage advertising small business loans. I decided to give them a try. Within seconds of applying I was approved and received a call from Danny Beebe. He was very professional and had great customer service skills. There was an issue with linking one of the services through Kabbage's website, and Danny put in a work order ticket right away.< /review>

<Review>John Harrison helped merged my two businesses under my Kabbage Account. I didn't understand the situation and was having trouble but John Harrison made the process seamless. He was very accommodating answering any questions and telling me upfront all the implications of the loans were.

We were faced with a situation in which our normal process was disrupted due to new Government initiative, all account receivable were delayed by at least 6 weeks,  but we have financial obligations to meet in less than 2 weeks, 'facing the barrel of a gun'  Banks were looking for years of tax returns prior to help, no where else turn, . I remembered seeing Kabbage on shank tank , so I went to google and found them, I called and was walked through the application steps, in less than 20 minutes we were given more than we needed as line of credit, I though I was dreaming, when the fund got our account I  knew then it was not a dream but reality, the relief of pressure is indescribable. Cash flow issue is a small business biggest nightmare- Kabbage made it look easy. Thanks John Harrison you guys have saved us. Traditional Banks are not for the upcoming business. Without Kabbage not sure what would have happened.
Thank you again Mr John Harrison will forever be grateful.<//Text>

<Review>Had a great experience with Kabbage. My Consultant, Nelson Long, took the time to explain in great detail how it all works, fee structure, withdraws, and repayments.  I took a draw and told him that after I had paid it back, I was pleasantly surprised that the entire thing went exactly as he said it would.  No hidden fees or complications.  Just super straightforward, easy, and FAST to access the capital I needed, and get it paid back. Thanks a lot!<//Review><date>1530125353908< /date><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

Danny Beebe did an awesome job from start to finish.  He stayed in-touch just enough.  When I told him that I didn't need anything at the beginning, he gave me space, and then when I finally needed to use my line, he was there to guide me through the process.<//Review>

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire loan process - how easy it is. In short time span of less than two hours, my business loan was approved. To make matters very much comfortable, my account manager Nelson Long stayed on the line with me for about 26 minutes and walked me through entire process. I sincerely appreciated. I wish, I would have started working with KABBAGE long time back and Nelson, Thank you very much.<//Review>

<Date>1546634713965< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I have been shuffling funds around for cash flow purposes and Kabbage had sent me an offer letter.  I applied online to just check out the service and Nelson Long called me from Kabbage to follow up.  After talking with Nelson and going through the services, my line increased 5X the original offer amount and the rate stayed the same.  Nelson Long followed up with me 2 days later and I executed the line since it saved me 5% over what I was paying for other money with an immediate cash savings.  I'm very pleased with my Kabbage experience.</Review>< pics>

Received a Letter from Kabbage Inc  about loans available ,  I decided to give it a try . Was impressed at how easily it was to apply for funds from Kabbage . Was approved within the hour , Kabbage Representative Nelson Long gave me some helpful tips on what to do with the loan and called me within minutes with some helpful advice and also told me to feel free to call anytime if need be.  For a person like me with Average credit this was a no hassle quick way to get funds , I will be using this service for a long time ..   Thanks again Much Appreciated Patrick</Text>

I paid the Kabbage loan this morning. I very much appreciate the rapid application process and your helpful personal assistance. I'll be using your service again to maintain a healthy balance during periods of sluggish payments by some of our accounts and also to purchase new equipment.

Working with Kabbage, Inc has been such a great experience. They came through with perfect timing as my company is going through an expansion period, and my Investment Consultant, Nelson Long, made the process very simple and enjoyable along the way. Instant trust was made upon our first encounter. I look forward to a continued partnership with Kabbage.</review>

<Text>More and more our world is controlled by computers, algorithms and AI. So, I was pleasantly surprised when after being approved for a line of credit, I received a call from Nelson Long at Kabbage. He was warm and cordial, and his call made me feel welcomed and appreciated. Additionally, he explained some of the finer points of working with Kabbage that I would not have learned from the website. Thank you again Nelson and I look forward to working with you!< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Kabbage was quick to respond to Clarity Pools needs. Working with our Investment Consultant Nelson Long, Nelson was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions as needed, Nelsons follow up was spot on helping us from the beginning process to guiding us withdrawing the Funds we needed. Clarity Pools appreciates all that Nelson has done for us.
Thank you,
Jonathan< /Review>< Pictures>

Although I was not initially approved for funding with Kabbage, they were easy to work with.  Unlike most funding companies it was not a hard denial.  There were measures in place for me to improve my chance of approval and I received notification shortly after that I had been approved. The process was explained and the representative, Nelson Long, made the process seamless and answered any questions or concerns I had.  I look forward to continuing my relationship with them.< /Text>

Tobias McClure, thank you for bringing the Christmas Miracle to my house.  How the Grinch stole Christmas was only a story in my daughters' book shelf until the Grinch came into our life. And you sir, brought hope and are the true sign that miracles do happen. Thank you for helping me understand and clearing up my doubts. And thank you for the extra help you offered.

I have to say this was the easiest loan I have taken.  Nelson Long was extremely professional and easy to speak to.  Kabbage has given me the growth opportunity i have been waiting for.  I have been building my pest control business for over 20 years and it was time to expand and thanks to Kabbage it is now possible!</Review>

<Review>Kabbage has worked great for short term financing for our General Contracting company.  The process was simple and easy to understand.  Fees are clearly stated as well as important dates as they relate to fees.  Our representative, Nelson Long was extremely helpful and patient with us.  I can see this being a long term relationship for our short term needs.<//Review>< Pictures>

Kabbage is very easy to apply for, easy to use, and the customer service is outstanding. Nelson Long is our account Rep and he's been extremely helpful in getting us the finds we need to grow our business.  The fees are a bit high, but competitive given the flexibility and ease of obtaining and using funds.</Review>

<text>Nelson Long at Kabbage was personable and helpful and I enjoyed working with him. He is knowledgeable and explained the details of the program to me. Kabbage is a helpful tool for small businesses like ours to help with cash flow for payroll while we wait on our 30 day receivables with our vendors.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Kabbage is really a seamless and quick option for getting working capital. Their staff Danny and Nelson Long were knowledgeable and helpful. They treated me like a person not a number. Both were patient with me on the phone while I was trying to navigate the web site.</Review>

<Text>My 'local' bank didn't want to work with us after being with them since 2005 with a spotless financial record.  Kabbage, and our Investment Consultant, Nelson Long, made the loan process simple and expeditious.
The capital allowed us to purchase additional fermentors at a reasonable rate, allowing further growth of Mother Road Brewing Company.< /Text>< rating>

I have been a small business owner for almost 5 years, and Kabbage has proven to be the most cost-effective no hassle solution to my funding needs. Nelson Long, my account representative, sought to make sure I  picked the best possible combination of amount to withdraw and length  of repayment to fit my cash flow.<//Review>

Worked with my Account Consultant Danny Beebe on Oct. 1st for my first business funding.  He was very helpful and informative while assisting me with my transaction and making the process seamless & easy to say the least.  Looking forward to working with Danny again when I need to use my additional funds for my business.  (TFEG, LLC)<//Review>

Gotta tell you, going to bank is excruciating and painful. Starting my first Kabbage account this week. When I’m done with this term, I’m looking forward to doing more business with them.<//text><Time>1547658085139</Time>< name>

< Review>
I have to admit when it comes to loans and lines of credit. The sales perso. Or account manager is always so money hungry. I did not find this to be the case with Kabbage account manager John Harrison. He was patient, just the statement alinr " dont borrow more than you need " made me feel comfortable and i wouldnt be bullied into taking out more than I need. Thanks< /Review>

<text>We at Accel want to tell Kabbage what an excellent experience we had today working with loan specialist Nelson Long to find the right loan package for our Corporation. Not only was Nelson easy to talk with, he also asked key questions that got us to a solution for our company's needs quickly, and was able to set up the availability of funds to take place tomorrow. Nelson suggested a plan that matches our debt repayment with our history of cash flow.

This man is definitely a valuable asset to Kabbage. He probably should earn more than he is at present...and just so you know we say all this without any coaching from him.

Our Best,
Wayne Moore Ph.D

I wasn't sure if this would work for me, after giving Johnathan Harrison the third degree and making him wait a few months  till I made up my mind I decided this is was a loan I could deal with. There was no pressure and the process was easy.</text>

Stupid automated system they utilize...you can make 15K one month, $4,100 next 2 months and be disqualified...their criteria is monitored by an automated system. I made $$7,501.97 in May, $3,310.29 in April, $5,281.43 in March and their dumb automated system can't figure out I did more than their minimum requirement of $4,200 a month...I did @ 16K! Still disapproved!!!< /text>

Overall decent venue. Good size for anything sports related. Stage is small and without wings. Sound system works however recommend bring your own. Perfermed here multiple times growing up. Most seating is folded metal chairs.< /review>

<text>I have been to many functions at the Oroville Municipal Auditorium including a cat show, many different classes and a memorial service.
The auditorium was built in 1912 and been used for many events including an evacuation Center, the annual community Christmas dinner and the Old Time Fiddlers' yearly championship event.</text><rating>4</rating><Response>None<//Response><Date>1502274600298<//Date>< Gmap_id>

They're reasonably priced, and not only were they able to accommodate both of my Huskies on short notice, but they got them done in just a few hours. My boys have never been so clean and well groomed before. I'm extremely happy with the service.</text>< pictures>

Extremely rude service. Walked in and received 0 greetings and a bunch of dirty looks from the women working here. They did a good job on my dog, but terribly failed at providing friendly customer service. The women in the back had especially bad attitudes, why would you ever think it’s ok to stare down a customer amidst a transaction? No exchange of words whatsoever, just a disgusting glare. Apparently that’s how this business operates- the environment was uncomfortable to be around. None of them were wearing masks why working on the dogs. I’ve visited a lot of the dog shops in hemet/San Jacinto and would highly recommend any other service EXCEPT here. You don’t get to treat customers poorly and still expect a growing clientele.< /Text>

<text>Friendly, capable staff.  My dog nipped at the owner, so she charged me a little extra to trim my dogs nails. Dont blame her a bit!  They did a great job, very attentive to walk-in customers, & the place smelled good!

My Schnauzer looks great everytime. And dosnt come home upset, like he has in the past from other groomers. There are so great it is hard to get an appointment. Almost always i get a week away appointment. But you can call  and see if there are any cancellations.</text>

<Review>Ive been looking for a place to take our pitbull and pug . I took the pug in  to get her nails trimmed. The staff was very friendly. They did a very good job on her nails. I'm very excited that we found a place that will finally take good care of our furry babies .< /Review>< date>

UPDATE: I went back and NO CUTS this time. They did a great job. They raised the price a bit, cost me a hundred and something to groom two small doggies. But they did great. Changed back to 5 stars.

So why not five stars? The golden question. I love clippendales. I think they are great but the last time that I went the lady that groomed my two dogs nicked them both a couple of different areas. Wouldn't have necessarily been as big of an issue if she had told me. One of them was pretty bad I didn't notice it until the next day and it had scabbed over. Don't get me wrong I will definitely be back but it would be nice if they are paying a close enough attention to see that they cut my dogs. They're also very reasonable and they do do a great job otherwise. I will probably end up revising this to Five Stars once I calm down a little bit. They are my babies.<//Text>

<review>I took my Poodle in for a trim and tidy. Susie the owner of the shop took charge of grooming my dog. As per my wife's instructions I got the exact cut that my wife wanted. The funny thing is, my wife wrote the instructions that I was to convey to the shop as to what type of hair cut she desired for our Poodle. I did the smart thing every man should do, I took the note to the groomer so I knew I would get it right.   This is to all men "remember your happy wife is your happy life".  Clippendale's pet grooming is a wise choice to a happy life.</review>< username>

He comes home smelling good and looking fluffy!  If you're looking for quality service with knowledgeable groomers you'll definitely find it here.  I appreciate going in and seeing the same smiling faces so I know hes always around someone familiar<//Text><UserId.>105413548926372476242</UserId.>< response>

I love this place! My mom had taken her dog here for years! So when we got our puppy, I knew exactly where I would be taking him. His first time was so great, we are looking forward to bringing him back many times.< /review>

They marked my package as delivered but it was obviously not delivered. I was home all day, I live in a building complex that has 24/7 front desk. It was a 77 lbs package that they claim they handed to the 'customer', but the package was never dropped off. My building even has security cameras to prove.

You can read the other comments and see that this center is pretty much running a scam and FedEx does not care.</review>

Fedex is Absolutely the worst business. I tried to call and talk to the 800 number where they told me there are no available supervisors from now thru the holidays and they had no clue if my package was on a truck like it said or in the ground location. After 4 days of it saying it was on a truck I finally went to the ground location. It took me over 30 minutes for them to find the package they told me was not there and was on a truck. While I was waiting for them to find the package I saw 8-10 employees coming and going with no masks. So yes if I could I would give FedEx -5 stars but 1 is all I can here.< /Review>

A FedEx driver called me in the morning of Thursday, April 1st asking if I wanted my package to be delivered that day. I've never gotten any phone calls prior to this instance about wanting a package delivered, so I was slightly confused but said "yes of course". I wonder what would have happened I didn't answer my phone by chance.

Following that day I get "Delivery exception
Future delivery requested" on my package status.
I live in an apartment building with front desk people 24/7 who sign packages for you so not having someone there isn't possible. The next day they said they will deliver on Monday, today, April 5th.
After waiting all day today for my $800 item I saw that my package suddenly lost any trace of information online so I attempted to contact and call Fedex. After going through automated chatting options online and on the phone that didn't help, I finally got ahold of someone who took my tracking number, name, and address JUST to transfer me to someone else who took my information all over again. The second representative was more helpful but I still have no idea when my package will arrive. They will supposedly contact me when they will attempt to deliver again. I made multiple plans with the item I ordered that will directly affect my networking and income and this is thoroughly disappointing.<//Text>

I never received the package that they supposedly delivered to my front door on 11/22/20. I was home all day. Their customer service in tracking this package is terrible. They provide No Help in locating the package nor do they get back to you with a human person... only texting your phone. I never once had this problem with their competitors: US Postal Service or UPS.<//Text>

The worst delivery business compares to their competitor. If tracking showed package on delivery truck out for delivery, just deliver the package on the same day. Why goes back to the facility and deliver 2 days later? This happened to me for last 3 deliveries consecutively. Why???< /text>

On numerous occasions, FedEx claimed to make a drop off and made no attempt at contacting the security desk at my office building when they were not there (number posted in case they step away); further claiming that no one was available. I’m here everyday and called customer support and gave my number to call when they arrived. Never received a call. Called about 7 times for one package and never got any follow up. Terrible customer service.< /text>

< Review>
Because of COVID we are home all the time. But yesterday FedEx decided to NOT call us from the call box to get access into the building. It was easier for them to put a 'we missed you' door tag and try again even though we were home! And AGAIN today, same story, they didn't buzz to get entry into the building. And put a door tag! Are they thinking we will wait in the front entrance of our apartment? This is the worst customer service ever. I run an ecommerce business and use UPS and USPS and this is why we never use FedEx. Perhaps it's just this one driver, but the customer service will not even help me! Very frustrating.</Review>

I was waiting for my backpack for 3 whole days. It is not even a big or heavy package!! I live in an apartment, and maybe that’s why the driver is too lazy to find the apartment?? Then I try to save them some time and have a delivery instruction saying that they can leave at the leasing office, someone can sign for it. They didn’t even do that!! Just keep saying that they attempted to deliver it. I mean what the heck are you talking about?!?! Can Fedex hire someone that’s reliable please?!?!</text>

<Text>FedEx ground at 1070 San Mateo Ave. is the WORST. This is the first and last time I’ll be using their service. I left probably 10 voicemails and nobody is returning my call whatsoever. I suppose to receive package on 4/6 and now is 4/18 and no action has been done. Then, at some point I went to there location to pick up the package and guess what the can’t find it and after waiting for an hour I left. The guy named Greg told me that they will find it and ship it tomorrow to my address first thing next morning, I waited 5 days and still no package. Start calling again and leaving the voicemails, still no callback. But, here is the best part: this morning I received a text saying that since package wasn’t PICKED UP in time they are sending back to sender. THEY ARE THE WORST!   And now I don’t know what to do, I still don’t have my package!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

They are awful I called on Tuesday to have my package held they did not Hold it instead I did not receive my package at all. When they finally did hold it it wasn’t ready until Friday and I had a business meeting on Wednesday. Then when you look up the address it doesn’t show which location in South San Francisco so now I have to wait till Monday to get my package the worst service ever all the time</text>

<Review>Just like several other reviewers on here, I stayed home to receive my package, which was about 50 pounds. However, the driver not even knocked my door and when I checked the package’s status online, it said that they attempted delivery while they clearly didn’t. I understand this package might have been heavy for the driver but if he/she cannot do the job properly then why is he/she still working?

After a few “delivery attempts”, I decided to bite the bullet and came to this facility to pick up the package myself. BUT, I had to wait over 40 minutes for them to give it to me. From now on, when purchasing anything online, I will explicitly ask the seller NOT to ship it with FedEx.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Review>I had no idea how incompetent FedEx Ground is until my recent experience. Unfortunately it's similar to what others have posted here. TL;DR: Don't bother trying to pick up in person from here, it will likely fail.

Here's the whole story:
1. It took a week to deliver a package from this delivery terminal to San Francisco.
2. Despite days-long exceptions, no-one investigated proactively. They relied me as the recipient to alert them about issues.
3. They never actually could tell where the package actually is – the tracking did not reflect reality.
4. Inquiring about the actual location and status of a package takes 24-48 hours – and doesn't yield any results; they will not call you.
5. Customer support cannot reach a delivery terminal directly but has to leave a voice message.
6. When trying to pick up the package from the delivery terminal in person, the staff claimed the package was not there and the tracking code invalid – both were not true.
7. They delivered the item in the afternoon of the next day – after the merchant had cancelled delivery/turned it around the night before.
8. Then they delivered a second package from the merchant that had been turned around 2 days before, gained access to my apartment building despite my explicit wish to refuse the delivery, and dumped it in the building lobby without the required signature.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< user>

<Review>Apparently, the driver attempted to deliver a package 3 times, never leaving a door tag. This package didn’t require a signature, so he could have left it in the apartment building as has happened with every other package but he failed to do so. The company was not accommodating and said I would get a call to pick up at the SSF location. At 5:45 I called to see why I hadn’t been contacted and they said the location closes at 6 and the driver probably wasn’t even back yet as he has until 8. So I got stuck dealing with his failures negatively affecting me and my job.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

An honest, hard working person deserves this job, not someone who is lazy and deceitful.<//review>

Horrible delivery service. Management needs to fix this. Package left Sacramento Wednesday morning. Didn’t get scanned into South SF until 26 hours later. Was out for delivery Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday but never delivered. They claimed bad weather on both Thursday and Sunday., no excuse for Friday and that we weren’t home on Saturday. None of which were valid. Even phone calls to customer service did me no good. I don’t think this office understands that the “Ex” in FedEx stands for “Express”. I’ve told the shipper they should get their money back<//Text>

<Text>ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!!!
I shipped a package “2 Day Shipping” 8 days later my package has NOT been delivered. The website keeps updating to “restriction, no delivery attempted” or “Will Deliver Tomorrow” And EVERYDAY it indicates “On FedEx truck for delivery”
I’ve called EVERY DAY trying to sort out what’s  happened to my package, but nobody even seems to know WHERE my package is! It’s not small. It weights almost 50lbs. A little hard to lose.
I shipped early to avoid the Christmas rush and still can’t get a pack to arrive on time???
Come on FedEx. There’s CLEARLY NO ONE from FedEx reading all the 1 star reviews.
The service center can’t even get these guys to respond to complaints, let alone ANSWER THE PHONE!<//Text>< Date>

This is the second delivery in two weeks that Fedex has left downstairs by the mailboxes, rather than leaving it by my door.  I live on a busy street, with people walking by all day long.  The packages were left out in the open in the driveway. FedEx has no problem blocking my driveway, but they can’t bring the packages to my door?

Someone is highly overpaid and not doing their job.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>The worst customer service!!!

FedEx ground doesn’t deliver late in San Francisco. I guess they expect everyone to work from home or got rich from a VC venture because all drivers vacate the city by 3:30 pm. Then on top of that there’s no pick up site in San Francisco. If you drive to the South San Francisco. Which on a good day is about 30 minutes away by car without traffic. The FedEx ground facility isn’t even a customer service place. You have talk to a security guard and write down your tracking number. FedEx Ground is just about the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER. I will be making no one who uses FedEx to never ship using FedEx ground.

FedEx Ground has to be more accountable and accommodating to the recipient customers. I have had such a bad experience I’m reporting this to the BBB.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I can share some of previous recessions. The driver who should deliver my package didn't take time to ring the bell and at least try to deliver the package! Instead, he just tagged the sheet at my door, although I was at home waiting for my package. Worst service I've ever experienced! Maybe the management of this place should rebrief their drivers! Come on guys, it's your f****** job to deliver the package, just do it!< /text>

<text>Being one of the most expensive services available one would assume a certain level of competence would be evident. I was promised my package on a Wednesday of no determined specific window of time ( this means I have my day hijacked until they decide to deliver). By late that evening I checked the tracking number again only to be told that no estimate of delivery is determined. Even later they finally decide (once my entire day has been thrown away by this situation) to promise Thursday delivery. I patiently wait until the same status updates appear. Knowing that my package was at the nearest ground delivery center since 2am the previous day I am now seeing that this is not a one time mistake, these things happen but now I feel like it's a problem that the company has with doing it's job effectively.  I call because I don't have time to waste and this package is important for something I have to present by monday morning for finals. I am told that I will be contacted by FedEx the next morning confirming some manageable ETA. The call never comes and to make it worse now the status update tells me that the package I have wasted 3 days waiting for in vane is now not expected to be delivered until some undetermined time Monday! I cannot except this type of treatment even from the cheapest service available so to know that FedEx being pricier than the other companies treats my time like this is a pure insult and a disgusting display of what I see as a disrespectful lack of integrity. The only number provided by FedEx puts me in contact with someone who has no control or influence on the status of my package. My complaints need to be heard by someone who is in charge and honestly, the only honorable action at this point to redeem this behavior is if a manager from the local shipping center hand delivered my package before the sun goes down today! It costs me $15 and 2.5-3 hours of my time to go to san Francisco and pick this up. I have let your company spit in my face in regard to time and your service is too costly as it is for me to do this and let it be okay. I will do everything in my power from here on out to not only avoid your service but also make sure that other people don't end up being taken advantage of or lead on by your lack of professionalism and disregard for the customers time and money< /text>< pictures>

Can't pin bad on all FedEx Ground Drivers / Dept. But as soon as my package got to CA it took an extra week before I said , ENOUGH!!!!!  THE PACKAGE WAS ON THEIR TRUCK THE WHOLE TIME AND THEY NEVER TRIED TO DELIVER IT.
I had to go out of my way to get it at the SSF location where the truck return after the day is over. The guy at the Customer Service Greg was very professional and helpful to recover my package the next day.
This STAR is for Greg wish I could give him More but I've done too much already.
Wal-mart uses Fed-Ex Ground to deliver their goods, this is not the first time Fed-Ex delivery was a fail.
Poor Management leads to poor work ethics.< /text>

After my package was already a week late, I finally called FedEx to pickup the package myself. Prior to Ubering to this location I called FedEx to ensure it’s  availability for pickup. The operator informed me it 100% be ready until they closed at 4pm. This was false and a waste of $30 in Uber fees. I arrive at 10am only to find out its “impossible” to grab my package from a truck which is on the premise. Impression I got from their employee was that they’re just lazy. The QA person at the warehouse told me their operators only want to get off the phone quickly and provide poor customer service. He was correct in that statement, but also provided poor customer service himself. On top of a package being a week late, I’m now out $60 in Uber fees.

They could only guarantee me it would arrive on Monday. If that’s the case, then why didn’t it arrive on time?</review>

<text>I know of at least one driver that works out of here lies...  Caught them in video not not attempting to deliver package.  Just walked up, slapped the “not available” sticker on the lobby door.  Too lazy to come in and take elevator.  If he lies about this, no telling what else he lies about while on his route.

FedEx, UPS has no problem performing the bare minimum of at least attempting to deliver package.< /text>< Pictures>

I can’t believe how frustrating the drivrs are. The package is 71 lbs furniture box. I was waiting at home all day to get it delivered but the driver noted that “customer unavailable”. He didn’t even leave any door tag to prove that he attempted. Then second day, same thing “customer unavailable” even though I was waiting for him all day. So I called customer service and complained. I gave them the gate code since it’s gated condos incase he gave the excuse of being unable to get in. Third day, I was expecting that he will actually deliver it because I talked to customer service and complained. Unbelievably, he lied again and claimed he attempted to deliver at 1:07pm and “customer available”.  I saw that online message 10mins after and so frustrated. I had been checking all cars coming in and out the gate cos I was given time frame for estimated delivery from customer service representative. Eventually, I gave up and decided to pick it up. The moral of the story is “FEDEX DRIVERS NEVER BOTHER TO DELIVER HEAVY PACKAGES!” This is the last time dealing with FedEx and I’ll tell my vendors to always use UPS.<//Text>

<Review>Package was too big for me to pick up. Tracking said delivery would happen the next business day and nothing happened for about two weeks during which someone had to stay home. I called at least 5 times. Either no one picked up, or they said they'd deliver the next day and didnt or said they didnt know when they can deliver it. Only after contacting the seller on Ebay who talked to them they finally delivered. Unfriendly and unhelpful staff.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808f79c935d7fe65:0x18bbeb2c8f3c0ac4<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Still waiting on my package since Saturday- They lied and said no one was home when I was here all day. Then when I called customer service they said a supervisor was going to call me - still no call. I called back CS said it would be here Monday- another lie when I called back they said sorry that home delivery doesn’t work Monday then the said we will GUARANTEE it by Tuesday well that is today I called cause still no package and they said that they DONT KNOW why my package wasn’t delivered today and to wait until tomorrow and someone will call me to explain why and they still don’t know when my package will be here. This is a nightmare and this facility needs to be shut down.</Text>

The company and employees are wholly incompetent. From customer service over the phone to the staff working the facility(Thanks Sergei!). I personally will never use FedEx unless there is no other option< /Text>

First delivery said would be delivered last Friday...took the day off from work to be sure someone was home for them to deliver to door and the packages never came..next scheduled for Tuesday...came home Monday and they had thrown two 100# boxes with chairs in them over my gate into my landscaping and busted the chairs!! Re-ordered chairs with specific delivery date for someone to be home (next Tuesday) reassures three times they would get delivered on TUESDAY come home today and there are two boxes 100# each left in front of the gate on the street side in front of the basement apartment! So now I have two busted up boxes in my landscaping waiting for retrieval and two others at the wrong door and I have a bad back and can’t lift!!!</review>< Rating>

<name>Kristin Thomas</name><Time>1503975933096< /Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I placed an order for a new mattress (compressed in a box weighing 85 lbs) through Amazon that was supposed to be delivered on a Thursday via FedEx ground. Per the amazon shipping notifications the package was riding around on a truck alllll Thursday without being delivered. I received notification that the package was back at the warehouse and couldn't be delivered for an unknown reason. I called the 800 and was advised that my mattress would be delivered on Fri. I checked the website Fri morning to ensure that my package was out for delivery... guess what??? It hadn't been scanned and showed as still sitting in the warehouse. I called the 800 and was told that the tracking website isn't always updated and that she saw that my package was on a truck and out for delivery, Flash forward to Friday night... still no package. I call again and an investigation has now been opened so they can tell why it still hasn't been delivered. Within a 1/2 hour I receive a call from Lisa who says she spoke with a station agent who didn't know why my package hadn't been placed on a truck but guaranteed it would be delivered on Monday. It is now Monday..... still no mattress. I called again and was actually transferred to the location because  the station agent advised that they could not locate my package in the warehouse.... OMFG How in the entire F do you lose an 85lb box????? I proceeded to ask Mary Ann this exact question. She advised that since she was talking to me she was unable to go and look for it, and that once she got off the phone with me, and it was found I could come and pick it up. Are you F'ING serious. I told her I want it delivered and asked that my phone be given to a supervisor and that I can be called once it is out for delivery. She was completely unprofessional and clearly FedEx ground is an unorganized mess.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>If zero rating  is an option i would do so- they were suppose to deliver on Saturday - driver lied and said he attempted but we are unavailable then they said Monday - when we called they said that was a mistake they dont deliver mondays.. they have holiday - Guaranteed Tuesday - today again and when i called they said no it will have to be tomorrow and that they didnt have an explanation... customer service agent says they won't help because that's the service we choose.. but we didnt the amazon seller choose and i have no control... Well best help she can give is let the delivery fail 3 times and we can collect it🤣... was like.. I waited more than a week. To get it delivered...Then week for you to fail...And then you may provide me the contact details of the transit office... What a pathetic service by fedex...

Each day the package was supposed to come. Each day I called to ensure that they had the right directions. Each day the package is promised to come by EOD. Each day that changes to the next day. Insanely frustrating waste of time.<//review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) I don't understand why there is a FedEx delivery point near my home. They want to put my parcel here and notify me to take it. (At this time, four days have passed since they failed to send. I am not at home. This ghost place is 16 kilometers from the apartment I live in.

Good service. Fast order and pick up for take out. I like the green beans. Onion rings were a little more crispy than I like. But were good. Tried the chick sandwich. Gonna stick to burgers. Not a place for chickens.< /text>

<review>Service was good,
Last week the double char. was good.
Today I ordered the same and I was greatly disappointed.
The burger was very salty. One able to eat about 1/2 and through the rest of the way.
Onion rings were good.< /review>< userid>

I usually get the chicken club sandwich and sometimes share it with my mom. It's always a good day when I eat there. I guess I have a small stomach but I usually eat half and eat the other half later. The one time I actually eat the leftovers, ya know?
They also do not donate to hate groups or organizations.

<Text>Went to the habit for the first time. Got the Santa Barbara with bacon. The burger was good I really liked the bread. Onion rings were good also! Sweet potato fries were a little bland. Wish it had a little more salt. The ranch was good also! All in all was about $25 which i felt wasn’t bad considering 2 drinks, bacon and all that jazz. Will return.<//Text>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I ordered a dbl cheese burger with raw red onions. I received an ooey gooey MESS! Mayo was slathered on as if it came from oil can. The cheese was this awful melted guck. Instead of raw onions as ordered they were partially cooked. Appeared that the cook realized oops these are supposed to be raw, let me take them off of the grill. HORRIBLE!

<Review>Horrible place. Don't order from there. I got lost when I got there I asked if they could give me a new burger since it was cold. And the manager Erika said no. She didn't want to give me her name and they also gave me the store manager name Lim Gemma. I will call the corporation office to report this because this is the only location they always treat you very bad. They really should fired the manager . She truly does not know what a manager does</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The ingredients are fresh, the burgers; sublime. The Habit Burger APP is a must for quick and easy ordering. Ready in minutes. Run in and grab your order, no wait, no currency exchange. Have delicious burgers and wondrous sides on your table in a snap! I guarantee the Habit Burger side selection will outshine plain old frenchfries by leaps. Try it. You're gonna like it.</Text>

Always made fresh to order! Friendly service! But if you are going to go during the lunch rush hour, I suggest that you place your order ahead... either online or by phone.</Review>

I really like the habit burger.  Good food, good people. This new location is on a busy intersection but there is plenty of parking to be had.  Try their original char but i reallu enjoy their veggie burger and portabello char.</Text>

I liked the food had a delicious double cheese burger, but I don't know why where I was sitting or if it's always like this but I went in with shorts on a hot summer day and I was freezing inside. I think it could get someone sick from entering and leaving the restaurant.</text>

< review>
There should be a direct phone number to the location itself so costumers can make special requests when ordering online since it isn’t an option. The phone number listed on here sends you through a queue where a rep at a center only accepts takeout orders, but will not reach out to the actual location if you need to speak to someone regarding the order you placed online. Doesn’t seem like a local restaurant, more like corporation. Sad.</review>

I have come here since they opened about twice a week. The food was great at first but lately not so perfect. The chicken not so tender and overcooked and the bacon. Bug issue here little flying bugs. They also let someone in here with a small dog. I think this will be the last time I eat at this Habit. Update 2-4-18 Ok tried them again several times. Better now maybe your reading this post. Keep it up please. Very good when they cook it right.</Text>

<review>I always go here, great staff. However, this morning i went in and ordered a southern bbq salad. Got the salad fairly quick (about 5 mins.) The lady asked if i wanted the dressing. I was obviously confused because they include it regardless, i pass this and just say yeah. She turns around and fiddles for a while, i realize either she forgot or she is stalling. I eventually leave without it because she completely ignored me after. I get home and realize no utensils and maybe about 6 little pieces of chicken along with a poor amount of ingredients. I love this place but idk about returning to that morning shift.<//review>< gmap_id>

Decided to finally try the habit after hearing from a few colleagues how good the burgers are. Not as good as they make it sound. Burgers are probably frozen and thawed then cooked.

Not fresh like other burger joints out there. Freshness makes a difference and I think that is where they are lacking. Plus the fries are lame, I didn't bother to eat them after trying them.<//Text>

<text>POOR FOOD HANDLING BY MANGER..
i just talk and told both managers..
I watched one of the managers touch everything he could at the front counter, including... Money, all doors and watched him answer his cell phone (have it on video) and PALM a customer's french fries open handed to put in the bottom of the bag..
He was not wearing gloves nor did he wash his hands. (He could of just got back from the bathroom) FULL PALM PALMED BASKET OF FRIES..
I asked him who is the MANGER  (He said he was) and another guy said we both are... i told him what i saw and walked out....
NEW PLACE BUT NO REASON FOR THAT...
food was good...
I hope they fix this cause if they don't wash thier hands I'm sure NO ONE WILL...</text><pictures>None</pictures><rate>3</rate>< Time>

<review>This location has gotten super bad by the day. If you decide to come make sure you repeat your self many times because the staff are very distracted with other things happening at the counter.  Revise your order before you leave. The French fries here are like MD's
super brown I gues they need to save money on the oil!!! You need to change it more often.  Where's your moto " there's no substitute for quality". Well.......</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Poor customer service. It's a shame, food can be good, but their customer service is very poor. They act like they got the top shelf, we really don't have to go there.< /Review>

Service was bad food was almost half an hour later than they said it'd be. Didn't get my full order despite the guy saying everything was in the bag. Tried calling about it. System basically says if you have a problem go online then disconnects you. When I finally did get a human on the phone I explained the situation in detail to which he replied "uuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh what are you calling about?"< /review>

Overrated. Overpriced. Could be more concerned with customer satisfaction.
Decently clean, great drink choices. Just another Carl's Jr. Paying restaurant priced for fast-food. Save yourself the trouble and go to a In-and-Out or the Chipotle nextdoor<//Review>

<text>Service was slow and the quality of the food was so so. I ordered my food to go in the restaurant. I ate my burger in the car and it was already luke warm which tells be it sat for a few minutes while they were finishing the rest of my order. The fries were over cooked and the 2nd burger I ate made my tummy turn. Not sure if this was an off day for them but I wasn't happy with my meal.</text><user_id>116284586075451737159< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2ccd6102b88dd:0xd4658697dbfa6a7d<//gmap_id>< time>
