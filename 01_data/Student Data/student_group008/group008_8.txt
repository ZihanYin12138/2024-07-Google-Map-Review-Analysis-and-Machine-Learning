<text>I absolutely love going here! I’ve been coming here for years, and it’s owned by a husband and wife - they are so sweet and kind! These were my gel nails from yesterday, they turned out perfect!! They also have an amazing nail artist on staff who did jade marble and gold flakes on acrylics for my sister!!!!<//text>< Pictures>

I had a broken nail that I was worried about and the manager took it upon herself to fix it for me and show me how to care for it while it heals! which was very sweet and appreciated.

I have been a customer for over 15 years and am extremely happy with their quality of service and cleanliness.  Truc is a professional who takes pride in her work.  I am so happy that Lux Beauty is once again open for business and encourage everyone to come and find out for themselves the wonderful service they will find.< /Text>

<text>Really good service, used to go to another local place but tried out this one, as it's closer to our house. They did a great job on our first visit for my and my wife's pedicures. Will definitely come back again.  Prices are on par with other places near by. I wish they had online booking for appointment however.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKxtlau9f2O9LUPQoWex_6SlKMRZPqlcGL-ulV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBqgzeEHKmx9C5TYYsWHta4li3qRhtTkxg3lcm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ-Ny2pWyaCm50PtZWPhiGI8QiG2wEje2VXL1R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJDDoqhB41XAuPM27tWgY4KuEvNNqBWevb_8mv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>This place is great, big and clean, staff is always sweet. Sadly wasn’t happy with my last mani, Quinny wasn’t very careful with my gel mani and the mi cuticles has color in it, is gel so non removal. Don’t get me wrong, this is my fav nail place in MTV, but I will just go for Ponica next time, she’s the best.</Text>< Pics>

The employees were so friendly and welcoming. The gel manicure and pedicure were done to perfection and never felt rushed. The cost felt a bit high, as I paid ~$80. I give the location five stars because of the cleanliness, attention to detail, great color selection and friendly staff. I will be back!</text>

I came here for a pedicure. They talked me into the $55 jelly pedicure, which meant my feet were in cold jello instead of hot water. It wasn't really pleasurable; it seemed like a gimmick. The prices are higher than many nail salons in the area.

The salon is nice, spacious, and clean. They also have wifi.

The pedicurist spoke good English, which is nice if you want to have a conversation, but I wanted to catch up on email on my laptop, and she kept trying to talk to me anyway.< /text>

Nice staff, clean facility, and great pedicure.  I was impressed by the considerable amount of time they spent doing my spa mani-pedi.  The menu said it would be 50 minutes for the pedicure and they didn't scrimp (I did go at a slower time).  If I didn't live on the east coast, I'd come back regularly.<//review>

<name>Shaden Amleh< /name><date>1539706966242</date><Rate>2< /Rate><text>If I wrote the review the time Lux started their business, I would put 5 stars.  But to be honest my last two visits were a BIG disappointment.  My review will be a bit long but bare with me.  When I first knew this place I was so happy I found the perfect place with the great service and that is why I gave two stars, but now it is so sad that they have a lot of customers, their service is going downhill.  I visited Lux beauty salon on a Saturday two weeks ago and when I entered, there was nobody on the reception area, but the receptionist saw me and was asking me how can she help me and I answered that I am there for a pedi & mani.  She asked me again and I answered but she still asked me a third time and her question this time was (What do you want?) I was like ha? wow what do I want?I am sure I am not there to make friends....  I left the store to come back after 30 minutes.  I was so tempted to write them a review but I said maybe they are busy today and I will give them another chance.  So I decided to go on a week day this time (Which I usually do) but that was the end of it.  They were not busy but they kept changing the ladies who worked on my nails.  the lady who did my mani was arguing with me on how to call the shape  of my nails (I don't have long nails,and call it whatever you want) the lady who took over pulled my cuticles really bad that my finger started bleeding.  She did not even apologize. The lady who was doing my Pedi , did a very lousy job that the color was not even.  At one point she had to pull my leg and I had a VERY PAINFUL CRAMP on my leg that lasted until next day.  This is a very pricy place, if they kept the same service they did when they first started, I would not mind paying them the money (I used to go every other week) but with this bad service and chaotic place there is no way to go back to this salon anymore. If anybody have a good recommendation please let me know.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb09eb10ffe93:0xfae89bdb282b5e45<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Made an appointment was so excited to come and get a pedi for my bday!! I came a little early for my appointment one of the lady got my water ready to soak my feet...but I had to wait for the lady who was supposed to do my pedi but she was taking long and never once said a word to me at all...my water got cold so I walked out of there with my feet wet...worst experience!!👹👹👹<//text>

< Review>
We made a reservation for 2 spa pedicures and when we arrived they did not have any chairs available asked if we could sit at the manicure station instead. Disappointed because that’s the best part of a pedicure and confused why they didn’t understand this was not acceptable<//Review>

The worst experince that I had. I got my nails done two times  and it is gross . I went there to remove it and have a refund. They were rude to me and they rejected it and told me I have to pay for removing.I was so upset and just leave a place And the manager told me go away!!!< /review>

<review>is it called dominos because you roll the dice that they get your order right? idk what changed but  pizza places when messing up your order would make you a fresh pie , now they offer to add the toppings and rewarm the pizza and free garlic sauce? lmao<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dcd880c28107b1:0x5557b5a1cb5d6fc9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
They just don’t care. I called to see after an hour of my order saying still prepping in app status and he’s like ok yeah well it’s a 2 hour wait oh well nothing I can do about that but if I had known that I wouldn’t have ordered and the app gives you no indication of an estimated delivery time ... it would’ve been nice for him to pretend like he cared I guess but his demeanor on the phone was so unprofessional. I guess if I were to ever order from here again I better call first to see what the wait time is or order from Pizza Hut or papa John’s or anywhere with this type of customer service< /Review>

The food was amazing the store was kinda a disaster they had no napkins plates or cups and I believe I was way over charged but that's just me. I used a coupon so i went there expecting a certain price.... The atmosphere felt like there is a bunch of high school kids working.< /review>

Nobody was wearing gloves. One of the workers doing toppings had his mask below his nose and rubbed it repeatedly without washing his hands. Doesn't look like any food safety measures were taken by anyone.<//review>

< Review>
Delivery person was nice, and pizza didnt take long to arrive, but the sad
thing was the  order I did  online was for a ham and mushroom pizza and recieved only 2 small pcs of ham on my pizza and the pizza wasnt evenly cut.  I called in to complain and whoever answered only had to say thank for letting us know.

I don't  think I'll  order again.< /Review>

<review>I placed an order last night and waited in my living room.  Nobody knocks nobody rings the bell but I get a notification that my food has been delivered. I try and call to see where my food is and the first time I called someone answered the phone and hung up on me. The second time I called I had to cut off the person before they hung up on me and explained the situation. She then told me I would have to wait an hour and a half for the driver to come back and I should just cancel order. I told her I could  come and pi k it up and she said I would have to wait for the driver to get back to their location which would still take an hour and a half. I told her I would wait because I was hungry and didn't have anything to eat at home. Two hours later I still had no food but I was charged for the pizza. When I called this morning to get a refund I was told the manager would not be in until tomorrow. If you want food and to not waste your money go anywhere elsewhere.< /review></record>

Unfortunately, I have to write a bad review for our business ordered a pizza...Hour later we called and man answered phone and was rude about giving us information on status of our pizza.

Even after an hour the pizza was not made or delivered.  So sad that the workers are not representing the owner's business in the proper fashion.< /Text>

< Review>
Since moving to the area I always order from this location and every time I’ve had a delivery so far, all drivers have been incredibly polite and I always receive my orders quickly. I have to specifically give a shoutout to Matthew(??? I hope that’s right) who made and delivered our food this most recent time because he was absolutely excellent, best customer service I’ve ever had. Our food was delivered so quickly and upon arrival, Matthew was so kind and endearing. He let us know that he made our food himself back at the shop and hoped that it was made to perfection. Well, Matthew, it was spot on fantastic. We’d been craving pizza all day and you seriously hit the spot for us. Sure, dominos is a chain and all but you killed it, best delivery I’ve had from Dominos so far! Absolutely well done! I also work in a fast-paced, food service job and I know how hard it is to keep your spirits up sometimes because, truth be told, customers are sh*theads. But you kept your customer service on point and were genuinely a lovely human being. I hope you get to read this review or your management sees it and gives you the praise you deserve because you were awesome and your genuine kindness made mine and my husband’s day. Keep rockin’ on my friend!<//Review>

12/15/2020- I took my son for a dental treatment and they did an amazing job! I’m beyond happy for all the reviews I read prior to scheduling an appointment because they are 100% correct. I recommend this office for children in need of minor or major dental issues.
Thank you for helping us!</review>

<review>We have been taking our children to this office for the past two years. My almost 4 year old had treatment done for the first time and we had a wonderful experience. He has his crown and filling done awake with nitrogen oxide and local anesthetic and the doctor made the experience very easy for my son. We have more treatment to be done and I am happy to know he is in good hands.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I have 4 kids and this office is super helpful in arranging appointments so I don’t have to make 4 separate trips for cleanings. Also my 2 oldest daughters had ortho treatment and recently had their braces removed, and well Dr. Irma is amazing. My girls always looked forward to seeing her and all the office staff. Thank you Dr. Irma and everyone at Five Cities pediatric dental<//Review>

New to the area, and received a referral from a friend to try out 5 cities.  They are fantastic!  All of the staff are helpful and friendly.  They do a great job with both kids and parents, explaining everything thoroughly and easing any anxiety.  We also are in and out quickly, with little, if any, wait times.  Great place!<//text>

<Review>They have been tremendously empathetic, helpful, and understanding about my anxious child's dental treatments. We have gone here for years and will continue to do so for a long time. I appreciate how helpful the staff is and how knowledgeable and approachable the orthodontist and dentist both are. They take the time to answer all my questions, patiently explain (and re-explain) what treatments are needed, and have been extremely responsive to our needs. We recommend them unequivocally!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

My children were very happy and comfortable. My husband and I as well and are very satisfied with the service. The staff and doctors are great! Very professional and kind. We felt welcome and the doctors and staff demonstrate that they really care about their patients. Everything is very well explained and staff makes sure to hear out any concerns we may have. I am really glad we made the decision to bring our children to this office and look forward to continue in the future. Thank you Dr. Giancarlo and staff! Best pediatric dental office hands down!</Review>

Really warm, caring, friendly, knowledgeable Pediatric Dentists. The dentists and staff are 100% successful at making nervous patients (and parents!) feel completely at ease. Beautiful, impeccably clean, modern office. Everyone is professional and just exceptionally nice. My kids' dental appointments have been a painful hassle elsewhere in the past, but at Five Cities Pediatric Dental Group it has all gone easily and smoothly. Highly recommended!</review>

<Text>Very friendly staff, beautiful clean office, great dentists! Met both Dr Irma and Dr Lauriente, and loved them both. They clearly explained what they were doing and what the next step was in treatment.  My kids were all comfortable with the staff, and especially loved watching movies on the ceiling while their teeth were being cleaned :)

I would highly recommend taking your children to Five Cities Pediatric Dental group.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My daughter had another wonderful experience, even though she’s on the verge of some cavities 😩😩 Was given excellent advice for helping our daughter have a better visit next time. Amazing staff and awesome office. Thank you!</text>

Been going to this place since I was young. Very expansive, with lots of things to do. Many holidays are celebrated here, with great shows and performances. With the drought, the lack of flowing water hurts, but once the pond comes back, it'll be fantastic again!<//review>

Lots of birds and bird poop. They have a nice grass field, baseball field, tennis courts, fountains. Usually the water, fountains are not on either due to it being summer or the drought. There is also a playground, and an outdoor theater for plays.

Nice location, next to De Anza College, the Oaks for food. Quiet place with benches as well.<//review>

Came here for cherry blossom festival. It was very well organized. Very nice and neat park. Plenty of space to play with kids, pets, throw a frisbee or have a picnic. Fountain had no water, but that's related to ongoing drought. Plenty of parking - there is dedicated parking, street parking as well as few large stores nearby.< /Text>

I can't wait for CA to get out of this drought and bring children to play in the water. PS: it's a great place to go some Pokemon hunt ;) There are a lot of lures active in during weekend and tons of people are hunting Pokemon there.</Text>

<Text>This is a nice and beautiful park; however, its pounds are empty for few years already what suppresses overall impress significantly.
They say, it was marvelous with blue and shiny pounds full of water.< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
This dog park is new to me, although it has clearly been around for a while. For example, the fencing has clearly been repaired more than once, and the tall brick wall that separates the highway from the dog park has a couple of painted over patches to hide graffiti. However, the park itself is probably almost a quarter of an acre, and has big old trees, fresh water available, real grass!, lots of shade and places to sit for the humans, and (from what I can tell) a friendly and welcoming community. Oddly, the small dog park is just a shadeless, fenced-in patch of spiky sand. I've seen fast running dogs actually tear up their paws on that sand, so I don't know why anyone would want to use it! Stick to the large dog park - it's beautiful and I highly recommend it. Also, if you want to, you can leash your dog and walk around with them in the rest of the park - there's a small lake at the other end, lots of trees and greenery, curving paths, picnic tables, and other nice stuff. It's generally just a very pleasant looking place.

Later edit: now I know what the smaller, grassless section of dog park is for - they use it for the dogs to run and play in when the large, grassy part is very wet and/or muddy. I think this is great -- it means that the grassy Park stays grassy rather than becoming a torn up mud pit. The rangers make sure it all stays nice too, which I appreciate. Still an excellent park for dogs!<//review>

<Review>This is a very scenic, well kept, relatively clean, not muddy, spacious, and enjoyable dog park.  My wife and our boxer really enjoy it compared to some of the few parks more deep in the middle of San Jose as this one has a more respectful crowd, has beautiful surroundings, and nice amenities (water buckets, nice public restroom, benches/chairs). It's a great spot.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>The lot and park was empty when my wife, my dog and I arrived at or around 3pm.  There is water in the gated dry and grass area for the pups.  The parked filled pretty quickly with walkers n pup's.  We were looking for a safe place to park and  let time go by because we arrived two days early for our resort reservation.  There is no places we know of that provides parking and we were exhausted from an 8 hour drive.< /review><gmap_id>0x808e2d8a9c1fcb11:0x6b60a09706fc1e26</gmap_id>< user>

<date>1546666603868</date><rating>3<//rating><review>This is an ok dog park. Parking costs $6. The dog park is fenced of into two areas for small and large dogs. Overall both spaces are open and large but have little grooming.

On the day we visited the ground was very wet and muddy despite not having rain for over a week. Honestly I think there better parks that available at no cost.

If you have children there is a great play structure in the other side of the park, which can offset the cost of parking with other non dog activities<//review>< pictures>

Great park! Big space and real grass which is a huge bonus. It’s really nice and a great place to just walk around with your pet. Also there is a path that will take you to the park on the other side.<//review>

We find this a convenient rest stop off of 101 easy on and off for either Southbound or Northbound travelers.  Bathroom is across from the dog park.  No charge to enter and exit for quick stop and go.</review>

<time>1600974419458<//time><resp>None<//resp><Text>Nice pictures of green grass and shade, but apparently this part of the park is CLOSED all day on Wednesday for “maintenance”? So then you have to go to the other side of the trail where there’s a dry patch of fenced off dirt. This side doesn’t look like it gets maintenanced.
Has water and poop bags available. Some big trees right in the middle. Overall a very dusty area. Dogs require bath after a visit here and also got paw injuries.
Was told because of COVID they’re not charging entrance fee into the park (Hellyer County Park), cool. But even if the green side was open I’m not sure I would pay just to get to the dog park.< /Text><UserId.>102962799438527322889< /UserId.>< Rate>

Fun place for dogs. It's huge and will maintained so dogs enjoy a lot.
FYI, there is no division for small dogs and big dogs, so be prepared for it. But the park is big enough to scatter around.< /review>

<Review>Two sides, dirt and grass. Dirt side is pretty standard, rectangular, and dusty. Grass side seems to be closed more often than not, perhaps due to over-irrigation. When it is open, the grass side is more square-like and more shade and benches. Beware, that the outermost gate on the grass side isn't all that secure and a dog can run out if they're trying to chase squirrels</Review><Gmap_id>0x808e2d8a9c1fcb11:0x6b60a09706fc1e26<//Gmap_id>< resp>

The dog park isnt separated as other parks I've went to where you have a small dog park designated area and a large dog park area. Although they do have 2 sides to the dog park they only utilize the large size dog park. I'm not sure why buts it's been  like this for some time now. They need to separate the dogs.<//Text>

<review>Actually 2 dog parks.   Nice, big, grassy, well-shaded dog park and a gravel dog park which they will sometimes open if the other is closed for maintenance or weather.  You can pay admission to drive into Hellyer Park and park close, or you can park outside the Tuers Rd gate and walk a short path to get there.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The cool, shady, grass area is no longer open, which was really nice, but now just the dusty, gravel side is available....don't wear your nice shoes and there isn't separate areas for small and large dogs. Also, you will have to pay $6 for parking unless you park near the back trail entrance and walk in, its a short walk.</review>

< review>
By San Jose standards, this facility is awesome. Separate areas for large and small dogs; double gated; fresh water; real grass; ENORMOUS fenced area; lots of shade; big trees. The only problem is...there's often no dogs. What fun is that? This place is usually empty because you either need to pay an entrance fee to Hellyer park or park your car in front of someone's house in a nearby neighborhood.</review>

So much room for the dogs to get their exercise for the day.

Some dog parents have left toys at park for others to play with.

There is also a water spicket for humans to drink from and also a faucet to fill water containers, ie..<//Text>

<text>I love this dog park because there are 2 large fenced in areas. One is grass and the other is sand & dirt mix. The 2nd area is open when there has been large amounts of rain causing the grass area to become muddy.</text><user>106079302417271886607<//user>< date>

Nice thrift store. Easy to navigate. Pretty clean. Fun sales, lots of selection and nice employees will definitely keep me coming back. I have found tons of bargains, and some rare nick nacks . I like that everything is well priced and in good condition. Not a lot of broken or dirty products here. Come with cash, a smile and a truck, you'll need it.< /review>

This is one of my most favorite thrift shops. Whenever I am over in Angels Camp I make it a point to ALWAYS stop in and I never leave empty handed.

The employee's are terrific! The merchandise is fantastic! The prices are amazing! And the store is so well organized!

On the first few days of every month statewide 1/2 price sale. You cannot beat that!

Make sure to stop in and check things out for yourselves. I promise you will not be disappointed that you did.
Happy Thrifting! Enjoy! 😊👗👚👜👔👡👢👖</Text>

I have used this thrift store for 3 years and they have saved me a fortune, and I have provided them with plenty to resell as well.  As I am a Weight Watcher and in 3 years have gone from size 22 to size 12 their clothing has been tremendous. I do not like to spend my time shopping so going in, finding the size I need, and getting out suits me perfectly. In the mean time I have picked up a number of treasures along the way.</text>

<text>Very clean, awesome prices, well stocked Thrift Store. The clothes are sorted very carefully before they go out for sale. Very gently used,  no stains, good variety of sizes, lots of name brands. Good deal of houseware items as well as decorative and seasonal items. Lots of books. They have furniture sometimes a lot sometimes not much. The prices also vary with sales and the first three days of the month is half off. I wish I had known about this place sooner. If you have time stopping by a couple times a week is a good idea as items sell quickly. Definitely the best in the county.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809095d3fa1e3ad5:0xf2773273661460e3<//gmapID></record>

It isn't so much about what you find as it I 's what your dollars go to. If you have had someone who needed care at the most difficult in their lives or yours you know the money they take in is well spent. That's why I also donate regularly.< /Review>

Average thrift store. Donating is nearly impossible. Several times, I've gone during posted donation hours, or even called ahead, only to find it closed. Wasted a lot of time and gas.< /review>

Did not dine there. Went for outdoor music. Was a bit disappointed as venue advertised jazz and band was an odd mix . Definitely no jazz. Nice to get out and about during Pleasanton event that included many open restaurants and live music.</review>

<Review>A girlfriend and I stopped in here to get out of the sun and cool off with a quick drink.  Best decision ever!
Cierra was our server. Great service! Good drinks.
Excellent live music by Groovality!! You must check them out.  Best music I've heard in a long time.  Friendly crowd.
We will definitely be back.<//Review>< GmapID>

Do you like local bars that brew their own beer!? This is the place for you! Located at the entrance to downtown Pleasanton, they are the first establishment you will see arriving into town. Delicious bar food as well as full on dinner entrees are served and they all hit the spot. Enjoy live music  on Wednesday and Fridays (some Saturdays too, I believe in the warmer months). Plenty of regulars congregate here to eat, drink, and be merry now is the time to become one of them.< /Text>< gmap_id>

We tried a flight of the home brews but weren't super impressed ( they ran out of Illuminati). But the nachos were very delicious. No live music on Sundays so check with them before going.< /Text>

Been visiting this great place every time we go to Pleasanton. Our first visit was in July 2001 when we lived there.
Great food, great beer, great staff.
Good luck for the future and for sure... we will swing by in May 2021!<//review>

Great place to hang out in the beautiful downtown of Pleasanton. And they have free live music every Saturday night! Never had food there, so I can't say much about their menu. But the atmosphere is cool.< /review>

<review>Met friends for music recently. Between us our door charges, tabs and tips exceeded $150 over the evening.  We were appalled to be denied a glass of water at the end of the night and instead offered single use plastic water bottles for $2.00 a pop by Justin the bartender. We assume this is a policy of the Main Street Brewery.  Happy 25th Anniversary.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fe9a38b1e8ac9:0xc60d288b175852c2</Gmap_id></record>

Clean, efficient, beautifully done indoor and outdoor pub. Nice simple wine list. Friendly staff. Very fun spot in downtown Pleasanton. Awesome bands and very diverse age crowd. I saw an amazing jazz band and singer the night was I was there. Cute food, nice selection of beers and ale's. Its nice not to drive to the inner bay!< /review>

I worked here for a short period before moving out of city. The staff is great, but management is terrible. The customers constantly complain about how the workers are treated and how the building is run. During my time there, there was supposed to be a work schedule set up after the first couple days, instead I ended up being on call anytime they needed me there, but I'm a college student with an autoimmune disorder so I needed the paycheck. Instead of getting any paycheck (a couple months later now) they're miraculously never around when I call to ask about payment for my work. I'm currently working on taking it to court since I have record of my time spent there. I hear they have good food and the staff is great, I just wouldn't recommend working there.</text>

<Text>Love this place! You absolutely have to go see the bands that come to Main Street Brewery!! They have good food and service! This is a must vist, such a great part of historical Main street Pleasanton. The owner Matt has done such a great job growing this Brewery into an amazing brewery. I have been going here for at the very least 20 years, I no longer live in Pleasanton but every tine I pass through Pleasanton its definitely a stop made. I have often made 1 1/2 hour trip to see some great bands and fun dancing. I highly recommend Main Street Brewery!!!</Text></record>

Honestly, visiting on a Monday, this place felt more like a neighborhood bar, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Their own beers are fairly average, but the guest beer list had some very interesting beers.<//text>

<Text>I rolled in on a Saturday mid afternoon, so the place was super empty.  But I was able to get a beer, and some garlic fries in no time and for a fair price.  So I can't complain.  Outside seating was covered and had a good vibe.  Staff was friendly.<//Text>< Pictures>

I've been going to the brewery for a decade. So I guess I like the place, right? Yeah, I do. I mean they have root beer on tap (which totally just pushed my rating to five stars). Who doesn't think that is awesome? The food menu has a lot of options. Like, more than most restaurants. Burgers are good, sandwiches are damn fine, the salads are big and tasty. But man, those NACHOS, BRO! Those things are top tier buddy.
Moving along to the beer: Matt brews a dozen or more beers in house, somewhere between five and seven of which will be available on any given day. My favorites: Strawberry Blond (wheat), Dead Head Red (Red), Red Leaf (2xIPA), Trainwreck (IPA), Pirate Porter (brewed with rum). I could go on and on. They also have a bunch of guest taps that have various popular beers. Staff is, like, the best too.< /Review>

This is a great neighborhood bar and grill.  It's not sports bar, though you can catch a game every once in awhile. Live bands on Friday nights provide a fun environment for the 30+ crowd.

The staff and owners are friendly and attentive.

Food is good. Drinks are good,  but a little pricey. My favorite is the BBQ chicken Quesadilla.

Definitely a place worth checking out.</Text>

This place is great.  The pastrami sandwich is great.  One time I asked for the fish tacos to be fried and they not only accommodated the request, they made them perfectly.  The strawberry blonde in my favorite beverage while there and it is always consistently good.  Served ice cold by friendly staff.  We can't wait to have our Christmas party there this year.  You have got to try the Main St Brewery.< /review>

We go out often and this place is easily the WORST club/bar experience I've had - EVER! The attitude of the ownership and staff toward the clientele is disrespectful, condescending and generally just plain awful. Especially that of Matt, Max and Erin. I made a point of noting their names so that they would know specifically who I'm referring to. You're all in the WRONG business! Additionally, the condition of the facilities is substandard and WILL be reported. I strongly recommend NOT frequenting this establishment. I certainly won't again. I hope that the saying "you reap what you sew" is true and this place runs at a loss until it folds.<//text>

Charges you for expensive beers you didn't order.

When I arrived I was told that they have 2 dollar pints for this one particular type of beer. After I finished the beer, without asking, the server poured me another beer. After telling him that I wasn't sure if I wanted more, The bartender said that it was on the house. I kept drinking, and being a little buzzed, I kept ordering more beers.

The bill came and not only was i charged for that beer he said was on the house, I was charged 10 dollars per pint.

What a scam. The owner of the bar was there and I talked to him before I got the bill: this guy was sleazy like a used car salesman.

Avoid this place.<//Review>

<name>Brian Schwartz<//name><date>1434548083752</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Very disappointing. Went here to watch NBA finals with a colleague and was embarrassed for having chosen this place. Let's start with the TVs. Not having HDTV signal in this day and age is unforgivable and diminished the quality of watching the game. Service - Our server was very confused the entire evening. Delivered food to wrong tables and forgot drink orders. Drinks - One drink was poorly made (no big deal, it happens sometimes) but bartender refused to remake it when it was brought back by the server. No excuse for this poor attitude and behavior by the bartender who I was told is also the manager. Food - burgers were good. Appetizers were from the freezer to the fryer and cam to the table very greasy. Bottom line - I've lived in Pleasanton 15 years and been here dozens of times. After this visit, I doubt I would return.</Text>< pics>

Love the food and beers, service is usually solid. Occasionally we run into a shortage of indoor seating due to truly reserved tables (locked off a good 20-30min ahead of the reservation). I guess that's ok if it's your reservation, but it hurts the experience for walk-ins. Outdoor seating is fun, though super hot in the earlier summer evenings, and the sun glares pretty hard at you until it disappears below the facade of the old Pleasanton Hotel building across the street.<//review>

Food is great, nice environment.... But the beer they make is horrible. I have to agree, and I'm not picky. I tried 3 and they all tasted grainy as if a powder flavor or something was added...sad

I still plan on going back, just not for the beer<//Review>

Not sure how that happened but it happened the two times we went there and we are never going back. It wasn't really our crowd anyway as everyone was well over 40 and divorced and prowling. Their live bands were extremely loud as well to where you can't hear a word anyone says and it gets crowded.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>This place deserves ZERO stars! Used to be our favorite hang out. We went in Saturday night 12-2-17 and yes it was busy but the bartender was an a**hole to my husband, literally snatched the credit card out of his hand and at the end of the night our card somehow got "lost"! Next day we had major charges on it😠 Needless to say, we're NEVER going back!</Review><gmapID>0x808fe9a38b1e8ac9:0xc60d288b175852c2<//gmapID><time>1512515286568<//time><UserId.>104220561732161766932<//UserId.><Name>Yvette DeSisto</Name></record>

Fantastic beer selection. All brewed on site, and all are fantastic. Try the Nitros, not to be missed. Food is solid and has a decent selection. The grande nachos will leave you filled and satisfies (be sure to request extra Jalapeño and Tapatio).<//Review>

<date>1352837892333</date><Text>Went to see the "Groove Doctors" Saturday, Nov .IIth . It was SO CROWDED, there was no standing room. If you went to dance, someone stepped on your toes, or you got an elbow in the back of head. The service was soooo slow I had to wait a long time for whipped creme for my Irish coffee. I was told at first, they did not have whipped creme. I was then given some hours later, when I saw another patron have some.

The line to the bathroom was twenty mins! The bouncer kept letting people in, when there was no room, to even stand. Not worth it!  I would not recommend.<//Text>< rate>

Great local hangout with a very good selection of beers and live music on weekends.
Downgraded one star for hit and miss food quality, charging full price for ice tea refills and for high turnover of waitstaff.
We've been here several times over the past few months and have had several waitresses tell us it's their first day or week.
The food has been hit and miss, whether ordering the same item or something different there is no consistency to the quality. The first time I had the garlic mushroom burger it was awesome! Cooked just right and flavorful.  I ordered it again on my most recent visit and it was cooked to death! It was flavorless and tough to chew.
A while back the band was pretty good so we stayed for the band's entire show. We had two appetizers, two dinners with ice tea to drink and I had two glasses of beer. Neither one of us drinks alcohol much for health reasons. Throughout the night we both had refills of ice tea.  When the bill came I was surprised to see that we were being charged full price for every ice tea refill.  This charge took a what should have been a reasonable bill for dinner into the realm of absurdly expensive.
I paid the bill and noted on the receipt my dissatisfaction at the outrageous charge for ice tea refills. We frequently dine out and very few restaurants charge for ice tea refills.  Those that do usually print this fact on the menu or the waitperson informs patrons that refills are charged for, typically at a nominal price much less than the full price, usually less than half price.
We still like the Main Street Brewery  and will continue to patronize the business in the hope that management reads this review and makes the appropriate adjustments.< /Text>

<Time>1594474463001<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Overall decent quality food, and the menu has most of the standard offerings you would expect from a sushi restaurant. I did find a sharp bone in one piece of my sashimi, and it took us about 10 minutes to get the check once we wanted to pay (we were there during the lunch rush).

I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this place. everytime  I feel like having a good supper, this is the place that comes immediately to my head. fresh and all sorts of  food and a rich cuisine.courteous team, and good spirit. Also, the bill is good. I recommend this restaurant with pleasure.

Service was fast and friendly but the price is bit high but you're paying for what you get so it's worth the money. But long  patient line for such small place testifies that this place is popular.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwlYD9Uxnf3YxJZbxvV3AuSztSGuWpirLE-zQc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ1yyd5dj7SQ885fKspaxHctmGeUfz55X4YjCS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMioKbmaXYozUKdsS_nMcHvYDbJ7zEq-8J7tgIX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIuL70f0fWhoK9kyVamHQ87uAyPgBz5joP495l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1I7PEXt1hyRaEWuo3tn9VEvcnUlc-4gPpTAem=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNU_PquCDe9EeTAL-MVF3GWyG1yBNRmhkUuf-Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f79af2a61f9e5:0x82531af4d4d2cbd1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>This has a been a great neighborhood Sushi spot for great Omakase at a reasonable cost. These photos are from a few years ago when we had a group dinner. We got to try the full variety of items on their menu. Plus a few special items that we ordered.

Cant wait to go back when things get back to normal. For now it’s just take out and it’s still delicious.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>John Chan<//Name><gmap_id>0x808f79af2a61f9e5:0x82531af4d4d2cbd1</gmap_id>< resp>

<review>More of what expect from Amami Sushi, but in a newer building and with shorter waits. The quality of the fish is an incredible value. You get large cuts of expertly crafted nigiri. Service is decently fast, but it's small so they can't not notice you. Non-raw dishes are tasty, too. Inside is clean with a sushi bar if you plan on dining alone. Specials are posted on the wall, visible from every table</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkEuTjTfx3Awf_egGdgnfh253TGoaV8eYF7GFb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU0DataCV_AzQz6ylk0FfZFelcS6MjkM7Rjsgu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Prob my fave sushi place in DTLA.  Menu is simple, fish is always fresh and service is consistently excellent.  Grab a pencil and menu, grab a seat and wait for your fresh rolls.  Tax is included on the bill.  My fave are the yellowtail and scallops!

Parking lot across the street is $3 for every 15 minutes and $10 max, plenty of meters on the street if you can get lucky and the lot right next to it is $5 for first 1.5 hours.  Located on the left of a one way street (MAIN).</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808f79af2a61f9e5:0x82531af4d4d2cbd1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great little spot in South San Francisco only 5 minutes from the airport. Try the 10-piece omakase for $38: great value you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.
Complimentary soup and green tea, the servings are generous and the service is efficient.<//Text>< Pics>

Incredibly fresh fish. Omakase at $33 is unbelievable. Small selection of sakes but very reasonable pricing <20 for a btl. Very friendly and helpful staff if you can get their attention, particularly noticeable if the place is busy. Takes reservations and 2 cards max.</Review>

<Review>The fish is fresh and delicious at this place. The slices are pretty generous. I love the omakase here. It's very reasonably priced at $36! It's 1/3 of the price of any fancy Japanese restaurant you'll find in the city. I've found the fish quality to be better here than at most upscale places in SF. I usually order the omakase and the seared toro with uni. I would definitely recommend the omakase for first time visitors! It's a great way to find your favorite cuts for your next visit. 😉<//Review><gmap_id>0x808f79af2a61f9e5:0x82531af4d4d2cbd1< /gmap_id></record>

Overall the food was good and everyone we saw came here for the sushi. Considering South SF is kinda limited in sure it works but the service killed the experience. The seating was slow and we had to sit at the bar (they prioritize reservations, obviously), they forgot about our beer, and the entree’s took way too long. I think she forgot about it again. Not too hyped but the food is good so it’s worth it if the service runs smoothly.< /Text></record>

Went here to visit a friend in town. Reviews don't lie. They took our reservation and set it up so they sat their tables at the same time which really helped make things fair. It took a minute to be seated but the speed of service after compensated for the 15min wait. They even asked us to move to accommodate more guests and in the end made it worth our while. Very happy with quality and service.<//review>

Ordered the "lover's boat" - a good deal for two people. "Fish stuff" was of a good quality and delicious. But it is a pretty busy place and looks like they do not have enough waiters. We had to ask three times to bring us water. Also when they brought ice cream for dessert it was all melted.</text>

<review>Ordered the omakase... only $36 but it packed a punch. I live in NY and an omakase of this portion would have definitely been upwards of $80.

Fish slices on top of the nigiri were generously sized. You should be able to see from the pictures that these fish chunks are huge. I loved the idea of having a fish head miso soup. Strongly suggest trying that out.

Service was just okay; I had to ask them to go over what each nigiri was for the omakase. I would have expected this to be done always for omakase. Still, give this a 5* cause all I care about is the food!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSkqUVzITPlmK3fscYuZBNa6xETfJl2kK69AvT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX9MPanWJWGqIl3VQ_FMn8NOBLUvjEwCRQT8eC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Overall decent quality food, and the menu has most of the standard offerings you would expect from a sushi restaurant. I did find a sharp bone in one piece of my sashimi, and it took us about 10 minutes to get the check once we wanted to pay (we were there during the lunch rush).<//text>

This is a nice little sushi spot tucked into a South San Francisco neighborhood amongst many others. The sushi is good the service is great and the green tea they serve reminded me of being in Japan. It’s a nice place to stop in for lunch.< /review>

<text>One of the better sushi spots in SSF. Great staff- friendly & attentive. Variety on menu. I usually get the Chirashi & special rolls. Recently, i tried their Omakase & it was fantastic! Highly recommended. This location is often busy so expect a wait time. Make reservations esp if you plan on dining with a group.<//text><time>1533940789381< /time>< resp>

What's not to love about good sashimi? I ordered the sashimi regular at lunch, and it was very filling. The waitresses were friendly and the food came out fast. We got there before the noon hour rush, or else we would have waited a while for a table and even longer for our food.</Text>

<text>Their sashimi is the best. A little pricy, but worth the price. Big chunk of fish and a little rice at the bottom. Just order the special that's written on the broad. Service is excellent, very attentive. And there is always a wait like twenty to thirty minutes.< /text><Date>1565447651217<//Date>< name>

Hot Tea is Standard after seating and entree ordered.  Amami has bento box combinations and many specialties. Watch out for wasabi, a green spicy hot horseradish. Nigiri is a pair of bite size rice balls topped with your favorite raw or cooked seafood. Maki is a roll of rice and various ingredients wrapped in Nori seaweed. Handrolls are cone shaped rice plus seafood and taste great.<//Text>< pictures>

I used to work in Tokyo and Osaka.  I've not had sushi this good since I worked there.  The tea is really good as well.  The fresh wasabi, portion size and seasonal specials really set this place apart.  The waitresses are very helpful and take their time to discuss the selections and make recommendations.  The place can get packed but once you get a seat, enjoy the experience.</Text>

Wow...just awesome. The sashimi melted in our mouths and rolls were delicious and spot on. The place was jammed yet they cranked out the food and we were in and out in just over an hour.< /text>

<text>Went two nights in a row and couldn’t get a seat for one person on a Tuesday and Wednesday. Both nights there were three empty seats at the bar, and both nights the server/hostess wouldn’t let me sit there. So I stood at the entry for 20 min as three other couples who came in after me and signed in after me were seated at two tops. The food may be very good, but I left after 20 min of waiting both nights.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>G. S.</Name><UserId.>109128702990480066504< /UserId.><Text>We frequent this place. Our last visit was a BIG disappointment. Among many other items ordered, we had Vegetable Tempura and our usual Vegetable Fried Rice (off menu). Firstly, they forgot our Miso Soup and Salad, then our Vegetable Tempura had four giant Broccoli and very little of any other assorted veggies. When we normally order this, we usually get a variety...must be an off night for the kitchen. Lastly, our Vegetable Fried Rice was $20! In the past our charge was much less...how can a simple vegetable Fried Rice cost $20 while the Kobe Beef Fried Rice or Uni /Scallop Fried Rice be $30...or a meager difference of $10 only? And of course, our bill was wrong because they charged us for items we did not consume. I believe Chef/Owner Alan should look into this branch operations more closely...I sense a creeping decline...🥴<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>A little gem in South San Francisco!!! Good sushi and consistently good food quality.  They are very busy in the evening, but you can call ahead to get on a waiting list which is very helpful!  Service is okay.  The space is small, but I never feel like it is too loud to have a conversation or enjoy your meal.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Get the toro. You don't be disappointed. The uni is also fresh and sweet.

Well priced, great tasting sushi for downtown SF. The entrees are a little pricier, but definitely not outrageous or out of the budget for someone going to a sushi place.

The service was also pretty good! The waitress greeted us almost immediately and made sure we constantly had a mug full of tea. She wasn't as great about refilling the waters (it was a SUPER hot day, we weren't so much about the hot tea...) but other than that not bad!

Parking was also fairly easy to find, but it might've just been because of what time we went (early dinner on a weekday) so don't take that advice to heart too much!

Overall well-priced food in a good location.</review>

The omakase 👌 very good bc the fish quality was amazing!!! Try the Norwegian salmon if you get the chance! That was by far my favorite . The sushi man is super friendly ! 😄 My only issue was that the restaurant was that it is kind of packed and the wait for the food was a bit long, but the fish quality was super worth it.< /Text>

As soon as we walked in we were seated and our orders were taken. Within a minute our sashimi and california rolls had come, and just a few minutes later we had our whole meal in front of us. The sushi was high quality and the menu had a lot of variety. I will definitely come again.</review><date>1535849074082</date>< name>

Somehow they source sushi grade fish that is so delicate and tender. It's unlike any fish I have had at any other sushi restaurant on the Peninsula. I've not tried some of the high end sushi in the city, but I understand that their sushi grade fish doesn't have a noticeable difference from the quality of Amami. I recommend the Chirachi bowl or a sashimi platter.

Only issue is that this place is always slow. The servers work incredibly hard, and I have never had them mess up an order which is impressive. They need more staff for the lunch rush. You can't have a full restaurant with a line out the door and expect two servers to both wait and bus.<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>Sushi was very fresh. Ordered the Chef special and I couldn't finish it, probably because I was eating other appetizers as well. This one is a little smaller, so expect a long wait if you did not make reservations. The o my thing I didn't like was the baby clam special as it kept a fishy aftertaste co later with other sushis. But then again I don't eat one one much so maybe that's normal. 🤣< /Text>< pictures>

This is my go to sushi place from now on.

As expected, a sushi place with this high of a rating is always full, what's great about it though is their service is constant and their food is always good. It seems that however rushed they are their food always seem to be great. I personally always go here with 1 or 2 friends and not much more since the place is a bit cozy and having a big group doesn't really seem to be recommended. Whenever I go we usually get either the Omakase or the Lover's boat since both are great for 2 people. Although of its your first time, I'd suggest getting the omakase for solo, all of the dishes that the chef serves is amazing!

Lastly if you live near this place or have a safe way to get home, their sake choices are great and itsi a great way to slow down the fast day that you've been through.

Overall great place and probably the only restaurant that I've given a full 5 stars to, and rightfully so.</Review>

Love this restaurant. They have some of the best sashimi in the Bay Area and is reasonably priced. My wife and I went here for lunch on Valentine's Day and the placed was packed. Luckily, a few tables were finished and ready to leave. We end waiting for less then thirty minutes. We ordered baby o toro, hamachi toro, sake tore, uni and Hokkaido scallops. If you love fatty fish, definitely try the baby o toro and the hamachi toro. Both are fresh and succulent with a taste of umami. We have the hamachi toro lightly seared, which give a more complex taste.</Review>

Here's the issue I had with Amami. While the food was good the service was pretty bad. I arrived there and ordered at 11: 50 and it took 45 to 50 minutes to get my food. It also wasn't anything special. It was just sashimi on the lunch menu! My friend who ordered the katsu plate got it pretty much immediately and I had to wait quite a bit longer without food in front of me. Not sure how a cooked chicken plate was able to come out of the kitchen sooner than a raw fish plate. I will go back but next time I will be sure to order something little easier for them to get out.</Review>

I ordered a lunch special with tonkatsu and tempura.  All the food was delicious. The miso soup came with lots of tofu.  The waitresses were very attentive and polite. They fill your tea up constantly.  They just keep racking points up. I couldn't find anything negative to say about this place.<//Review>

Not the best sushi I've had for sure. But the staff was nice.

Update: sushi rolls are underwhelming, and kind of a rip off. But the sashimi is where it’s at!! Super good!<//text>

Plan smart! I always come during a weekday right when they open. Otherwise you'll be waiting for a while outside. They also are terrible at keeping reservations.

The omakase is a great price and great portions!! It's not traditional omakase but I prefer this casual laid back style more. I just wanna eat fish and not be bothered.

Service is meh. I'm just here for the fish quality and price.</text>

Short story: Good sushi. HORRENDIOUS service. Will NOT be back.

Long story: Searched Google for a good sushi restaurant while in town. Found Amami San accessible, reasonably priced and great reviews. My fiancé and I arrived a little before 7pm and it was packed - a good sign for good sushi, which we were craving and in no particular rush so, we waited patiently close to 20 minutes before it was blatantly obvious the hostess/waitress was ignoring us and another party of four - I'm assuming in hopes that we would tire of waiting and move along to another place. But, as I said before we were in no rush and the packed house solidified this was the place to be for good sushi. The group of four was seated and we watched as 2, 3, then 4 tables became available and still no acknowledgement from the h/w. A woman, a couple, and a trio walk in and within 30 seconds the h/w walks up and addresses the couple first (seriously?!), before finally getting us on the list and sitting us a few minutes later. Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, we sit down at the sushi bar excited to get some food. The trio is sat beside us almost immediately. We decide on some misos to start and 4 rolls to share. Waitress comes back in 5 minutes or so and we place our order and get our misos relatively quickly. The satisfaction of warm tasty miso quickly evaporates as 10.... 20 minutes go by and the trio next to us starts getting food but no sign of our rolls. 30... 40 minutes have passed and more food gets passed over us at the bar to the waitresses running it out to tables AND more annoyingly to the trio beside us. Sushi chef behind the bar asks if we had ordered as he hands another plate of food to another couple beside us. Yes. Yes we have. (Add insult to injury as my stomach is eating itself) 50... 60 minutes has now gone by and I am one platter away from leaving a $10 on the table and walking out the door. Thankfully next plate up is two of our rolls. We devour them, wait another 10 minutes for our last two rolls and inhale them in 30 seconds. Card out, we try (and fail) to get our waitresses' attention to grab the check. My much nicer and more patient fiancé finally gets her attention and she brings the check but walks off before he can open the black book to put his card into (which he already had out and in his hand). 5 minutes later, we finally stand up to hand them our bill so we can leave. Our waitress comes and grabs our check as we are noticeably standing in the front of this small establishment, but a different waitress brings our check back and rudely drops it (with an audible 'smack') on the counter in front of us without a word. Relieved to leave after taking over 2 hours, we will never be back because of the lack of communication and outright disrespectful service.<//text>

<text>Wonderful meal! The food was all prepared very nicely and was delicious. They offer kobe beef and fatty tuna, both of which we got; the waiter was very helpful in warning us that both were small portions of 2 pieces each when we ordered them, which we appreciated a lot. We also got the Romeo and Juliet sushi roll, sashimi, udon, tempura, and sesame ice cream, all of which were great. Service was quick. Thanks for the meal!<//text><gmapID>0x808f79af2a61f9e5:0x82531af4d4d2cbd1< /gmapID><UserId.>117750042826931398790< /UserId.>< Date>

Mediocre sushi restaurant at best. Ordered a decent amount of specials/rolls/nigiri. Was not impressed with any of the dishes served. Also, the rice was falling apart from the rolls and nigiri. Will not be coming back.<//Text>

This restaurant is actually just for the most part, an average place. Average service, and average food. Everything is just average, apart from the "Omakase."

This single dish makes stopping at this restaurant worth it. For the uninitiated, or for those who don't really go for sushi, "Omakase" or "おまかせ", is roughly translated as "Depend on you," but in a restaurant, it means that you're letting the chef choose. And that's exactly what they do, and they do it well.

This also means that I can't tell you what pieces you'll get, as it changes with time. Admittedly, this dish is pricey, but every now and then, it's worth it.

Also, it should be noted that the last time I was here, a friend of mine waited more than 30 minutes for 2 orders of tuna nigiri, with confirmation of the dish twice.

Understandably he ended up cancelling it in the end because it never came. Even though they were busy, it's funny that they couldn't get a few pieces to him within that time frame. He should have gone with an Omakase.< /text>

Favorite sushi place in the area. Their spice salmon and Norwegian salmon are particular highlights. Try to make reservations because this place gets packed on weekends.< /Review>

Nice dining room for fairly priced lunch combos.  Service was quite prompt.  Disappointed that my teriyaki chicken and tempura combo had cold chicken; I guess it was waiting on the plate while the tempura finished frying to be served together.  And the chicken karaage appetizer was bland.  Other places usually do it with some garlic or ginger flavor.  Nice that the miso soup had sliced mushrooms.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The sushi is very fresh, the entrance is instant, the ingredients are very high-grade, the rice is soft and moderate, and it is a Japanese restaurant that people often want to come to!

壽司🍣非常新鮮，入口即化，用的食材都非常高級，米飯軟硬適中，是一家會讓人常常想來的日本料理店！</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's a little expensive. The store is so noisy that you can't hear the other person. You shouldn't think about Korea or Japan.

<Text>Always down to earth and helpful. Mike is a very competent owner who never sells you things you don't need. The price is always reasonable, affordable and fair. I will be a customer for life. They do all sorts of car repair, maintenance and as a bonus they do all things smog related. P.S. Justin is so helpful and help makes the process virtually painless. Thanks guys< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>this is a really good automotive repair shop. Nice people that care about doing good work at a fair price. I've had them do smog checks and AC work and I have friends that have had them do diagnostics and all sorts of repairs. They're good guys and I would recommend them to anyone.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Winter Gardens Auto, it's not often that you hear the words ((Honest Mechanic)) in the same sentence!!!. I'm telling you that's exactly what they are. They're honest, good-hearted, hard-working, pillars, of the community. I'm not sure exactly how many years they've been in business, they have been here the entire time I've lived here. Winter Gardens Auto was very highly recommended to me, I am passing that high recommendation on to whomever is reading this. I guarantee you Justin and Mike are honest and if they can help you they will. What I mean by that is some things just have to go back to the dealership and that's life but they'll tell you they're not going to take your money and not fix it for you if it needs to go to the dealer and they'll tell you it needs to go to the dealer.<//text>

<Text>Walked in needing a smog, they had just gone on their lunch break, but the tech said to bring it on in, and they got it done right then for me. Friendly and professional. Definitely going back for any shop work my Prius may need.<//Text><time>1584739115602</time><UserId.>115247462266497020906<//UserId.>< name>

9/18 called and spoke to Mike got price and found out if they could do smog.. Called back and  made appt but mike said had to be following week cause he said sometimes machine he needs for older cars doesnt always
work so appt for 10am Tues 9/24...took car in this morning and he REFUSED to
work on it said he doesnt work on older  cars.. Explained  he knew it was a 1999
when appt was made..finally said he only smogs previous  customers cars. Had I known that I wouldn't  have wasted my time. Also he took another customer that arrived after us first saying they were in a hurry (the guy said he wasnt) even though we had an appointment! Plus after still refusing to smog car told us we could go down the street to a different smog
station. Called BAR when got home and was told a star station shouldn't   pick and choose what cars he works on. I'm new to the area looking for a shop and now you couldnt pay me to take my car there!!!  BEWARE!<//Text>

<text>Soooo I went to take my jeep in for major oil leak in front of engine block, $740 later it needed new seal at front of engine block. Drive away and 2 days later I'm having the same problem. Take it back to them and they say there's too much play in the crank so you need a new engine block... $3600. I say ok, can you refund some of the $740 since you basically didn't do your job as a mechanic. He said nope! Ridiculous, go to a mechanic who knows what he's doing.<//text>< pics>

The girls here are amazing. The quality of work they do is great. It does get crowded so I strongly suggest making an appt.  Kayla can do any design you want just bring a picture and she can do it.  Liv6e this place!</Text>

<Text>OMG WOW!!!! The shop looks amazing after they remodeled!!!! I’ve been coming here for years and it always felt to cramped and old school, now it just feels so open and clean. Very impressed with the renovation... Also it’s so much easier getting in and out of chairs without all the tables packed right there since im a bigger girl, love their long table set up by the way! Now that the salon is much cleaner and bigger feelings, i can’t wait to be back and take my whole family with me!!<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating><GmapID>0x80c2d494369f15ef:0x1637c6ef0f8da0eb</GmapID><username>erin jacobson< /username>< response>

I disliked this place because  Lam who helped me seem disinterested in assisting me and did a horrible job. You would have thought she was a newbie because she gave me a huge cut in my right toe and didn't even apologize for it. Lady who did my hands did a great job that's why I rated 2 stars if not I would have rated zero stars. I normally go to K&C Nails is Paramount CA way better and much cheaper.< /review>

I never had to post a review before because usually I am very easily pleased. However,  this was too much to ignore. This place does not do a very good job with  pedicures. I had to ask if they could trim the calais from around my nails😤 Isn't that part of the reason why I am there?? Also the colors did not match my toes and fingers😖 I hope if you try this place that you will have a better experience than I did. Good luck😊<//Review>

Outstanding experience. The salon is very clean, and the staff are very friendly. The pedicure bowls are cleaned and scoured after every use even though they use a plastic liner for every new customer. I recommend this place very highly<//Text>

Got my dad a gift card for a pedicure. Him and my mother switched from there last place to here and said it was amazing as far as confort. Hard to get service as usual at these type of places but when I asked for a gift card it was fast and friendly</Review>

they schedule to many people that they rush through and so the quality of service is cheap for what they charge, then they add items without asking so they can charge you more, not worth my money< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>If I could rate this place with not even one star, I would definitely be doing that in this review! I went to this nail salon for the first time expecting decent service, given that It had decent reviews. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Long story short I took my daughter on her birthday to get a manicure.  The lady that was assigned to her did not know how to do french tip. The lady started the job and when she realize that she couldn't finish the job she removed the nail polish and started all over. As she was working on my daughter nails I could see her roughness and frustration. She kept pulling my daughters hands. When she finally realize that she couldn't do the french tip she got so frustrated that she got up and left. A few employees gathered up to figure out what the issue was. I didnt know what was going on since they were speaking their language. A few minutes went by and another lady came in and took over to finish my daughters nails. Sadly to say I was taking my daughter in for her 10th birthday. She had such an awful experience that it's infortunate to say it ruin her morning.
I spoke to the girl that was in charge, I believe she's the daughter of the owners. I expressed to her how unsatisfied I was in a respectful manner and she acted very defensive and careless. She replied back saying that the reason why I felt this way was because her employees talked loud and that most people think they are being rude because they are loud. I surely was not referring to how loud her employees were. It was that fact of how my daughter was treated and the awful experience she had. All I wanted to accomplish in this conversation was for her to speak with her employee. This way someone else doesn't have to go through what I went through. I warn her that I would be posting this review but evidently she did not care.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

The people who work there could be a little nicer. They don't even say good morning when you come into the store they look the other way or down at your shoes. They need to learn public relations.</Text>

<Text>I like to go here in the evenings when there are no crowds. The store is well lit and very clean. It is unbelievable how well stocked they are. Unlike a lot of stores in the area, this one carries family sized meat packages. Instead of having to buy 2 packages of 2 steaks you can buy one package of 5 steaks. It's just more economical. Plus the meat is of very good quality.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Lots of great coupons on app and very clean store. The $5 chicken special is the best. Inside Albertsons is a Starbucks, great addition! One of my favorite places to shop.</Text>

<Review>One of the worst Albertsons in Santa Maria. Its obvious that management is USELESS! They have signs everywhere telling people that its required to wear a mask inside the market But there are people who don't care, walk around with no masks and no social distancing and the management allows it. So, then why tell people that masks are required???  I wanted to talk to management about it and the manager laughed at both my mom and myself and told us that If we didn't feel safe in her market to go somewhere else.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Good selections,  very clean store. AND they sell a selection of Linn's Cambria jams & syrups.  Sadly though,  they've discontinued selling Linn's delicious pies.  I don't live close enough now 2 make too many trips 2 Cambria 2 buy their pies.< /Text>

Very convenient on the south side of Santa Maria. Really big store with lots of options. Actually a Safeway or Vons store so prices are the same.
Has US Bank inside, drop-off cleaners, really large & nice floral dept., as well as nice bakery & deli dept.
Great supply of adult beverages. The meat & seafood counters are well stocked & like the variety of fresh fruits.
The lines were extremely long for checkout but nowadays this seemed normal.<//Text>

<user_name>Lynette Wyller< /user_name><Text>Glittering groceries! I feel so comfortable going to my Albertson's grocery store . I like the way it is set up: there is a beautiful display of flowers across from the Starbucks concession to the right; customer service, clean restroom and pharmacy to the left. They have a deli and bakery with super helpful employees.  (My family loves their cakes and I love their chicken and potato salad!
Everything is so organized and convenient. On the pharmacy side you can find just about every over- the -counter personal item,  and I have found last minute gifts in that part of the store.
It is a great store and a great location - off McCoy and Broadway in the Arby's shopping Center. It is easy to reach from any part of the city.< /Text><GmapID>0x80ec146341bbf3b1:0x78af3b2682089309</GmapID>< userid>

<text>If they would either reopen or re-label the food court, I'd break out with 5 stars. It's a straight tease, seeing the sign never fails to cause a craving for Chinese food!
Otherwise, the store is terrific and has lots of ways to assist with my disabilities.
Kind staff too, as well as awesome deli sammiches :-)</text>< GmapID>

<review>The store has better quality meat and produce, but all items are significantly more expensive than competitors.

The store used to have the best customer service, but as of the last year the service has deteriorated to the point that it is on par with Walmart and not worth the exorbitant prices.

Now they’ve removed self checkout and you are forced to deal with the bad service.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><rating>2</rating>< GmapID>

I was double charged to my debit card. For the same order. Just for you program is a lie to steal your money. When i complained about the poor result of my visit. I was referred to corporate. I explained to corporate i did not have a reciept but my bank statement had 2 charges for the same amount at the same time. They said .."they could not discuss legal matters. And hung up.. Do not use debit/credit at this store due to corporate embezzlement. Im am getting a lawyer over $100 overdraft from corruption.< /Text>

<Review>Ordered Turkey for Thanksgiving which was supposed to be cooked with several side dishes. When we picked it up, it was frozen along with the sides. I asked the girl if this was the norm. She told me, "oh yes, its fully cooked you just need to take it home and reheat it for 90 minutes". Now the whole point was to not have to cook thr meal. Reheating for 90 minutes is almost thr same. The Turkey was horrible. The mash potatoes way too watery. I strongly suggest not ordering for the holidays from albertsons. Extremely disappointed.</Review>< pictures>

The meat prices are outrageous! $16 for a very small whole chicken. So are the vegetables. At least it is somewhat clean, as opposed to many grocery stores in this area.< /Text>

This evening we went to buy a huge sandwich that your service deli will make to our order, just want to say thank you to Aaron, the young lady in the deli dept, she was patient and very helpful throughout our whole order, she truly provided us with legendary customer service, she is definitely an asset to Albertsons, we hope this message gets to her. Thank you very much Aaron.

Only store in Santa Maria where I can purchase ALL my favorite Non Dairy products: Tofutti sour cream, Follow Your Heart parmesan & gouda cheeses, Forager yogurt, soy milk & creamers. Took me many visits to other stores with one or two items only (I am new to the area). Why dont they advertise that they carry so many non_dairy items?</Text>

<review>I love the whole vibe of this store. Staff is always kind and helpful, plenty of sections and mini-stores to choose from, pretty good deals, but fairly steep regular prices. You pay for the environment though I guess but it can also get packed. Also, beware of the transient population nearby, as I got my bike stolen in front of there recently. Nothing against the store though.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>This is the grocery store we most frequent. They do a pretty good job most of the time. My one challenge is the products they carry. They frequently are out of some items or take a popular item and dis-continue carrying it. They do have signs that tell you they can order other products, however, if you are shopping for something, chances are you want it now. My one kudo goes to the meat counter staff, they do a great job! They are also the same people who will tell you they are out of something, and then tell you they are not sure why...< /text><user>117388496796943211623<//user><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Prices much to high. Clean place but really, I can shop for much lower prices nearby. Pharmacy is rude, gives incorrect info on your prescriptions and takes forever to approve your insurance.<//Review>

I actually MUCH prefer this location in Santa Maria as opposed the Albertsons in Orcutt and don't mind going OUT of my way a bit to visit this specific store. Each department is ALWAYS looking great & is FULLY stocked. Plus never hesitate to ask an associate to look in back for a product u dont SEE. They are eager to help- making sure to order your request that they're lacking OR things out of stock, anything (that they carry..not ANY thing).
Bravo 👏 👏 Thanks Albertsons 🌠🌈< /text>< Pics>

It's  a nice store. Many selections although they quit carrying several things I used to purchase,  customer service in deli could improve  they seem more concerned about their personal conversations than they are in serving their customers.  Also had to listen to people in bakery yelling to each other across the area which is unprofessional .<//Text>

<Review>This was the worst experience I have had at a grocery store in a long time. Went to get a sale item in the meat Dept. There was none in the freezer and when I asked the guy behind the counter he acted like I was putting him out to get more. When he returned, I said thank you and he totally ignored me. The checker was basically the same. Already turning to talk to the next customer when I was wishing him a nice day...after asking twice in one minute whether I wanted to buy a bag.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

It's a very big and spacious building, which makes its feel far less cramped than many other stores. Now that you can get a discount for fuel by shopping here, it's even better.<//text>

<review>The customer service is really horrible. I'm not sure why some people here. Can't multi tasking and ignore other customers but omg what a horrible experience. I would rather go to the Albertsons in orcutt. I shop at foodmax. The customer service there is amazing and they actually talk to you even if your in line behind the person they are taking care of. They make a point to include anyone who wants to be part of the conversation. Unlike Albertsons whose staff are a completely rude.

I love Albertson's the produce is the best quality and there is alot of light in this store. sometimes I find that grocery stores are dark and hard to see things from a distance. Albertson's is quite welcoming and offers samples in the bakery</text>
