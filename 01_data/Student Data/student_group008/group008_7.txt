The quality and price will beat any breakfast chain restaurant out there and even the smaller ones don't come close. There is lots of room here so you can have parties as well. The staff is wonderful and remember many of the customers that come in. The price for what you get is great along with the large amount you get as well!

There is only one down side is the restrooms.</Review>< rate>

<Text>I ended up trying the Greek omelette with the house potatoes it actually was pretty good. The Greek omelette had feta cheese and onions and beef and tomatoes. You also have a few different options that come with omelettes, such as pancakes, toast, grits or biscuits and gravy. The only downside I had with the food was that I had a piece of eggshells in it. Other then that the place was nice and they have friendly staff.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfzBRCA-90YLScwEZtG5cmBCeeUsQDqqYLvTpM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d94e07f881ab7b:0x432178020cd685d8< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Horrible management. The omelet was not even an omelet. The more I tried to eat the steak the more RAW it was towards the middle. So much butter on the toast and the manager doesn't even TRY to do something about this. He takes back my steak and COOKS it. That's SO unsafe for others!< /review>

Great food, great traditional "Americana" breakfast fare. Solid, prompt service, with eggs cooked perfectly to order. I'm especially partial to the eggs and pastrami combo, which I usually take with hash browns and sourdough toast. The quality of the pastrami was superior, and as mentioned, the eggs cooked perfectly to order.

One can linger or be in and out as slow or quickly as needed. Great place!< /Review>

<review>Great taste, decent prices, good portions. And they do it all here! Traditional American and Mexican breakfast which ACTUALLY tastes authentic! Very spacious so even when it's busy it doesn't feel super crowded. Our server was very quick and efficient but still very friendly and personable. I appreciate the bilingual staff. Great first time experience!< /review>< user_name>

Oh wow.  Restaurant surprised me with the large variety of menu items.
Restaurant is large and my son and I  didn't have to wait to be seated.
Waitress was most friendly and courteous.
Parking is on the main street of downtown Chula Vista & we got a parking space in front of the restaurant.
Breakfast was delicious!
Next time we are in Chula Vista, we are going back.  A wonderful meal experience.< /text>

The food was pretty good, decent sized portions. However, their credit card machine was having issues & they kept me their for 45 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with it. The management of the establishment seemed clueless, even asking me if I knew what any of the error messages on the machine meant. It is not up to me to figure out your credit card machines. You should make it a point to educate yourself on these machines if you’re going to use them. They made me very late for my appointment today because of this and it caused a great deal of trouble and inconvenience. Not very good customer service if you ask me.<//Review>

Came here today little after 9am. They were not very busy. We had our 19 month year old with us so we needed a highchair.
We were sat promptly at a table with only 1 chair. I had to go get a second chair. When we got the highchair we had to ask for a child's menu. The server took our order then I told her we needed drinks. We get coffee, no creamer offered. We get our food, no napkins, 1 set of silverware. I ordered my son's eggs over medium hard, they were over easy, I ordered crispy hashbrowns they were not fully cooked. My husband's waffles served with no butter. We were never checked on or asked how everything was. I needed napkins, refills on coffee and  pop, butter, silverware, water, creamer. I had to look creepy by going and picking up creamer and silverware from another table. Did I mention we had a kid? Well, the highchair strap was broken, while eating we took turns holding him in his chair. I finally flagged someone down for coffee and the woman poured a hot coffee OVER my 19 month-old son's head, I pulled him away. Our table was completely overrun with clutter and needed to have our pre- bussed so either of us could have room to eat after feeding or son. Really wanted to have a nice breakfast out of our house so Mama could enjoy her own breakfast. This was a great disappointment.< /text>

The food always has a home touch to them.  The food always tastes great,  and the atmosphere is always cozy. The food served quickly, hot and ready to eat. Most of the time you don't need to add seasoning to your dish.

Please forgive me as I was in a bit of a rush that I ate my food without taking a photo.  I will take another trip there and write a full review complete with photos.
Thank you for reading my review.<//text>

<Review>We landed here after looking for a breakfast spot close to Fredericka Manor, where we could take my folks.  We came during a lull, and were seated right away at a nice big table in front of the window.  We ordered an array of items given there were five of us -- chicken/fried steak and eggs, Texas scramble, banana walnut pancakes and a couple of deluxe breakfasts.  The food was really good... I mean, I know it is breakfast BUT the chicken fried steak was a huge hit (I took a bite and it was DELISH) as well as the fresh pancakes.  The menu states they prepare their batter fresh every day.  It is totally true.  As a pancake aficionado (among other things) they were fluffy, and the right amount of sweetness.  My Mom got the banana/walnut pancakes and she literally ate 3/4 of them and she eats pretty light.

It definitely looked like a lot of regulars like this joint, I can totally see why.  4 stars for the service, the pancakes and that amazing chicken fried steak!<//Review>< pics>

Overall great taste to the food with good wholesome. But honestly I find it a little odd to charge 3 dollars for a single pathetic size egg. literally 1 egg that is 10x the price of a egg. I understand it is a business but a dollar or 1.5 dollars is more than fair for a single egg.</Review>

Totally reminiscent of a mom and pop kind of place. The service was great, the food was great and the price didn't blow you at like some California eateries. It was clean. The restrooms smelled nice. I would go here again any day.<//Review>

It's all you'd expect from a mom and pop breakfast joint. Food is great, it isn't crowded and it does what it should. Feed your family at a good price.< /review>

<Text>'Sunset By The Park' is flattering. Maybe 'Smog By The Alley' would be more appropriate. If you went to a thrift store, bought some curtains from the 1920s then used them to cover the booth seats, you would be on your way to decorating this tired spot. Sausages looked like burnt fingers & there wasn't a heartbeat between all 4 waitresses. As the hideous Muzak played, I felt like crying as I dined.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I ordered Denver Omelette. No onions. Lite Cheese..  When it Arrived, it was a Mess.  Looked like Scrambled Eggs. It was not very warm even, as if it was sitting out waiting to be scooped up out of a pot. Not like a regular Omlette. I informed Owners wife, the waitress, who just shrugged her shoulders . Even home fries were only Luke warm.  Very disappointing.Waitress :(  Ugh. Sad.   I called & spoke w a man who said he will talk to ' her and the chef!  Disgusted.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>This place is TERRIBLE! They messed my entire order up, gave me attitude about it and then said "well we are going to charge you for it anyway so let us make you another plate". I didn't want another plate and the manager said, "It's ok, we are going to charge you for it anyway". After I went to the register to pay I asked the lady at he counter how they can justify charging me after admitting that they got nothing right with my order and I didn't eat it. She replied "That's the owners policy". I said "Can I speak to the owner", she said he wasn't there and that he is never there. Really disappointing and I will never go back.

<Review>The food was very good but the bathroom was not clean at all and I was there for breakfast so I just had to wonder if that is a reflection of the staff on the overall level of cleaniness. I will go back and if its always that way I will find it very hard to eat at this restaurant.< /Review>< user_id>

Went here for breakfast, food was OK. We also ordered a lunch, the rice and chicken was very bland.  Bathrooms need to be cleaned big time... Staff was nice, that's the only plus side here. This was our first and last time here.<//text>

<text>When I travel and a guilty pleasure is going to old school diners and try to avoid the chains like Denny’s. Usually its a great experience. Not so here. Huevos Rancheros served with Pace Picante out of the jar. Soggy stale chips and a small portion. $14 later I left hungry. The decor is tired and the staff appears to be family and cutting corners.
Its a grood spot and a large space. Great for someone who knows how to run a restaurant to take it over, get a full liquor license and make into a casual gastro pub.< /text>< name>

(Translated by Google) It lacks a lot of cleanliness to the place, from the bathrooms, very dirty floor and when taking the bottle sauce and catsup they are sticky, if that is what is in my sight, I do not want to see the kitchen.

Le falta mucha limpieza al lugar, desde los baños, piso muy sucio y al tomar la salsa de botella y catsup están pegajosos, si así está lo que está a mi vista, no quiero ver la cocina.<//text>

Delicious don't even start to describe it. The tortillas are so fresh you literally watch them make em. Sweet little waitress helped us out when we had her split the check four ways. A real nice experience.< /Text>

Been coming to this place for the last 2 years. This place has always been my favorite because it’s healthy and close to my job.Recently I have experienced some bad customer service on Sunday here as employees can’t hear me and respond with attitude, however José is not like wise. Super kind person and very good at cooking. I came for an online order and the cashier told me to wait in the long line for it.Jose said he wouldn’t let me wait because it was an online order then wrote down my order and made it himself. Very bad staff chipotle! Jose has never let me down since the day I’ve met him<//text>

<review>Employees are fine. The food is awesome and there are many things to choose from! You can have a burrito, taco, chips, guac or salsa, cheese quesadillas and other stuff. There are a lot of more things to put ON or IN your burrito or taco or whatever. Great place.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This is my first time eating Chipotle and it’s really bad I got a steak burrito and the tortilla was really hard and cold they barely even heat it up, the burrito had no flavor whatsoever. I would not recommend eating at this place, go to a local taqueria and they serve you bigger portions and better food.<//review>

Usually very good. Inconsistent on servings though. Too much or too little.</Review>

<review>Horrible! This is one of the worst chipotle I have ever eaten at! They will give you a really tiny quantity for the price that you are paying $7.15+++ and when you ask them to give you a little more meat they will charge you for extra or double $$! The workers there have such an awful attitude and they are so rude and disrespectful! I am proud and happy to say that I will never support chipotle again!<//review><user>117778685534070689671< /user><time>1436567864792< /time><Name>Bo Rego</Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I understand that they did not tell us that the guac was an extra charge and that they gave us an expired coupon but instead of apologizing they said they did not give us the coupon.we went back and tried to use the coupon (not knowing it is expired)a man we thought was a gentleman gave us less than a half what the coupon was worth.when we left the woman who messed up our order last time started laughing with the man who helped who was actually a fake.whats worst is that they started talking about us with the other customers patiently waiting for their food.Another thing I did not like was that another man took my soft tacos and started wrapping it in aluminum foil.Yuck!I am never coming back here because of the negativity and the amount unprofesionality.I do not want anything but an explanation for this rude and disrespectful restaurant.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Ok chipotle I've came here 3 times and I've gotten the same person (tall Hispanic male I believe )to serve me.i received great customer service from him, always smiles unlike others.last week is what brought me here.the male was serving food and was cashing everyone . There was a long line but he was quick. Unfortunately the guac dissapointed me because it was hard :( But he apologized and made me a new bowl happily and told me it's all about the customers satisfaction, that's so cute. Rate 3 stars for the customer service !!would give 5 if the guaco was better and if the carnitas weren't so dry</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808e33d5e608c8c7:0xa46bad2ce36f5181<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The lotus root was wonderfully crunchy to match with the shrimp in the pot. My only suggestion is blow out the flame as it just keeps everything too hot to eat, but it looks pretty.
And the spicy noodles had prickly ash / Szechuan peppercorns and were also a spicy and a most satisfying way. Simply good food.</review></record></dataset><record>

Sadly, this place is not a place we will not returning to. The sour vegetable and meat noodles are bland, it’s not sour, it’s not sweet, it’s not salty, it’s just blah. No taste to it. I feel like the vegetable was cut from those pre-packaged veggie bag and the sliced meat and dump in vegetable soup. Chow fun is not fun to eat, it salty and has no other taste. The wonton has one small piece of shrimp in it (from a shrimp chop in 4 pieces) and poorly wrapped wonton sheet. Again the soup has no taste to it. Not sure where all the 5 stars reviews are coming from but we did not enjoy the food as we were so excited to try this place.</text>

The best part here is how "nice" this place is for a Chinese restaurant. The store is very clean and waiters are very friendly, often stopping by to ask how our food is. Will come back again!<//Text><rating>5< /rating>< time>

Delicious. Entrees are definitely big enough to share. Our table of five ordered 5 entrees and an appetizer. We probably would have been fine with three. Table favorite was the spicy prawn clay pot. Pictured is spicy beef clay pot.<//Review>

<Text>Don’t let the unassuming presence fool you. Their Dan Dan noodles are a great deal, the Mapo Tofu is a must have, and they do some great spicy dumplings. I have ordered here probably 15 times and will keep going back.< /Text><username>Will Weingarten<//username>< GmapID>

<Review>The best Szechuan place in San Francisco period.  I go here with 1st Gen Asian people that say the same, if that helps any.  The frog is spectacular, the Dan Dan Mein is off the chain, and the Cumin with Lamb is amazing.  The Also, the House Cold Noodle is the one of the best things on the menu - it will make your face go numb.  Did I mention the staff is extremely friendly and personable. Incredible place.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Went with a high expectation after reading good reviews for vegetarian food, but felt the taste was only average. Tried the vegetable potstickers, Dan Dan noodles, Mapo Tofu. The tofu was extremely soft but didn't exactly feel as spicy as it was marked super spicy on the menu (note: my spice appetite is pretty good). Potstickers were good but the very popular noodles actually felt undercooked and very chewy - but the host said that's how they're prepared so I guess it didn't fit my palette but can work for others. Service was pretty friendly and ambience was casual.<//Text>

<Review>Food 4.5 fresh and well seasoned; Ambiance 3; Service 4.5 attentive and helpful; Nice balance of flavor and spice, my new favorite because of the variety for those who don't want spice and they are not shy about the spice if you like it hot; 2 people; $67</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My first time ordering here. I came to them because they were open on Christmas!!! I ordered extensively across the menu: hot and sour soup, iron pot fish, pea vine, Mongolian beef, Dan Dan noodles, among others. The food was spectacularly good, and it was waiting for me at the moment I walked through the door to pick it up. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough, and it's our new "go to" for takeout or eat-in Chinese food in San Francisco.< /Review>

I eat here regularly.  Beef and broccoli, salt and pepper squid, and spicy fried cabbage are a few of my favorite dishes.  Definitely recommend this place.</text>< user_name>

Fantastic Chinese food. My wife and I went this week and ordered the fish in the clay pot, wontons with chili sauce, and the Dan Dan noodles. We really appreciated the quality of the food. One of the best places in the city for good authentic Chinese food.</Review>

<time>1580691499391</time><Rating>3< /Rating><text>They have a little section of Vegetable and Tofu, nearly all of which was veg (but be careful and ask to be sure).

Our helpful server confirmed that the Mapo Tofu and the Eggplant in Sauce were both veg, so we ordered those two with rice. Both were good enough, albeit oily, and some spice in the mapo seemed odd to me. And it was not inexpensive.

I don't really have a need to return.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Ordered the: Pork dumpling, zha Chengdu ZaJiang Noodles, Tofu with Minced PorkAll some of the best in their category (Sichuan) in 626. By the time we figured out payment (Apple Pay wasn't working), food was an hour past offering, and aside from being slightly cooler - still yummy. Would reorder noodles - best zhajiang I've had in the area, dumplings were slightly above average (prefer thicker/chewier skin); tofu was slightly above average.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Waitress asked me to leave after I had diner and paid.

The food was good but the service was bad specially at the end of my diner. When I got here there were two adults and a girl in a table for six. They were waiting for the other people to join them. Well, I ordered my food, I eat them. I asked for left overs to go and I ordered a rice to go, too. After I paid, a waitress came and asked me to leave because there were people waiting to seat down. Wow!!!! I just can’t believe she said that. She never asked the other people to leave who were here way before me. I feel like asking for the tips I left, but I didn’t. So, I won’t come back here and I don’t recommend it.< /Text>

Started off with flavorful, tender spring rolls and each subsequent dish was better than the last. The house special spicy fried rice was outstanding, as was the Mongolian beef. The staff was very friendly, and I can't wait to go back.</text>< name>

Fish with sauerkraut is delicious. Just be mindful it, like many of their whole fish dishes, is priced per pound. Overall good food and enjoyed the "ma la" flavor of those Szechuan peppercorns! Portions are good so be sure to take home your leftovers< /review>

<Text>Dan dan noodles are delicious, the spicy chili sauce is good if you don't mind an adundance of chili flakes. Dumplings are also a good choice, pork or vegetarian. Their flat noodles are delicious but the meat I've had in it wasn't that fresh. The chicken cubes are fried and crispy with a lot of decadent sauce, sesame is my favorite.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3< /gmap_id>< user_name>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Good Szechuan-style Chinese food. To be honest, I'm not sure if I knew exactly what to expect from the Szechuan style but I gave it a try and was not disappointed. We ordered a lot of different items, here is the price and how I would rate each:

Dried Sauteed String Beans $12.50
Good (3 out 5)

Kung Pao Chicken $12.25
Good (3 or 4 out of 5)

Stir Fried Mongolian Beef $13.75
Good (3 out of 5)

Combination Chow Mein $11.50
Good (3 or 4 out of 5)

Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle $8.25
Good (5 out of 5)

Service, Price, and Delivery Speed:
5 out of 5: absolutely no complaints, everything was perfect!

If I need quick Chinese food again I will definitely go to this place. If I want to try to find the best Chinese food around, I will probably keep trying different places before I make a final call.</Text>< Pictures>

Extremely tasty, especially the house noodles and the iron pot fish fillet. Full of flavor and spice. Food came out extremely quickly, and the service was very attentive.< /text>

<review>Got the cumin beef as it seemed like a favorite here, I would highly recommend getting it. The fried cabbage was unlike any vegetable I’ve had - really great.

Service was incredibly nice. Had a great time.</review>< Resp>

Delicious and affordable. I usually get the Dan Dan noodles special. One of the better spots for Szechuan food in the city.</text>

<review>One of the best places in the city to get poached fish in szechuan chili oil. Great wontons, dumplings, and cumin lamb too,and you'll be stuffed on a bill you'd normally expect for one person in this city. Great boba milk tea next door!<//review>< name>

Both places we were planning to go to had lines out the door, so we wandered down the street and this was the first place that caught my eye. What a great choice! Delicious, very authentic Szechuan food. Waitstaff was very friendly, made some good suggestions, and was accommodating of our request to substitute vegetable dumplings instead of pork dumplings in one of the appetizers. Three appetizers and one large entrée was about the right amount of food for three people. The fried fish covered in red chilies and sichuan peppercorns was everything I hoped for.< /Text>

Food came late. Appetizer came 10 min after main dish. Food was bland, but quick service saved them a star. The food came after 5 minutes.

Edit: After looking at other people's food, we realized we might have made bad dish choices</text>

We went to eat at this restaurant and we bought 4 dishes. First, let's wait for about 35 minutes to give us the first dish. The speed of serving is very slow. Ask the waiter, she said, wait a minute, and she spoke slobber, disgusting, very bad attitude, we are going Eat instead of eating angry. And the taste of the food is very poor, this is the worst I have ever eaten, I have never encountered such a bad restaurant.< /review>

<text>I was walking by to grab some lunch and i found this spot. Never had Szechuan food before and was willing to give it a try and this place did not disappoint. I tried the dan dan noodles and were amazing. Spice was just perfect for me. I totally recommend. You can get it either with pork or veggie style. And their veggie potstickers were really good. Great flavor and they were a little toasty so it was perfect. If I'm ever again visiting the area I will definitely stop by again. And the service was great as well.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3<//Gmap_id></record>

An underrated place for relatively authentic Szechuan food! The owners are extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is cozy and comfortable.

Make sure to try the cumin beef and iron pot offerings when you're here you won't regret it. Lots of great spicy food and a pretty long menu. It can be a bit pricey but not bad for the city. My wife and I have made this place our regular go-to for spicy Chinese food!

P.S. - it's not called tofu village anymore. It's called Szechuan Cuisine with a big red sign.< /text>

The restaurant changed ownership a few years ago, and the old reviews don't reflect the new place. This is a Chinese restaurant with a very friendly wait staff. The food is exceptionally good, cheap, and always very quick. Have been here over 5 times already and will keep coming.<//Text>

<gmapID>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3</gmapID><Review>NPR said, sichuan or Szechuan food is the next big cuisine to take over the planet. I believed them and decided to hunt for the best Sichuan restaurant. Exhibit A - voila - Szechuan cuisine.

What makes szechuan cuisine very interesting is a unique blend of spices. Not hot per se, but have this numbing sensation, that numbs your tongue, mouth, but in a pleasant way.

You can ask for the level of spice to be turned down - we didn't - and we survived to tell the tale.

The menu is overwhelming, over 100 items, some with photos, and strange sounding concoctions. But you can ask the server for recommendations (they are super friendly). I asked for veggie and seafood, and the wife wanted the best dim sums (they recommended pork in chili oil). We had tofu, shrimp and greens-based apps and entrees. You cannot go wrong - none of the 5 items we tried was a doozy.

Great flavors, no MSG, great service (yes, in an Asian restaurant), and food prepared with love - this is your destination du delicious jour.<//Review><Date>1552675200600</Date>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>You can delete my review by paying money to YELP,

But you can not delete here!

firstly, we went there several times, the food they recommended us were bad at all.

Those which we ordered by ourselves were ok.

I think they were not good because we forgot our belongings but they said did not know at all.

They claimed that they helped me to looking for it but in fact? I don't know.

Specially, after I posted my review on YELP,

The owner sent me a mesage which is very impolite and said that it was my fault and no one should have looked it for us.

I was surprised.

A good restaurant should improve their service when facing the negative review,
but they do not,

They criticize their customers and send some horrible mails and delete the negative reviews by money.

Everyone has the power to tell us their experience in your place,

So give up your foolish behavior and think about how to improve your bad service!

There is few people in your place in spite of the noon,

Why?

You know the answer.

No problem , if you can , delete this by paying money to google, Lol<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
So sad the old Tofu Village had to go away and was replaced by this awful establishment.

Food was not great. I got the mapo tofu lunch special and the wontons in chili oil. Pretty standard Sichuan dishes to use as a measuring stick. The lunch special comes with soup and some vegetables. Those were fine. The mapo tofu was all in all pretty awful. It was spicy, sure, but that's all it was. The tofu itself was too firm and too sour. The sauce was not salty enough, so you only taste the bitterness of the spice. The wontons were okay, but nothing to write home about.

If it were just bad food, I wouldn't have given it one star, because there could be other dishes that were better. But what made it a 1-star for me is the fact that I got sick later that day. I usually don't get sick from food unless it's really bad so something was wrong with the food since I didn't eat anything after that for the rest of the day.</Review>

I ordered very spicty Tofu soup and they put jalapeno in the soup. It was like sliced can jalapeno and korean ppl DO NOT put jalapenos in tofu soup. I asked to change it for us and the ownder was yelling like "this is how we make spicy." and told us not to eat spicy one if you can eat it. And again it is NOT korean style spicy!!! don't go there. just drive to geary and go to tofu house. WAY better!!! Or u can try and compare the tofu soup.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) First of all, this restaurant tastes good. I like boiled fish very much. However, I think the most important thing is to go to eat! The black restaurant in Clement Street that I went to before, in addition to the taste is not good, the biggest problem is that the service is very poor, none of the employees have a smile. This store is different, the service is good, and the smile is nice. So I think it's worth recommending

(Original)
首先，这家的味道不错，水煮鱼我很喜欢。但是，我觉得去吃饭，最重要的还是服务！之前去的Clement街那家黑色店面的湘菜馆，除了味道不好吃以外，最大问题是服务很差，老板员工没有一个有笑容的。这家店不一样，服务很好，笑容很Nice。所以，我觉得值得推荐</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr3oUAoEWcJKrq2LDg3_NMf-WHW0Nyx-h7JOGz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><gmapID>0x8085876f88db7083:0x13532df4f8c514b3<//gmapID>< rating>

Amazing beer selection and pet friendly! They have indoor and outdoor dining available right now and was quite busy this Saturday evening but outdoor seating became available as the hour passed.  Great beer and they have a outdoor food vendor< /review>

This has become our go to spot with everything opening back up.  Safe, in the sun, and tasty brews in their courtyard.  Everyone that works here is amazing and nice. Special shout out to Amber who is always attentive and hospitable.

Codebreaker IPA below.

They are really and truly great.  Everyone is very knowledgeable about the craft and always helpful to get you just beer you're looking for. The steps they've taken to protect employees and customers during COVID show how much they truly care about the community. Trademark is always my top suggestion for people coming in from out of town.< /Review><Time>1606343647204</Time>< Gmap_id>

A brand new spot (open for a week when I went according to staff) with absolutely gorgeous open space in a reclaimed warehouse style building. It's with a visit solely to see all of the gorgeous wood and open design. 9 beers on, with flights, small and large pours available. Staff seemed a little unsure and green, but that's to be expected this early. Beers were decent but nothing stood out much, but again learning a new system can take time to dial in. I'm looking forward to seeing how they progress.< /review>

They are my neighbor in Downtown Long Beach and I can't tell you how happy I am that they are there.  GREAT BEER, Tremendous staff and very cool atmosphere.  Did I mention great beer?!?!?!  All of my teammates enjoy grabbing an afternoon treat at Trademark.</review>

Having moved out of Long Beach, I was starting to miss this local brewery. Decided to do a drive through to see what new beers they had available and ended up picking up 2 growlers and a 4pk. The staff was very professional and made sure everyone abide by the rules we now face in a Covid society.< /text>

Neat place to have a beer with your family and friends! They do not serve food but they had some packaged snacks that saved the day! We loved the fact that our kiddo was able to have some fun while we enjoyed some beers. They have some games: corn hole, connect four, and stacking blocks.</text>

Great beer in a clean, spacious setting. I visited on a Saturday between 2-5 and the brewery wasn’t overly crowded. I tasted a number of beers and left impressed with Trademark’s lineup. Standout beers for me: On Center Helles Lager and Hat Trick Belgian Tripel. I appreciate the variety of beer styles offered here.< /text>

<Review>Fresh new brew pub. Super spacious,clean lines and newer fashioned interior. Great selection of beers and on site brewery.
Has a great atmosphere and  food truck twist to its  food menu. Highly recommend  for gatherings. Parking is the only issue.</Review>< rate>

Great tasting beer. I usually wouldn't recommend a flight but they have great tasting well balanced flavors. You're going to enjoy it.< /Text>

First; Walking up I loved the embrace of the street art. It's a beautiful area with an amazing site both inside and out.
Second; The employee was friendly and kind. They seemed like they enjoyed working there and it showed.
Third; I was so happy with the beer!!! I got 5 tasters and LOVED 3 of them and liked the other 2. It's rare that all 5 are strong but they knocked it out of the park. Obviously I followed up with a few full pints once the taster was done.

Overall I loved it. If I was still local I'd go weekly. I have 2 small gripes.... 1.) No stickers?!?! They have all sorts of shirts and hats but not a single sticker. 2.) Crowler prices. Crowlers were $16-18 which is crazy high. That's $8-9 a pint. I had planned on getting at least 3 crowlers but with that price I stuck with just 1.... which was to bad because I wanted to take then home with me and let others try this new delicious brewery...... BUUUTTTT it was all good. Great place. Go there.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_cnaU8Y5JdvKKMiOFceYddSohvc8ygJPDUA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0_jOfK2k45CvR_HQRI_rswZwIwh3yD_yCSA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlzZeFjrIcFXeRaVApWL-5bgyPBCsT333Lgw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMjT6-c1l8cCAshwzqR4nGGcM_3ygdjloQfg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Amazing space, staff and beer - I love the food truck options too. Large parking lot in the back makes it easy to come meet up with friends in the area. Love the outdoor patio and games as well. Looking forward to trying out the climbing gym across the way! Can’t wait to visit again!</text>

The poster featured Peter and all his women of Season 24 of the Bachelor Reality Show.
It was hanging right next to the big TV above the bar.< /Text>< user>

<resp>None</resp><review>This new LB brewery is awesome. They're still working out kinks and rolling out new beers. Lots of space, they even have private event space and space for Cornhole. Plenty of tables. Website says they are dog friendly and that was proven when I walked in and there were 3 dogs there. The 10-hour stout is amazing. Can't wait for their beer menu to be full!

As for parking: There's also limited parking on Locust and other nearby streets. Theres hope that the lot behind the brewery will be available for parking soon.

Will be back soon! Especially with sours and porters on the way :)< /review>< username>

<text>Actually just drove past this place heading somewhere else and my Uber driver told me this place was new. I decided to come in and have five or six beers. Every single thing I tried was very mediocre. even the West coast style beers that I normally expect to be really good we're very subpar. But the location is great, the atmosphere is awesome and the service was top notch. Hopefully they can get the beers in line because that's why we come.<//text></record>

<Text>Stopped by on Sunday afternoon.  Its a beautifully renovated older building with tons of character.  They also have a patio outside with places to sit.  Parking in the area is a bit of a challenge.  Tried a couple of flights and felt that only one of the beers was good, not great.  Their WCIPA and other IPAs were lacking in aroma and that hop feel on your palate.  Hopefully they can get these beers in line as the location and service is great.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<user_name>Paul B< /user_name><Time>1564886216213< /Time><review>Nicely designed taproom with games and plenty of two- and four-top tables and picnic tables.  The beer is solid, but choices are limited since they’re rather new.  Like so many other breweries today, IPAs figure too heavily here.  The stout is a flavorful alternative to the six IPAs they have.  For fans of lighter beers, try the kolsch.  Sadly the service is snotty and pedantic. The point of sale space is inefficient and Millennial-techy-cool.  Branding reigns supreme here with taste and service coming next.</review>< userid>

<Text>Been here a handful of times. Not a huge parking area but sufficient enough to get the job done. Seems pretty organized and the people that work here are friendly.

I have gone to a few different recycle centers and this is by far the best!! They take just about everything and the people are so nice and always willing to give you a hand. Thank you for such great service!!! 😊</Review>

***Customers Beware***This place is a CHEATER I have brought 280 bottles at 5 cents each should equal to $14 in return but they only paid $12.17 in other words your are losing 1.5 cents for every item you give them. Avoid this place, don't give them your business! We demand what we paid for when stores charged us for redemption.< /text>

<Text>BEWARE!! I brought in my cans here and everything went well until they cashed me out. Paper said I was to be paid $57 but when counting the money they guy made errors on purpose and rushed me to take my money. Upon counting it at home, I realized they shorted me $5! Which is literally 100 bottles that they stole from me.

So if you don't care about you're money then go here!! But if you do care about your money go somewhere else. Other reviews are very similar.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Very crowded on weekend and rushed through line. Instead of actual weighing their containers he just guesstimated the weight. For all the recycles I brought I usually get more cash at another place. Also employees unprofessional with their language no consideration of children present. I don't believe I got a fair weight/price of my recycles.< /text><date>1584023306716<//date><Name>Lola Trevino<//Name>< Pics>

No attempt at customer service and greedy exchanges. Me and a relative came with 6 full large trash bags of water bottles and jugs. We received not even 15 dollars while a past recycling center nearby gave more than 20 dollars for 4 bags of the same size. I recommend Ming's recycling center high above this and any other recycling center.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Shamloo is wonderful.  He explains everything about your condition so that you can thoroughly understand it.  I find him to be very knowledgeable, kind and easy to talk to.  His staff is very nice and I love that I am always seen within 15 minutes of stepping into his offices.<//review><GmapID>0x80c2ba2f09a54d15:0x284e2d5fb1439005< /GmapID>< Time>

<Name>Audrey Peters</Name><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Dr Shamloo...is a great Dr at what he do.  Due to the fact I have had two rear enders in one year my back was really in a bad situation. I had to get a couple of back injections due to these accidents. Due to his professionalism I am on the way to total recovery. ✝️hank 🙏🏽 You Dr Shamloo and staff. I am wearing my upper back support and dealing with the neck traction support also he suggested I get to help with my total recovery. Totally...and getting better...I will be even better after this..<//Review>< Rating>

Dr. Shamloo recently gave me PRP for a torn rotator cuff. I learned in January it was torn after an MRI. The injury was from blunt force trauma and a dislocated shoulder, the worst pain I have ever experienced! I was determined not to have surgery and did the PRP with P.T. I am so much better and I didn't have to go through that horrible, expensive surgery. I am very grateful to Dr. Shamloo and his staff. "IT WORKS!"<//Review>

<response>None<//response><review>My wife was elated with Dr. Shamloo even more post post procedure.
As far as myself, we were hoping for some minimum to short term relief leading to a more  permanent pain solution. However it has been 24 hours now with no pain at all.
Dr. Shamloo is very professional, personal and explains everything in detail  We cannot recommend him highly enough.</review>< Pics>

<text>I can’t believe how smooth and painless was my neck epidural injection done by Dr. Shampoo without anesthesia. The care and the service are the highest level possible. It’s nice to walk, move and live without pain.

Dr. Shamloo is extremely professional but a great Dr. That explains all the problems and procedures that are going to be performed. You feel good your In the right hands. His confidence is amazing because he's trustworthy and he's proffessional. Dr. Shamloo has years of experience in many different aspects of the spine, stem cells, trigeminial nerve blocks, trigger point injections, stimulation implant in 2016,
inter spinious injections, epidural injections. Then there is Dr. Shamloo education Cedar Sanai, University of Washington Pain Management. Charles Drew/UCLA medical university internal medicine. These are some of my personal medical experience procedures that I've been through with
Dr. Shamloo. I know I am in the right ha de and 6 years ago I was in a wheelchair 300llbs. Today as his patient with him by my side throughout my 6 years. I  walk without the implant and weigh down to 180. So, if you want a new beginning I  highly recommend Dr. Shamloo for any problems you might serious start af the Elighte Spine and Pain Institute and ask for the best, Dr. Shamloo.
Thank you Dr. Shamloo for helping me walk again.<//Text>

Amazing service, the guy who took our order was very kind and offered us water while we waited for our to-go order. Food was amazing and tasted homemade. 10/10 would recommend to anyone in the area.<//Text>

Really really really good! We loved it! We ate so much I am surprised I can breath.
The food was made fresh and the bread nan was perfect! The prices are reasonable and the location is nice with parking on the rear!  We had the mixed appetizers,  fried rice, mushrooms , and chicken vindalo.
The customer service was really good too! The waiter was nice to us and made recommendations and checked on us to make sure we were good .<//Text>

OMG, I absolutely love love love this place! It was our first time here. Saleem was amazing! He answered all my questions and was ready with suggestions. (I appreciate that) We had a beautiful spread of such aromatic dishes. We are definitely scheduling a monthly visit here. The ambiance, food, and service is on point. I wish more places where this good!! 💕😋🙌

Oh no, the worst biryani I ever tasted.I wouldnt even call it a biryani though, its just full of turmeric powder with green peas. The guy at front desk was so interactive had good conversation but the taste of food is not even below average.< /review>

Don't buy food from here. You will waste your money. Price of all the items are higher on Uber eats compared to their restaurant menu price. Even after charging high price, the quality of food is very low. They don't even give curries with biryani after charging higher prices.< /Text>

If you're looking for great Indian food this is the place! Food is great, service is amazing, and you'll leave feeling full and happy. I highly recommend this place and you have to try their vegetable samosas, they're so good.</Review>

<Review>I'd never been a big fan of Indian food, nor craved it, until I ate here. The staff/owners are fun and inviting, and the food is amazing. I got medium spicy chicken vindaloo curry with rice. Had a good kick and was very filling. Just writing this made my mouth water! Can't wait to come back.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I’m originally from England and love a curry and can concur this is the best curry I’ve had period! Myself and a few other curry enthusiasts have visited several restaurants in the valley/LA area and all agreed this is the best one we’ve been to. Service is great and food is amazing! They get the spice perfect for your liking as other restaurants either go too mild or too spicy. I’ve had the chicken bhuna and lamb rogan Josh and would recommend both but I can almost guarantee you’ll be happy with any curry you get. I will 100% be a regular to this place...10/10< /review>

Amazing flavor! And amazing service! Everyone was so kind and was very attentive and yet not smothering. I don't usually like India food but everything about my food from the spices too the authenticity was amazing. And if you have a choice for a server. Choose Saleem! He'll take care of you 100%!

Only thing I would say they need to work on is a name tag 😜 as I had to look at the check for our amazing server's name.</Text>

Such a good meal / experience! I arrived and had to only wait 2 minutes, but they made up for my food not being ready by giving extra Naan and a drink.

Everything was delicious and I’m excited to go back!<//text>

This is literally my favorite restaurant in the Valley. The host, Salim, is excellent, the service is second to none, the food is spectacular and you can watch Ventura Blvd go by while you eat.

Do what’s good for you and order the Lamb Pasanda. I would literally drink the sauce if I could.< /Text>

<review>Allow me to begin by saying that this is a completely unsolicited review. I am giving it selfishly because the food was so delicious I want to make sure they stay in business a long time so that I can continue coming here for years to come.

I love Indian cuisine and consider myself a connoisseur. Being from New York my standards for international cuisine are very high. Masala house has only been open for about a week now but I can say without hesitation it is some of the best Indian food I've had in Los Angeles to date. The Chicken Tikka Masala was perfect! The Sag Dahl was wonderfully spiced and the Eggplant Bharta texture and flavor was divine. Oh, and the veggie samosas were the most flavorful I've had in a long long time.

The service was far above standard. Do your self and your palate a favor and come taste the flavors. Truly wonderful food and experience!

-update-
Sometimes I order from here 2-3 times a week, it never disappoints. And don't believe the Yelp rating, this joint is 5-stars, they're just being squeezed by the yelp mafia, all the bad reviews are from people without names who are likely jealous competitors. I've personally tried complaining about the BS reviews but yelp does nothing.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Tried this place with my family for the 1st time. Excellent service and food. We had chicken tikka masala, coconut chicken curry, and lamb korma, along with some naan. Everything was great, the sauces are incredibly flavorful and creamy. Portions are average sized, but everything seems to come with basmati rice. Strongly suggest giving this place a try.

There is a small parking lot in back. Otherwise there is street parking which is metered.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Best indian restaurant in the valley and for sure los angeles as well.  Super friendly. Super clean,  great food.  My favorite is the chicken tikka masala. Their naan and parathas are great also.  Dinners include rice!!!! Lol no one usually does that.  Samosas are  too small for me but worth a try because they are tasty as well< /Review>

<Review>This place is aaaaamazing!! Best Indian food I have come across in the LA area. It’s clear that they use fresh ingredients and spices. The service was amazing from the greeting to the check. We had the samosas, chicken tikka masala, chicken coconut curry, and mango lassi. All of which I highly recommend! I’ll be bragging about this place for a while.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The entire experience was straight forward, quick and easy. They will text you an image of your order once they complete it, I guess shortly before delivering. I ordered Saturday and got my text image Monday morning about an hour or so before delivery around 11:00 AM. The flowers were just as nice, if not nicer, than the sample arrangement image example that I chose from at their website. I am very pleased with everything. Would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

This florist is spectacular.  Their arrangements are beautiful and the customer service is beyond description!  The staff were so careful to send photos of the exact arrangement we ordered.  They kept me posted throughout the delivery process as well.   I highly recommend this family owned business.</Review>

Amazing people creating beautiful bouquets.
Unfortunately, the delivery person ran in to some snags (our fault entirely) yet they stuck it out, kept in contact and got the flowers delivered. The flowers are stunning, the service superb, I would highly recommend this business.
Thank you Amore Dolce Flowers and Chocolates for all of your hard work and dedication.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I also appreciate that, in the rush of a hectic day like Mother's Day, they took the time to ensure I was satisfied with my pick-up order before I left. And supporting my local smaller businesses is always a plus!<//Review>< Pictures>

They have beautiful flowers (the recipient kept saying how big and beautiful the roses were!), they texted me a picture of the flowers before delivery so I knew exactly what they were getting, they texted me when it was delivered.

A week ago, I went to your shop for the reason that I will buy some bouquet of flowers. It is my routine of buying a bouquet and transferred it into a vase. I thanked your florist for suggesting to me this bouquet that has sunflowers and white roses. Very satisfying and excellent service! I must surely introduce your Flower shop to my friends!<//text>

Lovely service and bouquet. They had to change the vase, so they called and texted me a photo of the new one to make sure it was okay. Then, for the card, I put "Happy anniversary :)" thinking it was printed. It's a handwritten card, but they actually drew the smiley face, which made my girlfriend's day because it was just so cute and wholesome. Delivered same-day, on time, and I couldn't be happier. And the bouquet smells beautiful! 13/10 would recommend.< /review>

<Text>Wow I was missing that special friend due to the lockdown of Cornoa virus... and thought... you know what.. i'm gonna send all my family members flowers.. So I gave Vic a call at Amore dolce flowers and told him go nuts under $500... and he literally went nuts.. everyone got the largest most beautiful bouquet of floral perfection you could imagine. It was soo cool.  Everything went perfect.

A great way to reach out to loved ones without having to leave the house!!!

Stay home - Order for delievery

Thanks so much Amore Dolce Flowers for helping me show my family I'm still thinking about them, and they are not alone!!

They have really good roses which last long and fully open blossom.
They did nice wrapping even I didn't mention anything.

Amore Dolce has always been there for my family and I for our flower arrangements.

Also very community oriented. Asia helped our family when my uncle passed away in donating purple ribbon so we could honor my uncles wishes by placing purple ribbons along Montebello Blvd for cancer awareness. The owner Asia is always very helpful. If you need flowers this is the place to go. You will not be disappointed.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2d1d4e5c113ff:0xf79bf29e813f2fe4< /gmap_id>< Pics>

< review>
Where do I even begin?! I like to view reviews on yelp before I even attempt to head to any location whether it be food, flowers, nails shops.. you name it.. I look! The first thing I noticed is that Amore Dolce Flowers had way more positive reviews than negative which is a major plus! I don't even understand why it would get any negative reviews because the quality of their beautiful flowers and amazing customer service always has me going back for more. If there's even a slight chance you may not be 100% happy at the time, they will go out of their way to make sure you are 100% happy! Any business that goes above and beyond like they do has my absolute respect and business. Don't let any negative review stop you from visiting this shop. Go see for yourself and have your own experience! You will NOT be disappointed.

This is my absolute favorite flower shop! I do not go anywhere else! I've been coming here for over 2 years and have not once been disappointed. You get assistance as soon as you walk in the door. It doesn't matter what budget you're on, they are always so happy to assist and take so much pride in their service and arrangements. All my arrangements have lasted a long time. If you take care of yours they will last long too! Every single one of them is very helpful, and they are just all around amazing people. I love you guys! Thank you for always providing amazing customer service and beautiful arrangements! See you soon!!<//review>

Bought flowers, chocolates and gifts from here many times, even had them do my wife's baby shower! Very professional and caring, the owners are very creative and always made sure we were happy. Even though I moved out of the area to East Whittier making the trip to Montebello is well worth it, I have never had a bad experience coming here.</text>

When I first called, I appreciated the help and suggestions they offered but I’m pretty sure they suggested some roses they needed to get rid of. I got a dozen roses delivered way after my requested delivery time and they wilted in 4 days. I over-paid for what I got, disappointed.< /review>

Stopped by and waited in line and some older lady asked me what I wanted and how much I was going to spend. I told her i wanted a simple bouquet with a few roses added as that's what I got the last couple of times I've went and when I said it usually comes to 20-30 bucks she brushed me off and said they wouldn't be able to help me. There I was, time wasted standing in line and money wasted having taken an Uber to get there.  It really sucks because the last time I was there I made small talk with the guy in charge and he was talking about how they take pride and always go above and beyond for their usuals....yet if they weren't going to make some money off me, they pushed me aside. I ended up walking up the street to the Vons by the rite aid as I recalled they had a flower department and ended up putting together a nice bouquet myself. Had it not been for Vons my plans would've been ruined as I barley made it on time to surprise my girlfriend at work with flowers.
It just gave me a nasty feeling to be tossed aside because I had a budget of 30 dollars. I hope these guys treat the community with equality and more respect.<//Text>< Pictures>

My husband has been coming here for a while and loves it. He’s picky about who does his hair and they always do great. Today we took our son, who hates getting his hair cut. So kind and patient and did a great job! Now we have a regular place for my husband and son!<//review>

About 2 years ago S & N Barber Shop was recommended to me by a friend and I went in not really knowing what to expect... As I was sitting in the chair, talking to one of the owners, Sarmad, about what to do with my hair he stopped and simply asked me if I trusted him. Never having met this guy before I was hesitant, but he seemed confident so I figured, why not?

Then he not only proceeded to give me the best haircut I've ever had, but he completely transformed my look into something I never really considered for myself. Since that day my style has completely changed and my self-confidence has gone way up. I've never let anyone other than Sarmad cut my hair since.

Plus, Sarmad and I have grown to become great friends and someone I look forward to seeing! Isn't that what we all want? Nobody likes sitting there awkwardly with a barber you don't really know...

We can all agree that our hair is more than just hair. It says a lot about us, not only to others but to ourselves. So you have to find someone you trust...and take my word for it...S & N Barber Shop will ALWAYS take care of you. Even if you don't like your haircut, they always make it right...which is why I can't believe anyone would give them anything other than 5 stars.

So I challenge you to stop looking around now... just go get your haircut there and tell me I'm wrong!<//review>

My barber was professional and did an amazing job. I've had a rough time with barbershops in the past and just felt like my hair always came out wrong but this place was fantastic. I also had my eyebrows threaded for the first time and honestly been a long time since I felt this good about myself. I'll be back without a doubt.<//Text>

Sarmad gave an excellent cut, trim and shave for a very good price for such quality. I have selected barbers carefully, having had bad cuts before, and S&N has been consistently great!

Sarmad was great about taking my request and making informed suggestions based on his experience.<//Text>

<review>First let me say that I rarely leave reviews, but felt compelled to now.
Sarmaad and Naseem are the definition of the American Dream. Not only are they both true masters of there craft, they are both honest, loyal hardworking Men with beautiful families they adore.
And I can guarantee you the Soyboy that left a one star review is a full blown low T *male* Karen who regularly asks “I need to speak to the Manager” aka impossible to please.< /review>< pictures>

Went here prior to new ownership always got a great cut. checked it out with new ownership and still received a great cut! The two brothers are great very friendly and do excellent fades. This is the kind of family business I love to support. The price is still fair and cheaper then you would find elsewhere for the same great cut. Highly recommend this place!< /Review>

So happy I found this spot. I just moved to the area and hate having to do the  "look for a barber" routine. Turns out this little gem is right around the corner and I couldn't be happier. Naseem and Sarmad are extremely professional and take their time to make sure your hair is done right. Not the cheapest haircut you can find, but you definitely get what you pay for here. Great price for great cut!! My new hometown barber for sure!!<//Review>

I've gotten Great Cuts by both brothers. Sometimes there can be a wait but that is how all good things go. Way better than any chain and your money is going towards the community than some Corporation. They're my go-to guys and wife approved<//review>

Sarmad and Naseem are great at their job. I have been coming to this barber shop in La Mesa since they took ownership over a year ago. My take my son to and they always deliver what my 9 year old wants. If you are looking for a great barber shop near you this is the place to go. Great hair cuts and great customer service.</Review>

Naseem one of the owners really knows how to take care of his customers. He always delivers amazing fades and treats everyone really well. You can tell he really cares about his customers and is just not there to collect money from people like other La Mesa barber shops I have been to. My 9-year-old son also loves coming to see Naseem for his haircut. They are open Sundays which is very rare for any barbershop to do that. I highly recommend S & N Barber Shop And Master Shave is you are looking for a barbershop in La Mesa, Ca.</Text>

Went here for the first time and my barber was Mark. He did an awesome job and took his time to make sure hair was cut right and no skin lines!!! He listens to what you want and couldn't be happier with my hair cut. Swing by and ask for Mark.< /review>

I’ve been coming to Sarmad for the past 3 years now. I haven’t found a better barber yet, the guys make sure you leave looking sharp & customer service is awesome.< /review>

< Review>
This place is amazing! Definitely give it a try. It's very clean, the interrior looks super stylish and classy, chair was comfy! They have good music, tv for entertainment and waiting area have water.

Jenn the stylist who worked on my hair did an amazing job! I booked an appointment for hair color from black to balayage blonde. She took her time to work with me, was thorough, detail oriented and super professional. I highly recommend her for both color and haircut! She works with both men and women hair.

I recommend this place for any style and ages!

Loved my experience beyond expectation.</Review>

Since you’re not a member, you may not be aware that things have moved outside (like how the order states) and you wouldn’t know all the precautious we take to ensure safety of our members. Capacity limits, temp checks, cleaning and sanitizing every 1.5 hours. You also have not seen the hundreds of emails and phone calls we’ve received begging us to operate because our members worry about their mental health and wellness. Mental health is absolutely essential. I also assume you own your own business so you know how difficult this has been, especially since we’re a small family owned business. Let us know what business you own so we can support you during these very difficult times. God bless!'}< /resp>< GmapID>

Love the upgrade and everything about the gym except for the closing hours on weekends they need to at least close around 12am that would be perfect!< /Review>

Absolutely must visit place in San Francisco.

I booked cruise from official website and I wasn’t disappointed. I visited Alcatraz with my family and we loved every bit of it.
I highly recommend to be there at the boarding gate at-least 45 minute before start time. Boarding process was smooth and timely.

They even provide tram service for people with medical condition. My parents found it really helpful and really appreciated the service.

We took the map to roam around and jail tour was really helpful and full of information.

Long story short, I highly recommend this cruise for all ages given tram service they provide :)</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>They sure have improved from 20 years ago when I first visited Alcatraz. The ticketing process is much more streamlined, and the boarding process is also smoother with 5 million other people from all over the world trying to get the same Alcatraz experience. The announcements are clear, and directions easy to follow, but the ticketing agents  need to learn how to smile. For beginners, the ferry ride is about 12 minutes to or from the island of Alcatraz, and the ride can be bumpy at times depending on the Wind of the day. Before you board you can check out the model of the island and the cannon replicas around the dock before you get assimilated into the Alcatraz experience.</review>< pics>

The boats take you out to sea and have audio throughout most of the way to explain which is great.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlN2vsAMZ5YPE2kFfiMHOy7HmqGNH3RLOG0xcS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqIAkX-XJlBNBbZkKyWMOFZ33vCbulyYoF_eXE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCwBciy9eOH1H5l8JgzrRE-miXnwFLPfDpdOl6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHiumynyq1dXAze7DtoJY_AK0T20OQzTbwMecE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2G1vs-C8giPeaOhg9qsYzhnmkfErRwtZ-jWpY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORz8YFxGqXxqfJ19QWA2HoK1uK71rU6GM2w99a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWGwcF0RVOL6Ecb1KqJTPe-lY4OjWc0F_lZxPP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObe7dEEwLIvhfenrXn580ND2hyLE5PGVL9hacz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnmANyp-sRgzrUoWMFtEM3o9mmL8fJSj-lbeXh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOISUEiaebFEpRejhlpu9kuR6-lSVMTPGcTjqtI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM--T1XIx0GCR7An2IhMZqrDuSTIi9afcNaxnI4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMylfqduHjDA8sVvu638P6vZnZDMQOtVeIwQRpZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ21vnlJGf_HfAltr6rp78ziG-wL_o2G_6VCUb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjES1cgoLc38k24od9FfT35_TR3l5xn9_yCzf_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ4-ZKzXdNOJPxMtvhSIMJbs2I7328aPwlVGpk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtf7VVAsSP_-x5r7JvEyc2DcdH66LDcaiLQKQC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAMNJIdcyfaUo-KVo_h8BhmARzC-du4T1a2fIa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2SbOLmEUTVlsLYBqQbuhrUVUjcYBVU-2X1m7C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1NYur_dJUVxCvlea9Pum6EKADnPRTVvQ01kCS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUqnOG7CExPitxCu9yQNO4ZotveL1qSSA31AGo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTizogIXdcwVU4yXZS5859-ayyCev_GN2aPVXJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJrQMOxqeIcQgtH9PfUg-BdwTRBHWLbAeump3P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjeuQadYCR_wO30dCRyfUtXn2rhhPXC1QNLn7L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx6KEY6dmIhOEhMXQnVHxioE7jr2qxvEQr0k0S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808580f906ca52cf:0x5521244fd35eda15</GmapID></record>

<review>Our ferry ride to the Alcatraz Island from Pier 33 was fun with gorgeous views of the city of San Fran. Upon landing, you get an instant feeling of an old desolate place, eerie, wet and cold in California December weather, and seemingly distant. The guided tour was amazingly informative, as we walked through maze of buildings, narrow corridors with dim lights and tiny cramped prisoner cells with lots and lots of metal gates and barriers, many showing their age with rust, peeling paint off the walls. The most interesting parts were the harrowing tales of wardens, prisoners and guards, hardships so many endured, and attempted escapes and more. The kitchen was scary as you look at the cutting knives and skirmishes that would breakout in that common space. The premises are well-preserved, and you get a good sense of “what it might have been -scary, lonely, and condemned.”< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Great experience. Lovely trip over to the island. Make sure you book well in advance, there's absolutely no chance of turning up on the day and getting on a tour.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>What a great tour. The whole program is very well organized and the communication was great. We absolutely LOVED the audio tour. It has a wild 3D sound to it. Lots of cool background whistles and people which makes it feel alive. Also, they send different groups down different areas which helps spread the people out. The recreation yard was extremely cool. We went out there after the tour and took a few pictures. View of the Golden Gate Bridge from there was amazing!<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

<Text>They are great about a getting you there and back. However not too good at keeping the sign for "now loading" on track. We made it but had to ask to see if they were taking our time yet, then they realized the sign was behind. But great service. Only one that can land at Alcatraz. Make sure you book ahead of time and only through them!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5-K3mfWcM3TnY1kRMPEHfXUHhAfIZteqEvfFH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuANVpDalIQNiIliOEv2HFLjIDVWyZfs0KyzDq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDl6Cd0nMOj45EXJ8LZvmi31_Sa3USut_l2ThJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJiDRex7lJr5ZDLyYFXoGPja8W2pFbDVFNmynw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<Date>1552387357203</Date><Review>We went the day after Christmas it was packed. Thank goodness we had purchased our tickets well in advance but the wait in the line was all worth it once we got to the island. This is a must see if you’re in the area just make sure that you plan ahead as it’s very busy.<//Review><UserId.>100568606990054854598</UserId.>< resp>

The part of the pier where you can buy tickets and depart for Alcatraz. Clear signage. Easy to board ship. Book ahead if coming during peak months. Nearby exhibits explain a bit about the island.<//text>

I had a great time.  I was happy to see that there was a food counter at the ticket office and they also sold all types of Alcatraz memorabilia.  When I arrived, I took a tour of the island and walked around for awhile.  I finally got tired and took the boat back to the pier.</review>

Awesome place to visit as the weekend getaway. You can book a cruise to Alcatraz island , it hardly takes 20-25 mins to be there. Alcatraz island was the home to prisoners till 1963.

<review>Alcatraz was a lovely experience. We loved taking the boat over to the island and watching the city behind us. The included audio tour was the best part of the trip. The history of the island is so intriguing that you just want to keep listening to more.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Take the earliest ferry you can.  Alcatrez gets crowded fast.  The tour should be on your bucket list but one visit is all you need.  Make sure to get the audio tour.</Text>

Nice and easy to navigate. If you arrive a bit earlier, you might be allowed to take another boat depending on the number of attendees.

Staff is helpful and kind. Boat is clean. Foods and drinks are provided (don’t expect anything fancy though).<//Review>

5000 people a day go to the island. The should have a better area for the people waiting to go over. Show up 30mins early they say. So you can buy the $4 soda or the $5 coffee.  The island and tour is great.< /text>

< Review>
Audio tour is an absolute must! Only reason for not giving 5 stars is simply because of the infestation of flies all over their docks and mainly their boats. Everyone was complaining about them. You would easily have 5-6 crawling on you at any time. They should be able to kill most of them off their boats at a minimum.<//Review>

We were lucky to find tickets 2 days prior to our visit. Tickets are sold out vey fast, so it's better to buy them online in advance. I highly recommend to visit Alcatraz, it's a very interesting place with a lot of history. The tour offered is very good organized and full of detail.< /text>

< review>
Great trip to see alcatraz. It was very easy to get in and out and all of the tour staff were helpful. You've got to book pretty far in advance, so make sure you book as soon as you're able to. Very easy to find, it's right off of the main street by all of the other piers.< /review>

< review>
Our tour was well organized and ran smoothly. Bought our tickets online so uncharged another $25-$30 to do this. Ferry runs every half hour. The self-guided tour was great. So interesting...I had forgotten about the Indian settlement. Wear comfortable shoes...lots of walking up and down the site.<//review>

Great area and great views but the smell. Don't go to toilet before you get on boat it's not a great area. The amount of people that visit you would think they might put some new and clean toilets in.<//Text>

<Text>Buy your tickets online in advance! We made the mistake of showing up and luckily got a ticket for the next day, but apparently that was sheer luck. I would expect to get there at least 30 minutes before your departure time. The ferry is pleasant, very clean and offers a souvenir photo. We bought one for $20 with a frame. The island itself is interesting. They offer an audio tour that does an awesome job. You can even go into the first floor cells. We did do research prior to going in order to have a better understanding. Overall good tour and modestly priced. I would ride the trolley there or Uber cause parking is 30+.<//Text>< Pics>

We did the night tour of Alcatraz which was fantastic. The guides are all very knowledgable and passionate about the island. The audio guide sets the scene remarkably well and makes the entire experience very eery. Views over San Francisco at dusk are stunning.

Take warm clothes as it’s freezing in the middle of the bay, even on a warm day.</text>

You have to book 6 weeks out in order to get tickets (unless it’s slow). Make sure you buy tickets from the official site as there are websites that add huge fees! We took our whole family and had a great time. They are very accommodating for guests with wheelchairs, but there are a few places on the island you can’t get to. There is a snack bar on the boats where you can get hotdogs, drinks and alcohol.<//Review>

Just a waiting spot for a ride to Alcatraz.  It was nice they offered a few shaded spots and the cafe for drinks if you need it. If it had a charging station for travelers,  it would be great. Nothing like planning a day at the pier but having a dead phone.The ferry ride was nice, and sitting on the top deck gave some decent views. I didn't vist the snack bar, but they did have a bunch of food to eat. I bought my tickets online, and reccomend it.</text>

If you are into legend and attracted to the life of Alcapone and such then Alcatraz must be on your list.
We started from Pier 33 with Hornblower cruise to Alcatraz.it took 15 minutes to reach Alcatraz. There you can take some options to explore the island:
1. Join a free guided tour with a ranger. They normally welcome visitors at the pier of Alcatraz Island. Do not forget to tip the guide, plz. :)
2. Take a tour with free audio guide and follow every instruction and listen every detail from the audio guide. Start the audio tour at the main building (prison area). Do not forget to return the audio guide at the end of the audio tour.
3. Free and easy.

If you have 2,5 -3 hours to spend then take the free guided tour. If you have between 1,5 to 2 hours  I suggest you take the audio tour.
If you have less that 1,5 hours better go free and easy explore yourself.
btw, the cruise transfers visitor every 30-40 minutes.
we were lucky coz when we were there at the end of the tour at the book & souvenir shop, there was a lady sitting in the middle of the book store. Her name is Jolene Babyak. She's a living witness of Alcatraz during its active period and she's the author of Breaking The Rock. She told us a very interesting story regarding life of alcatraz and its people.</review>

< Review>
Tour of Alcatraz Island. Make sure that you book ahead as on the day you may not be able to get tickets.  If you have a QR code go directly to the boarding area. Great day out with audio tour in multiple languages.  Great views of both bridges and SF as long as there is no fog. Take a sweater with you as even on a good day it can get cold. Last thing , bring food or buy sandwiches on the boat over. No food for sale on the island.<//Review>

Wow! Just wow! If you haven't done this before you NEED to! Not even with a tour guide and spend the 5 hours, a self guided tour with headsets are free and just as worth it. Neat piece of history!</Text>

The place is reasonably well managed. There are unisex toilets and accessible toilets. There's a lot of lining up and waiting. The staff are efficient and reasonably friendly.< /Review>

This place was awesome I loved this place. The island was such an awesome experience. There was so much history and cool stuff. My favorite part was the audio tour, it was so cool its told you all about the place and what happened. The only bad thing was getting tickets if your interested you should do some reading about how to get tickets, overall I totally recomend it</Review>

Yup, an essential part of any SF Vacay. You won't be sad you missed it if you don't go, but if you go, woah, you'll be sooooo glad you didn't miss it. So go and be happy!< /review>

Well run and orderly (and only way) to get to Alcatraz Island. Here's my advice, plan well in advance and buy the earliest tickets.  Take a jacket any time of year as it's colder there than in San Francisco.  And line up early, as soon as you can line up to board go for it.  The lines just to get on the ship get long.< /Review>

Alcatraz itself was great.

There are many other companies to go with - choose any other one.
Inflexible tickets and uncaring staff.
Nothing about fixed times being allocated on the tour description or confirmation on Viatour.< /text>

<Review>Alcatraz is amazing. The audio tour is a must and by far the coolest thing to do in San Francisco. If you can do the Angel island then Alcatraz package it is worth it and makes a perfect full day. Make sure to plan for wind and chilly even if it is supposed to be sunny.< /Review></record>

Get there very early, and "pre-buy your tickets online."
It's supposed to get you at the front of the queue and first on the boat, unless their computer systems crash (like on the day I visited) and they hand you a hand-scribbled ticket, and You have to line up like everyone else for an hour..... But still, it was a great journey and a pretty easy process considering how freakin' busy it was.<//Review>

Not sure why I paid $125+ for tickets to go to the night tour of Alcatraz as the guard at the entrance to the ferry didn't ask to see my tickets, nor did anyone else. My mom, I and my friend all got on board and did the tour without ever once being asked for our tickets.</review>

Fabulous. Whitney, the young lady in the audio tour section, took care of us as if she knew us, helping my husband, who moves slowly, and I to the proper areas. Thanx again Whitney! Alcatraz was great.</text>

<text>Really nice, clean
Only problem was the confusion with where to line up for your time to board. There was noone directing anyone to get you on the boat at the right time. We got one line, only to find out we were on a later departure and our scheduled boat loaded without anyone announcing that departure</text>< Time>

Really great tour but def book in advance!!!
We went on the night time tour and it was great and the talks after were epic.
Advice...bring a jacket....it gets cold.
The tea was cheap on the boat though...couple of bucks.

This cruise was amazing. If you are coming to San Francisco, seeing Alcatraz is definitely worth having to book months ahead of time. Being on the island is an unreal experience. All of the parks employees on the island are super knowledgable and very friendly. We did the night tour and I would highly recommend that because there are less people, and being there at dusk really adds to the ambiance.< /review>

Historically significant. Beautiful views.  Moderately easy to navigate the spaces. There is transportation and wheel chair accessible areas.  Do the behind the scenes tour for a more intimate experience. The location is the fomer prison setting for Bird Man of Alcatraz.
Ferry from San Francisco to the island is $$ but worth it.< /Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>The hour-long Alcatraz audio tour was SO good and definitely worth the trip. I brought my own headphones and the staff let me use them with their audio device, which was a plus. The audio device was easy to control and it provided a step-by-step tour that guides you easily and correctly throughout the prison. There were a lot of people attending (we did the 9:30 am tour), but it was still easy to walk through the prison and look at everything. It's a bit of a walk up to the prison, but it has nice views and no stairs. My only complaint is the flies. They weren't in the prison or further into the island, but on the boat ride to and from the island and while you're standing at the dock to board, they are literally EVERYWHERE. I read online that they're the worst in September and October, so maybe it was just that. But even on the boat, they just covered the walls, the windows and will land all over you. A ton of people around us were complaining about them, swatting them away and getting up to try and escape them. One lady even had several stuck in her hair. And it's not just in the boat, they're even bad outside out of the boat while it's moving. The fly infestation is why I docked my review a star. It was just disgusting.< /Review>< Rate>

This was fun. I enjoyed the audio tours and the historical sites. The ferry ride was shorter than I imagined, but was lots of fun. It's too bad they didn't allow any food on the island.<//Text>

<text>Really nice, clean
Only problem was the confusion with where to line up for your time to board. There was noone directing anyone to get you on the boat at the right time. We got one line, only to find out we were on a later departure and our scheduled boat loaded without anyone announcing that departure< /text>< gmap_id>

<text>38.35$ to visit Alcatraz Island, but gas for the boat is not cheap, plus 25$ parking beside at Pier 29.5, if you're ok with walking to pier 19 it's 20$, i arrived at 9am and i was good till 9pm, winter price and during the week of course.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfc1QVK2N6IRUlKHMky2mWBs-b99fJzuQkCgQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Not sure why I paid $125+ for tickets to go to the night tour of Alcatraz as the guard at the entrance to the ferry didn't ask to see my tickets, nor did anyone else. My mom, I and my friend all got on board and did the tour without ever once being asked for our tickets.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This cruise was amazing. If you are coming to San Francisco, seeing Alcatraz is definitely worth having to book months ahead of time. Being on the island is an unreal experience. All of the parks employees on the island are super knowledgable and very friendly. We did the night tour and I would highly recommend that because there are less people, and being there at dusk really adds to the ambiance.<//review>

<text>Historically significant. Beautiful views.  Moderately easy to navigate the spaces. There is transportation and wheel chair accessible areas.  Do the behind the scenes tour for a more intimate experience. The location is the fomer prison setting for Bird Man of Alcatraz.
Ferry from San Francisco to the island is $$ but worth it.</text>< username>

The loading process for the boat to Alcatraz is well organized, and the folks at the ticket booth are very helpful.  Make sure you book your tickets online several weeks in advance as the number is limited and they sell out VERY early.  And be aware this is the only company that can actually drop you off on Alcatraz.  Other companies just circle the island and don't actually dock for tours of the prison.  This boat ride is about 15 minutes.  There are bathrooms and a snack bar onboard.<//Text>

If you're not into history don't go, the things to look at aren't that great.
If you are, go! It was very interesting to listen to the audio tour guide and learn about the history of the prison and island. There was also a short, free walking tour at our early morning arrival who was friendly and had many interesting anecdotes.</Text>

Alcatraz is a very unique tour, when you return to San Francisco consider a Quick and Convenient pedicab ride from those local wash outs. It will help transition you back to society and you will be Surprised at how affordable SF pedicab rates ARE!!!
#Fisherman's Wharf #FerryTerminal #MUNI

Forget about a Lyft or Uber and experience SF With a LOCAL!!!!!!< /Review>

They need to cover more of their waiting line area or at least move the crowd into the shaded part faster. It was blazing hot and I have 3 small children. They did load the boat rather quickly once it was time and the ride was quick and pleasant.< /Review>

It is an amazing experience. Beside the history of the building, it is Pretty well organized. The audio tour (which it is included in your ticket) is excellent. We spent almost 3 hours on the island</text>

Alcatraz was amazing.  Touring the island and the prison was interesting and educational.  We did the tour at night and one of the special tours.  Our guide and ranger were informative and were able to answer questions quickly.< /review>

This is your point of debarkation for Alcatraz island! The cafe is great and the guys running the ferry operation are organized and efficient.
They'll get you to the island and back again as smoothly as possible.<//Review>

It was a fun experience. If you haven't gone check it out. At least once. Ride on boat is short (trust me, I am not good on boats but this I can do). Just take a sea sickness pill or two. The boarding process was very good. We waited for only a bit.< /Text>

<review>The history of this place was very interesting.  The audio tour was my favorite part. My biggest complaint is the lack of drinking water and the flies. They were gross.  If you're planning to go, and I'd highly recommend you do, bring water with you.</review>< user_id>

The tour was great, Alcatraz was as impressive as everyone has led to believe. 5/5 stars for Alcatraz Island. The two stars is because of the terrible cafe. I made the mistake of ordering a bite to eat before the ferry ride. It was bland, greasy, and overpriced. $22 for a barely palatable panini, a small coffee from a thermos, and a 32oz bottle of water. Avoid.< /Text>

The boat ride was great. Tour was awesome, we liked roaming around on our own and got epic pictures.  Just didn't expect the miserable record breaking temperature and getting swarmed by flies. This isn't anybodys fault but we just couldn't stay out there any longer.</Review>

Nice safe cruise, very good with assistance for handicap people.  Loved seeing this "monument" and not overpriced on souvenirs.  Like Times Square and Broadway. Felt sorry about the size of cells for the inmates.<//Review>

<review>Pretty easy to access. They run two different tours and only one of them docks at Alcatraz; the other circles the island and then goes under the Golden Gate bridge. The tour that docks at Alcatraz was sold out and the next available one was a whole month out, so if you want to tour the prison itself book in advance. The Bay tour was an hour long and quite enjoyable. Bring a light jacket if you plan on being on the top deck. The pre-recorded tour narration was too quiet to hear well. We encountered a whale and saw sea lions which was a bonus.<//review>< GmapID>

<Text>As we left to visit Alcatraz there was a medical emergency so we ended up back to the dock and had to cut our trip short. I was really prepared to not be happy. But it was ended when we received a text saying our trip had been refunded. Wow what excellent customer service. Also didn't know there was a tram for the disabled, was pleasantly surprised. Thank you for a wonderful time</Text>< GmapID>

a must do if you go to San Francisco but i wasnt blown away with the tour.
firstly the boat trip was fine just 10-15 minutes Dock to Dock, loading on was pretty quick and efficient.
the pre-tour with the sheriff of the island was informative although a little boring.
the Audio tour voiced by old prison officers was excellently executed.
well worth doing but i wouldn't do it again.
i was a solo traveler on this excursion.< /review>

The ticket said you should be here 30 before departure, but actually if you arrive as mentioned, you simple queue up here only, so arrive 5 mins early is well enough, you will sure can on broad, but maybe no seat on the ferry only.
The ferry cost you $37.25 per person if you buy online</Text>< Pictures>

Very interesting. Worth waiting for the night tour as there is less people as the night goes on. Make sure to buy your tickets weeks or months in advance. It gets tricky when you try getting tickets at the last minute.</review>

It is what it is. Bathroom was clean on the vessel. They have coffee, nachos, and pretzels for sale on board. It's only a 15 minute ride to Alcatraz but if the weather is nice you'll be blessed by a beautiful view of the city.< /Review>

Definitely one of San Francisco's highlights and a must see for all. Absolute perfections from the tour guides to the island itself. I would highly recommend the night tour as it enhances the experience and is well worth the extra dollars. It should be noted that the extended tour is incorporated into the night tour and includes sites that are restricted to the regular tours.<//review>

Awesome Place! Make sure you order tickets in advance.  They sell out fast and you can't show up expecting to get tickets and see the island the same day. We showed up on a Thursday and they were sold out till Monday. We were unable to go to the island during our stay.< /text>

Very interesting place you definitely should visit it when visiting San Francisco. Audio tour is getting pretty boring after 10 minutes. I would suggest to walk around, read boards  at look at the pictures by yourself.< /Text>

<Text>We had a great time overall here. If you get the chance to come here, BUY YOUR TICKETS EARLY. It's also best to order through the official site as well. When we got there, I overheard what the ticket prices were for the day we went and it went up around $15-$20.
Luckily though, we bought our tickets early. When your in line waiting for the cruise, they take a picture of you and whoever you want with the Alcatraz background for a fee at the end of the tour. Make sure you also don't carry anything bigger than a regular size backpack either or else you can't take it with you.
Once you get to the island, prepare to walk quite a bit (a lot of places are uphill, then on the way back, downhill). They do offer assistance for handicapped people as well. I was quite surprised about how they let you spend all day there if you choose to. Once you get on the island, you look at the ferry times and coordinate when you want to go back. I applaud them for letting you get the most for your money. The whole thing probably takes at least one hour and can go to about three hours.
Once your ready to leave, be prepared for the waiting game. Once the ferry comes, they let all the passengers off which takes about 20ish minutes, then slowly everyone starts to get on. Then, we you get back on shore back to San Francisco, you follow the exit signs and find the picture you first took when you were standing in line to go.
One last interesting thing to note, either while your waiting for your ferry time or after you finish (preferably see this after you finish), there is a mini replica of what Alcatraz used to look like in its hay day. Furthermore, on the ground there is a giant compass highlighting the hot spots of the city.<//Text><name>Rafael Rodriguez</name>< resp>

Great range of fresh produce and good prices by San Francisco standards. Helpful staff too for finding out of the ordinary ingredients like Coleman's English Mustard.< /Text>

Alcatraz is a great tourist spot. Interesting history behind this place and not super crowded. It was freezing and rainy when I went, but I still enjoyed the trip.</Text>

Very crowded and overpriced everything with fairly low quality catering to the hardcore tourist crowd.  Only recommended for the tour if you really want to see a rundown island and prison that's falling apart.</Text>

Easy. Has store, restaurant, bathrooms and short mockups explaining all about Alcatraz. Buy online that's easy. Change there for full CityPass. All info in their site and special at CityPass site.</Text>

This was fascinating and well organised. I certainly would recommend using this business. The only negative was the queuing but well worth it. I learnt heaps</Review>

<review>Absolutely out  of this world $37 (pre booked) what a tour a must C 4 me that includes a talk from a staff member + your guided radio tour.
Book the open ticket as if U want 2 take it all in its 3.5-4hrs.
If your driving go on the parking app (google) it will show U all the cheap parking in walking distance of the pier ( some of them u need an american phone number 2 receive a text).
1 place right opposite the bus depot  $25 all day no pre booking required on pier 33 5 mins walk.
Buy your own water b4u set out as its $3.25 by the pier $2.50 on the ferry a small btle.
Take a light jumper coat if going in the day heavier clothing in the evening after sunset as the temp drops significantly< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>38.35$ to visit Alcatraz Island, but gas for the boat is not cheap, plus 25$ parking beside at Pier 29.5, if you're ok with walking to pier 19 it's 20$, i arrived at 9am and i was good till 9pm, winter price and during the week of course.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfc1QVK2N6IRUlKHMky2mWBs-b99fJzuQkCgQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

You can book online an skip some queues. Very well organized and the visit to the prison really makes you feel how painful was the life in that island.< /review>

Only reason I passed by this place is because it is the departure point for Alcatraz tours. They have toilets, that's the highlight for this place.
Of course they have a photographer on the line towards Alcatraz so they can try to sell you an overpriced picture later.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very nice trip and you should join the tour to get all the information. Best in the morning when it's still nice and empty. You can stay as long as you want and easily take back one of the boats that arrive. It is also very nice to look at everything alone because it is very spacious.
The tour through the cells should be done with the audio tour, which is now also possible in German.

(Original)
Sehr schöner Ausflug und man sollte die Führung mitmachen um alle Informationen zu bekommen. Am besten gleich am Morgen mit es noch schön leer ist. Man kann dann so lange bleiben wie man will und ganz unkompliziert eines der Boote die ankommen zurück nehmen. Man dort auch sehr schön alleine sich alles angucken da es sehr weitläufig ist.
Die Tour durch die Zellen sollte man mit der Audio Führung machen, geht auch in Deutsch inzwischen.</Text>

(Translated by Google) If you are in San Francisco, you have to look at it. You get headphones in your language and then you can start the tour. Very interesting and also very, very well told, with original sound cuts.

(Translated by Google) Join the Alcatraz Day tour. There are benches and displays such as a simple toilet, a cafe, and an island model in the Ferry platform, which can kill the waiting time. The ticket office handled all the Tour Tickets, but the day tickets were none. We recommend on-line reservation in advance. As you start lining up about 30 minutes before the departure time of your purchased Ferry, you have time to spare. Next time I would like to make a reservation early and join the night tour.

AlcatrazのDay tourに参加。Ferry乗り場には簡易トイレ、Cafe、島の模型などの展示やベンチがあり、待ち時間を潰せます。Ticket売り場では全てのTour Ticketを取り扱っていましたが、当日券はなしとのことでした。事前にon-line予約がおススメ。自分の購入したFerryの出港時間30分ほど前には並び始めるので、時間に余裕を持って。次回は早めに予約を行なってNight tour に参加したいです。<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Highly recommended !!!
It's money !!!
Once on the island, you can see the panoramic view of San from the sea. When you arrive at the island and take a picture, you go inside the prison and hang the body of a headset and a phone to make an audio tour. This is all in Korean! I watched over an hour, but I didn't know it was going.
Ah!!!! On Sunday morning at 9:10, I went to the island and watched slowly, climbed up to receive the headset, watch it and return it. Please note!

(Original)
강추!!!
돈값한다!!!
일단 섬으로 배타고 가면서 바다에서보는 샌프란의 전경을 볼수있다. 그리고 섬에 도착해 사진 찍으며 올라가면 교도소 내부로 들어가고 오디오투어를 하기위해 헤드셋과 폰만한 본체를 목에거는데 이게 한국어로 모든내용이 다 나온다!!!! 한시간여 보게되는데 시간가는줄 몰랐다.
아!!!! 일요일 아침 9시10분 배타고 섬에들어가 천천히 구경하며 올라가 헤드셋을받고 잼나게 구경하고 반납하려보니 오디오셋을 받으려는 대기줄이 어마어마했다!!  참고하시라!!!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Boarding area to take the ferry to Alcatraz, is located at Pier 33 (pier 33), there is a cafeteria and some stalls to buy food and drink since the queues can be very long, but if you go with your reservation do not you have to wait, just stand in line for your boat. The cafeteria coffee seemed very good to me, although everything you have you have to finish before boarding, since although inside the ship they sell you everything, the shipment of food and drink is not allowed.

(Original)
Zona de embarco para tomar el ferry hacia Alcatraz, esta situado en el Pier 33 (muelle 33), hay una cafetería y algunos puestecitos para comprar comida y bebida ya que las colas pueden llegar a ser muy largas, pero si vas con tu reserva no tienes que esperar, solamente hacer la fila de tu barco. El cafe de la cafetería me pareció muy bueno, aunque todo lo que tengas tienes que terminartelo antes de embarcar, ya que aunque dentro del barco te venden de todo, no se permite el embarco de comida y bebida.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The visit to the old prison fortress of Acatraz is absolutely not to be missed. Aside from the history of the place, magnificently told by a truly engaging and well-made audio guide, from the "rock" you can enjoy a UNIQUE panorama of the city. Worth every $ spent, book well in advance.

(Translated by Google) As always, full at all hours.

In the kiosk they usually have a sign that says that there is no place for that day and that they are 'oversold', but the truth is that if you line up to buy tickets they usually have for the same day or for the following days, although few places And at certain times.

I recommend you not to get discouraged if there seems to be no place, try and enjoy this experience that is extraordinary.

<rating>1< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) We were there two days before to inquire about a tour to Alcatraz. We would be well advised because of the prices. Several points were very disturbing and the service was poor.

Firstly, the much publicized "Beautyful America" ​​card, which grants access to every national park and national park, does nothing. You could actually go to the island but the ferry cost just 40 dollars and it would just be the entrance and the guide with it. This flaw is still acceptable.

Much heavier that we were not warned to buy the tickets immediately. So we stood Monday morning at the cash register and were sent away, the next possibility from the afternoon of the following day. Very annoying, especially because you can buy in front of the pier at the local "Welcome and Attraction" center black market for $ 80.

Extremely insufficient and a bad conclusive impression of SFO and the USA.

(Original)
Wir waren zwei Tage vorher dort um uns nach einer Tour nach Alcatraz zu erkundigen. Wir würden wegen den Preisen gut beraten. Mehrere Punkte waren sehr verstörend und vom Service her mangelhaft.

Erstens bringt die viel beworbene „Beautyful America“- Karte, welche einem Zugang zu jedem Bundes- und Nationalpark gewährt, nichts. Man könne zwar eigentlich auf die Insel aber die Fähre koste halt 40 Dollar und darin wäre halt der Eintritt und der Guide mit drin. Dieser Makel ist noch akzeptabel.

Viel schwerer wiegt, dass wir nicht vorgewarnt wurden die Karten sofort zu kaufen. So standen wir Montagvormittag an der Kasse und wurden weggeschickt, nächste Möglichkeit ab Nachmittag des Folgetages. Sehr ärgerlich, insbesondere weil man vor dem Pier am hiesigen „Welcome and Attraction“-Center Schwarzmarktkarten für 80 Dollar kaufen kann.

Extrem ungenügend und ein schlechter abschließender Eindruck von SFO und der USA.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The tour to Alcatraz is very interesting, definitely worth it. From the negative - it seems that the company is engaged in some sort of ticket manipulation. For example, on Saturday we looked at the availability of tickets through the official website - on Sunday there were none, on Monday it was about 150 (at different times). Then, on Saturday evening, tickets for Sunday suddenly appear (about 20 pieces) and there are still tickets for Monday (about 140 in total). Sunday morning - no tickets for Monday! Those. supposedly during the night all tickets were sold out, although for the whole previous day a maximum of 10 were bought. Next, it takes half a day on Sunday, and 3 tickets for sale on Monday appear! They did not begin to follow further, but it was very similar to some fraud with tickets.

(Original)
Экскурсия на Алькатрас очень интересна, однозначно того стоит. Из негативного - похоже, компания занимается какими-то манипуляциями с билетами. К примеру, в субботу мы смотрели наличие билетов через официальный сайт - на воскресенье не было ни одного, на понедельник было около 150 (на разное время). Далее, в субботу вечером вдруг появляются билеты на воскресенье (около 20 штук) и по-прежнему есть билеты на понедельник (около 140 в сумме). В воскресенье утром - нет ни одного билета на понедельник! Т.е. якобы за ночь все билеты были раскуплены, хотя за весь предыдущий день максимум 10 было куплено. Далее, проходит полдня воскресенья, и в продаже появляются 3 билета на понедельник! Далее следить уже не стали, но очень похоже на какие-то махинации с билетами.</Text>

(Translated by Google) One last. A unique experience. The audioguide is very well done. It guides you through the interior of the penitentiary and puts you on paper. Very well explained. It is very worth it.

(Translated by Google) An economic alternative to "pass the disgust" of not getting a ticket to make the excursion to Alcatraz
A 30-minute tour, for $ 15, ..... basic, and irrelevant.
If you do not hire him, you did not lose anything, and if you do, you can bring "good photos" of what you could not do !!!!
Look how alternative to spend 30 minutes, just that, nothing more!
Of course, the safe boat does not move, and the captain / guide / sailor (all together in one) very nice and attentive!

Fíjate cómo alternativa de pasar 30 minutos, solo eso, nada más!!
Eso sí, la lancha segura, no se mueve, y el capitán/guía/marinero (todo junto en uno) muy agradable y atento!!</Review>

(Translated by Google) Café, toilet and departure to Alcatraz, there is no need to rush to stand in line if you do not care where you end up on the ferry. If you would like to have a picture taken before departure (which can then be purchased when you return), then do not be late into the queue.

(Original)
Café, toilet og afgang til Alcatraz, der er ingen grund til at skynde sig til at stå i kø, hvis man er ligeglad med hvor man ender ombord på færgen. Hvis man gerne vil have taget et billede før afgang (der så kan købes når man kommer tilbage), så skal man dog ikke for sent ind i køen.</Text>
