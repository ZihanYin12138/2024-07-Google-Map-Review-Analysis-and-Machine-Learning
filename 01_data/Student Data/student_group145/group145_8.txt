I drive to this location which is a bit further than other Domino's location because they make their pizza better (more toppings, perfect baking of crust, just the right amount of sauce, etc.) plus their team members have awesome personalities and that's what really makes a huge difference to me.  They greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave.  Great job guys!!</Text>

Their pizza is too salty.... I love Domino’s pizza so I ordered their pizza whenever I go. I felt like they poured salt all around my pizza on purpose or something . I am so disappointed.... I will never order domino’s pizza at Redlands.< /Text>

<review>If ordering online isn't convenient enough Domino's Pizza on Colton ave has made it even easier you'll have to go online yourself to see what I mean, they have online coupons and deals to offer.

"Deal breaker"

They bring the food to your car you don't even have to get off all they ask is that when you get there push the on-screen I'm here button turn on your hazard lights and within 5 minutes they have your pizza your chicken wings ready in hand that was pretty cool and the hot chicken wings and pizza as always AMAZiNG!< /review>< rating>

Literally there was no hamburger meat, only  tiny tiny little pieces maybe one or two pieces on each slice..It tasted good but it didn’t taste like cheeseburger , it tasted like cheese pizza! So we paid $15.99 for cheese pizza with tomatoes and a hint of onion.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Since the out break COVID 19, we have more than ever ordered delivery. We have used multiple places and the only delivery so far that has not had any hiccups has been Domino's. Delivered on time,  and the orders done correctly. As for the food itself, we have done the gambit  of pizza, sandwiches, pasta, desserts and salads. They do well in prep but it is a matter of personal taste how much likes or dislikes any food order. We find Domino's to be simply a nice break from fast food and like the fact we can count on them.</review>< pics>

They made my order wrong and didn’t tell me when I was standing in the lobby. I then asked if I could get curbside delivery because I didn’t fill like waiting in the lobby with customers coming in out. They said yes but of course I had to walk back in again and get my pizzas. It was supposed to done by the latest 9:37pm but I didn’t get my pizzas until 10:17pm</text>

<Text>Yesterday I ordered 15 pizzas for delivery to feed my team here at Toyota of Redlands. I knew it was a big order and expected to wait at least an hour because it was lunch time. Nope, about 37 min later (I checked) a little white scion pulled up to our dealership and the delivery man popped out with his Domino’s hat on! He carried them to the lunch room for me and when I complimented the time of delivery, he said said with some pride “ we have a great team!” I was blown away and it’s why I’m writing this lengthy review. Here at Toyota of Redlands our principals are Teamwork, Commitment, and integrity; and that’s what I saw with Domino’s yesterday! Great job team, and THANK YOU!< /Text>< pics>

Purchased cheese bread and medium pepperoni and sausage pizza and shared it with three people.
PROS: hot and steamy, good value, decent amount of toppings, warm and cheesy garlic bread. Friendly service.
CONS: Mid quality ingredients, sauce is too acidic, crust tastes slightly frozen and over buttered/oiled.</Text>< pictures>

When i went to pick up my order.  The guy working on Saturday afternoon was kinda rude. When i got home the pizzas barely had any cheese. It was topping on sauce. My son was upset because only 1 piece of bacon & chicken was over cooked. Since they moved location there service & food has gone down the drain.

This is second time happen. I tried to call the store on Saturday was hung up twice..  They really need to get together or new fancy building will end up empty if keep serving food like this. Even complained to corporate with nothing happening..</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I Ordered to go, while waiting spoke w/staff at counter they didn't know how to use points and other perks. Maybe in training.? Waited nearly 30min. where's my pizza's? They had been ready and just sitting there, & the staff that took my order didn't know. OMG. This had been the 1st Domino's I've seen where you can sit down and eat your pizza,  and it was clean.< /Review></record>

I don’t care what people say, I love Dominos for the ease of transactions, the consistent taste, there’s never any surprises. The folks behind the counter are real too.<//review>

<text>Their customer service is terrible and they always mess up your order. Was charged for an order and then when called they said they never got the order even though my card was charged. Wouldn’t do anything about besides tell me I had to call my bank to fix their mistake.

<Text>Well, we were waiting for this site to get built and running but after all this time and even after the manager tells us they deliver to our address (I even dropped by the store to ask the manager if they did delivery to our address) I still can not order online and have a delivery to our address.  I can however call and pay over the phone and have a delivery made and they are nice about it but again would be nice to not have to go through all of that and give my credit card over the phone.  Not sure why a decision was made 8 years ago to close down the one on the corner of Lugonia and Wabash, you had plenty of business.  Oh Well, Papa Johns has always delivered to us and still do, much more easier on a Friday or Saturday, too bad, we were hoping for a new Dominos.</Text><gmapID>0x80dcaa6d77c25f49:0x115fce2b66734281<//gmapID><Response>None< /Response>< Pictures>

This Dominos is ridiculous I ordered a delivery and the girl seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. I have gave her our address and phone number. An hour later still nothing I called and they said the tried calling and delivering but the person said they didn't order anything. I understand things happen but they need to make sure they have someone who knows what they are doing on the phone!!!</Text>

<Review>Always fast and always friendly! I have ordered from this location for pick up quite often and at a mile and a half away, the order is always hot, ready and correct.

The only downside is the parking lot is very small for the amount of business the shopping center gets, so you usually have to park across the street. Having said that, still a great pick up location with friendly employees.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

The worst customer service I've ever experienced. First I call and they ask me for my number instead of my order first. Then didn't ask me for a name. I ordered the 2 medium deal and forgot that it had chicken with it. So I go to the store I get my pizza(pay like 21 dollars just for 2 pizzas) then the girl that was there she didn't even give me my receipt.  Then I just see them talking  to eachother like they dont have work except the guy making the pizza. Never eating there again 😡<//review>

<review>I am really disappointed. We were excited to be ordering with Domino's after years of ordering from Pizza Hut. We ordered two pepperoni pizzas with extra cheese. Both pizzas barely had any cheese on them at all, forget the "extra." We barely finished the first pizza because even the kids didn't like eating the nearly cheese-less pizza. Looks like we will be going with Pizza Hut or even Little Caesar's next time. I should have checked the boxes before we left.</review>< pics>

I'm happy they have a gluten free crust. Especially on days I'm not feeling well and just want comfort food. Their app makes it so easy to order food for delivery!</Review>

The delivery is fast and the food is good but the price is crazy. With tip it is $35 for a large pizza and 8 wings. I can get two dinners and 2 salad bars at Sizzler  for the same price. This was my last order with Dominoes.</Text>

<Review>I ordered a pizza from this dominos location and usually I don't have any problems, but this time they made the pizza wrong. I returned the pizza and they said they would re-do the pizza. But instead of making me a new pizza they simply pulled the pepperoni off my pizza and added pineapple to it. As someone who doesn't eat meat not only did this disgust me but it also made me queasy and sick feeling. I hope that in the future they're employees are not as lazy.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>oh god, so we ordered two large pizzas with ham, italian sausage, and bacon. we arrive, and it was dark, i go inside, pay for my pizzas and take them back to my car where my mom and i begin to eat them in the dark, only to realize that we've been given ham, bacon, and pineapple. i return, and they were very kind, remaking the pizzas and letting me keep the other ones for free. i go back into the car and realize i forgot to check them. this time we've been given italian sausage, bacon, and pepperoni. i go back AGAIN, finally that last time looked good, and they even gave us extra cheese as an "apology". we ate that on the way home, and it tasted fine, until we actually got home and bit across an onion. in retrospect i think they only put extra cheese to cover up the onions. i love dominos, they have great pizzas, but oh god, that was awful, and now i'm stuck with six pizzas all of which were not made correctly.<//review><userid>112660874569794116130</userid>< Date>

So you still dont deliver to our area yet your competition that is almost 2 miles further away does.  Whoever decided your delivery foot print is not a smart business person.  Done with your company.< /text>

<review>Bomb Ass Pizza and my pizza is always perfect..But the parking to that location is Horrible! I never ever find parking cause of the restaurant next to it..so I have to bring someone with me to wait in the car while I run in, that or I have to park down the street in some dirt field..they really need a better location or more parking assigned to it...</review>< Rate>

Been coming to dominos ever since they revamped their dough. Definently a bigger fan now! Staff here are always usually friendly. Pizza is always hot when it arrives. Their $5.99 deals  are always perfect to fill for 3-4 people. pick up can sometimes be annoying if the lot is filled.< /Text>

Terrible, I tried to order a pizza for a friend and they would not give it to her because the card was not present. I understand safety, but pardon if i scoff at protecting me for a 15 dollar grand heist. The policy is stupid and pointless and I will certainly be complaining.<//Review>

Horrible pizza arrived cold was not cut all the way . Pizza had air bubbles  very little toppings.  Drivers don't carry peppers is a special request according to manager wasting my time waited about 30 to 45 min for food only to take picure and threw it to the trash will talk to owner</Review>

Really good. Guacamole was fresh. Drive through was long and fast. Really great to see Del Taco opening nice locations for a change. Competent team and good food.< /review>

Not only were the tacos a lot emptier than those found at other Del Taco locations, but even when the person at the speaker got my order correct as "No Sauce", there was SAUCE on my tacos. These tacos were worthless cause I am allergic to the sauce! I recommend going to another location for tacos.</review>

Wife went through the drive thru, every single item was disgustingly old and hard. Couldn't even bite through a churro, absolutely infuriating. Old soggy nasty fries, hard tortillas, old beans, everything looks like it's been sitting for hours. Been a Del Taco fan for most of my life and this is by far the WORST fast food experience I've ever had. Tried calling to complain and nobody answers the phone. Really??< /Review>

We ordered "Del Taco's" from this new location. They were only halfway filled. When you pay extra for a "Del Taco" it should be full of meat, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on top.<//Text>

The kids who work at this location seem to be trying their best, perhaps hiring fast-food knowledgeable workers may help. My order is always the same: pollo asado bowl. There’s a good portion of rice, but VERY LITTLE BEANS! The ratio does not make any sense. Please add black beans to the pollo asado bowl 🙏🏼. I have tried ordering a side of black beans to compensate for the “missing” beans, but apparently it is not available 😖<//Review>

All fast food should let you see a menu BEFORE you have to order.  That's why they got a 4 from me.<//text><Name>Liana Clark<//Name>< Time>

<Review>Said it was open till 12. We went at 11 and noone answered the call box. We drove to the window. Noone answered the window. All of the employees were standing in the parking lot and we asked them and they said it was closed. This was Saturday night we ended up going to another location</Review><Response>None</Response>< user>

One other time I was waiting for my order to be taken with no cars in front of me at all, so I gave up after 5 minutes and left,  if you guys can get it right, why did you even open.< /Review>< pictures>

I went in side and ordered two bacon double cheeseburger. The meat patties were hard and brittle, the bacon was half a handful of bacon crumbs! The food was terrible! I live 6 blocks from this location on Plum Canyon rd . I will never get food from this company again!</Review>

Service is routinely very slow (30 minutes plus for drive thru fast food tacos?). The line is very lengthy. Orders are repeatedly wrong. Don't go to this location. I sure won't be back.<//Text>

< Review>
Went here the first week they opened and ordered chicken tacos.  Hardly had ANY chicken in em at all... second time i ordered 2 large fries.  They didn’t even put the large fries in large fry boxes.  They put them in    two burger boxes and both of them put together didn’t even equal one large fry.  People pay hard earned money to at least get the amount of food that they’re charged for, and at that it’s too expensive.  At least put the AMOUNT of food in the bag people pay their money for.  If they didn’t have enough, kool just let me know but don’t short me.  Do not eat here... Worst del taco i’ve ever been to.  Gave them several chances< /Review>

I was diagnosed with scoliosis and told by my primary medical doctor that there was probably nothing that could be done to fix it or find a long term solution, I was told to take medication for pain relief and try to focus on my posture more (not to mention I’m only 22 years old). I went into a dark place mentally and physically and of course where the mind goes, the body follows.
I am so glad that a friend of ours had a personal testimony and experience with synapse and referred me to them.
I jumped in with full faith, not knowing for sure if it would work for me, but I seen it had worked for people around me.
I am already so grateful for the pain relief they have given me. The first couple of weeks were rough, but I am now a quarter way through and I am already able to say I am completely pain free (after being in pain for over 3 years). I am mentally already happier and have more energy. I love the staff, love the quality and cleanliness of the place. Love how simple and easy it is to change appointments and reschedule things, and I love their business hours. I highly recommend Synapse.</Review>

These guys gave me my life back! I was at the point where every week my back would go out and my days were spent laying in bed or on the floor. Gave them a try and after a couple months my life is back to normal. Can play with my kids, go on walks and hang out with my dogs stress free now.</Text>

The staff is so kind and personal, and it’s guaranteed you will get relief! Plus, they can do X-rays in house and regularly use imaging to check out your progress. Love myself something data driven! Seriously such a find, highly recommend!<//Review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Is it possible to give 10 stars? I have significant back and neck injuries related to college and high school football that had become reaggravated to the point it was unbearable. I called Synapse for an emergency adjustment as a new patient and was set-up with an appointment same day which actually cut into their lunch closure hour to accommodate me. Their clinic is spotless and brand new & extremely clean. I was greeted immediately at the door and given a tour of the operations. As a new patient I received their initial consult special which included a posture analysis, temperature scan of my spine, and muscle scan along with x-rays of areas that had been of issue- all of which is done in-house! After this process, which was incredible efficient, I met with Dr. Sahota and Dr. Todd who both handled aspects of my issues and their approach to wellness plan. I then received an adjustment and within a few hours of completion I had full range of motion back in my neck with no pain for the first time in over a month and had some relief in my lower back as well. Later that evening I received a call at home checking on my status from Dr. Todd direct & this morning I got a text with a personalized detail of my follow-up appointment that is set. It is rare in this day and age to receive good service and care & generally it is only one aspect of the process. The Synapse Team is truly 10 star and did everything possible to show me my wellness mattered to them. I have made two referrals already this morning and there will be many more to follow. As a college football player at a Division 1 School I received great medical attention but this has been by far the best overall experience I have had anywhere with great results. I am excited again for the thought of a future that might include a back and neck that are pain free.</Text></record></dataset><record>

First time to a chiropractor and it has been a good experience. I really appreciate the scans and X-rays so there is a plan and not just making adjustments without that detailed information. All the staff is very nice and welcoming!</review>

Dr. Sahota does a very thorough job from testing and imaging to explaining what your problems are. He sets a clear plan on how to resolve the issue and is always willing to explain any questions you have in detail. Definitely no other office you should go to other then Synapse Chiropractic.< /Text>< user>

<Text>Dr. Sahota is amazing. He does the torque method of adjusting. If you haven’t tried this method before give it a try. Dr. Sahota answers all of my questions, I never feel rushed and he explains what he is doing. I’ve been coming to him for over a year and my back has improved from when I first started seeing him. The office staff is very friendly and always very helpful. I highly recommend this office. You won’t be disappointed.<//Text><name>Sondra Stroud<//name>< user_id>

I have been seeing Dr Sahota for the last 2.5 years and am so happy with the improvement I have made under his care. I truly encourage anyone, regardless if you have pain or not. Synapse has improved my way of life. I could not even stand up straight without feeling extreme pain when I started. Within the first couple of months I felt so much better, and am now see him bi monthly to maintain. The staff is amazing and make me feel so welcome every time I walk in the door. They are all so accommodating. Great atmosphere and music, too!!!<//text>

Great place to go I’ve been here going on 8 weeks and being a body builder and into heavy weight lifting I’ve had problems with my hips and lower back but ever since I’ve seen Dr Sahota my hip issues have gone away and I’m able to lift 2x my body weight without injury I am beyond grateful! The staff always makes you feel welcome and it’s like a big family love this place would recommend!< /text>

From the doctor to the staff, this office will not disappoint!!! The thorough explainations of reasons behind current symptoms, the treatment plans catered to your needs, and the adjustments that have me leaving feeling like a new person are just a few of the reasons I'll drive from 30 minutes away, and won't see anyone else for my chiropractic needs!! I'd give this place a 10 star review if I could!!</review>

I have been getting adjusted by Dr.Sahota for almost 2 years now and I always look forward to them. I always leave feeling well taken care of. I have little to no migraines since seeking chiropractic care and my posture has improved tremendously.

The atmosphere is always welcoming and inviting and the staff is amazing. They are all very accommodating and will work with your needs. I definitely recommend seeking care from Dr.Sahota if you are looking for the best chiropractor.< /Text>

I started care in February and at that time I was experiencing a lot of pain not just in my back but I had trouble sleeping, sitting, exercising and carrying backpacks. It is 6 months into care and I sleep very well, sit comfortably, carry backpacks with a lot less pain, and overall have less aches and pain in my back than I did 6 months ago. The synapse team is very nice and just wants me and the rest of the members to be healthy and happy! Dr. Sahota and the synapse crew makes you feel so welcomed and valued the second you step into the office!</text>

Top quality professionals, friendly ,accommodating staff, and LOVE Dr. Sahota! Every time I go in, he is able to fix the problem. From hip out  and back pain to vertigo. He is magical! And never seems to be in a rush. I have recommended several people who have used him and feel the same way!</Review>

I had tried to go to a previous chiropractor I had but after the adjustment I was still in so much pain. and All I got from him was ice and if that doesn't work come back.

I went into Dr. Sahota office and felt welcome, they took the time to talk with me and helped me understand  what was going on with my back and my treatment. On the first visit I felt so much better.  I can honestly say he cares about your health and takes the time to hear you.

< Review>
Dr. Sahota and Raman are the BEST!

I began care at Synapse Chiropractic about a year ago. At the time I was in terrible physical pain and had experienced 20 years of injuries and illnesses: a neck fusion, knee surgeries, double mastectomy, lymphodema, IBS, lasting nerve damage from meningitis, pulmonary embolisms, etc. My health was shattered. Within weeks of biweekly care, I was able to kayak and go on hiking trips again.

I follow my care program very carefully with Dr. Sahota and now, a year later I have full mobility, sleep at night without pain, and no longer experience RLS or breakthrough nerve pain. It's gone. Now, I go once a week consistently to ensure I stay in preventative mode. I am so incredibly grateful for them!

A few months ago,
I began experiencing horrible stomach problems. I worked with my PCP, gastroenterologist, and several specialists and nothing was working. I came in to Dr. Sahota and began the Trust Your Gut program. I highly recommend! Once again, Dr. Sahota was there every step of the way and I feel great now! Synapse has made a huge impact on my health. Thank you Synapse!!<//Review>

I’m feeling amazing after my 10th appointment.  Alongside, adjustments Dr. Sahota does thorough assessments by taking xrays and thermal and muscle scans and reviewing them with you and discussing the process.

Dr. Sahota is highly educated in his field & is the most compassionate and personable chiropractor I have ever worked with.

Thank you Dr. Sahota & Staff for helping me on my road to recovery!< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I have been really skeptical about going to the Chiropractor mainly because of fear, but I have had hip pain, back pain and Neck pain off and on for years, so instead of more injections I decided to give a Chiropractor a try. I chose Synapse because of the reviews and recommendations and it has changed my life literally.  No nerve pinching,  and almost all my hip, back and neck pain are gone and my treatment plan isn't even complete yet.  Thank you Synapse Team or I should say Family because that is how I feel every time I enter the doors.<//Review>

<Review>My experience here at Synapse has been great! Dr. Sahota and his staff are very professional. Everyone welcomes you with positive vibes and the facility is so clean. I have been having back pain for years and more recently was in need of some relief. I went to a couple of providers previously that were not able to adjust my back.

Discovering this place has been an incredible blessing for my healing! After struggling with unexplained health issues and feeling helpless after seeking help from traditional health care, Dr. Sahota's approach to wellness made me feel seen, heard, and truly guided to the next step of my healing process. The office staff brightens my day every time I walk in. I look forward to my appointment days because of the loving, warm and supportive atmosphere they provide!</review>

I have been to three other Chiropractors, all with varying degrees of success (old mid back injury and scarring combined with neck problems from a car accident). Dr. Sahota and the rest of the staff do a thorough examination, pay close attention to my needs, and most importantly provide treatment that is effective!< /Text>

Wow oh wow! 10/10 experience from walking through the door, to walking back out of it an hour later! Be prepared to be greeted by Raman or Ally, the sweetest receptionists and wellness staff I’ve had the pleasure of working with! They give you a grand tour of the entire facility before proceeding with anything else, and it definitely helps break the ice and just put you at ease, as well as that helps you get a feel for the staff you’re working with! They showed me every room, let me know what to expect and anticipate, an answered any questions I would have! The facility itself is a super cute office, that feels more like a very professional Airbnb due to the cute furniture and decor choices, the entire staff (including the super cute girl wearing glasses didn’t Catch her name) made everything the desired experience. $187 later I got all my xrays, all my assessments and alignments taken care of, complete report of findings, and 1 on 1 time with Dr. Ranvir Sahota to talk about day to day lives and allow him to gather his own opinions and advice on how to better care for your body and routine! Also, I’ve got my next appointment booked already before leaving so everything’s really taken care of. Head to toe treatment, I really do recommend Synapse to anyone with Chiropractic needs!< /Text>

This place is awesome! We've been coming for over 2 years now and feel and function so much better than we used to. Before coming here, I would wake up several times a week with debilitating tension headaches; I can't remember the last time I had one. Not only are Dr. Sahota's adjustments amazing, but he's extremely knowledge and is always prepared to answer any questions we have. The rest of the staff is also amazing and works hard to make us feel like family. Couldn't recommend enough!!</Text>

<Review>I love that this place Is a very fun dynamic place. They greet you when you enter and it’s not often where you see employees that are so personable with their customers. They take their times to show that they care. The chiropractic is very clean, friendly and has done a tremendous job in helping me with my back problems. I recommend this place to others.</Review></record>

Synapse Chiropractic has help the tightness in my neck and align my spine. It has been 5 months since I started my treatment and I feel much better. People have asked me if I have gotten taller. I do not think that I grew in the last 5 month. I think it is due to my treatment to have better posture.

12.10.2020 update
It has been 2 years since I started Synapse Chiropractic and one thing I noticed is that I haven't  been sick. Some days, I feel run down but when I feel that way I can just sleep it off. Before I started to Synapse, when I felt run down I would get sick. I feel this change was partly due to going to Synapse Chiropractic.</text>< user_name>

Under the care of Dr. Sahota I have experienced dramatic improvement in my well-being. Prior to begining care I was experiencing debilitating back pain. Now I am able to enjoy various strenuous activities that were beyond my abilities before.
Furthermore, the  staff are always very friendly and happy to see me whenever I am in the office.<//Review>

Synapse chiropractic is exceptional. The detail that goes into every part of this practice makes it stand apart from other chiropractors. Every team member greets you by name when you walk through the door. They engage you in conversation and discuss ways to pursue greater health. Dr. Sahota is precise and thorough, taking thoughtful care to make sure you are progressing in your plan towards health and wellness. I’ve seen tremendous relief in my time at synapse.<//review>

<Review>Synapse Chiropractic is great! Couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me forever, went to different physical therapists and treatment centers and never got results that worked. Then I came here and was fixed after my first visit! It’s great and all my questions were answered in detail to make me comfortable and knowledgeable on what I was being treated with!

For my family Synapse Chiropractics feels like a breath of fresh air - literally and figuratively. After just few sessions with doctor Sahota you'll definitely feel better and have more conscious approach to your body and posture. 100% friendly staff and relaxing environment for your body treatment. Come and try it for yourself!<//Review>

<review>Dr. Sahota has been helping me with my lower back pain.  Since seeing Dr. Sahota, my back pain has improved traumatically.  I was able to take a road trip to the midwest with no back pain!  Yah  :)

Dr. Sahota showed me why I was in pain and how we can work to eliminate and minimize any discomfort.

This has been a very positive experience for me.<//review>< Pics>

My back has had spasms on and off for as long as I can recall. My daughter insisted that I call Synapse Chiropractic and make an appointment. She visited them while she was pregnant and she insisted that they were very thorough and would explain everything to me before doing anything. I was scared to death to go but I did it. She was so right, the staff was very reassuring and made me feel comfortable. When I saw the doctor he explained everything and was gentle. A lot of my pain was relieved after the first adjustment. It was the best chiropractic experience I have ever had. I am feeling so much better each time I go and I am so glad I listened to my daughter and made an appointment.<//review>

I love Synapse Chiropractic, when I first started coming in I had terrible pain in my back and hip but as soon as I started seeing Dr. Sahota my pain completely disappeared after a few months. I’ve been coming in for a a year and honestly I’ve never felt so good in my body before. Highly recommend!<//review>

Synapse Chiropractic has genuinely changed my life. I started care back in July of 2018. I came in because I was having back spasms every day, terrible headaches, and sleeping less than 2 hours a day. After being under care even in just my first week I noticed significant changes, I was able to get sleep almost every time I sat down which was the biggest relief. I felt like a whole new person. Within my first month my back spasms were relieved and I was able to walk without being in pain again. I’ve been under care for 8 months now and I love all the new experiences while my body is on its way to meet it’s full potential. I’ve gained so much more energy and happiness through chiropractic. I fully trust the process and highly recommend going and experiencing the team at Synapse!< /Review>

Dr. Sahota and team are truly the most caring staff. I’m always welcomed with a warm smile, and I know that they have my best interests and health in mind. My girlies are ALWAYS taken care of, and when they are fighting something off I take them to Dr. Sahota. He has the magic touch to help us feel and keep feeling well. If you haven’t made it in, I highly recommend you make an appointment. Your life will be CHANGED!<//text>

As a family focused on living a holistic healthy lifestyle, Synpase chiropractic was the perfect compliment to our preventative & functional health goals. With a 2+ year old son with a host of developmental delays & challenges the continual improvement/progress we have witnessed in him is the biggest blessing.

The team is truly invested in our health, they are well informed, fun & have an inviting practice. We are so grateful to partner with Synapse Chiropractic in our pursuit of living a balanced healthy life!<//Text>

I can't tell you how amazing this office is!! Dr. Sahota is extremely passionate about chiropractic and you can tell that he loves what he does. He does an amazing job helping you understand exactly what is going on, how he can help and also why he can help. I have been under his care for a few months and he has been doing an amazing job. He has been supportive in my personal and professional life and the results I get from Neurologically based chiropractic care stand above all other care I have ever received!<//review>

I really appreciate how much time the team at Synapse Chiropractic spent assessing my current health, asking questions, and building a plan to help me address my current symptoms.  They also made sure that I was building muscle strength and working on my posture so that my body would learn good habits throughout the process.  I felt genuinely cared-for and can already see results after only a few visits! ~Christina Marlow< /text>

I wasn't sure if chiropractic would help me, as I have not had positive results from other practitioners. I am so grateful to have found Synapse. My whole life is better. I can't believe how much pain I was used to tolerating. I feel ten years younger. Thank you Synapse!<//review>

<Review>Update: a year later and I still love this place, the vibe, the care, the attention to my sore spots. Such an awesome staff

I just LOVE this office. Raman is so loving and always smiling. She brings such a bright light to the front office I love seeing her face.  Dr. Sahota is truly a gentle compassionate man. He wants to help you and make sure you get the care you need no matter how it’s done. I can’t thank them enough for helping me and so thankful I found this office. It’s not a pop and go it’s a conversation, how you doing, let’s find the root cause to the issue. Amazing, wonderful office!!<//Review>< time>

I had not even considered chiropractic care until Dr. Sahota and his wife visited my workplace. I didn’t have any major concerns but after diagnosing some problem areas and getting adjustments, I noticed a difference with my body in a short amount of time. Staff is very friendly, educational and thorough!  You are always prepared on what’s to come because they keep you informed every step of the way. Highly recommended a consultation!<//Review>

I've seen and been treated by a number of chiropractors over the past 25 years. Some very good and some not so good. None have been as thorough and engaged in treating me as this very professional team at Synapse Chiropractic. Search where you will, but make sure you give this team a proper try first.</review>

<review>My family and extended family, LOVE Synapse chiropractic.  The entire staff is supportive to our different many different ages & needs.  I drive 40 minutes after very llllooonnnngggg work days with our Veterans & their families to get my adjustments.  The workshops they had (new patient & postural), provided FANTASTIC practical & useable information - with emailed follow up information.  No doubt, the next workshop "Healthy Living & Nutrition" will be great too.  If you like/want/need a positive community/family feeling......  This is a wonderful team to assist with your healing!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Dr. Sahota and team are a wonderful resource for chiropractic care.  Synapse is a very welcoming and relaxing place to be.  The team has helped me in becoming more consciously aware of my well being during the healing process.  Dr. Sahota’s point source technique has benefited me not only in the healing process of my lower back pain but also with other problems like my posture, neck pain, and headaches. Thanks Synapse Team! Always making sure we receive the correct signals for our bodies to heal!<//Review>

Synapse is great! I have been a practice member for about 6 months now and will continue to be a practice member for the forseable future! Dr Sahota is great and has helped me both athletically and structurally in ways I didn’t know I needed! The team is always friendly and makes you feel comfortable from the moment you walk in!< /Text>

STOP!!! Look no further, you have found the chiropractor you've been searching for! My husband and I have both received so much help from Dr. Sahota and I couldn't help but share it with others. Now six other family members are getting help from Dr. Sahota too! This is no snap-crackle-and-pop adjustment, he customizes each visit to meet whatever the need is. I always leave feeling like I've just had a massage! The whole Synapse team is so cheery and kind, making you feel welcome every visit!</review>

I’ve been coming to synapse chiropractic going on three months now. I came in with compliant of constant headaches and a sciatic nerve pain. After finding out out I needed some spine correction in my upper neck area I come in for a weekly appointment although he did recommend I come in more frequent to correct it faster. I have seen and felt Major improvements in the mobility of my neck, and haven’t had a headache or sciatica pain since about my  third visit. I would highly recommend that if you are having any pains in your back neck or head even sinus problems that you at the very least come in and get a consultation. Thank you Synapse Chiropractic!< /review>

I was referred to Dr. Sahota by my personal injury lawyer. I had been to the chiropractor before, but felt like I was being ripped off and not really treated correctly. Dr. Sahota completely changed that around. His technique is different than others I have seen, but so beneficial. I have noticed a huge difference in my neck and back since going to him the past few months after my auto accident. I use to get headaches every single day. Now I get them maybe a few times a month (a lot better!) I would recommend him to anyone and everyone! Their customer service is excellent as well. Go here!!<//Text>

Dr. Sahota and his team are a friendly, professional and really make an effort to get to know each individual. This is not a "stop and pop" kind of place, meaning there's a treatment plan formulated by Dr. Sahota with your long term goals and success in mind. He takes a neurological approach and does not just work with the skeletal system (as most chiropractors seem to do), which is so important. You'll be greeted by name upon arrival, given an office tour your first visit and you'll have Dr. Sahota sit down with you to discuss your issues and goals. You'll be engaged every time you visit and you won't feel like just "another customer" at Synapse. It's too early in my journey to tell if there is improvement, but I know my back pain didn't start over night so I don't expect to be healed that quickly. I'm confident that if anyone can help me, its Dr. Sahota.<//review>

I was new to chiropractic treatment and was unsure of what to expect. I did not have any medical issues, but was lucky enough to have the opportunity to be treated by Dr. Ranvir Sahota.  He has done an excellent job of explaining the procedures and answering all of my questions. In just a few sessions of treatment I have already noticed great improvements in my day to day life. I am breathing and sleeping much better. It is amazing how much easier it is for me to fall asleep. My energy is up and my coordination and reflexes have been greatly improved. Headaches and migraines have been exceedingly reduced as well, it is like my body has been jump started into reaching its maximum potential. It has actually started to inspire me to be healthier to continue to experience further improvements in my life. Highly recommended for anyone who has never considered or unsure about Chiropractic treatment.<//text>

<Text>I have been following Synapse Chiropractic for a while on Facebook because they reminded me so much of a chiropractor I had in Texas that made huge difference in the way I felt. I injured my lower back and was able to get in and begin a treatment plan right away. Dr Sahota really wants his patients to understand what is going on with their bodies and explains everything. He's very gentle, which is great because I'm generally very nervous when someone is adjusting me. I've been to other chiropractors in the area which are good, but Dr Sahota is the only one who personalizes every single visit and tailors the adjustment to how you feel that day. The office staff is always warm and welcoming too.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Ranvir is easy to talk with and will encourage you to take positive steps for improvement.  Yet, also understands that everyone has their own pace.   Raman has great energy and is also easy to talk with.  She listens to your needs and helps with the outcome.  The environment is always happy and relaxing.  My world is changing in a great way with their help.</Review>

<Text>After my primary moved to California I searched for another Chiropractor who specialized in Applied Kinesiology. After months of searching Dr Sahota was that solution. I’ve been more than pleased with his abilities/techniques and willingness to go beyond. He’s treated several members of my family plus athletes I’ve trained. The difference was clear to everyone. We left each visit educated with tools to enhance our health & performance beyond our appointments. A service I greatly appreciated. It was sad to see him leave but I'm also very excited for his new venture in California. Thanks for everything doc!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I must be honest, I wasn't a believer in the benefits of chiropractic care until I visited Dr. Sahota. I used to get head-pounding headaches and aspirins can only do so much. Dr. Sahota explained clearly what the issue is and how he can help. Getting adjustments has helped me tremendously, and I'm a firm believer now in the power of chiropractic care!<//Text>< Pictures>

I had been having upper back/neck pain for a while and decided to visit a chiropractor after many years. I was very nervous at first but Dr. Sahota's friendly personality helped calm me. Before adjusting me, he took the time to educate me on chiropractic treatment and why it is beneficial for me. He was very patient, and involved me in the process. Dr. Sahota definitely cares about his patients so do pay him a visit! You will leave the office with more knowledge, and feel healthier.</review>

<review>My doula recommended Synapse Chiropractic to me and going in for chiropractic work during my pregnancy was one of the best things I could have done for myself and for my baby! Dr. Sahota is trained to work with pregnant women during their pregnancy and he takes the time to make sure you are comfortable and adjusted properly. I have been to so many different chiropractors, and he has been hands down the best one! I have now continued to see him after my pregnancy because I am hooked. Rumin and Cathy are seriously the sweetest people on the planet and I am always greeted and welcomed. They make going in to the office so much fun. They office is very accommodating if you have to change your appointment and the whole experience from the minute you walk in the door is positive. I am really glad I found this office and would recommend them to anyone, especially my pregnant mama friends.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Hannah Perry<//username><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

A few years ago, I injured my back by bending and twisting down abruptly (without weight or load) and could not work for a few days and would have pain and spasms for weeks.  I eventually tried massage therapy, which only offered temporary relief, before being introduced to Dr. Sahota, whom introduced me to chiropractic care.  Chiropractic care focuses on a drug-free approach along with spine manipulation, traction, and core balancing and strength training.

I would see him three times a week, where he would adjust my spine, apply traction and use other tools / machines to loosen and maintain movement in my lower back, shoulders and neck.  He would then have me perform core balance and training exercises that he would also have me practice at home.  He would educate me on the the spine and muscles as well as what good habits to practice to prevent further deterioration.

Seeing Dr. Sahota has absolutely been life-changing and I am stronger, stand up straighter, and more pain-free than I have been in years.  I encourage anyone with back pain or problems to see him as he is thorough, educational, motivational, and genuinely cares about people's back pain.  Ask him about his motivation for becoming a chiropractor and you will know why he is passionate about people's spines.  He is great doctor and professional and you will be taken care of.</Text>

I've been going to Synapse Chiropractic for about 4 months.  I'm glad I found  this office  because  I  was having  pain and stiffness on my back,  I wouldn't go to a medical doctor because they  make things things worse most of the time.  My stiffness  is gone now and still working on the other issues.  Dr. Sahota is very dedicated and  he really knows what he is doing.  His staff  Raman and Cathy are pleasant, friendly  and extremely helpful.  I also like the SKED app for scheduling appointments. My treatment at Synapse has been a wonderful  experience!< /text>

<review>Dr. Sahota and the staff at Synapse are some of the most caring individuals healthcare has to offer. Personally, I would highly recommend Synapse  Chiropractic to anyone looking for someone who cares about your individual needs and has a different approach to healing the body while getting to the root cause of the issue!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Sahota is great and very informative. For him it's not only about healing his patients but also educating them on how to avoid the aches/pains they might have. I was having back pain and he was able to help and also gave great tips and exercises that would help. I highly recommend Dr. Sahota and Synapse Chiropractic!</Text>

I highly recommend Synapse Chiropractic to the Roseville and Rocklin communities. I have been a practice member since November 2017. My son started care in October 2018.

Dr. Sahota provides quality care and meaningful education to his patients. He empowers, inspires and encourages. He is warm, compassionate, highly intelligent and a great communicator.

I really can't say enough great things about Dr. Sahota and his team at Synapse Chiropractic!< /text>

< review>
I was not sure Chiropractic care would work for me or what it was even truly about. I had tried everything my doctor had prescribed and nothing ever improved my lower back, knee and forearm pains. I have now been treated by Dr. Sahota for about 5 months and within the first month alone, my lower back pain reduced significantly. I was finally able to go on hikes again with no knee pain while hiking downhill. I only wished I would have came in sooner to receive the right treatment for me. Dr. Sahota and his wife are amazing individuals, always so sweet and caring. He is super educational when it comes to why he does what he does and stressing the importance of taking care of our bodies, both, internally and externally, and truly having us how our bodies function. I’ve learned so much in the little amount that I’ve been coming here and feel 50 times better. I would highly recommend to anyone seeking to proactively take care of their bodies or anyone suffering from any type of pain. Thank you, Dr. Sahota, you rock!< /review>

<Text>When you walk into Synapse Chiropractic you are greeted by Ramin.  She is so attentive and always has a beautiful smile.  Dr. Sahota is an amazing doctor. He is very knowledgeable about chiropractic health, and well being.

At first I was hesitant to go to a chiropractor since I’ve heard of horror stories about people getting adjusted and their pain gets worst. Or chiropractors just adjust you and sends you on your way and the pain comes back after a month.  One morning I woke up with lower back pain that I had a hard time getting out of bed. My doctor recommended Synapse since I have been complaining of lower back pain for 4 years. I finally told myself I have to try a chiropractor since I didn’t want a cortisone shot that digenerates your bone. I have tried many different alternatives to relive my back pain. I have tried Bowen therapy, Sports Medicine massages, and  acupuncture.

I have been seeing Dr. Sahota for 2 months now and my back has improved tremendously.< /Text>< pics>

Dr. Sahota is fantastic! He is so knowledgeable, caring and has such a great passion for chiropractic. From the minute you meet him you can tell that he truly cares about all his patients. He has not only helped me with my pain but has helped me reached goals I never thought I could have achieved! I had been suffering with very severe headaches and asthma for years. I was on all sorts of medications and I had gotten to a point in my life where being in pain was normal for me. I had no hope of getting better until  my friend recommended me to Dr. Sahota. I had never tried chiropractic care so I didn’t know what to expect. I am so thankful for my friend and so grateful that I took this step to start chiropractic care. Not only have my headaches and asthma gone away but I am completely DRUG free! Ive never felt this good in my life! Dr. Sahota has completely changed my perspective on health through chiropractic! I can’t thank him enough!< /text>

Dr. Sahota is extremely personable and very easy to talk to.  He puts your health first and makes sure to put a plan in place to have you feeling your best. Highly recommend contacting Dr. Sahota if you have any lingering aches and pains.  Dr. Sahota also adjusted my 5 month old son and did a wonderful job of explaining each movement/benefit.</review>

Since 2004, I have been suffering a from a lot of neck and back pain due to a severe neck injury (Spinal fusion surgery). Since seeing Dr. Sahota, my pain level has decreased exponentially, and my posture has also improved. He has great people skills and is highly professional.  I would deeply recommend Dr. Sahota to anyone including infants, where I witnessed an adjustment on my one month old niece to negate any nervous system interference.  It was truly amazing watching his delicacy with her, including his knowledge on such a wide variety of chiropractic techniques. Patient care extraordinaire!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>I've consistently dealt with back issues throughout my life. Various methods to lessen my back pain and make it more tolerable were tried. I had little to no luck with this until I started visiting Dr. Sahota. In the past, I was not hugely sold on chiropractic methods. It's safe to say that I've changed my views. Dr. Sahota not only does an amazing job with his work, but he takes the time to educate his patients, which not only made me feel more comfortable, but also made me realize how chiropractic care is often overlooked. I absolutely recommend Dr. Sahota!<//review>< pics>

<Review>Rocklin, CA hit the lottery when Dr. and Mrs. Sahota chose this location as their future home and journey.

I am no stranger to chiropractic care and wellness.  As a friend and previous patient, I have watched Dr. Sahota grow as an individual and as a professional.

Watching him grow from an Intern to starting a new chapter in his life with his beautiful bride, to relocating to Rocklin, CA to start his own practice.

The lives that Dr. Sahota touches will make all the difference in the world to those individuals and the ones that he has already touched has forever changed.

He is one of the most gifted and talented chiropractors I have encountered.  I cannot stress enough that attitude and wellness is everything and Dr. Sahota will lead you down that healthy path.< /Review>< response>

<text>Dr. Sahota and his wife are wonderful! Every time I meet Dr. Sahota he is so humble, personable and really educates me about chiropractic. I’ve been looking for a chiropractor for months…and every chiropractor would adjust me and not explain what they're doing, what the cause was, how they’re going to correct it. I was so amazed just speaking to Dr. Sahota! He is definitely ahead of his years! They practice a very different technique in their office which I have not seen at other chiropractic offices. He explained each and every little detail about what they do as a part of their examination process and what they look for. He even has x-ray in his office which saves me a trip to get those done elsewhere. My entire family will be starting care with Dr. Sahota. He has made a tremendous impact on my outlook for a healthier lifestyle. I definitely recommend him for any of your chiropractic needs!</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Sahota is your one stop shop for all your health needs! I came in due to multiple accidents that were causing pain to my back. Dr. Sahota asked about my health habits, migraines, and other issues as well. I noticed that along with my back pain that my migraines went away as well. Before meeting Dr. Sahota I didn't realize how much your spinal health makes a difference in your total and holistic health. Thank you Dr. Sahota for all that you do!</Text>

What a cute little grocery store! For such a small space, they really have a wide selection of specialty items. There's also a good selection of sandwiches, deli salads, and such available from the counter in the back. No seating, but there's a little park about a block and half away around the corner.

Staff are friendly and helpful, ask them about locally sourced products and help support the community while trying new things!<//review>

Hidden in the back of this wonderful gem of a natural, and gourmet grocery store, is a small healthy deli. Filled with all kinds of delicious looking items. Especially a lot of vegetarian and vegan options.
A great place to fill up your picnic basket .</text>

Absolutely fantastic market for unique items and foods you can take with you to visit wineries, nearby and inland, for a perfect picnic lunch. One heck of a lot better than any charcuterie plate for 20 bucks that a winery would sell you… and you choose the items. Super nice and helpful staff.</Text>

Extremely friendly staff. Good selection of organic products and high quality produce. Sandwiches are prepared to order quickly and using high quality ingredients. Problems encountered when paying with a non-US credit card so foreigners should bring cash.<//Text>

Best health food market in the area. This is a small store filled with a huge selection of wonderful healthy and unique choices. I live in the Los Angeles and we have many healthy grocery stores but Soto's is my favorite. The deli located in the rear of store is my favorite.  Wish we had this in my neighborhood.</Review>

The folks who run this market know vegan appetites. Their hot and cold savory dishes are delicious -- we sampled a number of items in the display case and ordered a few recommended hot items from the menu. Everything was so good. My wife and I spent a week driving down the PCH from Half Moon Bay to Morro Bay, and we wished we could have taken this market along with us. Thank goodness for wrapped-up leftovers!< /Review>

At first glance, you might think Soto's is an ordinary market. It's extraordinary - the food is fresh, and serves every palate and dietary need. Go in and make sure you head to the back of the store for a space that shares sandwiches, salads, soup and more!<//text>

Got a sandwich @ Soto’s and found it delicious. Appreciate their sandwich, wrap, bowl selections that are mixed and matched for customizing possibilities. Will definitely eat there again when the chance  arises.< /Text>

I had the quinoa black bean patty and it was great. For all the fancy-ish  restaurants in paso robles and cambria, this meal was probably my most enjoyable. The flavors were southwest inspired but mild. The patty comes with roasted peppers and greens on top. The bun is a pretzel bun, so it doesn't get soggy really quick. The fudge muffin (or cupcake?) for dessert was great too. Not too sweet.</Text>

Size of portions, price, taste. Organisation to pick up (I'm writing this during the COVID).
Really a great place for some nice breakfast/ brunch / lunch food. Highly recommended. Bon appétit.<//Review>

I had catered dessert for an event, and Amy was unbelievably easy, professional, and kind to work with. Dessert was delivered on time. She thoughtfully labeled those desserts with nuts for our guests with nut allergies. We had ordered various cookies, brownies, cake pops, and chocolate covered pretzels, all of which our guests loved. I highly recommend ordering from The Cookie Element for catering and for fun!<//review>

The best cookies and macarons in town.  I have not encountered anyone who has tried their yummy treats and said I've had better.  Everything is made made fresh daily, and should there be any item left they are at half price the next day.  The shop is very clean,  everyone is super nice and friendly.  I highly recommend it.  You have to try this place.< /review>

I can't say enough about the concept of combining culinary art, with the science of chemistry, that is really what baking is all about!

After all, it's Elemental! It's something that I Periodically think, while sitting at a table, especially when enjoying gourmet cookies!

So what better place to go than a high tech cookie laboratory, where they have a Periodic Table of Cookies!

They even got formulas written on the walls! You can even go in your lab coat, wear your safety goggles, and get your Science on, writing on your clipboard, taking copious detailed notes and diagrams, while observing them creating these culinary delights!

And the bottom line is the cookies are GOOD!!!

If it wasn't for that, all this would fall apart... because that's how the cookie crumbles.

Seriously, give it a try, you won't be disappointed!<//Review>

I love The Cookie Element! They just started Gluten Free Monday's and Thursday's and my family is thrilled. I had their G free oatmeal cookie this week and it was the best I've ever had. They also have a reading area for the little ones and that's fun for the kids too.<//Text>

I go by the Cookie Element every week. I have been buying cookies here and using it for marketing for 2 months now with my business. I can't help but grab some for my family too. I get so many comments from both my family and customers about how much they like their cookies. Amy actually set up a weekly order where my company information is printed on the cookies in sugar! How cool is that! It's also very affordable and allows me to stand out with customers. I already recommend the Cookie Element to everyone!< /Text>

<Text>These cookies are to die for. My favorite is the malted cookie which has whoppers inside. The only problem is they dont make enough cookies so you have to get there early if you want to ensure the flavor you want is there. The plain old choclate chip cookie is amazing as well.

We have been to The Cookie Element twice now. They reward readers (my daughter got a free cookie slip from YL Library) that’s what I thought was my favorite thing would be... until we tried the Hawaiian cookie 🤩
Unlike anything you have had ... divine. Give the place a try.. to support good, community business and cause the product is incredible. You won’t regret it. Karyn in Brea< /Review>

Such a clever little cookie shop! We loved every cookie we tried but the chocolate chip is a MUST here. The BEST chocolate chip cookie we ever had!

Atmosphere: The inside is soo beautifully designed with different colors and textures that all go together in harmony. There are two larger tables in the middle and seating at the bar. The tables also have quality crafted basic games to enjoy such as tick tac toe. One of our favorite touches was the periodic table with cookie ingredients!

Food: The cookies are perfectly made, each one its own unique taste. A must try is the chocolate chip cookie, ice cream sandwich version!

Employees: All the employees were really nice and we even got a chance to talk to the owner who was the sweetest lady yet. We loved hearing her passion for this store and how she was inspired by her husband who is a scientist. What a cool story :)

You must go in and try it for yourself or order it at your next party.</review>

< Review>
Bad experience. I just walked out after being pushed to the back of the line by the very polite staff. This after another one of the staff chose to ignore me and help a person that just came in.  Very poor in my book. I can't even say they were busy. :(</Review>

<Review>I’m a Home owner and I used House  match since early 2018 (3 years) and this company is really professional !! In every little details , from listing to maintenance departments everything is extremely smooth and easy to dealing with. Paul, Christine,Rick,Linda,David, Julio and the rest of their crew are nicely, available for questions and here to help you. Especially if you out of state. So don’t think twice, hire House match for Worthing price!<//Review>< user_name>

I have leased with House Match almost 5 years now and they have always been responsive and professional. Work orders are taken care of in a timely manner and there is always a follow through evaluation on how they have done. The staff is great and Paul and Christine should be commended for their consistently high standards for this company. Keep up the great work, House Match!<//Review>

<Review>I bought a fixer rental in Murrietta which is fourty miles from where I live. I was planning on managing it myself, however, I had a very difficult time getting contractors to call me back. After two weeks of frustration, I decided to hire a property manager. I spoke to several companies and when I spoke to Christine at House Match we clicked right away.
I met her at the house the next day, signed the agreement and let her use her vast vendor resources. We had to do, roofing repair, plumbing, electric work, drywall repair, install all new smoke detectors, install carpet in three rooms,  and had exterior trim and several interior walls repainted. We even did some extensive landscaping clean up and sprinkler repairs.
All of the contractors that I spoke to on the phone and met at the house  were great, very professional and did outstanding quality work.
House Match ( Christine and team ) were wonderful to work with and did a great job communicating with me.
On top of all of the work they did to get my house ready to rent, they found a well qualified tenant in one week.
Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased I hired House Match. If I hadn't
hired them, I would probably still be waiting for contractors to call me back.< /Review>< rate>

<Time>1563753274004</Time><review>Thank you House Match for being the best in the business. Your company made it seamless to transition back into our home after the great job your company did managing our property. Drew and his crew was the absolute best keeping us informed about everything pertaining to our home. A special thank you goes to David who was extremely professional and paramount to making our home look absolutely stunning. The painting and minor repairs were top notch.  Thank you.< /review><username>MICHAEL POPE<//username>< pics>

I work with a number of property managers across the country and I must say Paul is one of the best I have ever worked with. The attention to detail and quality of service provides great success and peace of mind. If you are consider property management in Temecula, look no further!<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I am a renter with House Match. In these times of need they have really stepped up to help me and my family out. The COVID 19 pandemic really hit me and my family hard.  We have a small business in Temecula on which we rely on for our main source of income. Our business is not considered essential and was closed on March 15th 2020 and we remain closed. This huge burden has resulted in my family struggling to make ends meet. With being behind on rent for our home and workplace. House Match has stepped up and made a difference. They have offered us free meals and now have offered us partial credit for our rent that is behind by 3 months. This Company needs to be given credit where credit is due. Thank you House Match for being such a stand up, good faith company!!< /Text>< pics>

What a great company. We are currently renting out one of house matches rentals and in the process of searching for another home rental! I cant say enough the owner reached out and was willing to help us secure a home. It can be tough finding the perfect rental, due to the competition of others looking for rental homes. Everyone I have encountered that works for housematch is professional, genuine, and willing to help!!!!!! Highly recommend to anybody!</Review>

We have been tenants of House Match for the past two years, and have been thrilled with our experience. Our property managers are honest, thoughtful, courteous, and friendly. It is rare to find this in a property management company. Our needs have been consistently met, while also having been given the space to really feel as though our rental home is OUR home. If you have an opportunity to work with House Match, you will not be disappointed in the outcome!<//text>

House Match Property Management took over my property after I had a hand full of issues from Grapevine Property Management. Paul over at House Match has been very professional and up front since day one. The tenant moving out created many obstacles and Paul handled this all professionally and even helped her out more then he should have. He's always looking out for what's best for the homeowners, the tenants, and his company, all while providing outstanding services. House Match operates as a team so they quickly and efficiently take care of all matters at hand. Being an out of state homeowner it has put me at ease knowing there is always someone available. I wish I had found them a long time ago! I'm very happy with their services and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND them to any homeowners or those looking to rent!<//text>

They know their stuff when it comes to selling properties and managing them. They also keep up with the latest technology and marketing tactics in order to help their clients best.

<UserId.>105163171675288668008</UserId.><review>I worked with Christine for buying my house in San Diego county. She was very helpful and enthused about showing us houses around different neighborhoods in San Diego. Sometimes this meant spending entire day. She was very patient with us since we had to carry our little 7 months old son with us during every visit. Someone else in her position would have complained but she never once did.

She educated us at various points during the home buying process. Sometimes there were unexpected delays in the process. However Christine handled this very patiently and professionally without offending either party.

One thing I really like to mention is that Paul (her husband) underwent a major surgery for his leg during the time we were still looking for houses with her. Christine adhered to her schedule/appointments despite her personal commitments at family. This level of commitment and customer service, really makes her stand apart from the rest of the agents you may ever work with.

She was also very punctual about showing up for her appointments, finishing her paperwork, following up with lender, listing agent etc. She normally responds to texts within one hour if she is busy otherwise her responses are immediate. She also gives a lot of heads up if she is going to be away for any reason. She took care of lot of work for us in the background (dealing with escrow, lender etc), to save us troubles. I am happy to have worked with her and would recommend her to anyone trying to buy a home in San Diego or Temecula county.

We closed escrow on our home today and I am really thankful to Christine for her hard work and perseverance. I wish Christine and Paul, good luck and want to see this couple, take their business to greater heights.</review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

We hired Paul and Christine of House Match back in 2014 to manage our rental properties in Temecula and Murrieta and have never once regretted the decision.  Their management fees are fair yet their service is well and above what we expected. They are quick to assess what needs to be done for the property and they have quick access to any number of maintenance persons whether the issue is landscaping or electrical. I have felt that all of their maintenance persons are top notch and reasonable. Christine and Paul are extremely professional and knowledgeable regarding how to handle rental units and tenants. They understand that my rentals properties are a business and manage them as such. They also are very good with tenants, treat them with respect but still are able to enforce all rules and regulations and collect the rent without delay. They are also very knowledgeable regarding California Landlord—Tenant rules and regulations.  This knowledge alone could save you hundreds of dollars over the course of your property ownership.   They return phone calls/texts/emails almost immediately, even on weekends. Since hiring them, I no longer dread the late night calls about an air conditioning unit failing or worrying about how to real with a non-rent paying tenant.  Christine and Paul are also above the top when it comes to integrity and honesty.  With this team you get great rates, excellent service, happy tenants, honest and ethical property managers and your rent collected in a timely manner.   I highly recommend that you give House Match a try.  You will not be disappointed.</text>

I wanted to like this place since I support mom and pop stores. But here are the issues: The items he sells are very overpriced! I went in for some rubbing alcohol and he had it priced at $1.50 for the smallest bottle I've ever seen. This would be 99 cents at the 99 cent store. Then I kindly asked him if he had pencil lead? He just pointed to the isle. I witness him have an attitude with just about everyone who came in except for the Blacks. I guess he's scared of Black people. I didn't know color made a difference being he is Asian from another country or his parents migrated here from another country. I will not be returning.< /review>

Well-designed, eclectic bookstore in Oakland. Mostly new books but a small selection of magazines and used books available also. (March 2019)< /Review>

<Name>Keelia Alder<//Name><Review>They're so friendly and easy to work with, and they make book ordering and pickup super easy, especially during COVID! You can order everything online, they email you when your order is packaged and ready for pickup, and you just pop in and pick it up! Ditch amazon, support this beloved local bookstore instead 😄< /Review>< date>

It had a good selection when I looked around had some of the classics and of course newer book. I wouldn't however go for older book. I was causally look to add the Hannibal series by Thomas Harris which I couldn't find on their selves unfortunately. They did offer to order it for me but as I was visiting I wouldn't be there long enough to get it. It had a good selection there were many titles I wrote down to read later.< /Text>

Needed a gift support quick! The staff is quite knowledgeable and many were helpful. They also have free giftwrapping which looked very nice. Some bookstores are not as neat and don't look as professional. Don't be fooled by the store front. This is a great sized store with excellent finds!</review>

These people love books. The experience is inevitably curated, as the proprietors are dealing with limited square footage in a high rent district. You should stop by, though, to see what they do. Unusual books about interesting things! They are skewing their demographic toward children, slightly, which is likely good for them.<//Text>

<Text>The selection here has been so thoughtfully curated and they truly know their customers. The selection looks deceptively small but they always have exactly what I'm looking for from vegetarian/vegan cooking to natural dyes to chart topping popular fiction. This is the kind of place you can go when you don't have anything in mind and leave with a new treasure.< /Text>< Rate>

More than anything, I appreciate the clear signage and intuitive layout of the stores and genres - it’s really easy to find what you’re looking for and at the same time, you’ll likely find a few interesting other books along the way.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80857de84f0bfcef:0x3e860a257790e0dc<//gmapID></record>

Truly a lovely bookstores experience. Interesting staff recommendations, nice browsing layout, lots of cards and gift choices. They will order anything for you and it arrives quickly. Really, buy your books here instead of ordering online ... support a local business and enjoy looking around and discovering something new.</review>

A cute, quaint little boutique bookstore in Rockridge. I've popped in here many times throughout high school to browse the selections. Over the years, they've updated the organization of the store--the children's section is much neater now. It used to be much messier and crowded. Lighting has brightened, and even though this is a pretty small bookstore, they still have a decent selection of books, and I can spend quite a while browsing here. They also have couches that you can sit on and read.

The staff is also very friendly and knowledgeable. Even if they don't have a book in their store, they're able to order it for you so that it's ready for you to pick up when it arrives. Definitely happy to see this local indie bookstore surviving the recession and remaining a staple in the Rockridge neighborhood.< /text>

I came into this store around 1:30pm on a Wednesday. There was one cashier present and she seemed to be on a call. I walked up to the designated waiting area in front of the cashier to wait but was never greeted. There was one other customer already present browsing around on her own when I walked in. A few minutes later another associate came in and asked the other worker if she was helping and she said no and asked if he could help. I asked if he could place my invisible glass shield on my phone and he refused saying they aren't allowed to for liability purposes since I didn't purchase it from them. I made the purchase through Verizon over the phone. This store is an authorized Verizon dealer. I don't see why I can't receive the same service I just received two months ago at the Verizon Cerritos location. The attendant in Cerritos was able to place my invisible shield on even though it was purchased physically in store, and he didn't even asked if it had been purchased through Verizon. This was a waste of time, a wasted trip and the customer service was flat out bad. There was no attempt to solve the problem, the team didn't show any interest in figuring out how to assist me. On top of that I can't get through to call any other Verizon stores to confirm they will assist me with this request, since it's clear that some stores won't. I'd prefer to confirm where I can go to get this service before having to drive across town back to Cerritos.</text>

I highly recommend this Verizon store. We were helped by Angelina. She is very knowledgeable and efficient. The store manager Luis was also knowledgeable and helpful to other customers while we were in the store. Definitely coming back to this Verizon store when needed.< /review>

I had a very positive experience in store.The Verizon employees where attentive to there consumers.Also they made sure we're all safe in the store with social distances while you shop.The store was clean and orderly and services was quick.They make sure that you have all you needed before you left the store.The only down side is if you get or have a prepaid cell phone you won't be able to find a sleeve for that kind of phone there and you won't.The best place to find a sleeve for your prepaid cell phone is at Amazon.com.Also they don't carry prepaid cell phones rather, the best place to find a prepaid cell phone is Walmart superstore.But they do carry wipes to keep your device clean and popsockets for as low as five dollars.Now if you want your new phone to get everything transfered from your old phone,that's about twenty dollars.Happy shopping.😁< /text>

Only had one employee working that evening.  I wanted to upgrade my phone with the newest models.  Had old phones not the current ones in the industry.  Waist of time.  Go to the real Verizon store where they have more then one person working there.  If you have alot of time on your hands then go here.</Text>

<Text>I have had some horrible experiences with my phone due to the fact I'm old school and not computer savvy BUT you have a salesperson here by the name of Angelina that you soo Blessed to have her as a worker, she has always helped me willingly with much patience and humbled and she's the only reason I visit this store. The best worker, character, personality and i could go on and on but all I'm saying is she's appreciated and she'll truly be missed if she leaves and while I was visiting the store everyone that came in asked for her as well...I love her and Thanks Angelina!I'm not the type to leave comments but I had too lol she didn't tell me either 😁I learned patience from her and humbleness from her and take this on my job! THANK YOU!<//Text>< user_name>

Diego's service at this store was impeccably perfect! When I went to this store a couple nights ago to purchase a MiFi, Diego answered every question thoroughly and patiently. Even though it ran past their closing time, he never commented or complained. Given I should have arrived sooner so as to not be asking him ??s after their closing time, I really appreciated his help up & after their closing time. Thanks, Diego.. :-)<//Review>

My son is so happy. We went into the Verizon store because he locked the phone. Alex was able to get it open and working. Now I don't have to worry about him after school. Michelle (the other employee)  was able to explain my bill and payment options. I'll definitely  be back. Thanks guys!!!<//review>

She helped us every step of the way and even days after purchasing his new phone we called her to have her help us and she always answered with kindnesses and willingness to help my Dad and I out. So if you ever come to this location ask for Angelina thank you again Angelina God bless you and your family

Darya helped me to get a new phone after I dropped my old one in the pool. She addressed to my needs and helped find the best option, this time I also got insurance. She was very friendly and definitely knew everything about the phones. The best thing is that she was fast.</Review>

This new Verizon Wireless store is great! Both Alex and Edward  are phone savvy, aware of promotions and very upfront with prices. There are no hidden fees and they explain all the charges in store and on your monthly bills. Very friendly! I would highly recommend this place!</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>In an era where customer service seems to be an afterthought for some, of not most, businesses, it is refreshing to encounter people within business who actually care. R Wireless, a Verizon retail store, is one of these businesses. First, I'm thrilled that there is a local Place that I can go to right in Bixby Knolls that does EVERYTHING that the Verizon store does in Lakewood...talk about convenience! Second, the staff is nice, knowledgeable and accommodating. Michelle, one of thei sales associates not only helped me with the purchase of my new iPhone 7, but also advised me on products and options.

Lastly, the manager came over to say hello and made me feel like I was an important part of the business. I'm very pleased with the services and so happy that R Wireless is in my neighborhood!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1483370406515, 'text': 'Thank you for your business and for taking time to share your experience with us.

<review>came in because my phone did not have any storage to even receive emails on my phone. dealt with the store manager Tomas and he was absolutelyamazing! he took the time to review with me what was taking up all my storage and offered a simple solution with a memory chip. he also took the time to look over my plan and guide me to the correct plan to save me money. this store is awesome! will continue to do business going forward.< /review>< pics>

Amazing customer service!!! They were very helpful and gave me a cost saving plan.  I upgraded to a brand new smartphone and my monthly bill will be less than what I was playing before. I was definitely a satisfied customer.  Best Verizon store I have been to. I would recommend Manni; he was a great rep!!< /Text>

He spent at least 2 hours working on my case.  He was professional and friendly and knowledgeable and many other great things.

Finally made the switch to Verizon and couldn't be happier, not to mention the excellent service I got from all the employees at this store but especially Misha. Even though she was new I could tell she was trained right and made the whole process simple and enjoyable.  I wounderstand highly recommend her service to anyone reading this.< /review>

<Review>So happy this store made it to Bixby! I was tired of driving to the lakewood verizon when I need in-store assistance. Michelle was a doll. She provided great customer service and even gave me a great rate on my iPhone 7 accessories!!!< /Review>< Time>

Well.....Today is my first experience at a Verizon store. I had the pleasure of being serviced by the store manager by the name of Tomas! He was ABSOLUTELY AMAZINGLY. I couldn't have had a better experience.

<text>Unfortunately we just had to walk out of there, we stood there for about 15 minutes and not once did either of the 2 reps in the store acknwolegde that we were there until I addressed one of them and I was told to wait ... No Welcome! or we will be right with you ... I understand they were both with customers but a simple hello we will be right with you wouldn't have taken much effort to do since there was no other customers there  ... Definitely not the way to start for a new business who should be doing their best to aquire all the new business they can ... As a business owner myself, this is not the treatment I would appreciate my customers to receive from my employees ...</text>< Pics>

I worked with the manager Tomas Zuniga who went above and beyond to get everything to work out perfectly or us. He had the phone colors we wanted transferred in from another store and spent a lot of time with the Verizon corporate customer service to get the upgrade issue resolved in a satisfactory manner. Tomas was great. He was so patient and diligent and did everything to make our experience at the R Wireless (Verizon Premium Retailer) a GREAT experience. I will go back here for sure if I have any future issues with my phone/service.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Receptionist are really rude, helpless they don’t try to help you they avoid you. I called to see if I was able to speak to the doctor to get a reRefilled of my medicine but the receptionist that answer was really rude didn’t let me explain to her why I need to talk to him she was just trying to hang up the whole time and told me that I wasn’t ably to talk to the doctor until my appointment this is the second time they do this why can a patient speak to there own doctor when they have a question ???..But In the other hand the doctor is great but just his staff in the front desk are really unprofessional..< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Can't really understand the negative reviews and comments on here.
Don't pay any attention.
There is plenty of seating area.
Please understand this is a very busy doctors office so expect a wait time.
On the other hand, you could arrive on a day that they are not so busy it depends.
The staff took good care of my needs.
The doctor and office staff here are very nice and knowledgeable people, you will be in good hands I promise and highly recommend.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Dr. Leo Hernandez is very experienced and always spot on with his diagnosis.   Yes because he knows his craft he is super busy and you have to wait, but if you want a correct diagnosis it's worth the wait. I highly recommend him.< /review><Date>1608177028606< /Date></record>

I don't know how people give this office bad reviews, my appointment was at 12:30, I arrived there at 12:10 was seen right on time . I was out from the office by 1pm, staff was very friendly and Dr. Hernandez took the time to explained to me my options for treatment for melasma..< /review>

<review>Everyone who is reviewing negatively is just impatient and doesn’t understand that it’s a highly trafficked clinic.
Of course you’re gonna wait, it’s a doctor’s office.

Aside from the wait, the staff is really nice, there’s plenty of seats to wait on, and the doctor is nice and sometimes funny. He explains your condition as simply as possible and gets you in and out.

We're facing a pandemic, maybe some don't understand or believe the severity of the situation, but I do. Many can't keep a distance or just don't care and what's worse is that there's signs on the floor and even though the lobby is small, people just don't care and like to walk across or sit near you without keeping in mind the consequences. Overall the Doctors and the nurse who does the treatments are cool< /review>

The front desk staff are amazing. However the office is tiny. Way too many ppl booked for appointments  at the same time. Its packed so forget about the 6ft distance were bumping elbows & more & more people keep piling in. Theres 17 people in here right now & its like then an 100 x 100 sq feet area. I will not reccoment this place.<//Review>

< Review>
He is really unprofessional He came in the room did not wash his hands I asked him if he washed his hands before touching my child’s skin and he got bothered and asked me if I washed my hands I do not recommend this doctor he made me feel like my concerns where not taken in consideration really rude.Also the waiting time is insane my appointment was 7:45 I got out at 9:40 it’s really unprofessional to not keep appointments the time they are scheduled this doctor only does his work for the money not to care his patients awful experience

Also the front desk lady is rude and lazy which is no surprise since the doctor is the same this business should close</Review>

<Review>Horrible place do not come to this doctor. Like other reviews say they do not respect the appointment time. My appointment was at 12:15 , I know you are supposed to fill out paperwork so we arrived 20 mins early. Didn’t matter still waited two hours before being seen. Had no choice to wait since making another appointment somewhere else would just take more time before being seen. DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE PLUS THEY HAVE NO PARKING AND STREET PARKING IS LIMITED.< /Review>< user_id>

< review>
Very unhappy with this place. Customer service is horrible and if you have an appointment, be ready to wait at least 2 hours. My 3 year old son's appointment was at 10:30, we arrived at least 10 minutes before. I told the lady in the front desk that i had to leave at least by 12 because my son had a dentist appointment at 12:30. She said, the waiting time with appointment is 1 hour😲 , so you should be out by that time.
We waited and waited.....
After one hour and a half i decided to get up and ask if we going to be called soon because i had to leave for my other appointment and this time she seamlessly said, there is a at least one hour wait time for you to be called in. Seriously, she had told me 1 hour waiting rime with appoinment and now it went up to 2:30 just to wait to be seen. Ridiculous, why bother giving appointments if you are not going to respect the time. I was very frustrated and decided to leave. This appointment was for a 3 year old child, he should not have to wait this long. Did not get to see the doctor, but just by looking at the way the staff and the place was, i can only imagine what it would look like inside. The place is a very small waiting room with people almost stepping on each other. I have never been to such place. I do not recommend this place to anyone, find another place where they really appreciate patients.  I am going to report this practice to my insurance.</review>

<text>I have the luck to go to this office year's ago after my baby had canser wort he told me that they are not cancer and that not to worry I believe in him and it's been 15 years and the worts never came back  the waiting is long but is because the doctor takes  time with each and every one of them he doesn't Rush you out and  he hear all your questions and concerns about the problem you are going to see him for the best on what he does< /text>< pictures>

The doctor and the Doctor assistant are wonderful but the office ladies are rude. I need to renew my authorization but the front desk lady wants me to take the otc when my insurance told me they just need an authorization to get that medication again. She’s forcing me to get the OTC when the DR said NO<//review>

< Review>
Waited over 2 months for an appointment. I asked for the day off from work to make it. I arrived at the office early in the morning. When I signed in I was told they do they do not accept PPO insurance. I asked why they didn't tell me that when I made the appointment and stated I was new. I got no response. Total waste of time. Very rude unsympathetic and unprofessional. Go somewhere else.</Review>

I was told to be on time for my appointment and they kept me waiting for over 2 hours,!! one of the receptionist was rude and very mean ... she thinks can yell and scream at people just because she is behind the counter.
What a pendeja!!!! If you late for any appointment is very disrespectful,  this place doesn't know this... hey i Forgot this is EAST LOS ANGELES so we Latinos deserve to be treated like that and worse.<//text>

A terribly frustrating experience. Waited an unacceptable two hours and ten minutes beyond my appointment time, and had to leave. Never met the doctor. The office was packed with people, all of whom were waiting as long as I. No apologies for the ridiculous wait time - it seems this is business as usual at this office.< /text>

If the Doctor is so good that it always happens super full, be patient that you are waiting for the best dermatologist in California.
and do not make trouble because good costs.

<text>(Translated by Google) This business is only interested in the business, not the welfare of the people. My appointment was to remove a large berruga on my nose, wait more than a month for them to remove another small one, or to consider it elsewhere. And they were very rough, and they got me out because I was wasting my time

(Original)
Este negocio, solo le interesa el negocio no el bienestar de la gente. Mi cita era para remover una berruga grande en mi nariz, espere mas de un mes para q segun ellos me removieran otro pequeno q ni en cuenta en otro lado. Y fueron bien groceros, y me sacaron por q los estaba haciendo perder el tiempo</text>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) The truth is that Doctor Leopoldo is a doctor for the Latin community who speaks our language, many times people wait because, as he is so good, he has a lot of demand since there are few Latin dermatologists and that is why his office is full but this The doctor will fear and heal the truth that I watched as my son suffered. I took him to the doctor and it was a miracle that what is left over to this doctor is knowledge and experience. Our family all went to their offices and we have a lot of faith. EXCELLENT DOCTOR IN THE ANGELS of his staff are very friendly if one complains it is because we are bad blood but the truth they treat you with respect and dignity.

GOD BLESS YOU DOCTOR LEOPOLDO AND GIVE YOU MANY YEARS MORE THAN THIS HELP US IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH AND GUAL FOR ALL HIS ASSISTANTS WHO WORK VERY HARD AND WITH A LOT ORDER TO COMPLEMENT SO MANY APPOINTMENTS.

(Original)
La verdad que el Doctor Leopoldo es un medico para la comunidad Latina que habla nuestro idioma, muchas veces la gente espera ya que como es tan Bueno tiene mucha demanda ya que son pocos los dermatologos latinos y es por eso que su oficina se llena pero este medico temira y te sana la verdad que yo mire como sufria mi hijo lo lleve con el doctor y fue un milagro lo que mas le sobra a este medico es conocimiento y experiencia nuestra familia todos acudimos a sus oficinas y le tenemos mucha fe. EXCELENTE MEDICO EN LOS ANGELES de su personal son muy amables si uno se queja es por que somos mala sangre pero la verdad te tratan con respeto y dignidad.

QUE DIOS LE BENDIGA DOCTOR LEOPOLDO Y LE BRINDE MUCHOS AÑOS MAS QUE ESTE AYUDANDONOS EN EL CAMPO DE LA SALUD Y GUAL PARA TODAS SUS ASISTENTES QUE TRABAJAN MUY DURO Y CON MUCHA ORDEN PARA COMPLEMENTAR TANTAS CITAS.<//review><UserId.>115312191075111297290<//UserId.>< Pics>

If you sign up for their mailers you will get their coupons and you will get really low prices. Its kind of odd that they have 3 different prices on their items. The regular price, sale price and the lowest coupon price for members. They have a lot of different items.

Always visit this store , they have pretty good selections on tools , this is good for a quick stop to get what you need , they have a lot of coupons too . They have good price but if you have coupons , you will not forget this store . But the only bad thing is when you have a free coupon and that item went bad after days or weeks , possible will not exchange it for you because is a free from coupon . But for me no biggie when i buy something again i will get that free item again with my coupon . To get a free coupon ask the cashier to put you on list so you will mail a booklet of coupons at home for free . I give 4 star coz some of products is not a good quality .< /Text>

Lots of great deals! Definitely worth a look see. Get comparable gear for a fraction of the price. Save yourself some money and take a look at all their great options. Staff were very friendly and helpful.<//text>

Lots of low priced tools, and regular sales can save you even more. A lot of the tools and equipment are not designed for heavy duty professional use but can be great for the occasional   DIY user.<//text>

I've never had a problem at this location. The employees are usually very helpful from the time you enter the store but today I was treated like I was going to pocket something. I know the store so well because I come in all the time so no hellos at entering. Rather than asking if we needed assistance this one employee came to make his presence known. I made a comment saying I don't need to steal with this money I worked for and took my money out so he can see. I'm at the register and the cashier replied to whomever contacted him over the earpiece saying yes they are here paying. Really! Get a life and if anyone would steal you better have a license to detain a person or management cause all you do is get a law suit against the store and the person stealing wins</review>

<Text>Harbor Freight on a sales holiday is like being a kid in a candy store at Xmas. Plus the 25% coupon via snail mail or email always gives you a reason to buy that bigger ticket item you've been eyeing.  Tools, tarps, camping stuff, electronic tools. Lights, industrial working man/woman tools. All here at China product prices.... and, oh please, look in the small print to see whom manufactured those last set of ..... you bought at Home Depot. Even stuff for my Jeep I got for overlanding, I got at this place! Save mucho, but wait if you can for the coupons!< /Text><Time>1567488981888<//Time><user_name>Rik Shannon</user_name><user>117476652797407371664</user><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tools and supplies just at this store and expect nothing more than plain courtesy,  if not respect, but this employee destroyed any empathy I had for the brand.</review>< user_name>

Love this place. My Father and I have been using this place for many years. We are constantly trying to outdo each other with good deals.
BTW,  I call B.S. on Bill Hill and his "20% restocking fee" story. We have returned items a number of times and NEVER had any problems or fees.

Great for inexpensive items. I don't know why some items have such a bad odor.   Look for coupons. Lots to see and buy.< /text>

Good makeup of value and high end products. Sign up for their email to get some pretty good deals on quality stuff. The couple of times I've had questions they were very helpful.< /review>

I don't like the bait and switch that do, I seen an item for $13.99, if you join their membership for $30 if you don't then the price is $17.99.
Really? These are cheap Chinese tools. Hope someone fixes this mess!< /Text>

There is always something type of coupon for a discount and a free item. Make sure to download their app so you can save money by looking up the the item number. Most if the time there will be a couple of coupons.<//review>

< Review>
I'm not real impressed with this store. I went in to buy a vibratory tumbler and the one on the display isn't the one they have on the shelves for you to buy. So I asked the sales person if I could get the display model and he said there was no way because he would have to ask corporate and that wasn't going to happen so a bit of bait and switch if I do say so myself.<//Review>

I had problems in this place with saleswoman she behaved to put it mildly very rude, was a bad service. After that I visited this place many times and that saleswoman also works on this place and became very polite but one sedovolosyj salesman of old age began to behave rudely despising to look at me harass inadvertently push and for it is not apologize. I think he's the boss, and he's probably the team leader defending his colleagues. But I think it's not right because they forgot this place is not their property They work and their duty to show high service and please more goods. And if someone from the buyer was offended by the seller then they should no longer allow this and versa to make a good relationship with the offended buyer. The situation opposite is not enough that I was insulted and the bad relationship continues on this as an organized mafia! Do not recommend to visit and if you will have problems the 100% sellers will be vengeful to you And will not apologize because they feel unpunished!< /text>

<Text>I just left this location. Service was bad. I stood in line to purchase something and as soon as the male cashier was done ringing up the person infront of me he said I am done, I am going home. District bother to say "ma'am I am closed". Total dick! Now I see why my boyfriend disnt want to ask anyone any questions. The employees are a**holes. Including the person who rang me up. She was rude. I will definitely be going to The Home Depot or Aces hardware instead.<//Text>< Time>

Jummm this place had been my favorite for over 4 years till two weeks ago, I buy the  guarantee in every single item that I brought that way if something  goes bad I can go and exchange it, but now it turns out they don't sell the same item I brought some while ago and  even tho they knew I had my guarantee, they refusee to do something to help me.</review>

Cashier was very rude. A customer told her .... I have a coupon..and Natasha...the checker said....And ?.... at least 10 people in line and no call for another checker. She was the only one. No sense of urgency whatsoever  ! I won't be back.<//Review>

I went to return a hitch receiver because it was missing the D-ring, and they would not accept the return because it was missing a piece... makes sense right?

terrible  customer service<//review>
