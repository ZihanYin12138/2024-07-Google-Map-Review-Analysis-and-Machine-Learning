< Review>
I would always give five stars to any Subway except for the fact that our sandwich artist had quite the attitude. If someone doesn't like their job that is serving me food, I'm smart enough to go ahead and still treat them very kindly. But it doesn't mean that I dismiss their behavior. If he doesn't like his job, he shouldn't take it out on the customers, he should find another line of work.</Review>

I love the employees. They are fast, efficient and very nice. I have given it 15 chances though. Even tried to get different bread. Every single time the bottom of the bread is stale half the times the top was stale as well. Cant go anymore. Wasting my money.</text>

I ordered online an Italian BMT salad, when my husband brought it home we discovered there was no lettuce or dressing!! Just a bowl full of toppings 😩 Unbelievable! And when I called store to inform them, auto message said they were busy and to call back another day 😡<//Text>

Today I came to this place and the person who was helping me was mean. She didn’t understand what I wanted and she made me say this again. When I said what I wanted on my sandwich she made me repeat it again. Since a order more than one sandwich I ask her for more napkins but she only gave me 2. I believe her name was Jammy. A costumer should never fell like I did.< /Review>

I've been here a few times and the workers are always nice, but everytime it seems as if they dont really know what they're doing or what's going on, and I dont think it's to any fault of their own. This time they used the wrong type of chicken, wrong cheese, didnt know what one of the new promotional items even was and looked at me in pure confusion when I asked for it. I dont think it's their fault, seems to me wherever is in management, or is training the workers is dropping the ball.</review>

<Text>If you can get there while the bread is soft, then get them to wash their hands between sandwiches and then get them to cut your sandwich with a clean knife, then you may get a good sandwich. The 3 stars are just based upon the availability of tuna fish as that is the only sandwich I would consider buying for $7.99. I can get a whole pound of lunch meat for the price of one sandwich. Way overpriced for lunch meat and veggies.< /Text>< user_name>

<review>Bought 6 sandwiches, yes they did take people out of order. I had no problem with people with 1 sandwich paying before me, so what. I had a large order.....Sandwiches were excellent as usual.

It's OK for when you're starving but not sure if it's really food. They are sparse on the ingredients and it's quite spendy for something that had little taste and left me hungry for something else.< /text>

all around terrible service. first they helped people in odd orders. she helped the person behind me more than me "let me just help him first sir"...ever so condescending. they refused to take cash because they had to run to the bank first. and their credit card system was down and had to be restarted several times. I said just give my card back and I'll go elsewhere and he said "just another minute, count it 6 times. and paid full price for the inconvience. thanks subway. this branch needs new management that's keeps on the ball.<//review>

<Text>Alameda Natural Grocery is the hippest place to shop for groceries in Alameda. In fact, some peeps come from the "mainland" to shop there.

As I entered the store from their parking lot, on the left was a bulletin board with information about music and children. On the right, there was a bakery display case. I couldn't resist getting a large crispy breadstick with seeds, jalapeno and cheese. I also got some  chocolate chip, molasses, and oatmeal cookies--they were so delicious I almost ate them all before getting back in my car.

They have a fresh fish and meat market where there is a butcher to make those special cuts of meat. Also, the animal products come from animals that are raised humanely. You can actually smell the fish before you buy (who wants to buy old stinky fish?) They have a wide variety of foods for vegans, and people on special diets, too. They steer away from chemically processed foods, including GMO. They have a beautiful selection of organic fruits and vegetables including the largest selection of fresh mushrooms I have seen in the East Bay.

They carry just about everything you would expect for a natural food store. Something that surprised me located above their large selection of chocolate bars was some really beautiful large woven baskets. You can see them in my photos.

I love coming to this store!<//Text>< pictures>

A great market for high quality items, with a particularly good meat department, and one that local restaurant tours shop at for their aged meat selections. the food at the store is a little more expensive, and not really for the budget minded. It is however super high quality, and the people that work at the store are very nice< /text>

The marketplace has a tiny sushi bar, bakery, & deli. The deli includes premade salads, Mac n cheese, & 3 types of sandwich, also premade (with the exception of the chicken bon oui). They don’t make any fresh chicken salad sandwiches after they sell out of the premade ones. However, they do make the chicken bon oui. I’m not sure what takes so long to prepare the chicken bon oui sandwich. 4 customers received fresh tossed salads before I got 2 chicken sandwiches. The chicken is already chopped into cubes, and simply scooped out of a container. The only other ingredient on the sandwich is an overly oily coleslaw, so adding those 2 ingredients in a bread roll seems like a fairly swift task. I would have given the bakery rave reviews of the bread, if the slaw oil hadn’t soaked into most of it. Quite frankly, I paid way too much money and waited far too long for probably the worst sandwich of my life. Other than that, the staff was friendly.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The Alameda Natural Grocery is an amazing market, also famous for keeping beehives on the rooftop.  The classic old Ford dealership building is home to this market and several other smaller shops complementary of the grocery store.

The people were friendly and very helpful.  It was inspiring to see people as busy as their bees, stocking shelves as quickly as shoppers were gathering produce and more.  ;)</text>

<review>We sometimes go here exclusively for a good selection of produce, bulk bins and milk in refundable glass bottles. Everything else is way too expensive. Also lots of products are packaged in plastic just like Trader Joe's or any other grocery store, but sold at a much higher price.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The main draw of this place is the shops inside - they have a bakery, a butchers counter, and a cheese & wine shop. All three are high priced, but excellent quality; the bakery in particular does delicious loaves of bread, and they have a great variety.

Note that the bakery has coffee and an espresso machine, but don't waste your time, it's not very good. At the other end of the store is a coffee shop which is much, much better. If you're looking for some sort of breakfast item like a croissant or pastry, get that at the bakery and get coffee at the Beanery.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1551079089473, 'text': 'Hi Dylan.\nThank you so much for your review.\nWe take your feedback very seriously, and appreciate it.'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808f8694f8bf042d:0x27d36f09bb237a46< /Gmap_id></record>

< review>
There's something promising, even inspiring, about walking the aisles of the Alameda Natural Grocery. Always an interesting selection of products, from the dark chocolates to the spices, from the fresh fruits and veggies to the canned alternatives. All the coffee beans.

There's something grounding about seeing the prices; I'm frequently stopped short midway through reaching for something by the vanity or convenience margin added. Fresh, organic, and even exotic items are available everywhere, at competitive prices, so the ANG needs to step up their game.

There's great possibility here, but without the prices to match. I'll keep returning, getting those things which just can't be found elsewhere in the area, but it'll take a lot to make ANG my first shopping stop.< /review>

If I had unlimited funds I would shop here for pretty much everything I needed.  The open air market with a decent bulk section, decent produce, decent spices, and a great varied milk/dairy section as well as plenty of veggie options and labeled locally produced food makes this a place to lust after.

I can't afford to make this my everyday shopping venue - yet - but maybe someday.  The staff has always been friendly.  Park street is great and this is a vital part of why it is a vibrant area.< /review>

Cashier named Tarryn was rude. Chatting with another employee while I was waiting in front of her. Did not apologize for having me wait. And when I asked a question she gave me a very sassy attitude while answering with sarcasm.< /Text>

Good natural food store. Prices are often slightly high, but worth it for the convenience and friendly quick service.</text>

Great place. Friendly staff, good selection of groceries. One caveat: they really only have organic items, so no cake flour or other items that are not available as organic.< /Text>

< review>
I was expecting a lot more based on the reviews, but the prices, selection and services all left more to be desired. The produce that we did buy was "organic" but besides that over-hyped selling point it was all small, lacked flavor (almost all of the fruits) and very limited in selection. During the check-out, the guy working the register REALLY seemed like he didn't want to be there. I won't be going back here.</review>

The market has become dirtier in the past year and the staff definitely  has the hipster attitude about evrrything, including the customers. Will be going to Dan's Produce for a while.< /text>

Rude stuff. Lady in front of me washed her car twice and used my credit, when I told that to the personnel, he refused to check, redeemed one more wash from my bundle and when I tried to prove myself, was overall rude and yelled at me that it was “10 clients behind me”, after I stayed in line for 40 minutes. I really liked this wash before this incident< /review>

Overall was impressed with the wash. From out of state and did ultimate to clean up our car from driving on dirt roads and highways. Not familiar with this type of machine but was happy with how clean my car came out! Didn’t dry very well as I read on other reviews but it’s not the worst thing in the world. Went at 9:30am and nobody was there, took 10 min total with the ultimate wash.</Review>

Super friendly service from the cashier. Even has a personal brush and soak to put on tires and bumpers for those stubborn spots. Then also Very easy service and fast!</Text>

I paid for the best wash which was $13 paid $15 cash, machine instructed me to get my change at the front once done. Machine told me that it gave me some change (it didn't) so I was owed $1.50, checked couldn't count so he gave me $1.25... not cool. The wash was okay. But don't bother bringing non exact cash. Employees were also not wearing mask.

Good in a pinch! They don't really hand dry, so I wouldn't suggest for all the time. But if you park under a tree and get a tremendous amount of birds doing their business on your vehicle, this is a nice place to go to for a quick resolve! Lol< /review>

<Text>I have a full size car. The brushes didn't go down the rear window, which means the top of the trunk was also missed. The side mirrors were missed as well due to the way the brushes rotate. Drying leaves a lot of water.

I suggest coming back at a different time, if the car wash line extends past the car wash entrance. It will be a +25 minute wait.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Slowest car wash in history. Go here if you want to spend 45mins waiting in line. This is not an exaggeration.  I think they have the car wash to get customers to burn fuel, which they sell at the attached gas station!</Review>

Car wash paying slot is broken so you need to get code by pay in the store. I like the wash here as what I pay. I want them to fix vacuum though.
I smog check here too. No walk in but the owner arranged next day. Service man was very friendly and check was done in 10mins.
I drive middle suv and price was 35 al include.
Thank you</text>

<Review>They installed new equipment and raised standard wash to $9. I was satisfied with the wash, I did see some improvement.  It's not as good as a hand wash that gets all the small door glass but at half the cost and the time if it is not too busy.< /Review>< Pics>

I did not visit this place, but just want to make you aware of buying items on line from GBYGUESS according to my experience, bought item on line for a gift, when I opened the package item look like was already used for a party, make up stains, brilliant.
The worst, I still paid the return fee, deducted from my refund.
GBYGUESS just did not care, asked to waive return fee but They just ignore......< /Text>

Made the mistake of buying a shirt here thinking that it was actually Guess. Then made the second mistake of taking tag off when I was trying it in at home. Turns out their return policy doesn't allow returns or exchanges when the tag has been detached. Now I'm stuck with an overpriced shirt of poor quality. Caveat emptor indeed</Text>

And she took care of me throughout the process and checked on me regularly. She spoke to me about my spray tan color and after talking with me for a bit she suggested a color that would best suit my Vegas trip. I am in love with my color and her suggestion! Oh and the clothing they have there was a nice surprise too! Just check it out before you get sprayed.

<review>I've been going to Mist for about a year now and haven't had one bad experience. The tan always comes out flawless and all of their staff is extremely friendly and professional.Their new studio is in a great spot in Midtown with its own parking lot. Highly recommend to anyone!<//review>< username>

Megan is super professional, friendly and talented at her work - the entire experience was comfortable and her directions were clear and easy to follow. The color came out gorgeous and lasts well with proper care. Will definitely revisit and strongly recommend to anyone looking for a chic and satisfying spray tan experience.</Review>

<review>I had my first appointment with Mist Body Bar on 3/22/2021.
I had a great experience. I got a medium tan that turned out amazing! Love it! I also got my teeth whitened. my teeth changed 2 to 2.5 shades brighter within 30 mins. My teeth were a little sensitive that night and in the morning but feel normal now!
Meagan was the person who helped with my teeth whitening and body spray. I will be back in May after my five week Maui Trip!</review>< Time>

<text>They were careful and clean. Explained how to take care and manage the tan so I get maximum use out of it. Felt very comfortable and love my tan! It was exactly the pick me up you need in quarantine. They offer different shades depending on your skin tone. A person does it so you know the tan will be even.< /text><Date>1607116961159< /Date><user>115657689161942576573<//user><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

Meagan is fantastic! My spray tan turned out a beautiful color and was completely even, one of the best I’ve ever had! She really knows what she’s doing and the results were fantastic. Super wonderful and friendly too. I’ll be going back!</review>

I went to Mist for a spray tan and teeth whitening session for a friends wedding that I was in. My results were so perfect! I got lots of compliments on my tan. I plan on going back here before my own wedding next week! Even my fiance wants to come with me to get his teeth whitened!<//Text>

Great coverage and tan lasted 10 days without mottling and I am a senior with dry skin— followed her directions and would like to keep it up after the special event I got it for.  Would definitely recommend gift cards for family and friends!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Meagen and her team did an amazing job at making me feel comfortable. They throughly cleaned and sanitized before and after use of everything I touched. And as far as teeth whiting goes, WOW. I went like 4 shades whiter and my teeth don't hurt like they usually do after using crest strips. Success! I'll be back< /text>

She was so professional and even touched up my spray tan when i messes it up trying to get dressed. I am very fair toned, i do not tan even a little bit. I usually burn. She made my skin look so natural for my wedding. I will definitely be going back! 10/10 would recommend!!</Text>

Mist is the absolute best! I have loved all my results here and I have done teeth whitening and spray tanning. I entrusted Meagan to do my tan and teeth before my wedding and everything turned out perfect. The space is beautiful and Meagan is the nicest! You should definitely come here for your tanning needs!< /review>

The whole space was very clean and designed to perfection, it’s so cute! The spray tan was the most thorough I have ever gotten and Megan really took the time to get the color right and show me how to maintain it best. The last couple spray tans I have gotten elsewhere were either a little too light or too dark or just a hint of orange. This spray tan was 100% what I wanted, so even and natural looking. I will definitely be going back and recommend anyone in midtown to do the same!<//Review>

<text>LOVED my experience with Mist Body Bar. Was my first spray tan that I have ever gotten done that was not done by a machine or done with some self-tanner. The experience was so easy and I felt comfortable the whole time. My tan looks AMAZING and I can’t wait to go back to get a custom tan for my wedding. 10/10 recommend</text>< pics>

I booked a spray tan online just a couple days before my trip to Hawaii and it was super easy. I received a confirmation email with prep instructions and info about free parking near the salon. The salon is clean and adorable and conveniently located on J Street near the freeway. Meagan was super nice, made me feel comfortable, and told me about her products. She chose the appropriate shading for my skin color and I was thrilled with the results! I definitely recommend this salon, and I plan to come back for the spray tan and teeth whiting combo! Thanks, Meagan!!<//review>

Loved many things about this adorable spot! I was able to get an appointment for the next day, the service was absolutely quick yet thorough, and I was totally comfortable throughout the process. My tan is just the shade I was wanting - medium and even all around (since my arms were already tan). Also, the shop is SO cute, so I think this place deserves an extra star for its presentation.< /Review>

Meagan is so sweet, personable, and easy to talk to! She makes you feel super comfortable and makes sure you are happy with your spray tan before leaving! She also does the best spray tan I’ve probably ever had! It wasn’t streaky or orange looking, and it lasted longer than other spray tans I’ve had in the past. Such a good experience! I would definitely recommend Mist Body Bar to anyone!!</Text>

I did both the teeth whitening and the tan. Fantastic results on my teeth! (Improved 4 shades to the whitest!)
I had never done a spray tan done by a person (usually just do the booth), I was made to be very comfortable and love the tan.  Very even and natural looking. I will definitely be going back!</Review>

Best spray tan experience I’ve ever had. Meagan is super sweet, professional and very meticulous. The color turned out beautiful. I’m visiting family from out of town but this will definitely be my go to spot when visiting Sacramento!< /Review>

This is my favorite new place for spray tanning! I was going to Vegas and wanted some color on me. Meagen did an AMAZING job! She was super sweet and the next day I looked like I just got back from Maldives or something. The place is also super cute and cozy inside. Will be back for sure!</text>

The whole experience was great! Kristin was so sweet and made sure the room was warm for me during the spray tan. She also helped me pick a color level that would give me a natural looking tan. Highly recommend!< /review>

I feel so confident after getting a spray tan from Mist. The tan looks really natural, like I spent an afternoon in the sun. I got so many compliments after. They have a wide range of pigment levels and will recommend the perfect one based on your skin tone and how dark you want to go. Everyone is very professional and extremely friendly. They They always make me feel comfortable which can be tough when getting a spray tan.

They just moved into a new, larger space. It's clean,  comfortable, and looks awesome.< /Text>

My first time with a spray tan and Meagan made it so easy. I had to wear a slip dress, but I had some obvious sports bra tan lines she was able to blend in to match the rest of my body. It looked completely natural and I would definitely come back again !</Text>

My first spray tan experience ever and it was wonderful! I wanted to even out my horrendous farmer's tan so I decided to try them out on a whim after hearing many great things about Mist from my friends. I was seen by Nicole and she did a great job at keeping me at ease (since I was essentially a newbie at the time) and the results turned out great! No streaks, and very natural looking. I made sure to be prepared for my appointment, and read up on how to make my tan last long (they hand you instructions after you're done). I'd totally do it again for an event or to just even out my tan.<//review>

< Review>
Got my very first spray tan at Mist and I LOVED it!! I was nervous at first because I had some bad experiences with self tanner and wasn't sure how it would turn out on my VERY pale skin. I was also nervous about the idea of being completely naked in front of a stranger. Meagan at Mist was beyond great in every aspect. She not only made me feel comfortable, but she also provided me with all of the knowledge I needed to maintain my tan. Plus she is super nice too! The process was painless and once we got talking, I totally forgot about the fact I was so exposed. I was recommended Mist by 3 separate people, so to say it is the best place in town is an understatement! I would definitely go back.<//Review>

<Text>I’ve been a customer at Mist Body Bar for over a user now. They do a great job on their spray tans and have excellent customer service. The rams are always even and a beautiful color. They just moved to a new location that is convenient and has private parking in the back that makes it so nice.
The waiting room is spacious, light and welcoming. They have several tanning rooms. I really like the special where I can get teeth whitening and tanning spray on the same appointment. The teeth whitening is so nice because you really only need to do it once as opposed to getting those trays from your dentist. It takes less than an hour to do the teeth whitening and tanning in the same appointment. I highly recommend Mist Body Bar. You won’t be disappointed!<//Text>< Pictures>

love, love, LOVE my tan!!
Perfect color and well blended.  I couldn’t be happier with the service I received.  Clean space and super friendly owner and staff.

I appreciate the follow-up contact to see if I was completely satisfied after my shower and if I had any questions.

A very happy and satisfied customer!<//text>

<text>I found my new and permanent spray tan salon.  I had tried another salon on J street and did not have a good experience including the tan itself.
Mist Body Bar is clean, well organized and so welcoming.  I was nervous after my bad experience at Glow.  Eva was so reassuring and knowledgeable and attended to every detail.  She even noted my red tones and suggested a color combination that would tone it down a bit.  It did!  Her attention to detail was impressive and my resulting tan is beautiful.  I have already rebooked for my upcoming anniversary where I want to look spectacular.  I also had the opportunity to meet, Megan, who was equally impressive, professional and so kind. My next appointment is with her and I know it will meet all my expectations.  Now I’m excited about getting spray tans instead of apprehensive!<//text><UserId.>116005255475894915118<//UserId.><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<review>This is the best spray tanning salon in town. I’ve been going now for a couple years and love the all-natural look that lasts me about 10 days with the organic products.

I had the BEST experience at Mist yesterday. Eva did a great job of asking questions to pick the shade and tone for my skin. I went with a level 3 with green to minimize the red in my skin. The process was about 30 min and I felt comfortable. I can’t wait to use the lotion I picked up to keep my tan looking fresh.</text>

Cute and trendy looking spot — immediately loved it! Meagan was very professional and made me feel comfortable during the whole spray tan. Didn’t leave feeling sticky or smelly of product which is a major plus (& made my boyfriend happy ha!) :) can’t wait to show off my perfect tan in Sayulita this Holiday weekend. Definitely will be a returning customer for all my future events.<//text>

I am a returning customer, and I absolutely love the new location, they have parking (metered before 6) in the front but parking in the back behind the building. The neighborhood is super safe and the building is fresh and clean. Megan did my spray tan and as always it looks amazing!  I tan in my panties only and both girls make you feel comfortable so it’s not awkward at all. What I like the most is that if you are ever dissatisfied with your tan, they will make it right. It’s all about customer service for Mist. If your looking for a great tan that looks natural, go to Mist, and nowhere else! I do the monthly tanning package so my tan looks fresh every week. It’s worth every dime!!!<//review>

<review>Meagen does a wonderful job. My tan is even and looks great. I can't say how long it last because I am only on day two. I also did the teeth whitening and that was good as well.</review>< GmapID>

<Text>As a frequent spray tanner this is the place I go when I want to guarantee I look good. The color is even and natural not to mention the smell is 100 better than the solutions at automatic spray booths. The price is higher than places like California Sun but the results and experience are totally worth it. There is a reason the just moved to a bigger space!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809ad0c520517a35:0xb0e358c921d215f6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Meagen is so wonderful and I felt instantly comfortable in her hands. It was my first time getting a professional spray tan and she was knowledgeable and informative about every step of the process. I went with a level three for my tan I’m I’m pretty stoked about the results! I will be going back and telling all my friends!</Text>

< Review>
THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR SPRAY TANS IN SACRAMENTO! I have been to Mist for a few spray tans and I am always happy with the result. Wonderful color that really lasts. They really take their time to customize the color and throughly spray you. I have never had a streak or come out "orange." I have recommended to all my friends- would totally trust them with a pre wedding tan! This is the only place I would go to for a spay tan in Sac. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!< /Review>

<Review>I’ve been going to Mist for a few years now. While I can only prioritize air brush for special occasions- I wouldn’t go to anyone else! Meagen customizes the formula to your skin type every time. She does an amazing job making you feel very comfortable and relaxed during the whole process and I have never had anything less than a perfect result! It’s been a little over 24 hours and I have received amazing compliments and questions about my tan already. Thank you Meagen!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Best air brush spray I’ve had. The formula color looks so natural and is customizable. There is no spray tan smell after wards either. It gave me an instant confidence boost, I will definitely be back. Meagen is great too, she makes you feel comfortable and does a very good, detail oriented job!</review>

<review>Megan is wonderful for starters. Very friendly and knowlegable. I am a larger lady but I felt very comfortable there. I've used another airbrush tanner but Megan is hands down better than others.  She takes her time to make sure she does her best job. She has a very appealing and informative webiste. I wasn't getting tanned for any special occasion but you can bet Ill use her for any and all occasions from here on out!< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><username>Katie Gaines DeAngelis< /username><user>110689718943286643294<//user><Text>Mist Body Bar has been such a great experience, I’ve been a couple of times now and am so happy with the results. The days of the obvious fake tan are over and it lasts longer than you’d think! It’s an even tan to your liking and my hands/feet are never “over saturated” which is always the dead giveaway. I’d recommend this place over any other I’ve gone to in the area. Such a great pit stop before a special occasion or vacation. They make the experience quick, provide quality results and are very warm and welcoming! If you want a reliable go-to spot this is your jam, they are good.

If you want an actual horror story, read on...
My sister didn’t have time to get to Mist Body bar and went elsewhere the same day I went. All I can say is she learned her lesson. We’re laughing now but she has to live with an orange tint for the next week-ish,so ya. Her tan was less than $10 cheaper and it looks like she literally was spattered with carrot juice/bbq sauce, you get the picture. All I’m saying is Mist is reliable, don’t risk it.<//Text></record>

I looked amazing! Everybody swore I lost 20 lbs.  For 3-4 days.  It was my first Application.... and I went to a warm beach.. so the sweat leeched the color out of my skin (and i stayed out of the water like blondie told me).  It did look natural though.  The application process  was slightly uncomfortable, but then,  isn't beauty worth suffering for?
The owner was very friendly and made me feel comfortable while I was in a slightly compromised position.< /Text>

I needed to be tan for an event and Meagen was able to fit me in even though I was super last-minute. She is the sweetest thing and made the experience a lot of fun. The tan looked great and lasted a lot longer than I thought it would! If you need a tan, you should definitely visit Meagen at Mist!<//Review>

If there is anyone you want a tan from I think it would be Meagan at Mist.  She is the best in my opinion.  And she makes awesome candles.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Meagen is amazing! I had her come to my house as part of her great mobile service. So easy and convenient for me since you're always slightly sticky after getting sprayed and you don't have to deal with getting in a car, driving, etc afterwards. The tan looked great - nice and even and not too or orange. Completely natural. In addition Meagen made me feel super comfortable and made what is normally a boring errand, fun! I will definitely use her service again.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Had my teeth whitened for pictures (I drink a lot of coffee and had some yellowing showing on my teeth) and it came out very natural and they look great now</Review>

Made an appointment to get my son a haircut 💇, when we arrived the hairstylist was giving a kid a haircut that looked like a horrible Mohawk, the kid kept on telling the hairstylist to stop and she kept on going not listing to him claiming that it takes time to give someone a fade, he clearly looked uncomfortable and she continue giving him attitude, I decided to walk out and and don’t recommend this place to anyone, the hairstylist has a bad attitude and lack of professionalism.<//Review>

My hat is off to Sandra best hair cut I’ve ever had. I’m 45 years old and been all over looking for a good barber my search is over. I’ve been here befor in the past and wasn’t happy with the customer service. She made the difference I will be going back. Thanks Sandra see you soon.<//Text>

This place is amazing!! She (can’t remember her name) is the first person to EVER find a cut and style for my husbands hair that works with how his hair naturally goes, AND looks great for his head shape.
She also tamed and showed him how to maintain his unruly beard.
This is going to be his regular shop now! Thank you SoltArt!!!</review>

Soly is awesome.  Place is clean and comfortable with a hint of classic barbershop.  No appointments, so sometimes there's a wait. But it's worth it.<//Review>

< Review>
We had a mishap with uhaul and needed to find a functional storage option on a moments notice. When we arrived at the location we had been driving for two days, had a moving truck a dog and 2 kids in tow and everyone was stressed. Ramon got us set up with what we needed and made it a super easy seamless process. The facility is well maintained, you can tell they keep it clean, follow COVID protocols, they walk around and check on things, the cameras and gates and such are all in great working order. Definitely glad with the turn of events we ended up with our storage here.</Review>

< Review>
I've used Public Storage areas of and on for 30 years with mixed experience this is by far the best Public Storage unit I've ever dealt with, from walking me to my unit helping me with the finicky lock the attendant on duty Arizona was great. The manager Ramon help me with the Public storage app and helped me secure another unit close to my other unit. Even the regional manager Don Silvano helped me out with an old charge on my account. I own a surf shop in San Rafael called 101 Surf Sports we pride ourselves with customer service, so many business do not. However this particular Public Storage totally gets the concept. I highly recommend them. Cort Larned Partner 101 Surf Sports< /Review>

If I could give this place -100 stars I would.  They had painters here working for the last month.  They painted the inside and outside of the buildings.  The storage unit I have is a rectangle closet at the end of the hall and has about a 6 inch gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling.  I was at my unit about a month ago putting some things inside, everything was fine then.  Since there were painters everywhere I decided to come back since there was all this work being done.  I came back on Sunday, April 18th to find that when the work had been done all of this paint dust or whatever it is, blew in from the top of my unit and covered all of my belongings.  I have a 2 bed room apartment in there. Everything I own. Everything.  Some of my stuff is bagged and stored but somethings like camp gear (tents, sleeping pads, etc) are not because I take that stuff out from spring to fall.  I went to talk to the person in the office, who I'm guessing is Ramon since that's what other reviews say, and he was the most unprofessional person I have EVER had to deal with.  He said,"  Do you have insurance??"  I said, "Yes." He then says, "you have to contact your insurance."  and that was it.  So I don't understand how everyone is talking about this guy being helpful or even good at customer service.  I turn around go back to my car drive over to my unit get on the phone with insurance, file a claim and Ramon comes up to my car after I've already been on the phone for at least 5 minutes and finally offers some customer service while trying to give me a brochure to contact the insurance company.  Look, I wouldn't be so upset if he had shown some empathy and compassion for my belongings being ruined. Absolutely no apology that that had happened or anything even though it was most certainly their fault.  On top of it all this guy is the property manager.  So all these reviews saying this guy is great are either lying or caught him on a good day.  Its also not my first time dealing with him.  He chased me and my boyfriend down yelling at him cause he didn't put the code in to drive through the gate because there was a person in front of us.  Yeah I know you're supposed to do that, he didn't know and you don't need to yell at people.  You work at a storage facility and furthermore I rent a unit here.  I'm not some person who wandered on the property.  I deal with customers all day long in Marin and I don't talk to people that way.  The insurance lady said I may not even be covered.  So now I get to waste my time pulling all my stuff out getting it cleaned (I do not have a washer and dryer, I go to the laundromat) spend money to clean everything and sweep the unit so that I even feel comfortable keeping my stuff in that dirty unit.  I basically paid these people to ruin my stuff.  As soon as this is over I will move my things somewhere else.  Worst storage place I have ever had.

Edit: after I posted this review, I was contacted by a regional manager. Who apologized and mentioned he could maybe get a credit for me. Never heard anything and they just raised my rent $36/month. Also the insurance company that insures you is trash. Can’t wait to get my stuff out of here. I find it absolutely insulting that they “regret” I’m not satisfied? You got paint overspray on my personal items and did nothing about it except raise my rent and had to get an apology from a regional manager and not even the property manager.<//text>

Most recently I sold my house and downsized and had to rent storage space. I have spent a lot of time there sorting and moving out things. The manager Roman, as well as his staff, have been helpful, friendly, reliable and conscientious. I am was there often during early and late hours and Roman would check on me. You can count on him to follow up on what he says and I always feel safe at this location. It is clean and well maintained and so I keep coming back to it.<//text>< pics>

Today I showed up at 6:20am to get my tools for work.  Only to find a sign on the gate stating that the gate is out of order and I can't get access to my storage unit until 9:30am. It would have been nice to get a email about this since I noticed that the gate didn't work and was open last Friday. Public storage has no problem sending me a email concerning my bill weeks before it's due but I have to find out Monday morning at 6:20 am I don't have access to the storage unit I pay for.</review>

Terrible customer service and unannounced rate increases. The manager has repeatedly treated me rudely and raised his voice to me multiple times. These days I only do business with reasonable businesses. This policy tells me they do not care about their customers. Never again Public Storage!< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>While moving from San Diego back to the Bay Area, I needed an intermediary space to house my belongings before I move yet again to San Rafael. I tried the storage space across the railroad tracks from here only to find they had no push cart or dolly and gravel pathways, which isn’t suitable for maneuvering large furniture and boxes through. I called Public Storage and Ramon took care of both my stressed out self and friend with professionalism and ease. Though they were more expensive, the accommodations of smooth paved pathways, push carts, elevator and security made the price worth the investment.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
My family has rented a unit from this location for many years.  We trust the location and have always felt our belongings are stored safely and securely.  This year we experienced the loss of our Dad and as the unit was legally in his name, it took some time for me (his daughter and the owner of most of the stored items) to gain access to the unit.  After obtaining the appropriate documents, all is well. During this time, two employees were wonderful in assisting me: Ramon and Noelle.   Ramon has been extremely friendly, patient and very kind during this difficult time for me.  He is a great asset to Public Storage and I really want to thank him for all his help!</review>

Clean, light & spacious buildings, with gate security and cameras.  The units are reasonably priced, and most are accessible from ground level or in some cases upstairs via a large elevator.  There are dollies for general use to move your stuff, and corridor access is adequate.  In general, with the manager onsite it feels pretty safe and secure, and a little less depressing than some storage units.</Text>

Don't really understand all of the positive reviews.  Rent increases significantly after 90 days, my unit had rainwater intrusion for over 1 year, and the staff just claims "corporate" is responsible for all of the poor conditions.  PS is a very large but poor operator in the self storage arena.< /review>

Ramon, the on-site manager, was awesome. Public Storage not so awesome. Within 6 months they raised the rate on our 10x10 from $185 to $320 while advertising online the same space for $145. They declined to keep our rate at $185 so we moved out. Beware the move-in rate is not your real rate!< /Text>

This storage location is great, clean and just a minute away from freeway exit.
Manager (Joe) is great - he is very responsive to requests, calls, questions, whatever it is. I called on Saturday and was able to get my account setup and have keys within the next few hours. I called a few other locations and companies prior to this one, and I'm happy I did the right choice. I would recommend this to anyone to appreciates convenience and excellent customer service.<//Text>

Lisa and the gentleman who work there are sooo accommodating.  One morning I showed up before the office had opened and Lisa still offered me access to the large dolly.  As crunched for time as I was that week, her kindness made a big difference in my day.  It's this kind of service that distinguishes this site from the competition.  Great experience, best I've had at a Public Storage to date!<//text>

<text>Just this week we rented a 10 X 20 unit. It was all last minute and rushed.
Meeting Joe at the counter was a relief. His easy going manner had the immediate
effect of relaxing me and taking  some of the stress I was feeling away. We reviewed
all options and easily came to a good decision based upon our storage needs.Joe's easy going good nature, professionalism and efficiency made the whole process
a great experience.</text><UserId.>108443606394676431938< /UserId.><date>1409510888928</date>< pics>

<text>This Public Storage facility was terrific and suited our needs perfectly as a temporary storage facility.  Marshall and Lisa were both very helpful and courteous.  They even would make a courtesy call to make sure that we were not charged a late fee.  Thank you!<//text></record>

< Review>
Recently, I came to Public Storage to inquire about rental rates. The on-site manager Joe was helpful to describe to me the different rates with such strong knowledge and professionalism. I was definitely impressed. Even though, my inquiry was for a future storage unit rental purchase, Joe answered all my questions and gave me great comfort that when I was finally ready to rent a space, it would be a smooth transition for me and my boyfriend to move our belongings into a P.S. unit.</Review>

<Review>I had the pleasure of being helped by Marshel. It was 5 minutes to 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon when I remembered; I needed to pay my storage before I incurred a late charge. I was minutes away from his facility, called in a panic, explained my situation and he was so nice to wait for me to get there. He was so pleasant and patient. Thanks Marshel!!!!!!<//Review><user_id>107568075888191419768</user_id>< GmapID>

Every time I come to pay a bill this place is closed and the return time is more than an hour away. Last time i actually made it inside the office, it reeked of cigarette smoke. There's so many other public storages in the area, i do not recommend coming to this one.<//Text>

<Text>Joe was the best! He called me during my move to let me know that the elevator onsite had broken down. Knowing this, he re-selected a different, upstairs unit for me that was right by the stairs door instead of the original one at the back of the building. Because of Joe, I was able to avoid the extremely last-minute hassle of finding a different storage company due to the elevator. We were able to move everything up the one, short flight of stairs to the top. I highly recommend this location; the customer service was beyond excellent!<//Text>< user_id>

my day started a little rocky, I was stressing out and trying to get more stuff into my unit.  Luckily Arthur was there and totally turned my day around.  He was so helpful, friendly and kind.  Funny how people can turn around your day, you know?

Anyone looking for storage units come here........  The property is always clean, I feel safe and confident leaving my belongings here; and there is always someone that's more then happy to help ya out. : )<//Text>

Two things I don't like is how creepy the two story building is when walking to your storage unit.. lol and the build up of trash around the facility. Place needs trash cans. Elevator works great with a button to keep doors open while loading/unloading.</Text>

I wish the city would update this park with a decent playground. It could be very nice, but now, it's just a couple of climbing rocks and swings in need of repair. I think our neighborhood deserves a nicer playground like the rest of the playgrounds that seem to be getting updated elsewhere in the city.</text>

Love the meadows and paved and unpaved paths. Noticeable new saplings seem to flourish and a great place to go with the dogs. One of my favorite spots walking amongst the oaks on a cool morning.< /Review>

Not very large but very pretty.  Many benches to sit on.  In the center children can play in the sand.  Also, a short trail that leads into the woodsy area for bikes, runners, dogs on leashes and people going for a leisurely walk.< /review>

Beautiful. Love the way the parks link together. Vernal pools is amazing right now. Turkeys were in rare form. Share the path signs are everywhere with designated walking or biking paths. Functional and very natural.</text>

<text>The gateway to this park includes a nice little playground, picnic area, and 1/2 basketball court.  Paved and dirt paths lead further into oak forests and open grass fields.  A good place to walk a dog or to allow kids to explore nature.<//text>< Pictures>

Great place to explore in Roseville, especially in the spring. Wildflower blooms, vernal pools and a variety of wildlife. Paved hiking and biking trails in addition to some peaceful dirt trails.</text>

I have a lot of confidence that my vehicle will be done properly. No problem there. But the last time, other work was done without given a call and the bill was larger than anticipated. I’m sure the work needed to be done. Not the point.< /text>

These people are the best at serving their customers. I had a nail in my tire drove in without an appt and they repaired it while I waited. This isn't the first time they have helped me out. They're the best!</Review>

I'd been going elsewhere for my regular automotive maintenance and repair needs. But when the staffing at my usual shop changed for the worse, I gave Robert Hahn's a try. The staff here is great—friendly, informative, and helpful. They even offered to show me how to replace a part on my own so that I wouldn't have to pay them for labor next time around. Also, after giving me a quote for several items, they took no issue with adjusting the quote after I told them I'd done some of the work myself. I'm looking forward to doing business with them again.</review>

We take our cars to Robert Hahn for all repairs and services needed. They never up sale us, they tell us what is wrong and the cost. The repair costs are very reasonable and the work is done professionally. You never have to take your car back for something they have repaired. Friendly people makes dealing with them enjoyable.<//review>

<text>I'm so excited I found this shop. Dropped my car off today and met Alex. Absolutely the best service, customer service and experience I've ever had at a shop. I will now bring all my cars to Alex. He is extremely professional but even more knowledgeable. Immediately you feel your car is in the right hands. Do yourself a favor and do business with Alex.< /text>< Pics>

They have always treated me respectfully and completed my repairs  within the time they stated. I have been going to them for years and would not think of taking my car anywhere else. The women in the office are very knowledgeable and friendly.<//Review>

Great service and friendly people.
Did the job right without trying to upsale me. Just recommended the parts needed to get my car fixed. I would recommend this shop to my friends and family.< /Text>

<review>The Hahn's had good reviews, but my experience with them was horrible. I had called them on a Tuesday to schedule bringing my truck into the shop. I dropped it off on Friday at noon and was told they would call me with an estimate. There was no call on Friday. I didn't receive a call on Monday either. I called them on Monday, but got their machine as it was after they had closed for the day. I called them Tuesday at around 10:00 am, and they told me they had not even looked at my truck yet as they had lost a mechanic, but would later in the day. By the end of the day I had still not heard from them and I called again. They still hadn't looked at my truck, but said they would the next day. I still had not heard from them by the end of the day on Wednesday, and when I called them they informed me they STILL had not looked at my truck. I asked for a manager and wanted to know how many cars were ahead of mine. They apologized and said they wouldn't actually get to my truck until until Monday. However, if that was too long they were willing to send my truck to a nearby gas station that had a mechanic. This is NOT the customer service of the supposedly best service facility in Amador county. Not one time did their facility call me. I had to call them every time, and whenever speaking with them I treated them with the utmost respect (I'm not one of those customers who acts like a jerk), even though by Wednesday afternoon I was very frustrated. So, beware their good reviews. It is absolutely inexcusable that they would have you drop your vehicle off and not be able to even look at it for over a week.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>I have been using the services at Hahn's for many years and have never been disapointed by them.  Repairs are done right the first time, vehicle is ready when promised and the staff is most helpful.< /Review>< pictures>

Lots of empty promises, and a very rude women working the counter. They could not find what was wrong with my vehicle so they diverted it to an unrelated issues and tried to  charge me for tme for that instead without my permission. When I stated that I wanted to  not get that addresses at the moment and only wanted to pay my diagnosis fee, the women in the front gage a heavily passive agrees I've sigh and stated she didn't want my money. Not sure what the issue was but we were trying to get something else fixed.< /Text>

the staff was great and they got my engine done fast and right so the service was good too but come on guys we brought all the parts to u but u guys charged us $22 for silicone to put my timing cover on and we all know you guys didnt even use half a tube and the tube of black rtv retail is only $5.00 so for $2.50 of black rtv u charged us $22 so needless to say we will not be using u guys no more and we will not recomend u to anyone we know so we hope you like that extra $22 u reamed us for cause it costed u our business</Text>

I ordered a super El Pastor burrito , wifey ordered a Chimichanga and pops ordered a super quesadilla. + 2 fountain passion fruit drinks and a Mexican soda. The guy at the counter said to pay when the food was ready “did not give us a total” and it would take 15-20 minutes. What?, their was only one guy a head of us who had already place his order?  I’ve herd of slow service but this takes the cake. Fast forward 20 minutes.... foods ready that will be $62.80, what?!! Talk about sticker shock!! We  begrudgingly paid and walked out .
Food items as fallows 1. Jarritos soda $3.00
1 super burrito $13.50
2 Maracuya drinks $8.00
1 chimichanga $17.99
1 Quesadillia $14.99
Tax $5.32
After we opened our bags I realized that they gave us 2 meal plates  “which I clearly did not order”  if he was not sure “he should have asked!!”
So far 0 star!!
Now for the food, The quesadilla was big and pops liked it, The chimichanga was small and wifey said it was OK. My El Pastor burrito was big but had 0 flavor, the meat was hard and chewy, hands-down the worst El Pastore burrito I’ve ever had.
Bottom line; poor Communication, the food is substandard and the drinks tasted like powder drinks, for the price we paid, will not be going back.<//Review>< pictures>

So delicious I started eating before remembering to take a picture. I called in a takeout order September 2020 (so we were under shelter restrictions) and was pleased with the portion size and time until the order was ready.

If my picture shows, this is a chicken tamale with rice and beans. The rice was super delicious! Unlike at other places, the rice here was a star in its own right. I was glad I got talked into making this a combo.<//Review>

<review>Friendly service, free chips, great pupusas, will come back for either more pupusas or to try other things.

I liked the cheese and loroco pupusa more than the pork and cheese... enough that I'd probably get two loroco than one of each if I was getting two.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Their fresh hand made tortillas are the best. Combine them with their bomb aztec shrimp (bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cheese and jalapeños) to have best time of your life.<//Text>

Food was so good!! We had the fish and the seafood soup - both popular Honduran dishes - says the waiter! The tortillas are all home made too, so must get with your meal. We want to try the fried chicken dish next! We were greeted by the staff as we walked in, felt a very authentic and family-community vibe which we enjoyed!< /review>

We only live mile away yet never ate here. Someone told my friend about it. Place was packed but had a few open tables. That way the whole time we were there. Also, people of all ethnic backgrounds. We knew it had to be good. It was better, it was excellent. I had the chili verde, my favorite Mexican dish. Might be the best I've ever had. Big chunks of tender pork, in an amazing sauce.<//Review>

My daughter introduced us to Maya's. She and her friends come here a lot.  This was my first *real* introduction to Honduran food although I've tried a random PUPUSA somewhere once before.

We strolled in on a lazy Saturday afternoon around 3:00 and was surprised to find nearly all the tables full - party atmosphere, loud music and everyone tight around their tables enjoying their food.  ..."Wait, what time is it again?"

The bottled beer was ice cold - that was such a good start.
Thank you Maya for knowing that serving beer less than freezing cold is not an option!

Service was a bit sketchy, not much interaction beyond the order, the food delivery and the check. But it was one server for all of us, so let's give her a break.

FRIED CHICKEN (5/5) Who orders Fried Chicken at a Mexican/Honduran restaurant?  I guess I do now.  As I was scrolling through Yelp photos of this place, the pictures of the Fried Chicken were reeeaaaally calling my name.  You have a choice of leg or breast and we went for the breast.  It was humongous.  It comes with a red dipping sauce that was really perfect.  I had such a wonderful time tearing apart the chicken - especially the crispy skin - and dipping it in the sauce.  I will go back for that chicken, and that day might be tomorrow.  Loved the chicken.

HABANERO SAUCE (5/5)  Yes, I'm listing a condiment and rating it as a main dish.  You'll find this sauce in one of those lovely plastic squeeze containers on your table.  I L O V E D this authentically HOT sauce. It was everything - such a great compliment to the meal.  I will go back for this sauce and I think a lot of people are doing the same thing, given the fullness of the restaurant at 3:00 in the afternoon.  This sauce should get promoted to a soup!  :)

BALEADA (5/5) A baleada (BAH-lay-ah-dah) is a Honduran quesadilla.  Honduran street food apparently. There are many variations, but Maya's version had re-fried beans, some cheese and maybe a secret sauce of some kind.  It didn't look like much, but it was very tasty and hard to stop eating.

PUPUSA (4/5)  These happy little discs remind me of tamales - think of them as round tamales but without the wrapper.  These were good too.  Again, presentation wasn't much, but they delivered on taste for sure.

Maya's is an excellent find, no doubt.  Clearly there are many others that found it way before me, but hey, I'm only one person trying to get around to over a thousand bookmarked restaurants.  What really thrills me, is that Maya's is just up the street from our new house that we're moving into very soon.  Which means - I'll be here like every other day.  Such happy thoughts!

Try this place for sure - unpretentious and sort of rough around the edges, but the food is undeniably good.<//Text>

Get the fried chicken. Now, I know you're thinking, "From a Honduran spot, really?" Yes, really. Great service and a smaller spot, so you get a good personal touch from the staff.</Review>

It was my first time trying Honduran food and boy was it good. Maya's cafe is a gem tucked away in the plaza across the street from Lunardi's. The food is authentic and fresh! I especially loved the homemade tortillas. When you try one of these, you'll wonder why you always order the premade ones. You can't go wrong with pairing a fresh tortilla with the barbacoa entree. Can't wait to come back for more!<//review>

<text>Food is good. Service is above average. The only gripe I have with this place is the time it takes to place an order and then wait for the food to come out. There are times where this place can be crowded and every single table is filled and times where this place is empty. The staff is very friendly and easy to talk to.</text>< Pictures>

One of our favorite local South American restaurant. It's really easy to miss the little strip where it's located but when you go in the atmosphere is relaxed and the food is just delicious.
They have a seafood soup to die for...</review>

When we arrived they said 15 minutes and that's OK, but as we waited this one family went passed us and went straight with the owner who's name is Willie and they got our table, so what does that mean? That if you know the owner you get the table. You might say how we knew, well we were inside and spoke with him my his first name and and then one big hug. For this reason we will not go back. I was going to speak with Willie but really it is just a waste of time. Drive all the way there wait in line and then this happens.</Review>

<Review>I love food. I especially love central and south american food. While Maya's had a lot of options and a lot of diversity, it lacked a memorable flavor and did not impress my date, who is Honduran and grew up eating variations of some of the menu items. The management is really nice and accommodating, but the food just didn't hit the spot. Will try again.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<time>1491414462410<//time><rate>4<//rate><Text>This is not on the menu.  They made it special for me.  I was in heaven. They have an incredible simply-made fillet of sole and cooked it to perfection, melt in your mouth.  I had it with beans, rice and lettuce.  It was 5 stars. I will be back for this again and again.  The next time I came I tried the beef.  It was so tough and I am talking gristle here.  I don't recommend it.  The hibiscus drink is light and cooling.  Highly recommend trying it.  If you are looking for a quiet date romantic night, forget it.  It's a loud bar sort of place if you come after 7:00  in the evening. Think diner. If you are in a hurry, forget it. The service is the best they can do but with one cook and one server and multiply by many customers, expect a wait. Best time to go is 5:30- 6:30.  The crowd starts at 7:00 and we get fast service by going early at 5;30.Fridays and weekends expect a wait for a table if you come after 6:30/7:00  Homemade tortillas warm from the grill alone make this a dinning treat.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We dine here once every week or so, usually take-home.

The food is good, everything we try.

And the staff and owner are all very pleasant.

Great food and friendly staff.
Our go tos are the Honduran style carne asada, camarones aztecas and the papusas.
Their sopas, pollo frito and fajitas are also good. Their corn tortillas are delicious as well.</Text>

<Text>Let’s get a couple things out of the way first: Maya’s is a family run place that’s very small and usually very crowded. It takes some time. Set your expectations accordingly that you might need to wait, bringing a group bigger than 4 could be a challenge, and it probably won’t be a quick meal.

It’s usually very crowded because this is the best restaurant in San Jose. Their tortillas will ruin other places forever. The chili verde is sublimely spicy and my most favorite item on the menu, but so many other adventures await you. The Barbacoa, Pollo Frito, Sopa de Mariscos, and many other items are all just fantastic. Discover your own favorite<//Text>< UserId.>

I like to be honest. The service at first was great, and then they took forever to bring our food. Only two costumers and they already had their food. Okay, and to top it off they charge me $24 dollars for six pupusas! And I didn't even order a drink. What the heck!!! I ask them for Revueltas, and the bring me only Chicharon. Come on guy's pay attention to the costumers orders.</text>

<text>Maya's has quickly become my favorite go to restaurant. My wife and I eat here at least once a week.

The food quality is exceptional and consistent. I'm not usually one to try new items, usually sticking to Carnitas or Carne Azada, but seeing the amazing looking food coming from the kitchen inspired me to try their pescado frito, Baleada, and Pupusa for the first time. I don't know why I didn't try them earlier, I've been missing out!< /text><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x808e34f0dd040ba9:0x8589ebb7291be29c<//Gmap_id>< userid>

Maya's Cafe is one of my very favorite restaurants! I crave their coconut seafood soup. The broth is so flavorful with the sweet and savory coconut milk, an array of seafood and plantains. The seafood is a combination of shrimp, crab legs, fish filet, mussels in the shell. All topped with chopped cilantro, with a side of rice. This is one of their deliteful Honduran dishes. My daughter had the carnitas fajitas. The pork was so flavorful! The tortillas are house made both flour and corn. They would be delicious even on their own. My husband had the Caldo, de Rez, a very flavorful, hearty beef and vegetable soup with tender fall off the bone beef, veggies and yucca.
Hmmm, even the chips and salsa are tasty! The menu is quite large with many Honduran and Mexican specialties.
This is a small family run restaurant. Everything is made fresh to order.
The service is great and friendly. I am looking forward to many more visits!!< /text>

<text>Just stopped in while traveling for work and absolutely loved this place - the food, atmosphere, and service. These guys will take care of you and make sure you're welcomed. I ordered the Chile Verde with a Papusa and nachos. Verde was the best I've had and the Papusa was poppin'. The tortillas are fresh and homemade. Our waiter recommended the banana soda, which was fantastic. Honestly, I enjoyed every bite of my meal.

If you are in the area and looking for good food, you need to stop by.< /text>< Pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>The place was quaint, I liked how they had 3 TVs in each corner of their space, two and a half men reruns. I ordered the super burrito with Carne asada - I have to say it was pretty good except a few minor things... The steak wasn't cut all the way, It was connected with the fatty ligaments... This made the burrito hard to eat as the meat came out all in one bite. This place has very friendly service and karaoke on the weekends.<//text>< pictures>

Great for an affordable, delicious bite and great service. Their steak fajitas, flour tortillas, and guac are highlights on the menu.</review>

Staff was friendly.  The problem was when I ordered  some cheese and bean pupusas and the pupusas were dry, and the only thing I tasted was the corn flour. No cheese or bean inside.
My wife ordered a some  eggs with tomatoe sauce, but the I saw that the eggs were swimming in the sauce. Not very yummy. Not going again to this place.< /text>

Most the servers will ignore you after you ask them for menu or try to order. We end up sitting there for 30 minutes without people taking our order.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Well I had another opinion but now I just tried the chickens that I went to buy at this time and I am sorry I promise 😤the chicken without flavor totally simple, the slices not the most toasted slices they could not make, and apart at least 2 bananas I mean bananas like We say in Honduras and the simple sauce, the onion, no way, and the price of the chickens for what it brings, no, I make them better .... it's all thanks 😤😤😤

(Original)
Bueno tenía otra opinión pero ahora justo probé los pollos que fuí a comprar en este momento y estoy arrepentida lo prometo 😤el pollo sin sabor totalmente siiimpleee, las tajadas noo las tajadas más tostadas no las pudieron hacer, y aparte mínimo 2 plátanos osea guineos como le decimos en Honduras y  la salsa simple la cebolla ni hablar en fin😏 y el precio de los pollos para lo que trae noo mejor los hago yo....es todo gracias 😤😤😤< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) They take a long time to attend and besides the place is super small but the worst thing is the personal treatment they always look at us and treat us in a bad way as if our money was not worth or that place was exclusive to Hondurans ... I say why one can eat food from wherever..

(Original)
