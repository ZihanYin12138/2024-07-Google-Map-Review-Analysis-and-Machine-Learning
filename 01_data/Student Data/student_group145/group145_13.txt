< Review>
I got my tattoo done by James Tran! I am absolutely in love with his artwork and can’t thank him enough for the amazing job he did. I follow his Instagram and knew how talented and skilled he is but wow he exceeded my expectations! The studio was clean and everyone there was nice! Highly recommend this place.< /Review>

Great shop! Artists are pleasant to work with and they are reasonably priced (especially compared to some other shops in San Diego).< /Review>

I'm writing this review for DAVE. He's one of those humble tattoo artists that listens and really makes sure you get exactly what you ask for, with a touch of his craft and shading that is true art. He's my go to for just about any style and he's THE BEST finger tattoo artist I've ever seen. Thanks Dave, see you soon!< /Review>

Great shop. Friendly people and great artists. I was recommended this shop and was definitely not disappointment. Michelle is amazing work and was very friendly and warm. I’m happy with the results and I’ll definitely be back once I’m ready for more. Walked in at 2pm and got an appointment for 4:30 which worked out perfectly for me.< /Review>

They are very professional and I look forward to recommending to anyone in search of some ink. It matters who gives you a tattoo, right? This place never fails. Take a look, chat with the artists, book a session. You'll be happy.</Text><rating>5< /rating>< GmapID>

These guys are literally amazing! So friendly and professional. The shop manager is one of the nicest people. They really care about the work that comes out of the shop and take all the time to make sure it’s perfect.

They have some extremely talented people in this shop! I’d highly recommend all and any of the artist in Full Circle!< /text>

<Review>Had a great experience at this shop. Tracy Martino was who I went to see for my piece and he was super accommodating with the sketch and my timeframe. I felt that I got everything I asked for in the piece, which was very difficult in the space I chose (neck). Couldn't have come out better. A super vibrant, detailed, and colourful tattoo that gets plenty of awesome compliments!

Thanks so much Tracy!< /Review>< response>

<response>{'time': 1559787338169, 'text': 'Amy,\n\nI’ve been expecting this review honestly. I informed you when you arrived there was one small tattoo in front of you, and that Dominic would then finish your design and go over it with you. Your tattoo was not a small and simple design, so took some effort to draw. The other two walk ins who came in were extremely simple, and another artist who happened to be free took care of them while your tattoo was already in the design process. They had no bearing on your place in line.\n\nWhen he came up front with his initial ideas you were distracted on a phone call and only asked for minor changes. After he made those changes you then added more. He consulted with you multiple times and added all the elements you asked for. When he came out with the final design you were gone.\n\nWe close at 5pm on Sundays, which means our artist stayed almost two hours late just to redesign this tattoo to your liking, and instead of simply asking us about any concerns you had, you left. This is the exact reason why we require a deposit, as you ended up wasting almost two hours of our time.\n\nWe would have been more than happy to sit down with you further, or even use your deposit toward an appointment so we would have more time to work on the ideas. If you were feeling anxious about the process or the tattoo, all you had to do was let us know and we would have found a way to work it out with you.\n\nTo instead leave without attempting to make your feelings known is both rude and insensitive to the effort put into making a good tattoo for you.'}< /response><review>I went in for a walk-in and was recommended this shop and a specific artist. So I was feeling pretty hopeful about this shop. My appointment time was 4pm. I had to wait there over an hour before the artist showed me the tattoo that he drew up (5:20pm). The tattoo didn’t have as much detail that I wanted it to have. So I asked him to make a few changes. It was already 6:20pm and it felt like I wasn’t included in the tattoo process at all. I had been waiting almost 2 1/2 hours and my anxiety was really bad so I decided to leave. I’ve done 2 walk ins before and never had to wait anymore than 20 minutes. I had watched 2 other walk ins come in and get their tattoo and leave in the time I was waiting. I had to put 100$ deposit which is unfortunate considering I didn’t get a tattoo. I had really high hopes for this shop and was really excited. The customer service was just really bad and I had a pretty bad experience over all<//review>< user>

<text>James was awesome. I saw him a couple weeks ago to get my first visible tattoo, he made me feel welcome and at ease. He was pleasant and friendly while being completely professional. Also he had such a light hand I probably could have fallen asleep if it had been a longer session. Loved every bit of my experience here.< /text>< pictures>

<text>The atmosphere was great, the artists are great. I am in love with the tattoo Devx did for me and am complimented not only on the artistry but the $$ I paid for such a large detailed piece. Highly recommend this place!  they're staffed with talented people, you want good work go to Full Circle Tattoo!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Had a knee tattoo done with Mauricio. I don't know why but it hurt way less than the knee I had done in Bali 6 months before. Healed well, didn't swell up or scab very much.. Can't explain it.

10/10 would tattoo with him again.<//Review>< pics>

<text>A very cool, calm, and serine place to get work done. Good tunes, and good artists make this the only place in San Diego that I will get ink done.

I went literally yesterday and got amazing work done! The artists are great. Idk if its just san Diego but they were so impersonal. No one talked to me and I was the only person in the store. Even my artist Michelle only spoke maybe 20 sentences max with me just talking about the design. I felt bad about not tipping but I paid 220 for some black line work, and felt like I was imposing on them the entire time.</Review>

<Review>Easily one of, if not the best tattoo shop in SanDiego. I highly recommend all of the artists, especially Chong since he did all of my work. If you don't mind paying for a professional this is the place to go.< /Review><user>113303755463810878873<//user>< GmapID>

It was a bit pricey for the size and style of the two tattoos I had done here but you get what you pay for.  The work is perfect, the people are chill, and it's a clean cool looking shop with lots of great artists.<//Text>

<Text>Really friendly staff. They let me stay warm for a while after my car broke down and I was waiting for a ride. I only had a bagel with cream cheese but it was above average & the bagel was super soft. The young deli attendant was professional and courteous. Nice store in an old building and a great location for travelers.</Text>< Pics>

Perfect pesto sandwich. Yummy. Sat up on the upper deck and got up some emails and enjoyed some wonderful wild dog coffee. Met the owner and chat with some customers on their travels...<//review>

< review>
Masks are required in this quaint little shop.  Staff are friendly, coffee is delicious.  Need something sweet? They offer fresh baked large cookies.  Looking for some xmas decor or a new jam, syrup, salsa, bbq sauce, mugs or christmas ornaments. They have some artsy napkins tea towels etc. Whike drinking my coffee a fresh cut xas tree was put up. I was invited to decorate it.  I always stop here to say hello when passing through. I love the friendly small town family feel and country atmosphere.<//review>

<review>I had no idea where the heck this was, so thanks Google for telling me where I was! I did a group ride and this was one of our stops. What a neat little place! I grabbed hot coco to warm up. They had friendly staff and a lot of cool things, many looked to be local foods and such. If you are in the area it is a must for a quick stop! Check them out!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1583199596727, 'text': 'We love to see cyclists stop by during their rides in the area.

Make you feel dumb for not knowing what you're doing and ask a question. And then be told that you're responsible for the choices you make.  And then announce nobody there plays it so they don't know anything about it.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Sandwich was very good.  But was difficult to eat while holding my 11 month old.  They do not have high chairs or child seats.  Definitely not child friendly.   Also cafe in markleeville is more family friendly.< /review>

07/23/18: As the owner mentioned, Woodford's Station has changed ownership and we had a very nice experience, welcoming and friendly service. Thanks to the owners for the heads up to update my review! We look forward to visiting again!

Old review:
Extremely rude people...
On being asked for some water from the deli..."Sir, the bathroom is right there...it has the same water I have".
They also apparently hate bicyclists. "You put your bike on the porch. Do you want me to wash it for you"?
[No bike stands of course, on this extremely popular bike route].</text>

Great products & the best value a lot of the time. Communication is great and staff is friendly. Shipping to Georgia is done in a reasonable amount of time. A small mistake was made once, but was alleviated in a very reasonable amount of time.< /review>

Was hoping for a better experience. I will say that the 1 and 2 star reviews are very accurate. Just a drop shipper who doesn't know any thing about cars. I got some fenders that were pretty bad. After a lot emails, he said he would only give me 300.  A few auto body guys stepped in and said the fenders need a ton of work and that 300 was to low but I  still said fine, its going to cost me more to ship them back. I took a screen shot of his response and conditions. He is going to say he offered a return label, but that wasn't until he got drug on facebook for trying to pass off bad fenders. We had agreed that I would take the fenders down if he paid for the fender repairs and we both would move on. Well he backed out and canceled the electric check he sent me.  He claims extortion, threatens to sue people for defamation who don't agree with him and then blocks them. He will do anything to save his skin. Just watch what he responds with. It got so bad at one point, the owner of L5 motorsports (the vendor) reached out to me to try and help. She agreed to help with getting the fenders fixed, but Mike said no . I originally asked for 565.50, as a lot of autobody professionals said that should cover the repairs of the  fenders to make them right. I reached out to Sue and Mike and told that the repairs came in at 485 and that I dont need the full 565.50 I had originally asked for. Sure sounds like I was an extortionist! Mike wanted me to word a post a certain way on Facebook to make me look bad and he the victim. You can see by the responses to negative feedback that its always excuses and never his fault. He is just mad he couldn't buy me off like others. I don't need money. He asked for a review so he gets one. I'm not keeping hush money so that he can hurt others in our great car community.

Oh, hes going to make up lies about how I asked for 57 percent. My original asking price was 562.50, which is 25 percent of my 2200 order for 4 bad fenders. 57 percent of 2200 is 1,254. 1,254 is not 565.50. He also fails to mention the part that after the parts were fixed, I asked for a reimbursement of 485, not the 562.50 he agreed to and then backed out of. So not only is he liar, he cant even do math correctly.

You have to ask yourself if you are comfortable doing business with a company that offers hush money.

Wish I had a better experience.<//text>

{'time': 1621088744563, 'text': "The reality is L5 should have sent better product BUT they AND TPS has on separate multiple occasions agreed to take the parts back even offering to send a label.  If Luke would have contacted us immediately with this instead of posting on social media it would have been resolved.  If you buy a TV from Walmart would you go to Sony to resolve the issue?  Would you ask Sony for a 57% discount when Walmart sold you the TV?  If a retailer is happy to take it back, send a prepaid shipping label and offer a full refund wouldn't you send it back?  We have sent him a label already to return the product.\n\nTPS & Lewis 5 has given him the option to send back the pars with a prepaid label for over 2 weeks now and he won't return them.  At this point we don't want any future issues with his product and want them back... we don't want him to spend $100's or more in body work for the fenders and still not be satisfied.\n\nTPS has been around for 14 and has always taken care of customers with support and customer service. If there are issues we want to resolve it to the best of our ability to please the customer. We’ve never hidden, shied away, or ignored customers who needed our help when an order didn’t go as planned including this one. Luke Nelson never told us he had issues with the product until almost 2 weeks after he posted it all over social media.  Then instead of contacting us to help resolve it he goes to our supplier Lewis 5 which didn’t sell him the product.\n\nHe has always refused to send them back to us for one reason or another from day 1. He has consistently asked for more and more money. He has essentially extorted us by making crazy comments, threats and accusations which aren’t true. In the end we agreed to give him what he wanted just to make him happy... all he had to do is go public that he wouldn’t ask for more money... he wouldn’t do it. Why won’t he do it I asked him many times? He won’t provide an answer... only thing I can deduce from that is will be asking for more money so essentially he can he can get them for free. He was offered a 30% discount on the rears he bought... it wasn’t enough for him... then he wanted 47%... he changed his mind... then he wanted 57%. At what point is enough? What business gives away $1100 item? We’ve tried our best to make him happy... it’s impossible. He’ll never be happy until he gets them for free\n\nWe’ve sold 7 sets of fenders over the last 3 days... best 3 day sales ever.  The Corvette community sees the fraud that Luke is and has ignored his ridiculous comnments.  He has been chastized for his comments & posts.  Thanks to all the great people in the corvette community who has supported us and continue to do so.\n\nClick the link below for the whole story\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/595708000590638/permalink/1724059787755448/?comment_id=1725598264268267&reply_comment_id=1725632730931487&notif_id=1621044813017309&ref=notif&notif_t=group_comment_mention"}<//resp>

They specialize in muscle cars. They have 4-5 lifts. They did an excellent job on my brand new C8 corvette that was still under 500 miles. Work comprises of: Dropping the front with a lowering kit I provided, drop the coil over in the rear, added new wheels and alignment. I would recommend them and return if I wanted any other work on the car. The technicians were professional and has an eye for details and called me with pictures of the work.

<Text>My Chrysler gearbox oil pump died breaking the gearbox and making the car not drivable. I contacted the TPS Motorsports and they were able to diagnose the car by next day. They provided couple of options for repairs and recommended to rebuild the gearbox. I went with it. They estimated the repairs to take a week and it took a day less. They charged me what they had estimated. The car drives even better than before the gearbox failure. The rebuilt gearbox switches gears so smoothly.

The communication with Mike was very pleasant. His was considering and caring about the problem. He replied to email communication very promptly. He always replied back when he said he would. I mean, just perfect in all ways.

It was great experience with them and I would take my car there for any repairs.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Be aware buyers, this is a scammer, they are selling you what they’ don’t have on their website,  they were charged my bank for an exhaust system, after 7 months I still have not received it yet. I was calling Mike for many times  and he kept promise me my exhaust will be shipping out next week, but I don’t know how many the next week already passed.
When an item is in back order or out of stock you should not charge your customers until that part is back in stock and ready to ship.
I will report this company to it local authorities as a scammer very soon.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1620859753661< /Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>Brought in my 2016 SS A10 camaro to Mike at TPS motor sports. Before my appointment I had gotten into an accident , Mike took care of me and said he could fix my ss and upgrade it at the same time. What a life saver. I asked to make my car into something that can run 10 second quarter miles. Was gonna stick with some NA upgrades but ended up getting a pro charger as Mike helped me realize it was a smarter thing to do. Now what people need to understand is that Mike has a lot of cars coming to him for obvious reasons. So if they are busy expect a wait but it’s worth it. Another thing is covid shipping on auto parts. That might take a while for some people and it’s out of any ones control , but Mike kept me informed through out. Overall I am very happy with the work Mike and his shop have done to my car. It’s my daily driven race car and I am amazed by the power it has now. All my engine work will be done with TPS motor sports and I will recommend him to all my friends.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1621088781302, 'text': 'No problem Anthony!

A long wait but well worth it for a KB flowzilla setup for the notchback.   Big delay with covid but happy in the end to get exactly what I wanted.

<Text>I purchased their 1 7/8" Headers for my C6 Corvette.
The good:  Affordable headers with quick shipping.
The bad:  Exhaust fitment was poor and had interference to bell housing and oil cooler lines.  When I contacted TPS they said all headers were like that and then offered no help at all and after their initial response to my email just quit replying all together.  Definitely will not do business again.<//Text><gmapID>0x808e35036bd2238f:0xba6ffc1d29740465</gmapID><Resp>{'time': 1602879600963, 'text': 'Ryan,\n\nWe received 1 email from you stating your were having installation issues and we gave you some feedback to help you with your installation.  We never heard back from you again and to state we quit replying all together is false.  If you are still having issues we can talk to you over the phone or it may be best for you to take the headers to a qualified mechanic to finish the install.\n\nEvery header manufacture has tight clearance issues with the lines. You will just have to loosen the lines and headers to readjust them to get more clearance.

<text>Usually don’t write reviews, but feel compelled to write thus one. I’ve searched around and have been referred around with negative results. I was looking for a reputable place to install side marker lights, Corsa Extreme Exhaust to my 2017 Grand Sport.  I decided on TPS motor sports and happy I did. Although, approximately   70 miles from my house, I’m happy with the results. I’m also having them install carbon rear diffuser, an A&A supercharger charger kit, Carbon hood vent! I didn’t plan on this, but I know they will do a great job 👏<//text><Date>1603137739017<//Date><Response>{'time': 1603273122838, 'text': 'Jim,\n\nThank you VERY much for making the trek to us to have us modify and service your Corvette.

<text>Mike and Team are top notch professionals. I had some work done on my Mustang and could not be happier. I was actually going to get an Uber for the ride home and Ed asked me where I lived. I said south SJ and he said it was on his way and could drop me off. These guys above and beyond and will always know my car is in great hands when I leave.

A follow-up to my review. I know TPS is known for working on performance cars, but I also was able to take my son's Honda Civic in for fluid changes (transmission and coolant) and a brake fluid flush. You really cannot go wrong with TPS, they really are a great team! I would highly encourage you taking your car there for general maintenance or for installing that supercharger. You won't go wrong!</text>< pictures>

<Review>Not really a fault considering the circumstances but I had a bit of a wait to receive my powder coated caliper set.  The wait was worth it since the set looks great. Mike and crew are also really responsive when you have questions via email or phone call like I did.

Have not installed the calipers so will update once that happens but my initial purchase experience and product impressions are good so far.<//Review><UserId.>111755340126953341565</UserId.><rating>5</rating><date>1607196019517</date>< name>

If you don’t have the parts...you shouldn’t sell the parts. Just be honest with clients when your holding their $2000.
I cancelled my order after 30 days and numerous delays and still no ship date. I was promised the exhaust would ship “next Friday”.  It was always “next Friday”. I ordered from a different vendor and had the new exhaust in 3 days.</review>

Mike got me setup with headers and x pipe for a 60th Anniv. C6.  Couldn’t be happier with the assistance from Mike, the quality of the product, and the fitment of the product. Thanks guy!

With the headers, new x pipe, and a dyno tune, I’m now putting down 420 rwhp in a low mileage LS3 manual car weighing only 3200 pounds. Fun city!< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Do not buy from this place online. I cannot leave a review about their work quality, or in person service, but do not order from them online. What a joke. Terrible customer service. I'm not about to write an essay for a review because that's what it would take to explain all the issues I had with them and Kenne Bell. Overall very dissatisfied with dealing with them as an online vendor, and if you think you will get support after they have your money, think again. I had to pay $650 for a local tune after they could not produce the custom tune I paid for. Mike, I think he's the owner, would forget about my concerns, not respond, and littleraly didn't seem to care about my issues. My Kenne Belle and subframes both said in stock on the website, took months to get, and I was given every corona excuse he could think of.
The following is just one of the emails between us... If you use them, I wish you the best of luck. All the critical 1 and 2 star reviews are 100% accurate.

No, that does not work for me. I'll just take the refund. You said if I sent the chip back I'd get a $350 dollar refund. I didn't know you had forgotten you gave me $200 back. I told you and Mike from Kenne over Email and on forms I had to fill out for both you. I must have said I had 3.73 rear gears 12 times between the 2 of you. You even said you would make sure he knew. I have every email saved.  And in the end it was still not done right, and then that wasn't rectified. I'm sorry I didnt spend enough money with you guys to be any sort of priority for either of you. In the end, considering you gave me $200 back a few weeks ago, and another $150 now,  it still cost me an EXTRA $300 to get a custom tune done locally because all I needed was a tune for a 3.73 gear. So no, I'm not doing this with you guys anymore. Please just refund the $150.< /text>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1602037111148, 'text': "Sam,\n\nUnfortunately when you placed your order in later April Covid restrictions was already taking place which caused massive delays in order fulfillment because it because impossible to get certain parts.  When we ran the sale on the Kenne Bell Superchargers we made it very clear it was going to be at least 2 months before any kits would ship.  Little did we know that Kenne Bell and all their subcontractors would be shut down for 4 months.  And even when they reopened it took many months and weeks for them to get cranked up due to work place restrictions in CA.  In Southern CA where Kenne Bell is they have the majority of the Covid cases & deaths in CA and it took awhile for them to get ramped up again.. in fact most CA businesses are not operating ANY where near capacity right now.  The manufacturer of the subframes suffered the same issues which is why we switched you over to Steeda.\n\nWe do not control what the costs of a local custom tune costs for you.. every tuner is different.\n\nWe aplogize you weren't completely happy with your purchase but unfortunately many off the delays were caused by Covid.

Talked to Mike about getting my manual transmission swapped on my 2011 Mustang, and everyone who knows, knows the MT-82 in this thing is made out of glass. I located a transmission that came out of a 2014.

Some concerns were raised about my car after I poked around on the forums, such as the clutch may not fit the flywheel because some of the first run 2011's had 2010 flywheels. Mike researched all the parts, and found a clutch that would work for both, got all the parts in before I dropped off the car.

Ed who is the head tech, is very knowledgeable and really kept me in the loop every step of the way. We ran into an issue where a solenoid was no longer present on the newer versions of the transmissions. Because this version was only in use for 2 it was very specific. Ed called me, told me the trouble, we talked it out, and he said he'll do some research and come up a solution. 30 minutes later he came through with a workaround, and we were all set.

They installed a clutch, everything for the replacement transmission, aftermarket short throw shifter and flushed the brake system for me. Upon picking up the car, Ed went over everything with me, and went over break in procedures for the clutch and anything that would need time to adjust.

I will be bringing my cars there for all my future mods that I can't wrench myself.

The TLDR version:

My car's transmissions is trash, Mike found parts that I needed for a swap, Ed the lead tech worked on the car and did a great job. Every issue we ran into, TPS came up with a solution. You should not hesitate to bring your car to them.</Text>

I've known Mike for over a decade when our kids would play baseball together and he's about as honest as they come.  I no longer live in San Jose BUT when I did I would often have them service my vehicles.. this is one of the big things I miss about San Jose.. having an honest and fair shop to service my vehicles.

I purchased a C7 Z51 brake upgrade kit from TPS and did not want or need everything in the kit. Mike was extremely helpful in getting me the upgrade items I wanted. The powder coating on the brake calipers is outstanding, I really like the color!
I did run into a problem with the one caliper and although it did take a lot longer than I would have liked, it was taken care of.
Communication was excellent and I even talked to him on the phone! He even took the time on the weekend to help me out with the issue I had.
Overall I am pleased with the quality of his products and would do business with him again.</Text>

I purchased a kenne bell 2.9 liter mammoth supercharger kit through tps motorsports and had a very good experience. Mike and Caser always answered my messages and calls even when there was no news. I admit I was a little frustrated but Covid delayed everything. Overall, I had a very good experience and would highly recommend tps motorsports.
The price of this kit was exceptional and far less than eBay or kenne bell direct.
Keep up the good work! I’ll be back when it’s time for more upgrades!< /Review>

<review>I bought a Torqstorm Kit supercharger for my Chrysler 300. The website is pretty straight forward, Mike is great, responded my emails and even call me back. Shipping was kind of  a long wait. I'll buy it again, 100% recommended.

Mike Mak and team have done an excellent job with upgrades for (2) of my vehicles a 2011 Shelby GT500 and 2012 F150 Raptor. Both received major upgrades to include Ken Bell and Whipple Superchargers with corresponding dyno tuning. Both performed exceptionally well with major Street-able HP and TQ Increases. They have always been there to help in a pinch and have done excellent work. I recently sold the Raptor which performed incredibly and reliably with Whipple SC for 150,000 miles!  I haven’t stopped utilizing them as resource for performance parts and maintenance since 2011.</review>

They were successful in dyno-tuning this out-of-state car with a ProCharger on it so that it not only passed California smog, but is crazy-fast!

Spoke with the owner of TPS (Mike) because I'm planning to move from out of state so I was wondering what I'd need to do to make my corvette Cali compliant.  Mike spent a ton of time with me on the phone giving me not only a ton of incredible advice but talking about how much I'll love California.  I was blown away by his knowledge and his exceptional customer service.  Can't recommend him and TPS highly enough!< /Text>

<review>Ordered a UPP twin turbo kit through TPS.
Mike got me setup and satisfied with my order!

There was a big mistake made when it shipped as the shipper(UPP) had it sent it to TPS in California instead of me in Ohio.

Mike made every possible effort to resolve the issue. Unfortunately FedEx will only deal with the shipper, however TPS did make every attempt on their end to get it turned around.

I will be ordering from them again!<//review>< Gmap_id>

I ordered a set of the TPS brand stainless long tube headers (C5 Corvette model) for a restomod project Im working on. I called TPS and spoke with Mike. He answered all of my questions and was great to work with. Excellent communication throughout.

The headers shipped quickly and were received within a few days. They look great. They are definitely a high quality product. These particular headers come with and x pipe and connecting pipe all the way back to the axle. Everything is mandrel bent and the slip dit connection are nice snug. I definitely recommend their TPS brand stainless headers.</Text>

Great team at TPS is all I can say. My 04 Roush was acting up aftet they replaced the stock clutch with a Mcleod Street Pro, and it wasn't even the clutch acting up I had a misfire coming from Cylinder one. Mike got my car looked at ASAP, Jeff drove the car and figured it out, Ed replaced the plug and now the car is running PERFECT.< /Review>

I've been working with TPS and Mike for over 15 years and never had an issue with him.  Their prices and service is excellent and is a reason they have been around for so long and GROWING.  ALL of these recent negative reviews aren't real.. there is no way Mike is rude to a customer.. read the other reviews through Yelp, Facebook, Google and you'll see consistant postive reviews.  Someone is leaving them fake negative reviews.< /Text>

< Review>
Took my dads truck in because it was having issues. My dad had lost his tuner but whipple offered to provide one if they had extras. Unfortunately we had to order a new one from whipple. Once the tuner came in turns out whipple installed wrong spark plugs. TPS helped us fix the issue and even gave us documentation for proof that it was a warranty issue. My dad even ended up putting his truck on the dyno. Everything still running good. Thanks guys.<//Review>

<Text>This company has the best customer service I have ever dealt with.  I have purchased two expensive items through them.  First being a chromoly roll bar the second being a full suspension setup.  They really go the extra mile and the syncrony interest free financing for 12 months is awesome and makes purchasing the larger ticket easier than from other companies.   I sent a email just a few days ago in the evening time checking up on some items I am waiting for and they responded the next morning.   I am a repeat customer due to their customer service.  I also recommend a friend to them, he purchased a corvette blower kit.  That same friend now has a turbo camaro and he is also a repeat customer.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Went in to get my 2019 ecoboost tuned, and considering its a 10 speed it was pretty hard to tune. Mike helped get the process during covid sped up and it is still running great getting pushed here and there months later. No issues. For the bad reviews on here ive worked a lot as a parts specialist at motorcycle shops and most places were delayed up to 2 months! Kind of out of there control. Sometimes time equals quality.< /Text>

Bought a bbk from tps. Brakes were amazing with a custom powdercoat. One brake had a minor defect which I informed Mike of. Mike was quick to offer a solution he powdercoated a new caliper and had it to me within 4 days. He was in communication the entire time and very helpful. Didn’t charge me shipping on anything.<//Text>

I purchased a set of used C6 Grand Sport brake calipers off of the internet. I sent them to TPS Motorsports for custom powder coating to match Millennium Yellow. I also purchased SS brake lines, Motul brake fluid and rotors. Customer service and support were excellent. My calipers came out flawless. All parts were shipped on time and everything bolted up easily. I would definitely order from TPS Motorsports in the future.< /review>

Bought a bbk from tps. Brakes were amazing with a custom powdercoat. One brake had a minor defect which I informed Mike of. Mike was quick to offer a solution he powdercoated a new caliper and had it to me within 4 days. He was in communication the entire time and very helpful. Didn’t charge me shipping on anything.</text>

<Text>TPS Motorsports did a great a job on my 2016 Corvette Z06. I had an aerodynamic wing and X-Pipe installed. The mechanics were experienced and took their time and installed everything perfectly. Mike was easy to communicate with as well and their price for the work was excellent. If you are in the Bay area I would give them a call. I will use them in the future.</Text>< time>

I  was at a race at Laguna Seca racing Spec Corvettes with SCCA with a bunch of my friends from northern and southern California. One of my friends from SoCal broke a front suspension control arm. No one in the paddock had one and it was late in the afternoon on Saturday. We called dealers, everyone around the track and no one had one. Someone suggested we call TPS so we did straight-away.
We told them our situation, but it was late on Saturday. We couldn't get there until 6 PM as they are an hour from the track. Although they were closed, Mike Mak the owner, came back at 6 PM to meet us. His son climbed the industrial racking to get the control arm we needed out of the storage. We quickly paid and got on the road. We fixed his race car that night and Sean, the driver, made his race on Sunday.
Awesome service and support in a time of need!< /Text>

I've done business with tps a few times for c6z parts. I've gotten great help them and their headers for the price are a great deal.  I saved about 6 or 700 over american racing. No they aren't as nice to look at but they sound mean, and 700 goes a long way toward other mods.  I run these catless on my ls7 with mufflerless billy boat bullets. You can hear the car from the next town over lol. Try them out!  These billyboats they custom make with no mufflers....  Loud af. Ask tps to get a set.< /text>

Worked with Mike to get a custom built rear tailgate for our Jeep CJ5 powder coated.  He was extremely flexible and responsive to my inquiries.  There were a lot of parts that needed some cleanup (rust with fresh steel) so there was some prep work to be done and a lot of detail.  He also did another bumper for me at the same time.  The results were simply fantastic, delivered in a timely matter and it looks wonderful on the Jeep.  A pleasure doing business with Mike, a real community focused small business that takes pride in everything they do!</Text>

TPS was very helpful with getting me the parts I needed. I had to complete my build in a hurry and they had the parts shipped out to me exactly when I needed them; even kind enough to discount overnight shipping for me.<//Review>

I went to TPS to have maximum motorsports full length subframe connectors installed on my 1988 mustang. My car has T-tops so it didn't handle very well even after having an almost new suspension. I had installed new tokico shocks and struts, h&r lowering springs, and even control arm bushings. Ed had my subframe connectors installed in about a day due to some issues with the floor pans. When I took my car home, the difference was night and day! My car's handling was significantly improved and I couldn't be happier! Not only did Ed weld in the subframes but he also painted the new exposed metal. Overall, TPS was awesome! Great customer service and great craftsmanship overall.< /review>

I ordered a brake package for my Mustang, and they worked with me through a bunch of personal customizing of the order, as well as filling in missing bits of the package deal, well past the purchase date.
Fantastic customer service!  Will definitely use them for future needs!<//text>

<Text>Bought a full exhaust system with some poor results. Bought their tps long tube headers. Tremendous amount of fitment issues from front to back. Not a single piece went on without hassle. Mike is not the best communicator and had to remind him multiple times of what I wanted for my order. His prices for tuning is also on the high side for simple bolt ons. Not too happy with results. If I were you, spend the extra money and get something else.</Text>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Amazing experience working with TPS Motorsports! I had purchased a 2000 C5 (w/ only 22k miles!) a couple months back and decided I wanted to up the power a bit. Mike walked me through my options and we landed on the A&A V3 SI supercharger kit based on my goals.

The kit arrived and I got a date to bring the car into the speed lab for before/after dynos, kit install & a tune. Ed, the head mechanic, was amazing and walked me through some possible items to refresh while the steering rack was already off which I agreed to. He also kept me updated along the way which was very appreciated.

Picked up the C5 today and it’s really woken up when you lay into the throttle, however it still feels totally stock when under 3k RPMs which means I have a reliable daily driver that can push me back in the seat whenever I want.

Would definitely recommend at least chatting with Mike if you’re looking for a supercharger or other performance upgrades. Very honest group of guys and very fair pricing. I’m already starting to plan my next wave of performance upgrades.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I called and ordered some pedders coilovers from these guys their website said they were in stock. But then they tell me they won’t ship out a week later, that week goes by and never got a email confirmation so I had to call them and see what was going on and then they tell me they wouldn’t be shipping out till JUNE 14th!!!! So I decided to cancel the order and now they don’t want to refund my money. Before ordering stuff from these guys I’d try a different company. This was not a good first experience and bad customer service.< /Review>< Rating>

Purchased Corbeau seats for my Corvette from Mike. Great communication, fast shipping, my lumbar add got missed and was shipped to me separately. Had to install myself. Also had an issue with the reclining mechanism on 1 seat. Mike and Corbeau were great to deal with on the remedy. Issues come up from time to time, 5 stars due to the great seats and outstanding customer service to remedy my minor issues. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I’d reached out to tps at the end of last year 2019 about some modifications to my 2016 mustang gt 5th gen whipple supercharger he recommended some support mods which made sense but googled them and sure enough every single forum for the s550 recommended the same. The man I chatted with mike was very kind and patient with me placed my order for the parts and received a email from mike when they arrived. Car dropped off that week of Course I made a couple last minute purchases which mike facilitated greatly. Then the man I met inside the shop was Ed. He was a delight always willing to swap stories and experiences never felt rushed even though it was really busy. They took really good care of my car walked over details and even last minute when I asked to change the fluid in the rear end he didn’t hesitate and got it done right there. I have much more planned for my mustang so I definitely will be back. Thank you tps team<//review>< pics>

Ive used Mike at TPS 2 times now. He makes it real easy to buy expensive parts with his layaway option.  He seems knowledgeable with the parts he caries. Its nice to be able to call him on the phone and acually talk to a real person. Although he is very busy and I cant get a hold of him right away but hes always emailed me or called me back same day most the times. I think once it was next day. Id recommend Mike at TPS Motorsports for your car parts needs. If your reading this Mike thank you thank you. I just have to find time to install all my new parts.<//Text>

Mike / TPS,

Thank you so much for your help with my summer project.
Yellow Brake Calipers for my Grand sport, I had a vision and you made it a reality!
Quality workmanship and a fair, actually great price, including the rebuild!
I've had the car back on the road for 4 days, and already more compliments and questions than the previous year.
-
At the car wash after picking it up, a guy with a new C7 was taking pictures of my baby! hilarious!

thank you again,
Joseph Webber<//Text>

<text>Kit and everything was great, Mike worked with me on deciding what kit would be best for the setup I wanted. However after I purchased the kit, the communication was non existent. All in all, my experience would have been a 5 had there been communication on my kit after I purchased it. Seems like Mike wanted to just get your money and provide poor communication after.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Nothing but good things to say about TPS Motorsports! Was skeptical at first but did some research and saw Mike and the other guys were active on SVTPerformance so that eased my mind. I used the layaway option for a VMP Gen 2R supercharger once it was paid off only took a couple of weeks to receive the supercharger and Mike always responded to my emails. Thanks guys, would definitely be using them again.<//Text>

I've been doing business with Mike for years. Always great service and always great products at great prices. Mike will also go the extra mile and interface with manufacturers to make sure that the customers needs are met.< /Review>

Mike was very responsive to messages, questions I had,  and even called to verify which upgrades I wanted in the kit.

< Review>
TPS Motorsports (aka Mike Mak) - No Customer Service, Fabricates Stories, Gives False Statements of shipments over and over again.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this business.  I will never do business with it again.   Charged us for a product and product not received for 3 months!  Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!<//Review>

<Review>Paul was absolutely wonderful yesterday! He got called out by AAA on my behalf when my car died at work. He recognized what my issue was immediately and instead of just towing me and being done. He quickly checked a few things and then fixed the issue. One of my battery terminals had come loose at the wire. He tightened it right up and got my car running instantly. He kindly explained what was going on and what he'd done to fix it and what my options were to prevent it happening again. Absolutely the best service I have ever received from a towing company and I've had a lot of old junker cars that had to be towed.< /Review>< user_name>

<text>I would like to thank College Oak Towing , especially the driver Tim for making this experience as good as it can be when your only vehicle breaks down, stranding you miles away from your house .Although the drivers had been very busy that day, dispatch still put me up on their call board, and their price was very reasonable considering the other places I called. At my house, with another vehicle in the driveway and a boat on the street, Tim was able to use his equipment and drive my vehicle up into the driveway for me! I would also like to add that the driver wore his protective mask, and took every precaution to follow COVID 19 guidelines to ensure not only his safety, but my safety as well. Thank you Tim!<//text><resp>None< /resp>< user>

Needed a forklift transported from Dixon to Sacramento... The rate was reasonable and the driver did an excellent job on time, so the tow actually ended up being a little cheaper than i expected<//Text>

I would definitely recommend this company. Representative Kevin was very supportive, professional, outstanding, customer care indeed, and he was highly determined to find a solution. He's not only a tow truck driver, He treats his customer's as family. That's what I look for in a referral service. Dont think about only your salary, focusing on a customer's needs also helps the company's reputation build. I'm a professional myself and I know that Customer Service and Revenue istis lifeline of ALL companies. Shane was highly professional also. I think they should be highly acknowledged by their Superiors with some type of BONUS. "Do for your employees as they would dedicate to your business." One Love out.....😁< /Text>

Jimmy and sam were great my mercedes broke down Jimmy came but couldn't move my car because it was the wrong type of tow truck for a car that couldn't be put in neutral so he called another tow truck sat there and waited with me until the other tow truck driver came made sure that it was able to get on the other tow truck even worked on my car a little bit for me and gave me a ride home whole thing took a while really nice guy I would give them 10 Stars if I could.<//text>

Was set up for a tow through my insurance company due my car not starting, even after attempting to give it a jump. Clearly not the best day of my year so far. Tillman arrived on time, called while at the front gate and was so friendly from first hello. He used a portable jump box device and got my car running in under 5 minutes. No tow needed! He spent time educating me on what can cause a drain on the battery and recommended ways to prevent it. I am so impressed by the service I received from dispatch and Tillman!!

Patrick came out today to fix out flat sent by AAA. He went beyond and above the basic customer service and repair. He was friendly, knowledgeable, quick to respond and quick to repair. He not only ensure the one tire I called for was done right, but took the time to make sure the other 3 were safe. I will recommend College Oak Towing moving forward thanks to the amazing customer service Patrick provided today!< /review>

I guess i can't fault them because the sheriff's dept effed me by calling a tow company and not me. But, I can fault them for charging me $400 because I wasn't notified until after 5pm on friday evening. I had 2 choices....pay for tow and after hours fee of $400 or pay tow plus storage fees for entire weekend because they are closed until Monday  (oh and they charge for Friday as well). So, would i call them if my car broke down to get a tow?! He** No!<//review>< Pics>

While having my vehicle towed, the tow truck driver got in a screaming match with a passerby, which I thought was going to escalate into a fist fight. The ordeal was very scary and probably added an extra 20+ minutes to my experience with this horrible tow truck driver. If you’re not stranded on the side of the road, I will suggest using someone else.<//Text>

My experience with this company was an excellent one.  My new corvette broke down late at night and I called another towing place who promised me they'd be there in 30 minutes.  About 30 minutes later, they called me back to tell me that it would be another 2 hours, minimum.  I called another place and they simply didn't pick up the phone.  The 3rd place I called was College Oak Towing.  They told me they'd be there in 30-45 minutes and managed to get there in 20 minutes.  The driver, Jerry, was very capable and gentle with my expensive car.  To those of you unfamiliar with towing, it's not easy to avoid scraping a car that rides as low as mine.  He used wood blocks and careful manipulation of the wheels and my brake input, and as a result my car was successfully towed to my house without any issues, and without a single bump or scrape.  In addition to all of this, the dispatcher that I dealt with was very polite and understanding of my situation.  This was unlike the other company I'd called, who seemed impatient and didn't walk me through the process very nicely.  As a business owner myself, I pay very close attention to the customer service of companies, particular those companies whose services don't really obligate them to be nice to you.  Other towing companies should learn from the example of this one.  I would definitely call College Oak Towing first in the future, as I honestly wouldn't trust anyone else with my car, or with my time.</review>

The best tow company in Sacramento. Cheap prices & super friendly staff. The graveyard dispatcher during the week was amazing & super sweet! The tow truck drivers are extremely knowledgeable & are very professional. I won't use another company. I'd give 10 stars if I could.
Thank you College Oak Towing</Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>We had our Driver break down in Fremont, CA and I called College Oak Towing, given all their tow trucks I see on the road. I called the AM Dispatcher @ ~ 9:30am, she took all my information and I followed up with an email gave the AM Dispatcher a detailed point of contact of my driver, location of breakdown, my company, my point of contact phone and email, etc. .

~ 3 hours later my driver called College Oak Towing and asked when they would arrive, the Afternoon Dispatcher responded they had not left yet.  I got a call shortly after from the Afternoon Dispatcher and she apologized and asked me had anyone called me to let me know when the wait time would be, I stated no. The Afternoon Dispatcher at that point stated that it would 6:00pm before they could send a truck to travel all the way to Fremont. Apologized, super busy day.

If I had known the wait was so long, I would have said thanks, but no thanks, I'll try a different tow service that is not as busy, which at the end of the day I had to do.  It cost my Company 3 hours of paying for a driver to just sit there. Granted this was on a Friday and we all know the worst driving day is on a Friday in California and stuff happens.

I tip my hat off to the Afternoon Dispatcher who at least gave me a courtesy call to let me know the actual wait time, not a fan of the AM Dispatcher, no communication, organization, dunno ?<//text>< user_name>

<Review>Terry towed my boyfriend's lowered car like a pro! Seriously never had this type of towing experience. He got there quick and was very friendly on the drive home! 100% recommend, and if we ever need towing we will use this company!

Poor Customer Service, Employees are not professional. Never do service with them if you don’t want to wait more than 3 hours for a tow< /Review>

MSG-free Pho! It's a little less salty than traditional Pho, but it's something I can see myself eating regularly.</review>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>This pho place was a lot nicer and cleaner than most I've been to. The restaurant was decently sized and there was even a bar. I used a yelp deal and got Cajun garlic truffle fries with my pho tai (rare steak). There were so many different flavored fries! I love that these fries were thin and crispy. The ones I got were kind of spicy but there were other flavors you could have gotten too! I chose the Cajun garlic truffle because they were literally all the flavors I love on my fries and I've NEVER seen fries with all three seasonings!! I would come back just for the fries. You could just order the fries for $3 also.

I was hungry so I got the pho. The meat was pretty tough but I'm not sure if it was just my pho or if it's normally like that. I honestly think the fries are better than the pho... but I have a bias towards fries as you can tell. Overall, I would come here again to eat<//review>< pics>

I came by at 805 pm today and asked if I wanted a booth or to sit at the bar as I was alone.
I requested a booth which was cleared and cleaned.
I have been here before at the opening ing by the way but have stayed away due to past poor treatment towards my date in the past.

Tonite the place was about half full.

I too my seat after it was cleared and set to read while waiting.
After reading all the letters to the editor and the main editorial article I still had no menu.

I got up and left and obviously not missed at the staff was bending over backwards to thier Asian customers leaving me to be ignored, and from the comments if another guest try to get service he and his wife also.

I had came here as normally the food is good and it is close and open Wednesday which the far better Saigon District is not.
So I had bun’ at a place on brook gust and talbert.

That is another story.

Too bad this place is limiting itself.
Viet food is very popular among non Asians in OC. The restauranteurs should see this by now.< /text>

<Review>I went with my family at around 2pm today and it was really empty. We were the only ones there. The pho came out in a timely matter. It was pretty delicious and it is a few dollars cheaper than most pho places. Flavorful broth. Good service. Only complaint is that they don't give a lot of meat, but it's alright since the price kind of reflects that. They also give you free dessert afterwards, today it was a sweet tapioca pudding. Would like to come back again.< /Review>< response>

<Text>I have never had a better bowl of Pho.
I chose the rare filet mignon.
Delicious !
The staff is very nice and I felt right at home.
I tried the "Rocket Shrimp" appetizer and was very happy with them. Crunchy, light, and flavorful.
I can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu.
Couldn't be happier with the food and service.😎</Text>< pictures>

<review>New pho bistro that serves boba drinks.  Food looks good but I only tried the popcorn chicken.  The chicken was tender and moist and the dipping sauce was tasty.  Couldn't really taste the garlic parmesan flavoring though.  Would go again angry their other dishes .< /review></record></dataset><record>

I love shopping here, they have a big
selection on produce and usually find everything I need. I also love the section for cooking utensils and household cookware. Aisle are small, but I the layout of the store is pretty organized. Thanks!</review>

If I could leave 0 stars I would. Rudest people ever. You ask a question in fish section and they ignore then want to argue with you. Worst customer service ever. First time there and it will be the last. Never going there again.<//Review>

Fresh fish, all sorts of vegetables and fast check out service. If your a minority they do not follow you around the store. Every customer is treated respectfully.< /text>

<Text>This is my got place anytime I want to have the fleshed fish!!!!  The staff is very knowledgeable, will always help you find something and very friendly.  They even offer the other parts of the fish like the belle, or head that arent usually displayed.  Prices are reasonable considering the freshness.  Parking is sometimes difficult but worth the patience.  Their selection of Japanese snacks are descent specially to kill any cravings.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

They care about their kind only. I purchase meat from this store all the time, because the prices are good for what I need. I spend anywhere from 4 to 600 a monthly there, and the meat Department "ALWAYS" give me a problem when I ask for cases, they speak their language, look at me, roll their eyes and start laughing as if I said something wrong..... like really.

So they security guard came out to me as I was leaving and ask me what's wrong? Your not getting anything today, I said "No" he seen O was uneasy, so I explained why. He ask me to come back and speak to the owner, I said for what? The only thing he will say is I'm sorry the language we speak is not good, So "NO thank you" I will spend my 600 else where. It's a shame when you spend your money in the community you live in and your family has been patronizing with this store for 6 years and you get treated the way their workers treat you. So no thank you Mr. Security i will not waste another dime here at Welco.</text>

<review>Other then paying your bills... the employees are very rude and nasty one cashier blew snot on the floor instead of using the tissue , I'm afraid to buy food there they seem unsanitary... the cashiers were very unfriendly and seem that they did not want to be bothered with the customers.
.One security guard was being really racist and discriminating, instead of asking the customers if they needed help he tries to insinuate that they are still eating but yet have no proof of it just because a customer looks around and ask questions they're automatically thieves. I don't know how this store would like to expand their clientele if they are going to continue to have people working for then that are not customer friendly. Hope they will improve they have a long ways to go.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bad, I use to shop there all the time in early 2000's was my favorite store to go 2,

my kids loved the hot dogs or I was always told they're called pig's in blanket, any  how I like meat counter
Always friendly even spoked a lil Spanish was perfect 😺👍since 2009, we moved to more towards Elk Grove,my family still lives over there by The high school HJ,so I decided to stop by to get some meat and few other things, when I went to the counter no one was there and there was two men just standing there taking 4 about a good 5min behind the meat counter so while waiting a Asian women comes out of nowhere and right away they tended 2her so just looked at guy and said "REALLY" and walked away and complained to the cashier , she agreed that they have been getting complaints about the buchers,, and one lady that works with them always has attitude with the non Asian customers so I don't give them no star, I miss the old staff< /review>< Response>

I was very happy with the service and information I received this past week at the Trinity Parkway Mattress Firm store.   I ultimately purchased a mattress after a second visit to the store.  There was no high pressure sales pitch which I appreciated.  I was asked what I was looking for and was shown several mattresses in different price ranges which I appreciated as well.  I would recommend this location if you are in the market for a new mattress.</review>

One of the easiest purchases I have ever made. The sales lady was so helpful, knowledgeable and kind. She listened to what I wanted and pointed me in the direction of the perfect mattress! Delivery is going to be fast and they will set up and take away my old mattress. Very happy with the process.</Text>

I had a great experience shopping here. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. I wanted to buy a queen mattress and Alisha was the perfect help. She walked me through all the available options and helped me decide what to buy. Definitely coming here again when I have to buy another mattress< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We came in today to find the perfect Tempurpedic mattress. We were greeted quickly  by Gentleman named Mes. Turns out he was the store manager and we couldn’t  have been happier with his service. This guy was so informative and patient. Real professional and respectful to both my wife and I. Most people who work at a store like this would have left us high and dry when he found out that were there for warranty replacement and not actually buying a new bed. Instead, he told us how much more important it was for us to find the right match. So he stayed with us and talked through out our visit and helped compare prices and gave us all the important info we needed. When we left he walked us out and sent us off with smiles and the perfect mattress. Thank you Mes, we appreciate you.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Mes was the best sales rep that has ever assisted me in shopping or making a purchasing decision.  He tended to us right away but wasn't pushy.  Explained everything very clearly and gave us pros and cons to help us make our final decision. He was very polite and pleasant and made our experience enjoyable
and I  would highly recommend going here if your looking for mattress.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809009984813a109:0xcf89a7c9da05bba4<//gmapID></record>

Mes is amazing! Went in just to look but could not pass up the wonderful deal and feel of the purple mattress! He's super knowledgeable and friendly! My husband and I definitely recommend Mattress Firm in Stockton! Ask for Mes!</review>

My wife & I came in to look for a new Mattress/BoxSpring set.  The Manager greeted us with a smile. (through a mask at a socially acceptable distance) He was very friendly & we could tell that he truly wanted to help us find a product that would serve us well.  We tried some options & had a pleasant experience deciding on what features we felt were nice, necessary & must haves.  When it was narrowed down to a couple options he gave us space to talk things over & once we decided; he quickly helped finalize the details of purchase & delivery.</Text>

I've gone here twice for two separate mattresses. Both times, the staff, two separate staff members, were extremely polite, not pushy, and knowledgeable about their products. They encouraged trying out mattresses and we're personable. I had a great time when I went in both times.<//Text>

I'm just leaving a good review because I called the store for assistance and was helped even though they knew I wasn't going to buy anything.  the staff here are extremely pleasant, helpful, and I will go to mattress firm next time I do make a bed related purchase.  I respect the humanity and old fashioned good manners being practiced by the staff.< /review>

<Text>Simply awesome! Great service and communication from the entire staff. Worked with Taylore the Store Manger. Friendly, knowledgeable, and professional (and very patient dealing with my odd purchase request). Will definitely be returning for repeat business. I would highly recommend visiting Mattress Firm in North Stockton before you make a decision as important as buying your next bed.</Text>< Gmap_id>

The manager  totally educated me. I found I want a hybrid mattress. I spent two hours laying on all the different types. I prefer a medium firm mattress. I also  got a adjustable frame. I can't wait to get my mattress. I highly recommend this  store<//text>< Rating>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Went in the store and was assisted by the store manager Mesfin who goes by Mess. He seem cool and everything sounded good so we purchased a Tempur-pedic. When it arrived, we only got one side of the king size flat foundation. Was told by the delivery guys that that’s all they had at there warehouse and the other side would get deliver in a day or two. I decided to call the store two days later to make sure my order was coming. Spoke to Mess again. He explained that it was his fault for only ordering 1 side of the flat foundation and I would have to go in the store and buy the other side. Coming on! You’re a store manager and you knew what you did wrong. Try to say you gave me the bed cover and foundation for free. Then now I can’t even enjoy my bed until I buy the other side of the foundation. Couldn’t even offer me anything for messing up my order. A place that is suppose to be great and that customers can trust. I don’t think I can go back and trust Mattress Firm anymore. What a bad first experience. For the price I paid, I didn’t expect to have to go through this.<//Review></record>

You wont have a better experience than this store.
Time is money and sleep is precious. Don't skimp on a matress. Dont play when it comes to your sleep. Anyone here will be happy to help you. If you have the good fortune of being helped by a gentleman name Mesfin, enjoy... he is hes gonna take real good care of you.< /Review>

Update on recent visit on 9/4/20...
Taylor...was no longer the BEST professional salesperson after all. I came in today to get some clarity with the finance company about an exchange and upgrade to a higher priced mattress, and was met with a calloused and condescending attitude.  Taylor...your disposition isn’t new just serpentine!

Taylor, you are the BEST, in my opinion, at what you do! You are a knowledgeable, informative, patient-people-person professional I‘ve had the most pleasure dealing with my mattress exchange/purchase!!! You made the whole process go smoothly and you were very detailed and explained everything step-by-step that, in the end, made me at peace and satisfied with the brand that I chose. I can’t thank you enough! I am looking forward now to finally getting some restful and desperately needed deep sleep with my new mattress! I wish I could clone you because customer service industries NEED more people like YOU!!! Thank you again!

From customer,
I. Wilson<//Text>

Tried going to Ashley's for a bed. Prices where to high. Went across the parking lot to Mattress Firm and Alexandria there took exceptional care of me and my wife. We got the same bed at Mattress Firm that we where looking at Ashley's for half the price. If you ever need a bed go see Alexabdria at Matress Firm, she is the best. Higest marks for her.< /text>

I want to thank Shannon for her excellent customer service on helping me with choosing not only a bed but a base that would supply comfort to my expecting wife and I. She took us through many options of beds and bases that would help us with our breathing, circulation and over all sleep. This has made me very happy as i was just diagnosed with a heart condition that requires me to sleep on a more upright  position and after i left the mattress firm i was confident that i came to the right place so thank you for all your help. Large shout out to Shannon's outstanding customer service i will definitely refer family and friends to her.</review>

Taylor was so helpful, informative, extremely friendly and personable. She knew exactly what I needed with a few quick questions. She quickly and efficiently had me set up with what I needed and next day delivery in exactly 5 minutes.  I got an immediate invoice via email from Taylor, paid it and got delivery confirmation within a few minutes.
I will definitely be using Matress Firm Stockton North for all of my future matress needs.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809009984813a109:0xcf89a7c9da05bba4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Shannon was awesome. She was very informative with the products and she was so helpful in helping us choose the perfect mattress. Would highly recommend her and this location. No one was pushy or trying to "oversell" unneeded items. Thank you Shannon!</review>

<Review>Shannon was an AMAZING help. My husband and I are in the process of moving with a baby on the way and we need entirely all new furniture. We stopped by the Mattress Firm in Stockton just to look at price points, and walked out with a brand new King size mattress and essentials! I am beyond happy that we stumbled into the store. Shannon is truly amazing at what she does!!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Shannon Ali was so patient in helping me select a boxspring mattress and pillows for my home. She took the time to explain the pros and cons of individual pillows and how certain pillows would help me sleep better.  If you ever need a mattress or pillows, make sure that you visit Shannon!!< /Text>

George was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable. He answered each of our questions and concerns and helped us pick just the right mattress for our needs and budget. He arranged a timely delivery (we live quite a distance out so our expectations were low for this)
We couldn’t ask for a more pleasant and easy purchase, I wish all our future purchases could be this easy.</Review>

I had the best experience at this place choosing my mattress thanks to this employee name Joanna! She was very helpful and super attentive. I explained her the type of mattress I wanted and she knew exactly which mattress I should get. I ended up getting the bed “Simmons beauty rest black ice” and I was beyond happy that I made this purchase and had someone like Joanna that knows all about mattresses and help me pick the right one. Anyone that is going to this store ask for her. I’ll will be coming back.<//review>

Joanna assisted me in purchasing a mattress. She was very attentive, knowledgeable, professional  and pleasant to work with. She took the time to address all of my questions and concerns regarding finding the perfect mattress for me. I’m so pleased with my level of service received by Joanna. I will be sure to refer all of my friends, family and colleagues to her. Thank you, Joanna.< /text>

Joanna was absolutely amazing to work with! She was very welcoming and pleasant. She educated me on the beds I was looking at and helped me choose the right one to fit my comfort needs. I am very happy with my choice and the service I've received. I would recommend Joanna to anyone looking to buy a new bed.< /review>

<text>Five stars for Angelina and the other sales people but only ONE star for the delivery side. The main guy was rude condescending and angry. He actually told me I was going to hate my bed. It's been over two weeks and I still haven't received my headboard. Because of the delivery service I probably won't go back again. There was no consideration for customer convenience and I bought one of the most expensive beds on the floor!<//text><username>lisa rodrigues< /username></record></dataset><record>

I enjoyed myself at the Monteith park today because I got a chance to read some more of my bible (because I'm starting to read the bible again) in my car in the shade while I was charging my phone in which I didn't need to do but it's okay. 😊</text>

<text>This park means a lot to me. It was where my daughter Khalillah and I spent many hours just being together before she passed. I feel close to her when I walk or just sit. This is our neighborhood and we spent many hours walking and talking in this area,  Where  were are so proud to live.< /text>< Pics>

Very cool hidden Gem in the Angeles Hills. Small and cozy; perfect for resting amid a bike ride or neighborhood walk. VERY shaded!<//review>

I see lots of people walking their dogs through here but not too many people hanging out which is understandable because you always feel like someone is watching you from afar lol.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Great Neighborhood Park always has been never any problems and a perfect neighborhood park.. We used to play football in the park over 40 years ago and it still a wonderful spot.  Same Park now as it was then.  Neighbors and law enforcement don't allow nonsense and foolishness in the park.<//text>< Pictures>

Honest and reliable! I came in to replace a car light that was out and upon completion, one of the team members informed me it did not need to be replaced after it. It was just loose. The fact that they were so honest and didn’t just have me purchase a bulb really built trust in me now returning for all services which have all been great. Highly recommend this center.</text>

This country has lost its core essence of manners, service and quality and it shows at Walmart.<//review></record>

I arrived early for an oil change. It was performed in 35 minutes, I left very pleased with the service that I was given. I guess it's all based on the time that I showed up. Without rushing, and without worrying about other items in my agenda. Thank you Walmart Auto Care El Centro, CA.</text>

I had just put air into the tire and it wasn't what was put on the paperwork. Also the windshield washer fluid was shown as checked but was actually empty. It makes me wonder what else was not checked. Will not be going back.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The worst service possible. I went to exchange a battery since it was dead and they made me wait almost 2 hours to tell me that i needed a replacement. And i needed to be somewhere as fast as possible. Urghhhh. I would not buy batteries again at walmart.<//Review>

I waited 2 hours for an oil change with only two other cars in front of me. After I waited the time I went back to find out that they never changed the oil because “The oil drain plug was too tight”, then they proceeded to tell me that I needed to go somewhere else. I was so insulted by the way they told me, I will no longer be coming here for any service. Not only that but I also asked for a wiper change and to no surprise they didn’t do that either, so they had my car and did absolutely nothing to it except for park it in the parking lot. Terrible service, don’t come here for any automotive service. If I could put zero stars I would.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It was a day with a lot of air, and I spoke on the phone to say that I was outside to be attended, they had me waiting for more than 30 minutes.

They never answer and I decide to get out of the car to see what happened and Mrs. Jody tells me that she can no longer receive my car for service after more than 30 minutes of waiting and another 30 minutes that I had to wait inside the walmart car service

REALLY VERY BAD SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS, NORMALLY I COME HERE BUT I WILL LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE WHERE IF THEY VALUE THE CUSTOMERS.

<Review>The staff was nice but the facilities are not secure. My first unit latch was non functioning but it looked normal. Anyone could walk up and lift the door. I noticed after I had things stored for a week or so. The second unit they gave me was better but there was a gap in the cheap wall so anyone could stand in the hallway and peer in, and the material they built with is so flimsy you could rip it down and break in without much effort if you really wanted the contents. I never felt safe leaving my stuff there and the one camera I could see was just an empty case. I moved to a much better facility that’s got metal construction, a roll up gate, and climate control for $10 more a month for a larger unit.< /Review>< pictures>

I came in last week and really needed help. The lady at the front desk was super helpful. Think her name was Monika. She was very accommodating and walked me around the location and it was a lot cleaner than another CubeSmart I looked at. I had to give a review because you don’t find people too often that go the extra mile and care.<//Review>

This morning I signed up for a new unit and it was a busy from the moment I walked into the office. Monica and Reuben juggled every situation with ease and took great care of me. Their smiling faces made my difficult situation less stressful and they helped me with everything I needed to get my storage unit. The office and the property was clean and Monica was very accommodating, she gave me a bottle of water while I waited to get all the paperwork finished. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a  local storage place with GREAT customer service and smiling faces.< /Text>

Lee Gonzales is one of the managers there along with Monica. They are both very personable and communicate well. I have a special affinity for Lee, he always reminds me of my due date and whether I am late and/or how close I am to incruing another fee. I honestly come bye the Jamacha location just to speak with Lee and get words of wisdom and just to see how the man is doing. Great clean facility to store your belongings. A+ grade from me!< /Text>

The old lady in the office I forgot her name, but she gave me an attitude because I went the wrong way to open the gate.all she had to do was Kindly tell me I'm going the wrong way. I can kind of tell she was having a bad day but you shouldn't take it out on your customers that's bad for business!<//Text>

I worked with Lee although Monica was also helpful as she juggled her morning conference call. Lee took me to my storage and it was jammed so instead of saying hey I'll get that fixed for you . He said we have to fix this let's get you another unit. I completely appreciate it. I had a tough time with my gate code and Lee worked with the system till it worked .

If you are looking for a storage place, LOOK no further. I can only speak for myself. I had an emergency move and CubeSmart was my saving grace place! The timing was great, 1st month free! I have a very large unit and yes its expensive, but it is worth it. It holds my entire 3 bedroom HOUSE. The gate hours and office hours are great. As a woman I feel safe to drive right up to my unit, I go in and out of my unit daily. I must recognize Monica Fraga & Jae Mordelle for their outstanding Customer Service. If you call or go in and talk to these ladies, they will do their best to help you. I have a testimony that validates this! I know that everyone will not be satisfied and I get it, however I do recommend anyone that has a issue or complaint please see one of these ladies. But remember you must talk to them. These ladies do their job. In closing, I wish that I could give this CubeSmart at 9180 Jamacha Rd, Spring Valley 91977 a "8-STAR rating". No one is perfect and life has its moments, Monica and Jae will understand as long as its real and makes sense. CubeSmart ranks #1....< /text>

When the contract was done, and fees paid, there was some confusion about the costs as stated in my reservation. I was supposed to get the first month free. I sent Monica an email and got a call back from Lou who confirmed the error on their part and was asked to go back down to the office so that it can be fixed. They did it with no problem and have been superb to deal with!!! Great customer service!!! On top of that, I was able to move in earlier than requested!!!</review>

I wasn't sure what size unit I needed and I was shown different size units which helped me decide which size was best for me.
Monica Fraga, General Manager, was a great help.  She was quick with the paperwork and a pleasure to do business with.
I would recommend  this CubeSmart Self Storage to other and give it five stars.

Nice clean facility at a reasonable rate. Monica, the manager, was very nice and extremely helpful. The unit I got was the exact size I needed and more conveniently located than I expected it would be, and the 6am to 10pm accessibilty is great!</review>

They definitely hit you with extra costs, there is no "first month free". Make sure you can show you are covered by insurance, you have to prove it or they charge you. Good location and hours are good.<//Text>

I recently had my MASTER LOCK picked and storage unit broken into. If you must use this place, please double lock your unit and buy durable locks.

If your storage unit is broken into, the INSURANCE will not reimburse you unless you show that your lock was broken or tampered with. So if you get your lock picked, cut it, break it, or do anything you can to show that it was tampered with or you're not getting any money.

Also, the cameras their do not work during the night. The cameras are on, but do not pick up much and if your car's headlights are on they are going to distort the cameras.
Apparently the manager there is aware of these break-ins but is not disclosing them or doing anything about it.

PLEASE BE AWARE!!!
USE ANOTHER STORAGE LOCATION EVEN IF IT COSTS A LITTLE MORE. STAY AWAY FROM THE TROUBLE AND THE PAIN.</Review>< pictures>

I found CubeSmart using an internet search, it was the right price for my needs and was sent a reservation email from CubeSmart to confirm. The email did not include  information that proof of Homeowner's Insurance would be required to avoid $12/mo charge. At the facility the manager said the charge could be removed when I provided that, but when I returned the next day, that was not the case. The next month would not be charged for insurance. Otherwise, the facility was clean and appeared very secure. The manager was friendly and tried to be helpful.< /text>

This location of Whole Foods Market in Campbell is a fantastic location with one exception, they only sell beer and wine. :-(.

The store is on the medium to large size and has a “nutrition section” that I have not yet explored. There is plenty of parking and it is easy to get in and out of the parking lot.<//Review>

Out of the 5 employees I interacted with while shopping in the store, one was helpful, three were extremely rude, and one was completely indifferent. Such a different vibe from my usual Whole Foods store. This location used to have excellent customer service throughout the early 2000s.< /review>

<Text>Best place for vegetables. Great selection and very fresh. Meat quality is also excellent. Not as overpriced as it used to be now that Amazon is in the game. In many ways, almost comparable to Safeway price wise but with much better quality in my opinion.<//Text>< pictures>

Always the best produce. I've enjoyed shopping here for 5 years or so. I'll drive across town rather than shop at others</Review>

Prices are much better now than they used to be,  especially with a Prime membership,  but it still seems like I walk out with a pretty hefty bill every time I go there. There are a lot of things I have to get at Safeway, I guess those things don't pass the whole foods test or something.< /Text>< Pictures>

Although this place is the smallest Whole Foods I’ve ever seen, it’s usually very well stocked and the staff are very helpful. They are very careful about cleaning, too, which is important especially now.</review>

They have got the biggest stay of everything eatable an non eatable items in this area anyway.i just went in to check it out an like a dummy was so amazed I did not take one pic.Please forgive me  I have always liked taking surprise plcs.i had to wait till I was or am  72 an lm starting. Make a longstory short. Go in an just wander up an down the iles. First time visitors, make a shopping list an get the prices on what you would like to buy.Go home an total it up.OK!  It just might be a little pricy , always remember, you get what you pay for, and it's good. Now go to whole Foods, when you're hungry.Keep eating. Byebye LDS< /review>

< Review>
I go there for breakfast more than any other meal. The breakfast is hot and fresh when you get there early in the morning at 8 or so and very tasty. I had biscuits and gravy sausage bacon scrambled eggs and Yukon potatoes. My total was $9.58 just under a pound of food. That's all I need to get me through the morning. I forgot to take pictures today I was just there to eat!</Review>

<review>I will say the dessert section was beautiful to the eye. Some of the prettiest desserts I've seen in a Whole Foods.   I wanted to buy everything, whatever the cost!!

I'll definitely be coming back here again soon for lunch.</review>< Time>

I always come for the clam chowder, which is amazing. This time I went for the seafood cioppino, and it was just as good if not better. If you're in the mood for some good soups, whole foods is the spot ! The small size is also 2 for $7!</review>

Its huuge! I've never seen or been to a whole foods as large as this one. And its whole body section was like its own little store, it. was. soooooo cool, all on its own. Until I went in.

Its too bad, that even though the whole body section was like its own little store, its inventory lacked in a MAJOR way. Really disappointing for the size of this store.  :(

It was late Saturday afternoon, when we went, so of course, there was a line to get in, they were only allowing 5 people in at a time.

I have never had a bad experience at ANY whole foods location, but I didn't even have to go into the store and already, a few of the employees had already been unfriendly & a but rude, in a very aloof manner. Which is highly unlike ANY Whole Foods, I have ever been too, incl. other states

I doubt I'll return to this store location. Unless I'm in the area again. Its far. So its highly unlikely, and the rudeness doesn't send the message "Come Visit Us" instead, it was one of "We hate our jobs and we don't care how we treat customers". The quality of products was just a disappointment. Even the varieties of certain products seemed few and far between. It was NOT worth waiting in line and the store didn't seem as bright, cheery or very clean as so many other whole foods locations I have frequented. And the employees werent as friendly or so willing to help, like so many other Whole Foods Stores<//Text>

Overpriced.... The fresh food is bland which makes it a horrifying how much they charge for it. Yes they have a lot of speciality brands but to be honest you can get the same or if not better quality it your local supermarket</Review>

Everyone was wearing masks. Shelves were fairly full and very few produce areas were empty.  Only complaint was lines were very long with at least 25 people behind us waiting to checkout.<//Review>

< review>
If there's an office party, I shop for the pastries. The blackberry & raspberry are popular at the office parties I attended. Moreover, also, the freshly prepared pizza is really worthwhile!

Also, there's something about the shoppers  who frequent there as well as the attentive staff: For instance, I left my backpack (with wallet, phone, etc.) in the shopping cart in the parking lot, and drove away.

Hours later, I returned to the store to inquire, and  reclaimed my backpack, which had been turned in to the staff by some kind/thoughtful someone. It's one of my favorite stores.

Sadly, I can no longer special order pet food, for instance and there's no "rational" explanation why for the customer.</review>

I really like Whole Foods, it feels like a small family store as opposed to a large chain (even though its Amazon). They tend to have everything you’re looking for and the quality a pretty damn good.
Checkout always seems to be chaos which is the bit I don’t like, I feel that everyone is always searching for their Amazon QR code at checkout and this holding up the line - why in earth Amazon doesn’t make an iOS wallet card I don’t know.

As always, if you found this review useful please remember to like it. If people like the review (whether you agree or not), it encourages me to write more ;)</review>

The large size of the store is great, but the staff are less friendly and often hard to find than other stores.  I often get cheeses and deli items.  The cheese staff are usually available, but the deli counter can be a REAL long stores.I love the olive bar, but its a bit pricey!  Fresh veggies at this store are good, though not always great.  Nice flower options.  Overall, not bad, but good management could make this into a powerhouse of a store.< /Text>

I have the Amazon app but doesn't work in the store for discounts.  When I order food and have it delivered I get the discount. The cashier  today said You don't get a discount.  Thanks for embarrassing me in front of other customers.</Text>

Superb shopping experience! The staff is helpful and friendly. Their buffets are really what make this review a 5 star. It’s usually crowded so knowing what you need before you go is important. Their produce section could use more variety.< /review>

Food quality is excellent but the prices is insanely high.  I guess the term "Whole Paycheck" is true...  But the major thing that concerns me is that since Amazon took over slowly I've noticed some less selection and more less-than-polite employees.   They are probably being worked way too much but it's sad seeing Whole Foods slowly going downhill.  I think in the end we will find that Amazon buying them was not great for the store's brand.<//Review>

<Text>Tough to rate with new owner. 2 years ago I'd have said something more positive. Employee turnover seems to have increased and sometimes it take three or four employees to answer whether or not they have the item I need or want. they are large stores stocked with lots of items they claim don't have excessive extra chemicals added but I found I still need to read the ingredients label. Hope the new owners get their store policies reconfigured soon for the employees and their customers.</Text>< Pictures>

Amazon has to try harder. Fruit and veggies do not compare to Whole Foods.
At least not when I was there last week.

Great improvements overall.  Still need to improve grade of sushi.  Salmon is not good.  Liked the old sushi set up better.
Overall ... I love shopping there.
Especially everyone that works there.</Review>

Never a long line at checkout. Great place to grab a bite to eat from the hot foods buffet or the salad bar. Deli sandwiches made to order, hot burritos that you build, fresh pizza & lots of grab & go ready-made food to eat. The best selection of organic produce & fruit outside the local farm markets. Friendly customer service too!<//Text>

Constantly excellent quality and service. The seafood department here especially shines. Always clean, always fresh, and the staff there is phenomenal.

This location is pretty big for a Whole Foods. Great selection of vegetarian and vegan stuff. The bakery and coffee counter are awesome too. Some stuff is absurdly expensive, but the vast majority is about the same price as Safeway. If you're vegan or vegetarian, this place is your church.</Text>

This is the Whole Foods closest to me, and just so happens to be one of my favorites.  This place isn’t as up to date as other locations.  Meaning there’s no bar, no mini-restaurant, and it’s not super huge.  But the Campbell store does have a more hipster vibe to it, which makes it fun.  I usually go for the prepared foods section, and this place always seems to have some of my favorites on hand.</review>

I hadn't been to this Whole Foods in quite a while and found I was quite disappointed. The staff were very friendly but didn't have any idea where to find anything. I really like the WHOLE Foods on the Alameda in San Jose much better.</Review>

< Review>
Whole Foods Market in Campbell is the first place I shopped with ‘healthy’ foods. The quality of meats and produce are extremely good, but the cost is also extremely high. The message the store gives with their prices is ‘only the rich deserve to shop here’.</Review>

The Campbell Location is smaller than most I've been to but you should be able to find what you need there. It can get pretty busy there (or at least feel like it because of its small size). Staff is friendly, location is clean, and items are easy to find.</review>

<Review>Disappointed that they don't use healthier ingredients to prepare their food.  For example it took them forever to offer cauliflower mash, while the SF locations offered it long before this location did.  And when they did finally offer it, it was filled with unhealthy ingredients so I didn't want it anyhow.  For someone who is vegan, you don't take a nice healthy dish like cauliflower mash and then put dairy milk in it.  What are you thinking?  If you want to add an ingredient to make it creamy, then use coconut milk!!!   And then around the holidays, my favorite is Pumpkin Pie, yet the Whole Foods pie is filled with many unhealthy ingredients so I don't purchase it.  I look to them to set the example of providing healthy quality food, as their name leads you to believe, but it's all just a facade.   And their cookies are all loaded with way too much sugar.  For one, you need to put so much sugar in everything.  And secondly, why are you even using sugar, it is so bad for you, why not sweeten using something like maple syrup or coconut sugar!</Review>< rating>

Spoiled as I remember how Whole Foods use to be. Now even the food bar closes early, was 9;30, then 9:15, now back to 8:30, and now stocked with broad selection of fattier heavy carb foods. Prepared foods as alternative, shelves empty at 8;30 pm.This was a great store that catered to locals with good healthy selections and stocked shelves. Now since "new" corporate took over they are constantly running out of items, with vacant shelves and the selection of items has diminished. Prices have gone up, I can get some of the same foods cheaper in Maui. Milk that use to be in landfill friendly containers has now reverted to non-environment friendly plastic and the freshness date is now "Drastically" reduced compared to other Organics. The staff remain excellent and apologetic.</text>

All needs in one store, but the prices are little costlier than the other grocery stores like sprouts. We’ve been a regular customer in sprouts and for a chance visited Whole Foods market located near my house. Really amazed by availability of products as the store belongs to amazon, but the prices are costly who are not having prime membership. For example mushrooms are $5.99 per pound whereas same can be bought cheaper in sprouts. So think smart before buying👍🏻< /Text>

Like any Whole Foods this is on the high end of grocery stores in terms of prices. They have more exotic and organic ingredients. The quality is generally good and there is a massive selection of almost everything. The store itself has a rather chaotic layout. Its difficult to find what you need unless you've been there before and its usually quite crowded. That said if you just need something very specific and you don't paying a little more its a good place to grocery shop. Surprisingly they have a fairly decent craft beer selection as well.</review>

This whole foods has one of the best salad bars I have been to.  Great selection of fresh and organic items.  The fresh soups are also good (my favorite is the "black bean").  They also have a good deli that makes large sandwiches and also a burritto bar, which are also huge.  The prices are a little more expensive than the usual grocery and markets, but the food here is high quality and tastes good!<//review>

This is now our go to grocery store. I would appreciate more vegetable variety, stuff you might find at a farmers market, but they have all the basics. The butchers, seafood butchers, stockers, cashiers are all very helpful.</review>

This Whole Foods is small, and crammed. The selection in the hot food area is limited. We got a burrito and felt the ingredients area did not look appealing. The staff though was nice.</Review>

Staff is very condescending be warned!. The Cafe service should be closed down because they cant ever get the drinks right. I love the Chai latte and they just always give me the regular latte! Almost always, I have to go to another whole foods to get consistency in my drink :(  Even though this one is literally behind my apartment!</Text>

I like the juice bar here. They make everything with organic veggies.  I is a little pricy but it is worth it.

They always get the juice out fast whether there are a lot of people waiting or not.

If you haven't tried it yet I would highly recommend it.< /review>

Great service and food selection. Also, if you are curious about a drink, but you don't know if you want to buy it for that price, they would comp it for you. I think one "curious" drink a week.< /review>

I would like to thank all those hard-working women out there that are going to the gym and wearing that spandex for everyone to go every witness your beautiful Splendor that is your bottom.  No I never really had this problem before it mainly because I used to shop at Walmart a lot and I never really bothered looking at anyone's bottom because that's all you could see there. But as soon as I came to Whole Foods I realized that less is more.   😂 For example get a bag of chips or some pizza at one of the chains or something else like that that's like mass-produced her basically has a ton of other Cretin eat it and you'll realize you can either eat the whole pizza or the whole bag doesn't matter you'll still feel hungry shortly after. Try that with just a slice of pizza from Whole Foods and you will feel unbelievably full after just one slice!  There is no magic going on not pulling the wall behind your eyes what it really is is good quality food that not only makes you a happier person but honestly I feel ten times better eating here. They say you can't have a pizza day I beg to differ if it's Whole Foods Pizza that stuff might add ten years to your life.  Or you can die in a horrible car crash because you could not stop looking at that woman's UPS Hoops I'm dead... It was a good way to go cheers everyone!< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< date>

<review>GREAT customer service is always excellent here. Cahiers efficient, friendly and helpful, AND, people think because it is specialty store, it is higher priced, I felt prices were very reasonable, but still had healthier, better choices.</review>< rating>

Food side needs a re- haul. Hot food is not very healthy. I think whole foods on Soquel takes the cake when it comes to the hot food section. Maybe Campbell can take notes. Campbell staff is friendly but phone service is awful.</Text>

<review>Very dissatisfied.  Loved wf. In the past.  Went yesterday and bought prebagged brussel sprouts.  Most of them had to have bad spots cut out out
It was obvious that they had not  been handpicked because most of them also had some kind of mechanical damage.  Doesn't effect taste, but not appetising to look at on your plate.  I will not buy prebagged produce here anymore.  I like my food to look appetising.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Pretty compact space with limited parking, but still manages to fit in everything you expect from a Whole Foods. Just be prepared for tight spaces during peak times.</review>

The worst Whole Foods location in San jose area. The prices are Whole Foods prices (i.e., too high) but the quality is a disaster. I have bought their made-to-go meals many times and on several occasions i have gotten sick. I should have stopped going there earlier. Be warned, if you get their sushi, youll be playing russian roulette with your own underwear for the rest of your day.

Good luck

Aside from my wallet suffering a crash diet/anorexia from shopping here, nothing else is all that unique. On the 1-10 scale the parking lot is a category 9 on the parking lot dodge em scale. 😮< /Text>

<Text>Just okay for a Whole Foods. Quality can be inconsistent. They share a parking lot with some other stores so a lot of cars pass in front of the entrance while people are trying to get in and out. Doesn't seem very safe sometimes.<//Text>< pictures>

Just okay for a Whole Foods. Quality can be inconsistent. They share a parking lot with some other stores so a lot of cars pass in front of the entrance while people are trying to get in and out. Doesn't seem very safe sometimes.< /Text>
