Exceptional sushi, artfully crafted, beautifully presented, delicately flavored, and superbly fresh. The proprietor and chef, Aki san, an inspired host, enjoys the art of engaging the customers and refining and enhancing their tasting skills while explaing all things 'sushi', customs, manners, lore, and even Japanese attitudes toward this delicious consumable art.</text>

The total Omakase experience was like having a family reunion over traditional Holiday fixings at Grandpa and Grandma's house, with family from afar.

How the servings of Nigiri were prepared brought smiling faces to the small gathering. The Nigiri, Sake,  beer and wines were never a distraction all evening long, even encouraging comments, thoughts, stories of past experiences, and laughter from those on both sides of the counter.

We will be a repeat customer, like others at the counter! Experience it, and you will too...</review>

<text>Sushi Sho is definitely my favorite sushi experience. It's a slow paced, delicious meal with Aki-San. He's an absolute legend and will tell you about each piece of food you're about to eat, and what to do to have the perfect experience. The cold smoked salmon is a rarity and absolutely amazing. Also, probably the only place to do Anago (marine eel) justice. Everything is delicious. Come in with the mindset to enjoy the experience and savor every bite.

Note: Sushi Sho is by reservation only and, despite the large interior, he only has two seatings per day of 6 people each. This is a personalized dining experience.< /text>< gmapID>

< Review>
Sushi Sho was always my favorite place for sushi when they were located on upper Solano Avenue. I have not visited their new location, which opened after a long pause in between., as I have moved away from the Bay Area. Aki-san is a master sushi chef,  albeit a bit eccentric, and will not settle for anything less than the best quality and dining experience. As he is the only chef preparing food at the counter (with his wife helping out with other chores), Aki-san would rather turn away customers than have them waiting too long. This is why you may see empty spots and yet be turned away. But believe me, you will not find better, fresher fish more expertly prepared than with Aki-san.  Two dishes that stand out, beside all the others, are the Usuzukuri sashimi and the Chawan mushi, a custard with bits of fish and a ginko nut, and probably the best one I've ever had. Lastly, if you ask nicely, you can probably get tamaki  (hand roll) sushi, even though it isn't on the menu.  Sushi-sho is about enjoying the intimate  experience (and the food, of course). You will not find another place like this anywhere.</Review>

5-stars is unequivocal. Aki San had been making sushi for 4 decades. He takes deep pride in making everything from scratch. His own unagi sauce. Cold smoking his own salmon. Sourcing the finest fish. It is a mom and pop tip quality sushi restaurant. Be forewarned... 2 seatings of 6 at the bar only!</text>

Impressive nondescript sushi joint. I've had my fair share of sushi in the Bay, but I'm still thoroughly impressive by it. As of Oct 2013, it'll soon be by reservation only. Call in advance to figure out if that's the case. It's getting too popular, that's why.< /text>

Best sushi I have had on the west coast! The Chef is incredibly friendly and informative about both the food and the formalities of eating sushi. It seems like the restaurant only seats a limited amount of customers at the bar for dinner so make a reservation early!<//Text>

Amazing experience I got. I was taken here for my birthday. I got to try things I probably would have never tried if I picked my own dishes. Omakase was amazing. The chef is fun, entertaining and teaches you so much. All he wants for you is to have the best experience with Sushi.

I came in feeling very intimidated at first but the cheft puts you at ease in no time.

My favorite was this gentle flavored eel. I want to say it wasn't the fresh water one...? It was so pillowy soft. Amazing.<//review>

Reservations only, even though there were at least 10 open tables. Sign prominently posted, $50/person minimum.  No sign of a server, a host, or sushi chef. 6 people sitting at the sushi bar eating well presented sushi.
Stood around and walked around and said hello for a couple minutes...
The only time anyone looked st us was the patrons when we walked out the door.<//text>

<text>An amazing place for sushi. Seriously, Aki-san not only provided fantastic sushi that has ruined all other sushi places for me, but also taught everyone there a lot about sushi. The atmosphere, the service, the food and sake, the entire experience was just amazing!

Oh! And don't forget to make a reservation! Walk-ins are a no go since thay have very limited seating.< /text>< Pictures>

Three stars for the food, but one star for the service. Decent sushi, but terrible service. The sushi chef definitely wants you to believe that he serves the best sushi in the SF Bay Area. He actually got quite confrontational during our meal - consistently questioning how I have had certain dishes before. I told him I have been to other SF sushi joints like Kusakabe, Wako, Hashiri, Maruya, etc. I mean, come on, it's 2017, not 1985. Sushi scene in SF Bay Area has matured significantly.<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Worst service ever. They try to rip you off. No customer service help what so ever. You get there and  they just stare at you. And when you they do ask of you need help they assume you need a new tire without inspecting your actual tire. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELS WHERE. DO NOT GO THIS PLACE.</review><name>M M<//name>< Rate>

<Review>Called ahead of arrival to see if they carried a a certain size in tire new and was quoted $140. I show up to pick up the tires and charge me $150. I dont care about a 10 difference but the fact they don't follow through with what they say. The nice lady who answered the phone even went to ask for the price of the tires so why change price?</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

CAN NOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH, DO NOT GO THERE! DROPPED MY CAR AND THEIR FIRST DIAGNOSTIC WAS, "YOUR CLUTCH NEEDS REPLACEMENT". I WAS WITHOUT A CAR FOR 5 DAYS WHEN I GET A CALL THAT MY TRANSMISSION NEEDS REPLACEMENT.  THEY EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME TO JUST JUNK MY CAR.  I TOOK MY CAR TO DEALER TO GET CHECKED AND THEY DETERMINED THIS SHOP ADDED THE WRONG CLUTCH.  I AM NOW OUT OVER $2000 DOLLARS TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T GO THERE!< /text>

<review>It was a very challenging and fun hike. There is more than enough room for parking, so if you know you're gonna challenge yourself, you can pretty much park next to the entrance of the trail. The hike is ALL uphill and the steep terrain can be very slippery and difficult to navigate. This hike is not easy by any means and nike shoes are definitely not recommended. Once at the top, you have spectacular views of the Burbank, Glendale, and Griffith park areas. This trail even leads up to Mount Thom so if you're feeling extra adventurous, check it out. I definitely recommend.</review><username>Daniel Lamas< /username></record>

The statue of Miss American Green Cross at its trailhead is a beautiful reminder of early American reforestation history. Sculpted by Frederick Willard Potter in 1928 as a symbol of conservation movement in the U. S. and particularly Glendale to save the forests of America.</text>

Multiple trails of varying difficulty - 2-3 hour hike to the top and back.  Solid trail for beginners with great views of Los Angeles.<//Text>

Good short trail (approx. 2 km loop). Amazing views especially when it's green. There are steep portions but doable for most.< /review>

Great hike, it can be steep at a few parts but overall a wonderful hike. You'll be able to see an amazing view of Los Angeles, Glendale and so much more. There are several break spots along the hike and at the bottom is a nice park, grilling area and library.</text>

hidden gem of a hike behind the suburbs of glendale! free parking near the library. i saw two trailheads, my friend and i took the "seven trees one." it is quite steep so beware. wear proper shoes, bring sunscreen, and water for sure! the path is dirt/gravel so can be slippery at times. the views of glendale/burbank are pretty neat! unfortunately, it was quite smoggy today. there are many forks in the road, with not too much signage. my friend and i ended up going higher up the mountain and traversed along the verdugo motorway and the brand motorway, until finally making it back to the parking lot (7 miles). more signs/maps would be helpful... we were scared we got lost a few times! there were not too many people on the trail, which was nice. also water fountains/restrooms would be great additions to the trails!<//text>

Personally, after hiking the Henry Cook Lookout Point, I wasn’t too impressed by this Brand trail. Don’t get me wrong- it’s a good trail that has a great view- but the big payoff view takes too long to get to. I was looking for a shorter trail that gave me the exact same thing that this trail did. Would recommend for more avid hikers with a lot of time on your hands.< /Text>

It is relatively short, but hard enough if you take the left path on the way top. I recommend that you take the left way at the initial point, and take the right path - from the top it's the left one - on the way down. Not that impressive, but still wonderful scenic view of downtown LA, Burbank, and Glendale at the same time from the top.< /Text>

It is very inclined/steep so make sure you wear the correct shoes. It's very beautiful once you get to the top.<//text>

Good hike but a little steep on the uphill side (going counter clockwise).  Not sure it would have been any better as a downhill though.<//text>

Hiking couldn't be any closer if you live in Glendale and the surrounding area. What a workout hiking to the top of the Verdugos and the best part? It's free!👍Cheers😊<//text>

An Honest Hiking Review:

To be quite frank, this was quite a disappointing trail. While it markets itself as family friendly, this is clearly a trail for more avid hikers that takes much time to get to. We rate this trail hard, and we’re quite disappointed.</text>

this is one of my favourites. it really tests your endurance. it you want to get the most out of it i recommend taking a back pack with a little bit of waight on it. 5lbs or 10. what ever you feel comfortable with. truat me you can only get better. good luck and have fun<//review>

Doelger senior center is a great place to eat lunch at reasonable price. Besides that it is a place to get brown bag and a place to learn.<//review>

Attended a baby birthday party here.  The parents rented the space and had food caterers set up food prepared elsewhere and served warm here over sterno.  Parking was easy.  Space in the inner courtyard for kids to spread out and play.  Very family friendly location.<//Review>

Although it says "Senior Center", it also has things for teens and kids like a summer volunteer program, basketball, tennis, and baseball. There is also the Daly City Parks and Rec office there so you can register for activities too.</text>

I came here during restaurant week and absolutely loved this hidden gem! They are part of Mission Bay Resort and located right on the water. You can't beat the view and ambiance! Loved the Nobel Sunset cocktail -- super refreshing and not too sweet. The mac & cheese and flat iron steak were delicious, as well (the flat iron steak comes with a bomb chimichurri sauce)! Their happy hour is Sun-Thurs from 2-5pm with drink specials.<//text>

Great location for good food and a staycation.  Clam chowder was delicious and so was the steak frites.   Had the chocolate ganache which was a a multitude of amazing flavors all wrapped in one (sweet, salty, and savory) and they all complimented it each.  It was also a large amount of ganache but I'm not complaining.  Had a taste of the sorbet as well and that was delicious. A little too sweet for me but still very delicious.  Service was good and it looked like they have good pizzas as I saw a ton of patrons ordering them.  Be prepared to not park at the hotel unless you're a guest.  Would definitely go back again and again.<//Review><Rate>4<//Rate></record>

The facility itself is nice, staff are great, but prices are outrageous. The photos are of a $25 meal. I was shocked when I got to my room and saw how small everything was. The salad was literally just the heart of one romance lettuce head. The tiramisu was a pudding cup size. Drive elsewhere to eat.</review>

< review>
The bartender treated us like we were bothering him. When we asked for a couple of straws, he literally threw them at us. The food was edible. The shrimp were overcooked and rubbery, but the noodles were ok. The parmesan garlic fries were good. The Crab cake was good. Not mouthwatering,  but edible.  But for $128 I'd expect good service with a smile, and great food. I'd give it zero stars if I could.  I wont ever be back.</review>

We shared a burrata and a beet salad (the walnuts in the best salad were unbelievable) and then I had the duck whilst she had scallops and shrimp.

<text>Man was that steak delicious and juicy and perfectly prepared. I had the steak fries and it was amazing. Big portion and the fries were decent. Served with ketchup, a garlic aioli would have been a wonderful compliment. I've been here many times, but have only ever had the fixed price menu provided by the company I work for. That is always really good, but nothing compared to this meal. I'm also a really big fan of the breakfast buffet. Great quality of foods for any restaurant, let only on a buffet.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Absolutely fabulous!  Perfect view on the deck with fire pit and heaters nearby for a romantic and festive feeling. The food was amazing!  We were celebrating our 25 year anniversary and husbands birthday which I had noted on our Open Table reservation so shortly after seating us they arrived with glasses of prosecco!  After dinner we ordered dessert and when we  got the check that was complimentary too. Servers were incredible and were a great team working together to make it a perfect night. Thank you California Aqua Bistro!<//Text>

<review>Horrible service!! We waited for 5 minutes for the hostess to appear, yet the place was almost completely empty. No one acted as if we were visible. Once we were seated, waiters walked by me but never looked or aporoached for 10 minutes. Finally Sven came over & said it wasn't his section but that Nick was busy so he would take my order. What Nick was busy with is a mystery but eventually- after forgetting to get my daughter's milk & then forgetting to order her food- we ate.
Food is good. Views are nice. Service horrible! This was my second time there & my last.</review>< Pics>

<user_name>Travis Anderson< /user_name><rate>5</rate><review>Had a wonderful experience. You can tell they use multiple techniques for every plate. We had the burrata mozz caprese. Wagyu burger and the kids had linguini Alfredo with vegetables. All we're cooked spot on. The pasta was Al dente, caprese was season well and had appropriate proptions per ingredient used. I asked for medium rare on the burger. They also have wine pairings with each dish. Which I personally enjoy seeing people taking the extra time to offer pairings.  Service was great. Waiter was there within 3 minutes and knew when to come and when to stay away. He had a great sense of humor with the kids which you don't see often. If I had to find a downside I would say some of there prices were a little high. But worth it regardless. Great end to a vacation</review>< Pictures>

The waiter was very stand offish and absent. We had to wait 20 minutes before he came and took our order for drinks, so we sat outside in the sun without drinks. When we received what we asked for the order was wrong. The burger we ordered had none of the toppings we had asked for on it. So we asked the waiter and he got annoyed and asked a different server to bring us what we asked for. We are a younger couple and were clearly not as wealthy as the people sitting around us. But we are still paying customers. The waiter was very stand-offish to us and left us with distaste in the service and in the meal we received. This place lacks customer service unless you look like you have money.<//text>< gmapID>

The price did not match the food quality. Chicken was tough. Gluten free pasta came in a watery sauce that was over run buy the taste of olives. Kobe burger got two thumbs up. Service was great.</Text>

Pull up to restaurant's edge on your boat, dock, and walk in.
Pleasing aesthetics, nice decor.
Gorgeous hostess (though dimwitted) smiled and welcomed us.
Food is tasty, with generous portions for an upscale restaurant.

- CONS -
Touristy, with above-average prices.
Nickel and dime ya for everything.

I thought our experience was enjoyable, however the one bitter taste in my mouth was the bus boy's lethargic and almost abrasive manner in which he asked about our water preferences. Our choices were "tap" or "avian." The usual, though he managed to make us feel like second-class citizens if we dare replied with "tap." Also, our waiter came by, and after we ordered beers, which he grossly miscalculated on price (he said $6-7, though they were $9) he asked if we'd "like some bread for the table?" Sure! However, once we go the bill we realized we were charged $5 for bread. The waiter implied it was free, yet there it is, $5.00, for 4 slices of bread. Jeez.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The food is actually pretty good considering it's in a hotel, the atmosphere is a 9 out of a 10, this service is somehow always slightly lacking and always behind. However having eaten here several times the wait staff will warm up to certain people. It's a good place for a business lunch but it's a bad place to get drunk.</review>

The good: The view, the setting, the decor,  the beautiful and sweet Australian waitress,  and the burger!!  The burger was huge incredible!!
The bad: The sea bass was boring and tasteless.  Other than the burger the other dishes were small,  and and not very good. They served asparagus that was way under cooked.
Oh, and the hostess seemed like we were bothering her.< /text>

Wasn't impressed. Went there last week and they overcharged us for breakfast. I didn't have coffee but it was added on our bill. The waiter was so slow and we were with a large party that it wasn't worth my time to ask him to fix our check. He, also, added on a 18% gratuity and didn't tell our table until people started questioning the price. $37 for one breakfast buffet is outrageous.....especially when it was your basic eggs, meat, pancakes.<//text>

<Text>Hard to make phone reservations. (Minus1 star) and tge phone operator was condescending...yes, i have heard of web reservations. There was no dialtone for the restaurant. Sevice was very nice though. Italian waiter, Riccardo, spoke to me un his language and even made an amazing attempt in Spanish. Busser was very good and filled us in on local activities. They suggested good food pairing items. Food was very good! Kid service 4 my friend's son was exceptional...they really went out of their way with the firepit and heat lamps and seated us close to it. The ambiance was so nice...but it was a calm evening; around 6pm on Sunday.<//Text>< Pics>

Seating was good and service was decent, but we felt rushed to turn the tables.  Our complaint was the meal.  They only had a thankgiving meal which was expected.  The portion was 3 thin sliced pieces of turkey breast, 2 esperagaus spears and a half a cup of sweet potatoes for $50 a plate.   This was a disappointing meal for the price and really was a disappointment.  We also asked to validate our parking pass which the waiter said he did and we still had to pay to get out of parking area.

<text>This restaurant is perfect if you're staying at Mission Bay Resort otherwise I'm not sure it's worth travelling just to visit Covewood for the food with so many great options in San Diego, however to meetup and have a drink, this checks all the right boxes.
Covewood has a very comfortable and stylish vibe. The outdoor seating has firepits and views galore. The entrees are small in portions and if you're really hungry, I'd suggest going elsewhere. The food does have amazing taste, you won't be disappointed in that department. They did have a kids menu so overall Covewood is great. I think the only drawback is the portion sizes, it's really more like a place to have appetizers and drinks with a great vibe and views.
If you're staying at the Hotel, then this is a must visit at Sunset.</text>< pics>

Like to say thank you to Doreen. She was very polite and made an extra effort for me to get a unit the size I needed.  There wasn't one available when I went in to the office the first time but she let me know as soon as one came available she'd give me a call. That's what she did ....about a week later. This place is clean, staff is friendly,and very helpful. Thank you Purely storage.<//review>

Astounding customer service.
Phenomenal place. Since the moment you call to ask
for something to the moment you received your lock keys(which by the way you get a free lock) you will get an exceptional service. The place is secured and monitored. Price is great, no hidden fees. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for self storage!!! Thank you once again Theresa. Your awesome.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great customer service!
Doreen answered all my questions & concerns with complete detail over the phone & in person. As soon as I was onsite Doreen walked me through the contract process & gave me a tour. Rented my unit with complete confidence it's in a safe place plus purchased insurance just in case because things happen. Just don't pay in advance No Refunds for pre-paid months!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I had an excellent experience when I walked into the storage facility. The receptionist Antonia answered all my questions and help me into my decision for a unit that fit my needs. She took her time in giving me a tour and made it fast and simple.<//review>

< Review>
This is one of the best storage facilities I've ever used!! Great prices and clean units!!!
Me and family recently relocated from Bakersfield to Shafter and were down sizing. But we didn't want to lose things we cherish doing so (like my grandmas antique china cupboard and paintings she left me) so we began the hunt for a storage facility near our new home. I called around a few places. They were either to far or the person on the phone was just rude. So i decided to stop in a place and hope for the best. Purely Storage on Elm was the first place i actually went into and I was super relieved to find the help i needed. The manager was was knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions with certainty. She was polite, courteous, and very patient, as i had my 2 boys with me who are very energetic lol. Thank you Theresa Soerjono for making my move easier!!<//Review>

<text>I am giving Best Choice Storage II a five star rating as the manager, Ashley  was very accommodating with me when I had to get a second storage unit.  She worked with me with the rent/deposit payment since I work outside the area.  Ashley was absolutely wonderful with working with my mother on my behalf in paying for the second storage unit as well as having a lock there inside the office to purchase for the second storage unit.  Ashley is an absolute Pleasure to talk to or when I see her in the office.  She ALWAYS accommodates me no matter my situation and has made my life a lot easier.  I know that my furniture and other belongings are always safe.  That is "Huge" for me, but what else is "Huge" for me is your Amazing Customer Service you provide to me.  Ashley is an "Awesome Manager" at Best Choice Self Storage II and her Supervisor should be very happy with the Great Customer Service that she Always provides not only to me, but to everyone who has a storage unit here.< /text>< pictures>

I stopped by to check out pricing and the facility. Ashley was so professional with all my questions and concerns. When I called the day I was supposed to come in for my appointment  to rent. I explained to her that I didnt need it anymore. She congratulationed me on my house and was very professional. If I ever need to store anything I will be calling best choice storage 2!< /text>

I have had a storage unit here at Best Choice Self Storage II for 1 1/2 years now and it's been a very wonderful experience.  It is convenient and close to where I live, so if I want to go check on my things in my storage unit, pay my monthly bill, talk to manager on site, take any of my personal items out of my storage unit, etc... it's been an absolutely easy and stress free experience.  I personally feel that my personal items/things are safe and secure.  The facility grounds are always clean and kept up.  It is easy access to get inside and outside the gate.  I personally like the variety of ways to pay your monthly storage bill.  You can pay by phone, by Best Choice Self Storage II website, or you can just come into the onsite office and speak to the manager.  I highly recommend Best Choice Self Storage II to everyone.< /text>

I have been with best choice storage for 5 years. They accommodated me when I needed to downsize. And also receiving a great fantastic deal. Never had anything stolen always Security on site. Feel safe when I go there due to all the cameras they are a five star in my book. Sincerely Granny R.</text>

Not my favorite place.  Three of the lights out of the four in my row do not work.  The latch is very hard to operate and I spend at lease 3 minutes every time I open or close the unit, just to get it to work.   It was like that when I rented the unit and was told that's the way it works.  As for pricing, what they say and what they charge are two different things.  I used them because they were close, but never again.  Seems like corporate employees and not locally owned.  They just don't care.<//review>

Kyle has treated me with respect from day one. i have had a storage unit there for approx. a year now. I have had trouble keeping up with payments now and then. It has been a long year. But every time i get that phone call from Kyle saying "Your payment is past due." He ALWAYS has a cheerful, thoughtful voice that can make a phone call like this almost pleasant.

<Text>Great storage units, decent price, good secure location.  Only bad point is the website, it was non user friendly before but the current system is a mess.  It takes forever to get into my account to pay my bill.  If it would at least remember my login info, or not block my browser from automatically entering it, that would be great.

Still the best storage units in the area though.  I had issues with my classic car being stripped at another storage place in town years ago (the one near the 10th st bridge in YC) and have been very nervous about using storage units since then.  In the last 3+ years I have not heard about a single issue.< /Text><date>1466562990154</date>< response>

This a wonderful store to buy designer without the price tag.  It is similar to other sell/trade clothing stores, but think "high class".  Designer names at reasonable prices and most of the items are in excellent or new condition.</review>

<text>I enjoy this place.  Very well organized however have brought cute clothes in and they were either too youthful or not a top name brand.....at the same time there's a cashmere sweater on display with moth holes in it. Little on the pricey side.

I took in some beautiful items of clothing but because none of them had designer labels that matched “their franchise designer label list”, all of my items were rejected. Clothes Mentor TV ad of course has no mention of this policy.Total waste of my time!<//Text>

GUESS WHAT- I just walked out to write this review because they decided to purchase a Calvin Klein overnight bag of mine... and APPARENTLY a lulu lemon clutch.... BUT I did not know about the clutch when I accepted the [insulting] offer, it was not until I then proceeded to make sure all of my items were returned to me. When I went back in the store to ask if they were also purchasing the lulu item, I was informed that the offer was for both items and the girl at the register failed to see both items. I was not even apologized to, so I should have assumed they wouldn’t have offered to remedy the situation. I have only come here with items after that aren’t selling quickly to my 150k+ Poshmark followers and I will NEVER return again. I would rather an item sit online for purchase (AND NEVER BE PURCHASED) than receive another disrespectfully low low low offer & the stuck up, enticed attitude of the woman who runs the place. Best of luck keeping the doors open.</text>

This shop has the most interesting finds. I love to take my time and browse through everything. I always leave with something.
The customer service is very sweet and attentive.
This is a must visit when visiting the desert.<//review>

Buy Sell high end designer clothes, shoes, hats and jewelry. If you ate a professional, realtor corporate executive who can't always afford designer labels at exorbitant $$$$$$ prices, check out Clothes Mentor !  Gently worn or never worn the buyers carefully scrutinize, by research of labels WHAT they buy...the snowbirds lend a great deal of quality inventory as they leave town each year. Oh, did I mention Lady's Golf ?<//text>

It's like a pawn shop, but you can find some really awesome stuff in there! It's mostly all new, and well cared for items. I might come back for some Tiffany jewelry I saw in there.<//review>

First of all when I just walked in they didn't greet me or anything!!! the manager was straight whispering in another employees ear in front of me so rude !!! So i drop off my clothes so they can check it. Fast forward They text me saying my clothes is ready.i get their and the employee tells me that their going to pass on my clothes because it's too young🤭. So I asked, so you guys just buy older people clothes and the girl said basically 😂 like whatttt wow thank you for waisting my time. It's false advertisement they should put only senior clothes up In The front window !!!!<//review>

I cleaned out my closet and took a basket of 29 items in; all clean, folded, some in dry cleaner bags. All are nice name brands like J Crew, White House/Black Market, BCBG. The woman who took them in, Teresa, told me it would take 45 minutes to do the intake/pricing. I decided to wait in the store. The store was empty, save for one other shopper who didn't buy anything and a lady who brought in a purse which they rejected and she left. Meanwhile, my basket remained untouched while the two staffers chatted with each other and messed around with hangers. I got the distinct impression that neither of them wanted to bother with the pricing, and each was waiting for the other to go do it. After half an hour, Teresa went over to the basket, lifted the top item and looked at the tag, ran her finger down the stack in the basket, lifted one corner, and called me over and told me they wouldn't be taking any of them because they are "out of date."  I guess she is psychic, since she did not bother to remove or unfold a single item to look at it.
I felt this was extremely disrespectful to me as a customer. If it was too much work to take in items on their shift, I wish they had told me when I came in, instead of keeping me waiting and wasting a half hour of my time. I will not be back.</Text>

Very rude customer service. They have old frumpy merchandise and told me my clothes were not in style. Most had been purchased within 6 months and certainly are stylish. I would rather donate then sell for $2<//text>

I was in the other day and spotted a fake Louis Vuitton wallet. When I told the girl, she ignored me and put it back on the shelf!!! I have many LV and Gucci product and trained to spot fakes. They either don’t know what they are doing and buying, it super shady. Either way, beware!!< /text>

The items I brought in we all brand new with tags.   What they offered was a joke.   I would rather donate them give them these items for a dollar.     It was crazy.  Then I looked around at the clothes in there. I surely wouldn't buy there.    Beware.  They also offer you more if you want store credit instead.   The gal looking over my items looked like she didn't even shop there.   Either do a garage sale or sell online.  Or donate and get a tax write off.

I definitely agree with most of the comments about the store I for one have provided clothes shoes a lot of nice things to sell to the store and I was not provided the customer service I would not provided the amount of what I paid for there’s so much you could do with under $100 when you’re providing a company $800 worth of merchandise Branielle like I said please stay far away from the store be aware of the manager  The owner Stephanie !!!!! DONT GO SHOPPING AT THIS STORE !!!!!<//Text>

Came here today and they  told me they will give a price for the clothes I brought in about 30 minutes to and hour. So I left came back after and hour and they still had me waiting in the store for 10 minutes after the hour. When they were ready they just told me very rudely  that they did not accept juniors clothing, I told the lady well that is what I wear, I am very small  and on your website it does not say that. They did not care about customer service and they do not explain things before you you go through the hassle of leaving your clothes and waiting until they are ready to assist you. Such a bad place to consider and a  rip off.<//Review>

Good place.. They don't give much for items you bring in and they dont but some of the cloths that are in trend which is kinda weird when u start looking around and they have items that haven't been in trend for a long time. They need to have a better clearance section. Some of the prices are good though and its always very organized for the most part. Thats always a plus when shopping at a 2nd hand store..< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I came in today because I got an email they were having a sale 50% off clearance items and 20% off other apparel. I picked out a bit of items, all but 1 was regular price which would give me a 20% off that item, the girl ringed me up I paid and after I checked my receipt and I noticed she didn’t discount the 20% off, I told the girl and she told the owner in which the case she said that because I paid with card it would be difficult to fix it and she offered me $5 off my next purchase. I refused the coupon and she rudely told the girl to give me the difference cash. She didn’t apologize nor did she acknowledge me after that. I went into the store because of the email I got about the discounts however I will never go back to this place ever again. I spent almost $100 and I got very rude service and I agree 100% with the other reviews, the worst customer service ever. I will never be back even if they have a 90% off. Don’t go here.<//Text>< pictures>

Overall, the pizza was delicious and filling. The crust was not too thin and not too thick, and perfectly cooked. The sauce tasted unique although I prefer a bit more spice in my sauce. Good and efficient service too<//Review>

First, let me say that I feel that I am a Pizza Connoisseur. I love PIZZA and I love seeking out great pizza places. With that being said... this place absolutely ROCKS! I wasn't for sure, before eating there, if this was just going to be another pizza place with just okay" pizza. However< /Review>

For kosher pizza, it's pretty good. Compared to non kosher pizza, it's bland and expensive. Other foods are generally pretty good. Large selection of vegetarian foods, including Mexican, Greek salad, stuffed pretzels and desserts. Order at the counter and they'll bring you the food, but that's about all the service you'll get. They won't check on you, and if it's crowded you'll be lucky even to get a cup of water. Id recommend taking your food to go rather than eating there.</text>

<Review>The Pizza here taste very good and total different than anywhere else. At the time of writing this review this fast food is kosher certified. The quality of food is good but the only problem is just sometimes the wait to get your food is little bit high. Again I have ordered food many times here but just sometimes I think they are very busy and cannot handle it. Most Important to me is the quality of food and cleanness which is acceptable here.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c299885f880eeb:0x74d9fc7102eb1113</GmapID></record>

I eat in this spot a lot since I work close by. I got to say the service is always awesome and they keep the spot clean consistently. Rates are reasonable and they serve big portions.</review>

<Review>This place is a hidden gem in the valley. All kosher which makes it suitable for Muslims like me as well. They go as all vegetarian but they do have meat and Chicken (soy) substitutes. I tried their Malawashi (excuse my misspelling if any) without veggies and loved it.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Bh Still delicious..but portions significantly reduced but prices went up. Take lasagne. When we inquired, cashier stated it's always been that size which is false as we've been coming for years ...and easily shared the dish with salad and bread rolls between 2 people.
We hope its not going the way of Jerasalem Pizza who did the same and ultimately lost patrons...
Still great kosher pizza!!!  No short cuts there! So for that we will return bn!< /text>

I love this place. It is affordable, good quality pizza & a variety of other choices. I've had pretty much all the menu items and enjoy them all. I go there 2 or more times a week. Basic food without fancy ambiance. They provide some games, & equipment to keep children amused.< /review>

The price is high at both places but Brami's is skimpy on the cheese whereas the other place is not.  The crust is good.  I am also amazed when I read other reviews that say the service is good.  We have never had good service when we come here.
We decided on our last trip that it is worth driving a little further to go to the other kosher pizza place.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Good kosher pizza, not the usual card board tasting that they usually serve in kosher restaurants.  The only problem was that the cashier had no idea about the items on the menu.< /text>

They say Kosher is not the most delicious food. I guess this pizza restaurant do not do a lot to make it different. They are ok. If not for the kosher certification, I'd probably choose another place. Good if you eat kosher, ok if you are not.</Text>

Why does Kosher always equal rip-off? There is no reason that a vegetarian pizza should be over $20 and every other item is at least double what it costs anywhere else. When a menu item says it contains certain ingredients, it should! Our Greek Salad did not have any red onion. And a Greek Salad doesn't have Ranch dressing, folks. We weren't even given a choice of dressing. Why don't you have a real Greek dressing? When you list "chicken" you must say it's tofu. So why do you call it "chicken"?  The pizzas we got were not cooked long enough.

The food is pretty good, that much I'll give Brami's. But the price is outrageous, insulting. For 2 vegetarian pizzas, an eggplant parm, 3 salads, it cost around $90. Come on - get real, Brami's.< /text>

I ordered 4 pizza over the phone for birthday party  , 4 kind (eggplant,vegetable, Mushrom ) total $70.36 charged , I had birthday party , when I opened the boxes with my guests, I found  4 simple uncooked pizza, no onion no eggplant no mushrooms, no green olives and nothing more,,,,.... just uncooked pizza classic cheese ..
I didn't know what to do ,  when I called .. he just mentioned, human can make a mistake and didn't help me.....I am very unhappy with his service , do not trust this place at all , your guests might go home hungry....... ,I paid full price for nothing , is it Kosher pizza!!!! how do you know?</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) First time I place an order more than 24 hours in advance and they did not have it on time my guests had to wait for more than 45 min to be able to eat, the pizzas, the fries, etc, etc, .. Very rich but the service by phone the worst

I usually never leave negative reviews but felt my voice needed to be heard here.  But first the good news... We ate outside and it was lovely, a beautiful place in midtown, most of the servers were nice and did check on us... I say “servers” because you are not assigned one.  Although the food was good ... order the salmon bowl, it was delicious... my enchiladas were just okay... the requirement to order everything through the app was just so impersonal.  They are trying to reach out to the younger crowd, but what about us mid-lifers who actually have the money to spend at these more upscale Mexican restaurants?  I want to order with a server who can take all my special requests without having to navigate my phone app wearing my “readers”.  This is not just a Covid  thing, we asked one of five servers  who came to check on us.  This is the way it is.  A sign of the future? II sure hope not.</review>

A great brunch place if you are around the area or it's even better if you live around there because you don't have to look for breakfast. I met up with my friend here to grab some lunch. The hardest part about this place is finding parking, I parked in a paid structure since it was easier. We got seated outside and had to scan a QR code for the menu. I got the French Toast with water because I saw getting a Pepsi was pretty pricy. The French toast was delicious especially since I haven't had it in a while. The chips and salsa was also great. Our server came back frequently to check on us. You put your oder through the website so everything is all done digitally.<//text>

<review>We were seated promptly on a busy evening. Hot chips served with warm bean dip and salsa served in stylish bowls were brought out right away. We were able to order and pay through our phones. I liked that there were many ways to alter the meal. Food came out in good time. Service was friendly. The ambiance was unique and cool. Great place for a date.</review>< pictures>

Great place with great food.  Love coming here.  But their new ordering system on your phone sucks!!!!    I come to a nice restaurant for the hospitality and social aspect.   Not to order on a phone.  Won’t be coming back until this is changed back to normal.< /text>

A very popular place for #tacotuesday & Cinco de Mayo in Sacramento! I'm not even a sweets-kinda-person but their churros tastes amazing & will melt in your mouth. When it comes to ordering salads, get your dressing on the side because they can a bit heavy handed.<//Review>

I hope the owner of this restaurant is paying attention.
You are losing 15% of sales because you're forcing people to order from an app and that's on a regular day you're losing 20 to 25% on a busy day.

I work for a data collector where it shows that people are less willing to buy more food or drinks from an app.

Being served at a restaurant by a waitress is part of the full  restaurant experience  technology will never replace comfort or a waiter. A waiter can just get more food or drinks by just asking him which leads to more food and drink sells.

I will also stop leaving tips for waitresses or Waiters if they don't take my order.

Let your Waiters serve their customers and let customers have a full restaurant experience where they're willing to spend more money if they had a real menu in front of them.< /review>

Excellent customer service from host stand to server. Terrie the bartender is such an experienced down to earth bartender that can make any drink you desire. The ambiance and vibe this place sets off is iconic and I will continue to return because of Terrie the bartender.  From the moment you walk in you feel the "welcome back" feel. Even on your first time. 5 stars for quality food taste, bar drinks and server experience.</Review>

I love this place! I came here a few years ago and it was delicious and I always talked about it with friends, so I'm glad that after visiting again last night it held up to the hype and memories 🥰 such great service and great food! We got the shrimp tacos and the mole enchiladas. So much food, the portions are huge! We had to move to the bar because the table we were sitting at could accommodate up to 10 people (and it was just us 2) so they covered the pitcher of beer we had ordered! Definitely going to keep hyping about it lol can't wait to go back<//text>

Nice ambiance, food and drinks were exceptional, wait staff was friendly, and turn around times minimal. The hive mind approach to food service, paired with the scan then order by phone system is not conducive to seperate checks. The drinks were especially unique, and all seemed seasonally tailored.< /Text>

Delicious. Home made tortillas. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Large outdoor seating area lit up nicely to create a nice ambience.

Did I mention delicious? Reasonably priced.

Tried it for the 1st time and fell in love. The carnitas tacos are the best and cant complain about anything. The service is always great even when its busy. Love this place and will always make the trip from Stockton to here to eat and enjoy myself. I highly recommended this place.<//Review>

This is one of Northern California's best Mexican restaurants. The order and pay options have changed so be ready to order and pay through your phone. Every dish I've ever had here is about as close to authentic as you will ever find. This restaurant has always had good vibes! My favorite in Sacramento CA.</review>

Yum! I highly recommend the chicken mole.
The only reason it's not full five stars is because of covid and the required outdoor seating.  The set up wasn't optimal for outdoor seating.</review>

Love this restaurant for a night out. Delicious food and great atmosphere, even with COVID restrictions. They have a large outdoor seating area with heat lamps that is just as nice as sitting indoors (weather permitting). The only downside is if you're seated in the outdoor area that's on the street. It isn't quite as nice, but there's only so much restaurants can do during these times. The food is still as great and the service is always wonderful.< /text>

The Outdoor seating area was legit, and they have done a really nice job making it feel like a nice dining experience, but the food was just ok. It seems like they cut the menu in half at least and again... the food was good.. but I've been here many times before Covid and the food was really great. I hope they expand their menu back to what it used to be soon.< /text>

Used to love this place, but the Food has degraded in quality (even got food poisoning after). Service is negligible… order through the cumbersome website and they’ll drop it off. Forgot something or have questions? Good luck.<//text>

Food was good, but all the chips were stale and the chips for the ceviche. The ordering system is nice and easy, all on your phone. The waiter for our table came by introduced himself said, after your food is delivered to your table I will come and make sure you don't need anything and we never saw him again. One person gave us our food, while a different person gave us our drinks. But our actual waiter never came back . We had to keep flagging people down for service.</review>

<text>This is a bar, that serves food bc to call it a restaurant is honestly just disrespectful. Plastic plates, tiny drinks In more plastic, and oh yeah the utensils plastic. I got served 3 tacos on a cold tortilla, bland meat. At least the rice and beans were decent and I was STARVING. anyway overall so  not worth the 55$ price tag</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

One of the best Mexican Restaurant I have visited. I really liked the high ceiling, palm trees, flower arrangement at the entry. We were blown away by the looks. Then 8 of us, pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Food was extremely tasty. Service was simply great. We enjoyed the pitcher of Margarita suggested by waitress. We really enjoyed our meal here. Highly recommend this place.<//review>

<review>1st time here.  Service was superb. Tacos are excellent, should be 3 per order instead of 2, though. Wasn't impressed with the rice,  but overall, not bad. I'll visit again.< /review>< pictures>

The food was great but the online ordering and paying system makes you feel like your paying for door dash and having it delivered to your table.  It is very impersonal and frustrating.  Whoever thought this was a good idea for restaurants is way off base for what customers want in there dining out experience.  You Mays as well stay home and order online to have it delivered.< /review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Was there last night and didn’t have the best experience this used to be our go to place but recently I’ve had more than one bad experience here. I got a steak burrito from here and for some reason the steak was extremely dry and didn’t taste fresh it was actually kind of hard which made me not want to keep eating it! Next almost every table had a heater except ours and once I asked for one they said unfortunately they were all being used  so my fiancée and I had to freeze  while eating and waiting for our food! Lastly no one came to check on us  and none of our drinks were refilled the entire night! Paid top dollars for a place with not the best service!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

We went for happy hour and had outdoor seating due to COVID. Food was great, servers were great and friendly, but the hostess who who greeted us upon arrival was not welcoming at all. We almost cancelled our reservations because of her ridiculous demands of having us go outside before she can take our names. Very unprofessional when there was no line and she was inside. If she wanted the line outside then she should have been outside waiting for guests to arrive. Instead of redirecting us to meet her outside.<//text>

<text>I cannot express my gratitude to Zocalo Midtown.  I was in need of place to seat 16 for a baby sprinkle last minute, there was a mishap at the restaurant I original reserved.  I made a quick call to Zocalo Mid Town and boy did they come through...the host knew I was stressed and did everything to make comfortable and to accommodate me.  The venue was beautiful, we were offered outdoor seating and staff assisted with with all our decor and setting.  They turned a stressful situation to a beautiful, memorable one.  Zocalos exceeded our expectations in every possible way,  I will forever be grateful to them.  The food was also amazing!  I again thank you for a wonderful baby sprinkle, and appreciate you all so much!   Cheers to Zocalo's and their wonderful team!</text><Name>Sunny Sangha<//Name>< user>

Did I mention delicious? Reasonably priced.

This place has great food however they target minorities. My husband and I were there gor dinner Thursday night. We have seen many people around us get up and go (pay Is online) however when we got up to leave ; they stopped us since I am Hispanic and he is black. No one around us has been questioned, why us? We had left a 20% tip and we stood there in embarrassment for 10 minutes while they figured it out. Not ok, we left completely  embarrassed. If you can’t figure out your online payment system charge people with their cards. If you are a minority you will be targeted. Do not go.</text>

One of the best mexicans restaurants in town and super fancy. The decoration is amazing, they put so much effort on it. The food is incredible. The best : the multiple options for margaritas, the rice they serve always is green rice with a exquisite touch of cilantro, and the tortillas are home made. Never tried tortillas better than the ones that they have! My favorite Mexican place in Sacramento.<//text>

<Review>Extremely disappointed with the food! I ordered the posole and it was absolutely gross. What I got was a warm, thick, enchilada paste with meat and hominy. It was so thick and pasty I actually had the server bring me hot water in a tea pot to try and make it more like a broth. It did not work. The server even offered to bring me more water. It did not even look like posole. It was a warm, flavorless dish. Needless to say I did not eat it. My friend had the Guanajuato (green) enchiladas. The were served barely warm with again a thick green paste that tasted bitter. It was as if they just blended tomatillos and made the sauce. The tortillas were so hard, she couldn’t even cut thru them. The meat was barely warm. It was disgusting.  I want my money back!! I was too embarrassed to tell the server to take back the plates. What a waste of an afternoon. It was a holiday and a beautiful sunny day and turned out to be a waste of day here at Zocalo. We will NOT be returning ever!!< /Review>< user_id>

This place is one of my favorite spots in town. Always have good service and most importantly they do have a good food and so much choices when it comes to drink as well. Last time we went there during mothers day weekend. Since it's so busy  it wasn't easy getting a reservation at any restaurants but we got lucky doing reservation   online  at  Zocalo using open table! It's way to go instead of calling around to many places and getting rejected answer. Food was always delish but our waitress  seemed having a bad day so she was kinda rude to us which we ignored it since it was so busy that day. Will still go there regardless of having a bad service for one time.</Review>

I like this spot! They serve high class meals, their menu is large, The chief cook in that restaurant is very experienced, I enjoy a lot eating all their food. The food is consistently of high qualtity, the attitude towards the customers  is efficient. I often eat in this restaurant and I was never discontended. Highly recommended.<//review>

Went for a date night on a Thursday and was pretty happy with everything for the most part. Just a couple of disappointing points on the food.. the chips before the meal were cold and didn't taste very fresh. I ordered the mole enchiladas with chicken and cheese and--while the filling was delicious--the mole was overly sweet and was lacking any hint of chili peppers. The cilantro rice was definitely delicious and kind of stole the show on the plate for flavor.

If you're going to have a drink, I would highly recommend the blackberry margaritas, they're tart and delicious! I had mine with the casamigos silver tequila and it was fantastic. Our server was also attentive and kind. Great service overall even though they were very busy!</review>

Since you don't have a waitress or waiter take your order & you're using the QR code to order; they should be a little more diligent in letting the customers know when it's last call. Besides that, both food & drinks were delish!< /Review>

Great food and a great experience!  In general, everything I had was good.  Of special mention was the salsa and the queso.  2 things I LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Both full of flavor and different from the run of the mill versions.  I had a pork shoulder for my lunch and it was moist and tasty as well.  Try this place, it's good.< /Review>

Attempted to have dinner here last night at 515 with my family of 5. Was asked if we had reservations. We said no but there were many open tables. They told us to wait a bit. AFter 10 minutes when no one else arrived I asked what was going on I was again asked if I had a reservation. I again said no but metioned that there were many open tables. The rude server told me witha big smile that  they were all full and we  could have a table in abouat 2.5 hourss. Would we mind waiting?Monday night at 530 and they let a party of 5 walk...I will never return.< /Text>

Besides the fact that Zocalo's had some of the freshest food I've ever had, the atmosphere was incredible.  My girlfriend and I went for brunch  and I ordered the CARNITAS CON HUEVOS, a
Tender pork mixed in a chipotle sauce, sautéed onions and poblano chiles. IT WAS AMAZING!  Not to mention the service that Sierra Pedley gave us was 10/10.  Will definitely make this a normal brunch spot in the future.<//Text>

If you want to experience a very cool Mexican decor coupled with outstanding Mexican food then this is the place. They offer an endless chips and salsa/bean dip that is solid and tasty. Their food is fresh and  well prepared and not everything smoothed in cheese.  Great and fresh mole, burritos and stuffed peppers.  Highly recommend the location.<//review>

<text>Attempted to have dinner here last night at 515 with my family of 5. Was asked if we had reservations. We said no but there were many open tables. They told us to wait a bit. AFter 10 minutes when no one else arrived I asked what was going on I was again asked if I had a reservation. I again said no but metioned that there were many open tables. The rude server told me witha big smile that  they were all full and we  could have a table in abouat 2.5 hourss. Would we mind waiting?Monday night at 530 and they let a party of 5 walk...I will never return.< /text><time>1614142104063< /time><Gmap_id>0x809ad0db8e85f9d3:0x93970692f99a73a7</Gmap_id><userid>118288638866736759098< /userid></record>

I really enjoy eating here because they always give plenty of chips, dip and salsa while you wait. The portion sizes are hugeeeee!!! There's always enough leftovers for another meal, in my opinion. All of their meats are done well. Dine in options are ~$20 per entree and before covid I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the interiors. Their patio dining is nice and you can order with your phone and also pay with it. Love all of the meat options offered. :)< /review>

Great place but more so because of the ambience.  The food is good and the service was great.  I had the fish tacos and they were tasty.  Proportions were just about right and I left with no doggy bags but the price was a bit higher than average places.  Expect most entrees to be 17-20 dollars so the meal for 2 people would hit $50 for an appetizer plus entrees.  Otherwise I would recommend this place!</Review>

I feel the food lacked flavor and the service was just as bland. For what they charge for a "taco" I would expect a lot more. Just because you spread a little sauce and cabbage on over fried fish doesn't make it baja style. The salsa unfortunately just didn't make the cut either. Would I go back, probably not. On the other hand, the group I was with ordered and really enjoyed the drinks for what ever that's worth.</Review>

< Review>
This is kind of mexican fine dining in terms of how they serve, what they serve. I am a big fan of mexican foods , especially Taco. I think there is some much changes catered to american taste on foods they serve, also they need to improve salsa sauces which tasting bland, mild, not spicy at all. I asked for two different salsas such as Roja, Verde. Both were not that special. Pork shoulder was just collapsing on my tongue which was awesome!! Overall, not that bad, but also not that great!! Cochinita pibil, pozole rojo had very unique, spicy taste to it. Lots of herb, chilies were used but need to be consistent.<//Review>

<Time>1538277639094</Time><rating>5< /rating><text>All i can say is OMG!!!  Got to admit that after my one year stint in Plano, TX, it took about a year before I ever wanted any barbeque or Mexican food.  We have eaten at Tres Hermanos, Chevy's--but hadn't found the favorite Mexican place until by happenstance, we ended up at Zocalo.  Starting with their amazing chips served free with great salsa and bean dip, you can really not go wrong beyond that.  The menu has two traditional soups, 4 ceviche options, tacos, empanadas, burritos, and several special dishes unique to Zocalo.  We tried the shrimp ceviche with Zocalo hot sauce as an appetizer.  A little tip, the hottest ceviche is "Ceviche Verde".  Zocalos hot sauce is not very hot.  The waiting staff was helpful with this choice because my hubby can't take the heat (I will come back for the verde with my son or a friend).

For the main dish, my husband and I shared the enchiladas en mole.  I have had mole dishes in Mexico and in several states in the U.S.  This is by far the best mole ever.  I honestly think I will have dreams about this sauce for days to come.  Sadly, it was so good that I may have difficulty ordering anything else on the menu.  Which is a real shame because that would be way too many options for me to pass up!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great food and an excellent margarita. The ceviche was phenomenal, very fresh, and a very large serving for the price. We split it as an appetizer.
I ordered the burrito and I still have more than half for later, I'm so full it might end up being tomorrow's lunch!
My colleague said the fish tacos we're excellent and had leftovers as well.
The beer selection was a little small, but the tequila selection made up for it.
Beautiful building inside and out with very nice tables and stools, intriguing lighting and a great patio area.
The only drawbacks are that it is quite loud, so it can be challenging to have a conversation, and they were incredibly busy, but the staff seemed to keep up with the people, but much waiting for anything.< /Review>< pictures>

Food was good, portions small, left still feeling hungry.  Parking has never been easy and could be overlooked, but the homeless passed out on the walkway was a bit much.  Plenty of other places just as good and less pricey.< /Review>

I love their drinks and ambient, though the food is too americanized for my taste: too much sauces, mayo, etc. on the tacos and too little cilantro, guacamole, pico de gallo, y queso fresco. But the home made tortillas are great! Atmosphere is very pleasant and stylish, and the fancy selection of margaritas is impressive. I have never been unhappy with any of them so far! Highly recommended for a date, dinner with friends or any other occasion to enjoy a good margarita in midtown.</review>

Food and service was good.  Place was full and pretty noisy so not the best for conversation.  I got the cochinta ...ask for some habanero sauce on the side to add some heat.< /text>

<Text>I have been meaning to try this place for a while. I am not a local, but my past couple of trips here had been pretty short. I did not have the chance to dine in, but trust me when I say I wish I had!! Ordered to go and was ready in 15 minutes. When I got there, the aroma and the stunning decor could only be further impressed by the staff and their warm and friendly demeanor. As I was leaving Los Fabulosos Cadillac began to fill the last of my senses. As we were getting to our hotel, the smell filled the car and literally made my mouth water! We ordered the Tortilla Soup for a rainy day, Enchiladas en Mole and Chile Relleno lunch specials. Let me begin by saying WOW GAME OVER! This is a MUST try when in Sacramento! The taste is not only authentic but left me wanting to dine in and really dive into the full experience. Excellent taste, tender on all bites...wow! I will make some time next time I am in town! The pictures cannot even begin to properly give justice to the taste.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Delicious food, but unfortunately, our waitress was completely MIA most of the time. We finally had to ask the manager to run the cc for our check. The restaurant is beautiful and it can get a bit loud, but it's not overwhelming. We'll be back for the food for sure. The fish tacos are excellent, but the best thing on the menu is the cochinita pibil. The meat is so tender and flavorful.<//review>

This feels weird, but our group of 5 agrees, if you're torn between 4 or 5 stars, just go with 5. This place has the heartiest disposable napkins I've ever felt. Employees DO NOT drink on the job. It may just be the pitcher of margs speaking, but if I lived in Sacramento I feel like id come here a lot.
P.S if you're having a bachelorette party, you should come eat here. You'll love it.</review>< pictures>

<review>Zocalo is one of our fave Mexican food restaurants! Today I was craving a wet burrito and the Asada Burrito hit the spot! Their chips and salsa with bean dip is soooo good and food came in about 10 minutes. 😃 (Good thing cause I was super hungry from having no lunch. We went around 4:30pm.)Go early! Parking can be difficult after 5:00pm, but there’s always the valet parking which is usually the best thing to do here. Enjoy! Delish!!!< /review><Name>Crystal Eidanizadeh</Name>< Pics>

<text>The service is great, very friendly and on top of things. Lovely atmosphere, clean, modern and up scale with in door and out door seating. Classic and blackberry marg were solid. Food was good but nothing remarkable, large portions. Churros for dessert we're good. Overall was a good experience, I'd probably be back but not somewhere I'd come to regularly. Except for drinks, those were great.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Pretty good place! We got two chicken tacos, a bowl, and a quesodilloa (idk why it looks like a burrito). It's a nice place and it has great service, just over priced. Paid $36 for all of this. Happy hour is a great deal. $8 Margaretas and $5 quesodilloa.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwjA97VrwNIXWj5wR3Ev3YejI-TgrFAIz6HQM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSAvKEGL5fexk9tTYKx3zajBcoIQSw074UzXU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeLptxIFLeel-t25k-xnd0hrMC4AijMvzGshk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809ad0db8e85f9d3:0x93970692f99a73a7</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>One of our family favorites for drinks and dinner this restaurant is always very lively that energy is amazing staff is very friendly. And the drinks and the food are quite delicious. Reservations are needed for weekend nights however if you do not have reservations the wait time is typically 30 minutes which is not too bad.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi82x9X7N8Iu6ncRjD0NHYEn8Qdg3w5qr7nSW8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Came here for a birthday celebration on a Saturday night with a party of about 15. I was just a guest so I was able to see the restaurant and how they handle the craziness of a big party during rush. They handled it amazingly efficient. All the food came out within 15 minutes of ordering and all at once - impressive. The food itself was good Mexican food. I wasn’t crazy blown away by anything I ate but I’m also vegetarian and there were only a couple of items on the menu for me. The space for this restaurant is magnificent with gorgeous high ceilings and a large bar. Not a drinker but others in the party seemed to enjoy their specialty drinks. Overall I was impressed with the ambience and service/ kitchen employees.<//review>

<Review>Great food and service. The menu is a lot better then what it was 7 years ago. The food also tastes a lot better. If you go for drinks I have had the mango margarita and the palomas and both were delicious. The only negative comment I have is parking can be difficult,  but they do offer valet and I think it's $5.<//Review></record>

Quick to be seated and served. Tasty not-traditional Mexican food.  Nice decor and ambiance. Indoor and outdoor seating. Finding parking will be a challenge.< /Text>

This restaurant started off pretty good. The chips and dip were great. But when it went towards the main dish, it was just....no. My order tasted like pre-made food that was just warmed up in a microwave. We also ordered nachos that were soggy when they came. I wouldn't trust some of the reviews here. All in all, the food was more for show than taste.< /Text>

You pay for the atmosphere. Upscale Mexican restaurant. Customer service was great! The waiter was honest about drinks and food. Didn't try to upset us. Most of the food is pretty decent/average. The drinks are good. The posole tasted like home on the holidays. All in all. Good date night spot! Great location for nearby walking after. Not-too-shabby.<//Review>

I actually forgot to take pictures of my food because of how excited I was when it arrived! I had the Classica Chicken (Tacos) which was amazing! Generous portion sizes as well. Two others in our party said the Fish Bola was great too.</text>

<text>Tremendous Mexican food in an exciting part of Midtown.  I was blown away by the quality of the enchiladas, and I had the opportunity to try three different styles.  The mole was exceptional, and the salsa roja were delicious too.  The chips are served hot with a side of tasty black beans and a refreshing green salsa.  I wanted a good craft beer, and they had none other than Revision on tap.  Service is not the focus here, but the food is completely worth it.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I have been a Zocalo fanatic for years. I often come here for special occasions with family, bring out of town friends here for a taste of Sacramento, and have enjoyed many wonderful date nights. I requested Zócalo delivery for my quarantine birthday and my sweet friend ordered it for me, and the quality was excellent.

The decor of this restaurant is really awe inspiring. They take such care and meaning into their interior design and each restaurant has different gorgeous details to explore. I’ve tried a handful of food and drinks off the menu and have loved everything they make.

The only negative I have to say is that we almost always have terrible service. I’ve had a feeling this is due to profiling, but I hope that’s not true. We get neglected for too long at the beginning, have too few check backs and don’t get offered refills, plate clearing, etc. This can be really frustrating but the amazing food and gorgeous atmosphere always bring us back.

We have made a complaint once before and the manager was generous enough to comp our whole bill and give us his business card to let him know when we’d be coming back so he could arrange great service.

This most recent visit, we (group of 2) called not far in advance and inquired if there was availability, since I know most places are requesting reservations (Mid June 2020). Emoni talked to me on the phone and was very friendly and helpful. She arranged for us to come in 45 mins. Since it was last minute, we sat on their street side patio. Emoni was so sweet and welcoming and led us to our table and made sure it was in the shade. It was a very hot day and it was very frustrating that we sat there for 15 minutes without being greeted. We went back to the host stand to let them know no one had come by. Then a girl who looked like a host came by to take our drink order, and we put in food as well. A few mins later a guy swung by with utensils but still no chips or water (like they normally do) and a full ten mins after we ordered, the food came. I frustratedly let the food runner know we still hadn’t even received our drinks and he was very apologetic. Our drinks arrived along with our food a minute later, a full 25 mins after sitting at our table. No one ever introduced themselves as our server. At that point we wanted to quickly enjoy our drinks and small bites and get out of there. The fish tacos on the happy hour menu were fantastic, as was the blackberry margarita, although I thought the marga would have been better with a salt rim than sugar.

Thank you Zocalo for providing such exquisite meals on a regular basis for me and my family. I’m sorry for the novel, but I hope the thorough review is helpful.</review><Rating>3</Rating>< GmapID>

One of the best Mexican Restaurant I have visited. I really liked the high ceiling, palm trees, flower arrangement at the entry. We were blown away by the looks. Then 8 of us, pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Food was extremely tasty. Service was simply great. We enjoyed the pitcher of Margarita suggested by waitress. We really enjoyed our meal here. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

The food and the service there was amazing. The environment was great and I loved the bar service. Drinks were really good. They have valet parking which is perfect for downtown. I took my daughter there for dinner. It is definitely my new favorite restaurant. 5 star all the way❤<//Text>

<review>Service is a little slow so don't go there if you're in a rush and acoustics cause the noise to be louder than expected but otherwise its beautiful,  great food, and large bar is great for mingling. Probably a great place for a date or Saturday night hangout spot.< /review>< user_name>

<review>Our reservation was at 7 and we were seated right away. It was my daughter's birthday and they were kind enough to put the cake I'd made her in their refrigerator. Their salsas were wonderful as were the fresh tortilla chips. It's a beautiful place, but it was extremely loud. Everyone but me loved their food. I'd ordered shrimp tacos but there was way too much pickled cabbage on them. They were okay after I removed the pile of cabbage. I also had one of their signature blackberry margaritas which was good but very strong, with a strong tequila taste. When they brought out the cake they'd put a sparkler on it. I'd definitely go again I'd just order something else.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>My preferred spot for Mexican food. I wish there were more places like this around Stockton. Service is typically above par. It has a good feel to it. Food is similar to a place in San Francisco I loved.
I highly recommend it! I never have a bad experience at Zocalo Midtown, 1801 Capitol Ave, Sacramento, CA 95811< /review>< Rating>

A very fancy location... The food is okay but nothing special. Service was severely lacking when my fiancé and I came for dinner. Took forever to get a menu, drinks, food, and the bill. I felt like we were sitting around for ages.

Probably won't come back. Disappointing.<//review>

<Text>Zocalo is my default Mexican restaurant when I want to fill my cravings at a higher tier place. Even early on in the week the restaurant will be busy, so if you don't want to sit at the bar call ahead. Personally I think they specialize in margaritas and haven't found one I don't enjoy, spicy or sweet. Their guacamole is fantastic and is a great addition to the chips and salsa you start with. The only complaint I have is that everything is a little more expensive from a price point, even for the tier & style of restaurant.</Text><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

<text>This restaurant is clean and has a friendly atmosphere. I am new to the Sacramento area and fell in love with this place. The portions are a good size and you can tell the quality of the ingredients are great. The service was fantastic as well. The waiter came frequently, but not to the point where it was annoying. He was very observant on our table and knew when to refill a glass.<//text>< pictures>

It’s packed full of flavor and good to eat with a dish or with the chips and salsa. I love the papas rolled tacos because I don’t eat meat. There are also other options for non meat eaters.

The food here is amazing.  The spice level of all the appetizers was spot on letting the flavor come through.  The waitstaff was attentive and efficient through our entire stay making this an amazing eat and an easy one.  On top of all this the price was more than fair for everything, especially near downtown Sacramento.  If there was one small downside I would say this place is loud.  That being said it was happy hour and it was packed because of all the people wanting delicious food.  There fortunately is ample outside seating if the noise level is too much for you.<//text>

Food was OK, service slow and overly inattentive (water never refilled, had to chase down the waiter for the bill, never checked on us once the food was delivered). Honestly, the burrito bowl down the street at Chipotle is better, but my husband liked the mole. Overall rating = meh.<//Text>

The food was amazing. I ordered tacos from the happy menu and my wife ordered the red enchiladas. Everything tasted fresh and full of flavor. The service was very friendly the entire time but 3 different servers helped us during our visit and none of them introduced themselves so it was confusing to know who can help us.< /review>

Rest of the food is good as well. I don't usually like rice at restaurants as it's bland, but the cilantro rice here is good. Drinks are good too. It's a bit pricier than other spots, but it's worth it.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Today was my 2nd time eating at Zocalo and I loved it both times! Both times it was very busy so it's best to plan ahead, get your name on a list and then wander around midtown. Fabulous cocktails, fun atmosphere , and excellent food! The staff are quick and courteous! Indoor seating is in a beautiful space and they have outdoor patio seating as well. Great for a quick date, large group, or solo at the bar! Highly recommend!</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809ad0db8e85f9d3:0x93970692f99a73a7<//gmap_id></record>

I enjoy the food here - it's of a high quality and it's unique. Nice area of outdoor seating for when the weather is good. Very long bar inside. Reasonable prices, especially for lunch. For some reason though it's not a place I feel like going to all the time.<//Text>< rating>

Great food and drinks. Good ambience and decorations. Could be loud inside but they have decent space at their patio. Great Pitchers of sangria. The Fish tacos and Enchiladas de Mole are really good. If you dont find parking around the valet is just right there for $8.< /text>

Zocalo never disappoints. Its upscale environment is always bustling and quick. Portions are large and presentation is good. Not only is food quality delicious, but the bar and margarita menus are full and unique.</Review>

The restaurant is beautiful the menu is super delicious. The bar has everything. The service at the bar is 100%. But if you are a party of 1 eating sit down lunch service is not always consistent. This place ain't cheap, so watch what you order it adds up quick  A party of 3 or 4 will probably get the best sit down experience here<//Text>

<review>Out of everything I liked about this restaurant, the thing that stood out the most was the staff. The manager came by and checked on us a few times and was very courteous to our parties gluten free needs. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive as well.

The black bean dip that comes with the chips is to die for! The coffee was an excellent roast as well.

All of our parties entrees were healthy sized portions and none of us were left wanting. Excellent quality food and service for a reasonable price left us all very happy. Will definitely be returning again.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeYzWH5c_IcCgs2BTPD0kvqkCB7ISkePt6RJHI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPcnId17LKWdtz06M4-405E5GwdJqC-56nK4Bp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809ad0db8e85f9d3:0x93970692f99a73a7<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
BEWARE!  FOOD POISONING!  Within one hour of eating there I started to have severe stomach cramps. Within 2 hours SEVERE diarrhea for approximately 8 hours.  My daughter also ate there and ended up throwing up in the middle of the night.  Also when they served their community dishes they had NO SERVING UTENSILS. We were a very large group of people in a private party. We had to use our fingers or used forks that we had been using from previous dishes.  I complained to staff about that and that they should provide serving spoons or forks and they just looked at me like 'whatever'.  They did not try to rectify it by providing serving utensils.  Not impressed, and then on top of it we got FOOD POISONING.  Highly suggest management review their serving and food safety policies.  This incident occurred at the very beginning of December 2018.<//Review>

I am guessing this is Mexican good with a twist,  but wow! The food was very tasty and the portions were of decent size. My wife and I ordered an appetizer and an entree, which were sufficient for us. I had 2 house margaritas and my wife a Paloma. Everything came up to less than $65, and for the quality I would say this will be a recurrent place for us.<//Review>

Very good happy hour, cheap prices and available on the weekends which is fantastic. Food as far as I can tell is great, but service can be a bit show sometimes (very popular place). Would definitely recommend for a weekend snack and drink!<//Text>

<time>1512701567735</time><rating>5< /rating><Review>I'd, easily, rate this place 4.5 stars - if I could, but that's not an option. Seeing as I had an amazing experience, I decided to give a 5-star rating. I'd go back, at least, 2 more time hahaha. The food I had was 4 stars, but the restaurant is beautiful and so is the customer service from the staff. For the latter attributes, I'd give them a 5-star rating, if not more. Our waiter was outstanding, the hostess was sweet, and the seating options are great. There is outdoor seating, and he interior looks like a place you'd want to take someone you want to propose to - if you'd propose in a nice restaurant. I loved sitting outside while eating, but would have enjoyed admiring the surroundings while having a conversation with good people. I highly recommend this place, and feel you'd miss out if you don't try them. The prices are VERY fair.<//Review>< Pictures>

There was a strange sewage smell in the middle of the bar. Went for my birthday and in spite of the smell, the place was packed and lively. It was easily one of the best places to hang out on Cinco De Mayo, with attractive people and outdoor eating and drinking available.</review>

<Review>Food was okay. Server pretty much ignored us. The hostess and busser took care of most of our needs. He got my friend's order wrong and when the food runner/ busser took it back, the server came out and told my friend he ordered the wrong thing. He didn't. The server just put it in wrong.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We visited for the first time based on a recommendation. We were thoroughly impressed by the service and delicious menu. The decor is beautiful too. For the appetizer we ordered the empanadas. And for dinner we ordered the fish and asada tacos. The meal arrived at the table the same time as the appetizer! Great fast service. Everything was fresh and delicious! I would highly recommend it. As a special treat the manager came by and brought us a free piece of their made from scratch Tres Leches cake with fresh berries on top. This was the perfect way to end a great meal. Thanks Zocalo. We enjoyed our visit. (Almost forgot, they provide chips, salsa and beans- also delicious)</Review>

<Review>Zocalo deserves 10 stars.  Some of the most delicious food in Sacramento and outstanding customer service.  Our dinner party was served family style in the Morelo Room in late October.  Appetizers, food, drinks, and desserts are from a fixed menu chosen when you reserve the room. Very festive and fun.  And huge portions.  Beautiful restaurant. We're already planning another trip to have brunch.</Review>< date>

We had an enjoyable experience.  We had a party of 20, we were able to order from the regular menu. Everyone's food came out the right temp. Only a few minor sides missing but they came out quickly.

It is loud in the restaurant.< /text>

Food was excellent. Had some enchiladas with a mole that was just perfect. I cleaned the plate in a way that would have made my mother proud. The only minus was the time it took to get everyone's dinner to the table. Big gap between the first set and last plate to arrive. Same with the cocktails. Otherwise I recommend.<//text>

When I hear the name of this place I dread the $$ that i might spend. Happy hour was where it's at with just enough food to fill and chips and dip to help. Their sangria was the star of the show. 2 drinks+ happy hour food came in at roughly $25.</review>

One of my favorite midtown restaurants... I love their cilantro rice... This is always such a great place to come to either with a large group or with just a dinner companion... The service is what always stands out... I like things very plain so I order exactly what I want a la carte and they always smile and are happy to accommodate me which is really quite wonderful especially when you don't or can't eat a lot of things... Also each and every service staff seems to make an effort to make the visit enjoyable... One of management came by to bring us a glass of sangria just for the heck of it... It's the little touches like that that make the difference in a dining experience... The food is wonderful and the presentation is very creative and beautiful as is interior design and ambiance and location :-)</Review>

<Review>It wasn't the best I've ever had. Pretty decent. Sat oitside; was pretty warm with the heaters. The order completely forgot my order. He brought everyone else their meal but mine. Said mine was coming. Waited 35 minutes. Everyone finished their meals. I left with out my meal ever being served to me. Ate about half of my son's food & a few fork fulls of my Fiances. Pretty disappointing.</Review>< UserId.>

One of my favorite midtown restaurants... I love their cilantro rice... This is always such a great place to come to either with a large group or with just a dinner companion... The service is what always stands out... I like things very plain so I order exactly what I want a la carte and they always smile and are happy to accommodate me which is really quite wonderful especially when you don't or can't eat a lot of things... Also each and every service staff seems to make an effort to make the visit enjoyable... One of management came by to bring us a glass of sangria just for the heck of it... It's the little touches like that that make the difference in a dining experience... The food is wonderful and the presentation is very creative and beautiful as is interior design and ambiance and location :-)<//text>

Zocalo deserves 10 stars.  Some of the most delicious food in Sacramento and outstanding customer service.  Our dinner party was served family style in the Morelo Room in late October.  Appetizers, food, drinks, and desserts are from a fixed menu chosen when you reserve the room. Very festive and fun.  And huge portions.  Beautiful restaurant. We're already planning another trip to have brunch.</text>

I'm usually not drawn to fancy Mexican food restaurants but this one is different. It's got a unique feel and design you don't see anywhere else. They also have a great happy hour that is even available on Sundays!</review>

Came here for Cinco de Mayo. It was packed. I was happy they had tacos and burritos that you could buy without being seated at an actual table. They had a side bar that was great too. Tacos were good too!</Review>

The freshness of the food has declined, the cilantro was browning and worst of all the fish civiche was not fresh and got me sick.

We recently hosted a baby shower for my sister in law at this location.  Everything from the service, to the decor of the room, to the food and promptness and friendliness of the wait staff was beyond excellent!!! I was so impressed with how well they handled our big group. I would definitely choose this location again to host another party</Review>

First off, the place looks spectacular.  However, when I pay 20 bucks for a burrito I expect to have something better than a half cup of asada and canned beans in it. And for the love of God cilantro is a spice, not a garnish!< /Text>

One of the best Mexican restaurants in downtown. It's beautifully decorated and they have awesome drinks. But the wait lines here are crazy if you don't make reservations.

I love this place for big gatherings.<//Text>

<Text>Happy Hour was maybe a dollar off some items. Not near enough staff. Bean dip and salsa wasn't to bad. Couldn't hear the person across from me with out yelling. Nothing more then an upscale expensive bar, not really a restaurant.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely outstanding service, absolutely outstanding food..period...Wow!!!!Jose the shift lead was totally on top of everything having to do with our dining expeirence. Give that guy a raise owners!!!! It's our new fav, period end of story!!

Ok back again.
We made reservations for a party of 5, and requested a specific table. We arrived and quickly parked by the valet staff.  We walked inside and were quickly greeted by the hostess.  We were seated at the table we had requested.  Our server came to our table quickly and introduced herself and took our drink orders.

Jose Lastra the shift lead came to our table and asked if everything was going well, then continued on checking on other guests tables.  The timing of our appetizers and our main dishes was flawless. The quality of all the of our food was excellent in the least.  Order anything and everything at will!! Everything we have ever ordered has been consistantly delicious!

Again, Jose Lastra stopped by a couple times during our dinner to check in on us, this guy know how to make guests feel like king's and queens.  His professional touch makes your visit feel like a personal experience.  We travel and eat out in a lot of places, in my opinion this guy exemplifies what it is to take care of customers and keep them coming back.  The treatment we have received at Zocalos is easily the best we have had in NorCal.  If I owned a restaurant I would want this guy working for me.

As a whole I can't say enough about this place. From beginning to end it's  been flawless.<//Text>

<text>I am very disappointed with this restaurant. In May, I graduated and decided to spend my graduation dinner here. I had about 15 of my family members show up in support of my accomplishment and 7 out of the 15 ended up with food poisoning. I understand things happen however when I called to notify the restaurant, I asked to speak with a manager. His name is Nicholas. Very good conversation and very apologetic.. He told me he would refund my mom's account based on how many of us got sick. My mother spent close to 1000 on this restaurant. She paid for everyone's food and nothing was refunded back into her account as promised. Nicholas also informed me that if it wasn't refunded to just go ahead and call back and ask for him. I called back several days later, and several days after that and kept being told that Nicholas wasn't in. A lady told me he would be back at 4, so I called at 4 and was told yet again Nicholas wouldn't be back until 6.< /text>< pictures>

Went here for the second time, and I've been dissatisfied twice. The place is large and loud, to the point of not being able to have a simple conversation with the people across from you. The food is ok. The service is ok. I consider it vastly overpriced, especially considering the fact that they stated us at plastic fold-up tables.</text>

This place is a must. You know it is good cause always booming busy! My husband and I love to eat 2 to 4 appetizers as our meal. I recommend the quesadilla and ceviche verde! And there is also a a waiter who is our favorite Ricardo!! Parking is a challenge but they have valet parking for $8.</Text>

<review>I loved this place the first time. Then I went back a second time, wasn't what I thought. I wanted to be seated outside and eat a bit and drink good coffee. Once seated, was forgotten about.  I went to leave, a guy talked to me, maitre d or manager, offer to make everything right. He did and it was nice. But still left a bad after effect.
I would still recommend it but, don't site outside of waiters View?</review>< Pictures>

<Text>So it's not exactly the cheapest Mexican food you can find, but its a great place to go other than some Mexican Dive or hole in the wall restaurant.  It's more upscale, the flavors are great, and the desserts are even greater!

I've been here once, had great food and great company, so I'm definitely planning on giving this place a try again.  In fact, it's on my calendar for this weekend.  Once I try some more tasty entrees, you can expect an update.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><user>113952563499830631249</user></record></dataset><record>

You know, it doesn't matter what you have here. I've had multiple food items here and have never been disappointed. The black berry margaritas are the best I've ever had. Today our server's name was Maysa and 1 word, Amazing!!! Eric the manager has been here forever and always makes sure our experiences are great. We thank the entire staff for what they do.</text>

< review>
Love my zocalos!
.
Love their cilantro green rice . Literally that's everything. I love how the rice has so much flavor and goes with everything.
.
I love coming here for their chef dinner. The monthly chef dinner is every first Monday of the month. I love how the menu is different each month and surprise menu for each menu.
.
Each chef monthly dinner comes with a welcome on the house appetizers, a appetizer from the set menu, entree, and dessert. Each course comes with cocktail, beer, or wine. And 30 per person.
.
I love how each month have their themes and we as a big group would all dress accordingly and have lots of fun.
.
Parking is easy because there are plenty of street parking, and next block over on 17th street is only 2 dollar parking.
.
Overall if you haven't been to zocalos try their tortilla which is a must because its home made and its sweet. As well their cilantro rice which is green and so yummy.  They serve brunch and happy hour which is great for certain days. Definitely a great place for dinner because of the vibe and great brunch on Sunday because of the lovely patio. Anyways thanks for reading where do you like to brunch at?<//review>

I love this place. One of my top dinner choices in Midtown Sac. Margaritas are bomb, servers are always cracking me up, and the fish tacos are amazing. Can sometimes get a bit noisy inside, but the patio outside it great for a more intimate feel.</Text>

<text>The service was PERFECT. Very attentive to the point where our drinks would never run out or if we needed something, they were always close enough to ask. This place has ample seating, especially outside. The atmosphere was both calm and inviting, and would make a great place to visit on a night out on the town.

The food was alright and were of a decent portion. Not sure if things would've been slightly different if we visited on a Saturday night.  They also need to keep an eye on their restrooms.< /text>< userid>

<Text>Everything here was top of the line. The service was very attentive. The sangria was fresh with excellent flavor, but wasn't weak. The ceviche seemed like it was fresh from the ocean and the three taco plate gives you a little bit of everything. And, it's all reasonably priced. High praise deserved! I'll definitely be back.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Happy Cinco De Mayo. I make sure there is no where else that can transform up for Cinco De Mayo like Zocolos- midtown. The food was incredible as usual, however the Carnitas was like no various other. The blend of savory meals gone along with all the tasty blends of benefits that selected the mixed drinks. The mariachis were top notch. A charming dinner as well as celebration ambience that all the guest seemed to delight in.< /review>

The place is nice and upscale, seats in and outside. I'd take a date here (not a first one, though). The food is pretty darn good, tried the fish tacos and carnitas plate. The portions aren't necessarily a lot, but it'll fill you up. Got an appetizer on the house after being seated, which was nice...not sure if they thought I was someone. Meals average to $14-18. The staff seems to be a hit or miss. The first time, I sat outside dressed very casually and we never got refills on dips, one refill with water and checked on once (I'm fine with that). The second time I dressed nice and sat inside, as soon as my water got half way, dip/rice/beans ran out they would ask if I wanted a refill. So unsure if you're appearance or seating influence service, maybe just the waiter< /review>

<Text>It wasn't bad. The service was okay. I do NOT recommend the French toast. It taste like toasted bread despite it's great description. The queso fundido has good flavor and the enchiladas de huevo are good. The fresh chips with black bean dip and salsa was great as well.</Text><Time>1557092995337< /Time><user>105509052944110269152</user>< resp>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Spouse took me here for Mom's Day breakfast and it was so delicious! Did the Asada breakfast as well as had a delicious house margarita. What better way to begin your morning a 9am lol. Husband had the chilacliasa as well as truly appreciated them. The dips for the chips were delicious and also fresh. We additionally went with the guacamole which was so gooooooodddddd. Staff was super pleasant, all smiles, and also took a photo with their video camera and published a picture of our family members in front of the fountain. Oh yep, that was an additional component I really enjoyed! All the plants in the dining establishment were all fresh. Not something you see a lot of anymore. Attractive as well as bright. Such a good experience.< /Review></record>

I know it was Saturday night and it was super busy but it took forever to get a table.
Service was great, food very good, noise level extremely high, not easy to have a conversation with someone two feet away.
Was very festive atmosphere but loud and too cold to take a table outside.< /text>

We had reservations for 1:15pm. We got there 10 min early but table wasn't ready. It was suggested that we get a drink at the bar. We had to ask about our table twice and then sat there an hour before our meal came and had to ask about that too. Food was beautiful, hot, and delicious.  Service was really poor. Probably won't go back as we all had headaches when we left from the loud music and the need to yell to have others at our table hear us.< /review>

You got about 1/5 chance of actually getting what you order, expect a 10min wait for a small glass of water, with no ice. And, 0 luck of getting alcohol. Horrible management, i feel bad for the server. Hard to even know how much is the servers fault, seeing how they should not be serving food that is incorrect. Just horrible experience. Will not be returning, ever again.</Review>

Food is excellent,  presentation is excellent, experienced wait staff and support is excellent.
Parking is atrocious but there is valet service. Neighborhood for the most part is clean and safe (except for the low rent housing across the street that has iron fencing... to keep the natives in)
Avoid parking on that side of the street. Or you might be confronted by one of the residents of the low rent housing since I think they believe they own that side of the street.
Good News Dog Lovers! Outdoor seating and space allows for your best friend to dine with you!
There's a most excellent craft brewery next door that, if your a beer lover, should try!< /Review>

<Text>The ambience is nice but the food is underwhelming. The carnitas sounded delicious by the description, but completely lacked flavor. It's just overpriced Mexican food and I would rather eat at the food trucks near my work. The cocktails are good, so I would come back here for drinks.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This is no taqueria, this is a restaurant with delicious fair in a hip, stunning setting. It's one of the most beautiful restaurants in NorCal. Come for the food, stay for the trendy pretty people....but bring the wallet.</text>

Aesthetically, one of the most beautiful restaurants in Sacramento. Can be a bit pricey especially if you are enjoying some of their margaritas. The arrachera is still my favorite dish eventhough they have tweeked their recepie over the years. Definitely a big enough dish to share if you're into that sort of thing. Sevice is consistently good. Overall, still one of the top restaurant experiences in Sacramento.< /Text>

There are better Mexican joints around. A favorite is Azuls, very authentic and savory.  Zocalos....Disappointed with the shrimp tacos that’s had pickled cabbage on them. First they were mini tacos and the vinegar in the  cabbage was so strong, like pure vinegar I couldn’t even finish them. I love pickled foods, but it really isn’t a mix for shrimp for this dish, or my palate. Now the Carnitas and rice plate was delicious. If I ever go back I would order  this. Now.... the inside of this establishment is so damn noisy, you have to be part deaf,  or will be if you hang in there too long. Couldn’t wait to walk through it ( this applied to my millennial family who can tolerate noise) to get to the outdoor seating.  Not sure I will ever go back to this establishment but I said that before on a few distant visits. There are just much better places in the same vicinity. But I say hey try it if you are so inclined.</Text>

Incredibly loud.  They probably won't address the issue until enough customers complain. Best to sit outside or back room that has a lower ceiling.</Review>

Zocalo Roseville is one of my favorite restaurants in the Sacramento area. Zocalo Midtown is nowhere close. I've been there twice and I was severely disappointed both times. The staff are slow and impolite and the food is never as good as the food in Roseville. I gave them three stars because of the location and the food that's good, but not great like the food in Roseville.< /text>

I enjoyed it but for 2 of us we spent $80.00 before tip. I thought that was pretty pricey for mexican food. I probably won't go back, because of the price.< /Text>

Food was great, but the table was so high I felt like I needed a booster seat!  Also had a server drop a drink next to me. Got glass shards in my open shoes and was not even asked if I was ok, even when he saw me cleaning glass out of my shoe and foot.<//Text>

The food wasn't that great for Mexican food. Definitely forgettable and did not leave me craving to come back. The service was good and waiters were very present during the meal. The food was just lacking in flavor and being special especially for the area in downtown Sac it is in.</Text>

<review>I have visited both the Roseville location and the Zocalo Midtown location,  and initially thought that Zocalo Midtown was the best. After my last visit on October 19, 2018 I am beginning to question that. My family and I drove from Reno to the Zocalo Midtown which is over two hours away only to receive terrible service. I had told my mother who was visiting from Las Vegas how amazing this place was, but after visiting I was embarrassed to have driven all the way out there for nothing. When we were sat we were greeted by a very lovely server who was super pleasant but even her great attitude could not make up for the poor service the host and bartender provided us with. The host walked by our table and asked my mother if she needed water or any additional chips and salsa while we waited for our food, which she said yes to. He never did bring these things to our table though. He walked back and forth near our table about five times but never actually  brought any of the things that he offered. We sat there and waited for things because our server was busy with lots of other tables. We had not made a big deal out of this but then a table with three gentlemen was sat right behind us. The host who appeared to know them ran over to their table and shrieked in excitement to see his friends, gave them all hugs, and took their alcohol order. It wasn't even a minute after they had ordered when he was back with their drinks. Shortly afterwards two more gentlemen joined the party of three and the same thing happened. This time the bartender who appeared to also know them, walked over their drinks immediately and gave them hugs and asked how he could make their visit even better. Meanwhile, my family and I sat there waiting over 5 minutes to get our drinks or to have anyone approach us to see if we needed anything extra. This was an awful experience and it is not okay to provide such blatant and awful service to customers who are not your friends!!!</review>< username>

Go for drinks NOT for food!  All our entrees were delivered to the table cold. Returned to kitchen and came back luke warm with no flavor. If this was the first time, I would excuse it, but it’s the third. I’m improving my odds by going to another restaurant.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I'm from a small town down south in a Mnterey County , we were visiting the area for a wine expo in Sacramento and after long hours of exploring the expo we decided to go get some food, so we asked locals for their recommend place to eat. Zocalo was the first name that came up on 3 sac residents. So we tried it out and let me tell you all, this place is perfect! Great welcoming staff, manager was on top of every detail in the restaurant floor on such a busy day and the waiters were the most polite employees I've seen in any restaurant. Definetly recommend this place. Inexpensive and awesome service as well as the food.< /review>< userid>

Even with reservations, parties are often seated 20 minutes late. Waiting at the bar is often not feasible because it's packed with other people who also had reservations and haven't been seated. Waiters disappear for long stretches of time without offering new drinks or even to refill water. Not sure what management's game plan is, but it's not working.< /Text>< Pics>

I arrived with my friend around 5:00pm. Parking is a bit tough but not impossible. It wasn't super busy yet but happy hour only lasts until 6pm.
We each got a blackberry margarita, chips & guacomole, he got a quesadilla and I got the happy hour civiche (because the spicy one apparently was not - why? I don't know). Food was delicious! But a bit pricey even for happy hour.
Low key upset that they took our chips before I could finish my guacamole. I was done with my ceviche but not the chips & guac 😪<//Text>

Reservation for 13 on Saturday waited over thirty minutes to be seated after arriving five minutes early and over one and half hours for food after ordering, brought one guest the wrong order three times.  Won't be going back!< /Text>

Bottom line:
Got seated immediately
Outside seating atmosphere was great
Server was comfortable with complex order
Food was very good, came quickly, nice combination of flavors, didn't feel bloated after meal
Kitchen gave us a complimentary dessert (ice cream w/fresh churro)< /Review>

<text>Zocalos in Midtown is it really fantastically beautiful restaurant my understanding is that it used to be a Cadillac dealership in it's early life. I had Los americana's plate. Essentially to Polo hard tacos complete with refried beans and cilantro green rice. It was a nice lunch under $20 with an iced tea. I highly recommend attending on Cinco de Mayo at least once in your life it's a festive fun event with lots of fun people and thirst quenching libations. Mojito's and margaritas are on point and I highly recommend trying their guacamole it to is also very good.< /text><UserId.>115766165370358046632< /UserId.></record>

<Text>My experience at Zocalo was ruined by Matt the bartender.  Things seemed to be perfectly acceptable; the "Crafted Margarita" was just okay.  Sadly the limes had been cut a day or two earlier and were dried out and a bit hideous. The chicken tacos were pretty good.
Anyway, back to Matt the bartender with a bit of an attitude.  When asked about wine, Matts response was "This is not a wine bar..."<//Text>< gmapID>

I’ve been here a few times for dinner and brunch over the years.  Never had necessarily an experience that made me crave coming back.  Stopped in to meet some friends and didn’t know what to order.  Our server Rachelle (?) helped pick out some menu items that actually make me want to come back for more!  We ended up ordering based on her menu knowledge.  My flautas were sooooo good...crispy, fresh and the chicken tinga was flavored spot on.  My bff ended up getting a burrito that was delish.  I had never had the Guacamole...but Rachelle recommended we try it.  It’s fresh and delicious!!

If you don’t know what to order, let your server know what your tastes are.  They can help point you in the right direction.

Great service and food!  Can’t wait to come back for brunch.  Thanks Rachelle!< /Text>

Went for dinner on Friday at 5:30. It was kind of busy. Had a party of 7. Hostess ws very rude and did not attempt to accommodate us. She said she could find us a table but we had to leave by 6:30 as it was reserved for another party. Did not asked if we didn't mind waiting. I asked of we shold go somewhere else and did not get a response. Just walked away. Never going back !!!!!!< /text>

<Text>Food is ok.  It could use more seasoning and that’s a personal opinion . During busy times it is almost impossible to hold a conversation unless you lean into the persons next to you and speak loudly .  The restaurant most likely appeals to a younger crowd.<//Text>< Pics>

This place is live, with a fun, drinking crowd. The food is really good also. The only drawback, if it is one, is that it's a large room with high ceiling, which makes for a very loud environment. This is not the place for a conversation focused gathering.<//Text>

3 highlights about this place below.

Came from the East Bay to visit a friend in sac town, and we ate here. Despite my perception of the capital as being an area desolate of good restaurants when compared to SF/Oak, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I think this is one of the best Mexican(?) restaurants I've been to. Why?

1. Ambiance - elegant but unpretentious. I feel you could come here for a nice dress-up dinner date but also just to grub with the guys. Has an ancient Hanging Gardens of Babylon type of feel - high ceilings, indoor greenery, spacious tables and comfy seats.

2. Food - Was impressed from the get-go - the complimentary tortilla chips and bean/mole dip was so good. We had like 5 refills. The tortillas were something amazing and took all their dishes (including my fish tacos) to the next level.  Not your plain ol' tortilla, but had a good thickness and chew/softness to it. We had the ceviche, guacamole, quesadilla for starters and everything was great. I got the fish tacos and my friends got the skirt steak and featured special plate - the dishes were flavorful but not overdone.

3. Portion per $ - this place ain't cheap and the nice ambiance had me scared this would be one of those fancy places where a $17 taco dish would come with one dinky taco. But I was wrong. 3 hefty tacos plus rice and beans on the side was more than filling and totally worth the price. In fact, our group of 5 hungry dudes had leftovers even though one of us didn't order a main dish (we did have 3 appetizers we shared though).

Legit.<//text>

One of the best Mexican restaurants in midtown (and Roseville), let alone one of the best restaurants period. Beautiful, light and airy, vibrant and the food is superb. Try the empanadas, and of course the carnitas, but everything here is great. The staff are super friendly and happy hour is especially good value. Kids get ice cream and a churro at the end of the meal.</Text>

Overpriced for the food quality. It's a "Hip" place for people who don't know better, or would rather go to a "Safe" option.  It has become a soulless machine that feels like a chain restaurant. They are resting on their laurels.< /Review>

My husband and I went here for lunch today for our 2nd wedding anniversary. The food was really great and everything came out really fast. I got the el burrito with the carnitas, it was HUGE! The only complaint is that our server was not as attentive as I was hoping.<//Text>

Just wanted to HIGHLY recommend Zocalos as one of the top kid friendly restaurants to visit in town. I hadn't realized that going with kids in tow was an option given that the location feels elegant, but was AMAZED by how they nailed it on being pro family. This is a great place to teach little ones restaurant manners.  Here is a summary of everything that Zocalos did tonight to make it a great dining experience for the kids:
1) rearranged their seating plan so that we could have a booth,
2) awesome happy hour menu 7 days per week ($5 margaritas y'all and $5 tacos),
3) super kids menu and reasonably priced,
4) brought the kids juice in cool take home cups (no charge for the drinks or cups),
5) brought the kids churros and ice cream (no charge),
6) the waiters went out of their way to be fast and accommodating, and
7) two of the managers were the ones that kept checking on us and bringing the kids juice and churros,
8) fun coloring and crayons.
They really nailed it. I asked if we got some kind of special treatment or if they go out of their way like this for all families. The manager has a 9 month old and was just so totally into kids and welcoming and yes he confirmed that this is how they host families. Also, the other patrons around us were all happy to see the kids at the restaurant too. The noise level is high enough too that it would be hard for anyone to hear if the kids get loud. This restaurant gets a 10+!<//Text>

Loved the Molé Enchiladas with a chocolate type flavored sauce, YES. Rice and beans of course. The Guac there, wow, so yummy. Had a Blackberry Margarita, it was strong, but I usually dont drink so it lasted me through the whole dinner, but it was sweet and tasted good.
The servers are very helpful and friendly and do a great job. Little loud acoustics, but thats just how this building is built I believe. Its social, trendy, and fun. Full bar as well if you arent looking to sit down at a table. I highly recommend.< /Review>

<text>I love good Mexican (or pseudo Mexican) restaurants.  I have two criteria for judging  Mexican restaurants:  (1) Do thay make a respectable margarita, and (2) how is their chili relleno?

Zocalo's margarita is respectable; a sold B+.  The chili relleno...meh.  It was tasty, but nothing like a traditional relleno.  It was fully stuffed with delicious slow-cooked pork, cheese and other goodness.  That part was outstanding.  However, it was coated with what looked and tasted like corn meal mixed with chili powder, and then deep fried.  Not a fan of that approach.  The result was a thin, brittle, and slightly burnt-tasting coating that did not adhere to the chili at all. Think deep-fried enchilada, but with a chile pepper instead of a tortilla.  My grade for the relleno: C-.  The meat inside was dee-lish-us!

The service was good (B+), although I found it funny that the server pointed out a dish that is "unique" to Zocalo: Cochinita Pibil.  NOT unique at all.  I've eaten at two other Mexican restaurants this week, and both had cochinita pibil on the menu. It's a great dish, and I may order it the next time I am there. Based on the tastiness of the filling in the relleno, I would bet a margarita that it is very good.

In sum: I will definitely be going back.  A good margarita is hard to come by, and there is much more to explore on the menu.</text><Rating>3</Rating>< Pictures>

Noisy but good food and service. Check out the little window above the bar. There is an office for another business above the bar and they can check in to see whether it is busy or not. Then come down for dinner and drinks.< /text>

The best Mexican food, not to many choices, but very good.
Food comes out very, very fast, not a lot of time for conversation.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It's weird because everyitme I passed by here I thought it was a bar, (and truth be told it kinda has a bar vibe too)

The Chips dipping sauces are really fire, that shocked me 😂
And the staff is really chill!

It was really weird because every time I passed by I thought it was a bar (and the truth is that it also has a bar atmosphere)

Chips dipping sauces are really fire, that surprised me 😂
And the staff is really laid back!

En verdad  Fue raro porque cada vez que pasaba por aquí pensaba que era un bar (y la verdad es que también tiene un ambiente de bar)

Las salsas para mojar Chips son realmente fuego, eso me sorprendió 😂
¡Y el personal es realmente relajado!</Review>

(Translated by Google) It's a classic in Sacramento. Plentiful dishes, very elaborate. Very ambitious, maybe too much and everything.

(Translated by Google) Atypical place with a good spirit. Role plays the sir in the back room. All kinds of dishes and an improbable "Marseille" pancake with strawberries, bananas, maple syrup and everything that goes to the door of the cuisto. Very nice and cheap. The dishes are hearty

Lieu atypique avec un esprit bon enfant. Des jeux de rôles le sir dans l'arrière salle. Des plats de toute sorte et une improbable crêpe "Marseille" avec des fraises, des bananes, du sirop d'érable et tout ce qui passe a la porte du cuisto. Très sympa et pas cher. Les plats sont copieux<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The room is small, but the decor is tasteful and pleasant. The only downside is the old sheets. The hotel has a very nice balcony where you can eat. I really enjoyed eating breakfast on the balcony overlooking the central square.

房间小，但装修的很有品位而且怡人。唯一不足的是旧床单。 旅店有个特别漂亮的阳台，在那里可以就餐。我很喜欢在阳台吃着早餐俯瞰中央广场。< /Review>
