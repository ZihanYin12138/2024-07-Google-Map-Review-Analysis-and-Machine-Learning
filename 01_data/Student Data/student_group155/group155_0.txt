<text>I have been a happy satisfied customer of Tax Care in Concord for many years. I used to dread the hassle of filing my taxes yearly. Since I have been with Tax Care,  I look forward to seeing the staff each year, Everyone is cheery and knowledgeable. Even filing this year with Covid was effortless. I give them my highest rating,

< Review>
I called yesterday and scheduled an in person appointment today with Alondra.  I was pleasantly surprised of the ease of doing this as I experienced issues with other tax places.  She was professional and easy to do business.  I feel like we’re friends now.  The whole process was gratifying and will will definitely be returning !< /Review>

Tax Care Has been preparing my taxes for over 20 years now. They are the most professional tax preparers I have ever seen! They are professional, they are accountants, they are friends! In summary they are amazing!  I refer all my friends family and clients to them and everyone has great things to say about them! If you’re not using them you’re cheating yourself!!! Once you try them you will never try anyone else trust me : ) I use Fahim Courdey, he’s the best!!!</Text>

Year after year, since 2012, Tanvir has been doing our taxes. Never any problems, always on time, always correct. As long as we are in Brentwood or anywhere near, Tax Care will be our tax agent.<//Review>

I’ve always had nothing but the best service here. They are extremely efficient and the price is very reasonable. Once they had my information from the previous year, I was in and out of there in about 15 minutes. I would say they are exceptional!</Text>

Great place to do you taxes. Since I have found them haven’t gone to a different person, given I live in east coast these days. They will do whatever is legally possible to get you what you deserve. Shoutout to Fahim Chodahary and his staff...</text>

He and his crew are extremely professional. When I first found him he  helped me go back a few years and re do tax reports because they had been prepared incorrectly.
This guy and his business is awesome I highly recommend

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>What a disappointment. Referred to Tanvir Choudhary to do my business taxes. Had a great discussion and was pleased with our appointment. Spent an hour going over tax questions and issues. Unfortunately three weeks went by without any communication. Called the office and left a message for status. No responses until the fifth week and it was an associate who called me to ask me the same questions I had gone over with Tanvir. I was looking for an outfit a bit more professional and responsive. I was disappointed to the lack of response and apology for the inefficient unprofessional service.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Fahim and his staff are the greatest!!  Fahim has helped me with my taxes for over 10 years now.  He is such a nice guy.  He really helped me out this year when my fathers company was in a bind and had things needing to be done to get the business on right path again..  during the peak of tax season, he made it happen.   Thanks so much to you and your staff!!  You are the BEST< /text>

<Text>Watch out/over priced.I would not recommend them. I did my taxes, using Turbo Tax CD as I have done it many years in the past . This year  due to the new tax law and change in my income i decided to have a tax professional to review it.I read some reviews on line and I went to Tax care. I spoke with Timothy. I explained to him what I needed him to do.He stated that they charge a $45.00 consultation fee.So I down loaded my tax on to travel drive and went back to the office. He copied my information to his computer.Then he asked for some documents which I did not have. So on the next visit I  had everything he requested.Then The $45.00 changed to $399.00. So I questioned it. He stated in order for him to save us some money that would be the charge. I told him your competitions charge $150.00 to $200.00 to do the 1040 tax form. why do you charge $400.00? He mumbled and said that is the price.Then I asked if the amount of the saving was substantial. He said a least $1000 which he was to take $400.00??? . I said l need to get second opinion.Then he went on to tell me he had to charge me $45.00 consulting fee anyway. I said for what? what is the word consulting mean?Given recommendation not just Copying my information into your computer? Any way they charged me $45.00 for nothing . He was to speak to the owner and have him to call me But it has not happened yet and I do not thing it is going to happen.
In Regard to the owner's response I like to know if he can explain what consultation is ?Did Timothy give any pro/ con advise on my taxes? He copied my file to his computer.is that considered consultation.??</Text></record>

I have used Tax Care for over 20 years now! That are extremely professional, knowledgeable, and have great experience in tax planning and solutions for individual and small business planning and taxes. They are highly competent and ethical, and I have always got the best return possible based on my individual and business circumstances.

We have been going to Tax Care for a few years now and would not go any where else.  We trust them completely.  When we have a question or don't understand something, that take the time to break it down.  Best care for your taxes and tax concerns!< /text>

Was very upset I referred a friend they refused to give me the 50 deduction as advertised stating he came in with me. Very expensive for fikfill single and the was misled about the Rapid refund was not told it was a loan when infact it is and you have to make a certain amount not happy 😡won't go there again<//Text>

However, showed up at 4:15 and the doors were locked and lights were out. Also tried calling 3 times, no answer. But also no statement of hours of operation on voicemail message.

Otherwise this is usually the place i come to for livescans, and have always had a pleasant and quick experience there.

I was audited by IRS 2years in a row and they said that I owed them 110,000.00 thousandsh dollars  I took the paperwork to my tax preparer who tried but couldn't change anything. I was only making less than 80,000
a year .
I was referred to Tax care  who fought for me
and I ended up paying only 1500
Thank Tax care< /Text>

Best place for a natural looking spray tan that will last at least a week! The location is super cute and always very clean. I usually see Megan for my once a week tan and she is absolutely the best. She never misses a spot and my tan always turns out flawless. I’ve had tons of compliments on my tan and not one person has ever guessed it’s a spray tan! Go get sprayed by Megan, you won’t regret it!</text>

Morgan did great job listening to what I wanted in terms of color and overall needs. Blush tan is a good product and if you follow the guidelines you get the longevity and look. Thanks Morgan. I will be back for sure!<//Review>

<Review>I loved my BlushTan experience! Megan was the best. We worked together to figure out how deep of a shade I wanted to go and which kind of tan was best for me. I am a spray tan fanatic, I’ve done them all from mystic to DIY at home and this was BY FAR the best I’ve ever had. No streaks and no orange fingers 🥴 Thank you for making me feel so beautiful on my special day 🥰</Review>< rating>

That was 3 days ago, and I’m still so happy I did. It was my first time and Morgan was my attendant. I told her I’ve been using self-tanner at home for years. She politely explained that most people never go back to the mitt after experiencing BlushTan, and she wasn’t kidding. If you follow their pre-tan instructions (exfoliate, shave, no makeup etc) the color and longevity of this tan will exceed your expectations. The staff is genuinely kind and helpful, and Morgan’s attention to detail and contouring skills were outstanding. My husband said, “Wow, it looks like real sun.” 🙂 Totally worth the price for the quality— do it!!</review>< pics>

I had the best experience seeing Becky for a custom spray tan at the La Jolla location. She was so kind and let me ask a million questions as I was a newbie, she explained the process so well and made me feel super comfortable. Not to mention my tan turned out flawless and very natural looking. Would 100% recommend seeing her and I will for sure be back!!</Review>

I have now been to Sara at Blushtan 3 times for the spray tan. I have received countless spray tans all over as well as used endless self tanning products. I have never received incredible results like this before! Not only is blush tan and organic and safe product which is very important to me, but I have been blown away with the results! The color is incredible, my skin is not dry, itchy, flaky or uneven as other self tan or spray tan products, and I have never had something last over seven days and fade gradually as if it was a real tan with no lines no demarcations and no spots! Thank you Sara!!<//review>

Since it was my first time Ali walked me through the entire process and how to prolong my tan to get the most out of it.

Absolutely LOVED my tan from BlushTan! Natalie was very professional and super helpful walking me through all the post-care to make sure my tan was beautiful for as long as possible! I love that their solution is organic and the aesthetic of their studio is beautiful. I attached a picture of me on a boat for my friends birthday, and the reason for my tan! Overall, a wonderful experience.< /Text>

<text>So so so happy that I found BlushTan!! I’ve tried out a few tanning salons before, but this is by far the best spray tan in San Diego, hands down! I come from Pacific Beach, and it’s so close and easy to pop in for a quick spray.

I really love how natural the tans always look. I get so many compliments every time I get tanned, and people think it’s just my natural skin! :) my skin has never felt more glowy, and I feel so confident wearing no makeup whenever I have my fresh tan. I’ve never ever been orange after getting sprayed here and I love how they’re able to achieve a naturally deep tan look on my skin tone.

Besides the amazing results, you definitely need to see how cute the salon is inside. The interior is so bright and welcoming, and definitely so different from how tanning salons usually look. It also smells so good - absolutely no icky spray tan smell anywhere to be found! I’m so happy that Blush is able to stay open through COVID and I definitely feel safe coming here since they follow all of the COVID protocols. I’ll never go to another spray tan salon, I’m so obsessed with the tans here!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAuo4QbRRKpMECUKtK5051MkAVaA72nalpdyY_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx9gi3U7vyZd3LWumQHG6R6Y9leUx9Bxjo-6aW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi98PY6qtDZJaS4gjz4eFnNQfrhvve3Jrpctrv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPeMiamoD57dVZOiHTYqjYovkQd9Bj6Tl5OTu0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3Vez5Ukj0rd1kxKWelji4v48298pm6yof0c-j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1603381589722, 'text': "Hi Sara, thank you for your review!

<text>Hands down one of the best tans and experiences I have ever received! Prior to my appointment, I received a phone call with all the pre-tan instructions as it was my first spray tan and I was nervous! The day of my appointment, I was happily greeted and asked many questions to find my perfect color. After my appointment, I was thoroughly educated about what to do after my tan and informed about the best products to use! My tan looked so natural and lasted almost two weeks, I couldn’t be happier. Thank you again so much!! Also, the studio was absolutely gorgeous, I couldn’t get enough of all the REAL plants and blush pink everything!<//text>< pictures>

I had Cienna airbrushing me & She made me feel so comfortable. She answered all of my questions and walked me through each step of the process. I am extremely pleased with the outcome of my tan. My skin looks FLAWLESS..Not to mention she did a great job of making me look dark & golden & not orange. I definitely recommend coming here for all your spray tanning needs.< /review>< user>

I can't say enough great things about BlushTan in LaJolla! I used their services for my engagement photos in November, and then again for my wedding in early December. Their recommendations for when to come in, so that my tan would be the perfect shade for photos, was spot on! They also provided great instructions for post-spray - what to do and not do to help extend the tan. I had Megan both times, and she was so friendly and helpful! I've already recommended BlushTan and will continue to do so.<//Review>

The best organic spray tan in San Diego! The studio is really cute, clean and professional. The solutions are organic and my tan faded evenly and naturally. They match the perfect color to your skin tone and complexion. I really like that they appeal to the everyday girl (see posters in studio!).  The owner tanned me and she was amazing!</Text>

The first two times I went here was for my pre wedding consultation tan and wedding tan. I used to go to a cheaper place but thought it would be better to go with a more professional place for an important day. After my experiences, the price at Blush tans seems like a great deal. My appointments were with Allison D and Megan H, and both were very professional (especially in the time of COVID) and friendly! Best part was the tans lasted for a week if not longer and didn't smell (I hate that fake tan smell)!!! Also a bonus that it is organic, I hadn't really considered it before but now I think its a very important factor! Only tricky part is that it is located in La Jolla which can be tough to find parking - just plan out your appointment time well!</Text>

The studio is very clean and cute and everyone was so nice. Claire did my spray tan and she did an amazing job! My tan was so natural and flawless—I’m still getting compliments a week later. There were no streaks or splotches anywhere and my tan actually looked better than when I go on vacation. She was so knowledgeable and made the process so easy for my first time.

<Text>Love getting my Blush spray tans!  My tans usually lasts for over a week and the color is so natural looking. The studio is very modern, clean, and welcoming. I felt so comfortable the whole time. The spray tan is organic/natural and not sticky at all! The courtyard that Blush is located in feels like it's straight out of Europe...so cute!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Natalie did a fabulous job tanning me and made me feel so comfortable getting my first spray tan! She answered the many questions I had very clearly and gave me all the information I needed to ensure my tan lasts! My custom tan turned out beautifully and looks so natural. You can really get any level of darkness and choose the undertone you want to get the perfect tan. Would definitely recommend!< /Text>

<text>So happy to have found a quality spray tan in San Diego! They ask several questions to make sure they’re picking the right color for you, and it faded really evenly. So far I’ve tried two different tones on the lighter side, but will go for a darker shade before my Hawaii trip.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

It was my first time spray tanning ever, so my nerves were very high as I didn't know what to expect. When I arrived, I was greeted by Natalie who made me feel comfortable and welcomed. She guided me through every step and made the process easy and fun at the same time. She was very professional and did an excellent job. It's been almost 5 days since my appointment and I still look bronzed and glowy. I will defintely be coming back and like she told me "You're going to get addicted to spray tanning", I can see how I already am! Thank you Natalie!<//Review>

I now know the difference between Blush and other spray tans. Personalized color, no smell, no sticky residue, and a helpful staff. My attendant was able to help me personalize my color and she tanned every crevice!  I am the founder of a cellulite smoothing / body contouring business, Bodylab La Jolla and Blush will be a great pairing for my Ladies :). Thanks, Tamara Renee<//Text>

<resp>None</resp><text>OMG this was one of my best experiences with a hairstylist! I had the pleasure of working with Zach who took me on my journey from long hair to short hair. He was very helpful in helping me figure out what I want, explaining how to take care of my curly/wavy hair, and making me feel very comfortable with him. We laughed SO MUCH! I even told him about my previous experience with a hair dresser who had burned my scalp a little because they put the hairdryer on for too long, and he immediately told me that I should always let my hairdresser know if it's getting too hot. All in all my experience was 21/10 because of Zach and his genius work with my curls! Thank you! <3<//text><Gmap_id>0x80db1ba6f0d582f9:0x5eacda69e7537dcc</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Many thanks to my stylist Eddie O. @ Salon Jarick!  It's a very classy & clean salon AND Eddie has impeccable training & skills.  He is always professional, knowledgable, flexible, AND affordable.  Not to mention, very focused & patient with my long & naughty hair... Most importantly he makes me look beautiful before I leave the salon!!!</text>

The color came out perfect and I appreciated his attention to detail with the cut. He asked questions, gave recommendations and I am very happy with his work.

The salon was clean with limited occupancy and is in a great central location with private parking. I recommend this place.

Thanks again, Zac!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

It was a gloomy day that I thought of treating myself. I saw this hair salon nearby that was offering an excellent service. I heard good feedback about their service, and I was glad that it was truly right. From their customer service up to their hairstylist, they were all very friendly and accommodating. I am very happy with the overall service they had rendered. I loved my new hair!</Review>

Make sure to book your appointment with Zac if you have curly or wavy hair!  He is so skilled at what he does and I always enjoy watching him transform my hair! He has taught me how to keep my waves and curls frizz-free, and he always takes his time when I go in for a cut. Thank you, Zac!< /review>

<text>Have no idea who to go with? Want someone to give you an honest opinion of what's going to look good or not? Want someone who double and triple checks that you both are on the same page about what's about to go down with your hair? Want someone who ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW TO CUT CURLY HAIR? Zac is your man! He's patient, has passion and is so attentive! He used to work in Redlands before working in Palm Springs and let me tell you, as Marvin Gaye once said "there ain't no mountain high enough,

I did a cut and full head of foils with Zac and he is a MAGICIAN! I was delighted with how he transformed my awful covid hair (7 months without a cut or color). Ended up really stylish and perfectly blended. Highly recommend.<//text>

Waited 3 months until he was able to cut hair again because I don’t trust anybody else with my hair now. He is the first person to get my hair to look the way I pictured it in my head. Well worth the 3 hour round trip of drive to see him.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

AWESOME Beauty shop in the area! I will definitely be back here again because you made me very happy when you did a haircut on me last Friday afternoon. I also observed that the place was very cleaned and well-organized. Expect me to call and use your Beauty shop again and again. A high rating and a strong recommendation for you!<//Text>

If you are a curly headed person may I introduce you Zac Bohannon, he is an expert with curly hair. Visit him you will not regret it plus it is a bright and pleasant salon. He is a twenty in my book!< /text>

<Review>I visited this salon for the first time yesterday.  Everyone was taking precautions as necessary during the pandemic but the atmosphere was still friendly.
My favorite stylist from Redlands recently moved here and I followed him because he is the ONLY person who can deal with my curly hair.  I didn’t need to worry about it for the three months of lock-down as his cuts still look great months afterwards.  He really pays attention to how each curl lays.  He has an abundance of positive energy too.
The salon is great, but Zac is the best!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>We love Zac! We were so sad to hear he was leaving the salon we’ve gone to for years in Redlands but were more than happy to make the drive out to Palm Springs to have him do all three teenage boys’ hair. Zac is such a professional, listens well to his clients and is an artist, working with each person’s individual hair type and style wishes.  He is easy to talk to and gives great tips and advice. We can not recommend him highly enough and feel like Salon Jarick is lucky to have him!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I had an appointment with the absolute best hairstylist ever. Angelika turned me into a whole new person! I’m obsessed with how talented she is. My hair was just not looking cute the color was brassy and I didn’t want to do anything with it and now I’m styling it all the time. I’ve had so many compliments and I’m so happy!!  I will definitely recommend her to everyone.<//review>< Pics>

New hairstylist Zac did such an amazing job on my hair! I have curly hair & I have never trusted anyone with my hair the way I trust Zac. It always turns out looking flawless, my curls are always happy after seeing him!
Zac cuts and dyes my moms curly hair as well & she is always super happy with the results, he’s an amazing colorist as well!<//review>

<Review>I was very hesitant to changing my stylist, but after a trusted friend insisted I try Eddie, I gave in.  I am so glad I did.  My hair was in desperate need of serious attention as I was long overdue for a highlight and cut. Eddie listened to what I wanted, made suggestions, and made it happen. The salon had an awesome retro Palm Springs vibe.  Everyone was inviting and friendly.  I’m excited for  my next appointment.< /Review>< Pics>

Came here for some chowder and fried fish. I was not disappointed with the quality of the food. The soup chowder was good and I love the fact that they actually use clams. There were some thick meaty clams on my chowder, but it was a little thin for me, I'm used to a thicker soup, but none the less delicious. The fried fish, was good, but breading was lacking some flavor. Food was cooked to order, took probably 10-15 min for it to be ready. Ceviche was delicious.<//text>

VERY fresh fish! So fresh that some days menu items are not available which is a GOOD thing. They do not over use the fry oil so everything tastes fresh. They make their own Cole Slaw and dressing.  The dressing is well balanced so it is NOT too sweet as many dressings tend to be. HIGHLY RECOMMEND (prices good too!)<//review>

<Review>The jumbo deep fried shrimp were cooked to perfection. So meaty. They are in transition to new ownership and are in the process of changing the menu to purely shrimp Mexican style. I enjoyed this meal and look forward to what they will be like in the near future.< /Review><Response>None<//Response><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

Best fish and chip ever! My regular stop was closed today, so Googled this place. Glad I  did. Told them this was my first time and the owner gave me some free samples. Also ordered the scallops and they were perfect. Even the fries were awesome. I'm not a big fries person, but these reminded me of the old Johnny Shrimp Boat downtown L.A. back in the day. Definitely making these my new regular place.< /Text>

Basic, basic, basic. No seasoning on the fish, none in the batter, very plain and bland. Service was decent, but they need fountain drinks instead of canned drinks.

Only reason for the 3 stars; the clam chowder was actually on point! Very good 👍 It's the only thing I will get here if I ever come back.</Review>

Nice little place.  Food was priced very fair. The service is prompt, polite, and friendly.
See the pics I posted of their fish n chips, 5 nice sized pieces of fish, crispy fries not overcooked. And only $6.50 per order.
I was expecting higher prices for this quality
.
I only give it 4 stars because a cold pint of ale would have been good, but they don't serve beer or spirits.
Otherwise this is a great place to come and I will return again.< /review>

It is now Mariscos Camaron Loco.  Service was slow because of grand opening. Food not horrible. It came nice and hot on a mix of restaurant and disposable plates. Flavor OK but unremarkable.   It was cold outside and under 60°F inside. They had live music start up, which made it too noisy.  They were serving a new menu.  They offered two free tacos, but brought only one. This place has potential, but we did not see it today.  I hope they correct the faults and stay in business.< /review>

This is a hidden gem of a spot. I came in and let Adriana know I was a new customer. She accommodated me from there by dropping two types of fish to assist me with making a choice. Both were delicious hot fresh and NOT greasy at all. The combo she made for me was basically off the menu! The restaurant is clean and customer service is great. I ordered ceviche and clam chowder before I left just because. If you are in the area give them a try.<//review>

Opening Day - Definitely coming back. They opened on 2/3/17 so thought I'd go down and give it a try at lunch. They weren't quite ready at 11:30 so I went back at 2:30 pm. I ordered some food to share with the office. We got fish and chips with the New Zealand ocean perch, the Louisiana Catfish (and chips), and then 4 tempura jumbo shrimp.
The first thing that caught me was the price. The price is extremely reasonable.  All three items were less than $20 together. I waited about 8 minutes for the food to cook up. That seemed pretty speedy. When I got back to the office and opened the boxes, they contained the following:
1. 4 pieces of tempura jumbo shrimp. They were of good size and one of my coworkers was excited that they actually cleaned out the shrimp correctly.
2. 4 pieces of ocean perch and a couple handfuls of fries.
3. 4 pieces of catfish and a couple handfuls of fries.
4. 2 small containers of tartar sauce
5. 2 small containers of Frank's Red Hot sauce
6. A medium container of Cole Slaw
7. Napkins

It looked good, so we got some plates and took what we wanted. I love shrimp so that was the first thing I tried. It not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. Light batter, good quality shrimp. Then I tried the perch and chips. Again, light batter, juicy fish, good tasting overall. Fries were done just right, not soggy but not super crispy.  My co-worker who had the catfish said it reminded her of being in Mississippi.

We'll definitely be back. When replacing a historic business like The Mug, it's nice when the new place lives up to those expectations.<//text>

Oh my what an experience. We missed our turn and ended up turning around in their lot. Another reason to not judge a building by it's facade. After a quick review of Yelp it looked like it was a place to visit. We had the cod fish and chips, a bowl of chowder and ceviche. Marvelous food. A loyal following goes here and I'm telling you; miss your exit and go here! Beat fish and chips, period. I will be returning when in the San Bernardino area.<//Review>

Not the best fish house and not the worst. Basket of shrimp was really good and the clan chowder was better than okay. The kids meal is not really for kids. His hush puppies were jalapeño spiced. Fish and chips was greasy and mushy. But the bathroom has been remodeled. Over all it deserved a 3 from me<//review>

<review>The food was out of this world. The atmosphere was really clean the tables were nice not sticky. The building is air condition very well smells really good inside with the cooking fish and the ceviche was like from another planet it was so good. I was able to taste the fried catfish I also received a whole fried tilapia which was excellent the tilapia came with onions and jalapenos on the side I forget what that's called but it was great addition to the tilapia. And they have Mexican Coke and tons of other beverages that you would very much like.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Another Goodwill bites the dust.  I don't know WHAT the "bosses" are thinking! The "Color of the week" was a fantastic marketing tool. At least this location agreed it wad a bad idea and acknowledged the customers dissatisfaction.  Another location losing sales,  losing customers.  Falla's and Ross is right next door, with better prices for new items.  SERIOUSLY,  Goodwill,  get it together.< /Text>

Well, I am not a big Good Will Fan because of how they raise their money, price their product and at times run the North Bay shops.  That being said, the staff are fine, it is always clean and organized and they turn over merchandise pretty regularly so it is good thrift and in a neighborhood who need it to be close and easy!<//review>

Largest Goodwill in Santa Rosa. 5/5 stars for Goodwill standards. Large selection of clothing, books, toys, furniture, and house wares. If you are looking for really cheap furniture or like looking through the bins, check out the Goodwill Outlet on Yolanda Ave.<//Review>

I hear the staff laughing all the time or singing when I am in the store. The store is clean and colorized with great merchandising. The pricing is not too bad neither. $8.99 for adult jeans and $2.99-$3.99 for kids jeans, it's a bargain.</review>

This particular Goodwill store has the largest selection of books and literature. I occasionally go there for books and am always surprised by how many I find that interest me.  It's well organized, and decently priced especially if you find the right color tag (s).</review>

I think that Ross has very nice merchandise at reasonable prices, HOWEVER! I feel the customer service is less than up to par. I really love Ross, but I find myself walking right on by to the neighboring stores to shop. I don't go into Ross for the same reason I don't go into Wall Mart.I go to Target instead and would rather pay the higher prices at Target to not have to deal with the long lines, the noise or the closed end conversations with the cashiers. In not asking to have a full conversation.  ( believe me) but at least look at someone when they are speaking to you and say hello. It happened 3 times with three diffrent cashiers. So I just don't go in there anymore. Hopefully you can start a customer service class?</text>

So I get that Goodwill is second hand. That said does it also require second rate service? The cashier at this location was more interested in her cell phone than the customers. The rudeness of the employee is unacceptable and is shocking even for a second hand store.

The discounts are just not worth the disgusting service that Goodwill is projecting.< /text>

A few years ago this was an ok store with good manager and staff...now this store has gone down the toilet...RUDE CASHIERS, WHO ACTUALLY FROWN AND INSULT CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE SELECTED USED ITEMS TO MAKE THEM PART WITH THEIR HARD-EARNED-MONEY!  So do we get a new manager?  Do we get rude cashiers fired and replaced?  Or does this store go deeper and deeper down the toilet?  Rude staff and overpriced for Goodwill.< /Review>

Every Goodwill location has it's strengths and weaknesses. This one's magor strength is it's book selection. This one I only recently discovered because it is so far across town, it's half way to Sebastopol...but I'm so glad I did find it! It is huge! I can't speak to the clothing or furniture much. It seems a bit dingy. I have found some decent kids clothes but it required a lot of digging. A decent knick knacks section, but again not in and of itself a draw. The books though, wow. When you walk in and look to your left it looks like a book store. I asked a staff 'why so many books?' and she told me that the lady who chooses what goes into this location really focusses on books, essentially curating what gets stocked. It's a beautiful thing. I love to bring my two girls here to come pick out a book as a treat. Great kids section! Another bonus is that this location stays open later than other Goodwills in town.</review>

<Text>The night manager, brian sesco touches the employees unappropeatly.  My girlfriend for one,  I've seen him , and I've spoken to him about this. He says, " call corporate."  "They are waiting on your call." Like this happens all the time or something. It's a shame too, he has a wife and a kid at home.  I hope they find out about him before it's to late. He closes the store alone with my now, ex gf. Doesn't seem right.  Idk.

He then tells me,  i nolonger can come into the store. Hmmm i wonder.
Iwont be coming  back to this goodwill or any other.  Ill shop the competition.  Keep an eye on this guy.</Text>< gmapID>

The new manager isn't as helpful as the previous. Items are WAY over priced ($60 for a used dish set that's going for $25 on EBay) and items are often separated instead of batched or grouped.

I hope there is a new manager soon.<//review>

This place has a lot of what you need. Comparable to a dollar tree or 99 cent store. Pricing will vary. Always a got to store for my last minute items.< /Text>

< Review>
Love this place. Super good prices and good name brand products for a really good price. I come in here needing 1 thing and I end up with 20 items lol. I would definitely recommend. This place pretty much has everything except groceries.<//Review>

<text>I shop here alot for myself and doggy. Best place to get deals on quick things you need. I always ended up buying 20$ of stuff when I'm here. They didn't have much for Halloween, so that sucked and they stopped selling the dog carriers and such. Wish they bring it back. Over all great store pretty clean, good deals and the staff are nice.</text>< Pictures>

I go here pretty much all the time, staff knows me and my dog. Prices are always amazing they keep everything I stock, I usually can find what I need. I enjoy coming to this place because, it's not to far from where I live.< /Review>

You need it they have it. Very large, mom and pop style store. So much packed in to this place, but somehow they manage to keep everything easy to find. Assistant/cashier was very nice and helpful, and very polite.</text>

<Review>I hosted an 8.1 mile out and back hike on May 23, 2021 to Mount Baden-Powell. The parking is free directly at the trailhead and is free.

The trail is a moderate climb of 4 miles of switchbacks and with some pretty stunning views all the way up and down. I would say it's more of a moderate hike, I think if you have a few recent 10 mile or so hikes under your belt, you will do just fine. My favorite part is the last few hundred yards to the summit, where you have cliffs on both sides of you, I posted a video to my Google account.

Enjoy your hiking.< /Review>< pics>

Pretty cool abandoned gold mine inside. Some of the trail got a lil narrow with sliding rocks & the wood inside the mine is very old & soggy from the moisture but it is a super cool hike.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>great historical place to visit. very peaceful trail. once you enter the main trail there is a fork with an unmarker sign. the right take you to the old mines, it is a bit of a hike but worth it, some parts can be a little difficult but take your time.
the left fork will take you to the old cabin, which still has some great artifacts which I am glad people are respecting and leaving untouched.
this trail is easy and relaxing to find the cabin can be a little confusing, on the trail you will hike a bit and come across a fallen tree or log on the right side of the trail. go over that log and continue on the trail for a little bit and the cabin comes into sight. there are plenty of youtube videos showing directions to the cabin. people are nice. We have been there several times with and without our dogs.

everyone for the most part has a mask on when they approach you .</review>< pictures>

Not sure why this place it's not called big horn mine because 90% of people that go here is to go see big horn mine not Vicente gulch. Any who this place is beautiful. We hiked to big horn mine small hike about 4 miles round trip some shade not too much. We did this hike early morning on a Saturday. We started the hike at 7 am done by 11am.< /Review>

If its winter time, November-March, buy some cleats for your shoes.  Strap ons at Big 5 cost $20.  Or even Amazon. It will be worth every penny.  Theres a lot of ice which will cause nasty falls.  Beautiful vistas,  not crowded, and refreshing mountain air.   Enjoy< /text>< pics>

Unsafe place, the mine has recently caved in, and the ceiling in of the tunnels collapsed and now  is completely blocked,  don't risk your life. If you get inside the mine avoid the rigth tunnel and the deepest part of the main tunnel there's another collapsed are there.<//text>

<Text>Super fun! Two different trail heads and I did both. The trail to the left goes to Big Horn Mine approximately 2 miles in and 2 miles back, and to the right is Baden Powell Peak approximately 4 miles in and 4 miles out. I did both in one day, started at about 5:45am and completed both by 2pm<//Text>< user>

< review>
The divide is home to a large paved parking area, a single bench under nearby trees, an information sign post (not frequently updated) and a restroom facility.  This area has no water (unless cached by Trail Angels) and no cell phone service (unless high up on the mountains). It is a starting point for several nearby trails. A Forest Adventure Pass is required to park here. Weekend activities are high and parking can fill up early.</review>

Perfect place to test the temperment of a future partner. The hike to Mt Baden-Powell is a real challenge, and is known for the many switchbacks. This is also the location where people drop in and hike to Bighorn Mine that goes down to Middle Earth. I've heard some gnarly stories about the mine and people passing out down there. Go with your gut instinct if you run out of air down there. The oak ladders will break as you try to get out. Follow the arrows.</review>

Good place to hike. There's a big parking lot and it's relatively safe. I've hiked the trails around the parking lot and I've never had an issue with vandalism or theft. There are bathrooms near the parking lot and a bench to rest.< /Review>

<Text>The starting point for several hiking trails. This is the area where everyone can park to hike. The time we went the road was still closed. So we have to park the car at the grassy hollow area.< /Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) 🚘oct 23, 2019 It was freezing. 🚶‍♂️ It was great to have hiking courses in many directions.
I had a great time at Mt. Powell.

< Review>
Both times I've taken my vehicle to Splash @ Van Buren, he and his team have done an excellent job.  They go above and beyond to take care of their customers, including washing and vacuuming the car after the work is done!  The service here is top notch, which is why they have so many 4 star reviews.  I would recommend this place to everyone.  I'm going to make them some cookies.</Review>

<text>Well in the past I was pleased with the services but the last time, I  Went was a week ago, I payed for the inside of my car to be Shampooed and detailed well they never took off the front seat covers and they were Gonna let me drive off but good thing. I check my front seat covers and they were  Dry. I know that was just dishonest but it was the workers not the manager or the owner.</text><Rate>2< /Rate></record>

I was so happy to find an open car wash. Since the water district has asked us to refrain from any outside water use, my car was filthy. It was so nice to be able to get my car washed. They did an excellent job.< /Review>

Paid for a full detail, $150 and they did a terrible job. They said they were going to clay bar the car and they used a spray on wax. They did my wife's car and didn't touch the inside of the car when we requested that. Never going back< /Review>

< Review>
My trucks and car's come out of this business looking pretty clean while I just relax or enjoy there free donuts. Not the fastest place but quality is more important to me. All these places can give your vehicle's a scratch or maybe even a ding, not the end of the world. I get what I want out of the deal here a clean looking vehicle that smells good. Hard working people here, not the easiest job after a full day of servicing vehicles. I ought  know,  this was one of my first jobs while I was in High school back in the day.</Review>

<Review>Waaaaaayyyyy overpriced!  They do not want your business here.

They wanted $60 to do a handwash on my SUV.  I live in La and usually pay $35 for this service.  When I go to Beverly Hills I have paid $40 for a hand wash.  So why $60?  Because we are in the Rodeo of Riverside.

I guess in prestigious Woodcrest they demand insane prices.

I asked if they could just vaccuum and they wanted $10.
I ended up giving the worker $5 to just vaccuum my own car by myself!  Lol

The employees are probably enforcing the owner's policies so I recommend trying to evaluate if you are really providing double the value compared to other locations?< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1571763132532, 'text': 'Robert, We appreciate you sharing feedback regarding your visit.

<text>First, the employees in the front are very rude, and never greet customers as they pull in. I stood their for about 5 minutes, until one of them decided to come and help me, and didn't even apologize for the long walt or say hello. Second, I tried go give them several chances with cleaning my car but I'm not going back anymore. They do NOT pay attention to detail and they do NOT clean cars correctly. There is always water marks, dirt on the tires, and they don't vacuum thoroughly. Not worth my money or time here. Sadly, lost another customer and I will not be recommending.<//text><resp>None</resp>< rate>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>If I could give this place zero stars I would! I came in with my husband today with both of our cars. After waiting an hour my car was ready. As I walked up to my car I noticed dirt still on the bumper, opened my door and was in total disbelief nothing was wiped down nor vacuumed. The customer care gentleman immediately apologized and I went inside to get a refund. Mind you, my husband truck still isn’t done. As I walked inside an older man (the owner) approached me and said let me take a look at your car. As he looked at my car he claimed they don’t wipe down windows, doors, vacuum the inside, wipe seats, cup holders, etc. The list goes on. I told him I was very upset with my car and I would like it to be fixed. He was beyond rude and shouted at me and told me to leave and have a nice day! I nicely told him he will not be getting my business back and I will write a horrible review. Bank has started my dispute of $50! That I paid for this horrible car wash. Never again will I be coming here!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>3</rate><review>The  2 times i went it was great! I usually always go to this car wash and sometimes its a hit and or a miss with how well they clean my car. My front bumper tends to get dirty alot especially with bugs and a younger guy took the time to really clean my front bumper and i really did appreciate that. But this last time, another guy didnt do that, even after i asked the head guy outside who monitors the workers on cleaning to please make sure this other guy cleans my front bumper, it still wasn't done well enough. I could tell the guy who was cleaning my car just didnt want to put much elbow grease into scrubbing my bumber clean!</review>< Response>

I went in there at 8am one of the first ppl there and it took 4 hours to to a wash and a detail. I know a detail takes awhile to do but after it was finally finished I noticed they broke the stem off my tire and it was 100 percent flat. Which they could have told me the second it happened but didn’t. They took the tire off but refused to pay for the damage they did. And I ended up having to walk with my 8 and 4 year old and a popped tired to a tire shop to get a new one.<//Review>

<Text>Pretty good. Would be better if it were 100% hand wash and if they invested in a shade structure for their employees to dry the cars under. 4 stars because they often miss the tiny yellow bird droppings on the top of my car and never clean the painted areas of my wheel wells.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Paid for super wash, clay bar, and hand wax treatment.  Come back to pickup my car and there was wax residue all over the side and the inside hadn't even been wiped down.  Ask the cashier and they proceed to argue that it doesn't include an interior detail, which wasn't what I was expecting at all, but agreed that it should have been vacuumed out and wiped down.  They "fixed" it by doing no vacuuming and quickly wiping away the wax and the interior.  Not at all worth the $100 I paid for it.<//Text>

The first guy to help was not friendly and openly disappointed that my windows do not roll up. I tried to remain friendly as he brought the manager on duty, hoping they could help me solution seek because I need my car cleaned to try to sell it but they did not even try to help work around my situation and were not nice about it. I understand that maybe their service ability was not a match for my needs but it was incredibly dissatisfied by their customer service, why they could not help and that they couldn't provide helpful alternatives. Would not recommend this location.<//review>

The vacuuming is done so poorly it almost seems like it wasn't even attempted, despite the fact I put all my personal things away to make it easy. Also, i pay extra for armorall and they 'forget' to do it each time. Also, inside back windows were not cleaned, trash is left behind in rear cup holders, etc. It's frustrating. Gotta find a new place.  I don't have time for bad service.</review>< user_name>

Don't go here! They left all the windows in my truck streaky, there were still pine needles in the bed and on the windshield, they hardly vacuumed the interior at all and they didn't wipe down anything like they should have. The one positive thing I can say is that it was fast. Total waste of $20. I will NOT be back!<//Review>

<review>Never again! I stopped by this car wash to get my car washed prior to heading to LAX . I drove up paid 24.95 for the works wash . I proceeded to my car after it was finished ,  tipped the washer girl 5.00 . I got in my car and drove down the street, when I noticed the same bug spots and dirt all over my windshield that was initially on it when I drove it in. I pulled into Walmart and was going to clean it myself when I thought no I paid them 24.95 to wash it right. I drove back to complain and show them the bug and dirt spots all over the windshield. No one there spoke English and when they came back to my car I pointed to what was wrong and the same girl got in my car to clean the dashboard, which wasn’t even dirty ! I pointed again to the windshield and side windows. She wiped it and told me “water-spots I can’t do anything about them” I told her those are not water spots those are bugs and dirt that was on my car when I drove it in. She wiped it hesitantly, and mumbling under her breath . Needless to say I won’t be going back .<//review><gmap_id>0x80dca518750c0997:0x9c4df993d6127f05</gmap_id>< Time>

Do not come here!!!!! Maybe it will get shut down!!! Just left without wash after being rudely greated by the nastiest guy. After telling him I want the $44.95 hand wax + interior dressing. Which I get 2 times a month. He says the interior is an extra $40.00. I'm not getting ripped off just so the grossest rudest guy can put extra money in his pocket.< /review>

I was just refused service by manager. The excuse was that there is a rack on my roof. I had that rack for 10 years and never ever had an issue at that place or any other car wash place. It was obvious that he didn't want to serve us. There are all kinds of people out there, haters included. :( Don't recommend anybody to go there, unless you want to take a chance to see whether they you or not.<//text>

Depends on who cleans your car, depends on the service you receive, I don't like these odds but unfortunately it's how it is.<//Text>

Washed half my car.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to show the attendant how to do his job.  The inside didn't even look clean.  He took 10 mins total and missed the other side of my car.  Never again!</Review>

(Original)

<review>Today I decided to try the Crispy Fish sandwich (next time will try the cajun fish sandwich for variation). My fish sandwich had a truly crispy/crunchy fish patty, shredded lettuce, tartar sauce, & bun (no cheese). It sure was better, heartier, thicker & more filling than McDonald's fish sandwich (which I also like). I will definitely go try their other fish sandwich, probably tomorrow! :)</review>< pictures>

I love Arby’s! Their roast beef has always been great but now they have chicken and turkey! Their chicken sandwiches are better than those at chicken restaurants! Seasoned fries and shakes are great too! No need to eat anywhere else!<//review>

The market place sandwiches are freshly made right when you Order them. The chicken pecan sandwich has apples/grapes     and celery with all the trimmings. So great!!< /review>

< review>
Order 5 sandwiches and 3 orders of curly fries only gets you one ranch dressing.   Beyond that they charge you 0.20 per thing of ranch and then are totally taken aback when I pullout a $1 and say fine.  Got the distinct impression she just didn't want me to have any more ranch.  Fine, I won't be back.< /review>

Typically I'm here twice a month for the last 5 years. This is my last visit.  My double stacked Ruben was cold in the center.  Mint shake dripping down the side. Icing on the cake, this location no longer has Pepsi products and switched to Coke products. Mountain Dew was the one thing keeping me over looking the messed up past orders and the change up in the mid day management over the last year.< /text>

Once I corrected the drive thru person my order was wrong and three ,"****…….'s" and five minutes later got my order (the only difference was cheese BTW).

This is a ok place to stop if you just want to sleep, or maybe to get a drink and take a crap. But if you want anything to eat, keep truckin. We spent the day here on a 34 hour restart. Tried ordering an omlet for b'fast, got burnt scrambled eggs with rotten onions and lettuce. Lettuce! In eggs! Gross! So we tried ordering fries for dinner, and got undercooked grease globs that made us sick. Eat here at your own risk, and only if you want food poisoning. Take my advice, go to the subway at the 18 in the chevron.< /review>

Bel Air is excellent for its service, quality and attention to detail. I appreciate the fact that staff is friendly, and always willing to lend a hand whenever possible - especially to a person who is both disabled & "elderly."     They never act as they are being "put out" when you ask for assistance of any sort - even for the 'silliest' of questions!< /Text>

Basically the biggest reason why I love this store is because of the amazing floral department they have!! I love going to Cathy or April to get a floral arrangement of some sort. They always find a way to surprise me with their incredible talent to arrange such beautiful bouquets. I can’t forget the other girls who work at the floral department as well. They all do an incredible job! And I always walk away so happy. Best floral department I’ve ever been to at any grocery store. I’ve added some beautiful bouquets they have created this year for me!< /review>

And everytime I ask a worker a question, they answer me in a aggressive manner. First time I thought "it's ok maybe they just worked hard today" then it happened again and then AGAIN.

<Review>Scam place.

I walked by butcher department and noticed there was a sign for tri tip $3.77.

I called the butcher and she said here they are. I asked why is the price not adjusted? She said it would ring up on checkout up front. I took 3 packs, she said there was more if I needed more.

I went to cash out and the cashier said they are the right price and went back to double check. I took a picture.

He came back and said no that’s the right price for $7.99 pound and we are out for $3.77.

I said no way she was bringing more out.

He said I can’t help you go talk to her back there.

I went back and noticed the sign was gone and the butcher came out telling man a whole story of how the signed moved and the ones for $7.99 are trimmed and the $3.77 were in trimmed.

I asked to speak to manager. Manager was so rude. Did not offer to honor the price even though mistake was made by employee.

I have never seen a big bag of tri tip ever be sold at Bel Air or Rayles.

Sad.</Review>< pics>

<Text>I had gone to Walgreens and Rite Aid to find a liquid anti-nausea for kids and neither place bothered to even try and help.
I came here and Tatyana comes out from behind the pharmacy counter, goes through the aisles with me and helps me find exactly what my kid needs.
Coming here first next time.
Thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

Besides groceries they also have a pharmacy, butcher, deli, bakery and an official US Post Office branch.
And they now require all customers wear a mask in the store. I feel much safer shopping with everyone sporting masks.

<text>I very politely asked for tahini there was no one in the isles to help. After waiting in line to ask for help I was referred to a supervisor who helped me find the item but I had to stand in line again to check out instead of sending someone to retrieve the item like what happens 100% of the time this happens. I have been shopping here for over 10 years and have never received such poor service. I tried to buy this item online and there was no availability to do so in less than 2 hours. Thank expect better at nicer supermarkets. When I finally was able to check out her person who named Shelby was very polite and the only reason I am leaving g a star at all. I may never shop here again.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Lady at the self check out is useless. She knows we are having trouble with the card reader yet ignores that we are there and proceed to be on their damn phone.  When we finally asked for help, this old hag didn't seem like she wanted to help. Why are you even there?<//review>

<Name>Steven Armond</Name><Review>Came and order a cup cake, cake and it turned out excellent. Only needed one day in advance to prepare and it was very cost effective too which was even better. Very good cup cakes very moist and soft and frosting was really good too not overly sweet like most. Thanks guys for helping make this memory more enjoyable!!! Would definitely recommend checking out there bakery there staff is great!!!!!!!<//Review><time>1572240428595< /time><rate>5<//rate><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV--2LZoecisJYi6_uJ5IDStwK5F8HRqOe1s8-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEmvx1zQzWba0NC8oVahrfTk9hvx2bx0sfUOIn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< userid>

This place is very compact and has a lot of types of fresh food, sea food, a lot of different kinds of alcohol for really good price. This place has a kitchen, a bakery, medical clinic, some type of mail room, flover store, fruit section, household supplies, personal hygiene products, medications for kids and adults. I recommend you to come and check this place out and if you like it leave a comment and rating! Enjoy your trip!:)<//Text>

Clean aisles, good variety, and overall a good experience. You do get the Belair tax but it's a nice place to shop. This location has a Chinese to go next to the deli and bakery which is always my favorite place to stop by. Overall a 5 star experience.<//Review>

<Text>The choice has been made to only encourage mask wearing with posted signage, insteas of enforcing it.

I understand that there is slightly less than half the population who are willing to loudly, and sometimes physically throw tantrums because their role model also acts like a todler. Them being allowed to dictate not only my and my family's safety, but the safety of your employees and their families is not how we do better. It was physically difficult watching smug as heck white men (I am one myself) just flaunt their willful ignorance knowing that they will get their way because they can hold the fear of their rage over peoples heads. This white boy will withold my money.

I feel badly for the manager I spoke to who seemed to me to just be so worn down by it all, myself included (I don't blame her, it's corporate who makes these decisions and managers have to do what they are told or their life is effed). I hope the higher ups realize at some point the correct actions to take, however difficult it may be. Until they do, I can't spend my money here or any affiliated market.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I have been a regular customer of this store since they opened in 1992. They are the best market in Antelope, and they have wonderful employees. In the past few days they have had to deal with the impact of hoards of people and running out of everyday  items. The employees have done a stellar job with this crisis and I want to thank them all for their hard work and patience.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809b27458c00eccf:0x1853152e7f6542fa< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The lady who works in the coffee section was rude. Wish she was that memorable I could’ve remembered her name. First, I wanted to look at the menu and see if I wanted a americano and I seen the lady make a customer a drink so when it was my turn , I asked the employee what was the drink she just made. She looked at me like I asked her a scientific question and didn’t say anything , then said what drink ? I said the drink you just made for that lady.  Then I put my items on the counter for her to check them out right after the manager in deli told me I could pay for my sandwhich at this register , the girl told me I couldn’t pay here smh and was just so rude about it . I didn’t appreciate it because when you work in customer service we expect at least a little tad bit of customer service, engaging, speaking, respecting not just not wanting to answer questions because you don’t want to check me out smh she needs to quit but then again she  could’ve had a bad day</text>

<review>Deli service is pretty shabby. Doesn't ask who was next in line, just starts helping people.. leaving customers to speak up or get skipped.

Zero sense of urgency.. it's like watching people work at the DMV - literally could not move slower.

Last two times I've gone in they were out of either a type of bread or meat... don't understand how a grocery store runs out of meat and bread??</review>< Pictures>

Police around during COVID, separate area for sanitized carts, store is still very clean and they always have a good amount of checkers open and self checkout. Their fruit selection never seems to work with my wic card though.< /text>

Staff is awesome. They're always happy and chipper... great store for organic food and other things. Just so much more pricey. Overall I love this store.< /text>

I stopped here after work at the hospital, i rang up my stuff at self service. The machine said i had an extra item but i didnt move anything. The girl at the counter looked annoyed with me when i needed her help. She then asked Maria to help me even though Maria was off the clock  I over heard. Maria came over and raised her voice louder when talking to me and talked to me like i was stupid. They were both very rude and i was so disappointed with their service.</text>

<review>New to the area, great bel air located within a mile from my home. Friendly service, currently enforcing covid-19 protocols and are even giving out masks at the door for those customers who do not have one! First place ive seen do this, well done! Everything was well plenished and not overcrowded.<//review><Date>1593991336324< /Date><Name>Morriah Antu< /Name>< gmapID>

The produce was great like it is and we found everything we needed there.  Place was very clean and everyone was helpful and fast.  We will most likely still shop here just because it's much more convenient, I just wish they had a few products we can get at Raley's.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Seriously, Bel Air?!  This is the third time I have bought bad meat from you and I am over it. The first time you took old hamburger meat and wrapped it in a layer of new meat - real cute - looks fresh, get home, under the fresh layer all rotten. Second time, rotten sausage meat.  And the last time, a delicious package of spoiled pork chops. Your produce is still decent, but your deli and chinese food have already made us sick, so now with the meat, we'll pass on shopping with you.< /review>

I don't shop here to often because the prices are a little higher but when I do I never have to worry about the quality of what I'm buying. I can always expect a great product and the workers always make my shopping experience very enjoyable. They're always so nice and helpful even my kids are comfortable talking to them and that's a big plus because it keeps them calm and QUIET. Lol great place to shop.<//review>

This store is a grocery/convenient store for people who are afraid to go to WinCo and Walmart. It's nice but everything is way over priced.<//review>

<Review>To be honest, the prices are a bit higher than the Winco across the street. But it’s worth it rather than the weight, and every time I bring my kids, they can have axis to fruit that is provided as Snacks. I have a coffee Bar, hot Chinese food, sandwich bar, deli section, seafood and selected steak meat section.< /Review>< user>

<text>Good higher end meat cuts and nice fruit selection. All the refrigerated sections are behind doors with lighting that turns on with movement for energy saving. Could use a little better fresh vegetables selection and the phone app and rewards program structure sucks so not quite 5 stars.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
At the deli counter after waiting about 5 minutes the first thing this lady says after looking up from the counter she's been focused on is "yeah, it's going to be a while" nothing more , no hello , hi ,how are you, and then a continued diesregard for me and my wife's presence. Literally a different employee came over to help us after seeing us abandoned at the counter. Thanks for the experience.<//Review>

I have bought tin foil, plastic wrap and sandwich bags all bad. The bags rip open.

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This review is for the Peet’s counter. The girl that served us today was sooo rude, first of all she was wearing her earphones, I came up to the counter and she kind of gave me a dirty look, and came up, no greeting, nothing just like staring, I told her what I wanted she didn’t say a word just started making the coffee and that’s it, and she got two of the drinks I ordered wrong, so maybe it’s time to pull those earphones out of your ear! She just kind threw the coffee as if I’m forcing her to work there. If you hate your job so much find something else that will make you happy, but showing me your attitude is definitely not gonna make anyone’s life better. I’m paying for my coffee and I except it to be made correctly and at least hear a hello or have a good day and not a death stare. Used to be my go to spot but after this kind of service I’d rather make my own coffee!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Belaire and Raley's are wonderful stores to visit, if you don't mind paying a bit more. The deli and produce departments are always clean and well-stocked, and the store has a great selection of natural foods. They offer some good ways of saving money, too, with $5 Mondays, personalized coupons, and their Something Special shopper card. And when they do have something on sale, it's usually a substantial discount.<//Text>< Pictures>

I just dropped by to pick up a cake for my sons Birthday today. I saw they had really nice looking single slices of cake for sale which is perfect because there are only 3 of us. I asked a young lady behind the counter if she can write Happy Birthday on the slice of cake. She flat out said no. Just in case she thought I ment the top of the slice rather than the side of the slice where there was plenty of room I asked if it could be written there. Yes but you wont be able to read it was her response. I thought it was worth the shot. Clearly irritated by my request her and another young woman I believe the baker exchanged some whispering and laughs I'm presuming at my expense. When she came back to the counter I asked if I could pay for the cake there at the register, and I asked twice how did it turn out, ignored twice I turned the cake around myself and it looked great and I said so. Rather than say thank you she mentioned no one had ever made such a request.  and to wrap things up I asked if I could have a bag and she literally tossed it ontop of my cake...I asked if she would mind bagging it. She did, I thanked her and she turned around and walked away without a peep. Pretty sad customer service, I didn't realize you could ruin a person's day for asking them to do a little extra. I've been to this store plenty of times and have always had great customer service from the checkers and people on the floor when I picked out wine for Christmas. This was pretty disappointing.</text>

Very convenient for the quick visit... since its not too big of place.  I especially like the deli counter for healther choices of quick lunch instead  of fast food.   Other than produce being too expensive, I like the store.  I shop here weekly.</Review>

Went for to get Chinese food the service was good. The food was terrible and hardly any selections to choose from. If the service wasn't good, I would of only rated a 1 only because there is no zero.< /Review>

Love this store. Today I ordered delivery for the fist time with a grocery and it was the best experience. Especially because I was trying use instacart and long story short I just didn't get it working. I have been shopping with this particular store for a few years. Always appreciate there fresh produce. Great meat counter, deli counter. Always a clean store. Thank you so much for all you do!!!! I feel as though I can walk into any Raleys and get quality 🙂< /Text>

They will drop everything to help you find what you need or answer a question. You just can't find this kind of real customer service anymore except at Bel Air and Raleys stores! I especially want to mention the pharmacy staff and how so very attentive and informative they are. I have two sons with special needs that have prescriptions that can be really hard to deal with unless you have a pharmacist who's caring and knows how to cut through all the red tape when dealing with insurance. I would be lost without J.P. and the rest of the staff. I highly recommend this store and it's pharmacy to anyone looking for a personal touch and caring people! 💜💙💜💙💜💙💜💙💜💙<//Review><user_name>Caryl Duvall</user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

This is the place I used to go to growing up and it was always clean and the produce was great. I rarely end up in Bel Air now because the pricing is a bit to high for me but anyone who wants better produce for a higher price tag this place is pretty decent.<//text>

I absolutely love Bel Air and Raley's, I worked for Bel Air in 1990 and was a Meat clerk/Wrapper for the Meat Department.  I would go to whichever store needed coverage due to their meat clerk being out sick, on leave, vacation, etc.  I know Bel Air had very high standards in regards of customer service and products. Hands down I would only buy meat at Bel Air or Raleys. Yes, it may be a little more expensive; however, I can tell you that it is worth every penny.  After working in this industry for over 10 years, I would not buy meat anywhere else.  This location absolutely was great - Customer service, Selection and a very clean store!

I wanted to share:
after this review was posted I received a response from Bel Air thanking me for the review,     which supports the customer service at Bel Air is superior!<//text>

Love Raley's / BelAir. Not 5* only because this particular location; their meat / deli area has a number of arrogant employees. Ask for a fresh filet (@$22/lb) since the packaged area only has 1 left and you need 2 for your Wife's birthday and get that stare of "how dare you inconvenience me by asking me to do my job". There is another lady in the meat department, don't ever ask her for a marinade. Good god I felt 5 years old again about to get whipped for taking a cookie without asking.

Other than that, love this place. Fresh local produce, good organic selection (not that I care), bakery rocks, and who does not love quick Chinese food that is not overly greasy?!</text>

<review>Raleys and Bel air are in some growing pains. The are raising the prices, not giving people careers as much, and using social psychology to make finding food as difficult as possible. 4 locations for almost everything making most shoppers run through the place 8 times to pick up 6 products, bleach and light bulbs across from frozen vegetables, nothing makes sense except it's just not a good choice anymore.

If your going to pay ridiculous prices, go to the coop, nugget, or whole foods and at least save your self some time and get better staffing and assistance.

Most the time there are more managers than courteousy clerks or checkers now.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Love Raley's / BelAir. Not 5* only because this particular location; their meat / deli area has a number of arrogant employees. Ask for a fresh filet (@$22/lb) since the packaged area only has 1 left and you need 2 for your Wife's birthday and get that stare of "how dare you inconvenience me by asking me to do my job". There is another lady in the meat department, don't ever ask her for a marinade. Good god I felt 5 years old again about to get whipped for taking a cookie without asking.

Other than that, love this place. Fresh local produce, good organic selection (not that I care), bakery rocks, and who does not love quick Chinese food that is not overly greasy?!< /review>

I love this store is small and thestaff is always super friendly. I have a family of 7 and it can be pricy. I shop the sales and Raley's dailies and save a ton of money for better quality than most other stores.<//review>

Love this store. I generally go here for their baked goods. It's Bel air so its expensive for most things but you get what you pay for. Staff is great you have a bager, they still help people to their vehicles, and this place is never PACKED which I really have come to appreciate going to cheaper stores and standing in massive lines smh<//Text>

The store is too expensive. I can purchase the same salad dressing at WinCo over a dollar cheaper and bel air calls it a sale. This is why I keep shopping at WinCo< /Review>

<Review>I'm new to the neighborhood. There are 2 grocery stores across the street from each other. Bel Air has quality products. The store is clean and well laid out. Prices are higher than Winco across the street but available name brands are better at Bel Air. Customer Service is more readily available at Bel Air but those who are cost minded, Winco has quality products and better pricing. Last comparison,  Winco is a GIANT store and shopping is time consuming.  Bel Air is a good size store with a butchers shop, hot and cold food to go, a full service grocery store, easier in and out.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><rating>4</rating>< response>

Employees are always nice and helpful.  I recommend using their ecart shopping service. It saves you time and money. My only issue with the ecart service is the bag swap program. I have many bags in possesion and they tend to forget my bags then charge me for not having bags. After talking to whoever may help you they take care of the bag fee! Great program i definitely recommend it!< /review>

<Text>Been a customer since the store first opened in 1991 or so. Had one of the original Bel Air Customer Cards. Had two children build careers through this store and then moving on/up in the Raley's System. My family has supported Bel Air / Raley's in numerous ways throughout the years. But recently was MOST disappointed in the new "check cashing" system.  Since last November, I've had checks denied four times. The first three times the store manager would come over and override the system and told me to call for him if it happens again. But the last time I was so angry I will do my best to put my money somewhere else.  The problem is not with my checks. I have never written a bad check. And the funds, in the last few years, are auto-deducted from my account just about immediately.

I called the number referred to on the "declined" receipt to find out why. And the reason? It's because Raley's management has arbitrarily put a dollar cap on the amount of checks they'll take from a customer within a certain amount of time. So basically, because I always write checks, I'm spending too much money?  Well alrighty then, I guess I'll take my "too much money" and spend it somewhere else.

Thanks, Raley's, for bringing this to my attention and embarrasing me for being such a loyal customer.<//Text>< Rate>
