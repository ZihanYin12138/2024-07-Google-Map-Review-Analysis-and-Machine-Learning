<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I would give them more Star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ this is the way every dealership should be. I went in told them about my situation they told me that they could tell me if they can do it or not but he would need to see my credit before sending it to any bank, but it was up to me if I wanted to run my credit no pressure at all. I assumed I wasn't going to get approved but I wanted to know so he ran my credit and said there's a good chance I can get it done, do you want to proceed so I can send it to the bank I work with, he asked me before doing anything and I got the truck.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzmbvQHXHgwV2XVSuSPQ2FhPF-GgmAXQFxQzwD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk8o7qGBZgiSMcBay4GkGXWb9qdHcq_83o7ULk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I wish I could give them 10 stars! These guys are amazing and really go above and beyond to treat you professionally and honest. HONEST is hard to find when finding purchasing a car. From the moment we contacted them we had nothing but professionalism and great communication. We purchased a car from out of state and these guys went above and beyond to help us get this deal closed in a matter of days. We highly recommend them and they have an amazing selection of vehicles that is obvious they take pride in. When we picked up our vehicle there was no rush and we felt valued the entire time. They had the vehicle re-detailed, washed, and ready to go. We will back to purchase our next vehicle from them!</Review>

<text>They have a great selection of high-end vehicles here, and the sales people are very friendly.  I drove from out of state to come here and purchase a vehicle since their prices were much lower than the ones in my state. I would highly recommend purchasing from California car company.</text>< Pics>

<text>Great inventory and attentive staff. I have never purchased a car here but, did get to level 2 negotiations. Nathan told me the car I was interested in would sell for the sticker price plus 10% to cover tax and regulation and that's just the way it works. I was a serious buyer until he attempted to be Mr Steadfast salesman. At 55 years old, a guy who loves cars, I've bought a few rides in my day and, no Nathan that's not the way it works. Many car lot staff and or, management act as s if they have 1 in a million cars and will attempt to play on your emotions. With all the car buying tools on line ownership should realize most consumers are pretty educated on their potential purchase. All that said, they have gorgeous inventory and I have never been ignored during my many visits.</text><username>Rob Bordley< /username>< gmapID>

<text>I had to sell my car after salvation which was one of the hardest things for me, I mean not every dealership will offer a good price for it even if considering it's an almost new vehicle. When I got it new from here, at such an advantageous price and so great looking I had no idea I'll  have to deal with such a heartbreaking moment in my life.. I sold it on repokar com for a great price and I'm really happy for that.<//text>< Pictures>

Nathan was very laid back, no pressure sales rep. Got me a great loan on a nice Mercedes. Once I took it off the lot there was a slight noise. Asked Ryan to look into and he was nice enough to fix it. The selection of high-end cars here is amazing. If you are looking for a dream car, this is the place.</Review>

Nice dealer ship with nice cars unfortunately i had a horrible experience i went to look at a couple cars they had that were used waited for a half a hour for some one to assist me finaly when i got some help i felt like i was rushed and kinda descrimnated beacuse im Hispanic they thought i couldnt afford what i asked them to show me so it made me a little upset but i kept my cool finaly i test drive the vehicle  it  had a broken pieces inside the car and the sales man said oh dont wory  it is  easy to fix and it was common problem on this vehicle so i still ignored that  finally i get inside the office i literally talk to the finance or sales man because i gues there all same at this dealership he spends 2 min and starts blowing me off how he cant work with me on the broken pieces and wont budge lowering the price or fixing the problems and kinda pushing me out i was about to spend 35,000 on a used junk here ended up taking my business to villa ford were they helped me with respect and didnt treat me like a cattle just trying to move a car out . I ended up getting a beter deal on 2018 mustang gt350 . Dont judge a book by its cover i had money that day to buy a car and you thought i was some other Hispanic you can take advantage and sell lemmon and throw a high intrest rate think again !!!< /Review>

Had issue with another Car Lot, called CCC and Nathan hooked me up the next day, within 1 hr he had everything processed with a great loan...no need to bargain! Car was for my wife which drove off the lot and experienced an issue with a tire and rim, called Nate & Ryan which in turn told me "No Worries" just bring the car back to them. I will definetely bring my business back to CCC and refer Friends & Family! Jerry & Lorna Happy Customers FYI...My wife told me she had a really good feeling about these guys when we drove away!<//text>

<Review>Good Factory Outlet. Prices are always such a great deal then a typical Express store. But you do find some discounts, and the staff there are very very helpful with just about anything you could ask for.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Terrible service, asked to try on a fitted shirt to see what it would look like on me. The employee told me to try on a generic fitted shirt to see if the size was correct for me first. I told him that it was my size. I know my size already, but he shook his head at me and told me to double check first. Annoyed, I walked into the changing room and put on the generic white shirt and it indeed fit as expected. When I walked back out of the dressing room he had left to attend other customers (I assumed) so I waited a little bit for him to come back.
He didn't return so I took the liberty to try on the fitted shirt I originally wanted to try on. It fit great! I loved it! But I decided not to buy it because of the foul looks I received from the employee after trying it for the remainder of the time at the store. I put it back and left. Very poor customer service. Not accommodating and inappropriate attitude.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

It’s July 3/2019 around 1:30 pm,I wanted to buy T shirts, there an offer buy one get the second one for 5 dollars, I showed the girl ( I didn’t get her name but the blond hair) the two shirts and she said yes you can buy one and get the second one for 5 dollar, I went to the register to pay, the blond hair said some words to cashier by spanish, the cashier said you have to pay 10 dollars not 5 dollars for the second t shirt i told her i asked your mates and she said 5 the cashier replied that this offer is applied on all items on the table, i told her i got both of them from the same table and i even asked your mates she confirmed that for me but the cashier said this t shirt shouldn’t be on that table. It’s very frustrated, dishonest, and not professional management. I am so mad 😡😡< /review>

<rating>4</rating><Text>(Translated by Google) It is a good quality casual and modern clothing store, where you find a wide variety of styles, colors and sizes for the family (with bodies from medium to large xs, s, m, l, xl)

If your body is tall and large and you need sizes xxl, xxxl, or larger, here you will not find clothes of your size.

Their prices are accessible and occasionally their "specials" (offers for those who are not from the north of Mexico) are really spectacular because you can get to pay only 30% of the value of the garment.

On the other hand, it is located inside the mall (commercial plaza) that is just a few steps from the El Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana, so you do not need a car to get there.

So in general terms it is a good option to renew the wardrobe.

Es una tienda de ropa casual y moderna de buena calidad, donde encuentras gran variedad de estilos colores y tallas para la familia (con cuerpos de medianos a grandes xs, s, m, l, xl)

Sus precios son accesibles y ocasionalmente sus "especiales" (ofertas para quienes no son del norte de México) realmente son espectaculares pues puedes llegar a pagar solo el 30% del valor de la prenda.

Por otro lado se encuentra dentro del mall (plaza comercial) que esta a solo unos pasos del cruce fronterizo El Chaparral en Tijuana, por lo que no necesitas auto para llegar.

Así que en términos generales es una buena opción para renovar el guardarropa.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Beautiful elegant step-back in time in this lovely old home of the shipping magnate William Dollar Family. Open to the public. Saved from the wrecking ball by the Citizens of San Rafael many years ago - so that YOU could enjoy it today. Gorgeous grounds. Facilities to rent for weddings, art shows and events. (AND always keep an eye on this beautiful place, be aware and vigilant lest City officials AGAIN target this for "development.")<//Review>< Pictures>

We attended for a friend's wedding. The grounds for this facility are absolutely, stunningly beautiful! Great experience. My only complaint is that the bathrooms are too few/too small and the interior of the building is mostly a bit drab (think greying carpeting, only a few places to sit, which are mostly older couches, etc.)</Text>

<text>My best friend just got married here, and it was beautiful. I can't believe something so nice and nature-friendly could be so close to the city! The house is beautiful, and the gardens are so beautiful. There are deer and turkeys walking around, and I loved being here. The house is so cool, and it is like being sent back in time. I loved this spot. Such a beautiful place for a wedding<3<//text></record>

The room are clean & spacious, the bed was also extremely comfortable, yet my room was not made up once during my three day stay. Im not sure if this is a result of my room being at the end of the corridor but my towels were not changed. Other than that honestly no complaints other than the fact the fridge is completely empty, not even a complimentary water bottle.</Text>

<rate>4<//rate><text>I coordinated a wedding here and for the location, it's quite affordable since it's owned by the City of San Rafael. The art gallery is upstairs and during events, it's not generally open for guests -- too bad because it would be a great icebreaker during the reception.

The lawn is great for an intimate wedding ceremony and the house itself is perfect for a guest list of under 80. The couple seated just under 80 guests on the deck and strung market lights -- creating a lovely setting for dinner. The antique furniture and stained glass add to the appeal. Even the bathrooms made guests gasp -- they were so pretty!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The step back in time when you walk through the front door is amazing. Artistry every where, carved wood, stained glass, was a feast for the eyes. On the outdoor space you are greeted with scents coming from fragrant flowers old vines of climbing roses. A must see!</Review>< pics>

The Master Gardener demonstration gardens are spectacular! They have a moon garden, a pollinator friendly habitat (to encourage bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects to come), and Mediterranean garden with plants from Australia, South Africa, and other countries with similar "western facing" coastal climates (wet winter months followed by dry summer/ fall months). Plus the most fascinating and enormous succulents (check out the agave and aloe plants that have 15ft+ spire-like blooms!). Beautiful building and great place to wander around on a lazy day.< /Review>

<Review>A beautiful place, the grounds surrounding this huge Victorian Mansion are amazing. I like walk there, there is a greenhouse and many flowers to look at. The green grass surrounding this mansion feels great on your bare feet. If you never have been there Its worth a walk around. I am not sure when they have tours of the House, I went years ago.</Review><Name>Helene Wood< /Name><Response>None< /Response>< time>

A beautiful nook in downtown San Rafael. Master gardens and astroturf juxtapose the battle for parking and the seemingly random array of private events.</Text>

Place is rustic..old..kichen small if you plan to have yoyr wedding cater there..people working there have no clue seem like you are vitheringbthem if you ask them a question in the office..wss there for a wedding recently..lights were barely lighted inbthst garden area.....the poor workers trying to break down those horrible heavy table and old chairs..they could barely clean up and see..nkt very friendly or they check to see if you need anything...yoy have to bring your own lights if you want to see in that garden area....i would not use this venue unless you are desperate..it is least expensive than other venues...
..only best part is the outdoor patio  that looks decent..it is tight..old and staff is not much help ...< /review>

While the food is really good, and you get a decent amount of choices I could tell the pacing of service changes with who is  behind the counter. The two younger staff members were great till who ever the 3rd person was seemed to change the dynamic.  On the plus side yellow tail was awesome and the blazing Salmon was great. Albacore and the seaweed salad was also standout. Prices were a little high but with what they offered I was game to pay. Will try again if I am in the area.</Review>< Name>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Love poke places that use warm white rice. It just makes the poke taste that much better.

Tuna luau with the house spicy sauce is my go-to. Very clean, simple flavors of sesame oil, ponzu, and soy that works so well with the tuna and avocado. Sprinkle some furikake on top and you're solid.

They recently raised their prices so it's no longer the bargain it used to be. Still a good spot for a relaxing weekend lunch or a weekday dinner pick-me-up.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This place is nicely decor and clean.  This is very important especially when serving raw fishes.  Their poke bowl can be highly customize with quite a few different ingredients.  The fish selection is decent and they are fresh.  The yellow tuna, however, has a surcharge of $1.00 which in my opinion is not worth it due to the small scope they were given me.  The staffs were friendly.  The price is reasonable for dinner.  However, as for lunch, you might be only few dollars away from an average Japanese restaurant quality Chirashi Bowl.  It has a self serving soda fountain and utensil station.  Specialty drinks such as Thai-Tea, Guava Island juice and Tropical juice are also available.  There are plenty of parking space as well.  Recommended.< /review>

<Review>Service could be better. Portion size for the protein is fairly small for 3 scoops and pricey. Yellowtail is +$1 I do like that they have kelp noodles wished more poke places had this as a base option. Overall, I stopped by here cause it was the closest poke place in the area, however I’ll stick to my favorite places.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>The BEST poke I’ve ever had. I have ordered else where many times but this place does not compare to those. It was so delicious I cant keep talking about it.

<rate>1< /rate><review>Never going here again. My online order took an hour to have ready, i had to wait in the store while a dozen people who came in after me were helped before me. Cashier doesnt know basic math, my order was completely wrong. How hard is it to put fish in a bowl? Overpriced, bad selection. This place is a joke, just another chain trash poki place with low quality and worse service. No one was rude though, very polite staff; this is 100% management’s fault.</review>< Pictures>

First time here and I think I'm obsessed, they give you a nice portion and you can choose rice and salad, your 2 or 3 scoops sashimi of choice and toppings, it's a bargain. Definitely recommend it super fresh and there organic miso soup is delicious.<//Review>

Food was very fresh. The spring mix was crisp, no browning, edamame was superb. Salmon was large and chunky,  crab was very finely shredded! House sauce is sesame seed based. Brown rice was good but could've used less water at cooking. Overall great for my first try here, I ordered delivery on Postmates. Portions were exact.< /text>

<text>AhiPoki is one of the best poke places to get your poke on! Wide selection of sashimi, veggies, and extras to add on to a wonderful experience. Bowls and scoops big enough to keep the hunger down. There are different flavored sashimi like their new Blaze which is fire 🍣🔥🔥🔥!!! Try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. New location at Rialto Renaissance opening soon! (Closer to me!) 😍👏🤙😁< /text>< userid>

Great customer service!!!! If you've never been here and are kind of confused on how to order. The counter people are awesome!!!! I don't like salads.
However, the way they put the dish together is sooooo good. Brown rice, salad, choice of different raw fish. From non spicy to SIRACHA spicy.<//text>

<rating>2<//rating><text>The food is good often. Recently went there though and the fish they served was frozen.   Super gross experience.  The bigger issue though and the reason for the review is the one girl who consistently works there behind the counter.  I’ve waited to write this as I wanted to give it a few times, but every time I go in there, doesn’t matter if it’s completely dead/slow, she rushes you through the process almost as if she’s annoyed that you are there or that you don’t know the menu as well as she does.  Basic customer service: Slow your process just enough to genuinely interact with customers and not just shove items in their bowl that they aren’t even sure of because you are rushing them to complete the process.<//text>< gmapID>

It had a good variety of tuna, salmon and yellow tail fish to choose from. The spicy tuna was good. They had salad and rice to choose as a base of your poki bowl. The sauces could have been better to add to the bowl. Overall a good experience.<//Text>

The ambience is good, went around noon on a Thursday and the place was packed, their serve system is great, everything seemed to follow. I love Poke, it's practically sushi in a bowl (to me anyway), the taste was ok, the ginger seemed old and dry as you can tell in the photo, and this particular bowl was not as "fresh" as it should have been. This bowl consists of 3 "Meat" servings 2 Salmon and 1 Spicy Tuna (they had a Spicy Salmon Option that looked delicious) some seaweed salad, crab meat ontop of brown rice. It's a smaller portion bowl than I'm normally use to, however it's still good. Let's work on keeping the items tasting "Fresh".<//Text>

The food here is great quality and always tastes on point. My only real complaint is with the wait. For a place where food is already made and just needs to be put together, the wait is exceptionally long. Don't be fooled into thinking it will be a quick stop even if there are only one or two people in line. Everytime I have been here the wait is long. This said, the food is worth the wait. Best local poki spot by far.</review>

This is my favorite poke place in the area. I go here maybe once every two weeks. I usually go right after they open and the food is just newly laid out. I love that I can be in and out in 5-10 mins. I just wish that they bring back jalapenos and mangos. Their miso soup is also a bit bland.< /text>

Food is good but Price's are way too high for the amount of food you get. All locations are the same 😐<//review>

Love it. Go here all the time. It's like Chipotle, but for sushi related stuff. Mix your own sushi bowls .

Tuna Luau is great, so is blazing salmon. Haven't tried their unagi yet.

This place is a little on the expensive side. $9.75 for a regular bowl (2 scoops of fish) and $11.25 for 3 scoops. But it is really good, and really filling too.</Text>

<text>Love all the toppings, wish the fish portion was bigger though. Also not everything is listed on the menu above (some toppings, noodle base, spicy mayo, etc). It's a great place to bump into your boyfriend's ex's mother and sister as well for the first time since their breakup. 10/10 would come again to bump into the ex.< /text><name>Phoebe Van Buren</name><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c329ab3b2bc0cb:0xedabdfd6a2941fa8<//gmapID><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Like poke you got to give this place is chance the staff is always wonderful the place is always clean and the fish is always fresh I've been to some poke places where you walk in and you can smell the fish not a good sign let me tell you but this place has no fishy smell and The Taste is always to die for so if you're ever in West Covina Covina Walnut or any other City nearby make sure you give this place a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.</Review>

<time>1503437715956<//time><review>Best poke with the freshest sushi you can get around Covina. I would recommend getting the half and half because it's the better deal; it's awesome they even offer it and it's plenty enough to fill you up! (Make sure you get the eal sauce on the rice!!!) The atmosphere is very relaxed and the employees are super nice and willing to answer all the questions you may have!!<//review>< rate>

<review>It was OKAY. 10 for a regular and 11 for a large bowl. Steep prices, especially for college student like myself. The food quality is decent, but not worth the money. Also, the entire time I'm eating Disney soundtrack was blasting; loudly. Extremely annoying atmosphere because of this, haha. NOT worth it.< /review>< Pics>

<review>First of all, I'm so happy to have a poke bowl place closer than Chino Hills! I wanted to try this place out for lunch today and I wasn't disappointed. Even though it was my first time here, the workers were nice and helpful. Even suggested which sauces to try based on what I like, which was spicy mayo with sriracha and sweet citrus, soo good! I got the tuna luau, which is marinated tuna, with half brown rice and half organic salad, crab, seaweed, ginger, cucumber, edamame, and onion. They have quite a few other options as well. I'm very happy with this place and can't wait to go again!< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Food and flavor had me coming back regularly. Customer service however I find to be very rude. One man in particular the other day with a full beard, when I asked to get fresh yellowtail to avoid being served the last of the remaining two pieces of a pan. He refused, and said that to give me more yellowtail would require him to go cut more.

I think this place is very expensive, but flavorful. If the customer service was as good as the food I wouldn't mind coming back. It was a simple request and to have absolutely no effort on this managers part is a shame. I've told others about this incident and being in the hospitality industry myself, I know better, and this guy should too. Highly unlikely that you don't have pre-cut fish prepped during dinner rush, but maybe he didn't want to walk five feet. Never again.<//Review>

This place is my favorite poke spot. They have a lot of toppings and a good amount of choices of fish. The prices are very reasonable. The staff is always friendly. I always get the large bowl with white rice, garlic soy for the sauce, salmon, yellow tail, and tuna. Then the toppings I get seaweed, double crab, cucumber, edamame and salmonroe. Side note some of my friends get all the 9 sauces mixed together. Also extra crab is 75 cents, avocado is $1 and yellowtail is $1. It's sorta hard to find this place.When you get off the freeway at the IKEA go north towards the foothills and make a left at the 2nd light. It will be the on the right when you enter the parking lot. I've been all over the planet and this is my favorite poke spot...for real. I hope you enjoy it.<//text>

This has to be the worst experience I have ever had with a dental office. I have had temporaries on since October and have had to go in multiple times to get them glued back on. I’ve spent $4000 on my dental care and still have not received a phone call or email to get my permanents. Last night one of the temporaries cracked for the 4th time and this time there is bleeding and severe pain and when I called this morning at 9 am when they opened all they could say is that there is not a doctor in the office today. I had to ask if it was possible to go to a different location because I am in a lot of pain and the receptionist said she had to ask her supervisor. She then tells me to call Felicita (didn’t even offer to transfer me) which I did and they said they were completely booked but that she could see that San Marcos had openings and she would transfer me. I am on hold with San Marcos who clearly has openings but says they cannot see me because I am not one of their patients so to call the Escondido location for service! This is ridiculous spending this much time calling different locations when I have spent a large amount of money at this place and still have not been treated with any good service! But they are surely on top of having their financial department call me to collect $400 on the work that has still not been finished! My tooth is still bleeding but I guess it’s my problem. I will 100% be switching dentists once my work is complete!< /Text>

I cracked my molar tooth and needed to be seen right away. They fit me in at this Escondido location even though I live in Rancho San Diego. I'm very thankful that they accommodated me in or I would had had a painful , terrible 3 day weekend.
I will admit I was so scared and had sooo much anxiety about the procedure.
The welcoming front desk, the very polite x-ray technician , caring dental assistant and  very professional Dentist , Dr Mehta,  I automatically felt at ease and well taken care of through it all.
They explained everything clearly and we're very sweet to me through it all when it came to the tough part. Thank you all once again. .</Text>

My dentist is the best Dr. Shawn Chadha was patient, understand, and does really good work. He has a great since of humor and I am happy my last dentist quit taking my insurance, other wise I would never found this place. The best part about this doctor I feel he is very straight to the point in telling you what you need done and what to expect worse come to worse.<//Review>

<text>Went in for a deep cleaning because supposedly I had periodontal disease. They did the left side first and the right side would be treated 2 days later. 24 hours after having a deep cleaning on my left side, one of my tooth was profusely bleeding from the gums. I went in the next day to let them know and the dentist was clueless why this was happening. First they wanted to extract another tooth because supposedly it was infected, then they suggested that I might have a blood disorder. They also tried to stop the bleeding with me bitting down on some tea bags. When nothing worked they recommended I go to the ER to get some blood tests. After sitting there for more than an hour and the dentist basically guessing on what to do I decided to go to urgent care. I had blood test done there which all came out normal and the doctor suggested to go to see another dentist immediately for a second opinion. Finally decided to see a new dentist the same day who a family member recommended. The new dentist was horrified with what he saw. He said that my gum fibers and tissue were damaged from the deep cleansing. He applied a brown paste on my gums and teeth to stop the bleeding within a few minutes. He also prescribed penicillin to prevent infection for the next 7 days. My new dentist basically said that the first dentist was treating me for periodontal disease when I should have been treated for gingivitis. This was a really bad experience. I couldn’t eat solid foods for almost a whole week which resulted in me losing weight. I was unable to go to work for a couple days because of the bleeding and pain. To make matters worst they charged my insurance and I for this poorly dental job done. If I could give this place a zero I would.< /text><Rating>1< /Rating><pics>None<//pics><date>1570223811455<//date><Resp>{'time': 1570485803971, 'text': "Hi Angelica,\n\nThank you for taking the time to write a review.

I had a dental emergency . My dentist didn’t feel my issue was an emergency so I called around. I found this dentist at bright now dental. I got in the same day . The care and Covid 19 precautions were exceptional. My dentist made me feel so calm and was very caring and gentle . The assistant was so sweet too. My 4 hour dental appt left me exhausted and crying and very angry at my old dentist. The dr and assistant made this horrible dental emergency as good as it could be . I loved them so much I fired my old dentist and will come to them from now on.<//Text>

I am already an anxious patient and the front office gal Cammie is amazing and has great customer service, makes me feel safe. The Dr. has a great chair side manner and works efficiently with showing care for his patients. The assistant (has a slight foreign accent) made me so nervous, she was constantly out of her seat during the procedure and at a time when she should’ve been using the suction hose to get water out of my throat (I had nitrogen for my anxiety so has to breath through my nose)she left and I have to swallow and hit the Dr.s drill and now I have a cut under my tongue that hurts like crazy and didn’t sleep much due to the pain. I will continue to go back as I love this place but I will not allow her to work on me ever again.< /review>

SO NICE & KIND.  They were direct and informative...  Yet very patient and understanding.  WE LOVE coming to this Dental Office.  They take the time to make sure we're cared for, understand our plan for dental health, and provide us every option/opportunity to help meet our needs.  WE CAN'T BE HAPPIER.<//review>

Everyone is very nice but I went for a filling turns out I didn't need one. One dentist said another thing and it was the wrong tooth. It turned out I needed now a Crown on my upper tooth #13 when the first dentist said he could do a filling. Makes me think if I should take my business elsewhere. I am going every 3 months for my cleanings and updating my Dental plan for the upcoming year and it should be better but I want a dentist where everyone on the same page and they listen to their patients. Not feeling Bright Dental anymore. Will get a 2nd opinion if I can get a regular filling on number 13th when the first Dentist was going to do it but this Dentist insisted on a Crown.<//review>

<text>They are very affordable and do a good job. I don't have dental insurance but they offer their own dental plan which gives you major discounts and sometimes they will even work with you on the price. The office is clean and well maintained. The hygienist is very nice and friendly. She did a great job cleaning my teeth with minimal pain. I've been going back for a couple of years now.  Sometimes my appointment has been cancelled or I've had a long wait, but I understand that there can be scheduling issues.< /text>< rate>

<text>I went in for a single chipped tooth. I ended up being told I needed three crowns. Dr. Loff insisted that I needed the expensive ones for durability.  It took them a very long time, six months,  to get them done because one of them never got ordered and twice they messed up the molds and the crown didnt fit. Dr Loff was very rude to his staff and then started becoming increasingly rude to me. So much so that I literally left in tears  and pain once and refuse to go back for further treatment because he sawed into my temp crown wurh ZERO numbing medication and was so sadistic and mean. My husband was with me and said hey are you doing that without numbing it? He flung his chair back and stormed off. He came back and jabbed me so hard in multiple places with such force I had pain for 6 weeks after and it got infection. The thing was he had such anger when he did it too! Also, two of the three crowns have chipped and I am now in debt up to my ears with them and have two jagged crowns cutting my mouth and can't get them fixed even though I have 3000 in debt with them.  I HIGHLY recommend if you must use Bright Now dental you choose another location! Run from Dr. Loff.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I’d give Bright Now 0 stars if I could.
They wanted to perform unnecessary bone grafts following wisdom teeth extraction on my 17 year old son. I believe this protocol is harmful and is an expensive charge for an unnecessary procedure. Stay away from Bright Now!</text>

<text>I came in thinking my experience was going to be like the first time(which wasn't pleasant) i was kind of nervous about it because i knew I wasn't in a good place with my teeth. but there is a new staff that's there i think. Very good at multi tasking, kept it real which i needed. And made the process fast and easy. Maricruz i think thats her name the dental hygienist was great! Ask for her she does a great job. There were some moments when the dental nurse (she's the best with doing xrays) put some pressure on my mouth at times which made me uncomfortable but it was my fault because i didn't say anything which led me to move. The dentest Dr. Shawn Chadna (which i suggest he's great)  did give me some good advice and told me if that happens again just to raise my left arm and that will let them know to stop. So there you go. Great team even though it did look like there was a call out or a shortage of hours they did great and worked well together. Thanks guys!< /text>< resp>

Poor dental care, stay away!  I went in for a cleaning, exam and x-rays and they lied to me, telling me that I better get all of this dental work done because I had big problems in my mouth that would get worse.  I knew that I have no problems in my mouth and the cleaning was the worst cleaning I have ever received.  Bright Now Dental are amateurs who are not very good at dentistry but are very good at trying to sell people expensive dental work that they do not need.  They apparently only hire dentist and  hygienists who are willing to defraud patients.  This company is a scam.  I realized it but many people probably do not.  Be careful!  How are places like this even allowed to operate in our city?  It seems criminal.  Beware.<//text>

< Review>
Very kind, caring, and funny Indian doctor who explained everything she was going to do (I was terrified), and actually was able to make me laugh while my mouth was being drilled.  HOWEVER...  the staff was very sub-par.  Exorbitant fees, way overpriced.  They don't answer questions properly, only vague answers that don't help at all.  They are not respectful of your time.  I usually had to wait about 15-20 min. but last time it was 45+ min, then I walked out.  They NEVER answer the phone, even the direct line.  I was ALWAYS transferred to the emergency line, and when I pointed this out, the person only said "Well, I'm not sure how that could be," in a very vague tone of voice.< /Review>

<Review>UPDATE JULY 23 2019
Since June 26 it's been a battle to get a set of retainers that fit. Today, July 23rd was suppose to be the day I get a replacement but lo and behold, they're not ready. 8 weeks after getting the initial impression done for my first set, and 3 weeks after the second impression and I still do not have retainers that fit. Save yourself the trouble and go to a private office. Bright Now is the worst franchise I've ever had the mispleasure of dealing with.

This review is going to be all over the place, as I've two years of complaints.

Bright Now Dental was okay for a while. Until I became aware that their Orthodontal staff is overworked and spread much too thin. They are visibly tired and this affects their work severely. I expect a dentist to be just as excited about getting back to a healthier smile as I am. I always feel rushed when I go in there and I feel like a stranger almost every time. In the 2 + years that I've been going, my general dentist and orthodontist have changed 3 times EACH. My most recent visit I dealt with a Dr. Franco and I did not like her one bit. She was cold and offered no insight to what I can do to improve my oral hygiene. She asked me once if I had any concerns, but did not seem too interested whether or not I actually had any. On my xray, there is visible bone loss on my upper right side that she never addressed or mentioned. And my lower gumline is in desperate need of attention due to severe gum recession from braces and years of crowding. BUT THIS WAS NEVER MENTIONED. After she cleaned my teeth, she walked off without thanking me for coming in and asking me if I had any questions. Every dentist I've ever been too ALWAYS thanks the patient after they are done treatment and ask if they need anything else. If Franco's your dentist, or you're thinking about making her your's, I would reconsider.
Additionally, I've had 2 appointments in the last year cancelled with no notice from the dental staff. I've shown up for my appointment only to be told the person in charge of the instruments had an emergency and another, more recent appointment on June 8, where I showed up 10 minutes before my time, only to be met with locked doors and no staff. They claimed to have called me and left several voice mails, but I never recieved a call from them. I told the receptionist, Jenna I think was her name, that I'm fed up with the service I have been recieving from their clinic and that I'll be finding a new one. She said, "That's fine" This is a very good way to run a business. Tell your customers that it's fine if they take their business elsewhere and don't address the problems at hand.
During my last appointment, a man was in the waiting room filling out paperwork to be seen. I imagine he was on a lunch break, as he was smartly dressed. He finished his stack of paperwork and took it to Jenna, (I think that was her name. She's new to me.) the receptionist, only to be told he had MORE to fill out. He reacted very aggressively, swearing and being generally unkind. He then left, only for the receptionists and 1 other waiting room patient to begin bad mouthing him. I don't care how rude someone is to you, you do not talk ill of a patient in front of other patients. It's grossly unprofessional. This office, in Escondido Promenade is in need of some serious customer service training and they need to realize that we are people, not dollar signs.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had an emergency appointment today at Bright Now Dental and I was treated so well. I never have been seen there before. I was in pain with what turned out to be an absess and this Dental Office immediately helped me.
I didn't have to wait long to get the emergency appointment. On the phone and then off to the dentist. It was that fast! And I desperately needed it to be that fast as I have serious commitments tomorrow through Sunday.
Once there, I was received by an amazing office staff, very efficient and the office was extremely clean and modern.
I've honestly never seen an X-ray machine like theirs. Very high tech.
Got in very fast and efficiently.
Wonderful dentist came in unfortunately he had laryngitis and had to whisper and I don't hear very well so the dental assistant spoke on his behalf.
Turned out I had an abscess under my crown.
I was told to see a specialist so I went to their other location in San Marcos who has a endodontis there.
I’m editing now so anyone who goes to Bright Now can avoid the San Marcos location!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Ok, so I originally left a review in 2016 when I 1st took my kids in. The staff was great. Friendly, helpful and most importantly, KNOWLEDGEABLE. The Dr’s are still good ones, doing their jobs to the best of their abilities (they can only do so much with your teenage kids teeth/mouth in the office. Not like they can force them to brush and floss every meal). What I believe to be the problem here is, the front desk staff. Constantly changing, not always knowing what or how to do the paperwork. You make a payment with the finance office then go into an appointment and they try to charge you again because they don’t know the system so all they see is that you owe money, not that you’ve made payment arrangements with finance. It’s annoying. Another thing, appointments are really easy to schedule at the beginning but good luck going into your monthly ortho exam/rubberband change. Because it’s difficult to get your monthly scheduled, it prolongs the time they told the insurance it would take, making you pay additional fees. My advice, DO NOT come here for orthodontics.</Text>< pictures>

There is a new head dentist at this location, she's a female,  and she's fantastic. I have 8 cavities that were missed by my previous dentist and Dr. Rebecca Lang caught them all right before they turned into root canals. Not only did she do excellent  work on the repair,  but the office manager set up financing for me to help with  the large expense up front. The one thing and for me the most important  was that I did not feel any of the needles she had to use. She uses a trick that is great for those weary of them. Very talented dentist, and a great staff to help. When you can still write a great review while your jaw is in throbbing pain, you know you can trust my 5 stars.</text>

<review>This a review for the location in Escondido on Felicita.  I had a friend that went to this location who had the same kind of experience I had.
One of the worst dental experiences I've had in my life.  I have insurance through my work but wasn't enough to cover all their extra fees and services they tell you that you need.  Once they tell you how much it will cost they then offer you to apply for the Care Credit to cover their fees.  Once they find out you qualify for a certain amount they start with you need a deep cleaning which insurances don't cover, oh you also need antibiotics.  Your insurance doesn't cover it so it's $100 a pill, but since you're a customer we will do it for $50 a pill so it will only be a $100, don't worry if you don't have the money just use your Care Credit.  The whole experience reminds me when you bring your car in for something and they come back saying you need this, this and this.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>After a year, it seemed like every time I went in, there were always "additional charges".  Then the time I showed up to a locked office, and a phone call after my appointment time to cancel my appointment was very unprofessional.

Today, I had made an appointment to look at and treat a old filled tooth that had cracked off.  When I showed up for my 8am appointment,  they couldn't find my appointment.   When I pressed to be seen anyway, "I'm only the periodontist" was the excuse I recieved.

No organization. No one except the office manager can do anything.  And a continual turn  over of staff, except the office manager.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>if i could i would only rate this 4.5 stars, since i had to wait a little longer than usual to get into the appointment, but realize that the only reason for that is that they are so thorough with the procedures that it may take longer than expected. they have a nice lobby area with a tv with the game show network on, so time went by fast. love the new technology of the xrays, and they even take pictures of your actual teeth. the hygienist did a great job, my teeth never felt so clean. no cavities, yay! they were also really helpful with payments. it was a little drive away from where i live, but definitely worth it.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
It's nice to go to an office with familiar faces, where the staff knows you by name and vice versa. My family and I are always treated with professionalism each and every visit from Luis Fajardo, Erma the Ortho Tech, & the ladies at the front desk. I left my dentist (private practice) of over 10 yrs for a location closer to home-- Luis Fajardo, the Office Manager, made a very hard decision, easy to make. I would have given 5 stars, but because Luis is no longer with the company, therefore I rated them with only 4 stars.<//Review>

<review>Bright Now Dental is a place I highly reccomend, I first heard about them through my dad and was nervous. But, the orthadonist team made me feel welcome with a calming enviorment for the clients. For example, starting conversations and constantly checking if the we need of their assistance.

<text>If i could give this place a zero i would. My wife and i had high hopes with this dental scam location. We started going to bright now dental in escondido next to panera about 4 years ago. Let me start off by telling everybody that its obvious this place is doing some form of marketing technique in the last week there have been about 5 reviews simple and basic. Maybe the company decided to switch from yelp (since their ratings suck there) to try to fool every one on google. When we started going to that dental office there was a female manager then a male manager then a hispanic manager now we go in and their is a female manager (turn over is too high). Started off with a middle eastern dentist (can remember her name) she was horrible and very rude. Then a petite Dr came in i believe her name was Dr. Lana or something like that she was great one of the reasons we kept going now they have another middle eastern Dentist. Believe her name is Dr. M  extremely rude condescending and slow. Longest 2 hours of my life for what she said was "a quick small filling". We've met 3 diff cleaning ladies 2 of them were great but the new one there, Danielle is all about upsale, upsale, upsale. Makes me wonder if they have a quota to meet. The new manager doesn't seem to know what shes doing, the front staff girls are always on there phone dressed unprofessionally and talking about their own personal life. Long story short this company really needs to learn how to keep staff and hire good experienced dentists. Not new dentist that are fresh out of school. Will be taking my insurance and business elsewhere. Where we don't feel like a number sign.< /text><username>Tom Henderson</username><date>1481740426550< /date><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>Awful experience. I was on my lunch break and went in to get a chipped tooth fixed. they were more than a half hour late to call me into the room. Once I got called back they did x-rays and sat me in another room for another 20 minutes. when the doctor finally came in i told her what i was there for and asked for pricing before she did the procedure. she said she would send in the office manager to discuss it. i sat there for another 30 mins and finally just got up to walk out to go back to work. i recieved a call about 15 mins after that asking where i had gone. i explained to him i was there for an hour and a half and got nothing accomplished and i needed to get back to work. he was apologetic but it didnt fix anything it was unacceptable. then 3 weeks later i got a bill for a "comprehensive oral exam" which nothing about the exam was comprehensive. im not even sure you can call it an exam. very poor time management i will not be returning and do not reccoment this place< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Let me start off with I've had two fingers cut off with a band saw at a young age
But the pain of the needle going into my jaw was the most painful feeling ever this was not my first wisdom tooth pulled and my last surgery made me feel like saying hey let's do this again another time and that was a mom and pops shop

A female doctor with a broken leg performed my surgery she struggled so bad to pull my wisdom tooth first she was so brute to shove the needle in my mouth so hard I started shaking from the pain instantly after that they gave me a few minutes for the stuff to kick in they came back they put a block in my mouth to bite on but while she was sitting trying to pull on my tooth she starts to wiggle my jaw to the point it felt like it was going to break off I had to tell her you are hurting me instead of pulling more she instead uses my jaw bone as leverage to break chunks of tooth off instead i felt she did not have the proper body mechanics to position her strength correctly she was sitting and hanging on my jaw this
rookie work felt like i was at barber college style dental group I assumed instantly that she was in training anyways it's been almost a yr now my jaw side has spasms and a lump In my jaw bone that comes and goes where the tooth was pulled
I have never felt that way in my life I will never go back< /review>

<text>This place often is so hit or miss with me. All my friends love this place but I never understood the appreciation for this place. Beer selection is definitely great but the bartender can be great some nights and completely lousy other times. They also got rid of the jukebox last time I went in. I rather go to another dive.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I think the phrase that got me was "I have known you for three years but only 3 weeks." Want to have a civil discussion about anything other than politics and religion? This is your place because the regulars make the bar. Oh, and know how to play steel darts, it is a bar.</Text>

Awesome tap selection. Cool crowd, cool, knowledgeable staff. Only reason Crazy Harry's gets four stars is because it was barely wide enough to walk into without turning sideways. As craft beer gets more popular, it gets harder to squeeze in on a weekend night. This is a pilgrimage spot, though, if you are a craft head like me.<//text>

Awesome beer in the west valley! That's right- the WEST valley.

Excellent choice of craft beer. Super cool vibe, beer snob approved! And I got some bling.

Great place to meet up with friends. Super friendly staff.</Text>

Went here because they had Lagunitas' Waldos Special on tap. It's a beer Lagunitas only releases once a year around 4-20. Small dive bar with a dart board. They keep their untapped menu up to date. Bartender is chill. Good job, good beer, good place.<//Review>

The food was so bad. I ended up going to Taco Bell. I ordered the taquitos. They were burnt and the meat was burnt. I would not serve customers the food they made us. The beans tasted oily and no flavor. We waited 40 mins to get a burrito and 3 taquitos. If they reach out. Don’t even offer me free food. It’s not even worth it. I don’t eat out often and when I spend $40 on food. At least be decent. I’m more upset that whoever made the food thought this was ok to serve.</text>

I’m not sure what happened but this is DEFINITELY not the same restaurant. They basically KNEW that their fridge broke and they’re sending food out this way. The two salsas I got were so RANCID they burned my tongue. There was also a hair inside my food. This is disgusting to say the least. They felt bad and asked for forgiveness and free food but I threw it all away because I don’t want to get sick. The burrito was dripping so much oil it soaked the container. I am not a Complainer, but I do believe in getting quality food when paying this much money. $29 I spent through DoorDash and I only got back $22. I cannot give them another chance because anyone who is willingly serving rancid food on purpose just because times are tough don’t deserve my loyalty. I’m done with this restaurant for good. 🤢🤢🤢 I better not get sick!!!!!!</review>

Something has changed here, but times are tough. The last time I ordered nachos, the cheese had burnt to the styrofoam tray so when I picked up the chip the whole tray came with it. I can’t imagine what kind of toxins were released as the nachos are microwaved. Overall, tasty but you begin to question the quality.

Kudos to the other review calling out the microwaved food note—it’s true, that thing gets used quite a bit. At least they’re transparent, who knows what goes on behind most closed-door kitchens. You’d be surprised how many sit down places are using a microwave, too!<//text>

From being one of my favorite places to pick up and deliver; it changed so drastically on the service. I just don't feel comfortable delivering for them. I truly don't believe the food quality is any good because of the time they're spending assembling items and by the time they bag the food; it's probably already cold...< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

If you are curious about this restaurant, please do not waste your time or money. It was soooooo bad. We went there on a Saturday night, no line. I should go have known right there.. we ordered taquitos and a 32 oz michelada for myself and my husband. Bad idea. it was dripping, DRIPPING with Tapitito and Tahini.  It took about 30 napkins just to make sure it would not slip between my fingers. And the taquitos, well not really sure what meat they used. Not crispy, not delicious. Its obvious the cook and the server did not enjoy their work..they looked like they wanted to be anywhere but there. It was so obvious.< /text>

<Review>I have eaten one to many times just because I  think their Chilaquiles are pretty good but I've tried, and tried other stuff and 🤮 NOT worth the price AT ALL! I'm the biggest foody, and tryer, and have tasted a zillion Mex. Places. This is not a recommendation I would ever give. On top of that, WORST horchata ever made here! It's not the name, it's the lack of direction this Tapatio took or has, cause other Tapatio places 🤤🤤🤤 Cust. Serv. also...BAD! Just dont tell me I didnt warn you! 🙊</Review></record></dataset><record>

I wanted to give this place another chance despite my coworker warning me of the poor customer service, but this last experience made me not want to give them my business anymore. This is the second or third time I've gone by and they were closed when they were supposed to be open. I ordered a veggie burrito and I asked the employee what was in it; she didn't name lettuce as one of the ingredients so I asked if there was lettuce in the veggie burrito and she said yes. When I looked at my receipt she had charged me $1 extra for lettuce..in a veggie burrito..which I didn't ask for extra. Anyway, I'm waiting for my burrito and there's only one guy prepping the food and it seems to be taking longer than usual because he was chatting with two guys. He did apologize for taking so long which I appreciated. The cherry on top though was that halfway through my burrito I felt/tasted something off in a bite and there was a piece of carne asada in my veggie burrito. Hopefully this review will make them want to do better for future customers.<//text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>As the name of this restaurant implies, there are other Taqueria El Tapatio restaurants in our area. I strongly recommend avoiding this location and visiting one of their other locations if in the mood for Mexican food. You will receive better customer service overall and the quality of the food will be significantly better.

Because I don't believe in ruling a place out based on one bad food experience, I have tried this place multiple times since it opened at The Annex. Unfortunately, this week I cannot deny that the food here is of poor quality and lacks flavor. The salsas and guacamole provided lacked flavor. The tortillas were stale. Part of the food is microwaved (which I'm not against, most of us use a microwave to reheat food, but it did not make the food better in any way). All food was bland. The aguas frescas were passable. Essentially, there was no passion and pride in the making of the food.

A relative ordered a plate which comes with sides and ordered extra tortillas. When we received our order, there were no sides for his plate or extra tortillas. He waited in line instead of cutting in front of anyone and asked about his missing items. The cook immediately got defensive and claimed we never ordered them. Thankfully, the cashier pulled up the receipt without us asking and showed the cook. It goes without saying the order was reluctantly rectified.

Also, another cook which may also be the location's manager, admitted to having the ingredients to make one of the menu items but just didn't feel like making it. This was not a big deal because we obviously still ordered food, but it serves as another example of the service one may experience.

What allows me to give this place 3 stars instead of 2 is the young lady who was the cashier. She was attentive, prompt, and courteous.</Review>< Pictures>

Thank you so much to Gabe and Juan for such awesome service! They made sure we were taken care of from the minute we placed our order until we walked out with our to-go box! These guys really made our experience delightful which we were not expecting at all especially while grabbing a quick bite!
Thank you again!< /text>

Good food just under staff at the moment, 2 people helping 10-15 customer's at the same time that's why 4 star review, while one cooks and socializing with friends & Poor girl trying to help get orders out.<//text>

If u want good ceviche NEVER get it from here. Ordered on doordash and this has to be the most disgusting ceviche I have ever had. It has a processed fish taste and feel to it. And no taste whatsoever.  Couldn't even eat it at all. Ceviche is my favorite food but this ruined it for me.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This place is absolutely disgusting. Not only did I find hair in my food, I could’ve swore I found what was a dead roach in my burrito. I went to complain and get a refund but not even could I get my money back due to the “manager not being there”. The cashier guy gave tremendous amounts of attitude and I left without having my food being re-made or my money back. Not only is the food just revolting, their horchata isn’t even half decent. Tastes like water. I bet they don’t even properly wash their utensils. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!< /text>< pics>

I ordered carne asada fries to share with friends and it was slices of potato, not fries. Ever time I come I'm disappointed because the food is not amazing and the service is okay. The original restaurant is much better.<//Text>

<Text>So, this place seems to have turned around. Looks like they changed the staff and thier pricing to finally be acceptable. The food has improved quite a bit since they first opened, and until recently, the only real issue I had was the price.

5 solid tacos for $5 at certain times of the day. I'm happy to say that I'm willing to swing by and grab some tacos now.

Original: The food is passable, but when you are in this area, there are many better alternatives literally 2 minutes down the street.

when there are more taco places around town than Subways, McDonalds, and Starbucks combined 4 fold, you really need to stand out, especially to justify the prices they have.

it is a passable bog standard taco stand that is pricey. thats all there is to it unfortunately< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Street tacos special on Tuesdays (3 Street tacos for $6.00) is not worth it. You only have one  choice of meat and tacos don't have enough meat. Recommend driving to the one on Ventura Rd. Where you can purchase each taco individually and save 70 cents on each taco ...oh and have the choice of meat you want. Also, bad customer service from the girl taking orders...< /text>

The food is passable but just that, passable. Not praise worthy as this food is lacking in flavor... "A esta comida le falta sazón!". I'll still visit when I'm craving tacos and I'm at The Collection, so I'll update this review if the food improves.<//Review>

< Review>
Came here on a whim to have hot soup on a rainy chilly day. Found the best Pho in town, well located in a shopping plaza  but a bit hidden on far end. The list of Menu is plentiful, all healthy options. The fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce was sumptuous and the beef stew Pho was perfect choice for a hungry stomach on a cold rainy day. The prices on the Menu are just right. The restaurant was not busy on an afternoon after 2 p.m but this place gets crowded at lunch time and dinner time. This place is big though and clean. Staffs are friendly and attentive. I would certainly come back to try the other foods on the menu!q< /Review>

<review>Had the Bún Bò Huê Special. All the condiments on this dish were great. The spice for me was good. Dont plan on getting appetizer if you are getting a large bowl. It will fill you up completely. I recommend this dish.<//review><Response>None</Response>< username>

Very good service! Clean environment. Good Pho. Reason for it being 4/5 stars is because there is a $20 minimum card use. This is annoying because I usually don't carry cash and I go here alone and spend less than that. Would recommend the owners to change it to $10 minimum.</Review>

Comfort food! I feel very lucky to have found this place. I had the seafood pho which, was fantastic. The staff is super friendly and the owner is so sweet and personable. She helped check us out. It was a wonderful experience and great food. Can’t wait to head back to try the Spicy Beef Soup.< /text>

My girlfriend ordered two orders of pho for a door dash order. After preparing the soup and started eating, I pulled out a long piece of plastic out of my mouth. (see attached photo) they also lied to her and did not provide any extra sauce after she called and made sure they saw the note. Never again</review>

Had my football party and phoned in for a tray of wings and egg rolls, couldn't of been happier with how it all tasted. The wings were dry and crispy, served with sweet chili sauce for dipping. The eggrolls maybe the best in town, they were gone first.</review>

Awesome hole in the wall place. A great place for families or people coming for some authentic Pho. Huge portions - the large can be split between two! I had the large chicken broth Pho. Adding the Chile sauce inside was the icing on the cake. I’m not a fan of spicy foods, but just the right amount hit the flavor spot! Good find, will come back again.<//Review>

<text>I wanted BBH (spicy beef noodle soup) outside of San Jose. This doesn't seem to be consistent with flavor and taste. The streamed pork is so thin like paper. I usually skip the pork blood but this time I didn't bone meat. What happened after was not good. Got stomach issues. This place is not as clean as when it opened.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Date>1570253389567<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Not worth the money. It came with 3 slices of meat and the broth tasted like a basic beef broth. I should of known better based on location. I definitely will not be returning.<//review>

This place is a rare gem. The food is always superb! The coffee is delicious and the staff is exceptionally friendly. It is a small location but it is kept clean and it isn't usually very busy. I highly recommend coming here for lunch if you work close by especially when it is colder. The soup warms up every inch of your body from your head to your toes! Superb restaurant and beautiful food!</Text>

The best pho place in the tri-valley. Consistent quality and the owner is super friendly. If you're looking for some good Vietnamese food you won't be disappointed.<//review>

It's good. The Thai tea is good, but the pearls weren't done well and it didn't taste good with them. The pho nothing special, taste the same...< /Review>

<review>This is our new favorite local  Pho spot!

The food. For the appetizer, we ordered the spring rolls. Entrees, we ordered the grilled pork with rice and one over easy egg, a #8 pho bowl, and egg noodle soup with wonton. No complaints! And my 8 year old daughter is hard to please, even with a simple bowl of soup. But she left full and 100% satisfied.

This spot won me over the moment I saw they have hot chili OIL. I don't know why all restaurants can't have this! It is a necessity with all Asian foods lol.

Customer service was good. All the staff seemed really nice. Food came out quick. And the waiter was kind enough to check on us more than enough times to make sure we were ok, which doesn't happen everywhere.

The one thing I did not check out was the bathroom. Will see next time but I hope it's clean!

I am not sure how long this place has been around, but we have not been able to find a good Pho spot near home since we have been living here (10 years). This is our new go-to when we are craving Pho!<//review>< user_id>

When we got here, it seem as if it was going to get busy. We entered the place. Got seated and quickly ordered. 5 mins has passed, we were like, "okay, it's a pretty busy place people started to come in." 10 mins later we were like, " this place gets busy.(seeing a family of 8 come in). So we waited. Since our 8 month old son was with us, he kept us busy. Then after about over 45 mins, I looked around me and seen everyone one else with their food. Especially, the family of 8. I had to say something. I then proceed to go to the cashier and let her know my situation. Then as soon as I got back to my seat, 5 mins later, I got my food.  After getting my food, I went up to pay. The lady remembered me and gave me a 10% discount for the wait and invited me back
Overall, what was meaning to be a low score review. I ended up giving this a 5 star for being grateful for being able to eat great food from welcoming people.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>5</rating><user>106584097683310638451</user><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<review>I ordered pho and fish cakes. Meat and basil quality is ok. Bean sprout is really really white. The lettuce next to the fish cake is slightly bitter and fish cake is kind of tough. Not a place I would comeback.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I have been to Pho99 3 times since it has opened last week. The food is very fresh and tasty. The Seafood Pho was the best. I am not a coffee drinker but I had a Vietnamese Ice Coffee for the first time which was incredible. On the second visit I had a Vietnamese salad which was yummy, I am going to try the Beef Stew on my next visit.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Best apple fritters I have ever had. I was skeptical since it wasn't much from the outside, but they have the best donuts I have found in the area. Of course, like all donut places, they are best fresh, so if you want to make sure your donut is fresh go in the morning (actual early morning, not 11 am). I haven't ever tried anything besides the donuts, so this 5 Star review does not include any other food or drink items, just the donuts.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808e31edf0423541:0x62714e4ba5194ce< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>My wife and I had our wedding reception in October 2017 and went to all the known donut shops in the San Jose area to find the right donut. Yum Yum was our preference because their dough was more flavorful, consistent, and less greasy. They also had two unique flavors for Halloween that were lime and orange; sounds odd, but they worked really well. Yum Yum made 120 plus donuts to accommodate us. They were made the day of and everyone loved the idea, taste, and flavor options. Rose Café had the big donut for our top tier(little dry), but everything below was the highly complemented product of Yum Yum. Having moved out of state, we would advise you visit this classic strip mall shop to see the flavor du mois(they seem to change month by month) and support these friendly, caring, and creative people. Please tip a dollar more than you think is necessary because they deserve it.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHHBQ0Bn6AaM2Vy7J0yStcXavwArZhbyl7GLFO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>If you are feeling for donuts and are on blossom hill, I highly recommend this California local donut store. They have your standard donuts, coffee, bagels, but even also have special types of bagels like pizza bagels. The Blossom Hill and Snell plazas may look a little grungy but do not let the appearance of those parking lots be the judge for the quality of its restaurants.</Review>< name>

They have bear claws and other kinds that look delicious too. We’ve also had their breakfast bagels- the scorched garlic (I believe) has great flavor- not too garlicky! Kind customer service and fresh donuts - can’t beat that! Plus, my toddler LOVES them:)<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I've been here several times and I love their food. But their services have not alwasy been consistent. They are times they greet you with a smile but lately they are rude. It might be due to individuals mood but they should be consistent in their service. Overall, it is not really that bad and everything in their menu are delicious.< /Text>< Rating>

We love this place. Always quiet and fast service.  The kids love the "Blue" donuts... blue is a rarity in the donut world apparently. 😂</Review>

Horrible..the cashier couldn't read English so I ended up having to RING UP MY OWN ORDER of a dozen bagels, they had NO lids for the cream cheese tubs, only one flavor of cream cheese, and only had enough cream cheese to fill half the bin but still got charged for a full 4oz.. Never week go there again!< /Text>

< Review>
This place should be the last resort if you are looking for good fresh donuts. The donuts are heavy and stale. The service is terrible, they advertise a new Blueberry donut and I asked the guy there if they have any and his response is I was tired this morning and didn't feel like making them, I have heard that more than once there. Go to Sam's at Snell and Santa Teresa at least the donuts are fresh and the employees treat the customers well.< /Review>

<Text>Known around here as the neighborhood shop with a heart.A throwback to the days where service meant you were treated special.Each customers is greeted with a smile.The coffee is is amazing,the doughnuts fresh out of the fryer and the privacy and unobtrusiveness this place offers is almost non existent anymore.Wether you order and run or sit for an hour engaged in conversation with a new found friend,at yum yums it's your choice.Not like in some corporate places where only the dollar signs matter.To every worker at our quaint little neighborhood shop we thank you all for your hard work and being such an asset to our community.I only wish more businesses would be so in touch with their neighborhood.Ive been coming here for 7 years,often 3 times a day.So check it out,sit a spell and enjoy the great java.You ll be glad you did.Thank you for being such an amazing example of what a neighborhood business should be like.zBravo bravo bravo< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Average selection, average quality.
Many of the donuts are sold out early on weekends.
Service is somewhat lacking.<//Text>

5 STARS!! We had a fantastic first-time home buying experience with Trillion Real Estate!! Gloria Escamilla was our realtor and she was phenomenal. Not only did Gloria educate us, she was extremely responsive, professional, patient, genuine and kind. Trillion Real Estate team work so efficiently and was instrumental in closing in 21 days!!  We couldn't have made a better choice. Ask for Gloria - she is one of a kind!!<//Text>

Tyson and his team were amazing to work with.  The process was seamless from start to end. I have had the pleasure working with Tyson on both sides of a real estate transaction when representing clients, I could not have had a better experience. We can't wait to work with Tyson's team again in the future.</Review>

<time>1610264750029< /time><rating>5< /rating><review>Tyson helped us purchase our first home and I cannot overstate how easy and comfortable he made the whole process.

As first time homebuyers, the process of purchasing is nothing short of daunting. Tyson truly made it an enjoyable experience. Even though Tyson frequently represents clients with properties several times more valuable than our own, he made us feel that our purchase was every bit as important to him.

When we had difficulty getting responses from other parties involved in the purchase, Tyson remedied these issues with haste. I would shoot a text to Tyson, he would respond in minutes, and just minutes later I would get a call from the other party. Simply put, Tyson gets things done.

We closed on our home in the beginning of 2020, and Tyson still checks in with us to make sure things are going well. When we are ready to purchase another home, there is no doubt that Tyson will be our go-to guy.

Whether you are a first time buyer, or looking to sell your multi-million dollar estate, Tyson has you covered. Give him a call and see for yourself. Tyson is the most genuine, hard working realtor out there - and you'll know it from the first conversation you have with him.

Thank you for everything Tyson!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

As first-time home buyers, my wife and I were in great need of experienced professionals who are knowledgeable of Temecula/Murrieta/Menifee and surrounding areas, as well as the current competitive market climate and what it takes to get a buy offer accepted. From the first time we reached out to Tyson (broker) and Bridgett (real estate agent), they answered our questions immediately, provided thoughtful recommendations, and continuously followed-up with us throughout the home buying process. Bridgett and Tyson are true professionals, always allowing time to ask questions while not being rushed, and an absolute pleasure to work with - during negotiations we always felt they had our best interests in mind.

The process went so smoothly. It only took a few days before we placed our first offer, which was accepted, despite multiple offers made on the property. Bridgett guided us through the process, and we landed our first choice, and just successfully closed escrow! Bridgett and Tyson are a great resource who are very knowledgeable about the process and met our motivation as buyers. They made very thoughtful recommendations, and helped us to consider things we hadn’t thought of before. We would definitely reach out to Tyson and Bridgett in the future, and we would gladly recommend Trillion Real Estate to all our friends and family, and anyone who is considering buying a home in this highly competitive market!<//Review><resp>None</resp>< Pictures>

Working with Tyson at Trillion Real Estate was an absolute dream! We reached out to Tyson after reading such great reviews about Trillion. We had a meeting on zoom, he answered all our questions and helped us understand the ins and outs of Temecula since we were moving from about an hour away. As we moved along with the process Tyson and his team were always just a call or text away. We ended up getting the first place we put an offer on, as first time homeowners I would think this is unheard of. But truly we believe this is because of Tyson and his years of experience and reputation in the area. The escrow process was so easy and Tyson really helped guide us along the way as we purchased our very first home. If 1,000 stars was an option that would be our rating! So grateful to have found Trillion, Tyson and to have worked with such an amazing team!</text>

< Review>
Tyson Robinson real estate is simply "THE BEST".  I am very pleased with the professionalism, knowledge, and the level of effort he puts forth.  Finding a real estate person is easy but finding one that you can trust is a different story.  From day one, his team had a plan and executed it.  If I ever move back to the area, he is the first one I am calling so that I can purchase a home.   Thanks Tyson and Team...Your team was outstanding!<//Review>

Very happy to recommend Tyson and his team! I have known Tyson for a long time. I also follow all of his social channels where he is always dropping knowledge on real estate and educating me. I recently stopped by his office to discuss my home and what the market is for it and was very grateful for his help. I highly recommend him for any real estate deals or rental property management in the Inland Empire and Southern California! Thanks Tyson! 🤘🏻</text>

<Review>I’ve been with Tyson’s company for years now. I was originally introduced by another property manager. She had been in charge of my home and was preparing to retire. Just before her retirement she recommended I go with Tyson Robinson because she’d felt with him in the past and admired how well he took care of his clients. In my experience her assessment was spot on! If you’re looking to buy, sell or rent out your home give his team a try. I was assigned Veronica and she’s been fantastic!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Tyson and his entire team are awesome! Everyone is honest, reliable and trustworthy but most importantly everyone is very kind and genuine. Veronica specifically has been so helpful with all of my questions and concerns as a tenant for the past 3 years. I look forward to using Tyson and his team in the near future to purchase a new home!</review>

Tyson is the quintessential realtor, and we can’t recommend him enough!!< /review><userid>102112201532201246613< /userid><gmap_id>0x80db7fb57c9cf0f1:0x25af826a8529a5f6< /gmap_id></record>

We bought our first home with the help of Tyson, he was recommended by a coworker I have to say he was the best! If we had any questions or concerns he always got back to us right away, he was very friendly and professional. I will most Definitely  recommend him to family and friends. Keep up the amazing work!</text>

I have been using Tyson and his team for managing our rental property over one year.  I was looking for a property manager in Temecula area. The fact that Tyson answered all my questions thoroughly within half an hour via email on a late Friday night really impressed me ! I have then worked with Veronica quite bit since I started to use Tyson’s team to manage my rental.  I’ve been very pleased with her dedication to her client, prompt response to any questions/concerns I may have, light speed to address property issues… I would highly recommend Tyson and his team!<//review>

<text>Tyson represented the seller on the house I just bought. I contemplated leaving this review for a month but decided people should know what we experienced especially since he owns his own company! My offer was contingent and they accepted knowing that, long story short the offer on my condo had a hiccup and didn’t close in time, therefore pushed my closing date 2 weeks out. Not only did he threaten to send us fees but he also allowed the seller to take the ring doorbell and the nest and basically told us too bad because you didn’t close on time. Next time don’t take a contingency because they don’t always close on the exact date! He was extremely rude and unprofessional to my agent and also told her he didn’t work on weekends so don’t bother trying to contact him. I would not recommend him at all!< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>106457980790493837127</UserId.>< Time>

<text>Tyson and his Team are The Best!

When we decided, on a whim,  to sell our home Tyson was there to help us.   He guided us through the process which included re-financing,  selling and buying a new home all within a very short time frame.  He gets things done quickly and professionally.  He also has a great network of professionals from landscaping to financing, it's nice to have someone who can refer you to others to get things done,  all of his referrals have been wonderful.
It's nice to have a Realtor and Friend with such a great reputation in the business. Everyone Loves Tyson and his Team of Professionals.

We proudly tell people Tyson Robinson is our Realtor.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Tyson and his team are extremely helpful in all aspects of real estate. Whether it be buying/selling or renting a property, they are there to help. Response time to inquiries is fast and helpful with information on the spot. They are very personable and look to provide an individual experience. My experience was renting a property with some friends and they helped guide us through the process efficiently and honestly.</review>

<Review>Have been using Tyson and his team for property management for our house in Temecula for almost a year now. Our decision to use them came down to how welcoming and down to earth the team was when we first met them! First Impression are everything. I'm in early 20's so I worried a lot about the quality of the people we decided to let manage our property and they were the ones who left a lasting impression on us. The team treated us like family and friends from the start and didn't mind answering any questions we had throughout the process. They made it very simple and stress free for us. By the time they took pictures our house and uploaded onto the market we had potential renters interested in it that week and decided on our renters by the end of the month. We have had zero issues with them and they have given us the peace of mind we were looking for.So if you are doing your research on potential property managers like we once did, I would look no further then Tyson and his team.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80db7fb57c9cf0f1:0x25af826a8529a5f6<//gmapID></record>

<Text>Tyson is the best real estate agent in Temecula! We had two condos to sell and a house to buy this summer while I was 8 months pregnant. Tyson got it done! He gave us great advice and expectations for the sale of our condos. He sent a professional photographer over to our places and the listing photos were stunning, highlighting everything we knew potential buyers would love. On the day of the listing for the first condo, Tyson had 9 showings set up before it even hit the MLS! The first person to view it put in an offer immediately and after a few times back and forth we came up with a perfect selling agreement. Tyson negotiated terms for us so that we were able to stay in the condo renting back from the buyer until we closed on our new home which was essential being pregnant. The other condo took a little longer to sell as it was a one-bedroom and there were 5 other identical properties on the market. However, with Tyson’s network and expertise he was able to sell that for us as well, and coordinated the closing within a day of purchasing our dream home. We are beyond thrilled with the service and care that we received from Tyson and his team. All the closings went very smoothly with no unexpected delays or issues.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Tyson was fantastic in the purchase of our first home! Without his help and expertise, it would not have been possible. Tyson is patient, kind, and very professional. He is a genuinely nice and honest person, which is hard to find these days. Additionally, Tyson is supported by a staff of amazing people. His entire team helps to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible. Their communication was excellent and we were informed of every step of the home buying process. Tyson showed us properties in our budget and in the areas we desired. He did not waste our time, which we appreciated. Tyson is always accommodating and we are so grateful that he was our realtor. We would not hesitate to use his services again. I would also recommend Tyson for his property management services. Tyson and his team know the Temecula Valley and are knowledgeable about the real estate market and give solid, realistic advice. Years later, we still keep in touch with Tyson as he has great insight. He offers an experience for his clients unlike anyone in the industry and that is because he truly cares. Thank you Tyson!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I've been with Trillion Really Estate for almost 2 years. I only had a month to look for rentals in Murrieta because we lived in North County and our lease was ending. I was also 9 months pregnant with my second, so I was basically house hunting online. I have to give major props to Veronica for being super helpful during such a hectic time in my family's life. Every single member of Tyson's team was extremely helpful in getting us the rental we wanted, within the month that we needed to move. They are very prompt with their responses to any questions I had and still have. They treat us with nothing but kindness and respect and greatly appreciate everyone at that company. I have recommended them to people that are interested in living in the Murrieta area, because I've worked with another property management company before them, and Trillion is hands down a lot more caring and helpful.<//Text>

<text>Wow! amazing experience with Tyson's teams! They handle our rental properties since 2014, have done fantastic jobs and I can't praise enough of their professionalism and services received. We decided to sale some property this year, so Tyson help us to placed 3 properties on the market during past few months. The first property sold when I was oversea for long visit, Tyson took care of everything from head to toes,  made house look fantastic with very minimal cost, and repair/remodel/design so quickly; attracted multiple offers with very qualify buyers; the 2nd property also have multiple offers within 3 days from listing and we choose the full cash buyer; both closed escrow timely! now the 3rd property is already in escrow with tenant still in the house! We have very little or near no down time because of Tyson's extreme efforts and expertise!  It is too good to be true and indeed I feel very fortunate to work with him!!! No wonderful Tyson is the Top Agent and I highly recommend!< /text>< pics>

Working with Tyson over many years now I have witnessed a true professional in action. He is a Real Estate Broker with the utmost care and concern for his clients and their needs. He is one who is responsive, genuinely concerned about the satisfaction of his clients, and he gives back in multiple ways. He is knowledgeable, innovative, extremely hard working, and it is no surprise to me to see his success. I completely understand why homeowners and homebuyers so often choose Tyson to help them buy or sell their home!<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Coming from Orange County, I needed a realtor who knew the Temecula valley well. Tyson and his team were awesome in helping us find the areas that best suited my family's needs.
What I felt made my experience with Tyson great was how well he balances giving you your own space, but being available when you need him. The relationship felt more like a friendship than "business." I felt comfortable asking him for his honest opinion on matters while deciding on a home. I never felt pushed one way or another. His opinion is not overbearing. By nature, he is easy going and grounded. This made me really appreciate his input and knowledge.
If the idea of a pushy realtor scares you, then go with Tyson.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Tyson was amazing! We luckily found Tyson by reading all the good reviews from past clients and he didn't disappoint. My mom needed to sell her home as she was retiring and needed to downsize to a smaller property. He listed my mother's home and it was in escrow within a week. He also was very patient and responsive to my mothers wants and needs and we found the perfect home for my mom. It was all a smooth transaction from the listing to the buying of a another home for my mom. He didn't miss a beat and it was very easy to work with him! He is very knowledgable and an expert in his field.< /Review>< resp>

We are so happy we found Tyson.
He has the best work ethic and is quick with responses.
He really goes out of his way to make everything smooth and easy when buying or looking for a home.
His level of professionalism is above and beyond.
If you're looking to buy or sell, we highly recommend him.
He sold our house within 3 days after listing it, and his entire team is great to deal with.<//Text>

<Text>Tyson was referred to us by a good friend that lived in Temecula. Since we were looking for a house in the San Marcos or Carlsbad area, it did not make sense to hire someone from Temecula, but my friend insisted I should at least meet him. Well, we met with Tyson and liked him right away, we explained to him that we were looking for a house in San Diego County and he said it was not a problem as he knew the area well. He drove down to San Marcos about 25 times (poor guy) to show us properties, we never felt pressured for us to "pick a house and buy it already". He was always understanding if we saw a house but didn't like it for one reason or another. I kid you not, we saw a bunch of houses, but we needed one with a full bathroom downstairs as we have our elderly mother in law living with us. If you have looked at real estate you know that is hard to find, and when you do, it's an older house that needs remodeling. Well, Tyson found the perfect house, in perfect condition in a neighborhood called Belleza near Cal State. We love our place and could not be happier with Tyson's work ethic and dedication to his clients. I, like my friend, highly recommend Tyson for your next real estate transaction.< /Text>< pics>

We looked at a few other agents but they were too large for our taste and we were just thrown onto a distribution list with no follow-up.  Seemed like they wanted us to call them when we saw something!

We were in the process of selling our condo in LA and buying in Temecula and every time we were able to come into town to look at properties Jasmin was always available and responsive to our needs.  Throughout the several months that it took for us to finally find a place that we were completely happy with, Jasmin was always there and the attention to us never wavered.  There were a lot of needs (and wants) and I lost track of how many homes we looked at but Jasmin was always professional and showed no frustrations (if there was any at all) about my pickiness.

We would definitely work with Trillion again and will refer all of our friends and family to them!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I found Tyson thru Yelp a couple of years ago and sent him a message. He was very responsive and friendly. I loved how he seemed like I was talking to a friend and not a pushy realtor. I was going through some very difficult times taking care of my terminally ill mom so it was comforting to find Tyson. I was able to trust him and have one less huge responsibility taken care of for me.  Tyson was on my side. I never told him what I was going through but I felt like he just knew and he handled everything so professionally and patiently.  During the next year, as my mom’s health worsened, I had to sell more of my properties. I, without hesitation, went directly to Tyson. He never knew, but my mom ended up passing away and I was just happy to have someone I could trust to handle 3 house sales for me during what I consider the most stressful time of my life. Thanks Tyson & Team!</text>

<text>I'm so happy we chose Tyson to help us find our first home.  First he helped us find a beautiful house within our modest budget.  He was there every step of the way to answer questions and give advise.  We lived 2 hours away and thought that escrow would be a nightmare.  Thanks to Tyson and his team it was 30 days and done.  We are now living in the perfect place for us and it's all thanks to Tyson and his intuition and savvy in this market.<//text>< time>

<Text>I wanted to wait a bit to write this review in case Tyson and his team do not live up to expectations. I can now confirm that they have, and exceeded them as well.

Prior to hiring Trillion Real Estate to manage my property, I was working with another person from another company and that was underwhelming. I paid her $100 a month (I'm paying Trillion $99) to manage my property, but manage she did not. I had to deal with the tenants myself, had to collect rent myself, had to basically do everything myself. She just acted as a third-party intermediary, often slowing things down and adding confusion to the mix.

Then I consulted with another management company to prepare my property for rental and they were inflexible and not very accommodating. Finally, I reached out to Tyson and they were just INCREDIBLE.

First, they were willing to list my property for rental AND to sell to see which would yield the best result. Mind you, this adds much more work on their end because they had to do showings on weekends to potential buyers and then show the home to potential renters. But they did it, without extra charge.

We ended up renting our property and they have been managing it since January of this year. And it's been smooth-sailing ever since. They take care of everything for me. I'm the type who do not want to be involved at all, so they only email me to get approval on any work that needs to be done on the property. They take care of the rest.

Tyson, Veronica, and Ernie are the dream team and I would definitely go to them for anything property-related. Rental? Trillion. Selling? Trillion. Buying? Trilion. You're in good hands.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Tyson and his staff were very professional and great to deal with.  They helped us sell our house and at every step of the process, Tyson and his staff were attentive and quick to get back with us with answers to our numerous questions. They accommodated a lot of our requests and we really appreciated that.  We highly recommend them!</Review>

The marketing Tyson has done on our property is top notch. Professional video and photos.  He has also hit all the the social media sites with our home.  If you want a Real Estate Agent that gives your home full exposure to every potential buyer he is your agent.<//review>

Jasmine and Tyson are truly the best real estate professionals out there.They helped us through every step of a cross country move. They were incredibly patient helping us learn every aspect of the Temecula Murrieta area. Both of them know the area in a way that really helped new residents like us make informed decisions on schools, taxes, and neighborhoods. We talked to other realtors before meeting the Robinsons. They simply weren’t willing to take the time that Jasmine and Tyson spent getting us comfortable with the area before making the big decision to purchase. The Robinsons were so responsive and helped us jump at the first opportunity for the perfect house while we were still 2,000 miles away. A heart felt thanks for helping us find our dream home.< /text>

Tyson Robinson helped my wife and I find our dream home! He was always available to answer any questions and really went beyond our expectations. He took the time to show us other listing and when we found what we were looking for, he worked hard to get us the best deal possible and make the whole buying process smooth. He is a real pro, very respectful, I will recommend Mr. Robinson to all family members and friends! "Thank you for your excellent services".< /text>

<text>June marks one year of using Tyson & team as our property management for our rental home in Temecula & we couldn’t be happier! First timer at the rental game & I initially started out with another company because a family friend knew someone, who knew someone, that worked with this other company. I quickly felt uneasy with how everything was unfolding & regretted not first contacting Tyson Robinson. I put up with the other company for almost two weeks & kept looking back at all of Tyson’s wonderful reviews & I finally called him & immediately felt that it was going to be in good hands! I dumped the other prop management & Tyson instantly was on the ball with the process. While everything was starting up, my husband & were moving cross country! He took care of the tenants during the application process. Contract signings were easy. They were able to use their contacts to have a screen repaired that we weren’t able to do prior to our moving out. They organized for a house cleaning to be done & did the entire pre move in inspection with fine detail. Rent is always received on time. The tenant has reported one small concern so far but the team took care of it seamlessly, always keeping an open line of communication & responding quickly to us & the tenants. Seriously, this review could continue to get longer & I can keep going on about how much I appreciate this team of wonderful people but long story short, I have nothing negative to say! Everyone who I’ve worked with has been great!
Thanks Tyson & Team!< /text>< response>

I would recommend Tyson to my Family and friends and really anyone who needs to or wants to buy or sale a home. Tyson is honest, fair, aggressive and the bottom line is he gets the job done. The entire process was handled quickly and efficently.  He handled my sale very smoothly, considering it was a short sale that is impressive. Thanks again Tyson !!!!</review>

Tyson and his team are awesome. He helped us find the house of our dreams. His team had patience (because we had very specific things we wanted within a certain budget), they were honest and quick to jump on listings that they found for us. We would have Tyson handle our buying or selling again in a heartbeat.< /Review>

<pics>None< /pics><Rating>5</Rating><text>We had a rental house in Temecula and were remote landlords, so couldn't stay on top of the tenants. When the tenants stopped paying rent, we had them evicted and then Tyson was able to get into the house to see its condition. It was totally trashed. We had to replace all the carpeting, all the toilets and faucets, totally repaint, you name it. Tyson handled getting the contractors in and made sure the job was done right. Then, not being stupid, we decided to put the house on the market since being a remote landlord had not worked out so well. Tyson handled all the advertising, etc and we ultimately got a price we were happy with in a reasonable time frame. I think without Tyson  it would have been a grueling ordeal for us, being 1500 miles away.  Definitely recommended.<//text></record>

We have only have been with Tyson and his team for 6 months but they have done a wonderful job marketing and renting our Temecula property.  They got a great renter in quickly.  Their accounting and bookkeeping is on time and also excellent.  I looked at other Temecula Property Management companies but Tyson and his team are the clear winners!<//text>

After emailing and contacting about a dozen property management groups in Temecula area, only two responding to all the questions.  After having a sit down with each my wife and I decided to go with Tyson to rent our property.  Three years later I can honestly say it was a good decision.  Our property has went through two tenants with only minor issues, which are always resolved quickly.  They have deconflicted a wind damaged fence, broken washing machine, refrigerator, and plumbing.  Considering we are currently living clear across the country it was and still is a great choice to go with Tyson.<//review>

< Review>
Tyson Robinson is the epitome of professionalism, honesty, and just overall excellent customer service.  It was  very refreshing working with Tyson on the purchase of my home in Murrieta. As opposed to other agents that I've worked with, Tyson truly puts the customers needs as a no.1 priority.

Buying a home is a joyful time but it can also be very stressful. Tyson helped put my wife and I at ease by communicating with us and keeping us informed through every step of the home buying process. Tyson is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to real estate and he strives  to find his clients the exact property that fits their needs while not imposing his own.

I have recommended Tyson to some of my friends and they have purchased and sold various properties through him, they too have nothing but positive things to say about him. I can't say enough good things about him.</Review>

< Review>
Tyson and his team helped us get into our first new home. We were new to the market with no knowledge in it, a tight budget and houses were selling within days of posting. Despite all the obstacles we were facing, Tysons team were still able to get us into the only house we fell in love with. After escrow closed we learnt that our offer was accepted over others solely because they knew and trusted Tysons reputation. So believe it when they say it matters who is representing you! We are so glad we made the decision to go with Tyson and we are grateful for him and his team.

<review>My family and I rented a property in Temecula for a little over a year that Tyson and his team managed. It was a great experience and I cannot say enough good things about them. They were always very professional, courteous, and kind. Any service issues were addressed promptly.

A few months before we moved, the homeowner decided to sell the property. I was so nervous that we would be forced to live in chaos with realtors coming in and out whenever they pleased, but this was simply not the case. Tyson would always give plenty of notice before a showing, and would ask us if it was ok or if we would like to have it done another day. He and his team made the process as smooth as possible.

I wish we could have stayed in Temecula, but we had to move closer to San Diego. If we were to move back, We would love to rent from Tyson and his team again.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE!

We were told he would be showing house at 4 pm, we drove OVER TWO HOURS in traffic and were almost 15 minutes late and he was not there, when we tried to call him (2 separate times) he REJECTED ALL the calls and refused to answer, I emailed him after we started on the hour plus drive home only to get told the next day via email he left at 4:25 which is clearly a lie because we were standing in the drive way at that time, but my daughter had said when we were there she saw someone inside so who knows maybe he was inside with the door locked denying our calls! Then he tried to tell me we showed up at 4:30 but he said he left before then? He says 4:30 because that's when my email sent, but that email was sent when we were on the road already after our calls continued to be rejected!

NO APOLOGY, NO ATTEMPT TO REACH OUT....NOTHING!!!

I am so glad he failed to be where he said he would be and we avoided having to work with him.<//text>

< Review>
The employees are very polite, but not very helpful or educated. I wanted a copy of my CT scan and they told me I had to wait for my doctor to review it first. There is absolutely no logic behind this. That is my medical record and my right to see my results. I wasn’t able to get an explanation of this logic, only that this was “the rule”.< /Review>

Quest is just awesome you take it prices, staff, timelines, call them each and every step was just wonderful experience for me.  Front end staff are very friendly same as advisors, technicians even the training staff each and everyone are just awesome. I think I had the best experience and suggest everyone to visit them if there is a requirement. God bless everyone and keep away from all medical needs everyone should be healthy. But if there is a need I would suggest Quest.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3vywmn6ILcrS46yWDffGOwAKWf9i2mCc9zdmb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtmpU62PB3QUWH7fW3lZchGfGtysm47_78pWuv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIgBejTKwnYzAiYeKMvR6eEGtdSW0xSmMLtFR7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcczSbZjSulaFvNrQ7ushvl_a6ki8SN0p5reAf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures></record>

<review>I had a great experience I was a little scared to go .I'm glad I did .they are practicing and following through with the social distancing and very clean .there service was outstanding .then the procedure I had done was a scary one that I didn't 5hibk I'd be able to finish it.it turned out I was wrong my 2 nurse's were amazing they talked to me the hole time keeping me focused and because of them 2 ladies I was able to finish the hole test without having to stop.they helped me clean up after and made sure I was good before I left.the doctor was a nice man he talked to me telling me what he was doing and kept me in the loop during the hole procedure.if I can choose my self on where to get my imaging done I'd definitely choose them every time.</review>< pictures>

Went for an ultrasound, after waiting 45 minutes past appointment time, I checked and was told the tech was busy, but they should get to me shortly.  After another 15 minutes I left, nice people up front, clueless and are definitely disorganized and out of touch with their business.< /text>

I was there for a CT scan. Everything ran on time and very professional. The registration process was efficient. The staff in  the  CT/MRI area were professional and attentive. The process was over rather quickly and I was on my way. I will continue to use Quest Imaging when the need presents it self.< /review>

I am 68 years old and this was my first experience with having to get an ex-ray. Everyone from the front desk to administration to the ex-ray technician were very professional and informative. The ex-technician told me what she was going to do and why, and what I need to do. This information made the whole process go smoothly and easily for me.<//Review>

The best part of each visit is that you feel that they really care about you and your needs. It is as if you are their only patient, and your care and comfort are first with them. Why would you want to go anywhere else?< /text></record>

I had a very good experience the day I came in for my mammogram.  The person at the front desk was cordial and seemed more friendly as I was leaving.  The check in was quick and the gal doing my exam was very friendly.  Thank you!< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I had an ultrasound and biopsy and everything went so well as explained by the wonderful staff.  Cheryl is tops in making me feel comfortable and well taken care of.  My only complaint is the lack of coordination between Quest and Kaiser for the mammogram at the Chester facility.  It took 4 month to get the mammogram scheduled.  I am not sure who dropped the ball at Chester Quest and Kaiser but intend to find out and I hope you do too.<//text>< pics>

Overall I had a very positive experience at Quest Imaging. The staff was professional and friendly and the waiting areas were very nice. I especially was appreciative of how nice the women's health wing was. It was clean, very centered towards women (women's magazines and HGTV on the tv), the dressing room and the restroom were very nice, and overall this area made me feel more at ease about the reason I was there. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is because I wasn't taken back for my imagine until 30 minutes after my appointment and there was no communication. If an office is running behind, I totally understand, but would appreciate being told when checking in for my appointment so I can make sure I can make arrangements for my other obligations.<//review>

I've had multiple MRI's here across the years from lots of sports injuries.  Every time i've been in, they are courteous, prompt, and get things done right away.  I'm not sure what else you could hope for beyond that!  It's also incredibly clean.</Text>

My experience was far greater than expected. Was able to get the tests done even though I was a week late (my fault not theirs) because I got appointments mixed. They didn't get impatient or snotty like some other places but were understanding and did all they could to get me in. Thanks for the hospitality!!< /Text>

<Text>I had a great experience starting from the moment I walked in. My doctor ordered a stat exam and they got me in right away, they talked with the Tech and he was very accommodating even though they had a full schedule they still made way. The girl that registered me took me back right away and was very compassionate. When she called the scheduler to put me on the schedule the scheduler was very helpful and compassionate as well, the whole time I was there everybody had a great smile on their face and I just felt welcomed. When I was in the back with the Tech I thanked him for getting me in right away. He smiled and just said it was his pleasure. I felt at ease and really felt the love of God through these guys. Thank you all for your hard work and for letting God shine through you!</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Cons
- did not like having only one waiting room for their MRI machines. As a female, I was not comfortable sitting in a hospital gown around men.
- scheduling an appointment was difficult. Their main appointment line was all computerized. Finally found another number to get a real person on the phone.

Pros
- good service
- great staff
- clean facility
-quick turn around time on imaging< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have always had friendly, professional and timely care at Quest. We live in a rural mountain area an hour outside of Bakersfield and they do their best to accommodate me with appointments when I’m in town or when I already have a trip into town planned.
The staff are all so kind & reports get to my doctors so quickly.</Review>

I like the ambiance of Quest. It feels like your at a Day Spa. Everyone are very nice and helpful. I came for a mammogram. I didn't have to wait very long. Doing the test was fine. The tech was very concerned that I was comfortable thru the whole process. Everything was great. I do tell people to have their test done at Quest.<//review>

<Review>They are some of the most professional and nice people you will meet anywhere in the medical world. From the initial greeting, to handling the paperwork, meeting nurses and docs, the experience could not be any better. Everything was explained clearly, and you get the impression that they really do care about delivering wonderful service.  So, you can rest assured this is a great facility.  H.

Quest Imaging is one of the few medical services that posts the results of your test promptly! It is such a relief to get your test results within a few days and not have to wonder for weeks. The Stockdale location is the best facility in Bakersfield.< /Text>

When I go to Quest Imaging on Stockdale Highway I am greeted with respect and kindness, and through the whole process I am treated with Respect and Kindness.
And when I am all done with the procedure I am told to have a Blessed Day and kindly told and shown how to exit the building.

I have already recommended Quest to friends. I have always had excellent service - have had mammograms, bone density scans and MRI's. From the receptionist all the way to technicians, everyone has been very helpful and compassionate. Thank you for your service to our community!</Text>

How strange that there are so many negative reviews.  I have been going to Quest Imaging on Stockdale Hwy every time there was a need and the staff have been efficient, friendly, polite and just wonderful.  Never was there once an unpleasant incidence.  As with all, if  you show them respect, they return the same.< /Text>

<text>I was at quest imaging on 21st of March for a CAT Scan with and without contrast.  I was treated with respect, compassion, and empathy.   And concern was not phony.  I am highly  claustropic and they made me feel at ease. Several different individuals from receptionist to nurse to CAT tech were welcoming answered all my questions and made sure I understood procedure and what to expect.  Each were right on. They made sure that the disc from Kern radiology was downloaded and returned plus provided me with CD from the CAT scan. They had results from BUN and creatinine which was down at Stephen strategos’s Office. I had a pleasing and very positive experience.< /text><time>1553289758151</time><user_name>Paul Jacobson< /user_name>< rate>

From beginning to end, scheduling, check-in and mammogram tech were all extremely professional, knowledgeable and pleasant.  They made  the experience much more bearable than your typical mammogram. Thank you!</text>

I have been going to Quest Imaging for many years.  The staff is always nice, the wait is not bad at all, and it's a lovely facility. I highly recommend women come here for 3D Mammograms.  My husband comes for xrays and my brother goes there to have his nephrostomy tube changed.  Five star ratings from us!!!!!!</Text>

I would recommend Quest Imaging-Stockdale if you are looking for a place to have x-rays and ultrasounds done. They are professional, punctual, and they explain every step of the process.</review>

Staff was pleasant and the checkin was efficient and the waiting room was comfortable. I am glad they don’t keep rooms too cold because it’s hard to wear just a thin gown in a cold room. I was a new patient in 2016.<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80ea43db939c910f:0x744fb4f44653450e< /GmapID>< Review>
The only problem I encountered was the scheduling. I was initially told by a live person that my appointment would be at 7:45 a.m.  Later, I received a recording stating my appointment time as 7:45 a.m. but to arrive at 7:15.  Still later, I received another recording stating that my appointment time was 8:30 a.m but to arrive by 8:00 a.m.

Naturally, I didn't want to be late so I arrived at 7:15 a.m.  After completing the paperwork, I proceeded to wait while another person was taken to an office for processing. Soon, a staff member approached me, asked me what time my appointment was and reassured me that I would be next.  I learned that another patient who was also waiting had also received dual recordings. A staff member apologized for the recording mixup but my appointment was at the later time of 8:30 a.m.

I was not angry but this type of error should not be happening, especially so early in the morning.  This review is intended only to alert staff of the problem. Once my appointment time arrived, I received excellent care with only one hiccup of another wait time between tests.<//Review>

< Review>
Do NOT come here for an pregnancy ultrasound. They would not let me back to view so I missed out on seeing the sex of my first child. Even though we are married they would not let me back. My wife pleaded with the ultrasound tech to let me back, to no avail. Screw this place they are insensitive. They ruined what should have been a happy memory for me and my wife.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The doctor who attended me fatal teach stacey tarango I do not recommend the place for ultrasound
I am 5 months old and he did not tell me if he is going to be a boy or a girl, and it took him about 1 hour to take measures
I think it was learning or new

(Original)
La doctora q me atendió fatal teach stacey tarango no recomiendo el lugar para ultrasonido
Tengo 5 meses y no me dijo si va hacer nino o niña 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬y tardó como una 1 hora según para tomarle medidas
Creo q era aprendía o nueva</Review>
