We did the special Hamburger Month special with a WAGYU burger - EXCELLENT QUALITY AND COOKED to perfection for $10 and almost double if you had a soft drink and "extra" such as grilled onions.
Could not ask the source because although the Hotel attendant picks up the phone immediately, there is no way to talk to the kitchen.
We chose PICK-UP and it was a nightmare if you did not have APPLE PAY, which we did not and so ordered on the computer.  We ordered at 3 PM, first slot open; were told "around 4:17PM" and got the order at 4:40 after waiting at the curb.   The guy who brought the food out was super unfriendly.  The fries were cold and hard as soon as we tried them in the car.
Would not order food from here again but would definitely go in for dinner..<//Text>

After being in LA for a week and desperately trying to find genuine GOOD food... we FINALLY FOUND IT. STK Steakhouse is AMAZING, and beautifully decorated. Service is fast, and tentative, and besides the high volume of patrons, your food wont take an hour to come. Would fly in to LA to eat here every week if I could. Love this place, couldn’t recommend it more !!!! (:</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>What a wonderful place. Located inside the W  Hotel, STK does a fine job providing great service and a quality product. My wife and I prefer to stay at W hotels whenever we travel throughout the United States especially with the bedroom furniture, specifically the beds!!  The finest  Most comfortable beds you would ever want to sleep in. A truly hip place with an  eclectic crowd and a quality steak house that rivals any in Los Angeles. A great choice with style. Patrick, the man orchestrating restaurant operations, makes you feel like family from the start. Can't thank him enough.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2beb0bb7b9b4d:0x8d30fe20ba2f239e<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Wow! My boyfriend and I celebrated Christmas just the two us and ordered a Christmas meal for two from this restaurant. It was packaged beautifully and they gave us way more than enough for two! We had turkey, stuffing and apple pie leftover for the next day. The food was so delicious. The sweet potato mash was perfectly balanced with warm spices and creaminess. I highly recommend this place for a special occasion takeout!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I had the cowgirl ribeye it was delicious, perfectly cooked, we also had the happy hour lil burgers ( yes they have happy hour Sunday through Thursday from 3-630) anyways it was super yummy, but the happy hour lil burger is only one so don't think it's enough to share, but it  comes with a small side of truffle fries. The bacon mac and cheese is good but the bacon is not like regular bacon it's different tasting not bad just different. We finished off with the warm cookie and omg eat your heart out BJ's pizookie there is a new warm cookie mvp.< /text>< pictures>

So we were super excited to go to this beautiful place for Valentines Day. I made reservations a week before for 8:30pm. It was a $200 deposit to make the reservations and applies to your dinner. We got there and waited in line about 15 min to check in. Finally got to the front and we were told we had to wait another 45 min for our table to be ready either at the bar or stand around and wait. Mind you, there is another line for the bar which looks to be about another 30 min wait, and it's cold outside because it's only outdoor dining because of covid. 1 hour later I go back to the front to check on the table, they say it's going to be another 30 to 45 min wait. It's already 9:30pm so we wouldn't be getting a table til almost 10:30. We canceled the table and went to Denny's lol smh. They told me that they overbooked and it really got away from them somehow. They said people were only allowed to be at their table for about 75 min and staying longer, but they weren't doing anything to keep ppl within their time. So overall, I was highly disappointed with how things went for Valentines Day. The food was probably really good but I would know because it took way too long. I've never had a reservation at a restaurant and had to wait more than 15 min, if that. I would probably go on a regular day just to try the food but never again on a holiday.

*UPDATE*

Here's an update after what happened on Valentine's Day. I was contacted to allow them to accommodate me and my partner for another dinner at the date of my choice. We did set a date and went back for the on the house dinner and drinks and let me tell you, it was exactly what I thought it would be. The food was amazing, the drinks were great, and the customer service was outstanding. The manager even came over to check on us and apologized for the Valentine's Day dinner fiasco. He admitted that it was definitely a crazy night and I see that they did improve on how to handle those kinds of occasions better. The music and atmosphere was also great. The waiter, Niko, was amazing and very attentive and accommodating. They even brought us a surprise dessert that was delicious! Overall, I truly appreciate them making up for the last visit and would definitely go back for dinner and drinks. STK has become a favorite and can't wait to try other items on their menu. Definitely give them a try.< /text>

During the pandemic this location is currently only seating people outdoors. It can get a bit cold and breezy so bring a jacket, especially if you're having cold drinks! Make sure you check when their happy hour is! I went on a saturday and it went from 3 pm to 6:30 pm. They have half priced cocktails($9.50) and half priced oysters! ($2) the oysters were absolutely delicious.  We were told that the king crab oscar was a must have so my entire party ordered it, but I honestly wouldn't again. The crab pieces were all broken up and small, and there were tons of shell pieces inside. The location has valet parking, and some parking on nearby streets, but some streets require a permit so double check the signs!  I would make a reservation because then we left the line was extremely long! There isn't really a dress code but most people were dress very well. Their payment system is an electric check which can email and print the receipt for you.< /text>

The bread appetizer arrived very cold. The service was average. It is definitely a loud atmosphere and not a place where you can enjoy privacy. Very pricey for the experience.< /Text>

This has to be one of the worst experiences ever. Our reservations were made for valentine's day in advance to celebrate. We got there at 7 seated at 830 and left the restaurant at 1030 with nothing to eat. They seem like they overbooked by like a 1000 people. The security guard was extremely rude and unprofessional yelling at customers waiting for hours for their tables. We were charged 200 for the reservation in advance and now all we have to eat is fast food. They ruined a very special day for us. Never dining here again.<//Review>

I don’t know where to start. I don’t write reviews but this place is a joke!!! I made this reservation ahead of time keep in mind they charge 100per person to book a reservation. I arrived 10 min early to my reservation. Had to wait in cold over an hour. Just like me there was about 20+ other ppl waiting. Don’t over book if you can not accommodate. Over all this is the worst experience ever!!<//Text>

Arrived at 705 and didn't get to our table till around 8:45 only to be talked down to by staff and security. We made this reservation early for valentine's day. We also paid $200 with reservation that was supposed to go to our tab. It is now 1040 and have not received ANY food. You guys completely destroyed our valentine's day and our anniversary dinner. Stay away..never dining at this establishment again. WE WANT OUR REFUND PROMISSED</text>

It was a nice plus that they offer in house delivery - although they also do deals with 3rd party delivery services. We had the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala in coconut milk, potato samosa and mango Lassi's. This place is a gem. I hope they are around for many years to come! Thank you!<//Text>

<Text>We gave this spot a second chance because Larry (the owner) invited my party back after a bad valentines day. I've been to many of LA's higher class restaurants like Arthur J, Perch LA, 71 above and Mastros etc. Stk is definitely the spot to go for amazing steak and amazing non-steak options. (we recommend the lobster linguini for the non-steak option) and the dry aged delmonico for the steak option. Sides that were notable were mashed potatoes (I know what youre going to say they're just mashed potatoes but no you gotta try it), Brussel sprouts and mixed veggies were better than most I've had as well. All around it's a well rounded restaurant. I will be honest their bubbles menu is smaller than most but their wine selection is massive. Will need to try the wine and desserts next time around.</Text><rate>5< /rate>< user_name>

< review>
Worst steak I have ever had. I placed and order last night for one ribeye steak and one flat iron. My bill was 175$.  The ribeye was over cooked even through I ordered it medium, has not taste. Common this is a 90$ plate ? I won’t even pay 5$ for this steak. Shame< /review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>My experience on July 3rd was great until there was a additional $100 charge to my credit card that was to be voided. I was told by my server that the charge would be voided and it was not. I contacted STK twice to have the matter resolved and was told a manager would get back to me both times and no one ever did. At that point I needed to file a dispute with my bank and everything was handled accordingly on my end. Unfortunately, my bank had no luck either and I was out and overcharged $100. I’ve always been a fan of STK and the service has always been exceptional but the failure to resolve this issue has changed my mind.

Update: The manager contacted me and the issue has been resolved. Thank you for such a swift response.<//Review>< pictures>

We live across the street from this restaurant and absolutely love it. The staff is always very nice to us and treats us well since we are regulars. We recently got engaged and came here for a celebratory dinner. They were so nice to us and went out of their way to make the dinner special. If you want a fun and trendy atmosphere and great food come here for a fun dinner!<//review>

This place was absolutely phenomenal. According to my father, it was the best steak and best meal in Los Angeles he’s ever had! I had the braised short rib which was 10/10. Were going back again next week!</review>

Brought my mom, sister and grandma here for dinner. *( Lots of stairs upon arrival). Decor is nice clean and open. Started with the Lobster ravioli for the appetizer. The sauce was phenomenal. I  ordered cowgirl ribeye, sister had the 6oz filet mignon mom had the sea bass. We ordered asparagus, creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese for the sides.< /Review>

A nice spot for a meal inside the W hotel. Very nice, great and friendly service and the food is fantastic. A nice wine selection as well and a nice more modern but still classic take on a steakhouse. It doesn’t feel stuffy but rather a mixture of both classic and modern elegance which is nice.<//review>

<Text>Go to Mastro’s in Beverly Hills instead.

STK used to be awesome - been to several around the country. This location in the W Hotel in LA has great atmosphere.

The place was 3/4 empty at 8:30 on a Friday  - I should have just walked out.

We ordered the A5 Wagyu - $30 per ounce, 4 ounce minimum - one 4oz, one 6oz. They were both bad. Gristly and bland. I was shocked at how bad they were. Everything on the plate was at most ‘warm’ at best. Borderline cold.

Ordered the truffle fries - warm. Bland.

Ordered the Jalapeño Cheese Grits - bland, not hot.

All the food came out quickly, no idea why it wasn’t hot.

A manager came by to ask about the meal - I told him the steak wasn’t good - he said he’d pass along my feedback to the chef.

The general manager came by and he was very empathetic.

Nice people all around, friendly and quick service. But the food was just not that good.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbjQwtQwNhEi2EXuJ5PsyXpiqLJ72TX4_LJ4r6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1nKr7ZyM3QvygvLgU30-8TcTyKeOGsjgFRp8Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_bxys5dDra1EjC0BpCLROLnHuAOOns3gBmlhA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND-92WlCQaDvazM55Cs0spxS122OIzDM1PhEUz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvurngNT1aVnZqJ06OluyR4_YcGdLZskvleHUz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl7FYm5M81cC4s-5vRB5JNckPSbUMGXekPGHxC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

STK is an excellent choice if you are looking for a great steak and an lively, upbeat and fun atmosphere.  I celebrated my birthday here and the staff went above and beyond.  In addition to my birthday I have gone several times for dinner and the staff has always been attentive and helpful, even down to helping me pair my steak with the perfect sauce and wine.  Drinks are great, food is amazing (Jalapeño Cheddar Grits), let's just say I've never liked grits, but THOSE are unbelievably delicious.  I love this place and I will be back soon!  Not to mention, you may run into a celebrity or two.  Thanks for being great guys!<//review>

Very cozy and clean steak House! The food taste and quality is top notch. The drinks are well made and taste great. Finally the service is great as well. I really wish more people would come here. The fact that it's out of the way in the hotel kinda keeps it out of sight out of mind...< /Review>

After my experience today, I doubt I’ll ever come back to the restaurant again. I traveled from Connecticut and I’m currently staying at the W Hotel and decided to go downstairs and get a quick bite. I ordered a prawn salad which was actually really good. Jimmy was my waiter, I asked him for the check and a box, he proceeds to bring me my check and explained he added the %15 gratuity already to my tab. The total for my salad was $19.00 plus tax a %4 surcharge my subtotal was $21.64 plus the tip he added brought my total charged $26.00. Soo I’m sitting there doing the math and also feeling completely violated... How the heck do you one just add your own gratuity without asking how I wanted to pay for it your not sure I have cash. I’ve worked in the food industry before I’m aware how it goes and servers need to work for their tips but at what expense apparently mine... I let Jimmy know there was one an issue with the gratuity added it’s over %20 percent. I had a salad and a water..... He then proceeds to tell me there’s an issue with the system and they need to have it fixed. He brings it back the corrected receipt and Im able to add me own tip now and now I see how he was able to add his own tip and then rounded it up to the nearest dollar.  I asked to speak with a manager the manager came over and I explained the situation and he apologized and offered me some drink tickets. I advised he will speak with Jimmy in regards to the situation. The moral of this review is to enlighten people to check your receipts because if not you’ll have someone taking advantage of you and then smile in your face, also to expose those of you who do these types of things and it may seem minor to some people but me personally when I do decide to spend my OWN money I don’t want anyone to decide how to spend my own money and steal and scam from me.</Text>

<review>Simply the best steak I've had. The Ribeye. Tuna Tartare highly recommended. Great staff. Cool vibe. Surf N Turf on Valentine's Day was extra delicious. To enjoy fine dining in an atmosphere such as this is rare. With a Live DJ, and lounge areas to mingle, you can't help but meet people, spot a celeb or 2, share drinks with some interesting people and have an unbeatable night.
Food beyond Excellent - Service is world class - personal, yet relaxed. Eating Fliet Mignon with gold leaf lobster and caviar on top comes with a risk of catching a whiff of narcissistic snootiness...NOT HERE.
It may conjure up stuffy, traditional, manly, but STK manages to have the fine dining in a space where you can socialize and party without holding back. It has a vibe that is welcoming AND Exclusive all at once.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS4FhQPaKbESDplwQm8bXAtVs2HJw5xEaTwUBi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFvjY2iuss6GXcsCSrTc3i8Ob8Zp1XtoZnE9or=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< rate>

Be sure to valet. Its quick and convenient and the valets are all really welcoming. Atmosphere in the restaurant itself is great! And the staff is friendly. But it's the food that makes coming here worth it. From the Salmon, to the skirt steak, to the petit filet, to the jumbo shrimp, and even the sides and dessert we ordered, were all splendid and packed with amazing flavor. Plus, all three of my strawberry cobblers were made to perfection. My only criticism is that I wish our server could have been a lot more personable. I don't even recall if he ever mentioned his name. Aside, from taking our orders he had nothing else to discuss with us and made a rather quick getaway each time he visited our table.</review>

Went last night for my date's birthday. We absolutely loved it. I ordered Mary's Organic Chicken and mashed potatoes and she ordered the Mac n Cheese with sliders on the side. Food was amazing,  the music was perfect.  Then lastly the birthday  dessert was beautiful , our waiter was very attentive and awesome! We will definitely be back. I Dont look at things to be expensive when you want to have a great time<//review>

All style lacks substance. The food was good but not worth the prices, it seemed more like a club/lounge where people went to get seen instead of a fine steakhouse.<//Text>

The steaks weren’t really good. They don’t have nothing special.  My experience in general wasn’t very pleasant. They are gossipers and liars. A friend of mine called the restaurant and they told her that o was sitting here with another person younger than me and some other stuff no respect. The prices are reasonable. The music playing in the restaurant is loud. The service is great.</Text>

<text>The food wasn't the greatest. I ordered chicken and my date ordered fish. The chicken was a bit dry to the point I could have cooked it at home better.

As far as presentation, my date had her fish handed to her on a mini pizza dish (e.g. a black wafer) with zero condiments. The presentation was pretty pathetic considering this was an "upscale" venue where dinner costs at least 100 dollars or more

I will say that the waitress was awesome though. She was thoughtful and did everything she could to serve us and cater to us. I would have given it a 1 star but due to her attentiveness, I am rating this venue a 3.<//text>< pics>

Ivory was wonderful with great, attentive service. Food was top-notch. Everything was wonderful. Only downside was I had so much wonderful bread at the beginning that I didn't save room for dessert!</Review>

We celebrated my son getting into a great college and our time together so we selected this restaurant as a special venue close to UCLA and because of good reviews. I noticed that reviews were very mixed but ignored this fact because I love STK on Orlando so I was hoping for the same level of service. I was very wrong.

We were greeted without any interest, no eye contact, "come with me". There was something spilled on the floor next to the table, we asked to clean up and no one came. Overall, it was excellent food and poor service with an attitude. The bread was great and the waiter suggested another one and we agreed (we were hungry after a day of running around campus:-) but the delivery person gave us an attitude and literally yelled around "the second bread!" No one said "bye" to us when we left despite very good tips (the food was excellent).

When I asked about the restroom, I was told that there was no restaurant restroom, there is one in the W hotel where it's located (which is perfectly fine, but the hotel restroom was not cleaned up well and not stocked up), so overall, it was not the experience you expect of STK.</Text><user_name>Mariya Breyter<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've heard so many good things about STK Los Angeles. However my experience was not  a good one. We had a party of 12 on July 15th 2016 reservations were at 8pm. We were there on time. 30 minutes went by before we got water or before our waiter Kyle introduced himself. We eventually order appetizers which took almost an hour before they came out. They apologized with a round of shots. No id's were checked and drinks were given to a 17 and 19 year old. This was enough to ruin my experience and I  doubt that I will return.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Super disappointed. Went here for my birthday dinner and was so excited for a good steak...seeing as its a steak restaurant. In a nutshell it was overcooked, tough, and flavorless. I didn't want to complain at the time since we were with a big group who was treating me to dinner, but I later wrote an email to the manager (it was that bad). He wrote back saying he would give me a free appetizer next time I went. Gee thanks.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I've been to the other STKs many times, but tonight's experience was the absolute best I've ever had. First off, the quality of staff is superb. Our server was Rachel and she was everything. She knew the menu really well and was super fun and sweet. When I mentioned that the steak might have been a little overcooked, which I was willing to deal with, she instantly went ahead and put in a new one for me and it came back perfect. The manager, Caroline, came over to see if everything with our table was all right. I found extremely pleasant an accommodating. Then we met Lai-Ling, who was also really nice and added to the atmosphere. Honestly, they were very nice people and the quality of their service was seriously top notch for me. I really appreciate the amount of attention that went into making sure we were OK and satisfied and I found everyone in the staff to be in high spirits and they were really friendly. Rachel was seriously amazing, though, and I'd just like to say she really made this experience perfect. I'll be back and bringing more friends, for sure.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>we went for my sisters birthday this past weekend. we were running late for our reservation because my flight got delayed twice we made it right before the kitchen closed and they still accommodated us with a smile (they didn't know my flight was delayed so its not like they felt sorry for us) the food was better than i thought it would be. Im very picky I pretty much only like chicken because I'd rather not eat red meat if i have a choice and I hate seafood so I was a bit disappointed to see they only have one chicken dish on the menu... i guess people with an expensive palate don't like chicken lol jk. Let me tell you though, their one and only chicken dis was sooo good i was surprised. (please add more chicken options) . and the strawberry cobble cocktail DELICIOUS and i'm not big on alcohol (SHOUTOUT TO THE BARTENDER WORKING THE LAST SHIFT ON SEPT 21) Our server was amazing he was so nice and his friendliness was genuine not fake like a lot of servers fishing for a big tip. super nice guy i believe his name was andre. AND I love what they did for everyone celebrating a birthday very different from what other restaurants do.  THE DESERTS WERE SOOOO GOOD we got donuts, strawberry cream shortbread with sorbet, and a huge cookie icecream sandwich everything was amazing</review>< Pics>

Food was delicious with a lot of strong, interesting flavors. Vibe was more party atmosphere and steakhouse, but did not take away from the food.< /Text>

<response>None</response><Review>I had a fantastic time here! I came with a group of 7 to celebrate my 21st birthday. I made my reservation a month in advance, but they reached out to me right away to confirm, and they also called the week before to see if there was any changes/updates. The hostess and server were extremely friendly and accommodating. Of course the food was remarkable! I had a del Monaco steak which was to die for!!! My sides were also suuuuper yummy. To drink I had a strawberry cobbler martini which was sooo good. My party all enjoyed their meals! You already know you’re going to be spending at least $100/person so take that into consideration, however it’s totally worth it. The atmosphere is beautiful inside and out, you can take some really nice “instagram” worthy photos.  I would def be back to celebrate another special occasion!<//Review>< rating>

Very beautiful place. Looks like a club on one side. Seen a few athletes hanging out. My only issue is the food lol I ordered crab legs. I was expecting something so different I had three small pieces of crab shells with crab meat on top on ice. I couldn't believe it lol. I sent it back cause there was no way I was paying for such a thing. Dessert was great and creamy spinach is good. Don't come here on an empty stomach cause this isn't the place.< /text>

Do not go here. Horrible establishment.  Had a party here and they kicked us out because the district attorneys family was at the restaurant.  I spent 4K for a party and the district attorney asked that we be removed.  I’m filling charges through my credit card. I can’t even explain how i was Treated.<//Review>

This place is fun! It's great if you're looking for busy Hollywood night scene. Great for entertaining business clients. I see a lot for that happening here and always see people having a good time. Bartenders and staff are very friendly. My only complain is that service can be pretty slow when busy.
Their food is decent. I enjoy their petite filet steak and kumamoto oysters the most.</review>

From the amuse-bouche to the muscato-paired desserts, this restaurant is in a league of it's own. The kitchen delivers flavors your tastebuds will never forget. The Michelin Star guide needs to seriously get back to L.A. and give this place some more stars.</Review>

<Review>i love this place, it's everything one could want out of la - insanely trendy, great people-watching, fun bar scene, oh, and the food is pretty good too!  i'm never disappointed with their rib-eye or mac n cheese, the tuna tartare is fresh and tasty and of course, can't go wrong with the chocolate molten cake.  not cheap but always worth the trip!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

This place is overrated, I had reservations at 8:30 got there half hour early went to the bar have few drinks. Didn't get seated till 9:00, waiter had adduitde,my fiancée found bug in her drink, are food took over hour didn't start eating till 10:15, the potatoes where cold and hard. Place to pricey for terrible food. The only decent thing is drinks and music. Never go here again Mastros Steakhouse way better.</Review>

The service was spectacular, the mood was very set by the awesome DJ (the restaurant DJ was better than the lounge DJ), I ordered the Ribeye of course and it was fantastic. Of the sides, the Sweet Corn Pudding was to die for. For dessert I had the Sweet Potato Dounuts and they were amazing, melted in my mouth. The sweet potatoes were so pronounce that it seemed like it could have been healthy, but we all know Dounuts aren't. To top it all of, valet was great and even gave me water for the road. Amazing experience. @zoeesl</Text>

<rating>4</rating><text>Life is good when you can afford to come to a shi-shi fancy hollywood steakhouse like STK on a whim with some good friends, enjoy some choice cuts of meat on sizzling plates, and down it with some vino and chatter while admiring the pretty people coming in.

DineLA was happening, so some college buddies and I made a date for me to try out  STK. One of my steak-and-bacon buddies had been rating this place #2 steakhouse in LA, and I had to try it. In the end, I had to agree with him. #2 steak in LA.

THE SCENE
Walked in, and was immediately impressed by the entry. Long awning with waterfalls and stone walls leads you in on a red carpet. Yes, we sure are hollywood adjacent. The hostesses are all in black, all young and pretty, and they lead you to your table once everyone is there. The tables are in a big open area, so it definitely isn't like an old-school mobster-esque steakhouse with enclosed booths and dark decor. Here it was dark, but only enough to be chic. The walls were textured and well lit. It felt slightly too masculine for a romantic date, but then again it still was a steakhouse. It was perfect for a friend reunion.

THE MUSIC
Normally, i would never dedicate an entire review section to the music, but holy balls whatever the DJ there was spinning had be in the best mood ever. Mashups -- EDM with 80s classic ballads, old school rock and kid cudi, I mean the most crazy stuff, but it was SO GOOD. I kept asking my human-jukebox friend what each song was because I could not stop listening and talking about how great the music was. Definitely will be back for Happy Hour to enjoy the tunes, wine, and cheap bites!

THE FOOD
After seeing some mixed reviews, I was worried I might not like my steak. After all, steak and I go way back, and I've been spoiled to have eaten some fabulous steaks in my day. I'm personally a char and sizzling plate kinda gal, which makes me partial to a certain Beverly Hills M****** Steakhouse that just makes it perfection. The steaks at STK were very decent indeed. The taste was spot on -- not too light a flavoring. I had the filet mignon (not bone-in) and it was still very delicious. The cut was soft to the knife, and slightly warm inside. The plate didn't overcook the meat at all. I also tried the skirt steak and the bone-in ribeye. The ribeye was pretty good, but I am a filet girl. The char was not as strong as I would have liked it, but I will take a good flavoring over an over-char. This was a well-cooked and very tasty slab of cow.

The parmesan truffle fries are rectangular 2x4 esque cuts of potato perfectly fried. steamy on the inside and crunchy outside, with parmesan that gave a perfect flavor and just enough truffle oil to me amazing.

The corn pudding was sweet but good. Very smooth. I thought it was mashed potatoes when I first had it.

The vanilla panna cotta was pretty well executed as well -- very soft, and served with nicely complimenting flavors.

OVERALL
I loved my night here. The food was not the best, but it was pretty damn good. Memorable and very nice night out on the town in Hollywood. I wouldn't hesitate to come back and enjoy another meal here.

OTHER TIPS
Go during happy hour if the price tag is keeping you away
Try to find street parking (a little difficult) or bring $9 for valet
Dress code is striclty enforced - no flip flops or beach wear
Go during dineLA -- 3 courses (steak included) for $45 and $14 for 2 drinks add-ons. GREAT DEAL.</text>< pictures>

have been avoiding it for awhile thinking it would be sceney and cheesy. glad we finally went because not only was the food very good, the service was excellent and the whole place was did not have a pretentious vibe at all!  i'm sure fri & saturday nights will be different (we went thursday) and louder with the dj but if you want some delicious food in a beautiful low-lit place, and you like meat, i highly recommend stk.< /Review>

We went to dinner and a club broke out. Loud, obnoxious, and unenjoyabe. The food is unmemorable and for the high price paid should be considerably better.

The service was actually good which earned them an additional star.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>I visited today  (one day after Covid19 opening) with my husband again after picking out a fountain 9 months ago. We Walked  in and asked for a deal. The salesman said "I will meet you outside", then a white woman came in and took to her product, instead helping us. I reminded him that we were there first and we already know what we want to buy. He continued with her anyway. Again I reminded him that we were in the store first. He says "you have bad energy then he refused to help and put us out the store.< /review>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1604430407995, 'text': 'After this review was posted, we were SO terrible that she did come back and bought a fountain with us. When the fountain came in she actually upgraded it. If it were not for her husband who is a good man and a veteran we would not have done business with her. She is a serial complainer and you can see from the other reviews she has made. It is shameful to use the current struggles of equality in our country in an attempt to hurt small business. Insinuateing that we hold bigoted views and assuming our sales associate who is Latino, would treat a woman of another race differently is ridiculous. Everyone who works here is either an immigrant or of mixed racial ancestry. And we invite people of every walk of life to visit us and see for themselves. I, the owner of the business, am of a race that has suffered greatly due to racial injustice, my people have lost millions due to bigotry and hatred. For me I see everyone as American and we wish everyone would see it this way.'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80945ed24751bcf3:0x2d0c30491daa7710</gmap_id></record>

<text>It's a long, sordid story.  Bottom line... numerous delays and excuses, and atrocious customer service.  When we tried to bring our service concerns to the owner, he defended his incompetent staff and actually blamed us for their many delays.  They do not answer the phone, and never got back to us after saying they would.  This happened repeatedly.  I have no idea how this place stays in business.  Many weeks later, we canceled our order.  I was surprised to actually get my deposit back.  Oh, and they offered to not charge sales tax if we paid cash.  Very shady.  Perhaps someone should look into this.  My recommendation is to avoid this place like the plague unless you are the police or tax fraud investigator.

Follow up to owner's comments:

Isn't it interesting how everyone who posts a critical review of this business is a pessimistic, manipulative, evil person who for some reason just wants to pick on poor Eli?  Maybe that's why there are so many negative posts.  He spends his time trying to discredit these honest, accurate reviews rather than doing something about the legitimate complaints.

As far as his "facts" and "truth" - wow!  I'm not sure what orifice he pulled this drivel from, but I'd be careful getting too close to it.  Let's clear things up a bit.

We did not make our purchase from a home show, we visited the showroom on McKinley.  And at no time was my wife there without me.  I do not even know why he felt this info was relevant to his argument, but it is a complete lie.

The owner had no part of the initial order or color selection.  Another 100% lie.  We placed our order with no problem, and happily paid the deposit.  At that time, we were told the order would take 2-4 weeks to complete.  Fine, completely understandable.  Eli, the owner, did not get involved until later when we were informed that they could not fulfill the agreed upon color because their painter had suddenly left the country.  By the way, they did not bother to notify us of this.  We did not find until we finally called to inquire about the status after we had already waited more than 4 weeks.  Only then were we informed of the paint situation.  So, we went back to the showroom, together, to choose another color. We were offered a refund of our deposit at this point, but we wanted our fountain!  We picked a new color and agreed to wait another few weeks, as requested.

There was never a request to upgrade the design, and therefore no discussion about getting the upgrade for a discounted rate.  Another pure lie.

Finally, after more delays beyond the revised time estimate, NO attempt to keep us informed of the delays, and extremely rude behavior that Eli calls "customer service", we decided we'd had enough and asked for our deposit back.  As I mentioned before, we did get it, much to our surprise.

The REAL "facts" and "truth" of the matter are that the business owner told a bunch of lies to cover the incompetence, inexcusable delays, and deplorable customer service of his staff and himself.  Why would I make this up?  My only motivation is to help others avoid a similarly unpleasant situation.  You be the judge.< /text>< Pics>

{'time': 1535054064157, 'text': "In the service of providing fountains and statuary, we always strive to do the very best for our clients. For anyone who has worked retail or dealt directly with the public. You know all too well that some people will never be satisfied with the level of care and attention you give them. In fact they are in a constant struggle to play themselves a victim to secure discounts and or free services. In the twenty years I have been in business I have been manipulated before from people with the most pessimistic attitudes toward the people helping them. And when you own a business from time to time you lose more money than you make on customers. Sadly in an attempt to not deal with that type of customer as to avoid a poor review. One is forced to reply to unfounded allegations. So for anyone who would like to know the facts and the truth regarding the Daniels order with us, here it is:\n\nThe Daniels put a small deposit on a small fountain at the home and garden show. A color would be picked later.\n\nMrs. Daniels at this point is the only one involved. Mr. Daniels only knows from what his wife told him. Mrs Daniels came to the showroom to to pick color and upgrade order.\n\nDESIGN UPGRADE\n\nMrs. Daniels wished to upgrade to larger design. Was not happy that it costs more.\n\nCOLOR SELECTION\nMrs. Daniels was not easy to help select a color for her fountain. I am the owner of the business and I stepped in to help her personally. After showing her all the options we could do for her. She agreed to a color. And left with a strange smug demeanor.\n\nAGREEMENT OF TIME TO COMPLETION\nMrs. Daniels had put a small deposit at the home show. And a couple of weeks later is when she selected a color and upgraded the design. All of our orders will take a minimum of 4-6 weeks. And this was explained. To the only response from Mrs Daniel “We are ready now.”\nAfter explaining that it is first come first serve and at the time we had too many people in front of her to rush her fountain, she still insisted that we hurry. Once again she voiced her dissatisfaction in waiting.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nMy best painter had a family emergency and we lost him he left town,  slowing down production this was the painter who was to paint Mrs. Daniels fountain. (As stated before she was very particular about the color choice.) I decided to avoid having a big problem with this customer,  that the best was to refund the $40 deposit, let her go someplace else.\n\nREFUND AND THANKS\n\nWhen the Daniels came to collect the deposit (only time Mr. Daniels came to the showroom) they were thanked, I apologized we could not help them. That's it. We are just relieved to not have this problematic situation to deal with. And as far as the elaborate story Mr. Daniels tells we can only pray for people like that."}< /Response>

I have done business with the Pot Farm for a long time.  I have purchased pots and a fountain for my home and lots and lots of statuary.  They have always been helpful and courteous.  Their products are high quality and they manufacture most of them right here in Fresno.  I would highly recommend this business. Be weary of all the negative reviews, notice most of them are not from people that even live around here.  How did they have such a bad experience and all around the same time?? Please don't make the mistake of listening to these made up reviews.  No need to try to make a business look horrible because of one bad experience, move on!  =)< /text>

<Text>Great place, I came in with the wife and was helped to find the perfect fountain for the back. We ended up spending way less than we planned and got way more than any other place,  we shopped around for months before coming here. They were professional and we will be going back soon for some pots.</Text></record>

We went to check them out and placed an order for a fountain for him and saved about $550 bucks just by buying from them. If you want a great deal and a huge selection you are at the right place, I'm not sure how they do that but I saw they are making the fountains and benches right there! All other places charge more then twice for almost the same product! So there, Im giving them 5 stars for their unbelievable PRICES!</Review>< pictures>

<review>The employees at the Pot Farm have always been more than acceptionally helpful in every way. The owner has a great sense of humor and his employee Ed is always the best to ask for assistance. Any and all problems I've encountered have been taken care of with the best service. I will return!! Their product is always the best at the lowest prices. You'd be foolish to listen to any of the harrasment stories or go anywhere else!!</review><GmapID>0x80945ed24751bcf3:0x2d0c30491daa7710</GmapID>< Time>

I have been shopping around around for a while and this place had the best prices by far! I have no idea why there are people who would give a bad review!? There was nothing that I experienced that could support any of there horrible reviews.</Text>

Because you came in a car and your husband had a truck. I am the owner of the business, I apologize for my "scruffy hair" I ride a motorcycle. You parked in front of it. I had no employees left in the building and I remember you coming out, you came in two cars. And you stated you just wanted to look around. If you needed a pump I would have sold you one no problem. But you didn\'t mention that or that you came from Merced. We are open 7 days a week and Sundays we usually close early. But would stay open if we had customers. I needed to be at a event and I had just cut my last employee for the day. If you had enlightened me to the facts I could have taken care of your pump. But you simply said you wanted to look around.'}<//response>< Name>

<review>They’re open Saturdays til “3pm”, at least that was what we were told when we called earlier in the morning. We arrived at 2:15pm, just wanting to buy a pump for our fountain and to look around to see what else they offered. The guy with the scruffy hair came out and locked up and said they are closing early since they are slow today. Ok. We literally just drove from Merced to look here, but never mind then. I don’t recommend this place at all for their customer service.</review></record>

Thanks Joseph for your help!</text>< Pics>

Our staff is highly trained in being outgoing and friendly. In our trade making the customer feel like they are home around family is what allows us to offer the level of service we pride ourselves in. We do have at times customers who are shy, it is our duty to get them out of the shell so we can find out what they enjoy, this helps us provide the right product to the right person. Ridiculing someone for any reason, would be the last thing we would want to do since after all we are seeking to provide you with our quality products. It is very serious to hear this. As I am sure you would imagine. If this were true then I urge you to call the office to speak to the owner.

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I called this shop to ask if they were open today as most shops are closed to the public. Immediately, the person who answered replied and said “can I answer the phone if it’s not open?” Then I said, don’t talk to customers in this manner. He proceeded to yell at me, said to get lost, and hung up the phone. Extremely rude!</Review>< Pics>

Rare to find Sri Lankan items.  Helpful recommendations on products upon request. Fair pricing. Lowest cargo service $6 per sf. Went beyond their limits in finding some missing items in Colombo . They were  there from the beginning to the end with their cargo service.  I have used their cargo service several times.</text>

<review>We {THE FAMILY} has been COMING  here for two or three. My Wife is from Sri Lanka. She liked coming here because she found items that came Sri Lanka. but that has changed . She said she will never come here again has long she is alive.. FOR what the owner did to her.to explain.... before the Family went back to Sri Lanka for vacation. My wife wanted to ship  three   big boxes and my Son in Law three boxes too. The owner said it would arrive around  the end of the month. Well it  was  two month late.My son in law was very mad. called the owner to complained. So when boxes finally arrived in SRI LANKA. THEY TO PICK THEM UP. THE OWNER SENT A E-MAIL  TO SHIPPING CLERK. SAYING MY WIFE AND SON IN LAW DID NOT PAY FOR SHIPPING. YES THEY HAD THE RECEIPT. BUT THEY HAD TO PAY AGAIN. MY WIFE CRIED. I have been in the retail business all my live. i have never  heard no owner doing to this to a customer just because the complained.So think twice about shopping here. What  i wrote here today is all true<//review></record></dataset><record>

We buy our Ceylon tea, curry powder, rice and Christmas cake ingredients from here. Best Sri Lankan spices available and the only store in the neighborhood! They ship boxes to Sri Lanka and door to door delivery is available which is convenient. Jude and Liyanage are very helpful and friendly people.  Buy the world's best Ceylon ☕ tea from here 😊<//text>

According to the name, this grocery store hidden in the corner of Pioneer blvd and South Street in predominantly Asian Indian Artesia has become the place for shopping among Sri Lankans’ and South Indians. The store carries freshly imported Sri Lankan fish and the best quality Sri Lankan canned food. To add during weekends they cater freshly made short eats, lunch packets, milk toffees, kottu Rotti, lamprais and many more Sri Lankan dishes. The lamprais, the hybrid version of the Dutch is a major seller at this place. Only limited number is available over the weekend. The lamprais which comes in a oblong box looks from outside just another lunch box but when you open the box the presentation is immaculate with lots to offer.< /text>

<Text>This is my first bathroom-only review of a gas station! This one was pretty good as fas as gas station bathrooms go. Get the key from the friendly attendant and go around the outside. Bathroom was clean and all the facilities worked! Not bad for out-on-the-highway areas of North/Central California. Lots of fast-food options and an AutoZone nearby, so overall not a bad stop-off area for long-distance drivers.

this is no longer Beacon. It has been a  Valero gas station (1 of 2 Valero's in this town) for some time.  There are 2 Valero gas stations in this small town, both are on the same street.  Whether you are entering or leaving  the town from one of only  two exits, you will see a Valero gas station.  This Valero gas station is across the street from McDonald's and next door to Carl's Jr.  The gentlemen that run this gas station are very sweet and attentive. They are very polite and keep the gas station bathrooms very clean and the shop is always well stocked. This Valero gas station also offers propane services. If you need a propane refill you can get it here at a reasonable price. However , don't come here if you need air for your tires because the machine has been out of service for some time (part of the reason why I'm giving it only a 3 STAR rating).< /Review>

<Text>This is somebody's private home. Why is it being treated like a public tourist attraction? They should tone it down and follow the local codes. I'm sure the neighborhood isn't zoned for gaudy eyesores like this - it's not fair to the neighbors.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Unique and certainly a well known landmark this place is a direct reflection of our local culture.. This is a must keep landmark if you are not a Bay Area native please keep your unconstructive opinions to yourself and move to wherever you came from.

Easy to get to, but limited parking. It IS a private residence, so you're limited to viewing from their gate. Great Iconic oddity that this country has had for Decades🙂<//Text>

This place is absolutely THE BEST !
I understand the traffic on the road the house is on is pretty heavy for a dead-end street ~ but the GIFT this place is to the WORLD is worth the inconvenience to the neighbors ~ Cuz the CREATIVITY & bold Humor that are expressed thru this architectural WONDER are epic !

ThankQ to Florence Fang for your courage & fortitude for fending-off town haters & officials ~ they should be ashamed of them selves for trying to CENSOR your spectacular self-expression ~ Go FLO!!< /Text>

I was on an inter-campus shuttle and taking a snap, but accidentally opened my eyes in the middle and saw this little paradise. I was attracted by this colorful place at the first glance and took out my phone to search it on map. I did not know there is a law suit about the house until I saw the reviews. Hope we can keep the house!!
I really wanted to visit it one day :)< /review>

It is indeed a beautiful house on the boring hillside of Hillsborough. Can’t believe the new owner got a lawsuit for such beautiful and creative masterpiece. Drop the suit please! It is breaking a lot hearts! ☹️</text>

<text>It’s really hard to believe that in the Bay Area, the birthplace of the Summer of Love that  the town of Hillsborough  would sue to change this amazing landmark.  Cleary it is an art installation of high caliber,  and makes the commute along Highway 280 sparkle. I have no connection to the  owners of the property,  I just love the smile it brings.

WHY DON’T people who live there and say how wonderful the place is RISE UP against the town of Hillsborough and their horrible lawsuit! If this were next door to me, no matter what the value of my house, I would treasure this unique addition to the neighborhood. I would be the first to support a go fund me page for the homeowner to fight this lawsuit. Horrible that she can’t have her house the way she wants it. Not exactly a shack!</review>

<review>This is a private residence. I was only able to see the backside of the house. Had I known I would not be able to walk around and see the entire house I would not have driven out to see it. I was so disappointed because I saw this and made it my 1st stop of the day.</review>< pictures>

I love this house.  This is not a neighborhood of conformity.   The neighbors baffle me.  I’ll protest to keep it in its current state. I’ve been driving by this house since the 80s.   Drop the egregious law suit.  You neighbors need to worry about your own house !!!!    You can’t see it from the street rather mainly the freeway.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I drive by this house on my way home up 280 and I absolutely love the whimsical nature of what the owner has done to it.  ALWAYS puts a smile on my face when I drive by it.  The owner of the property is being hassled by neighbors in Hillsborough who think that their wealth gives them license to tread on anyone who things differently than they do.  Likely persons whose biggest issue is what they will do next in their exclusive Pilates Class.

Not to mention the cowardly city council of the area who are acting the way they do, kneeling before the 'altar of wealth' and hassling the owner.  Flintstone House we all love ya and despise those who want it taken down.<//review>< pics>

Tell your boring nosy neighbors to lighten up and find something valid to complain about!  It’s your property, it’s clean and tidy, quiet and peaceful.  Nothing special about their homes...best of luck to you and Fred, Barney and Dino!!!< /review>

You can't go inside and you can't really see much from the road. Not worth the trip.</text>

< Review>
The media is making this sounded like the residents of Hillsborough is complaining and protesting this house, we are not. I am a resident of Hillsborough and I can tell you that my neighbors and I love the house. The owner did a fabulous job making the house looks awesome! The only public nuisance here are the Hillsborough city councils. Stop the lawsuit before you get vote out of office!<//Review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Florence you have a lovely house and I don't agree with other neighbors that it should be changed.
In fact, I have no idea what their problem is - the house it's not visible from the street, just from the hill side and it adds more character to the neighborhood.
Don't let some boring people dictate what you should put in your garden. We love you! Yabba dabba dooo!<//text><Name>Matt<//Name></record>

<text>Cool looking i luv. It
I think the city of hillsbourgh
Should drop the law suit
Hell its fantastic its art
Its great !
Life is so short lets enjoy !
The city wants to regulate
Its not what the people want !
They just want to chip chip
Chip chip away at our personnal taste and desire
Freedoms are slowly taken away.....the regulations are
Taken away.. Kids luv this
Its like a fulfilment from
Our past. Its like a fantasy
Should be left alone for people
And kids to enjoy !
Hell i really enjoy it .its something unique.. Enjoy
The city should just leave it alone ! I hope fellow people
In area should not vote for
Them next election.you know
I write a lot of reviews and few
Things bother me.... The act
In which the city of hillsbourgh
Reminds of the united health
Care for seniors Horrible
Pathectic.....both impliment
What they want there is a lot
Of seniors that dont recieve
The respect that they should
Have ! Give support to the
Home owner not the city of
Hills dump I mean hillsbourgh.
I think the local goverment has gone to far..... Society as
A whole luv the flinstone home and yard leave it alone
It cheers me up ! I think its
Great for the community .!< /text>< rating>

(Translated by Google) The house is nice, something curious in design out of the ordinary, it just lacks a gardener to keep it clean

(Translated by Google) Look north on I280 from Silicon Valley to San Francisco International Airport.
Because it is a private house, you can't enter it, but the kids are delighted to see it from the train window!

(Original)
I280をシリコンバレーから北へ、サンフランシスコ国際空港に向かうと右手に見えます。
個人宅なので中には入れませんが、子供たちが車窓から見て大喜びです！<//text>

Great customer service! Was referred by my sister and was the first time I filed taxes. They offered drinks once I walked in, they had a kids play area which was perfect because I had my son with me, bathroom available and goodies at the end. Angelica helped me, she explained the process and was quick. Will be coming back next year.< /text>

This was my first time filing taxes and I had the best experience. Angelica was beyond helpful. As soon as I walked in the door I was welcomed and offered a beverage. This company along with Angelica are super fast and efficient. 10/10 would recommend!<//review>

This is my second year with liberty tax. Angelica was very helpful and she actually did my taxes the previous year. She’s really fast and thorough with her filing. They’re friendly and trustworthy people. I’d still be coming back!<//text>

I came here to get my taxes done and after waiting over an hour, the guy told me he needed to help other people who he claimed "were there first." I saw them come in an HOUR after me. He had originally told me he'd help me right away. Thanks for ruining my first experience filing taxes and wasting almost 2 hours of my Sunday. I left before being seen because I have other things to do on my day off. I'll be doing my taxes somewhere else.

Edit: I went back again the next day after they messaged me and was helped right away. In and out the door in 15 minutes. Satisfied with their response and the subsequent customer service. Thank you.<//text>

<Review>Mishell and her team are professional, transparent, and so helpful. I’m glad I found her office. They provided me with help through out the year even off season when I got a letter from the IRS. I was so nervous but she helped me to respond and get everything sorted out. I couldn’t have done it without her help. I recommend everyone I know to Mishell and her team.</Review>< Pics>

This is my fourth year coming to mishell and I continue to have an incredible experience. There are things I didnt get when doing taxes and Mishell always made sure to explain and address any concerns I have. As a single tax payer one usually doesnt get too much back. But mishell always manages to qualify me on every possible credit that I am eligible for. I am grateful for her service and how she demonstrates to genuinely care to give back the most refunds to her clients, to the best she can.</review>

Mishell, an expert in every sense of the word.
The support I received was exceptional, I had several years without doing my taxes and she supported me to update me. The customer service was what struck me the most. He took the time to explain all my questions and doubts.

Without a doubt Liberty Taxes in Beverly is the best place to do your Taxes.

Thanks Mishell !!

They tell you that you don't have to pay for your taxes because they charge it from the reimbursement and at the end you will pay like $ 300 for your tax preparation. They are going to tell them that they do not have to pay for the preparation of the taxes and that they deduct it from the refund and they do not tell them how much it is, it is only the amount they receive as a refund and in the end the bill for the preparation is like $ 300.

For a company like us that require heavy amount of color printing  it’s been extremely convenient and cost efficient. I would highly recommend them to people or businesses who print a lot. You will save money using their services.< /Review></record>

We've been servicing our office printer needs with ink joy for about 11 years. They are quick to come in and help with filling our ink cartridges and even replacing our printers as soon as they break down. They are very professional and friendly. Highly recommend you speak with Joe!<//Text>

I purchased the wrong product from them listed on *bay with local pickup. It was the hp mfp 477 inkjet, and I was actually looking for the mfp 477 laserjet. They had a used one in stock.  I highly recommend this business as they have repairs, services, and printing products. Thank you guys.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Today I visited InkJoy Printing for the first time. A lady at the front named Eunice was communicative, understanding, and kind. She went above and beyond her regular duties to help me as I struggled to print an important document. I made a mistake and forgot to save a pdf copy of the document before arriving at the store, but she helped me and made it happen.

After I had the document I needed, being the knucklehead I am I even left an important envelop on her desk by accident... She knew I would come back for it and when I arrived, already had it ready! Felt welcomed and made my hectic day bearable!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
This is a company that can be trusted from the owner to the workers. If you need a printing service, a printer service, or a person to chat with. Please stop by let this company know that you are there in need of your wants and needs. They will "kindly and efficiently" lead you the direction. You will feel already in better way and you will end up with a better solution in your hand than ever before. Highly recommended!!!<//Review>

{'time': 1557795866629, 'text': "Mr. Rodriguez. First of all i feel unfortunate and embarrassing for your struggle. Your family came by with the printer and thus we kindly guided your daughter that your item required a replacement for an electric board unit. We had contacted your daughter and your wife several times but none of our call was able to hold of anybody. we attempted to call your family at least 5 times a week and that efforts continued for three weeks. some lucky days, we were able to reach your wife's cell, unfortunately, i couldn't speak Spanish at all and she couldn't understand English. We left several voices mail to your daughters phone, but never got a return call.  When we spoke to your wife though, we had tried to inform her where we called from but she hang up on us several times which we were assuming she could not understand English by all mean. Regardless of all our efforts, you and your family could have come to our shop anytime between our business hour to pick up your printer but you never did. Your hateful comments wouldn't help anybody but creates more issues. If we made a mistake, yes we deserve even lower than one star. But as we had tried a numerous times to get hold of your daughter and wife to get your printer back or fixed, we really don't think we deserve your rating."}</Resp>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) As in Korea, I use it as if I go to a local stationery store and print it. It was so good that I could email it to Inkjoy's email address quickly and it was coated. First of all, it was great because the parking space was large. I entrusted you with the production of business cards, but it turned out very satisfactorily. Next time, I plan to make stickers.

(Original)
한국에서처럼 동네 문방구 가서 프린트 하듯이 이용합니다. 잉크조이 이메일주소로 이메일 보내면 신속하게 가능하고 코팅도 돼서 너무 좋았습니다. 주차공간 넓어서 우선 너무 좋았어요. 명함제작을 맡겼는데 너무 만족스럽게 잘 나왔습니다. 다음번에는 스티커제작도 하려합니다.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It was nice because it was kindly explained and the price was cheaper than the internet. I just needed a printer device, but it was nice to be able to purchase it together. I think it will come often whenever there is something to print or ink is needed in the future. Thank you ^^

친절하게 설명도 잘하시고 가격도 인터넷보다 저렴해서 좋았습니다. 프린터 기기도 마침 필요했는데 같이 구입할수 있어서 좋았네요. 앞으로 프린트할게 있거나 잉크 필여요할때마다 자주 올것 같습니다. 감사합니다 ^^< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It's my first time, and it's very kind, and I was impressed by the fact that you did not dislike it even though you printed a small amount.
They also sell fortress masks, but if you need a mask, please find a lot

처음오는건데 매우 친절하시고, 적은 양을 프린트해주시는건데도 싫은 내색없이 진행해주셔서 감동이었습니다.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Great custumer survice for copying and printing.
Prints quickly and quickly.
We have plenty of parking space and reasonable prices so we use it every time we need to print in LA. I got friendly with the boss! The boss is so nervous that I want to give 5 more stars + 5 more, so I do not like the review very much, and I am using it!

Other staff members are kind and will never regret it! River recommended!

Great custumer survice for copying and printing.
빠르고 신속하게 프린트를 해줍니다.
주차 공간도 넉넉하고 가격도 합리적이어서 LA에서 프린트가 필요할 때마다 이용하고 있습니다.  사장님과 친해졌는데!  사장님이 짱 센스넘치셔서 별 5개 + 5개 더 주고 싶어서 리뷰 잘 안쓰는데,  쓰게되네요!

다른 직원분들도 친절하셔서 절대 후회하지 않으실겁니다!  강 추천!</Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Everything about printing can be solved here.
I also sell a lot of printing related products and have lots of product knowledge so it is cool to explain!
I saw the business card and brochure printed on the other person. The color paper design was very good. The fleece is kind, so the reviews are long ~ ~ ㅋ

프린트에 관한건 다 여기서 해결가능하네요ㅋ
프린트관련 제품도 다양하게 많이 팔고 제품지식도 많으셔서 설명도 시원하네요!
프린트 된 다른사람꺼 명함이랑 팜플렛봤는데 색감 종이 디자인 다 너무 좋더라고요 다음엔 인쇄도 여기서 해도 될듯해요. 싸장님이 친절하셔서 리뷰도 길게~~ㅋㅋ< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>This place was freaking amazing! There was a long wait time(because there were so many people) but the food was absolutely worth it. Not one person had any complaints about. They have perfectly cooked fries and the burgers were off the chains flavorful. Definitely will be returning to try some of the other menu options.<//text>< Pictures>

I got a beef/shrimp/broccoli plate.. And my only complaint is there wasn't very much sauce.. But besides that it was delicious- good portions, seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. I will definitely be going back cause I need ice cream.</Review>

Their consistency in customer service is great and the food has remained good quality for as long as I have lived here.
The menu here has a lot of variety, you would literally have to make this place a regular spot to eat in order to try everything.
Triple A has become a safe fast food for my family. We eat really healthy, so when we do have our splurge days we like to indulge in their teriyaki plates and their famous Triple Burgers on occasion!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x8094609740d211c3:0xc2c02a3f3fd4d490< /gmapID></record>

<review>It's a good place to get burgers with that old Triple A charm. I remember when they opened the place again with new owners.  The burgers taste the same. When I crave a specific taste I go there. Nice to see they have expanded there employee base; a diverse population. I'm impressed.</review>< pics>

<Review>Don't use your bank card, they charged me 5+ dollars to use it and its not posted. This is hidden fees so when they print your receipt it tells you one thing and you bank tells another. Not being petty but damn thats a damn milkshake or something!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x8094609740d211c3:0xc2c02a3f3fd4d490<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

Not the best but not the worst.i used to love going here for the tacos and salsa but I'm not sure what happened. On more the  one occasion did we get rancid salsa. Also twice we got moldy bread, at least they were nice enough to give us an exchange but still we did not buy bread again. The food itself is good but too many iffy times to go again. :(<//review>

This place needs to be shut down.  At least they didn't hesitate to refund my money when I asked for it back.  Only took one bite before i saw the bugs.  Plus eggs were hot,. I asked for sunny side up and the gave me over hard..  The rice, and the beans were cold and old from previous day I believe.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE<//Review>< Pics>

The service was crazy slow
The cooks kept filling to go orders and we were sitting there for an hour and 10 minutes before I even got a dinner salad. When the food finally started to arrive it was cold. Carne asada was cold, beans cold, I think my salad was warmer than the steak 😕. The food was very blan and all around unimpressive. Definitely NOT a good place to eat.</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is located in an excellent place.
So that they can have fresh bread which would increase their demand for this article, all the bread they sell is in a very bad hard or dry condition, which speaks very badly about the trade that is offered to the consumption of private individuals.

(Original)
Esta ubicado en un excelente lugar.
Para que puedan tener pan fresco lo cual les aumentarían la demanda de dicho articulo todo el pan que venden esta en muy mala condición duro o reseco lo cual habla muy mal del comercio que en ese lugar se brinda al consumo de particulares< /Review>

<text>I'm happy I don't have one of my loved ones residing here.
I do, but I didn't pick this graveyard for them. And I'm happy I did not because the grass is always dead, there are fake flowers, and it's unfortunate for such a prestigious memorial site depressing I've never seen a graveyard with a dead lawn. I have complained several times and it's only gotten worse.< /text><rating>1<//rating>< gmap_id>

some of the head stones are sinking, some just disappear into the ground due to the grass growing over them. some of the headstones have been knocked around or over and they are never fixed. some of the decorations have been there for years. it's very sad. this place does not get the care it should.<//Text>

Beautifully maintained cemetery in palo alto. Some of the plots are out in the open, others are in more shaded areas under large trees. Walking around the grounds you get a hint of peoples stories, their history and the history of the country. Its strangely beautiful to see so many generations together, like time progresses there more slowly and 10 generations interact instead of just 3.</text>

It's Martin Luther King day day and we have been waiting several hours for someone to come unlock any of the mausoleums.  We were told security would be here within a half an hour and it's been over an hour now.   Very bad service for those who want to visit their loved ones on a holiday of all days.< /Review>

I am at a loss for words to describe how utterly disrespectful and heartless some of the staff are. No I'm sorry for your loss, no sympathy what so ever. I called to get an explanation of the $4300 cost to open my grandmother's  plot. The cost is literally double anywhere else charges. The explanation I was given was they have rent to pay. I was offered a $400 discount if I did not watch them drop the casket. These people are taking advantage of people in the most vulnerable time. It is disgusting! This should not how people are treated during this time.<//text>

This was once the most lovely and well maintained memorial park, but my visits this week to our family niche was VERY disturbing.  The grounds were over grown with weeds around grave stones, much of the landscaping was dead, and uncared for, and the mausoleum was dirty, and looked like it hadn't been serviced in weeks with dead flowers and dropped petals throughout.  Disrespectful conditions which should not be allowed to continue.< /Text>

Beautiful green cemetery that is quiet even though it is on busy Arastradero Road. I lived across the street, and would walk along the bike path on the south side of the grounds on the way to work every day. It is a lovely, well-cared for, sad place.</review>

<time>1387825779281< /time><Review>I have 3 immediate family members there, so it's a place with a lot of intense memories. My only complaint is that for cremations, they only allow 1 family member to attend. It felt weird to have this major event treated like an administrative detail was weird. I hope they change this.

As for Thomas Fredlik's joke, Gunn does have plenty of future MDs, so I'm sure exploration was been discussed. However, as one of the jr. high and high school students who hung out there sometimes late at night, it was comforting to have ancestors watching over my early experiments in ... never mind. FYI, all the students treated the place with surprising respect.</Review>< pics>

My family has used this cemetery for a while. I do worry about the high-school students from across the street smoking in it, I think they might even start digging up graves, which would be no good. That is a responsibility of the school though.</Review>

<review>Well I recommended and have to say this dispensary didn’t let down. When I went it was very quiet and low key. Then Jessica comes out the door to walk us back and her customer service was exceptional. She even laughed at my corny self when I cracked a joke. I will be back to see you Jessica thank you< /review>< Gmap_id>

I had a great experience from start to end. I was in the front for a few minutes. So the guy in the front desk said come on back, I'll help you. Everyone else must be busy. Can't remember your name, sorry. He was right about there house prerolls. It does have a punch. The girl was right. I should have switched prerolls. LOL! Good times guys and I will be back. I'll bring my pup next time.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I have been using this pharmacy since COVID-19 has started and I am so happy with the service. I usually get drive up or delivery. Pat usually answers the phone and takes my order and he is very knowledgeable with their products. They carry name brand buds  that are tested and that’s all I buy. He also delivers and he’s the best. He gets to my house within the hour of my order and I live about 8 miles from the pharmacy. Definitely recommend</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I went in looking for a good smoke for a great buy. I asked to see a particular strain when Linda recommended a better bang for buck. Once I got home I was super satisfied. Thanks Linda :)< /review>

This is my favorite dispensary! I literally go at least once a week. The staff here is so friendly and knowledgeable. They have great daily deals and always having fun promos for their customers.

Most importantly they stand with the black community, and they give back to the neighborhood. They have so many options for pickup and delivery.

If I could give them 10 stars I would!< /Review>

Hey google family so I visited this shop about a week and a half ago couple days before my birthday. Came in looking for hash and they did not have any😕. But what they did have was super awesome customer service. I didn’t feel rushed at all. Didn’t want to leave felt comfortable like home. Henry and the pretty lady coworker they were so knowledgeable. I ended up leaving a really happy customer. Thank you, you guys and gals!!😉😁🤟🏽</Text>

The Happiest Place on Earth... forget Disney!
I LOVE Leaf and Lion! I came to California on a birthday vacation from Texas and I couldn’t have asked for a better first (and second!) experience! Jessica was incredible and so, so knowledgeable. She really took the time to make sure we got every last thing we were looking for at the best price she could manage for us! Every member of the staff that we met made us feel so welcome and took the time to suggest cool places to hang out or go catch a great view and overall just make our experience absolutely amazing. This will always be a stop I’ll make time for when I’m here on a visit! Thank y’all at L&L so much for making my trip so enjoyable!
If y’all ever get a chance to stop by and see them, by all means DO IT. You won’t regret it!

P.S. Please remember to be respectful of the property and the properties surrounding the clinic... It is a residential neighborhood!< /text>

I was so stressed to go to another dispensary that might rush me. We came in and was welcomed at the front with the nicest guy. Then we were greeted and everyone answered my questions, gave cool info about products I didn't know about. Hands down best experience ever and will be visiting again!</Text>

Wonderful customer service, wonderful environment. Since moving here from NY to California it has been difficult finding a shop that makes me feel comfortable purchasing CBD, but this shop does the job and I always recommend this place to anyone because of the great prices and the great deals they are always having.

<review>Great customer service. We were greeted right when we walked in. Easy to spot their location. Parking is a bit difficult but there’s lot of street parking on the cross street.

Definitely my new go to spot !!!</review>< Pics>

This spot has some bomb weed, my friends go here a lot so I’ve always heard about this place. I finally decided to give it a try myself. It’s super low key! It also gives me steel craft vibes haha< /Review>

Great service and a legit business! Some people may complain because of the different taxes they have to charge, but I'd rather pay the extra taxes and make sure I'm getting quality products than risk going to a place that isn't ran legitimately.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and they also offer a veteran discount!<//review>

This place is great.  Their location is off the beaten path, but easy to find, and everyone working there is super friendly.  Good deals, nice people, and a really clean, welcoming environment.  Finding out this place was so close to where I'm staying was a lifesaver.</Text>

IF I COULD GIVE THEM 10 STARS I WOULD!
Leaf and Lion was my favorite dispensary out of the 3 dispensaries I went to. My friend and I are from out of state so we planned on doing quite a bit of activities revolved around weed.
Jessica helped us out and that girl new her green. She really made us feel at home and was so patient with us. Jessica and all the staff were giving us suggestions about places to go and see. They even hooked us up with some free bags/sunglasses/stash bag. We’ll be planning another trip back in the future and Leaf and Lion will definitely be our first stop. If you are in Long Beach, CA area make sure to check them out.<//text>

I’m from out of state, but when I saw such great reviews I knew I had to check this place out! First time going into a dispensary and the staff was incredibly nice I forgot the name of the lady who helped me but she was amazing! I ended up getting Camino infused gummies and man 10/10 every one of my friends and myself agree these are the best gummies ever. Really wish I lived in Cali so I could get more!!!!!< /Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>One of the best dispensaries around town, on top of the fact that it is legal-- it is of best interest to get high-quality, controlled, regulated, products from bud tenders who have actual knowledge regarding the products being sold to; instead of the typical shop that can be found locally, where most people are trying to get a quick buck. 100% recommend!< /Text>< name>

<review>They have Raw Garden for $30 a half which is great and cheap and such a bomb cart. They have an array of flowers . Different farms too, so I like that it’s not the regular strains the other shops have . And also such affordable prices. They have Great CBD products and patches as well. 5% off for being a student , plus 5% for early bird and u can stack the discounts with their daily deals . 🔥< /review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been here a handful of times, I totally dig this shop, I use to stock up in LA, before I found this place. It’s clean, great variety of products for different needs/preferences. The staff is friendly, and it’s a welcoming environment imo.<//Review>

Quality of products and customer services are pretty great-  the selection of products as well are pretty high quality.  Highly recommend it-  also some people complains about parking, but I've never experience it.</text>

(Translated by Google) Addict store. But everything is very civil. Rayonchik so-so. They conduct courses on the conduct of such a business. The usefulness of the courses is dubious and aimed rather at attracting personnel to your own store. Of the 6-hour course of useful information, there were 20 minutes.

(Original)
Наркоманский магазин. Но очень цивильно все. Райончик так себе. Проводят курсы по ведению подобного бизнеса. Полезность курсов сомнительная и направленная скорее на привлечение кадров в свой же магазин. Из 6-ти часового курса полезной информации было минут на 20.</text>
