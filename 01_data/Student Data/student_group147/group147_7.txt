Never open, but they leave themselves open on food apps, makes no sense. I've succeeded at getting food from this place twice in seven attempts.
Edit: place has been open a lot more consistently, the place has great food</Text>

<text>Not the best place for high quality Vietnamese food. Bought a bbqpork over rice, the pork did not taste traditional at all. In addition they overdid on the rice portion and did not give any fish sauce for the rice. Banh mi is horrible. The bread they used is not French baguette. It’s super low quality and filled with flour. You pay for what you get i guess<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I'll not from town and happened to pass through, I looked up some Asian food joints on Google and decided to come here based on some positive feedback and reviews and let me tell ya folks, it does not disappoint. The food was amazing! Customer service was incredible and the small, humble family owned and operated atmosphere simply compliments an incredible experience.

Definitely come check this place out guys, you will not regret a fantastic, deliciously  flavorful meal, and even better, it's not even that expensive. I would come back time and time again and would advise everyone to do the same.< /Review>< rate>

I decided to try out a different Pho restaurant and order some Pho from this place. there's mediocre and there's good pho. the pho i got from this restaurant was just awful. The broth is bland and taste like water. The broth didn't even have a beef taste at all. I didn't eat most of the Pho.. Easily the worst Pho i've ever had.< /Review>

<Review>This is hands-down the best Vietnamese food I've ever had. It's super high quality absolutely delicious and it's even better than Bay Area quality Vietnamese food. The portions are huge and I never get a headache from MSG. I worked at Saigon Grill in Lodi for 5 years
(during their prime). I've never been able to find Vietnamese food with that high of quality and large portions besides Saigon Grill until this place. But it's actually even better. I would recommend their grilled shrimp spring rolls, pho tai, and  seafood egg noodle soup. We are lucky to have this place in Stockton you have to try it!!!

<text>Under staffed, not very clean, basil is wilted and not fresh. Didn't get a cup of water for about 15 mins, but what do you expect from Stockton!  The rice noodles are a wide flat rice noodles and wasn't a fan. The beef was ok but there wasn't to much of it in the pho. The broth was good enough. Was cheap so there's that I guess. Overall I'd have to try something else on the menu to really give the place a 4 star.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

This is my first time, I havent tried my order yet but is a little turn off when is your first time, and the owner or whoever he is, is very rude he looks like his already having a bad day. That's not professional when you have first time guest. Maybe that's his personality but was hoping for better response.< /text>

I went here and ordered the Pho Dac Biet. They only have one size bowl, so I got extra noodles because I was really hungry.

I got my food really quickly and was pleased with the amount of beef they threw in there.

Unfortunately, an emergency occurred and I had to step away for a considerable time. When I came back, the server had already taken my barely eaten first bowl, started a brand new bowl, and brought it to me piping hot. I thought this was customer service at it's best. They could have left me with a cold bowl of soup, but they cared enough to make sure I enjoyed their food.

The steak was cooked well and one type was fairly thick. I can't say I've ever seen  steak this thick before in Pho Dac Biet, but it was tender and fell apart at the touch of my chop sticks.

Ultimately, I really enjoyed this meal and the excellent service the server provided to me. I'm going to come back here again for sure.< /text>

Food is ok... Got the shrimp pho and blended bubblegum drink. However as soon as we got in, one of the ladies there appeared rude and she was. All i said was ordering for to-go and she gave attitude. Then the cashier tells me how much it was but told me incorrect amount. I asked for my receipt and the rude lady throws hand in air and yells no receipt.<//Text>

The bowls were very large, the broth had plenty of five spice in it, and the vegetables were fine.The biggest surprise was that rather than the thin rice noodles usually served with pho, this place uses wide noodles that they get fresh made from Turlock.  If you're in Stockton and want some soup I highly recommend this place.< /review>

<text>Amazing food but sub-par service.  The need more help.  Only one server no matter how busy.  20+ minute waits each for taking the order and getting the check.  If you have the time the food and portions are more than worth it.  If they had an additional server then 6 stars.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The P1 here is no joke. Most pho places give you alot of broth with little meat and noodles. Not here! Everything is huge Chuck's of meats and it's so damn good. I get so full off a bowl I could barely walk! You definitely get your money's worth. Highly recommend if your in downtown Stockton!< /Text>

This, for me, is that place. I had the pho noodle soup and in an age where powder broths are all the rage, it's good to find a place that still cooks it the old fashion way. We enjoyed the food and even though the service was a bit... informal, it's a cozy little place we don't mind visiting again and again.</Review><username>Sam Lo<//username>< date>

The sandwiches there are absolutely amazing. My favorite is the beef sandwich. So flavorful. I've only been here three times so far, but every time has been consistently delicious. I'm trying the Pho on my next visit. The vermicelli and chicken with lettuce was also way good. Very good place to eat.<//Text>

<text>As I’ve said before, I love Vietnamese food, but for this restaurant, I find the broth was not up to par. You could go to get packaged broth ingredients from a store and put together a better tasting broth. Something was just missing in the recipe. Service was just-ok as well. I will not return. Hopefully they will improve the broth. It either makes or destroys your food; it basically ruined the entire meal, and my order was rather large.< /text>< pictures>

<review>So far, its the one I like so far in Stockton - still trying out others.
The staff is very friendly and always checking on you to see if all is ok.
Best to go during daylight hours or with a group though.  In a little rough end of town.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>This has become our go-to spot for pho. While it may look a little daunting from the outside as it’s under a motel the food is VERY good. They offer a large selection on their menu and everything I’ve eaten has been delicious. The staff is welcoming and their prices are great.

My go to order here is the combination pho and the grilled pork spring rolls. The Vietnamese coffee and Thai iced tea is really good as well.

Parking is limited but I’ve never had a problem finding a spot and once you’re inside you can seat yourself for dine in. They have a lot of people coming through, if you’re in a rush you can order take-out. I love that they have little caramels at the cash wrap for a little post meal dessert too.<//Review>< GmapID>

This was my first time going and ordering Vietnamese food. They were very helpful. I went for my daughter who knows the menu and what it should taste like. She was very satisfied and so was my grandaughter who order a strawberry drink with boba. It was very busy in there, so, that was a good sign for me. I hesitated cause of location, but, it is a good little spot to get some good Pho'.</text>

Fast service but a little rude, food is too oily and salty but it tastes good.  The leftovers will be very fragrant so keep that in mind if you'll need to bring it inside the office.<//text>

Ate here for the first time Saturday 10/21/2017.  It was a fantastic experience.

Firstly, it was a Saturday around midday so there weren't too many patrons inside.  Please don't let the adjoined building ward you off!  When you walk in you're greeted to a personal atmosphere that has room for 19 with space enough to be comfortable.

I ordered the E1 pho, which came with thinly sliced beef, pork nuggets, tripe, and a generous helping of two large pieces of tendon, on top of the traditional onion, chive, cilantro, etc.  Thai Basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, and lime served on the side to add to your liking, as well as Hoisin, Sriracha and a variety of other sauces.

Each of the meats, were cooked very well.  The beef was extremely tender, the pork was flavorful and not gamey, the tripe was clean with no grit whatsoever.  The broth it came in was fantastic.  It was spiced well, an even mix of flavors that complemented the mix of vegetables and meats within.  Personally, I only placed a few leaves of Thai Basil, and dumped quite a bit of sprouts in.

One thing I did want to draw attention to on it's own was the pieces of tendon within the bowl.  Often times, it's easy to cook tendon and be done with it, the results still being slightly chewy...this was not the case.  The tendon was cooked throughout to practically fall apart, but it was easily able to be handled into the mouth with chopsticks and simply melt from there.

The noodles had good flavor, with a good portion size proportionate to the very generous serving of the pho itself.

To note, I tasted the broth, meats, vegetables, BEFORE adding only about a Tbsp of Sriracha.

Fountain drinks are offered.

Don't let the location or the adjoining building scare you off from enjoying this gem hidden in downtown Stockton!< /Text>

Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service the lady who was supposed to be the server was very rude . I had to ask for condiments several times before getting it . Once I got my food I didn’t like so I told Her I wasn’t going to eat it but I’ll pay anyway . She proceeded to yell at me saying “ well you order it , that’s your fault “ she was so busy yelling she wasn’t even hearing that I was saying I’m still paying for it . So rude I will never return</text>

<Review>I'm so glad this place is still open! Best ice cream in the Valley! Their food is delicious, especially the fries and burritos. Will be coming here more often. So sad that they closed the El Centro, and Calexico Foster's Freeze ): but super happy that this one is still in business! 🍟🍔🍦💕< /Review>< rating>

Love this place, one of the first things I got introduced to when I moved here. Sadly everytime I order I wait forever. I feel like even if I'm the first to order in line, my order is made last. It should be first come first serve but whatever.</text>

This place never disappoints. I always go for their ice cream. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. They never slack off on the ingredients. They also have good food. Love their fried burritos.</review>

Been coming here for years and have made the trip to this place for no other reason than to come here.

Coming back from Glamis or heading there from Truck haven - I would recommend</review>

<Text>The girl working was rude and made me two taquitos that were sad with no cheese barely a smidgen and no sauce it's the first time I didn't like the food there. I've been going there for fifty years  I paid $23 for hamburgers fries sodas and taquitos. The only thing that was really good was the onion rings perfect. But her attitude was bad and I knew my food wouldn't be so good this time before I even got it< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80d75a68648ed1df:0x15e2b3c712097287<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I used to lpooove lime slushees from Fosters. I went there while visiting Cali and they had all the flavors EXCEPT lime. So after seeing butterscotch covered cones in the window, I decided to get that instead. They didn't have that either. So I just got a chocolate dipped cone, paid and waited. When my order arrived, I got a chocolate milkshake because the dipping chocolate was chunky.</text>

<text>Best in the business! Paul came to my home and build me a new sliding screen door, build a new window screen and re-screened an existing door screen and I'm beyond satisfied with the quality. Extremely professional. Called the day of to confirm a let me know when he was on his way. His prices are extremely reasonable and I would highly recommend his services to anyone.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

<text>Paul Davis returned my call immediately. He set up same day service. Called to let me know his arrival time. Quoted me a fair price. Was neat friendly and completed the repair of two oversize screen doors in a timely manner.

<Text>Paul,
Was a great person to do business with. He did 3 new screens for me. He used heavy duty screen materials and did a perfect job.  He made his appointment on time and did 100% of what he said he would do. I’m so happy I did not go low bid. I had a price $350.00 less than Paul, and I’m so happy I went with the Mobile Screen Shop In Menifee Ca.
I now have the best screens I ever have had. His products are not the same as what you buy at your local hardware supply or home center.
I highly recommended Paul.<//Text>< Pics>

First time coming here, ordered 4 pupusas to-go, each with a different filling. I ordered in Spanish because I speak it but they had a bilingual menu. I waited about 12-15 minutes and my order was ready. Being my first time here didn't realize the pupusas are actually made to order! They came out hot, with coleslaw and sauce on the side. I went home and ate them, sooo good! Super delicious. Will be coming back again.

UPDATE: Have been coming here for over a year, and the quality of the pupusas is consistently DELICIOUS. Thank you!</Text>

Pupusas are the reason to come here. They are very good with generous amounts of fillings and cheese, everything else is bland and under seasoned.   Ambiance is non existent. Docked 2 stars because the highly advertised lunch special was not honored more than once.. "Service in 5 minutes or its free"
Only one other couple was there so there is no excuse really. Could really use a deep cleaning. Not for the faint of heart or adventuresome</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This pupuseria is tucked away behind other businesses; if you are not a local, you may miss it.  Do not miss it.  The food is unfailingly fresh, the menu diverse and the cheese in the papusas is all warm and melty.  They make the pupusas to order, so either call ahead or be ready to kick back in this casual eatery.

I had the shrimp papusa and the mushroom papusa and both filled me up, for sure. There are so many varieties of papusas on the menu; they even make spinach papusas.  The menu includes other Salvadorean food and Mexican food as well.  The staff are welcoming and seem to enjoy their jobs!  Oh.  They also have pastries!< /Review>< Pictures>

They make your pupusas fresh. So to save you the time they encourage you to call ahead to place your order.</text>

<Response>None<//Response><Pics>None<//Pics><text>My husband and I decided to try this establishment out while on vacation in July 2017. There was only one family in the restaurant, which had already been served. The rest of the place was empty. We were informed that they had several phone orders to prepare and that they would have our food out in about 20 minutes. My husband asked if they could turn off the tv, which was emitting a loud static sound and had no picture. The waitress said she would turn it off, but didn't. We waited 45 minutes for our order, only to be told it would be 15 minutes longer (when my husband got up to check on the order). We were never even served beverages. We just sat there with a 4 year old and a 2 year old, trying to keep them calm and waiting for food that (apparently) was never prepared. During that time not a single customer arrived to pick up a phone order and only one other customer came to eat in the restaurant (and was served promptly). We were very displeased and offended by the lack of respect and service.</text><userid>117920351050934651959<//userid></record>

This place takes for ever to give you your food. We called to make an order. They had told us that if we wanted to make it faster to call ahead and order  ( they told us that the last time we went prior to this one) and that the order would be ready when we got there. Well, we called at 12:25 PM. We only ordered 2 pupusas combos and an order of pastelitos. They said give us 25 min. We got there a little early so me and my bf went to the 99 cent store in the same shopping center. By the time we got there our order should've been ready to serve instead they still made us wait, they kept saying it was coming. By 1:17pm, the waitress only brought us an order of pupusas and said the rest needed few more min. We waited for 5 more min and nothing. So we left and we will never go back to that place ever.< /Review>

Service was excellent! Very personable waitress and very helpful! Hush puppies are a must. Don't know why this hasn't caught on out west. They are topped w bleu cheese and bacon. Fried green tomatoes were so-so, breading did not stick. Ordered the ahi tuna, superb. Took a bite of pulled pork sandwich and greens. Sandwich topped w slaw and pepper jack, made for a good spin on s classic sandwich. Manhattan was delish to drink! A little on the pricey side for drinks, but will be back<//review>

<Text>The restaurant was empty and we still waited a long time to have food served. Everything was bland in flavor: food, salsa, smoothie. The pupusas lacked the additional fillings (beans, chicharron, peppers). The smoothie was made way after we finished eating.

I had to go up to to the counter to ask for the bill, but the lady was more interested in chatting with a friend at a table. When she came back to the counter she obviously forgot about my request for the bill.

She could tell I was frustrated with the overall wait and service, and told me to call it in next time.

Icing on the cake: I learned the hard way that their menus are not up to date on pricing. Even after the pricing was explained, they still couldn't justify overcharging me. They kept blaming the tax, and I was definitely charged for an extra (unknown) item even after I added everything up even with the price changes they explained.

Never again.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Good food, but sometimes they take a looooong time to serve you. Anddddd that's because they're making the pupusas. So that's normal. Highly recommended. You can get 3 pupusas and a drink for 6.99$! Do I need to say more..?........ You still reading this!? Go and eat pupusas!</Review>

The worst pupusas and yuca con chicharron I've ever had! The masa tastes old and spoiled and the yuca way too fried, nothing tasted fresh. My advice is to not spend your money on food that isn't worth!<//text>

(Translated by Google) Bad service they tell you it's 20 minutes, they make you wait almost an hour then they don't give what you ask and you need something because you trust them to put everything on you and you lack the Coca Cola, fork they put that on me, nor do I use it 👎👎👎

Mal servicio te dicen que son 20 minutos te hacen esperar casi una hora luego no dan lo que pides y te hace falta algo porque uno es confiado a que te pongan todo y te falta la Coca Cola, tenedor me pusieron yo eso ni lo ocupo 👎👎👎👎<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad hope in this challenge, the truth is that they have to expect healthiness, the bathroom, I looked at two cockroaches, and well, that says a lot to do, because they treat you well and more, but hygiene, soon, fence health.

(Translated by Google) PESIMO SERVICIO, (if you are thinking of going to this place, stop !!! DO NOT DO IT !!! In my personal experience it was unpleasant to wait 45 minutes for a breakfast to arrive at my table, adding that I asked for a coffee, which, I get to the end of which my meal was finished !!! I really do not recommend this place !!

Definitely try the fried oysters! I am usually disappointed when they don't have katsu breading, but these were very good and refreshingly different. Light, savory and a bit spicy.< /text>

Ordered about 5 different rolls for the table total. 2 were awesome (firecracker and Philly roll), one was good (spicy tuna deep fried), and the other two were so "meh" in taste that they were unmemorable.</text>

<Review>If you want a nice place to relax and enjoy your sushi. This is the place. Host was very friendly. I found some Japanese beers here where you can't find anywhere else.

I've been coming here regularly for years as it's in my neighborhood. The casual atmosphere, very friendly staff, and of course, great food always draw me back. There is very little wait for tables and the service is consistently efficient and quick, making this place my Go-To spot for awesome sushi.</Text>

I'm not sure why others are so generous with the review on this place. I had the sashimi, roll, tempura, katsu, specials and etc and I can say that the most fundamental basics were off from the beginning. For example, soy sauce is not the right kind you should be using for sushi and has strong salty taste without the flavor of soy at the end, wasabi was bland and hardly had the kick, miso soup was diluted and sugary. Even if it's a budget sushi place I didn't feel that I was getting good bang for the buck. I would say this place is on par with qaulity of mall food court sushi but the condiments on the side worsens the experience and ginger isn't strong enough to reset the taste buds. Just having the basics right would bring the quality up a bit if they cared.</review>

Get the Groupon. Especially with a promo code, in which case you'll save quite a bit. I still ended up being fat and paying $40, but you can do better than me. I believe in you. In your restraint. Good sushi!< /Text>

The arrogance of poor communication on top of consistently being late with to go orders is enough for me to never go back. There are enough wonderful people in this city creating beautiful dishes in atmospheres where the soul and human spirit are encouraged and engaging.

As a psychologist, and to be fair, the socio-emotional development in human relations across cultures is lacking. But the explicit arrogance of mediocrity and rude behavior does not lend itself to professionalism.< /Text>

great value for the price, especially for a Japanese joint. decent quality, very nondescript location. definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for Japanese (not just sushi either) and very hungry. bring an appetite. you'll need it!</Text>

Good fat sashimi slices, tasty California roll and dynamite roll. Prices are justifiable. Deducted 1 star because I found a bone in one of my fish slices which has never happened to me before. Another star deducted for sub-par service and seating.<//text>

<review>Great selection of small plates like pork belly, yakitori, cucumber rolls and more. Food was all very tasty and the sashimi bowl is very fresh. Great beer and sake selection as well. Reasonably priced and tasty makes it a spot for definite repeat business. Try their bacon wrapped mochi. It was an interesting and flavorful choice.</review>< response>

<Text>So so worst of tonkatsu curry , I never tasted that worst  tonkatsu before ! That tonkatsu so thin and inside meat so hard not fresh and the Outside skin so thick so I think they made the tonkatsu and put into the freezer when we order  that took out from the freezer put into the microwave warn up and deep fry ！ ooo ! My god! And akedashi tofu no mashed radish and mashed ginger on top the tofu , I just saw the dry seaweed around the tofu! What’s that! And some sushi need to put the mashed ginger on top!  They really don’t know what is the edomae sushi! Because our friends have long time didn’t eat the sushi but I been Japan before! So please don’t deceived us! I should gave no star!!</Text><gmapID>0x8085871610f10945:0xe620de90947d7922<//gmapID></record>

I only had the veggie option and was ill all night. Maybe it was an isolated incident or maybe they put animal oils on their "veggie" meals. For someone who hasn't eaten meat or fish for nearly a decade, the consequences can be uncomfortable.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Went with my bf last night for some sashimi regular, sushi and fried soft shell crab, despite the great presentation, both our stomachs were upset after and we both had to keep turns using the restroom. The sashimi wasn't fresh enough.

Staff were also talking loudly in Cantonese to the cooks. We will not return as we question the freshness of the seafood.< /review>

Randomly came upon Arashi Sushi House on Chrsitmas Day as we were desperately trying to find something opened without a long wait. LUCKY US! Stepping into the clean, soft lighting of the newly painted and tastefully simple decor done with a touch of class drew us in for more. The service was great as they were kind and patient with us spending an enormous amount of time trying to decide bringing edamame on the house as we scanned the menu.  Presentation was lovely as expected with Japanese dishes. Between the three of us we decided on Tempura Udon, Chicken Udon, Unagi Don and a "White Out" sushi roll that was ladened with Hamachi and Walu! Would definetly order the same again when we return (not IF!) We were told they have only been opened for 2 months which would explain the "street view" photo. Don't let outside appearances fool you. The prices were also a nice surprise. There are sports TV screens high above on the walls to satisfy those that may need a break from conversation!<//text>

<Review>Bye Bye Rockin' Crawfish
Hi Arashi Sushi House

Arashi Sushi House took over the location of where Rockin' Crawfish use to be. Like many sushi restaurants in the Richmond district, this is another addition to the neighborhood.

Arashi has an extensive menu. Lunch specials. Cold and hot appetizers. Salad. Sushi rolls. Entrees and even ramen! Dessert and sake. Happy Hour - Monday thru Friday 5pm-8pm.

Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar) was delicious and perfectly cooked. The sashimi was simply fresh. The rice on the sushi rolls were a bit too soft and soggy.

The Whole Fish Sashimi (Black Sea Bream) was the best of it all! The fish was cut thinly and beautifully presented and plated. The fish not only looked picture worthy, but tasted fresh too! It came with fresh wasabi and 3 dipping sauces. I didn't know that fresh wasabi didn't taste as spicy as regular wasabi.

The service was superb! Our waters and tea was refilled constantly. Since we ordered a lot of dishes, they were nice enough to move the small table next to us to combine it into one long table so we would have more space.

I'll be back to try the other items on their menu!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) It's a waste of a star.
The best taste is pickled and green tea.
The crab meat roll was made to eat, but it was melted, but the sushi was not made with sashimi
I'm sorry for the Westerners who are lining up to eat this.

(Original)
별 한개도 아깝다.
가장 맛있는게 절인 생각과 녹차정도..
게살롤은 먹을만 했지만, 녹이다만 회와 제대로 간도 안한 밥으로 만든 초밥..
이거 먹으려고 줄서있는 서양분들에게 미안한 마음이 든다.< /text>

(Translated by Google) The woman is nice but the guys are rude. What is happening with Asians? Any Asian restaurant manners are bad. Despite that, the meal was superb. The maguro, saba, roll of Lion King, Rock n Roll were tasty. Nevertheless, I recommend. Go for it !

La femme est gentille mais les mecs sont impolis. Qu'est-ce qui passe avec les asiatiques ?  N'importe lequel restaurant asiatique les manières sont mauvaises.  Malgré ça, le repas était superbe.

Sehr gutes, frisches Sushi. Tolle Auswahl an japanischen Gerichten. Sehr freundliche und dennoch zurückhaltende Bedienungen. Nicht ganz billig, aber das ist es wert.</Review>< pics>

I love Vampire Penguin. Being from Utah, our family had no idea what to expect. For all we knew it was just a snow cone. Boy were we wrong! It is such a unique texture and was definitely worth our time. They have unique flavors such as s'moreos and Tuxedo. It is like a cold cake with cool flavors and textures. This place is worth your time.< /text>

Yet, You Can Make Your Own Treat So It's Not Like You're Not Able To Recreate Something You Tried Before That Might Not Be On The Menu... I Recommend Trying Something New Everytime You Go Visit.

The Employees are nice and the shaved ice is good an a wonderful surprise if it's something you haven't tried before.<//Text>< user_id>

Saw the big ad while headed south bound on the 101 and immediately had to pull over... LOVE Vampire Penguin!! I've been to the Sacramento location and this one is much bigger with friendly vibes inside. Shaved snow is a trendy dessert that is great year round... it's also an Instagramable alternative to ice cream and doesn't leave you in a food coma.

We did a build your own with half Thai tea, half coffee snow topped with Oreos and condensed milk. The Oreos are just the perfect pop of texture with the snow. Large is the right size for 2 to share, it's worth the few extra dollars more.

If you're driving through Eureka and craving something sweet, definitely hit this place up!<//text>

Had a great first experience here. The employee was very nice and was excited to share what Vapire Peguin and shaved snow was about.  My fiance got Mexican Candy while I got Almond Joy. Both were flavorful and delicious. Definitely a place to visit if you are looking for a sweet treat.<//Review>

I had the strawberry cheesecake, and it was pricey ($9! For a dessert!) BUT it was delicious and super refreshing on this random hot day we had. It was really big too, although it isn't like ice cream where you get really full, it's very light. Still, I would share it in the future, I just really wants to try that flavor. I rated 5 because the taste and service was really great, however its expensive so it's not an everyday (or even every week) kind of thing.< /review>

This is a very strange and unusual place even for Eureka. Vampire Penguin. I would say that they sucked the heat right out of me 👹 I believe it's safe to say brain freeze is on the menu 🤯
Nevertheless the place is popular with locals. They have a very wide range of specialty ice concoctions. Absolutely without a doubt the place to be on a hot summer day. Friendly staff that is very knowledgeable and will help you with any creation of your desire.  so if you dare; then welcome to the Vampire Penguin, you can check in but you will not check out without one of the two above events happening before you do 😅🤯😱< /review>

Very unique dessert to build your own way. If you're looking for ice cream that is not what they serve it is snow. We shared a chocolate with strawberries and strawberry boba. Not heavy at all.</review>

Yum! Their shaved ice stays super cold throughout the dining time you are there and the presentation is awesome! We go here as a special treat as often as we can. Seasonal flavors keep the variety rotational as well.<//Review>

<name>Jeff Hans< /name><Review>This place would get the full five stars but my issue is with prices. This place charges an absolute mint for their frozen water sugar mountains.

Lets say youre financially well off and want some dessert. This is the place. Fancy fancy fancy options and for the most part all taste amazing. I come here maybe once or twice a year as a "treat yo self" moment. But if I'm goin with the kids to get a ice cream etc ill assuredly go elsewhere due to the prices.</Review><GmapID>0x54d400080cd31065:0xb77af34c26813996<//GmapID><rate>4<//rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

I was actully kinda surprised with how much I enjoyed this place. We orderd the huge strawberry cheesecake one and were completely in love with their presentation. It was GORGEOUS! almost too beautiful to eat 😉almost lol. It was very yummy! The fruit was fresh and ripe, the cheese cake gram cracker crust dusting made it perfect. It wasnt over the top sweet either- something my husband appreciated because he doesn't really care for sweets. We will deffinitly be back for another one of these ❤<//Text>

I was sitting there working on my laptop. The waitress asked me to leave, saying that it is a family oriented restaurant, I was there too long, and she did not know what I was doing. I wonder what kind of threat I was perceived as, especially when she did not know what I was doing. Starbucks do not ask customers to leave until the very minute they close. This is unacceptable.<//Review>

Friendly service, tasty dessert, but I prefer regular shave ice. This is shaven so finely that it's more air than substance. Try splitting one in half for the kids to share and it practically disappears before through taken a single bite. Fun to try once, but not really worth the nearly $30 for four smalls again.<//Review>

LOVED IT! Clean environment and friendly staff. Delicious shaved ice has an amazing snow-like texture. There is something delicious for kids and adults to enjoy, Huge selection of flavors from fruity to exotic like Thai tea or taro . I liked it as much as my kids did and since we were visiting the coast for a few days we made sure we hit this place 2x before heading home!<//Text>

<Text>Do yourself a favor and try this place. Someone tried to explain it to be beforehand. There's no way to do it justice by calling it an shaved ice dessert. Just try it once and you'll be hooked.<//Text>< pictures>

This place is amazing. I thought it was just another shaved ice place and I couldn’t have been wrong. On our first visit we asked for their recommendations. Strawberry cheesecake and Smoreos. We ordered both and weren’t disappointed. We were already planning a second visit before we left. Our next visit we ordered dulce de Leche and snowtiger. Again both were amazing.

Please expand to the valley I can’t be driving 6 plus hours just to come back. Although it would be worth it.<//Review>

Most beautiful desserts using shaved ice as the base you can add fresh fruit, crunchy and sauces. I recommend one of their Special creations.< /review>

Make sure you have a good meal before you go there it is not filling it is super finally shaved ice flavored "shaved snow" so it is not filling at all but it is very tasty so eat something beforehand and stopping for dessert<//review>

< Review>
The presentation of food is very good. My visiting family thought this was an interesting place and liked the food.
I thought the food tasted okay, but was too pricey for me to return unless we have visitors again. However, I'd be open to trying smaller/cheaper portions. I thought the marshmallows tasted strange (maybe they were vegan or something).
I like the mascot and the involvement Vampire Penguin has with the community, e.g. donating gift cards to Eureka Trash Bash volunteers.< /Review>

We got the strawberry cheesecake (def go for the delux it was well worth it!), a Mexican Candy, Morning Dew, Almond Joy and Coffee Crush. Also got a few Thai Teas (boba was on point for sure!) and 2 Taiyaki Ice cream cones! Wow what a special treat! We had a big group and the employees were very accommodating with us. Everyone was blown away with the artful demonstration of the snow, taste was just incredible ... like magical ice cream but better and less filling. The fish shaped ice cream cones were delicious and so pretty it was sad to eat them haha 🐠🍦! For sure this place hits the sweet spot and we will come back when we visit!

So, my husband and I both ordered a chicken super burrito. I honestly thought it was going to be good when the cashier let me know what was inside but I was so wrong. The burrito was a very big flour tortilla, it was filled with too much onion, Pico de Gallo, guacamole and lettuce. It has a little bit of rice, a little bit of sour cream a little bit of beans and hardly any chicken. The sauce on top was cold and it was so gross. I had eaten here before and the wet burrito was good but I don't know if they changed owner or what but now it's nasty. And to top it off we paid 9.50 per burrito and it wasn't even worth it. Never eating here again 🤢🤮< /Review>

It took like 30 mins for food that had no flavor. They look under staffed and this lady with an employee shirt kept walking in and out the side door with her kid on a bike sometimes riding around the parking lot by himself looked so dangerous. Not coming back.</review>

<text>There's no greater team than Mary, Daniel, and Thomas.  They have come through for us (I AM Movement) time and again.  From setting up our ring to getting us kitted out with gear, we benefit from their expertise.  Added bonus--they're gregarious too.  That makes them fun to do business with.  That's a win to me.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Came in to get a heavy bag for some training at home. I had a pretty eventful time while at the shop, and got a great deal on the bag. Would highly recommend this place to anyone doing boxing or any other combat sports. Huge selection and awesome staff. Easy go-to for anything you need. Shout out to Dan for the top notch service 👍</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>American made products and locally run by real people who care. I was looking to get a punching bag for my home and wanted to support a small business and find something that was Made in the USA, I came across the FIGHT SHOP online and was pleased with the selection of american made PROLAST items and decided to purchase a heavy bag and a set of puzzle mats. Unfortunately in my zeal to order I didn't realize I had ordered a youth-size bag instead of an adult one. But, never fear, Dan noticed this and called me to confirm and after discussing what I needed/wanted adjusted my order to ensure I got exactly what I needed. None of these massive online retailers can offer that kind of service, I can't express how delighted I am I chose to go this route as I would have been incredibly disappointed to not find this out until it showed up at my house. It was worth the price, including the shipping as it had to be sent cross-country via frieght. I highly recommend the FIGHT SHOP to anyone in the market for training, MMA, boxing gear--high quality product and high quality customer service. Thanks Dan and the rest of the team! I'll be back.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVYlGl_nw1c3L9Nx2acULe9iQTpmHILBpO-U-G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2d3da9fcd576b:0xdfe95971e4581a78< /gmapID></record>

Mary and Daniel are awesome! I highly recommend supporting this family-owned business. They're super knowledgeable and have a wide selection of equipment at great prices. Totally worth the drive from South OC .</review>

I love that this place is family-run and that I'm able to support the local business! Everyone was really genuine and super helpful, did not feel like they were trying to up sale us. In terms of gear, they have an insane collection of brand name stuff as well as their own 'ProLast' ones. All their own gear is made in house, you can actually see them work their magic (cut the fabric, stuff the heavy bag... etc). Everything seems to be really legit quality! I just got the heavy bag and accessories delivered (took less than 5 min to setup), haven't had the chance to try it out yet but super excited to do so. Definitely will be back for more goodies (way more than I need)! So far, I can not recommend this place enough!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Excellent customer service! I placed an online order for a bag and gloves. The bag shipped right away, but the gloves did not. The gloves ended up being out of stock. I called the shop and I was given an upgraded set of gloves instead. These guys are great, highly recommended.<//Review>< gmapID>

<username>Ismael Soto< /username><Text>Lots of gear. All types of quality.. But the pricing is where it goes south. Very expensive. I bought some boxing shoes the guy gives me a 100 price which is fair I added 3 mouth guards and some hand wraps I didn't ask for prices on the mouth guard but the wraps were 6$ my total was 210. I got home to look up the mouth guards thinking they might of been top notch but I saw at the most they were 10 dollars each online.. I try to support local businesses but this was far too expensive.. Do not come with a budget here...< /Text>< time>

<Review>Hands down my favorite place for all my "sporting goods" needs.  Sports basement has great - seriously fantastic - deals on most of their items.  I have been shopping here for years. And whenever I am back in the City and I need a sports bra or I want to try running in compression shorts, I come to Sports Basement!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I went in with my family to purchase a pair of Cleto Reyes gloves with other accessories and we had a very terrible experience with the cashier Mary from Whittier location. She was very rude and short with us, she ignored our questions and I had to ask her twice for her help. She was on her phone and kept busy ignoring us with other things while we were trying to order product from her to purchase. It was our first time visiting and we spent total $260 for good product, but received very poor and terrible service. She made us feel uncomfortable and not welcomed in the store. We won’t be visiting that location anymore because it’s not worth the purchase to receive that kind of service.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt3XSHglxd0PDUkHStLDJVtGvgMG7oUkTMNUn-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>I bought some fighting brand  gloves from them as well as some combat gloves and a chiral mouthpiece. The person who helped us was very helpful a gave us good advice for us as beginners as to which ounces to get for our sparring gloves. Me and my friend went together and got gloves I believe my gloves we 5$ off retail which is phenomenal. Looking to go back and buy some head gear soon. Great experience overall< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

REVISiON:  customer service took care of us today. I wish yesterday's experience had not happened but you should not tank a company on one person. I wish our bag had been like the photo - maybe the manufacturer had a bad day? We might order again when the one we wanted to trade for is back in stock. Make sure to review return policy prior to purchase. It is tighter than typical for 2020.

Original review: I wish we would have received the service everyone else did. We received a heavy bag that looked nothing like the photo and then were just condescendingly told we just were upset because we picked the wrong bag. I wish there was a way to share the photos here. I shared them on our SM sites. They did offer to replace if we paid to ship back (we had already paid $50 in shipping). We should have stuck with Ringside.</review>

<Text>Never do an online business with them, ever! They are insanely TERRIBLE! I ordered NIKE HyperKO boxing shoes in White & Royal color but received another color WITHOUT any confirmation at all. Then I called them and the agent talked in a cocky and impatient way, saying that just an accident and never apologized. Then I got a shipping label to ship it back to get a refund. The agent told me once they received it would take up to 5 days to process my refund. Now it has been 8 days but the refund process has not even started! Emailed them on their business hours but never replied! I  WOULD GIVE YOU ZERO STAR IF I COULD!< /Text>< userid>

<text>This is a one stop fight shop!  I been coming here for years for gear for myself as well as my students.  Their prices are unbeatable and Thomas and David are always willing to help you out.  Their knowledge is great and will let you shop and hang around for hours without you feeling like you are a burden.  From muay thai, BJJ, boxing, mma; they got you covered.
If you're in the area please take my advice and pay them a visit and tell them Frank sent you.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I Don't believe these other reviews are real, the guy was on his phone most of the time and he tried to sell me some really cheap pads for nearly double what they usually go for, and when i did buy something there was no receipt or anything official, i just gave him the money and left. Very strange and not even sure that is legal.<//Review><user>117883991900435380293< /user><pictures>None< /pictures>< Name>

<text>When I walked in, the guy who seemed to be running the store was on the phone with a friend and it took him about 10 minutes to even aknowlege I was there. He had some nice gear but I was mainly in there for some heavybag boxing gloves but the ones he had were overpriced, not to mention he had very limited selection on name brands. I was expecting some kind of deal for the boxing gloves he did have but not even any price tags on anything. If you don't know anything about boxing and it was your first time buying gloves you would probably get ripped off because he had a lot of no name gear that I'm sure With regular use wouldn't last longer then a month. he had some skinny kid working for him that wasn't even doing anything but walking around even though the place was a mess with random gear stacked in piles in certain areas. I came in just to see what the prices were like and as soon as he realized that, he just walked away and I told him he had a lot of stuff, and then asked where he came from and if he had a store before somewhere else and he replied, "From Japan" and him and that kid started laughing. So I just left the store. Now I know why no one goes there.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This is the best AutoZone I've ever been to.  The employees are so helpful and will even help you with minor work such as changing wiper blades etc.  My dad has been coming here for years and only comes to this store due to the excellent value added service provided by the employees.  This location provides great customer service not merely a place to buy parts.  Customer Service is what builds your business, more locations should model themselves after this one.</text>

They like to close early at least 15 before the time on their door. I got to the store at 10:50 Just to exchange a part and the manager said they had closed the register at 10:45, when they are supposed to close at 11 pm....<//text>

People are friendly and knowledgeable for the most part but on weekend or if they get some sort of rush it can take up to 20 mins just to buy something or get a part..ive been there when there are 2 people behind the counter and 10-15 people just waiting in line.< /text>

Left a battery today from a 2017 Hyundai Elantra. Picked it up to find out they didn't even charge it. Old man at the front desk was acting like an a hole and now they are putting me on hold or not answering the phone. Please fire this man today.< /review>

I cringe everytime I need to replace a worn out part.  They treat customers bad.  God forbid if I have to return a part because they like to  decline a refund , ignoring their return policy.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Fortunately, there was no long waiting line that they are used to letting accumulate. It's stressful to watch employees act sneaky when the line is huge. I don't see the cause of having to wait so long to bring them our money, when there are other auto parts. Perhaps for being the closest to our home.

(Original)
Afortunadamente, no hubo grande fila de espera a lo ellos están acostumbrados dejar acumular. Es estresante ver a los empleados hacerse los disimulados cuando la línea es enorme. No veo la causa de tener que esperar tanto para traerles nuestro dinero, cuando existen otras auto partes. Tal vez por ser la más cercana a nuestro hogar.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I recently had to replace carpet in one room of a former home. Frank at Cole’s was incredibly helpful and patient in my search for a match to the existing carpet, and understanding of my need to keep costs down! I was impressed with the ease and speed of scheduling measurements and installation. Nikki was helpful, responsive, and even offered an early installation. Joe and David, the installers, were polite and efficient, and cleaned everything up nicely. I’ve shopped with Cole’s in the past, and this positive experience means I’ll continue to do so in the future. I’m very pleased with Cole’s selection and service, and I give them my highest recommendation!<//text>

Everything about our experience with Coles was first class!  Our sales person, Trevor, was friendly, listened to what we wanted  and was very knowledgeable.  He was also honest about how long it would take for the installation to begin.  When the installers (Tony and Jesus)arrived they were amazing!  They managed to remove all the furniture to lay the carpet and replace it when they were through!  This was not an easy task in our condo, but they did it and never lost their smiles!  They were very professional and
did a wonderful job in laying the carpet!  We could not be happier and will recommend them every chance we get!<//text>

We purchased the exact same carpet from a different store and saved in excess of $4,000 compared to the price Coles was offering the carpet for.

That is over 27% less just by going to a different flooring company in the same area.  The installation from the other company was great and the carpet looks wonderful.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1614795578809, 'text': 'Response from the owner-We thank you for the feedback on your experience here at Coles. Our system shows that we provided multiple quotes with different options and dollar amounts back in September of last year. We offer a variety of products at a variety of price points. We always strive to present our clients with the best value that meets their needs. We would have been happy to look at the carpet you selected elsewhere and provide a quote to compare and see if there was anything that could have been done to bridge that gap. We are glad you ended up getting your project squared away and we hope to be considered by you again in the future.'}<//resp>< gmapID>

Trevor was very helpful and got several samples for us to get at home. We went with another vendor whose bid was well below Coles. I did not appreciate Coles a la carts pricing with furniture moving and piano. The charge would have been $225 plus $95 to move 3 pieces of larger furniture and move a console piano 10 feet. It took the installers we used 5 minutes each move.< /Review>

<Text>We found ourselves in the situation of having to match and track down our flooring that was no longer available from the company with whom we originally purchased our floor. Maryann from Coles was amazing! Although they were located out of town, she went out of her way to help us find the pieces we needed, shipped the product directly to our home, and we have since installed the new planks. They’re beautiful. Coles communication was over the top with calls, messages, emails, and letters. We highly recommend Cole’s Fine Flooring.<//Text>< Pics>

Had a very good experience while trying to look for a carpet color that would match other rooms in my parents house. Trevor was the gentleman who helped me. Very knowledgeable, very friendly, and was great making calls to make sure I got what I needed in a very timely manner! Would highly recommend them, and I know we will be returning customers!< /review>

<text>During the sales process the promise of customer first was shared as a priority of Coles but was not the experience had. Installation was done poorly and a lot of issues caused by lack of communication from Coles Sales to Installer teams. Lack of clear communication was probably the main reason for such a horrible experience and cause for a lot of the frustration with Coles. It took a lot of complaining and arguing to finally get a manager involved who is doing his best to remedy the situation but a month later after the initial install date and still waiting for Coles to complete what should have been considered a very easy project. So no surprise I do not recommend Coles and would say you are better off avoiding them.< /text>< Pics>

My experience with Coles was wonderful. Starting with walking into the store, working with Ron Stewart who greeted me with a friendly attitude and guided me with information I needed to get the best choice for carpet I wanted.
This all was followed up with prompt service in measuring the area in my house, ordering and receiving the carpet and within 4 days, David came and,  installed it. The job was perfect!!
A perfect, affordable company!!</Review>

We went into Coles on a Monday morning needing carpet on short notice for a recently purchased house.  They sent someone out that afternoon to measure and set-up the appointment to install the carpet on Friday.  Great customer service and will definetely use them again.</text>

Outstanding service, wide selection of sturdy flooring. The installation was quick and respectful of my home.  I have used them for over a decade both for business and home.  I highly recommend Coles.</review>

Denise, my saleswoman was a consummate professional with a penchant for design. She knows her carpet inventory, styles and colors to match my home decor. Denise promptly returns phone calls and emails. Communication is quintessential.

George was my carpet installer. He serviced my home with prior orders. George is a perfectionist. Make sure you request George for a carpet install.

Some friends would say why buy  at Coles when you can save money and get a similar carpet at Lowe’s or Home Depot. No way, no way. A customer will not get the same service at Lowe’s or HD as you would at Coles. You are working with one salesperson at Coles who knows you and your order, not some rotating employee who works  in the plumbing dept. during the day and carpets at night.

I’ve used Coles on previous orders with high customer satisfaction. We want to support Coles and keep them in business!!!

Working with Coles for my flooring was one of the worst experiences I’ve had in my home remodel. The process of remodeling is quite stressful and they sure add my stress by 10 folds. Before signing the contract with them, they made promises to have the work completed and called me 10 times a day to sign the contract and pay the deposit. As soon as they collected the deposit and turned down my other bids, everything went south...from ordering the material, to scheduling the install, the quality of the installation and not having enough material to finish the job on time. Working with Coles has been a nightmare...they charge more than any other flooring company and they provide poor service and quality.< /Text>

I placed a small order for vinyl laminate flooring by phone with Cindy at Cole's.  Cindy quoted me a good price and ordered it as it was not in stock.  She showed me the transition choices for my selection by e-mail and kept me informed by  phone, text, and email.  I felt like I was treated like a VIP even though my order was small.  Even the warehouse man who loaded my car with the product was very pleasant and polite.  All in all my purchase with Cole's  was a pleasant experience and they exceeded my expectations.<//Review>

We are totally happy with the Coles Fine Flooring team. The sales person was knowledgeable & courteous always answering questions & concerns in a timely manner.

Cindy was a joy to work with.  She is knowledgeable, very supportive, fun, looks for ways to work up a good package for us, a real treat.  She patiently helped us through several visits to help us come up with the right carpet and tile for us.  We highly recommend her.  We know from past experience Coles has good quality products and installation.

Coles Fine Flooring is amazing. This is the second time we have had them install all the carpet in our house. Picking out carpet for a large house can be daunting as it is such a huge investment that you have to look at every day!  Maryanne was fabulous and directed us to the perfect choice for our home. She was very patient and spent a lot of time with us. She also helped us with options that would save money.  We thoroughly enjoyed working with her and would definately recommend her to anyone purchasing flooring. Not only is she exceptionally knowledgeable she is fun to work with!!  Adolpho and Reese did our installation. We couldn’t have asked for more professional, conscientious installers. They did a terrific job for us and we have asked that they be the installers on the second phase of this project. Best wishes for happy carpet choosing!< /Text>

Salesperson was not very helpful and ended up getting my order wrong. As a Designer it was a very frustrating experience and lucky for me my client was gracious about the mistake. The carpet I chose was very expensive and looks lovely in the room we put it in but doubtful that I will go back there to shop in the future...<//Text>

<text>About 3 years ago, our hot water heater burst. We needed to replace our flooring ASAP.Initially, I didn't consider Coles Fine Flooring because I assumed it would be out of my price range. After spending countless days going to the Big Box stores & trying to navigate footage, prices etc. I decided to try Coles, & am so glad I did! Ron Collins patiently helped me, really listening to what I was looking for. He made it an easy experience & I received nothing but compliments for my laminate floor. Unbelievably, we recently had to move & I immediately contacted Ron Collins at Coles for flooring for our new house. It was the same exact experience! Ron is a true professional & he explains everything clearly & is honest. He works with your budget. I highly recommend Ron Collins at Coles San Marcos!</text>< Pics>

We had a hardwood floor installed in our master bedroom and closet. Cindy really knows what she's doing. Her detailed knowledge of the materials and every step of the process gave me confidence that we had made a good choice. The installers were excellent and super fast. We will certainly be talking to them for our next project.< /text>

<Text>Cindy at Coles Fine Flooring is the best! She helped me look for vinyl flooring and carpet. I did get the carpet at Coles and Cindy was extremely helpful, informative and caring throughout the whole process. I had problems with the guy that came out to measure, since his measurements were incorrect. The carpeting team that came out were excellent and fixed the mistakes and did a great job! I will definately go back when I need more flooring!<//Text>< Resp>

Cindy was an amazing sales lady, she assisted me in finding the perfect carpet for my new home and even helped me color match the carpet with the paint color. She was flexible and made sure everything was convenient with my time schedule and the moving process. Cindy is Amazing!!🤗</review>

I inherited a condo last October in San Diego.    Living in Washington state, I'm not able to get to the condo and take care of things as if I lived there.  On one trip to the condo, we went to Cole's to pick out flooring and were greeted by Les. He immediately took us under his wing and never left our side through the process of total new flooring.  He has been the most amazing person to work with.  He's helped me long distance take care of things and I just can't say enough "good" about him and Cole's.  They, especially Les, have gone way above and beyond what I could have ever hoped for.  Think I was saved from a nervous breakdown with all the personalized help.  10 stars for this great flooring compa<//Review>

< Review>
For our flooring needs (carpet and hardwood flooring) my husband I have been working with Jeremy Fratt for a few years now.   Jeremy is just fabulous.  He is knowledgeable, professional and courteous while working with us.    When someone asked me about recommendations for flooring needs - I tell them to go to Jeremy.
I have been please with Coles Fine Flooring not only because of the person (Jeremy Fratt)  who helps me choose and sales me the flooring but also in the installation of the flooring.  I just had my carpet installed.  The installers were just wonderful.  What a beautiful job they did.   They were also very professional, knowledgeable and friendly.
No need to look any further if you need flooring done - call Jeremy Fratt who is located at the Coles Fine Flooring store in San Marcos.</Review>

Bought a custom rug pad. Cindy the sales woman was nice. When the pad was presented to me to was very dirty. She said the technition cut it on the dirty floor. She said it could easily be cleaned at home. Not happy I  asked for them to recut it. She readily agreed. It took a long time. I suspect instead of recutting it they just cleaned it. Expect more when I'm paying $50 for a mat and from Coles</Text>

I can't imagine a more informed or imaginative flooring expert than Jeremy, and the installation by Sean Hazlegrove and his team was spectacular. It was a pleasure to work with such experienced professionals who have an incredible sense of pride in the services they are providing. A conscientious and respectful attitude, and excellent overall customer service skills add to the winning formula.

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Worst carpet or contracting business I have ever used.  EXTREMELY overpriced.  Please shop around before purchasing here.  You can find the same products almost ANYWHERE for less money.  Most carpet stores include the price of installation in the price of the carpet.  But Coles charges separately for installation, $2,000 or more, in addition to the price of their overpriced carpet.  I paid $8000 to have carpet and an upgraded Tiffany carpet installed in my home.  The Tiffany carpet smelled extremely toxic no matter how much I aired out my home. The pad was making my family sick with headaches.  Coles of course denied there was anything wrong with the pad, and after two months of back and forth they finally replaced the padding at MY cost,  $4,000 for new padding and installation fee all over again.  When I asked to be credited for the padding which made my family sick for two months, I finally spoke to Lauren Cole, the business owner.  She was the nastiest, rudest person I have ever spoken to.  She denied that the padding made my family sick (even though everybody’s symptoms disappeared after it was removed from my home).  She immediately demanded my credit card info and threatened to put a lien on my house.  Disgusting.  I expected so much more from a family business.  Please take your business elsewhere, these people do not care about their customers, they only care about how much money they can make from you.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1540486348882, 'text': 'Your original complaint immediately after installation was that there were "stains" all over the carpet. Our inspector Vito informed you that they were not stains, they were footprints. You then contacted us 2 weeks later saying that the carpet smelled and was making your family have headaches. We sent our inspector to your home again and he smelled nothing. We had the remainder of the roll used in your home at out warehouse and could smell nothing. We have installed this carpet for the last few years and it is one of our top selling products. We have installed over 100,000 square feet of this carpet in hundreds of homes. The Tiffany pad is our top pad and is installed in about 90% of our carpet installations. We install hundreds of thousands of square feet of Tiffany Pad annually and have done so for many years. Out of all of these installations of this pad or this carpet we have had no other claims other than yours of the product making people ill. We have this pad and carpet installed in every single one of our showrooms where we all spend 40 hours a week. It is installed in every single manager\'s office and in the owner\'s office too. If there was something dangerous about this product we wouldn\'t be selling it and we wouldn\'t be exposing ourselves to it.\nColes has a very generous One Year Customer Satisfaction Replacement Warranty. When a customer is not happy with the floor covering that they selected we allow them to reselect. Coles covers the cost of the floor covering up to the same price paid. The customer is responsible for labor and any upgrade should they choose something more expensive than the original product. You elected to take advantage of this warranty. You signed a contract for this replacement. This was not for only new pad and labor as you claim in your complaint. You choose to upgrade to a new more expensive carpet as well.\nYou spoke to Jeremy Fratt (Store Manager), Dezarai Gonzales (Customer Service Manager) and Lauren Coles (Sales Manager) and you claimed that all of us were rude to you. We all listened to your claims and tried to explain why they are unfounded. We do not feel it is rude to collect money from a customer that is owed to us and clearly stated in a signed contract. You threatened to each of us that you were going to give us bad reviews if we did not waive the balance owed of $3311.00 for your new carpet and pad. There are many review platforms that are available to you as a consumer and it is your right to air your grievances anywhere you choose. You have done so on multiple platforms so far. We have a phenomenal reputation and thankfully we have the ability to show our side of the situation and leave it for future potential customers to consider the validity of your claims on their own.\nColes has too much integrity and pride in our reputation to pay people to review us favorably or waive their balances owed in order to not receive a bad review. We feel that to do so would be dishonest and a general bad business practice. We informed you that we will be placing a lien on your home and will pursue this through court if you continue to refuse to pay the balance of your signed contract. These are not threats; we are informing you of the process that not paying your bill will result in. We do hope that you reconsider the situation and decide to pay your balance before we need to move forward with the lien and lawsuit. It is in your benefit to do so because having to go to this extent will only increase the amount owed for interest and legal fees.\nPlease contact either Dezarai Gonzales (Customer Service Supervisor) or Lauren Coles (Sales Manager) at 619-276-5140 if you would like to discuss this further.'}</Resp>

All COVID policies were followed to the letter. They ensured that drop-cloths were used in order to minimize debris from getting on the floors or appliances. They also cleaned all work areas, without a fault. They answered any questions that I had and explained themselves in such a, "user-friendly" manner, that was easy for me to comprehend. Nothing was broken or scratched before, during and after the installation process. I am very happy with the project and most of all, pleased with the workmanship that Robert and Angel displayed. These gentlemen should be highly recommended whenever a work order is required to get done. Thank you.</Text>< pics>

While this company was not the least expensive bid, Their customer service and quality of services was unsurpassed from all other companies. Everyone from Dave who came out to give me the estimate, to Susie who helped me with the paper work and financing. Then the crew, James and Alex, efficient, kind, respectful, funny, just a fantastic company with great employees. It really shows that this business is doing it right.< /review>

< review>
In the 5 years that I have lived in my SF valley home, I have had my AC and furnace die on me. Mike and his team gave me a great deal on new HVAC system, and 2 years later the furnace. I work in the construction industry, and confirmed quality installation and equipment. They paid attention to the little things too, which carries over in my experience. So Cal did maintenance, and the technician Dave recommended improving the duct intakes and filter system. Cannot wait for my home to be colder than a polar bear's toenails this summer.< /review>

The guys who came out to do the install were "about their business."

But what really sold me, two starts of the company Mike the owner who spoke with me and answered my questions and to get me financed.  And the Marvelous Jet!  She was so awesome!

<review>The whole process took longer than I thought it would, but at the end of it, it was apparent to me that I had engaged the right company. Their people are competent, knowledgeable and hardworking. You really cannot ask of more than that.
The price was more than the lowest quote and lower than the highest quote i got. Just like in the rest of life, you get what you pay for. I would use them again and highly recommend So Cal Climate Control. I am no trust fund baby, I had only enough money to do this one time only. I prayed about this as I do all major decisions; for me it was the right choice at the right time.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1618859837821, 'text': 'Hey Mark!

<rating>1<//rating><Review>This company used a third party company to work in my home without my consent. The agreement and contract was directly with SoCal Climate Control, not with a third party company. I was not aware of this until the company supposedly completed the AC & Heating installation and it was horrible.  The work was entirely unprofessional and there were so many mistakes and corrections.  It has taken so many weeks for the company to address the corrections. In addition, customer service is also rude and unprofessional.  I do not recommend this company.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c29d23ca6d56c1:0x2b3dcf7916794cc3<//gmapID></record>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Had a decently good experience with the company itself and an excellent experience with technician Fernando Vasquez who performed the primary   evaluation of our system and provided an estimate. Fernando and his assistant Angel were very open to our questions and communicative over the phone, which we very much appreciated. They are the type of people you see as honest and trustworthy. Unfortunately, Mr. Vasquez was not available to install/repair our heating unit on Friday March 5th, so the company sent over another technician whom we were not familiar with. This secondary technician and his assistant were quite frankly rude, did not formally introduce themselves (we don't even recall their actual names), and did not present themselves as helpful in any way. I hope the rest of the company does not work the way this man does. The primary technician seemed like he was rushing the entire time, did not seem invested in the project at all, which makes us question the quality of his work. He was dismissive and demeaning of our questions, especially regarding the details on setting our new thermostat... which now looking back was likely was not programmed/set correctly considering the massive fluctuations in temperature on the daily. We were considering doing further repairs with this company, but this man made us truly reconsider. Hopefully the other employees are as great as Fernando, and not the technician we received upon the second visit.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I posted a more lengthy review on yelp. Long story short, paid $1800.00 for duct replacement that was done so poorly, I hired a new company to replace the ducting installed by SoCal Climate control. Do yourselves a favor folks, if you need duct replacement, go with someone else and get quality work. Cannot speak to their other services.</review>< pics>

<text>So far we are enjoying our new AC unit and really don't feel the Bakersfield heat! Mike was great and prices were very competitive for a brand new Trane. Just make sure you request a permit prior to signing any agreement.  So Cal did come through at the end. By far the better company of the other 3 I received quotes from. I had a few issues but Mike took care of them...overall a good company!

Editied....Sorry I gave 4 stars. Mike is good and installers are good but the women Bryanna and some other woman are the worst. I  am accused of being a liar and told that a lien will be put on the equipment.  I owe a balance of $1200 and withheld it until the city inspection was passed.  Inspector came out about 3 weeks ago with one of their workers and it didn't pass. I was waiting for another inspection and last week called the guy who came out the first time. I let him know that I would be returning to work and wanted to know when they'll be out again.  He told me at that time that I wouldn't have to be home because they could come in through the side gate. Just now I received an email from Bryanna asking when will be a good time for her to set up an appointment for the inspection.  I replied that I'm off at 5 and she responded that unfortunately it would have to be before that time. I called to explain my situation and that I was told I wouldn't have to be home for the inspection ( everything that needs inspection is outside). That's when she began yelling and I yelled back then I terminated the call. I called back to advise her I'd be available this Friday as I return back to work on Monday.  The woman who answered that call called me a liar and that I was something else. The total was a little over $11k and I owe $1200 or so. They are accusing me of not wanting to pay. But the reason for the balance is because an inspection was never ordered and I was told several times by SoCal that it's my responsibility to get one. All of this would have been paid if it was all done correctly.  I didn't know I had to order or I would have made sure to schedule an inspection ASAP. By biggest pet peave are liars...I'm not a liar. I'm just a consumer trying to get the best deal and everything done correctly.  So if any of SoCal Climate workers are reading this please respond and do what you must do.  I will be calling the city myself tomorrow to rectify this matter. As soon as it passes you'll receive your balance.

Thanks< /text></record>

<text>Wonderful company! From the moment they came to give us a bid for their services to the last minute they were here. Very professional, knowledgeable, and genuine. You will not spend any money you don’t need to spend, they are honest about the work your home needs done, but also honor whatever services you’d like to have done. They respond quickly, and promptly.  We had our vents/registers cleaned, old ducts removed, & new ones installed, they took care of the whole process leaving nothing behind. Charles and his crew were great! Respectful, professional, and always on time. Would highly recommend.< /text></record>

SoCal Climate Control was one of three businesses who was willing to install a mini split A/C system I purchased. Most companies require you to buy and install through them for warranty reasons, which I understand. I received a quick estimate and then after having my electric panel upgraded (for solar) called them for installation. Lance and his partner were very professional and clean. He kept me updated on the work progress. The work was estimated to be two days, but ended up being three, which was fine as I bought a foreign system to them and they had to figure it out. I bought a ceiling mount system. Everything was installed cleanly and professionally. I expected the cost to go above the estimate for extra needed materials, but it did not. I would definitely use this company again for any A/C needs.< /text>

<Review>They were very responsive and quick to act.  The $35 fee was welll worth the piece of mind to me.  They did try to say we needed a duct cleaning for $1800 more.  I didn't agree with that so I got a second opinion from Econo West. Econo West stated no cleaning required and nothing was wrong with the system... but we might want to consider a $380 replacement of capacitors .  So in the end, I would use SoCal Climate as one of two-three estimates for certain.< /Review>< user>

<text>The company was terrific to work with. Customer service is very responsive, and the guys who installed the furnace were super polite, quick, and left everything very clean. They also had to cut a large hole in my plaster wall to install a return, and did so very carefully and skillfully.  I would definitely recommend them.<//text></record>

Landon C. HVAC  Project Manager with SoCal Climate Control came to our home to review and give us an estimate on what what needed to be done to our AC. Which just happened to stop working the week it was 90 degrees plus. Landon explained being  an older unit it would not be cost effective. Our unit required R22 refrigerate, which as of 2020 no longer  is being manufactured. He was very through in explaining our options and the cost factors. My husband and I agreed time for a new AC. After  reviewing with Landon we decided that the Trane TL8X1 Central Furance and TR14 Condenser (up to 16 SEER) would be the best value for what we needed in our home. The following Monday it was installed. The two technicians Joseph R. and Aris were on time, friendly and their workmanship was top quality.  They removed the old HVAC units and installed the new. They were very organized and neat. Before leaving Joseph gave us a quick tutorial on our new thermostat. Extremely pleased with the entire project from start to finish. We highly recommend SoCal Climate Control.</text>

<text>I had nothing but excellent service with this company.  They were extremely accommodating to all my questions on the mini split AC units and were very patient with my "research" inquires.  Its alot of money to spend so I wanted to make sure I understood what I was buying.  The sales rep "Reece" was very professional, on time, knowledgeable and accommodating.  The AC installers were great.  Did the job in 1.5 days. They were very organized, polite, kept their masks on and walked us through how to use the system.   We also had insulation put in our attic.  The installation guys were on time, came right in and prepped the area and were in and out in about an hour.  Both were very polite, kept masks on and cleaned up all the area.  We are enjoying the AC .  I highly recommend this company.  Mike, the owner is great and follows up on all inquiries..thanks everyone.< /text>< username>

I was pleased with the foreman on the job. I believe his name was Liam. He had very good communication skills and explained things well, showed me what he was doing and progress and any issues. The team also did a good job calling me when they arrived and left - to ask permission to use the bathroom inside, etc. They always wore masks when working inside. So far so good and the product works!  Only reason why I’m not giving a 5 is I didn’t appreciate the communication style of the first tech who came by. Also, I was told the product was in stock and ready to go in time for our install, only for it not to be. They did work hard to move things and make it happen, adjusting the teams’ hours to work around our time needs - they ended up finishing the job into the night. Which we appreciated.</review>

Do not use this company.There work is very unprofessional and of poor quality. We had a simple install of a mini split done in few hours (rushed). They obviously don’t know what they’re doing since it didn’t pass inspection twice. I tried calling multiple times and no one responds. We are still waiting for corrections for our final inspection and they won’t fix it, we are left on our own. We had previous work done by another company (Southland) on our main house and they were the exact opposite (professional & quality work), so we know a lemon when we see one - Don’t use this Company!

Update: No. The owner is lying! One call months later to ask me what the problem was. After I told them they said they would call me right back — they never did. They basically did not respond to any of my calls. I was stuck taking care of everything myself. It wasn’t an electrician that sited the errors but an inspector. I had to hire my own electrician to fix what they would not. Basically they didn’t know what they are doing during the install and following codes. They using Covid as an excuse. Buyer beware!< /Text>

Dave, our technician was very professional and informative. He was also able to fix the problem and the AC is back on!! We really appreciate the prompt and professional service.
Thanks guys - we will definitely use your company again.</Text>< user_id>

I have had over 10 visits from this company to fix the brand new heater and A/C unit they installed.

The owner is non responsive.  The people who Oversee issues have no authority to solve problems They are merely message takers.   It has been a year and the unit still does not work as it should.  No heat when it’s cold and no A/C when it’s hot.

I am now filing a complaint with the state license board to try to force them to fix the new unit they installed< /Text>

Do not use this company.  They are nice and come out for free, but then gave an estimate bid for $2000 to $6000 and didn't even get heat on for renters.  I suspected it was very bloated, so had a local company (Alpha) come out and he had it running in two hours, and then fixed the larger problem for a total of $585.  Make the extra call to someone else.</Text>

< Review>
“From the moment that I met with (Aaron W.), my encounter with SoCal Climate Control was really very professional. Every step in the process, from the initial discussion of purchase options, to the installation of the A/C unit itself, then the follow-up by the tech Angel and Angel Sr. They both were top notch. They were on time, very informative and really did unbelievable work! I met with several companies to give me a bid and SoCal was it! Best pricing by far! I would strongly recommend this local company for anyone looking for great products and an entire company who all are beyond helpful and incredibly awesome to work with!”.<//Review>

<Review>Tai, the lead tech, is  the best. He is knowledgeable, patient, responsible & reliable. He was part of the process from start to finish and not shy about getting his hands dirty. He does what it takes to make sure the client is satisfied. I had quite a few contractors come thru my home & some were cheaper but, there is something about his demeanor & presentation  skills that separated him from the rest. Cheaper isn’t always better. He and the company were great. Highly recommend them.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rating>4</rating><review>I would have given them 5 stars except they have a couple of things they don’t bother bring up. They also don’t follow up on requests.
1st they don’t mention that by law a building permit is required for work done over $500. It is also possible you could have an insurance issue if a permit is not pulled. Just be aware of any consequences of not getting one. They will handle this for you at an extra charge.
2nd the efficiency of the A/C unit was discussed but the efficiency of the heater was not. After the install a month ago, I found a need to climb in the attack to check their work and noticed that the sticker on the unit they installed is all the way at the bottom of the range. Maybe my fault for not asking but maybe something they should have brought up and gave me an option.
3rd two weeks (15 days) ago I reached out to the salesman to have one thing checked (had to climb in the attic myself to check work was done correctly, it was) and the other was the shield (steel) where the lines came out of the condenser was rubbing on the brass/copper lines. Eventually this could cause wear and a leak. I tweaked the shields so it no longer touches. POINT BEING NEVER HEARD A WORD FROM ANYONE. After reading other reviews it seems that after install service can be lacking. They did come right out to check a noise the day after install.
As for price and work. I’m not sure it was the best price; it was acceptable and I didn’t check around (back to permit being extra) so that’s on me.
The CREW WAS GREAT and did a good job.<//review>< userid>

<Review>Called and within a half hour someone was at my home. We needed to replace our whole system and they came on a Sunday and Labor Day in 120 degree weather and even found us a temporary room AC unit so we didn’t get dangerously hot with our 4 Dogs and 2 Cats. I can’t thank them enough and feel like these people helped us more than the job required and within a couple days we had a new AC, Blower, and Thermostat. Fernando and his guys were our heroes, no one else would come on a Holiday and crawled around in 120 degree attics for 3 days, I truly believe that.</Review>< Pics>

This company is absolutely amazing!! They are very professional and super prompt. They installed a new AC for us about a month ago. We recently noticed a small leak from the AC that went through our wall. I called them and they came out the next day and fixed it and set us up with a drywall company to fix the damage to our wall. That company was very professional as well. Even though we had that little hiccup of the leak, I would most definitely recommend them and use them again because of their prompt response as to resolve the issue. Thank you So Cal Climate Control.</text>

These guys are great! A little over a year ago I had an AC installed and a furnace replaced.  They did the job and actually exceeded my expectations because we all know that when you pay a lot of money for something there is always some "flux capacitor" that doesn't have the required 1.21 gigawatts.  I never had that issue with SoCal Climate Control.  They also check in from time to time, just to make sure everything is working and in tip top shape.</Review>

Aaron was the young man that came out to my home to give me a estimate and he explained all the details of the work and warranty of their products.  At this time I will not be able to have any work done a little out of the price range that i would like to spend.  If i decide in the near future I will definitely be giving SoCal a return call.< /text>

This is a great company that provides excellent services for AC and heating. I am grateful for Lance and Christ for making my home safe after noticing something that would be a health hazard. They immediately went over things and discussed it with me, so they can provide the proper AC/Heating unit. They did an awesome job installing the new ac unit and furnace. They did an awesome job installing new ducts. My family will be forever be grateful for Lance and Christ and SoCal climate control company for doing a great job because they went over and beyond to make my home feel good for the summer and winter. I thank you! And I thank you! May god bless you all for excellent service! I also want to thank Mike the owner as well!</Review>

Zero Stars Worst service. First time I had them come out they told me what needed to be fixed and gave me a quote.  It took a little over a week to fix but it eventually started working well at least for ONE DAY.  After one day it starts getting hot again.  I called back and had someone come back out they did and they found nothing wrong.  Decided just to deal with the heat then call back again.  Finally I called back again a few weeks later and asked for someone to come back out.  I received a call from a man one day before the appointment asking me what the problem was.  When I told him what it was doing he said maybe you should just get a new system.  I understand that might be what I need but that would have been great to know before I spent $700 a few weeks before.  I do not recommend this company unless you have money and time to waste.< /Text>

We didn’t purchase the system yet but plan to purchase in a couple of months.  The estimate was the best out of the other companies we’ve encountered & the customer service stellar. The men were attentive, polite, answered all questions & provided  literature, pictures , comparisons, choices   They also provided additional information about the HVAC system, went above & beyond to answer questions & check a couple of things that they weren’t even there to do. Very polite, kind, & genuine!< /Text>

The 2 gentlemen were professional, on time and very polite, maintaining social distancing and wearing their masks when necessary during the covd-19 virus period here in S. California. They worked steadily and checked with us as necessary. When they said it was time to try the A/C, we were impressed with the new  (replacement evaporate coil) improvement. It was very chilly fast. We were very satisfied. Thank you. We will recommend you to friends, also.<//Text>

SoCal Climate Control did an outstanding job installing our new 2.5 ton HVAC system. They removed and replaced our old shingled roof and put down new cool roof shingles. They showed up on time and performed the work requseted in a timely manner, completed the work when they said they would and we could not be happier with our new HVAC system. In addition we had them install a ducted exhaust for our new range hood. They replaced all our old HVAC ducting and installed new registers. We also had them install a new 200Amp service panel and 17 beautiful new solar panels which are now generating 6500 watts of power for our home. Mike and Bengi were great to work with, they answered all of our questions and addressed any and all concerns we had expressed. I would recommend SoCal Climate control to any one considering a new HVAC system, roofing and solar panel installation. SoCal Climate Control is a top notch, highly professional organization and we wouldn't think twice to use them again for any future project.</text>

Showed up in a timely manner. Kept in contact. Returned calls and texts. Explained the differences between the two different styles of a/c systems I was trying to git estimates on.
My issue was price. 1/3 more expensive then first estimate "which was also to expensive" and for identical system.  Looking for fair prices. I do know it's the wrong season to try purchasing< /Text>

On time with appointment, knowledgeable, upfront with costs and on-site quote.  Cost are probably comenserate with value of equipment and install expertise.

I would recommend getting a quote from them.</Review>

<text>Buyer beware of Socal Climate Control, I read the reviews and I thought this was a great company. However, my experience was very unpleasant. First, during the installation, one of their workers damaged my brick wall when they were bringing the air conditioning unit in my backyard.

When I confronted the worker about the damage, he lied and claimed he did not do it. When I called the company and spoke the the sales manager Mike Malloy, backed his employee and told me I was responsible for the damage.

To make matters worse, the heating unit that I purchased was junk and went from making whistling sound to not working within a week. Considering it was winter, my house was so cold it was unbearable for my small child to stay in the house until it was fixed. Upon informing the company, they put me on a two week wait list and stated that was the best they could do since they had many customers with similar issues. Their quick fix was to suggested I buy electric heaters until someone from the warranty department was available to fix it.

The moral to the story is you get what you pay for. I went with Socal Climate Control because they were cheaper. Some of the more expensive companies warned me to be aware of trying to saving a few bucks over quality of service. I guess they were right! So buyers please take heed to this review!<//text></record>

Very professional and efficient. My parents call me so desperate for someone to repair their air condition unit. Call So Cal Climate and send Ryan F. a very professional guy. It was an easy fix. My parents are so happy. Now they know who to call.<//review>

I called to schedule an appointment so a technician could provide me an estimate to clean my vents and furnace. The day of my appointment the technician called me ask me how many vents i have in my house and how old the furnace is and then proceeds to give me a quote without seeing the furance.  This was not the process that was explained to me  on the phone. The estimate was $1300. I dont know who or why they would try this in 2020.... very unprofessional i will not support this company.< /text>

Screwed us out of over $3000 of rebates.

Bought a heat pump system from them because heat pumps are eligible for two large rebates. They failed to claim one rebate, which can only be claimed by the contractor and not the homeowner, and they chose a specific model that is ineligible for the other rebate. We lost out on $3,250 of rebates because of them.</text>

I had multiple companies out to give estimates they were able to match my best offer and offer a better guarantee on the work done. They also were very quick, neat and professional when they installed the new unit.< /review>

Beginning with the estimate all the way through installation, the SoCal Climate Control teams were awesome.  They explained everything that a buyer should know about air conditioning/heating units and they did not oversell us on a larger unit (which is what I thought we needed) and suggested the right size for our square footage and home layout.  Landon provided all of the info and his team - Lance, Susie and Chris performed the install a few days later.  Removing the old units went smoothly and once the new units were in place and ready to go, Lance walked us through the initial runs of both units and what to expect for the first few minutes.  Aside from the excellent work putting in the a/c and heater units, they also did a great job cleaning up afterwards.

We received three estimates and are quite happy with SoCal Climate Control's price, quality of the product and the work performance of the people who work there.<//text>

Installers were very punctual, amicable and professional.  The two installers started the project immediately and their expertise was immediately apparent. They removed the old condenser and coil, installed the new units and when they completed the project the condition of the house ws as clean as it was before the project started. They adequately answered any technical question I asked , very professional.  Overall the best technicians I have ever had work on my property.
I am very satisfied!</Text>

<userid>102903297064522441925<//userid><text>Everyone I have dealt with from SoCal Climate Control has been great.  The person who scheduled our appointment worked with me to set up a time that was convenient and the technician provided a quote and also did the work I needed right then.  The house we just bought needed the heating unit serviced and the old thermostat replaced.  He fixed our heater and installed a new thermostat that I bought.  Unfortunately, the one I bought didn't work with our old heating unit.  He told me what models would work and I ran to the Home Depot right near by and bought another one while he waited.  He installed it and now we have a warm house before the Thanksgiving holiday.  Happy ending and a reasonable price.< /text>< rate>

Well,  after 2 visits,  I hate to say it but the new condensation reservoir failed and over flowed from the attic and all over my kitchen floor and in one large cabinet. What a mess. You asked.
I’m not happy with the way I was scheduled to resolve the problem. Having had the service call twice and paid my bill promptly, I feel I should have been put at the front of the line and had this taken care immediately. I’m waiting 4 days for a service man.
I think that the part was replaced in good faith..... I think that the part is defective  but what do I know. You asked and I hope I can get this fixed soon. It gets hot.< /text>

Everyone was super, kind, safe, and clean - tarps on the floor. We appreciate the respect of staying away from us and allowing us all to avoid close contact during this crazy pandemic. I was really nervous about them coming, but 15 min into them being here, I was calm.
I also want to recommend the air scrubber. I have allergies to cats and have three cats. Okay, no judgement- we develop worse allergies as we age and we adopted my mother’s cat after she died. Anyway, the air scrubber has taken away all my issues- as well as having no dust if you can believe it!! And I forgot to tell you they gave us a one room AC unit to borrow until they could make it here - saving us from 90° weather! Great company. Second time I have used them!<//Review>

I made appointment the same day and was waiting in 3 hours window and nobody showed up
Explanation was the technician was late with last client so he couldn’t come . They rescheduled  me to 2 days after first appointment in the morning 8-10.am . So he finally arrives at 10 am. He didn’t even try to check anything he just asked why ac is not working and how old is unit. I have been at this place for 3 years but wasn’t sure how old ac unit is . So he just assumed it was too old sto work on it and said we can’t do anything about it . He did not even try to open  to check it out .they wasted my time twice. Very unprofessional.

Ps
I am reading other reviews and noticed how owner replies only to positive ones. It showes you how “professional” they are. I wish I did more research before I contact them

Edited on 11/4

Answer to their reply

if you read my review you will notice that I already said that you never checked how old the unit was . My ac got fixed now with other company and they said my unit is only 9 years old .

< Review>
My experience with this company was excellent!
After having received an estimate some months before, which I found to be beyond my budget, I was notified of an ongoing sale. Very efficient merchandising and consideration of the needs of a potential clent.

Once the arrangements were completed, Mike (sales manager) and his staff went out of their way to accommodate me and the unique needs of the installation. The technicians who accomplished it were very knowledgeable and  creative regarding the placement of vents, return and ducts and the completed project was very much to my satisfaction.

I will most certainly consult SoCal climate Control when and the time comes  to upgrade the system to include air conditioning.</Review>

I highly recommend this company.  Their technician came out to perform a free diagnostic service on my heating unit and during that time found the problem immediately that two other technicians from other companies didn't find because they were interested in up-selling their company's services and products and they charged for their service.  After the SoCal Climate Control technician found the problem which was a bad mother board, he showed me how he found it and what the error codes meant on the schematic.  He asked me if I wanted to go ahead and have him order the part and he could pick it up and install it the next morning.  I'm not suggesting this would happen for everyone but it did happen in two days for me.  The prices were competitive and he completed the job the next day on time and within budget. Before leaving he checked that all the components were working and that the whole system was working.  He was very knowledgeable and worked very fast as he knew what he was doing.  He showed me every step in the diagnosis and part replacement process.  I will certainly use this company again for all my HVAC needs.   Thanks SoCal Climate Control for sending out such an experienced technician..he did a great job.</Text>

<Review>Did a good job installing my dual sided wall heater. Neat and kept things clean. Managed to do the job quickly without any problems.  Perhaps the only negative is that they said they would call 15 minutes before arriving and they just showed up.  We were not home and had to rush home.</Review>< response>

I would recommend SoCal Climate Control to anyone looking to replace their heating/cooling system.  They offered quality equipment and made an excellent installation.  Their personnel were professional, responsive and followed through on their work.  Finally, the price was very fair.  Solid performance all around.</text>

Had an appointment for them to come 3-5pm and they never showed.
Called them to confirm and they said they would have to look into it and never came out or called back.
Good thing for me though as the bad reviews said they purposely break machines and forge documents.
Luckily my machine works and only wanted to get a tune up.
I will pay my money to another company who is honest.</Text>

<text>I don’t know about all reviews that people post online.  Real??? My AC was installed last week by SOCAl. Two technicians spent a lot of time reading a manual, after 7hrs, they still couldn’t figure it out. So another company “Air Pro heating” showed up with extra 3technicians , couldn’t finish the job that was told, left 8pm.

This is mini splitAC, it should be a simple installation. Don’t tell me extra cost when they couldn’t do the job properly. It shouldn’t be.

The problem is they said yes to everything in first place, then at the time of install, can’t do this and that.Technical difficulties- yes there are some and I agree.

I called AC maker to check the installation problem, why water was dripping and lines were sticking out. They said probably...installer was not properly trained or not much experience of the particular item. I called SOCALagain.

I read so many good reviews about customer
service, but how about work??</text>< user>

Awesome experience with this company. Charles S. ,the field supervisor at So cal climate control, walked us thru every step in this process. We had been without air conditioning for several years and after Charles ' professional site survey he suggested that if I bundled the much needed new hvac system with  a solar system I could practically get it free after rebates and tax incentives. He introduced me to Leo at Diamond solar and  I am now sitting in my air conditioned home with no electric bill. I would highly recommend charles at so cal if you have any questions about heating and air.< /review>

I gave SoCal Climate Control a 5 star rating because they were the best out there. After my regular, very honest AC guy retired I’ve been had by unethical snobs who will not survive Karma!
I really like Ryan Foley. I got to know a thing or two about AC/ heating. His diagnosis was right on. Their prices were fair and I sensed that they were honest.
What I didn’t like. If I wasn’t alert, the workers were confused and brought only one furnace and one coil unit when we paid for two. That got taken care of, but made the job longer.
We got a decent AC condenser, but the side was a bit dinged up. I like new stuff clean and pristine.
The guys left without installing the thermostat. One of the guys was supposed to bring a frame that would not show the unpainted areas from removing the old thermostat. He didn’t. So I was told that somebody would come back the next day to install. They never brought the frame and now we have to deal with trying to match the paint.
I withheld $1500 from the final payment because the thermostat was not installed when it should have. I did not appreciate, Mike, one of the owners leaving me a sarcastic message about withholding the money. I had every right to do so. They got their full payment. So that message was unnecessary.
They still got 5 stars because no one else out there deserves it. When it was all said and done, we got a good deal and they are honest.
More to review as I deal with them in the future.</Text>

Mr Molloy and his team were very professional during this process of furnace and AC replacement. They gave me a good price for the installation and even improved the air flow in my home  which was problematic and not set up properly. They were responsive, respectful and answered all my questions. I received great customer service which I appreciate very much!<//Review>

<Text>I had a great experience with SoCal Climate Control. They were able to quickly dispatch someone to me. Our tech, Tai, was absolutely great! He explained everything thoroughly and was communicative about scheduling. We ended up needing a new motor, which was his initial diagnosis, but when he came back to do the repair, he also brought multiple other parts to troubleshoot other possible fixes. I SO appreciated the diligence of bringing everything to make sure the unit was up and running when he left. I would absolutely hire this company again.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Came out during the hottest week of the year for an inspection and quoted us the cheapest fix first. When that didn't work we weren't charged. It ended up being the blower motor which he told us it could be. The part wasn't on hand so he ordered it and set a time to come back. When that day came we received a call letting us know they had a cancellation and could come sooner. After he fixed the motor he stayed around making sure everything was working properly.  Made sure the house was cool before he left. They are very prompt, honest, and affordable. We'll be going through them for yearly maintenance, no doubt!!!<//review>< Pics>

SoCal Climate Control is an excellent company.  I refer my friends to this company.  They are extremely professional, took the time to listen to our needs, and gave me options to consider.  My old HVAC system was over 30 years old.  We have 4 1400 sq ft apartment units.  Reliability and longevity were major considerations.  SoCal was able to install 4 2 ton Trane ACs at a very reasonable cost.  Well within the quotes I received for units of lesser quality and shorter warranties.  Their customer service is excellent.

However, what I appreciate the most (and my Engineering friend too) is how their technicians explain everything to you.  You are able to make better decisions about your HVAC system because you have a clearer understanding of what’s actually happening in the system.  Perhaps a proactive maintenance or replacement of particular part can avert a potential problem, or extend the life of your system.  They prefer to fix problems for a long term solution.  If you want a short term Mickey Mouse fix Don’t use them.  SoCal doesn’t work that way.  They are reasonable, but not bargain basement.  But, if you want quality HVAC install, or repair at a fair price, I highly recommend SoCal.<//text>

<date>1596591853132</date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Not sure what just happened but maybe I caught someone who woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I was connected to them via home advisor and spoke initially with Don. I explained that I am a real estate agent calling on behalf of a client who needs an evaluation of the HVAC system in a home he is purchasing in Los Angeles. He immediately adopted a confrontational attitude with me, telling me that real estate agents are a "red flag" for him. because we never want to pay for anything. Odd since my client was ready to whip out his credit card for anyone who did the evaluation. Why would we expect anything else if someone does work? He kept telling me it would be $250 for what he called a "real estate inspection" but later said it would be a free evaluation. It was very confusing and when I tried to get clarification, he asked me. "Do you even know what a real estate inspection is?" We soon concluded our call. Don was arrogant and condescending.  Another man called back about ten minutes later, asking if everything was worked out, so he obviously was aware of the first call. I explained that my client was looking to hire someone for an hvac evaluation. It was more of the same runaround nonsense, with him even telling me that they would do it "when there's an owner." Did he think any of this would not be done in conjunction with the current owner? It was the craziest and most frustrating experience I've had with an HVAC company in 16 years. Maybe it's a Los Angeles thing but we were just looking to give someone money for their work, plain and simple. I see the reviews are good so I'll just take a deep breath and remember that none of us know what's going on someone else's life at any given moment. I'll leave it at that.< /review>< pics>

<Review>David Park installed two new ducts to replace torn ducts leading out of our A/C unit. He did a great job. He is very professional and engaging. He was careful to explain everything he was going to do, and why he was doing it. Afterwards, he thoroughly cleaned up after himself. I recommend him highly.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Workers were very respectful and they clean up after themselves. The job was done in half of the estimated time. Aaron came out, to check the job, after all work was completed. The whole HVAC system was replaced and it works perfectly.<//Review>

Amazing service from SoCal Climate Control! They figured out what SoCal Gas couldn't (took SoCal Gas a week to arrive) and got our heater up an running very quickly! Thanks to Danny the technician and Susie on the phone!

There won't be any other company I call again for my heating needs (don't have air conditioning here at the beach).

5 star plus service - highly recommended!!!</text>

I had to replace two air conditioning units for a commercial building. Being in Arizona, David, mike and everyone involved made it easy for me to rely On.  I drove to meet David, to discuss the details, but after that So Cal took over, they even worked closely, and communicated with the roofing company, so they can all work simultaneously, and complete this project. Thank you So Cal, great job!!!!<//Review>

Very professional and courteous technician (Ti) and he did a thorough  inspection of the old unit. Quoted 2 different brands and the price was reasonable. However, I have decided to go with a local company who has offered a better quality unit (Rheem) at a lower cost. (Company owner is a family friend).  I would certainly recommend SoCal to others simply because of their prices and professional manner.<//Review>

I am extremely dissatisfied with the service. They botched the installation of the AC mini split until; using 120 volt wiring instead of the 240 volt wiring required. I asked them to repair this two weeks ago and I am still waiting for it to be fixed.
If the wiring is not repaired immediately I will file a complaint with the State Contractor's License Board. I will demand that their bond be used to repair their botched job.< /review>

I just had my central air serviced by Danny and I'm so glad I did. He was so friendly and so honest about what I needed. He also advised me what I didn't need, which is where I knew I can trust him completely. He didn't waste any time getting things done. He was able to do all the diagnostics, and recommended repairs quickly so I can get on with my work day. He had all the parts he needed in his vehicle so I didn't have to worry about ordering a specialized part. I really wish I had found this company a decade ago because they would have saved me so much money and heartache. My AC unit is blowing ice cold air now, which my wife and I love. I have supreme confidence that it will work perfectly on those week long heat waves in the San Gabriel Valley. I'm sure all their technicians are great, but if you have a chance to request Danny you definitely should. It's so difficult to find a highly skilled HVAC technician that's also friendly and trustworthy. Danny is all three.<//Text>

<Review>Honesty and integrity are two  characteristics every business should have, and this company does possess both.  They worked on my HVAC and stood behind the work until I was happy.  I found their entire staff to be professional and extremely conscientious, and their guys really know their stuff.  I shopped around before hiring this company, and found their prices were very fair.

When you don't know a lot about services, it is important to find a company who will be honest and not try to rip you off.  I feel very confident in recommending this company as one with a high level of integrity.< /Review>< Pictures>

Robert intentionally slowed everything down. Service times were scheduled by SoCal Climate Control but could not be met.
It took four (HOT) weeks in April and May to do a service call, that was eventually done in under two hours. Call backs rarely happens when promised.</Text>

I called to schedule an estimate for work done. They had an opening from 3-5pm the very next day! So I waited around for the phone call saying they were on their way. I had somewhere to be so I left at 5. No phone call from SoCal Climate Control. I got a call at 5:10 with a voicemail that said their tech’s morning job went long and we’d have to reschedule for some other time. (Didn’t they know much earlier in the day he wouldn’t be arriving?!?) Then I got a text 5 minutes later asking how my appointment went! I replied with these same details above with no response from them, nor an apology. Just now I got a link to provide feedback. Ha! I definitely won’t be using a company that clearly has communication problems. You’ve been warned.< /Text>

I am so frustrated. Had a brand new air conditioner put in Dec. 14. Turned it on April 24th and the condenser is not cooling the air. Called every day for 4 days and finally got a appointment May 6th. The problem being I am told is because it is under warranty. The tech came  put more coolant in. Worked great on the 6th but the next day same thing. Called again on May 8 and I am again still waiting for a appointment time. Am I going to have to wait another 12 days? And will it get fixed?</Review>

<review>The installation was  completed in one day according to schedule. The technicians were  proficient and very professional. We had a post installation review and testing.  The system was tested in a various locations in the house to ensure that   it cooled the entire house. The cooling effect was  very good, The head technician  gave me his business card and said that i should contact him  if there are any problems.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

They send Ryan who says he's an engineer, but is only their salesperson & technician, he says u can call him anytime (not true). Tayler in the office takes ur calls & answer all questions up until you sign agreement and take ur money, thereafter you are SOL. The frustration sets if and when ur having trouble turning on your new heater or want to ask when they are returning to complete the work, and all of a sudden they are "not available, on the phone, not in, etc.etc."  No one returns your calls until u threaten to stop pay ur check. For this lack of professionalism, I would not recommend them.</text>

Doug Showed up on time, he got the job done, and was very respectful.Doug  was very professional, found the problem right away, and went above and beyond our expectations. This company has an outstanding employee named Doug. The company gave us a quick response to all of our questions and called us back once they received the information on our AC part. I highly recommend this company to everyone. Thank you, SoCal you did an excellent job.< /Text>

Terrible customer service!  I have called three times so far and can't seem to get anyone to return my telephone call to setup a service appointment for the mini-split system this company installed.  The company installed the system in two parts because I was in the middle of a major renovation.  During the first phase, I asked the company to install the air handlers while the walls were open.  They did so.  In the second phase, I asked them to come back and energize the units.  They did this also.  However, I never ran the system after they left until last week when temperatures reached the mid-90s.  I have called three times and I get a different story each time I call.  I was told they were trying to figure out whether it is a "warranty issue" or an "installation issue" and someone would call me back.  All the while they try to figure things out, I AM HOT!!!  Frustrating.  I spent thousands for this company to do this install.  I wish I had gone with another company.< /text>

<review>From the 1st phone call with Bill (answering the phone) to Benji coming to my house for my estimate, ending with Joey & Patrick (with smiles) installing all brand new equipment, what a pleasure to deal with Everyone!!  I have been doing a lot of remodeling and have been dealing with lots of people, SoCal Climate Control was perfect in every way, I have nothing bad to say, all great!  Everyone was so positive and my house is so cold! I will recommend you guys to anyone looking for help with their air conditioning.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1567194446585, 'text': 'Thank you, Dawn!'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80c29d23ca6d56c1:0x2b3dcf7916794cc3</Gmap_id></record>

<review>I had an overall pleasant experience with SoCal Climate Control. I have to give a big shout out to Tyler, we talked over 10 times throughout the process of my full HVAC and ductwork replacement and he helped me out all along the way happily, with great customer service. There was a couple hiccups in the process but it was all resolved and attended to in a timely manner! Doug came out to do my estimate and pre fab appointment and was informative and helpful. The technicians that were on my project worked hard and did a good job, they communicated and cleaned up at the end of both days. They were competitive in pricing and worked with me on my overall job. Thank you Mike/Tyler/Doug and the rest of the  SoCal Climate team!<//review>< gmap_id>

<Review>I found SoCal Climate on Thumbtack. My husband and I have dealt with two other companies who were not professional at all. They wouldn't return our calls or would show up several hours after the window quoted. First off, SoCal responded within minutes to my inquiry. They arrived within the window given. Even called before arriving . Tai was kind, professional, and even found the problem withing minutes. The experience was such a relief and a breath of fresh air. We will be using them again when it's time to reply our AC unit .</Review><user_name>Alma De</user_name><gmap_id>0x80c29d23ca6d56c1:0x2b3dcf7916794cc3< /gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1567298758776, 'text': 'Thank you, Alma!'}</Response>< user>

<Text>Doug Showed up on time, he got the job done, and was very respectful.Doug  was very professional, found the problem right away, and went above and beyond our expectations. This company has an outstanding employee named Doug. The company gave us a quick response to all of our questions and called us back once they received the information on our AC part. I highly recommend this company to everyone. Thank you, SoCal you did an excellent job.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Excellent service regarding a few months without a filter for my furnace. The technician has checked everything and he charged me only for the estimate, a very reasonable fee. I highly recommend SoCal

<Text>We engaged SoCal Climate to replace aging ductwork in our condo. We also invited quotes from 2 other contractors both of whom failed to notify us about asbestos remnants that needed abatement. SoCal technicians discovered the issue prior to offering a quote and bundled abatement services with a 3rd-party provider. The SoCal technician took an engineering approach to the problem - measuring the cfms from the returns vs. HVAC capacity and recommended an additional intake to improve the air flow. The firm offered a very competitive quote and the installers who put the new duct work did a great job removing the old duct pipes and insulation and making a clean intake cutout. Everything was timely and good clean up afterwards. Would strongly recommend SoCal for major HVAC projects. A noticeable improvement in HVAC performance within an hour of system commission.< /Text>< Pics>

Unfortunately we got off to a bad start and it took some time getting it right but in the end SoCal Climate Control came through and did an excellent job installing a Daikin Multi-Split System with 4 air handlers in my house in Eagle Rock.  It's very quiet and seems to work great !   Dave Z.</text>

Super friendly, and definitely didn’t come to give me an estimate to make a quick buck. Ryan was super professional and informational. They are definitely for the people and not their own pockets. Recommend them a hundred times over!</Text>

<Date>1565240033301<//Date><rate>1< /rate><review>This has been a bit of a harrowing experience. The people there are very nice. They are always friendly and they seem knowledgeable. However, the negatives greatly outweigh the positives. I communicate with them regularly about problems with the system, but their communications with me lack. When late, they don’t contact me about being late or needing to reschedule. I should not have to call them to tell them that they missed their appointment. I have also lost all trust in any of their workers or those they subcontract with. My system was installed over a month ago and it has not worked as it’s supposed to for longer than about a week. They have come out several times to “fix” the problem, but new problems always arise or the same problem keeps happening. I understand that each house has its own intricacies and issues, but the lack of communication and the feeling that they don’t really care about their work and, therefore, their customers overshadows their positive demeanor. The contractor looking at my house for updates even said that their work was shoddy at best. I try to look on the bright side of life and give people the benefit of the doubt, but my patience is quickly waning and I don’t know how much more I have to give.< /review>< Pics>

I got 2 swift phone calls after my inquiry. Gave  details about the project; I needed to obtain an HVAC proposal for a new construction home of about 2450 sq feet, one story, to include one mini split for one bedroom of about 380 sq ft and conventional HVAC for the rest of the house. The proposal had to be based on approved plans by the city. No one seems to be listening but insisted that according to policy they had to visit the house knowing full well that the existing  small house will be demolished in few weeks.

I told the caller who made the appointment that I will have the house open to go see it but I was not going to be there.
The appointment was to be between 8-10 am the next morning but a couple arrived at 12 noon with a ladder. The person called me from the house telling me that there was not enough space in the attic to put docks...Purposefully, I had left the plans there and guide him through the them to see the new construction, new roof, plenty space for docks, the room for the mini split and I offered to send him the plans in PDF file if could send me an email address. He said he will talk to his engineer and get back to me. That is the last I heard from him and from this company.
The calls were from 818 and 949 area codes and neither one was willing to listen and understand the nature of the project. SO CAL climate control is not capable of doing such project and you never send an employee in a house without the owner or a responsible person being there (liability).
This is how stupid this company is.
I do not know how any one would hire this company.</text>

I have been extremely please with my experience with So Cal. Ryan gave me three estimates which others were  unwilling to do. The young men that did the install was very professional and pleasant. There was a problem with a piece of the equipment that was not working. Concerning this  I  immediately received a call from the owner of the company assuring me that it would be corrected. Have you ever made a purchase and immediately had buyers regret , I can tell you that this is not the case with this company. Very professional.< /Text>

It was late on a Friday on Labor Day weekend and the AC went out.  It was going to be 100 degrees in the Valley that weekend so I was panicked.  I was able to reach Mike at SoCal Climate and he arranged to have someone out the next day.  It turned out I need a new breaker box because the old one literally blew up and caught fire. The technician was able to swap it out within 2 hours and we were back in business enjoying the rest of the weekend!! Thank you SoCal Climate!</review>

Representative showed up on time. He was polite. He took a quick tour of my home and pretended to look at stuff, using only his i phone as light when he popped his head into the attic. Our system is two years old but evidently that was enough for him to quote me $2600 to clean ducts. That was the highest quote from three company's estimates by 150%. When I pointed it out, I was suddenly eligible for a discounted rate. And out the door he went.<//text>

A professional team. They came and checked my AC and did not find any issues. They did not try to sell something that I did not need. And their visits are free. They don’t charge to come and estimate the work. Will use their services from now on.< /review>

Air intake box below my AC had very old and dirty insulation. SoCal Climate Control was able to send a technician the next day and  the old insulation was replaced quickly and cleanly. Job well done!< /review>

It was late on a Friday on Labor Day weekend and the AC went out.  It was going to be 100 degrees in the Valley that weekend so I was panicked.  I was able to reach Mike at SoCal Climate and he arranged to have someone out the next day.  It turned out I need a new breaker box because the old one literally blew up and caught fire. The technician was able to swap it out within 2 hours and we were back in business enjoying the rest of the weekend!! Thank you SoCal Climate!</Text>

<date>1571228814761</date><Rate>5</Rate><text>SoCal Climate Control was great from start to finish. Contacted them via Yelp and they got back to me within an hour (high marks for that alone imo). David was pleasant & professional on the phone and set our appointment quickly and efficiently. Benji, the technician scheduled to come out and examine the system, called as promised before the appointment, and arrived exactly when he said he would. Benji is great. They probably can't let you pick which tech is coming out, but if you hear it is Benji you'll be fine. He is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything thoroughly. Fingers crossed no issues any time soon with our HVAC - but SoCal Climate Control will be on our speed dial from now on just in case.<//text>< pictures>

I had my AC down twice and they were very professional by sending someone after hours inspite of the technician being on leave. The guys who came in to service was very thorough with his explanation and the service he provided. They have a great team who is always CO-ordination with each other to help their customers.</review>

This is the second HVAC that SoCal Climate has installed for me.  First they went out of their way to get my rental house quickly installed during a heat wave 2 years ago and I have had no problems since.  So, when I needed a new system at my home, they were the only company I called.  Their installation was flawless and I am so thankful  to Jet for her kind and helpful service.< /Text>

<Review>Doug was very professional & patiently explained what he was doing during the furnace safety inspection.  I would like to sign up for the the ongoing health check for the A/C unit.  When the inspection is performed on the A/C function, does the technician hose off the evaporator coils?

11/08/19

Still waiting for invoice for service performed by Doug for furnace health check.  AHS  demands proof of this in case a problem occurs for them to provide service.  Please advise.

05/10/20

Francisco was very precise & performed an in depth inspection.  He provided his business card & encouraged us to call him if we encounter any A/C problems since he lives in Quartz Hill which makes him a local contact.  Very nice to know.  Please provide invoice for service performed since AHS wants proof in case a problem occurs.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Especially in today's tight market for satisfying service, it was a breath of fresh air to hire SoCal Climate Control to do our HVAC! Their sales rep was respectful and conscientious, their management was concerned and happy to help, and their crew was creative and CLEAN! After every day they worked, their workspaces in my house were left orderly and tidy which is especially important because we have young children and pets.

I am happy to give my recommendation to SoCal Climate Control without reservation!< /Review>< Rating>

I would like to sign up for the the ongoing health check for the A/C unit.  When the inspection is performed on the A/C function, does the technician hose off the evaporator coils?

11/08/19

Still waiting for invoice for service performed by Doug for furnace health check.  AHS  demands proof of this in case a problem occurs for them to provide service.  Please advise.

05/10/20

Francisco was very precise & performed an in depth inspection.  He provided his business card & encouraged us to call him if we encounter any A/C problems since he lives in Quartz Hill which makes him a local contact.  Very nice to know.  Please provide invoice for service performed since AHS wants proof in case a problem occurs.</Review><response>{'time': 1572832523014, 'text': 'James, thank you for the kind review!'}</response>< rating>

<Text>Hired them to move AC condenser from rooftop where previous home owners contractors had done a horrible job installing in many ways. SoCal worked very fast moving and reinstalling the condenser and also brought a few other AC items up to code than my home inspector had pointed out when I purchased the home last summer.   No complaints from tenants during the install. They did not try to upsell me by using scare tactics like other companies that provided estimates.  I would definitely hire them again...but hope I don't have to.  :-)</Text>< rating>

Outstanding service. Doug actually fixed my outside compressor, instead of testing it for two minutes and telling me I need a new one like the other two companies I called out did. Will use them again for all my heating and ac needs.</review>

The weather has been in the 40's at night lately and no one wants to come in to a business that is as cold inside as it is outside. We tried two companies that both tried to up sell us a new heating and air conditioning company. They were both priced quite high. SoCal Climate Control not only rebuilt our system at a great price, but did it the same day. Mike was the manager at SoCal and he made me feel like I was more than just another job on their work day. Excellent customer service at a great price. We need more service businesses in Southern California like SoCal Climate Control.</Review>< Time>

Charles from SoCal Climate control was very informative during our free estimate to replace an old AC unit. Listened to our comments and gave a fair estimate for a unit that would meet our needs.  Ended up choosing SoCal climate control as our HVAC contractor.</review>

I needed two air conditioner heater units repaired on a commercial building with tenants. So Cal Climate Control gave an estimate to repair three blower capacitors for $1060. Being in a hurry I went ahead with the repairs.
When my grown son heard the price he was very upset. This type of capacitor costs about $25 each whereas I was charged $300 each.< /Review>

I will never use any other company, they were experienced, knowlegeable, efficient, in and out in one afternoon, and their pricing was very competitive.
They even beat all the other estimates I had gotten. I was able to make a deal with them at around 5:00 in the afternoon, and was enjoying the cool air the next day. I recommend them to anybody!

<Review>Our A/C system needed to be replaced and, out of the four contractors that came out to our house, SoCal Climate Control showed a distinct approach right off the bat.

Tai made a really good first impression: he was very thorough in his inspection and assessment and he took the time to explain his findings and answer all related questions. The estimates that were provided were clear and at down-to-earth prices. SoCal Climate Control customer service representatives [I interacted with Nolen, Tyler and Chris] were very courteous and professional.

The installation team they sent did a good job; however, they left a gap [around where the new plenum box was installed] in my garage ceiling. I communicated that to Tai and, the next business day, Chris called to schedule their patch-and-paint person’s visit, a very courteous gentleman who did a good job.

I highly recommend SoCal Climate Control given their professionalism and quality service.

Sincerely.

<Review>I just wanted to thank Tai, Mike, and the team at SoCal Climate Control. They changed out all our HVAC air ducts (asbestos wrapped from 1977), brought our gas supply and venting up to code, and added another duct with return grill. They also added a furnace intake opening/grill. They were the first quote out of four, and the difference ended up being night and day. They honestly told us what we needed, with Tai using industry technical standards to calculate the particulars (the other three contractors either didn't know how or weren't interested in calculating to find out exactly what we needed. They DID make sure to tell us that we were about to be killed by the asbestos (not true - it was intact and undisturbed) and if we didn't let them abate it the next day (for almost twice the cost that SoCal Climate Control quoted) we were insane! Needless to say, we went with SoCal and are thankful we did. The team they sent did great work and I'm convinced the price was very honest, and our particular job had some challenges that the Company went above and beyond to solve for us. I highly recommend Socal Climate Control to anyone who is considering or needing any HVAC related work to be done.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
My grandparent’s AC went out during this past hot summer and couldn’t find a trustworthy company that didn’t try to up sell us on unnecessary things. So I did some research and came across this company. Carey and Jimmy showed up on time and they were very nice and professional. They were honest and showed us exactly what the problem was. It was only a $350 repair and these other companies tried to convince my grandparents they needed a whole new unit!! Trust me when I say call these guys for all your hvac needs!! Thank you SoCal Climate!!< /Review>

When it rains it pours. Sunday morning we open our restaurant for breakfast, only to find two of our HVAC roof top units are down again. This has been a ongoing thing for 6 months. Almost every month we have a trusted national brand company called Carrier Air Conditioning back to repair one or both of our HVAC problems. Today's a different day. They could not come so I called another company. SoCal Climate Control. They sent a service man out right away. The roof top units that Carrier was servicing were Mickey and Minnie Mouse patched together. After the service man inspected the units he came down to see me. He said, " Sir you need to come to the roof and see what I found. O.M.G, what a mess. He brought the first unit up in less than a hour and rewired the mess that Carrier made. With in a half hour the second unit was going strong. It looked like none of our filters had been changed on 6 different HVAC roof top units. I paid Carrier every 6 months to change them. Needless to say, they have not ran this good for year's. No one will ever touch my units again but SoCal Climate Control. Thanks guys for saving a Golden Corral Buffet & Grill.<//Text>

The Ac repairman that was sent to my house quoted me on the wrong thing that needed to be fixed on both of my Air Conditioners. Over $1100 he told me. I bought a Home Warranty and paid a $75 detectable my Ac’s work now So Cal Climate guy said it was my Mother board and Transformers but it was just a fuse smh! I will never deal with this place again!</Text>

Till date I have not found a truthful HVAC Company.  This company gets two stars because they are one star better than the worst conman I had dealt with before this when the capacitor had failed.

Their technician showed up promptly with mask and booties.  Did some fake tricks, appeared scared and genuinely concerned.  Thanks to Hollywood, I know some acting too and can read body language, but this guy was good, he looked me in the eye while lying, but something else gave it away! (Spoiler alert - not good acting)

He showed me a couple of photos of rust in the drain pan, two sheet metal screws that had distorted the holes (either by him or someone from his company who had come a few months ago, pre-covid), some removed bolts on the attic floor.  Hmm he spent an hour in the attic, the bolts must have just fallen off with his stare.  These were some insignificant metal sheets he was pointing to with distorted holes.  He then said the whole equipment has to be replaced as everything is rusted and the gas furnace is spilling gas into the attic space.  This conman quoted me $6000+ for a new furnace, another $8000 for compressor system that will work in conjunction with the rated BTU.  While the previous company who had not even looked at the furnace had said $18000+ for compressor system and $30000 for brand new everything.

All that because some $30 worth of 1/4" rubber hoses and condensation pipes has to be replaced and he is neither skilled nor qualified to do that.  From what I noticed, he had disabled all the safety switches, tampered with kill switch in the furnace panel door, dismantled the gas cutoff switch and let it dangle close the the burner (showed a pic and said someone had done it on purpose), turned off gas and power supply lines, disconnected the electrical wires.  He said he did all that 'to prevent my house from catching fire and saved our family from a catastrophe.'

Boy! I was scared to see the rust and the furnace burner firing up from his video.< /Text>
