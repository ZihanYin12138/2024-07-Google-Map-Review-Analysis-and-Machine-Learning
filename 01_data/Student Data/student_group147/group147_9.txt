Not as great as I remembered.... Lots of 2nd hand clothing and everyone selling Covid masks!
Not as diversified selection and many vendors not selling here !  I only spent a few dollars on honey for my allergies... And left empty handed!</review>

Found what I needed within ten minutes!

Side note: dogs are not allowed, website does not mention.
Please list on the website that you do not allow dogs because I brought mine with me and found out at the entrance she was not allowed.<//Text>

<Review>There just isn't much there and everyone is spread out all over the property instead of grouping them closer to make it easier for people who are "shopping". (Dont know if this is usual for winter? )
I remember there used to be so much more variety.   Now most of it is more like open air clothing, hats, phone accessory booths.  Several booths selling tools, but those we talked to were asking too much (one tool was priced higher than we could buy brand new elsewhere!)< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I used to come here as a kid, and I have fond memories of all the cool treasures of the marketplace. It shifted from a true flea market where people sell their home items, to a primarily Hispanic store where reoccurring vendors sell the same junk every week. There is nothing wrong with that if you are looking for good fruit, candy, veggies and some clothing. If you are looking for those hidden gems of another mans junk being your treasure, you would have better luck trying the Santa Rosa flea market near the fairgrounds.</review>< pictures>

The vendors that do this every weekend and sell new stuff are too expensive., the wares tend to be cheaply made. The mariachi band was annoying. It doesn't have the depth of the other main flea in Sonoma County, but it's friendlier, the management doesn't gouge you like Vets does...</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>3</Rating>< gmapID>

We got there at noon so it might have been Fuller but there wasn't too much to look at. Normal flea market fare but not too crowded either which is a plus in my book. Some vendors charge more some less but there is always a couple stalls selling something I want so all in all it was something to do on a weekend. I recommend going earlier to get the best stuff.</text>

Sundays are very busy (depending on weather of course) and full of different treasures. Lovely family owned establishment.

If your looking for fruits and vegetables this is the place to be. It was fun to walk through but like a big yard sale.</review>

<Time>1516212479133< /Time><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>3</Rating><Review>Ive been going here all of my life. They sell many different things here but sometimes i feel like if its not worth it. The things that are bought here are cheap and not durable. That is becuase people that have things that they dont need or want only sell it here for a cheap price to get rid of it. Other people sell good things that are some-what valuable. They also sell ice cream here. I highyl recommend it. The drinks are amazing as well as the food. The food in where they sell mexican food is called "loncheras" there is only 1 placed all the way in the back. At the front you can grab corn on the cob. I highly recomment it as well as the fruit that they sell. Food and drinks are amazing<//Review><UserId.>115223971911402370316</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Does a pretty good job - easy to get in and out quickly. Doesn't clean up the back as well as the front of the car and when I first started coming here it did not leave water spots and seems to do so now.< /review>

I am not terribly impressed by the wash that the automated system does, but I do like the fact that it is reasonably priced and they have free vacuums and air nozzles if you want to get a more detailed clean.<//Review>

<Review>Brand new car wash. This is an Express car wash. You stay in the car while it travels through the tunnel. Then you self vacuum and detail. The car wash does a good job washing your car. Just keep in mind your car has to be well cared for to begin with. Don't expect miracles if it is filthy dirty. Very clean and efficient facilities. The staff is very friendly and helpful.</Review>< pictures>

Car came out clean and dry. They have a giant finishing area. Vacuums are extremely  powerful to reach all the dirt. Also in vacuum area they offer compressed air to get small cracks and crevices that the vacuum won't get. Never seen this available before. I even got a free mask with my wash. I hear they are opening one in Lake Elsinore on Hwy 74. Can't wait.</review>< user_name>

<text>I have been looking forward to this car wash opening for some time. I went for the first time today and it didn't disappoint. The staff was friendly, the wash quality was very high, and the vacuums were very powerful. I purchased "The Best" wash - it came with a single use glass wipe, dash wipe, small wiping rag that I used to dry my wheels, and a face mask. I don't know if those items are always included, but it was a nice touch. Considering a monthly pass because I love having a very clean car.< /text>< gmapID>

Eco Express Car Wash is great! I have a monthly membership and it's so worth the money. I take my car in about once a week for a wash and vacuum. Having the membership helps me keep my car fresh on the inside, and fresh on the outside. 😉💦💯🚗< /text>

We're utilizing advanced pieces of software and equipment as well as high-quality bio-degradable chemicals. All to provide you with a clean, dry, and shiny car.\n\nWe love how much our vacuums suck as well! However, occasionally trash and other objects might clog up the vacuum nozzle. If you ever encounter a vacuum with little to no suction, please notify a member of our staff and we'll be more than happy to clear up the issue for you. We hope to provide you with more positive experiences in the future.\n\n- The Eco Express team"}<//response>

Excellent place to get your vehicle washed. Friendly staff, and the drive through machine does a great job on my RAM 1500....especially due to the fact that I also have tunneau cover too, and a lot of other car wash places miss that area of my truck.< /text>

Not bad for a quick wash with light dust or dirt. I tried this place because I was in a hurry and figured I'd try it. The first wash would not remove the rain water stains. The manager was nice enough to let me go through again, but I would've been better off getting a refund.

Employees were nice and the self-vacuum/drying stations are nice. But not a very thorough wash.</Text>

I got the 6 dollar basic car wash, that does a pretty good job. The blowers do a decent job of drying, but there are areas that must be wiped. The compressed air hoses are very low pressure, and vacuum hoses have a crevice attachment,  not good for carpets.<//Text>

The car wash looks nice and has fancy flashing lights, in addition the staff were friendly. However, the wash was mediocre at best. The compressed air had no real pressure. There is no pre-wash before entering and the blowers are ineffective. Will not return!</review>

<Review>i do a lot of running around and my car is always dirty, I love this place because they have a membership, the air guns and vacuum's are strong and new, they keep the entire place really clean. I love doing my own car after. The service people are really nice as well and helpful. You can buy an individual wash or get an un-limited membership. welcome to Temecula guys!< /Review>< UserId.>

If you ever encounter a vacuum with little to no suction, please notify a member of our staff and we'll be more than happy to clear up the issue for you. We hope to serve you again soon!\n\n- The Eco Express team"}< /Response>

I was walking through the mall.  I'll blame it on my light lunch!  I walked by and could not help myself! Saw the big bright sign that was calling me.  Decided to order regular Philly cheesesteak with fries and a soda!  Tasted so good after I chomped it down after taking some pics!  About 11 dollars for a meal.  Waited for them to freshly make my sandwich!<//text>

This shop is not so awesome, but their quality is stable and the shop is clean. Also, staffs are fine. Then, the location is great. You can reach here easily from Powell Bart station because it is located in Westfield mall. My recommendation is a small size Philly cheesesteak sandwich.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLjkxY_8uh9Mf03e0wKci3st0O4VsA0e1QHhNS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlZLTPUAuPzWsrL3g1pSeZHrSCd0wXo6oI5T6M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1566048204808, 'text': 'Thanks for reaching out to us about your time spent with us, Yumiko.

< Review>
I do enjoy a decent Philly Cheese Steak (however it is written or spelt by the shop!) and this was very decent and very enjoyable. Staff had the usual vacant stare that let's you know that you are part of a process rather than an individual customer, but I will go back!< /Review>

I really love a hot Charleys sandwich. The fries and sandwich are always good but y'all need to get a better health score number. 78 is not a good enough health score. The employees give off the "underpaid and overworked" vibe but I don't blame them, I blame the franchisee owner or corporate.</text>

Went on 11/10. Horrible customer service here. Employees were extremely rude, weren’t helpful at all. This place dosen’t even deserve one star. Left a terrible first impression on me. Owner needs to fire everyone here. Will never return.<//review>

Coming to Charley's Grilled Subs for the first time was a very wise choice on my part. The food is absolutely amazing and the delivery of the food was very quick despite the long lines that the place receives. Their subs are handled each individual with attention to detail to ensure that customers are always satisfied and begging for more. If I had to recommend a sub place in the area, I would absolutely put this place down first.<//text>

When im in the city for work i love to eat at charleys. On the backs of all the receipts they give you a survey where you can get a fry and free drink with your purchase of a sub. The costumer service is nice as well.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Service is fast! The beef is full of fried, remember to eat hot. A little expensive, girls with small food intake suggest small size:)

<text>Excellent grounds, management is top notch. Mature and quiet living experience. The maintenance crew's response speed is second to none. Very spacious units with modern design and tons of storage. Close to the airport, nightlife, shopping and major transportation. Great place to live in the San Jose area.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fcc991f1a36b1:0xd90c80a6d7186913< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Old apartments with less amenities (gym & pool). For the same rent, you can get better and newer apartments in downtown. Though its gated, most of times the doors are not closed. Management didn’t fix this during my 1 year tenure of stay. AC is in living room only. Only best part is large store in patio.<//Review>

Cons
- Very poor management team.
- They will keep your deposit no matter what and charge you even more when you move out.
- They charge you for everything, water, hot water, gas, trash, parking, and a lot of other fees so you should add at least $250 + rent.
- Good look trying to find another parking if you have 2 cars.
- Cars getting broken into all the time, and security is just a joke here.
- Getting packages is almost impossible. You will have to go and get them yourself from the local postal office. My packages are getting lost all the time.
- Everything is about money here and I truly mean it.

Pros,
- Clean apartments.
-  Washer and dryer in unit.< /Review>

<Review>I had a really rough go around at Villa Torino. They did not give me any security deposit back, when I left the apartment in perfect condition and I had to leave the area due to COVID, which the management team did not care at all about.

In the time I lived there, the management team was horrible. I had a few packages I needed to pick up 30 minutes before the office closed, and one of the managers was rushing me and frustrated that I was picking my items up close to closing time, because his dog had surgery that week...

I also received calls from the management team that my rent was not paid, when it was and the payment was processing. Definitely scary to get phone calls that your rent wasn't paid for in such tough times...

It's a nice apartment complex, but not worth the trouble from the staff and the outrageous rent and lease break penalties. But I guess they're smart in that sense, they absolutely screwed me and made a ton of money off me. When I need to move back to the area, I will not choose Villa Torino and I do not recommend Villa Torino.</Review><Name>Brandon Layser< /Name><Pictures>None</Pictures><date>1607785778648</date></record></dataset><record>

Lived at Villa Torino for almost 2 years now. The staff at the office are helpful and nice. The only complaint I have is if you live next to the bridge towards Coleman it can get a bit noisy due to construction and with the complex being close to the airport. Otherwise, the apartments are very spacious with high ceilings, clean, and maintenance comes through every time.<//Review>

I am not sure where to start with this. After living here for 2.5 years, I am adjusting my initial review. Moving out has been a nightmare for my wife and I. All they care about is your money and they will try their best to charge you as much as they could possibly get out of you. Even though the apartment was left in good and clean condition, they are still taking all of our deposit and even charging us more. Due to some issues we had to break our lease which is understandable that we had to pay thousands in fees, but to take all of our deposit and charging us more was not expected. There are so many issues with VT apartments such as parking or even getting your mail is almost impossible, but also there are some positives such good maintenance team , and having a washer and dryer in unit. I would not recommend anyone who value their comfort and money to move to this place as they have such an unethical approach and also keep in mind that you will have to pay additional $300 - $400 for fees on top of your rent.< /text>

Staff is sometimes rude when it comes to delivering packages or other things. They failed to present the invoice for each charge when asked for and replied rudely. How can we even believe that you are charging us honestly when you are unable to show the proof.</review><GmapID>0x808fcc991f1a36b1:0xd90c80a6d7186913< /GmapID>< Rating>

Getting packages here is an absolute disaster. They will Nickle and dime you on the way out, lost a lot of the deposit. There was a flood i didnt recognize until i moved in.. Charged me 100 dollars to paint a few small holes in the wall. Charged for steam cleaning for the one small room that had carpet we slept in. Had our place professionally cleaned btw. As expensive as this place is, the only thing they upgraded was their office building. The gates are constantly broken in the gated community also security was talked about, never happened and needed desperately. The worst exp. I have ever had. I can say maintenence is very responsive, if thats all that matters, you're set!< /Text>

Community is very clean and safe. Management always look after the security of the apartments. Every request is handled through online portal and turn around time is very less.< /text>

I have been in San Jose Downtown for past 4 years. I have moved to many new places here. But, out of all those places - I find Villa Torrino is the best of all. The management team is very good too.<//Review>

I love living at Villa Torino. The community is great. The grounds are lovely and it's nice to be able to enjoy the hot tub and pool day or night year round. The community room is wonderful for hosting things like game nights, brunch, collage nights or workshops even. I have had the pleasure of reserving these rooms which also allows my friends to enjoy Villa Torino.<//text>

<Review>I viewed this apartment when I was looking at housing options recently. Overall, a good, older apartment complex. A few things to consider - the place is located in between the light rail and the entrance ramp to the freeway. When I was there (during the morning), I could hear the freeway noise outside, but not while I was inside the inner apartment. It's a matter of location, location. Overall, a good option.</Review>< Rate>

I have been renting a 1 beth-1bath apartment since 2015 and I decided to renew my lease since then. From the neighborhood which is pretty well located and convenient, to the amenities offered. The maintenance staff is friendly as well as the main office Managers. The place has really nice amenities like the gym, pool and jacuzzi. When it comes to reception of packages, the office have an organized system to receive the packages and inform residents when received. I highly recommend renting an apartment in Villa Torino.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><rating>5</rating><gmapID>0x808fcc991f1a36b1:0xd90c80a6d7186913< /gmapID><username>María Florencia Dutto</username>< Response>

Been here for a year now! Love living here and the management staff are extremely polite, sweet and accomodating. The apartments are very spacious, with high ceilings, and the amount of space they provide is definitely luxury! The interior gardening and amenities are gorgeous! Everything and I mean everything fun and essential is close by, max 8 minute drive. Entertainment, lots of grocery store locations: Target, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Safeway, College Park Plaza,  San Pedro Square, lots of fun places to go to downtown. The place is located downtown, thus some things are to be expected while living downtown, like making sure to never leave anything in your car, and buying extra chains for your bike. Those things are unavoidable due to where the apartment is placed, and the apartment managers and the VT community do a great job communicating to each other for any suspicious activity, to minimize the problems.</review>

First thing first: All the 5 and 4 star ratings that you see here, were sponsored by the property manager! The property incentivize residents in return for high ratings on yelp.

Pros: Close to Downtown San Jose.

Cons:
1. Majority of the tenants in this complex are students from San Jose State University. 7-8 individuals living in a single apartment.
Irrespective of time of day/night, there is always somebody on the phone in the patio or the corridor/hallways/Balconies or on the street below your apartment. Every night there is a frat party. There are Loud and obnoxious neighbor.

2. The property manager(E) and her assistant(G) are racist AF. Anytime you go to them with a complaint, they argue with you and it always end up in a verbal argument. They always retaliate with an eviction notice for minor little thing. Sooner or later you start complaining  in the fear of retaliation.

3. Poor Security: There has always been security issues at Villa Torino. The Management has failed to address these issues over the past years. Instead of improving security, the spent money on the look and feel of the community and even renovating the leasing office. The cost of adding security cameras and a DVR is much less compared to the amount they have spent on the effing planters. Every year, during the tax season the mailboxes get broken into. Apartments have been broken into in broad daylight. Residents have been attacked by homeless. Homeless have been seen wandering around in the community on several occasion. Bike and other items have been stolen from the patio/balconies of the apartments(even 3rd floor apartments!). Cars are broken into in the parking garage almost every month. The main entrances of the building are always broken and the locks don't work. There is an "off campus" security company, every time you call them, they show up more than an hour later. The tenants security is the lowest priority for EL and Gr.

4. AirBnb: At one point of time, the community had at least 3 apartments available on AirBnb. The management (Eli and Gre) were fully aware of these units, but they chose not to take any action(who knows what they got in return). There were random guests(of all kind) staying in those BnBs. The management had to shut it down after some backlash. They might have moved to VRBO or some thing else.

5. Appliances: Old and barely works. The dryers in the apartments are so old, it takes 2-3 cycles to dry your clothes. The Dish washer is a totally different beast(in a negative sense).

6. Elevators: Majority of the time the elevators in the community are broken and under repair. (Imagine carrying your Costco groceries up the stairs.)

7. Gym: Small overcrowded gym full of residents who lack basic gym etiquette.

8. Rules : The rules which are laid out by the management, change very frequently. The same set of rules don't apply to all the apartments. The management is lenient towards some apartments while the others get eviction notice.

9. Security Deposit: Needless to say, when moving out, don't have any expectation of getting any of security deposit back. They keep the security deposit in the name of "cleaning", even if they renovate the whole apartment after you move out.

Overall, these days there are a lot more options in Downtown San Jose. Pay $50-100 more, but stay away from Villa Torino and their rude Property Managers (Elis** and Greg).<//review>

<review>I am in the process of signing a lease at Villa Torino. The management staff here has been very friendly and helpful in showing me around the complex and understanding my requirements.

When I was filling my application, I called the office to make an enquiry, but since my call wasn't answered, I did not complete the process. However, the rent for the same unit shot up considerably the following day. The management staff were quite responsive towards my queries and additionally offered to honor the original price I started my application for.

I am quite happy with the service and can't wait to live in this wonderful community at the heart of Downtown SJ.< /review><rating>5<//rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Tulika Saraf< /name>< gmap_id>

<review>Lived here for a year; Air conditioner was undersized and not adequate to cool the apartment; Construction on flower beds next to my window lasted for more than 6 months; no compensation; and they raised my rent. The other thing that was annoying is that the location is an AT&T cellular dead zone... which impacted my business. Also, the Homeless from Saint James park regularly visit the facility; break into cars; even stole a bike off a 3rd floor balcony... would not recommend. high staff turnover; the newest batch is rude...the utilities...they nickel and dime you for everything...they are definitely taking advantage of renters in a tight market..<//review>< user_name>

They false advertise cheap apartments, then they tell you it's only available through BMR. When I asked their representative to show me where the fine print was, of course he couldnt find it and blamed it on Zillow. Real nice...< /text>

Loved the apartment and was ready to take it. Then spoke to the manager. She never smiled, very rude and talking to me as though I will not pass the credit check.
Two young ladies came to take a new lease when their old one runs out. The manager rude shouted at them to first finish your old lease then come back and we will think of releasing.

I decided to choose another location. Better than deal with this for the next 12 months.<//Text>

Pro's: location near to a lot of restaurants/bars, nice swimming pool area, spacious apartments, friendly staff.

Cons: Outdated apartments, security/theft is a big issue here (bikes, cars, other items get regularly stolen by outsiders), Gym is outdated.

I give them 2 stars because for the rent prices you expect better security, especially in a down town area. Having your self and your belongings secured is more important to me than some of the pro's.</Text>

<Review>First time eating here and came with the family. There was a lot to choose from even for drinks. We settled on a few dishes that were recommended by the cashier. Food was fresh, delicious and I thought it was priced well. We ate everything!!! Only suggestion I would recommend is to turn music down a bit. Just at least until we’re over with these mask. It’s hard at hearing with the mask on, with the music blaring too it just makes it even harder. I felt the cashier was a bit short with us on taking our order- it was because she couldn’t hear us and we couldn’t hear her. We noticed every one after was responding the same too. 😬 Other than that, we’ll definitely come back!< /Review>< rate>

This place is my favorite. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this restaurant I  constantly return again and again. The team is very welcoming and the cooking they cook is so fresh and tasty. I am always happy to have a good dinner in this place. I highly recommend this place.<//text>

<Text>Terrible customer service.
I stood next to the register and waited for my to-go order for 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the staff. I understand they might be short-staffed and there was a lunch rush but you don't just walk past customers without at least acknowledging their presence it's awful customer service.
The food isn't very good. The French Fries had no season and they were lukewarm.
Overall this place disappointed me and ruined my lunch break. I won't be going back.< /Text>< Pictures>

Flavorful and creative Korean/Asian fusion served here. The "burgers" with the crispy rice buns are fun and taste great, but good luck eating it without making a mess. You're going to need a fork to eat the umami fries, but they are delicious. I've only done takeout here - it was easy to order over the phone and the staff were helpful in their suggestions. The only issue I had was finding parking downtown near the restaurant to run in and get my order.<//Review>

I've had their bowls/salads a few times but then a few weeks back I tried their chicken sandwich.  I've been back weekly for it since.  It is too big for me by myself,  but half will make me happy, but not too sleepy to finish the day.  Would recommend, but beware it is addictive<//Review>

Looking for something different and decided to give this place a try. Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and Kamikaze frys. Sandwich was crispy and tasty, fries could of been a little warmer, but I had to walk a bit back to work, so probably cooled before getting there. Definitely was good and will order again.< /Review>

<rate>2</rate><Text>Raw bacon on their Masubi Supreme. The fat was still white. What chef would serve bacon with white fat on it. And no sauce, the rice was falling apart, should have used more seaweed to wrap such a monstrosity of a masubi.

The kamikaze fries were cold and stale. Like the potatoes were not cooked fresh.

I ordered online, went to pick it up at the appointed time, but was told it would be another 5 minutes. Waited 10 minutes actually to get sub par food.

Saw and tasted the ingredients and I could make this at home myself.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-KHbfuyK2dO93Cx0Otnmfk3NQb5mNKaEvWXz1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQy0yagZ-EX-dgcWKsqANwRQaTv0KVpzuhF5iB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

I went up to the counter and they told me another 5 minutes after waiting over 25 minutes. I continued waiting another 15 minutes. After this I had enough. I asked for a refund as I needed to be back at work. They didn't ask for my card and said they would start refunding. While this was happening they call my order number. I told them I still want my order but it seemed like they didn't want to give it to me. I opted to cancel because I was waiting so long but since my order was FINALLY called I want it. I got it and I was out, no more time to waste as I had to go back to work. This was bad chsomter service. This was during a busy lunch hour but they completed my friends order in less than 15 minutes.  When I got back to work I found that they had given me a sandwich as well. I don't know if they messed up the order but I'm not going back to return this after waiting so long for my order.

This little eatery is the perfect addition to the K st  mall. I had the spare ribs burger. Bun made of rice (yes actual grains of rice) and instead of a a circular meat patty, you get big savory chunks of rib meat. So good.
Great place to stop before a show at Golden 1, or after a show. I bet lunch would be amazing as well. There is even a space age bar down stairs. Check them out</Review>

The wait was a little long but in fairness there were a lot of people there. The food was delicious and well worth the wait. Braised pork, two delicious over-easy eggs on top, fish egg hidden throughout, and a large lovely salad. Very filling, so much better than getting a mushy old burrito at Chipotle anytime, and just a bit cheaper too!<//review>

<review>Always tasty! Today I tried the Teriyaki Zen Koja Burger. I have to say, for a vegan burger, it was pretty damn good! Pro tip: ask for garlic aioli to dip your fries in!< /review>< rate>

The food is so delicious, the wine and beer is economically priced, and when you have your burger try it with the rice bun mmmm delicious. Oh yes and there's a bar with a quiet cozy scene downstairs<//text>

<review>1st finally trying this location here and its during covid-19.
Set up was clean and distance was easy.
Used the self kiosk to place the order and pay.

Food came out pretty good, and we had it togo.

Kamikaze fries were great. Love the waffle fries and the sweet bulgolgi beef then mixed with the SRIRACHA sauce.  Love the sweet heat factor.

Chicken tacos are a must each time we come to a koja kitchen. Something about the wasabi flavor on it makes me want one everytime I visit.

Bulgolgi beef bun burger with added egg was good. Love their rice buns but having it in a bun held up better, but still good either way you try it.

The pulled pork bowl was ok, the coconut on the pork gives it such a great taste,and the salad was mostly dry cause the dressing ended up in the rice, that was not to good.

Not sure but the masago was missing on 3 items. Not sure what happened, wasn't told it was out.

Cool spot, good food like other kojas.

They do sell masks here, from re-usable to one time uses. And a few colors too. During covid-19.</review>< pics>

I came here as a yelp Elite invited guest.   The restaurant is right at the k Street light rail...so you will need to park a block away...which is not too far.

The entrance to the restaurant is through the black iron fence...there is no side entrance.

The staff is friendly and greeted me upon arrival. They were very busy...yeah for them.

There is inside and outdoor seating whichever you prefer.

I was able to try the Korean Buffalo wing...soy garlic wing...kamikaze fries...crispy chicken nuggets...and braised pork bowl.

The wings had great flavor...not as crispy as I like.  The Korean Buffalo sauce definitely had heat with a little sweet...it was so good...I just wished they were more crispy...

The kamikaze fries...mmm. they start with a bed of crispy criss cross fries...then they are topped with minced Korean BBQ beef...oh my goodness the flavor was so good...COUPLED with kitchen red sauce..if you don't like spicy...ask them to hold the spice...Japanese mayo and green onions...these are very filling and delicious.

Crispy chicken nuggets...these are so good. I really liked the batter on them they were crispy and tender.  These are brined in sake...and they put a drizzle of honey Sriracha sauce on them...I wished there was more sauce...it was that good...

The braised pork bowl...now this was my favorite...oh my goodness...the pork is braised in a miso coconut broth...then it's coupled with a garlic aioli...and other things...

The meat is kind of like a shredded meat with everything mixed in and served with white rice.

The food here is so delicious...

The also sell boba teas..lemonade and soda...beer ect.

If your downtown around 9th and k street...you should try this place...</Text>

(Translated by Google) My food was not really warm and didn't taste great either. The restaurant itself was unfortunately not exactly clean either.

(Original)
Mein Essen war nicht wirklich warm und hat auch nicht überragend geschmeckt. Das Lokal selbst war leider ebenfalls nicht gerade sauber.</Review>

<review>Food is great! Price is reasonable. Servers are friendly. Not so crowded, unlike some other places that are closer to the city center. But I still wouldn’t recommend you to go there on a busy night. It can be a bit slow and messy because they don’t have enough people.</review>< Pictures>

The restaurant has changed hands a few times, the food mostly stays delicious. Consider the experience and dishes to be at the same level as an affordable Chinese restaurant. Try the scalloped potatoes, steam fish and fried beans. The teas served are good as well.< /Text>

Authentic Chinese food, with northeastern Chinese dishes that are hard to find in the states. Great price and proportions. Would recommend!<//Text>

< Review>
Confusing online menu, it's in English but badly-translated and neither I nor my wife (a native Chinese speaker) can figure out what the dishes are; it would be better to put the Chinese name beside each one so we can read it ourselves.

Phone ordering is confusing: the staff often don't know what dishes are available even if it's something we've gotten here before (happens even if we order in Chinese).

Frequent issues with the credit card machine, sometimes this causes you to have to wait a while and your food gets cold.

The food is good but we might not order again because it's just too hard to order and pick up.</Review>

The dishes are fresh and delicious!!!
Most importantly, the price is soooo affordable compared with other restaurants. Highly recommended!!!😄 If you are from Northeast China, you should try 锅包肉，熏肉大饼。like home.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>* Must-try dishes:
- House Special Combination Spicy Pot, mussel, beef, lotus ... you keep finding surprises in the pot and it is a 1+1 bigger than 2 combination;
- Li Lian Gui Smoked Pork Pancake, must have signature that I order every time;
- Boiled Pork Meat w/Spicy Sauce, this is an ordinary Chinese but this place makes it great.

* Cost: $15~25/person

* 5-star reason: The taste of the dishes are so good and the price is so low, let alone a free milk tea. Definitely a five star.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>They have this lady working in the Kitchen and she is loud!!!
You can hear her all over the dinning room area.
Beside the atmosphere is bad cause of the loud noise.
The food have gone up in price $$$ and Portion have gone smaller and smaller.
They change the table but the place is still very dirty (check for yourself).
If the owner doesn't change I don't think they will be in business very long...

Too loud
Too Dirty
Too bad not recommend to eat
Not sure how they pass the food inspection cause as you walk in and see the floor next to the front door and a stand up refrigerator you see what I mean...</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fb504a24bdcd3:0xd0faac38627c8bc6</gmap_id></record>

<Review>We tried: 3 cup chicken, salt and pepper pork, and clay pot beef?
3 cup chicken = too sweet and not savory enough.  (I recommend Red Hot Wok for this dish)
Salt and pepper Pork = onions were delicious according to my onion aficionado, not sure if that's really a good thing because to me, it was just onions.The pork needed more S n P.
Clay pot beef = onions, red and green bell peppers, beef all seasoned with a heavy hand of black bepper.  The clear winner of the 3, but still just mediocre.

Decor: none
Service: they'll come to you when you signal them
Speed: it's 2am, nothings moving as fast as you wish
Specials: 3 orders to go is $20 (cash only) is a great deal!
Menu: lots of options, love that they use pictures!
Overall, they close at 3am and won't call the cops on you for being drunk, laughing historically, and eating their food.< /Review><Time>1436332532909</Time></record></dataset><record>

Even take away, they give you the big portion (if you order from their main menu) But if you eat in, a single dish is like a portion for a family of 4 lol. The flavor is very distinct and not Americanised. Special fried rice is soo good. Not oily and full of flavor. All their food isn't oily at all. I hope this place stays in business!<//text>< Pictures>

Tells me to hold. Then says call back in 5 minutes?!? I said no you can take my order for pick up. He then replied "I have things to do." Then hung up. I immediately called back & then he took my order? Lol very weird</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb504a24bdcd3:0xd0faac38627c8bc6<//Gmap_id></record>

Return visit after an absence of a couple years. Standards have really gone down. The quality of the flavors not there and food was just so-so. I suspect there has been a change in the kitchen staff which is reflected in change in menu.< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Tasty food, HUGE portions, at very affordable prices. Some favorites are "fried chicken" small fried chicken, Mushu pork Northeast Mushu pork, fish with vegetables seasonal dish fish fillet, seafood tofu seafood tofu, and Chongqing style spicy chicken 辣子鸡. Packed up nicely for takeout. Usually have leftovers good for a couple more meals!

(Translated by Google) Bad, absolutely bad reviews. I went to lunch on Sunday 2 weeks ago. I have more people and have a seat. Into the store, first ask a few of us, learn 2 people, tell us that there is no location. This kind of store will definitely not go.

(Original)
差劲，绝对差评。2周前周日去吃午餐，吃饭人多，有位子。进店，先问我们几个人，得知2人，告诉我们没有位置。这种店家，绝对不会在去的。</Review>

In the evening, the air-conditioning in the restaurant was not strong enough.

<Time>1622454837486<//Time><rating>5<//rating><text>It was my fiance Don's very FIRST TIME at Jimmy Johns. I've loved you guys since 2001 wayyyyy back in Alexandria, Minnesota. After a little hesitation and finally finding a store that was close and open we FINALLY made it thru the drive thru of Jimmy Johns!! I am happy to report he loved it just like I do!!! Unfortunately, Don has fallen so ill due to extremely bad asthma and asthmatic attacks!! I've been out of work to care for him and it's been hard on both of us. If I were still working I'd bring him JJ's every night or every day for lunch but I just can't afford it right now. Thanks for making a day we had together special!!!!< /text>< pictures>

<review>I had the number 10 sandwich which was the double roast beef with provolone cheese. This was my first time eating here and I have to say this has one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten!!! The restraunt was super clean and the employees were so friendly! The environment is meant to bring a smile to your face! The signs in the bathroom were some of my favorite!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNM4J7QZFZXEelpVlaANswbcPUtZ8SjYvprHvJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAM3Hsa9h9HmJevvtPN18ExKMpDuUx2iiLURsS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZFuhZbKdzA6LU4aIBLuFB3HgMgdVE6Mb0b7kO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtkGxUctGfS2T9wU7_sfKy8aem-ExNKWpiz-Ho=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8vEBTc4TBVVtdKOpVnp8B8tAg9f8Xwvv-D--w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAHQrgJBMiwv6FF1LNvordt8FT98U0TYxA_Fxh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCsW8_BQy70Pyzt-GabZLbiu6OrdnW0fTeZ0qM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBeBtiFFOQqeiIY6oWkbQbaB0gNCnei4r9KDgI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjVMKyD2reONNB-df-zwXFVmQQ2DSsLUuUyVcq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWOqI0RqKje_sznP5d75Leji4fh_krdbsRTWSr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNory0KxwA39OubnKK8X_lMjPGeQaHYkof2dtHr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTuFFnarw52yY0tlrXGTK52igb2JTy0RU7gIuZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrEfd6Ma9QC0T4wG_77bSRowbAyYJFX_WG183n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM47M2c1gyKEfRdxWWciUloqO3OqEy4xdbFePKr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSiDXTfRb1hA0ZHB2GJmF15tjUsyMQiCgHcTp3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcYjcqPJbuTbts8e2LfSsKkQbZcMUVst5KhMIX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9-knetVbK9nQj2CnmqVooQuracYfztJpn9uPy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMegYtlhBF3XBTxE6VX7agoKalAXauaUgdJTjUF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmQrjLo8Qdnh3A42O94X0np2FhVbfs0_cDSp5V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>Lovely services and employees. Had the ham with provolone, adding lettuce and mayonnaise. I get it every time and is the bomb 👏🏼. Large selection of chips. Some baked, cheesy, and salt and vinegar. Would definitely come back and recommend.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<username>Tim Bruton</username><gmap_id>0x80dcd3f8e4106191:0xb1659e551beadc5b</gmap_id><Text>Delicious tacos with unique cheesy shells. If you haven't tried these uniqee tacos, you are in for a treat. The first time that I ate a Jimmy John's taco was a pleasant surprise.
They are very filling, so you should be hungry when you go. There are good deals on 6 packs and other variety items. The hamburger meat is very good for the first sample. The pork is actually pretty good too, and I'm not usually a fan of pork.
The seating is a little noisy with the concrete floor and glass windows. Eat outside if the weather is nice. The air conditioning vents will give you a chill of you sit right under an air duct.
There are televisions placed in several locations but it's too loud to hear them and the closed caption is not on. They are turned up quite loud too, so if you sit under one of them, be prepared for a sound blast.
Once I sat under a TV and an air conditioning duct, so needless to say, it was a short visit. One taco and it was time to head outside. That was uncomfortable!
The drink machine is serve yourself with a lot of choices, so that's good for soda drinkers. There is also tea and less sugary drinks.
There are several types of salsa to try as well. The green is very flavorful and the medium red is a good choice.
Get the app to enjoy deals and on line discounts. The Jimmy John's loyalty program is worth signing up for. Hopefully there is one within driving range of your home or work.
Enjoy!< /Text>< response>

Favorite sub sandwich shop, #11 is favorite
All the shops seems to be franchises, so great service at one location might not equal another.
I’ve been to this location numerous times, it’s always been great at this location.<//text>

My first time going. Ordered the LULU, didn't put bacon. It's the whole point. Turkey and bacon. Also I added avocado and cheese which is 2 extra dollars. Only on half and barely any avocado. Horrible. I will never go back.< /Text>

Worse customer service I’ve experienced. I walked in for my lunch hour as I walked in no greetings no nothing there was one guy only waiting for his order I stood in front of the menu looking and I was ready to order stood there again waiting told myself they might be busy with the drive thru ok I waited more and a girl walks in she gets greeted by the manager or whatever he was and told her something else they had ran out. He proceeds to ask one of the guys to take her order and I just stood there in awe like are you serious right now I’ve been here in front of the counter waiting for someone to greet me or take my order. I just walked out I wanted to say something like hey I was here before her why are you taking her order but I just didn’t not with that kind of service.< /text>

A lot of unreasonable rules. You don't need use mask for cardio but you have to use for other machines in same space. Between them couple foots. Before pandemic, they never let turn off fans, everybody had to work with wind, so cold, reason "stop seperate viruses". Now they don't let turn on fans, reason "may cause separate Covid 19". They don't have idea about viruses or sport, l couldn't understand</review>

<text>I dont understand how my kids will learn gymnastics when the coaches just tell them to do a move once and expect them to perfect it in 4 sessions. They dont even teach on how to do the move if they are struggling they just supervise and say "good". My kids have been held back 3 times now because they cant do a cart wheel...then teach them how to do a cart wheel! Last time I sign my kids up for this program.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1606168962500, 'text': 'Hi Adrian, thanks for sharing your concern. We certainly don’t expect our gymnasts to learn a new skill within four practices either! We believe our gymnastics director reached out to you personally directly after this message to better explain our combined recreation classes and levels (particularly while we navigate through COVID requirements and changes), as well as to offer a complete progress report. We also understand that six months off of gymnastics for everyone means we focus on rebuilding strength, flexibility and more. One last quick thought that we employ with our recreational gymnasts: If there are a few mandatory skills that hold them back, there is opportunity for private lessons for 1-to-1 attention. With the wide range of skills and other details to focus on, often times it’s difficult to spend an extended amount of time on one skill in a group setting. We hope this information helps – and we hope your daughter may still be interested in continuing her gymnastics journey!'}</Response>< GmapID>

The water slide area is great. They've made a lot of renovations. It's much better. I don't care for the kids area as much because the infants are sectioned off in the same room as the bigger kids. I think they should have their own separate room.</text>

Gym is ok, but do not come here if you need a functional locker room. They recently "renovated" it and it has regressed to the point of unusable. Lockers the size of a shoebox hold nothing. Sinks with no counter space, and no shelving in showers to hold soap or other basic items. Locker room looks pretty but is not functional in any way. If the YMCA paid even a dime for this renovation, they were ripped off. I will be driving the extra 20 minutes and going to McGrath.<//review>

Disappointed with the remodel. Upstairs could have been laid out more effectively and I get that it's a family center but the weight room wasnt given much thought. However, can't really complain due to its proximity to home.<//review>

So happy with this place! They are all so nice and very down to earth people. The child watch really puts me at ease while I workout. We have the best swim instructor (Miss Courtney!) And will be very sad if we ever had to leave.<//Review>

<review>I have always enjoyed coming here. The prices were great but they recently changed the non Santee resident price to $9 a person. It's a bit much if you're just driving over from Lakeside. Otherwise the Lifeguard staff is great. The wait time was great. The pool was clean and I like that the lifeguards do rotations to ensure none of them get too sleepy and Nod off. I cannot contribute a photo because you're not allowed to take photos inside. I'm not complaining because I understand why but it would be nice to take a picture of your kids playing.<//review>< Pics>

Great for kids. Equipment is ok for the average beginner to weight lifting. Sharing is big because there is only 1 squat rack. Classes are fun. Staff is kind and helpful. Strict dress code though which makes it a little uptight. I'd recommend it if you have young children. Great summer programs</Text>

We went to the splash pad on Sunday sep 30.  There were many kids there and on one side were several little white blond kids and my brown son.  Every time the various kids would do something such as jump, the whistle was only blown at him.  One time the lifeguard was telling him something and the two girls did the exact same whilst he was talking with no notice.  I appreciate safety rules as we are law enforcement family but maybe apply rules to more than the brown kids.</Text>

Terrible place to take your kids swimming! Not enough chairs, pool always crowded, zombies for staff. We went and paid 24 dollars for me and my 2 kids to swim for about an 1 hour and a half before they close (for cleaning) until 3:30 and they open up again. We couldn’t even do that since they had a poop in the pool emergency and kicked us out of the pool. Did they refund my money? Nope. Swallowed those funds up and gave us guest passes, as if we want to go back there again. Avoid like the plague! McGrath YMCA near us is better.<//Text>

2-star specifically for non-members/non-resident activity pool. Went here today for the first time with the wife, the grandparents, and two kids (2 and 4.5) for the 12:30-2:30 session. Now, once we got in we had an absolute blast, but the 2-star review is due to our awful experience before we entered the pool area (considered 1-star but wanted to factor in that we did have a fun time in the water). NON-MEMBERS: BE ADVISED. LONG LINE WAITS. Not to be dramatic, but at one point while we were waiting in line it was so bad my 4.5 year old started crying and said, "Dad, can we please just leave and go to the water front park?" (And it wasn't a typical 4-year-old bratty/whining cry. It was a genuine sad/disappointed cry.) Basically what happened was, we got there at Noon and were close to the front of the "Non-member" line, but we didn't get in to the actual pool area until 1pm, and that was only because at 12:50 (20 minutes after the the session opened) I went up to the lifeguard who was processing everyone (members) in and asked her when they were going to start to also process the non-members. She said that she was going to process all of the members first before she started the non-members (which at the rate things were going and how many members there still were in line we MAYBE would have gotten into the pool at 1:30.) So I asked her to double check with a supervisor on their policy (because if that were the case we would've left.) Thankfully she checked because when she came back they started processing the non-members as well. All that to say, it was a very stressful and very disappointing way to start off what (thankfully) ended up being a fun afternoon at the pool. And although it ended up being fun, unless they change their process or non-member/resident price, I don't plan on going back. It's just not worth it for price, wait in line, and limited time alowed inside. I get that members/residents have priority, but still..it doesn't need to be this bad. (Maybe process people who are in line early and have a separate staging area where people who are already processed can wait and then go right in when the session starts?) Last comment...I feel like most of the disappointment could've been avoided if they communicated better and put on their website "non-member spots limited. Arrive early. Expect long waits. Cost is for one 2-hour session only" Unless I missed it, nowhere did the website communicate any of that. Please let me know if you improve the non-member check in process! Would love to come back if you do!<//Text>

I used to love their water aerobics program.  But it has become very crowded and the instructors do not show us seniors how to modify the exercises.  For years I went to the Mission Beach Plunge for water aerobics and the instructors were very knowledgeable and understood that exercising in the water is a slower pace than doing the exercises on the deck of the pool.  Plus, they synced the music with the exercises.  This group of instructors seem to be someone they pulled in off the street that needed a job with little to no experience.  Sad that this is not the program it once was.<//review>

Cameron Family YMCA is a great option for a health club. It has a pool, a work out room, a cardio area, and a gymnastics floor. They offer classes from mild to wild. I love doing cardio on the machines here. All my kids learned to swim here.<//review>

Was treated like a second hand citizen. Don't go here unless you're already a member. I'm a non member we waited in a separate line. While members AND non members are going through the member line and getting in. My 7 month old daughter and I are waiting in a line that isn't moving for 20+ minutes after opening in the sun. We came here to cool off.i got here early. Also school busses are showing up and getting in the member line. Every time the member line is done, more members show up and walk right in. Not sure how long they expect us to wait out here before they let us in. I do not plan on coming back.< /Text>

AFTER HAVING A MEMBERSHIP THERE FOR OVER 10 YEARS I HAD TO TAKE A YEAR OFF DUE TO A LOWER LOMBER SPINAL INJURY AND WHEN I WANTED TO COME BACK TO VISIT ON A SUNDAY BEFORE I COULD RENEW MY MEMBERSHIP THE SUNDAY MANAGER BREE MURRAY WOULD NOT LET ME USE THE POOL WITHOUT PAYING THE JOINING FEE AND PAYING TO RENEW MY MEMBERSHIP...CLOSE TO $100. SHE WOULD NOT ISSUE ME A GUEST PASS EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER FOR SO LONG. SO I WANT EVERYONE TO REMEMBER HER NAME....."BREE MURRAY".......NOT A CARING PERSON...."BREE MURRAY".... DOES NOT STAND FOR WHAT I THOUGHT THE YMCA STOOD FOR WHICH IS CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY......SHE DOES NOT....." BREE MURRAY"...... NOT A LOVING PERSON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SIMPLE FOR HER TO LET ME SWIM FOR MY WELL BEING. SHE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT MY WELL BEING "BREE MURRAY"......."BREE MURRAY"............... "BREE MURRAY"........"BREE MURRAY" ...     SHE WONT CARE ABOUT YOU EITHER.</Review>

My family and I signed up for this YMCA because they have a water park. My kids love playing on the structure and splashing around in the water. They also have a very interactive daycare where you can take your kids while you work out. They take they kids on local excursions and the staff are very kind to the kids.< /review>

The gym is small, dark and outdated... apparently there's a dress code too. We were told mid drifts were to be covered, which it was, but you could see the sides of my waist and there was a partial opening on the back of my shirt..again mid drift was not showing but was told shirt was not allowed .< /Text>

Price is a little expensive especially if you want to just build muscle.  Not many free weights and it can be crowded, but overall it's nice and clean and the staff are helpful.<//text>

My daughter has been doing gymnastics here and it is absolutely horrendous! They do not offer makeups, cancel classes without notice. The instructors and front desk do not communicate at all. Every time I am there , I get 5 difference information about one course/class/. And when you call , you are on hold on average of 15minutes.

Very Disappointing. The amount of money they ask for service is not justified.</Text>

<review>Worst location I asked for a swim refund about two weeks prior to swim classes and I called to check the status of my refund and I have different people telling me about my refund process about me having to take my kids back to fill up the same refund and that I will received my refund which has been expedited. this location has wasted my time just trying to get a refund for classes my son will not be attending at this location</review></record>

I only gave it 1 star because that's the only way I could give my opinion.
I personally go to another location, but my daughter loves the pool slides here. I thought it was ok but noticed every time I came here something bad would happen. THIEF IS A BIG PROBLEM HERE. And the staff is a joke. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE WHO VALUES FAMILY VALUES. I saw a teenager out front waiting to get into the pool area playing with a butterfly knife ( which is illegal ) showing a kid who looked about nine how to open and close the knife and the joke is staff was there and said nothing. I'll never go back to this trash dumpster place ever again. ZERO STARS< /Text>

Customer service is just a joke. The workout area was okay before remodeling. After they remodeled it, they turned it into garbage. Has a pool, but for no use because it is always reserved for their programs.<//Text>

It was our first time swimming here and I let the girl who checked us in know that. However, she never informed me that there were timed sessions and everyone must exit and pay again to re-enter.
My kids live in Santee but I live in San Diego so I had to pay non resident price of $16 for the 2 of them (otherwise it should have been $3 each).... 45 minutes after being there, (at about 1:10pm) they find a turd in the children's pool. The whole staff comes running out screaming "the pool is closed" so everyone starts leaving. They said the pool would re-open at 2pm and that we needed to exit and wait in line to get back in and pay ANOTHER $16!!!!
Needless to say we won't be returning to the YMCA<//review><name>Frank Antonelli< /name><Gmap_id>0x80d95a3e9011f43b:0xd2f4d4f55e4bab1d</Gmap_id><response>{'time': 1499793794831, 'text': "Hi Frank, we’re so sorry to hear your pool time was cut short! We understand how frustrating this can be especially when you are entertaining your children and trying to beat the heat. As you can imagine, the YMCA follows very strict health and safety standards and we have to close the pool when there is a fecal accident. When this occurs, our lifeguards and member services staff hand out guest passes to our community participants for them to return on a different day to participate in an open swim session. It sounds like we missed you! Feel free to contact Susan Alvarez at 619-449-9622 and she’d be happy to make arrangements to secure a guest pass. Our pool is in popular demand during the summer months so we have four sessions offered Monday-Saturday and three sessions available on Sundays. Our goal is to accommodate as many people as possible during the hot summer months. Please visit our website to see our pool schedule: http://www.ymca.org/eastcounty. We hope you'll give us another try :)."}< /response>< Rating>

{'time': 1518653101232, 'text': "Hi Joe, thanks for your review. As you know, the Cameron Family YMCA/ City of Santee Aquatics Center is currently closed due to maintenance and upgrades. We recognize this is inconvenient for many of our members and the community-at-large. However, the proactive measures we’re taking are vital to not only better your member experience, but also for safety. We're pretty confident this overhaul will put an end to those ongoing issues you reference :). Thank you for your continued patience! If you have additional questions, we’ll do our best to answer them."}<//resp>

We hired this company when shelter in place started. Our office is in Palo Alto and their patrol officer checks on our office 4 times a day. He is doing great job and we feel assured while we are all irking from home and the office is closed. Very happy with them.</text>

I live in apartment complex that is patrolled by these guys.
Their guard is very respectful and no matter what time of a night I see the guard walking around with his flash light and greets me. I highly recommend them.</Review>

I have been working for Orion since 2005. I have always been treated fairly and with respect. This is a family owned business and the owner has always been responsive and respectful in the time I asked to speak to him. If you are looking for security job this is the place you want to work.</Review>

<Name>Laura Tafoya< /Name><Text>I am a current employee here. I would like to share my experience at this company. It saddens me that so many bad comments have been submitted for Orion Security. I was shocked as I was reading through. In the time I have been working here Yosh G. the owner, has been nothing but kind and considerate. He sat me down the first week of employment and told me that he values his employees and wants everyone's work to be fairly compensated. Yosh told me he used to be an officer making 4$ an hour and built this company from the ground. Many of the core staff has been here for 10-25+ years. This is a sign, as an employee, that I had entered in a healthy supportive work space. I am absolutely satisfied here as an employee and wanted to share.<//Text>< pics>

Really unprofessional company. I wouldn't recommend hiring these people. Not the workers fault but everyone in office. Lady at desk is one of the rudest persons i have ever met. Ofcourse she's fake when she talks to clients but in reality stuck up and obnoxious too people. There are much better companies around.<//review>

I have read so many reviews on this about the security guards from this company. However, having a family member who works for them and being in a position myself as a supervisor within a company, I feel that if the guards are not doing what they're supposed to be doing it is the fault as the company as a whole (the higher ups and the management). Especially the management. From what my family member has had to deal with, they contract their gaurds out. They give instructions on guards duties that do not coincide with the instructions given at the site they work at. The office staff is HORRIBLE with communication and horrible with consistency, lack simple professionalism.

There is an older man who is in a manager position who does not know how to communicate, is rude, unprofessional, and thinks that it's okay to yell at his "employees" when they feel the employee isn't doing the job correctly, or how he would like -- not caring about what the actual site asks of their guards. Then there is a woman who works in the same office who is African American who is also rude and ghetto and loud. She talks down to the officers and tries to be in power of them all. I have education that supersedes them put together and I am in a position of power, and I have NEVER spoken to any of my employees in the way these people do. Not saying that there aren't also employees who don't do their jobs correctly or have issues of their own, however, the staff that hires them should see that. The people working as hiring managers only focus on commission and looking to get paid, they hire whoever has whatever low expectations that are being asked for and as long as they're not getting complaints they don't care what they do.
However, another essential piece of making a company run smoothly, includes picking the correct staff, being respectful, communicative, and a problem solver. These people belittle their employees that are actually good workers and don't like when the employee is well liked at the site. They instruct their employees to not "communicate directly with clients" when the clients obviously like the employee and treat them as a member of their own team even they are an outside vendor.

I am so disgusted with this company and will ensure that I find out who the higher ups are to have a quick chat about the type of management is here being the face of their company and that trickles down the totem pole in the employees that are hired and contracted out to work with other companies. Good workers are being over looked and abused verbally -- this is why there is such a high rate of turn around. If you don't respect and treat your employees with dignity then they will leave. But if the management themselves are horrible then it doesn't make a difference for them because they will replace that good worker with one less inapt and the vicious cycle will continue.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I am in total shock, why did we hire you, office staff is not able, or available to address multiple establish issues, while working, not able to provide accurate information, spoken with clients, and the community members the they serve, all unhappy, me as well, I love the services, but I am disappointed with detailed record keeping,  and willingness to provide accurate information, Guards are pleasant when they come, some time no shows, at least give us notification, and what would be the reason to withhold this information, we still are obligated to pay, soon as our contract expires, we are moving on, Guards you guys are great<//Review>

Very good service, I think that just like there is good and bad in the world, there will be good clients as well as bad or unreasonable. In business some bad reviews are inevitable. All the people that I know that have used Orion Security are very happy with them... keep up the good work!<//review>

I packed my car at safe parking spot. There was no sign of sign of saying "no parking" and it wasn't a red zone but my car got toaded for no reasons. I had called the company for help but this company would put me on hold for 30 minutes. I hung up and tried calling 3 times but they kept hanging up. I would not recommend this company for help for their low customer service.<//text>

I was told by their staff that I have been hired on the same day when I applied there. And told to come tomorrow for training. Then i was called next day and told that there is an electricity outage so "we need as less people in the office". Anyway I emailed the dispatcher the following day and she told me we'll let you know next week. Which they never did extremely unprofessional and not keeping their words.<//text>

<review>Ordered rare steak/well-done flank/tendon pho and rare steak/well-done flank pho and milk tea boba. Phos had way more noodles than the meat. Steak was cut into small pieces. The condiments were mixed with the mint, lime and sprouts in a plastic. Not looking so sanitary at all. No chopsticks provided. Uncovered disposable spoons were just tossed inside the plastic bag. Boba was too sweet even if instruction left is to use no sugar at all. Not sure if they can adjust sweetness at least make it clear in Doordash app/website that they don't have sweetness levels. Bobas were difficult to suck in because they're all sticking together. Not a good first order in this restaurant. :(</review>< pics>

<text>The place is in a shopping center, on 8th St. Though, it may be easy to miss. It's not necessarily marketed all in your face. From the outside, it appeared to be this hole in the wall, amongst a various Filipino businesses. Nevertheless, the place was bigger than I thought. I got the No. 1. The broth wasn't bad, just seemed a little heavier than most. And the price isn't bad too. For the price of a small, you get what others may call a large.  And I typically ask for extra tripe, but I didn't can that much extra. Oh, and the people were cool too.<//text>< pics>

Their pho broth is pho-REAL LOL! The taste is unlike any other and yes I’m saying that because I’ve been coming to this place for over 20 years! Their peanut sauce for their spring rolls is also the best tasting! I highly recommend any pho (sometimes I like to change it up from beef to the chicken pho or the seafood pho) and also the charbroiled chicken or charbroiled pork dishes with rice! This place is family owned and is definitely a National City gem!<//Text>

Good place for a good serving of Vietnamese food. Big and roomy dining space without the elbow to elbow feel. Good food and size of portions. Friendly staff.<//text>

Pretty good pho, not the best, but good, decent price. Better than a lot of other places. Spring rolls are not very good tho, cardboard-ish.</Text>

The food is pretty good, but, I got it for to go, and I got only one bag of Chop Suey, also, the Phó has large amounts of oil in them. But, overall, the food is good, just lower down the oil please !< /Text>

Best Chicken Pho in town until they switched to that dry white meat chicken. They used to use dark meat chicken which gave it flavor. Now it's just bland af. Spicey fish is still on point but I wish they'd bring the original chicken pho back!<//Review>

Went here for a wheel alignment because I was referred by America's Tire. They were fast and easy.  Their office is clean. And they have a nice waiting room with drinks and TV for while you wait.  They let me know what else was wrong with my car without trying to upset me. Great friendly service. Reasonably priced.</text>

Not to mention I was running late to an important meeting. Well thank goodness for Mark and his excellent customer service.  He was kind, supportive and very informative. He had my car assessed and in no time it was repaired; and just like that I was back on the road. Thank you Mark!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
When I came in to ask about having an oil change, the guy told me it would be hours before it would be done because I called 15 minutes instead of his expectation of 30 minutes before coming in. The guy repeatedly reminded me that someone else would probably come in a couple minutes after me to have the same service done as if to reiterate that my business was not important. Don’t waste your time with this place. They don’t schedule appointments so it’s pure luck and favorites on when you will get your car done. The guy in line ahead of me was having several issues looked at yet was still promised to have everything done hours before when they could do my oil change.<//Review>

< Review>
I came across One Way after having issues with my car stalling and not starting. Marco (the owner) was more than courteous, helpful and knowledgeable! He and his mechanics helped me after business hours and were even kind enough to lend me a rental car. I've had some pretty bad experiences with shiesty mechanics in the past, but you can trust that One Way is honest, has integrity and will do the right thing. I would definitely recommend them!!!< /Review>

I was recommended to this auto shop by a close friend. As soon as I called in a day before I knew this was going to be my place for service! The personnel was extremely professional and they really cut to the chase. Workers are honest and it appears they they just want to help you by providing great service!! I would highly recommend this auto shop to everybody! I will definitely be coming back!</Text>

<Text>Mark is always so helpful and kind. This place treats you like family. The whole staff refers you to your first name. They never try to “up-sell.” I have been going to this place for 10 years and have brought in numerous vehicles for my family and I.

Very honest mechanics who give you outstanding service for a very competitive price. Marco is an caring mechanic that works with his customers. I highly recommend them.

I came in as a first time customer to get my headlights checked out since they’re really dim.  Marc was very friendly and helpful from the beginning. They checked the brightness and did what they can to resolve the issue. I truly appreciated his honesty and excellent customer service. I will definitely be back for all of my maintenance.</Text>

This is an excellent and trustworthy place.

Every one here was friendly and knowledgeable.

America's tire referred me to this place for alignment and it was a great experience.

Not only were they quick and efficient, they had the most competitive price and a comfortable lounge with drinks.

I didn't even have time to finish my Pepsi before they were done.

10/10 would recommend.< /Text>

I was referred to one way auto 🚘 to get an alignment after buying new tires. They were going to do the alignment and they told me I need new struts they took the time to explain to me why and showed me why. They also let me drop my car off and gave me a car to drive to work the next day than after work I went back and my car was fixed. Very nice people who run the shop, they even washed my car for me. It's noce to know we still have places around that we can trust.
Thank you

My usual oil change/maintenance place hasn't been available so I had to go through the stressful process of finding a new, reliable shop to go to. One Way Auto was a wonderful sigh of a relief.
I emailed them to schedule a a specific to take my car in after work, and Mark got back to me confirming the appt time. Convenient? Definitely.
I arrive and the owner Mark, who's been in the business for 30 years, is there at the service desk. I tell him I need an oil change and maintenance check, he reassures me they're able to do it right then and there. I mentioned I also needed my tires rotated, so he told me how much they would be all together and it was reasonable. The waiting room had plenty of comfy seats, coffee and tv. It was socially distanced and overall clean. I'm definitely going to come back for the next maintenance check.< /text>

<review>This place is my go to mechanic! They are always so nice and they are very honest. No matter what they always take me in and can return my car in a timely manner. If you need a mechanic you can trust...definitely make your way over to Mark and Marco!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Everyone here was so kind and helpful throughout my visit! The waiting room was very nice, and I was given water and coffee and even offered food as I waited. They maintained good communication with what they were doing, and brought me out to the car to show me exactly what needed to be fixed so I could see it for myself. Overall, a great experience at One Way Auto Repair!<//Review><resp>{'time': 1604527994326, 'text': 'tank you for visiting our shop thank you for trusting us with your car and your business and we hope to see you again, and are glad that you enjoyed your visit at our shop.'}<//resp>< pictures>

One Way Auto has a new long term customer. From the first encounter on the phone to the office staff to the management, all were genuinely friendly, helpful, professional and personable. The waiting area was very comfortable with a big screen TV, comfortable chairs, great coffee and bottled/canned drinks.
Thank you for great service.</Text>

3 stars they over filled my oil level. Not happy. Thought it was the place to go based on the reviews. I just went in for an oil change. They were kind enough to let me use my own oil and filter. Cost was fair.
They did not check my tire pressure. And over filled the oil level as well as keep the extra oil i had brought in.</Text>

<review>We were on a long drive, hours away from our destination, hours away from home. Our car lost power steering and some maintenance lights turned on. We stopped, and after it wouldn't start we had it towed to this repair shop.

Mark was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. He spoke with Marco (shop owner) who was kind enough to stay late and get the job done (alternator and belt replacement) so we could get home that night.

All around a very professional, friendly, and helpful group of individuals. Highly recommend.< /review><Time>1601511337856< /Time>< pics>

I was referred to One Way Auto from American Tires for an alignment. I called in the morning and got in the same day. I also mentioned that I need back brake pads and they showed me that my right rotor was rippled and bad. So I also had my back rotors and brake pads replaced. Cost was reasonable. They also had a loaner car for me to use for the day so I didn't have to hang around waiting for my car to be serviced. Very friendly and clean place too! I will definitely come back and will refer my friends and family!<//Text>

I have been gong to One Way Auto for a few years and they always do top-notch work in a timely manner.  Mark is so friendly and the owner Marcos is right there working under the hood of the car. And the place is so clean! You could eat off the floor. I love that.  They are honest and trustworthy which is a valuable asset in today's business world.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>One Way Auto is a business worth giving your dollar too. The location of the business is conveniently located in beautiful Downtown Anaheim near lots of restraints, business, and attractions. The environment of the shop is very clean and comfortable; there’s plenty of seating, coffee and other refreshments while you wait. I love recycling my bucks into real wholesome family owned businesses. And this is definitely one of them. Customer service is quick and reliable. Marco the owner takes pride in his shop and you can feel it in the details. The shop is open 6 days of week and Marco is extremely flexible with helping as much as he can after hours. As a female it’s easy for men to try and intimidate me into paying more for a car service. But in the 10 years I’ve been getting my car serviced by Marco he’s always been honest and reliable. I leave the lot satisfied and happy every time. One Way Auto is my go to mechanic shop!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<review>Came in to get an alignment and also needed an oil change. I was greeted right away by the owner, Marco. He was very welcoming and sent me to speak with Mark to further assist me. Their waiting room is huge, very clean, and they offer refreshments. The wait wasn’t at all what I anticipated. Their quality in service is outstanding. The environment is very welcoming and very professional. I recommend to anyone looking for quality work and an honest mechanic to stop by and see Marco.<//review></record>

<Review>I would always take my Genesis to be serviced at the dealership but I heard about this shop from word of mouth. I’m so happy I found these guys. They take great care of your car, they’ve got fair prices and are very professional. I live in Santa Ana but I don’t mind making the drive over just because I know I’ll get great service. I highly recommend you to make this your auto shop.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Always a pleasure getting my oil change here at one way auto, it’s truly the best oil change experience. With TV refreshments and nice attendance while I wait for my car to be done.  Claudia who is secretary 👩‍💼 office assistant is very nice and welcoming. Mark and Marco are truly honest professional letting me know what’s wrong with my car or if any other things are needed. Not to mention the best oil one can buy from is here. I’ll be bringing my car here for life. Thanks to One Way Auto they won my loyalty over.</review>

I came to get a regular oil change.  Initially he told me it would take an hour but was ready in much less time.  Staff is super friendly and professional.</Text>

My car has never had that light turn on so I go down to one way auto ASAP, I let them know I have work soon and I only have 1 hour max to try and fix my car, everyone here is always super helpful and prices are reasonable. The Owner let me borrow a car so I could get to work, then I picked up my car when it was done right when I got off work.
I went from being super stressed to super happy with the way they helped me. I would highly recommend anyone go here!!< /Review>< GmapID>

I was recommended this place for an alignment by America’s Tire. I called first and they said it would be $70 for an alignment and $10 for a rotation. I decided to come out and am happy I did. Really comfortable waiting room and the customer service is great. Really honest guys that work here. Marco the owner showed me what needed work on my car, did the alignment, and didn’t pressure me to get more work done today. He told me the order of the priorities of what to fix next on my car to keep her in good shape. Really appreciate the work done here and highly recommend.</Review>

One Way Auto replaced my worn front hoses and calipers, that needed to be changed when I came in for a wheel alignment. Items my previous mechanic missed when he installed new brakes, rack and pinion.  I trust Marco and his crew to point out maintenance I need now, rather than waiting until it breaks down. I'll be back! I highly recommend this place.<//Review><response>None</response>< Rating>

Wow. This pandemic has been a real inconvenience and as if things couldn't get worse my brakes gave out on me. I found this shop on Yelp it had great reviews and one thing I noticed from the reviews was the over emphasis that this shop is honest and reliable I decided to give it a shot since it's up the street from my house. First of all the location was convenient to find and parking was a breeze. Upon walking into the shop I noticed that it was spotless this is important to me because I live with my elderly parents and I want to avoid contaminating them with any unnecessary germs from outside. To make a long story short I got my brakes fixed and my oil changed it was affordable reliable and my car is running great! I feel safe driving my vehicle. If you're stressed about getting your car serviced come to One Way Auto relieve those nerves. I'm happy I found this shop I'll continue to come here they were clean, sanitary, and efficient! Thank you Marco for being an awesome essential business during this time! Support small business's!<//Text>

<review>I love this place ! Long story short , I took my car in because of a strange creaking noise on my back left tire . I first went to America’s tires and then they referred me to this place . So I went on a Saturday morning and my first impression was really good . The customer service was great and the waiting room was; spacious, comfortable , clean , neat , and had a nice tv with free coffee and donuts and drinks . They fixed my suspension and it took about 6 hours , so they allowed me to use one of their rental cars to drive home instead of waiting ... which was super nice of them . By the end , my car felt better when I drove it home but still has that noise . I took it back twice and they apologized , provided free service , and even ordered a part and installed it for free . While waiting for the part , the owner of the company and I were talking . And right away I could tell , he is a honest and friendly man who really does want to help out each customer as much as he can . I would take your car into this business if I were you . Most car places will rip you off and take advantage of you , but this company is honest and friendly towards everyone . 😀you won’t regret your visit here !</review>< Pics>

< Review>
It's challenging searching for a great mechanic shop. I have to say my car is now, in great hands with One Way Auto Repair and so are the customers. The professionalism is A1. I will try to keep this brief as possible. Let me start with the cleanliness of the office, customer service, good price, waiting period, and great job servicing my car(replacing my oil pan). And I know the price was fair. I had called Dealership and other mechanic shops. After, One Way gave me an estimate, it was a relief! And they are very thorough. I feel so relieved that now, I have a shop that I can trust with my car. ONE WAY IS A ONE! #newcustomer< /Review>

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the business and the people working there. For starters, they have excellent customer service, they are reasonably priced. The best part is they are honest, which is something most mechanics lack there of. Sadly some have less than of reputation; but not here at One Way Auto. Decided to take my car to get fixed and thought to myself let me try this place if it's not good I'll just never come back. I then needed service again and went back, I thought if the price isn't right I'll just won't come back. Well I kept coming back now for four years. You can't beat the price and customer service. They simply Care!</review>

Best place to go! I work a 9-5 job and they will still take you after hours. Marco is super professional and super helpful. The office is the waiting area and it’s nice with tv, ac, coffee/water/soda you name it. That definitely made my experience a lot more pleasant compared to other auto shops. I will 100% come back with my car and would recommend them to anyone looking for a local auto shop to take care of your car:)< /review>

Was recommended here by the place where I got my tires done and was surprised that they were able to get me in right away with out having to wait a long period of time. The staff was very friendly and helpful not to mention very reasonable pricing. Would definitely recommend coming here and will come back for future work if my car was to need any.</review>

I met Mark at the service office. Great guy. He is retired but he keeps his Hospitality traits with One Way Auto Repair. Fair pricing, thorough with thier inspections, and a 360 service one stop shop. The owner, Marco, say hi to him; YOU wont be disappointed.<//Review>

I was referred here after getting a couple of new tires because my lugnut broke off from being tightened too hard. These guys were very welcoming, walked me through every step and even let my daughter watch cartoons in the waiting room. Their level of professionalism and customer service was fantastic. I will absolutely be coming back if anything happens to my car again. Thank you so much for making my situation painless!</review>

A good mechanic is harder to find than a good pair of shoes. I came in this morning after a dire warning about my brakes. The gentleman in the front office was kind, friendly, and took a few extra minutes to explain what was going on with my car. They also, offered me tacos at lunch time! Overall, the service was excellent and relatively quick and the staff was exceedingly friendly and professional.< /Text>

<date>1579394284996< /date><Review>They give great service here, and I will continue to give them my business. Mark is very transparent with what is going on with your car. However I do wish there was just a little more transparency in communication. Give better expectations about turnaround time. I dropped my car off on a Thursday afternoon, and they said it should be ready by Friday morning. I call them Friday morning, and it turned into Friday afternoon, which turned into Saturday morning, which turned into Saturday afternoon. I had to keep changing around my plans due to the turnaround continuing to change. Had they been more up front from the beginning, I wouldn't have had to call in sick for work on Friday. Like I said before, it's great service and I will be coming back. I trust them with my car,  I just wish they were more clear on the turnaround is all.<//Review><username>David Morin< /username>< response>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Marc and his team were extremely professional, accommodating and worked quickly to get my car fixed. I came into OneWay to get an alignment after getting new tires put on at another shop. (Right before Christmas I might add!) They discovered my front end suspension was damaged and immediately, Marc was helping with my insurance company, calling to find parts and organized a rental. After a few days, my car was fixed, clean and drove smoothly. I am so pleased with this shop and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for fast, quality repair for their vehicle. Thank you again.< /text>< Pictures>

I was referred to One Way Auto Repair by the manager of the shop, where I had my tires replaced for a free alignment. Though it was a bit of drive, the trip was worth it. I was greeted warmly and treated professionally. An alignment was needed, so I had the service done.  I didn't have to wait long, and the service technician brought a couple of items to my attention without trying to sell me on fixing them, which I appreciated. The cost was comparable to advertised prices I'd seen advertised elsewhere.< /Text>

I've made One Way Auto my preferred mechanic shop for a reason.  They have always taken care of me, explained every situation that has come up, shown me what's been going on with my car, laid out the options in front of me, and have always given top quality repairs with an emphasis on getting me back on the road with as little delay as possible.

Marco and Mark are top notch people, as are everyone at that shop in the front and the back.

My friends, my family, my coworkers, I tell everyone who needs work done... "Go to One Way Auto.  They'll take care of you."< /text>

<Review>We had previously been having issues with our car( ‘05 Mustang GT) for over a year. After having taken the car to several different mechanics and never having the issue resolved. I was relieved to finally have the issue taken care of by Marco (mechanic) and Mark (service provider). The issue we were having had to do with the transmission support. The service here is great and totally genuine. Both Marco and Mark didn't make me feel like they were being dishonest and seemed to be concerned with our problem. We completely recommend One Way Auto Repair and Services to any one. So much so that we’ve already asked them to work another one of our vehicles.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcd60b8d090783:0xf68bddb3a0e555a8< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Hands down the best shop there in OC! Took my car here a few weeks ago for a misfire and I was in and out within a few hours. The diagnostics itself is $90 but whatever the issue may be, those $90 go into the service. They were able to quote me the best price than any other shop I called prior to them. The reviews don’t lie when it comes to their expertise, prices, and service. With this I found my new shop to go to.< /Text>< rate>

<review>Update took both of our vehicles in the last 2 weeks and as always Marco and his team do great work. Will continue to use One Way Auto for our auto service needs.
I have been using One Way Auto for 8 year's or so and they are one of the most honest auto shops I have ever dealt with. I enjoy working with Marco because he always shows me what is wrong and shows me the parts that he replaces. My wife also feels comfortable going there on her own if she needs to because she knows they will not cheat or lie to her about what her car needs.</review>< user_name>

My experience? In a word ...  “extraordinary.”  As a single female, I am always apprehensive about taking my car in for a diagnostic or for services. Yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was greeted by Mark, welcomed by Marco Lopez, and treated with such respect. Marco patiently analyzed my auto issues and explained in detail my needs. He quoted me an extremely fair price .... and completed the repairs in less than an hour. WOW!! Quality, expertise, and “honesty” should be their mantra. I am one happy girl, who plans to make this my destination location for my auto repairs!  Thank you “One-Way” - your way is the only way! Fair and sincere!</Review>

I gave One Way a call after a referral from America’s Tire since they do not perform alignments.  Luckily, wait on a Friday!  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Got my truck on a lift in minutes, and cheaper than the dealership!

Also, my dealer recommended replacing lowerball joints but it was found to be in working order at One Way (saved me $968).</text>

This is my 2nd time that I took my car here. If you're looking for someone that is trustworthy Marco is the man! He's an honest person and will explain to you what needs to be done. I definitely will and highly recommend One Auto shop in Anaheim! Its the cleanest shop I ever seen and friendly staff that you will ever meet!
Thank you Marco!  You're the best! 😊</Review>

Made a phone call on my way here and as soon as I got here I was taken care of right away! Within 10-15 minutes I was given a quote and was explained to why I needed to change my brakes and roters! Very reasonable pricing and great customer service! The waiting room is very clean and comfortable! HIGHLY RECOMMEND to get service done here! Only took an hour and a half to do brakes and roters!<//text>

<Text>Be careful of this place. Lots of hidden fees. They don't honor the price that you've agreed on. Specially if you use credit card for payment, don't ever go to One Way Auto Repair. They will charge you additional 4%. There are so many auto shops to go without credit card fees. Save your money guys. Don't be fool by this auto shop.</Text>< pics>

I had my car's (09 Malibu) oil changed at One Way today on a recommendation from my daughter and I'm happy to report this place is the real deal.  Mark and the mechanic, Alfredo were professional, knowledgeable, and kind.  Mark had me go out to the garage so Alfredo could explain and show me what other things are going on with my car, which for me was educational.  I appreciate that they took the extra time with my car.  I'm definitely going to be a return customer.  Thank you One Way Auto.</review>

<Text>I was referred to "One Way Auto Repair" by America Tire Discount. Brought my car in for a wheel alignment. The owner Marco explained how he was going to align car also explained the process. I instantly felt that he was being straight forward with his explanation. Extremely satisfied with his helpfulness and honesty. I would highly recommend this auto shop to anyone that is looking for solid work for a reasonable price! Shop was extremely clean and organized as well AAA++++!!!

One of the cleanest shops I’ve ever seen. Very friendly, honest staff. Car was making a clicking/scraping sound, turned out to be a worn caliper. Had a caliper, rotor, and brake pad replacement on two wheels. Sound went away, everything seems to be working now!< /review>

<Review>Marco and his team did good work for me. A small electrical repair and new brake pads. A fair price. The shop is clean, with a comfortable waiting area.  He was happy to answer my questions and explain the work. He also offered the use of a loaner car. My first visit, and I was satisfied.<//Review>< date>

Mark & Marco are friendly, and very knowledgeable. Within five minutes of raising my car, my problem was identified. They explained the repair, and the parts required. I asked if they could do an additional repair, that I had put off, and he agreed without hesitation.
The repair was completed in a very timely manner,  and very well priced, for the quality of work performed.
I believe I've found my "go to" shop, and will definitely recommend to my family and friends!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Not to mention, waiting for your car here is great. Staff was really nice, and they have accommodations.

I've paid to have work done here, as well as just asked opinions. Each person I've spoken to here has been very polite and usually greets with a smile. They don't blow smoke to try and confuse you and diagnose improperly to make more money.

Honest service earns repeat service and referring of friends. I would definitely recommend you go here, and allow them to prove what I've said.< /Review>< Pics>

Found the best mechanic shop in town! Very helpful out of 5 shops I went to and no one could find the problem. Until I came to ONE WAY AUTO REPAIR!  Very good customer service and very understand when it comes to your vehicle! Having my transmission & clutch done and getting into my car put a big smile on my face on how smooth and quiet my car drove! THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE WAY AUTO.. !! I recommend everyone to come get there car fix or oil changes there. Never will I go to Jiffy lube again. 😁😁< /Text>

I had been hesitating to get 2007 Toyota Solara convertible serviced because of prior questionable experiences. I had all four tires replaced at America's Tire on Tuesday and mentioned that I knew I needed them aligned. The service tech gave me Marco A. Lopez's card. I checked Yelp, gave them a call, and was told I could come in any time and just let them know when I was 15 minutes away.  Yesterday I arrived and mentioned a couple other things I wanted done or checked. I also asked if they could take care of where the front passenger panel was hanging a bit. I was out the door in under three hours and had all four tires aligned, front brakes replaced, oil change, upper right mount replaced and throttle body serviced...at one point the owner and two-three employees were working on my car. Throughout the whole process there was communication. The owner Marco even fixed up the loose panel for free and tightened up the one on the driver side for good measure! I left smiling and I am so happy with how well my car is driving now. I will be coming back!< /text>

These guys are great! they replaced the stud and did an alignment while I waited. The price was better than right, the place is clean and for sure I will be going back for service.

Living in Anaheim and I need to go to LA everyday! They fixed my car in no time, even though it seemed like a hopeless case. He offered me one of his cars to drive until mine gets fixed. 5 star service and professional work. Would definitely recommend this place.< /text>

<name>John<//name><Text>A good friend of mine recommended this auto shop to me last year and I've taken my BMW 528i here 2 times since I heard about it. Before that, I had ALWAYS taken my car to an authorized BMW dealership to get all repairs & maintenance done (covered by warranty, but once it runs out, it's expensive), but the past couple of times I had taken my car to the dealership, I received very bad service, and little to no answers/solutions to a lighting/headlight/electrical issue I was experiencing with my car. To add to that, my car's warranty for electrical issues had just expired, and I did not want to pay the ridiculous prices at BMW.

Then last year, I took my car here and received great service - not only for my car but great customer service from the guys working there. Marco was the guy who serviced/performed the maintenance on my car and fixed the electrical issue I was having (and the one that BMW couldn't figure out). Not only was he very professional and nice, but he was also knowledgeable about all things car-related. Most recently, I took my car in for it's 50k mile service and Marco did the job perfectly. Not only that, but he also threw in a free oil change. I completely did not expect that, but it was very generous of him to include that along with the service.

I'd like to personally thank Marco for doing such a great job every time and I would highly recommend anyone to bring their car here for services/maintenance to avoid paying high dealership costs. Marco is knowledgeable and can work on almost any car!</Text></record>

<Review>I've had One Way perform alignments on two vehicles. Both times they were able to squeeze me in and complete the jobs in under an hour. Cars both drive straight and true. I usually do my own under the hood the work, but if had something more complicated i'd for sure bring it to them.</Review><Response>None</Response>< time>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>This shop is a joke. I went in for a misfire on a 2015 focus st and they over charged for replacement parts and labor they didn’t even check the spark plugs they just assumed they were fine. After the new coil packs were added they did a “test drive” and said it was all good. After 10 minutes of driving the car the misfire was back so they didn’t do much of a test drive. This place over charged and didn’t even fix the problem just temporarily made it reside.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcd60b8d090783:0xf68bddb3a0e555a8< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Went here needing my truck fixed due to it turning off cause of a gas rich problem their mechanics told me i needed a "new engine " and it would cost me over "$$$3000"  appearntly my truck wasnt turning on at all anymore(assuming it was the distributor due to all the new parts i had changed i had a feeling it wasnt the engine) i took it back home i cudnt figure why it wasnt turning on at all anymore turns out a new part i changed prior to taking it to the shop was changed again have no clue why ....switched it back AGAIN and bam the truck turned on ... Went to our shops truck fleet mechanic and he told me it was the distributor from the start and my engine was fine..EITHER SOMEONE DIDNT DO THERE JOB CORRECTLY OR THEY KNEW EXACTLY WERE DOING........</Review>

<date>1394060931393<//date><rate>1< /rate><Text>Recently I changed all 4 tires on my car and I was recommended by America Tire Co  to do an alignment on my car at a shop called ONE WAY AUTO REPAIR. I drove to the shop and specifically mentioned that I had replaced the front shocks and will need to do the rear also. I asked if I should change my shocks first and then come back to them. They offered to replace my shocks for $320 but I told them that I had already ordered them. They said that there was no need to come back after the rear shocks had been replaced and they will realign them again for free. They charged me $168.52 for the alignment while on the phone they said it was only $60.00. I agreed to pay as long as they were going to redo it for free and absolutely at no cost to me so I do not have to pay twice which they agreed. Less then 3 weeks later I returned with new shocks on rear and to my surprise they refused to do it for free unless I change something in the rear and pay them again. I argued that this was not what we agreed on and the realignment was suppose to be at no cost to me and they still refused to honor their agreement. I told the office that this was cheating and they were being dishonest, but they did not seem to care. I went to American tire shop and spoke with the manager and told him the story and requested not to advertise for this shop.
I am writing this because I believe people should not go to a shop that is dishonest and is cheating people. I have no choice but to tell my friends and relatives who they are dealing with. Customer satisfaction should always come first, especially if customer is right and a disservice has been done.< /Text>< Pics>
