I have previously visited Larry's on previous occasions, and my food had been very good. I also recommended Larry's to a friend. I am now sorry I did. The last food I purchased was not the same as my previous visits. I would think it has a lot to do with the cooks. Some cooks can cook the same exact food, and for some reason the taste changes. I won't be visiting in the future.<//Text>

Food is delicious. My babies loved the food. We ordered the shrimp platter, onion rings, fries, chicken quesadilla with fruit punches. All are delicious 😁</review>

<Text>Stopped for the first time last night because my son definitely wanted a burger.  We could see our food being made through the window and nothing was a disappointment.  My sisters fries were nuclear hot.  My son was in the backseat enjoying his burger (bacon burger no onions or pickles), I mean we heard how good it was with every bite.  When I got home the same thing happened, it was so good (avocado burger with everything).  The staff was friendly at the window and shared they stay open for the families in the area.  The prices are super affordable too!  Looks like we will be coming back, it’s worth the drive from Inglewood.</Text><rate>5< /rate><Date>1605539579738< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Great burgers! Honestly, the best burger place in Pedro. I haven't had most of the Mexican menu options, but the breakfast burritos age really good, the traditional diner food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc.) are great and they have good portion sizes on the sides.<//Review>

Good food with a menu consisting of all day  breakfast, sandwich, burger, and Mexican food fare. But I stick with the burgers. Because hey, it's not called Larry's Mexican food. Good prices. Basically a cashier and 2 short order cooks make up the staff so a couple orders can back things up pretty quick. Everyone is super friendly. Only real gripe is that IF you obey traffic regulations getting in and out of this place sucks.< /Text>

Burgers are good. The service has a huge amount of room for improvement. *if you're on a budget. Prices advertised on menu inside are not the correct.( Prices are way higher) ask for your total before she leaves you there standing like a tree.< /review>

Larrys Hamberger is oneof those authentic fast food places like pitburger  in Gardena and BusyBee in  Pedro that i always stop by when in the area to get a taste of good fresh food. Their burgers and food is fresh, affordable, and healthy. Staff are friendly. And the owner is a calm n nice old guy who is goes above and beyond for his customers<//Review>

<text>The customer service at Larry's Burgers was okay. However, we were really concerned when we notice that the cook had no gloves on when he was preparing the eggs. We also noticed and realized that the person taking our order didn't have a lot of patience with us. My sister is hard of hearing. With that being said, she has a hard time trying to get the person behind the speaker box to understand exactly what it was that she wanted to order. When it came time for me to place my order and for my sister to repeat it back, the lady that was behind the speaker box, was very impatient and was trying to rush us, which made it difficult for me to make a complete order.</text><username>Toni Bible<//username><UserId.>108387769372267857080</UserId.>< Rate>

This is the second time I’ve gotten out of work and have arrived at 10:15pm and again at 10:30pm with the cook and cashier telling me they are now closed. After stressing to them we still have 45min before them being closed. They were rude and did not care. I took pictures of their signs being open and my pictures being time stamped to prove exactly the times I was there. I wish the owner could respond to this message because When we asked to speak to a manager they brushed us off and said there is no manager both nights we tried ordering something. Used to be my favorite place to eat but now they conduct their business is unsatisfactory.< /Text></record>

Larry's burgers has always been good, but it seems lately is become pricey. Our hamburger and zucchini weren't ready at the same time, so our hamburger sat on the counter for another four or five minutes waiting on the zucchini. No under a warmer but on the counter.</review>

The cook does not wear gloves and touches the food with his hands ! Gross wipes hands on towel not washing between food he’s cooked and touched . Left food there did not pay and left never to return . Board of Health needs to re-examine this place and not give A rating . This particular time with COV -19 cook did not wear mask or gloves . Save yourselves avoid place!<//review>

A bit cheaper in price than their competitor just down the street.
They had excellent service and made you feel comfortable. Fast even while busy with their drive thru and dining area.

Amazing amazing food and fast service.
Little shop but big food taste here. Went during lunch rush with my buddy and had a very short time to wait even with only 2 or 3 people working.
If I find myself in San Pedro again I will definitely visit again.< /Text>

<review>Had to drop a star Larrys no longer have PASTRAMI! WHAT KIND OF WORLD ARE WE LIVING IN?

Love this place for burgers and chili fries. I would of done 5 stars but I don't like everything. Onion rings are thin. Not how I like them. I love their thousand island dressing, it's not to over powering like some places I've had and are to sweet or have an odd taste. I love the coke, it has a good flavor and the ice they use go well. The chicken tender plate is alright. Again, I like the burgers, double cheese, avocado and regular cheese burger. Fries are good to. Once in a while you might get a bad order of fries like a lot of ends<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<review>My son Ruben Loves Larry's Burgers! At least 4 days a week he gets their french fries perfectly seasoned with season salt & I get their zucchini, which is also perfectly seasoned and delicious with their ranch dip! Their hamburgers melt in your mouth bur their breakfast burritos are what they are famous for. They are friendly, fast and always make sure they say hi to my son! Great family place and located on the busiest corner of Channel St & Gaffey St. Definite 2 thumbs up!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd361bde6910af:0x50268419613f3d1e< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
Asked them to make the two burgers well done and when I get back to the house, they were literally pink. They're thin patties so not hard to cook to a brown color. I also said seasoning salt on the fries and fhey literally poured the whole bottle on the fries, uneatable.

The two grilled cheeses we're just nasty looking and the guy cooking (wearing the Mexican flag hat) just looks like he has an atittude. He was working right next to the owner and they still had the nerve to throw my food half cooked into the bag.

This place has been around for a long time and maybe it's time to close it down. They can't seem to keep the quality consistent and I just noticed they have a B grade. I've seen dirtier looking places that have a better food grade. All in all, very disappointed and no, I won't be coming back.

Thanks Larry, but no thanks.< /Review>

<Text>When i walked up to order. I was straight ignored . Stood there for 5 mins before I was acknowledged.
Food was nasty . Not sure if they use 100% real cheese . It was disgusting. If my car wasn't being detailed next door , I would have left after the first 3 min of being ignored .
I will not return . Gas station foods better than this place .<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dd361bde6910af:0x50268419613f3d1e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Cook had his phone on the bread rack, playing on his phone cuz it was slow, then with that same hand scooped the avacado out and spread it on my sandwich with those same fingers touching his phone screen. No gloves, no washing hands. Arent phone screens like more dirty than a tolit seat? Plus he looked like the type of dude that would be taking a duce playing with his phone. Plus theres no soap in the restroom so you know that dude dont be washing his hands ever.

Thier hamburger combo is descent. Thier thousand island dressing has no flavor and is watered down to the max. Thier ranch is watered down to the max as well with barley any flavor. Some one from the back of house came out to use the restroom and did not wash his hands. Not going to eat here again.</Text>

Cherish is a top notch bartender.  Really personable and a good worker.  She was talking with a guest next to me about dental surgery she needs.  I would recommend the Clarion and Shooters do everything they can to help her out!!< /Text>

My favorite spot for Bar food. I love going here. Looking forward to returning with my friends. The prices are good for what you get. Food and atmosphere reminds me of Kansas City.< /review>

<Text>The bar usually has a relaxed vibe. I wasn't drinking and a group of 3 women were starting stuff with me, making snarky comments, dancing like they thought they were cute and just threatened by my existence. I didn't look at them wrong, say anything to them, they were just like Cinderella's ugly step sisters. The only issue I've ever had there. I just left.<//Text></record>

This place is awesome! Nice little venue, doesn't get too crazy here. Fridays are the best days to go. The DJ there is on point. Will definitely go back and recomend.  Friday nights there are finesse.</Review>

<Review>The rooms need a little updating, such as, more power outlets  and a newer A/C system.  Other then that there's a lot to like. The bar and restaurant are nice and the inside pool is classical.  The price is right so I'll stay here again in the future.</Review><username>Kenneth Collins<//username><user_id>109080401566157695670</user_id>< pics>

A place where homeless women and children are given a safe place Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday's 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. They hand out clothing (pants, blouses, underwear, gloves, knitted hats, baby formula, diapers, hygiene items, and many other services) and behind Mary House is Loaves and Fishes where lunches are served. Loaves and Fishes also has many, many services. Everyone there at Mary House and at Loaves and Fishes are friendly and helpful.</Text>

I've been to Loaves and Fishes a few times and I think they're great. They do so much for those in need, they provide you with a shower, clean clothes, blankets, wonderful meals, and help with additional needs. Thank you so much, God Bless you. Sincerely Irene Medina</Text>

I don't know what I would do without Mary House. They helped me get my ID.  the staff is always courteous and professional even when I can see they're having a rough day. I love each and every one of them at work there and volunteer their time it's quite the blessing. Iam  never judged on days I haven't been able to do laundry. You can take showers in the morning if you get there early and sign up around 7 a.m. sometimes there's karaoke in the afternoonsometimes it's so nice to hear the women sing so beautifully.I can keep going  on and on about all the wonderful things they offer Women. I am truly blessed to to have found them. Amen<//review>

Its a 'day shelter' where you can sit indoors in the heat/ac, charge your phone, get cool water, or use the bathroom. They have a limited amount of spots for using the showers every weekday, so get there early. They serve breakfast every weekday morning until 9am. You can use this as a mailing address and use their phone or get messages. Once a week you can get toiletries like pads, socks, underwear, shampoob tooth paste and other stuff depending on the donations available. You can also get a small amount of diapers, wipes, baby food and formula. Sometimes they even have clothes and camping gear, but again it depends on the donations available. You can also get stamps, I believe its 1 per week. Quiet places to sit and sleep during the day. Its a small space, but theres a play ground outside for kids, and Mustard Seed school for all grades. Loaves & Fishes next door serves lunch every day of the week 11a-1pm, has mens showers and laundry, and has lockers to store stuff in, as well as hosting sac self help housing starting at 9am during the week.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

You can get a Shower if you line up by 6:30am you will be in and out by 8:00am then at that time eat hot breakfast free upstairs has emergency clothing and toiletries free for the poor and homeless they have many women that come threw beware some of these ppl that use Maryhouse have Mental health issues and are somewhat violent and loud and may hurt someone if you are in the right place but wrong time so be careful not to have confrontations with them it isn't worth the beat down you might get from expressing feelings of the way they can behave</Text>

The things that they do for these women is just unbelievable it's really hard two have any excuse at all as to why you can't change your life any day and it sure doesn't hurt to have clean clothes and hot meals and hot showers and cell phone charging Outlets and all sorts of things that they provide 4 you everyday of the week. They really are angels on the Earth< /text>

Such a blessing to me. There is no other place like this in California or anywhere else in the whole world that I am aware of. The courageous, compassionate and giving women, volunteers and employees have no idea what anyone is truly dealing with on a regular basis. Unless you have or are living the lifestyle of most of these homeless women and children you just never know what is going on in the minds and hearts of each and every person who walk through the doors.  I have a 90% more positive  attitude and outlook on my life today than I did two years ago when I walked thru the lobby feeling broken, discouraged and unsure of the life I was struggling with.  I feel more encouraged about this L&F program who do more than just provide showers, a safety net, a warm temporary day shelter and hygiene kits. The love, smiles, positive mentoring and the gift of friendship and a sense of "belonging or acceptance".
Thank you all for being there for me.
With love... SLK :) <3<//Text>

After having my hair cut once or twice a month for the better part of 50 yrs., by professional barbers, this is the first time I've had someone charge an extra $5, atop the $15 price listed, because they had to "use scissors" (quote, unquote).
Perhaps they don't understand what a barber does? Or perhaps they need to change their name from the "Chop Shop' to what it appears to actually be... the "Clip Joint".
Two thumbs down for pegging my B.S. meter. It's a shame, too. They just lost a potential long term client.</Review>

<Text>I've been visiting Moto United for a couple years now. Mostly for the Yamaha demo days as I've been in the market for a new motorcycle. The closest Yamaha only dealer to me was in Pasadena and I just didn't care for the sales people. Far too aggressive was one & other was condescending. This is why I took my business to moto united. I called and spoke to Luis Vasquez and told him what I was looking for. He called me when his inventory came in but unfortunately it was not the color I was looking for. He very politely encouraged me to come check out a very similar colored bike. I'm glad he did. He made the purchasing experience a breeze. He was also the first person there to listen to my pleads that they get their shop a soda vending machine for their customers! When they get that machine in, I'll change my review to a 5 star. 🤭
Thanks again for being super cool & friendly to me & my friend through the whole experience.<//Text>< Pictures>

I had an excellent experience at Moto United Bellflower. Family and friendly environment. Luis, Pat and the whole staff were absolutely great to me while I was purchasing a new 2021 SSR 125cc. They helped me find the right dirt bike at the best price! Thanks Luis and Moto United, I will be coming back again in the future to do more business. Trust me give them a call, or walk in to see their inventory you won’t be disappointed!< /Text>

<Text>Spectacular experience, very welcoming environment 😎. Professional staff members that know their jobs very well. Luis was a very honest, respectful salesman worthy of the 5 star review 👍. Bought my first bike here 😀. Highly recommended. 🙏 Thank you definitely helped add some regular fun in my life 😁. Grabbed a Yamaha Bolt XVS950 for my first bike 😲<//Text>< pictures>

After visiting couple motorcycle dealership, walked into moto united bellflower. Dealership looked nice, clean and organized. "Andrew" (sales guy) helped me with great price over other motorcycle dealer.  I am very pleased with my purchase. Will definitely come back for future purchases and also props to financing dept. (ken). 👏👏👏< /review>

My boyfriend and I were looking at buying a side by side to use on the property we live on. We inquired about a specific one that was listed online. We spoke with Patrick. He was very honest and easy to work with; which is why we ended up going with Moto United with our purchase. When we arrived, Patrick and Andrew were very welcoming. They made our first time buyer experience very very pleasant! I grew up riding dirt bikes and have thought about getting back into it. Well now when I chose to buy a bike, Moto United and Patrick/Andrew will be the ones I will go to!!</Text>

Service not the best! 1 week wait for service that means leave it, to get recall parts put on, My input is make appointments, date / time and we can bring it in on that date.. in n out, same day service. Less waiting... it's just a suggestion, schedule appointments for customers can come in like they're seeing the doctor. "Cycle Doctor" makes more sense.The parts are in!! I waited for parts to arrive, before I went in..<//Text>

I drove all the way down from Camarillo, 77 miles, and I was not disappointed. Nate, Greg, and the rest of the staff was very accommodating, and made the purchase of my new 2020 Yamaha Tracer GT a breeze. I was in and out in less than one hour, what other dealerships value your time like that. No other dealerships could even come close to matching their price. Excellent customer service, and a killer deal, just can't go wrong. I will be a returning customer for sure.</Text>

Put deposit on my 1st MT-09 SP in Houston in Nov. March delivery was changed to May, then Aug. I found an MT-09 SP ON the floor at moto United in bellflower CA on thurs before mothers' day. Sent my deposit, gave authorization to draft down payment for Moto United Bellflower.  Patrick, my salesman was awesome to work with but his manager was less than impressive. Mgr called me Friday aft to say he sold MT-09 SP 6 days previously but failed to remove from inventory even though bike was on floor on Thurs, 6 days after so-called "sale," After I canceled houston order. Moto United Mgr SUCKED. Said he would talk to yamaha rep to find another. Mgr now doesn't reply to my emails or my calls. Waiting on one in Redondo bch but have deposits on 2 more in CA and UT. Careful when buying from Moto United Bellflower.<//review>

Very happy with the experience here at MotoUnited Bellflower. After a horrible and dishonest experience at another dealer a few days prior, we were able to find the Jet Skis we wanted, along with an amazing experience through sales.

They left a bolt missing from my rear wheel traction control sensor. It could have gone into my brake pads and caused me to crash. At cheapest a 150 dollar part and I only caught it because I did my own inspection as I got it. The work was $200 but due yourself a favor and dont come here if you value your life. After I pointed it out to the service employee he offered a "I'm sorry" and nothing more.<//text>

<text>When your in the store itself, it's great and everything runs smoothly, but trying to get a call through to anyone but sales is more miss then hit. (Lately they have done better with this and I appreciate that, but I'm not going to ignore weeks of trying to get in touch)

As for the actual service, just head in early and hope they have time for you because you can't make an appointment in advance. However, my ride is running smooth and they even cleaned it (my brother had apperently taken it out of the garage to make room for some stuff and never told me so I didn't find out until I went in the back to put it in my friends car. I was so worried that being exposed outside for multiple nights was going to lead to some major issue, but thankfully for my brother's wallet, nothing came up) and it was finished three days sooner then the estimated time which was a real blast. I raced to pick it up and return to the roads from which I came.

TLDR; hard to get a hold of but worth it when you do.<//text><Response>{'time': 1600819391477, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5 Star review!'}</Response>< userid>

<gmap_id>0x80dd32a9e9776c2f:0x1f8333cef241dbc7< /gmap_id><text>They call it an ADM (aka ADP)  fee. (Additional Dealer Markup fee)  It is basically a huge amount of money they do not advertise on the price of the vehicle. When you talk to them they brush over it quickly and hope you don't notice. They push you to come in to the dealer. It is completely unfounded and I personally run from any dealer that charges a markup fee or uses this tactic. I found to get the real price at a place like this you will most likely need to add at least 30 to 50 percent to the price they advertise. The formula I use is the price of the vehicle, plus tax, plus tag plus registration. Everything else should be included. ADM is a very frustrating and predatorial practice. Do not do business with dealers who do this. It is time to change the industry and put these greedy dishonest dealers out of business. Send a message the the dealers and manufacturers that we want the real price. If we pause purchasing, once bikes are sitting on their dealers floors for a few months, they will change quickly. Also look for other fees such as S&H, Shipping, Advertising, Dealer Prep or any uncapped fee.  For more info check out the article "10 fees you should never pay when buying a car" by Jack Sackman.

<Text>After repeated calls and concerns after 3 months and still no title or tags for a fully paid new bike, found out that transfer was submitted by dealer but rejected by DMV.  I've called my sales guy every month waiting and said don't worry, DMV is slow during pandemic. That was bs, mentioned my concern with Nate and no follow up. After a trip to the DMV and mentioning they still don't see it in their system a month after and one hour wait time with DMV on the 3rd month, finally got to the bottom of it. DMV stated something missing in the transfer application. No follow up with dealership even after multiple calls, I'm doing my own investigations.

This is the second bike I bought cash at moto united in the same year. First one from La Habra and no issue there. Will not be buying again at this location Moto United - Bellflower. Time spent calling the DMV when it should be the dealer is insane to go through. Nate was quick for a follow up call about the bike a week after purchase, just not on concerns with title or tags. So if I wanted to sell the bike, can't even do that 3 months after since paperwork from dealer hasn't been completed.

Dropping another 2 stars due to not still having tags or title after 90days. Temp registration is now expired and spoke to a law enforcement friend. It is now illegal to ride the bike and can be impounded if pulled over. Great, what to do since the ball is with the Moto United - Bellflower? If anyone else has this issue, open a case with CA AG for business complaint, if that doesn't work, I guess lawyer up for Breach of Vehicle Sale Contract.

Hopefully no one else runs into this issue. Frustrating when it's beyond your control or business does no follow up or shows concerns.

Update 1-19-2020
120 days after fully purchasing the bike and still no tags or title. At least the owner replied to my Google review stating a paperwork error and they'll look into it. Called DMV a week after the reply and DMV states nothing has changed on their end. Had to get a Vin verification on my own and not sure where to send the paperwork since it needs to be sent to where the original one from the dealership was sent to. What a nightmare!

Last week spoke to Nate who confirmed paper work error and the one who did the paperwork is no longer there. How is this my problem? Get me a solution or at least find a path to make it right. Now have a case with DMV Investigations and contacting Yamaha Motorsports to see if I can get Manufacturer of Origin and submit a whole new submission via 3rd party registration service.<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>This is my full experience with mortal United In the beginning they were friendy and  Willing to help of course the needed to sell.  They sold me a tow insurance  And when I need it my bike to be tow they didn't have a tow truck  I have to get my own insurance to tow my bike  Every time I took my bike for service They took for ever to give it back I had to be on them constantly to get things done  When I had an accident I need a paperwork From them And the manager (liz sage) Gave me the run around for months!  I had to go to the dealership to get my paperwork  When I got there none of them were worrying a mask for my safety in mid pandemic. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PEOPLE AGAIN.<//Review>< Pictures>

Took my time looking for a great deal on a 2018 Yamaha MT 07.  I'm so glad I went with Moto United.  Even though I live in south bay San Diego (Chula Vista), it was absolutely worth buying my bike at this shop.  The salesman, Savith Srey, was phenomenal!  He was extremely helpful, answered all of my questions, and followed up regularly until the deal was done.  To top everything off, not only did I get a better price from Moto United, Savith personally delivered the bike to me at my home as promised, and he did this on his own time!  You can't ask for better customer service than that - talk about going the extra mile!  Savith is perhaps the best salesman I've every dealt with at any motorcycle shop...he will earn repeat business from me for sure!</text>

Walked in about a half hour ago. Got quoted $5600 otd for a dirt bike with an msrp of $3299. Otd price is msrp + 70%?! Was actually laughing as I walked out. Heading east.<//review>

< Review>
I went to Moto United and immediately felt welcomed. I went to a different shop before them and I did not like the service I almost felt like they were ignoring me when I first walked in. At Moto Unites I was greeted by one of their guys Cyrus. The whole time I was there, they answered all my questions and concerns I had about motorcycles. I am a first time rider but I didn’t feel pressured into anything and I felt right at home there. The whole time I waited for my paperwork Cyrus kept a smooth and genuine conversation going with me. I am overall impressed with the customer service and finance department for working with me. I was able to ride out with my 2018 R3! I would definitely recommend Moto United to my friends and family. And I would definitely shop with them again.<//Review>

Are you kidding me over $800 in dealer  extra mark ups. Transportation From Dock to Bellflower $400 ?????
$300 for prep are you kidding I was with Porsche Audi Volkswagen for 20 years we didn’t do that on New Porsches I guess that’s why we were number one Porsche dealer in California the number two in United States<//text>

<Text>My family and me went to MOTO United on Presidents’ Day to look at a Ural they had listed. Just what I was looking for. Cyrus, my sales guy was awesome. Super nice and easy to deal with. We came to an agreement and a few days later I went and picked up my new bike.
About 2 weeks after I went back to have a tune uploaded to the bike and got to meet everybody in the service department. I really like everybody I met there. Really happy to have a great Ural dealer pretty close to me.

I’ll see all you guys again soon. And thanks for taking great care of me< /Text>< Date>

This is the best place to buy anything from watercraft to off-road stuff!! They have the best deals and there customer service is the best. I been going here since 2016 and they always gave me the best service ever. I just bought a 2019 Yamaha raptor from this place! If you ever think of buying a motorcycle,watercraft, or off-road vehicle this is the place to go.</Review>

They took the time to find the lowest apr that I could get and even work with me with the total price in order to fit my budget.

They offer me good deals in my first equipment and service.

I had it towed here (didn't trust other dealers I'd done business with and they were close). Jose has been awesome in not charging me storing fees while allowing the insurance companies to get things sorted out.
Got a new R6 and just brought it for it's first service because of how they were awesome with me in the past. The service was easy and no hassle. I definitely will be coming here in the future for any bike business as they don't seem nearly as slimy as other commercial Yamaha dealers in the area.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been taking my bike since i had 600 miles and recently dropped it off after 8 day 3097 mile ride.  Andrea the service manager helped me get some new tires before my ride and they performed as promised. Andrea totally went above and beyond to make sure my 14,000 mile service and two year fluid flush was all done and let me tell you my bike feels brand new hahaha. They always take that extra step to take cate of their customers. I will ONLY go here for service of my bike.< /Text>

<text>Good service they try to work with you...
But the only thing i didn't  like was the financing lady, she tried to fool me by adding $650 on top of my purchase. It was under as "  Accessories :$650 " so i asked her why was that added ? What accessories am i getting...Her answer was " oh the motorcycles come in crates so we charge to unload them "  accessories mean a helmet gloves etc but to her it was " we charge to unload them... that's already lying to a customer... so becareful< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1553736756153, 'text': 'Hi Martin thank you for leaving us a review.

Not sure how the MSRP price of $11,400 is crossed/lined out, to show a “sale price” of $6,740... but yet it’ll still cost over $11k for the bike. Is this the Dealer version of click-bait?< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>I can’t be more appreciative for the team at Moto United for staying open after hours to keep me happy and get me in the new Rzr! They were all extremely patient, friendly, and kind. Especially Tania! She  greeted us with refreshments and snacks!! The Rzr was spotless and ready to go when we got there and the process was quick and easy. I highly recommend Moto United for anybody looking for a new toy. Great bunch of people, they really treat you like a person and not just a customer. :)</review>< pictures>

The service team is “TOP NITCH”!
Andrea, the service manager, took on the restoration of my 1970 Yamaha Trailmaster and Jose, who is an amazing tech, brought it back to life. They kept me up to date with cost and ETA.
I have found a new shop for my motorcycle repair and service needs.<//Review>

Moto United, Bellflower location is perhaps the best dealership I have ever visited with regards to price, service and options available. CYRUS went above and beyond to get me the deal on the new FZ07. He made sure that I got the bike of my choice (he had to get the bike delivered from a different Moto United location, prep the bike out of crate as the color I preferred was not onsite), test and deliver the same day. These guys are awesome. I also appreciate THOMAS who drove all the way to deliver the bike the same day in the evening (Saturday) so that I could ride the bike the next day (Sunday).

I am pretty sure once I outgrow my current bike, I am heading back to Moto United, Bellflower to get my new ride. I highly recommend Moto United. Thank you folks!!< /Text>

My father and I have been going to this place for years. The Parts/ Accessories department always offers outstanding service whether you purchase in person or online. The Service department has never wrenched on my bikes, but they have done my water craft and that service has always been satisfactory. I myself have never used the Sales department, but my father said Raj is a good guy always willing to work with you and meet you at a median.

We like to support our local businesses first- and to this date, they have never failed us. Thank you for all your hard work and great attitudes; keep it up!< /review>

Thanks to Victor I finally have the bike I've always wanted!  He helped with my financing, going through which option worked best for me and he even financed my gear!

I always wanted an R6 and now I have one!  Thanks again!</text>

I changed my review cause when I bought the Yamaha they said they would give me a good deal on the Yamaha jacket I was qoated 275 to 300 after coming back a month later they wouldn't give me the Jacket it was back up to 500 and no discount  have been shopping around for about 3 months looking for a great deal on 2018 MT 09 ! I have been riding CBR 600 r then the last 5 years on my GSXR 600 and the GSXR from day one had way more pull then my old CBR so I decided to keep my GSXR and transition into a more upright bike but with the power! Anthony did an excellent job keeping in touch with me no pressure sales at Moto United ! Unlike other competiters if u want a great deal you found the place ! I'm a person who gets a little stressed out before a finance purchase these guys did an excellent job all around thank you Moto United thank you Anthony ! I purchased my first bike i ever had it was a GS 500 E from bellflower also my second bike a katana 750 from bellflower Motorsports this is my third purchase and my first Yamaha from the New location Moto United great new show room floor if u haven't been down there it's totally worth checking out if u want a great deal just off the 91 freeway and bellflower I had no idea they were there and they offered some great deals on matching gear ! I now have the best of both worlds !<//review>

Saw a high mileage vmax on cycle trader listed for 5.5k, I was very interested so I called them on Wednesday(2/27) to schedule a test ride on next monday(3/4), I was gonna have a 3-day long weekend from3/9~3/11 and I have schedule already but I cancelled it and switch my day off with my coworkers just for the bike, their receptionist said he've move the bike to the back so no one touches it. On Sunday(3/3) night I texted the receptionist to confirm we're going on Monday, and he was like ok just talk to their general manager when we get there. So we got there on time and the manager didn't seems to know that we're coming, he said the bike was dropped in the back and the receptionist didn't know that, I was like okay so now what? He say he will fix the radiator but not the scratches on the scoop and muffler, and the bike is for sell for $6700, that's over 1k higher than what it's listed and he's not gonna lower the price for the damage. So we talked a little bit about their listed price and he was like okay but not lower than that, seriously?  I mean come on you're trying to sell me the bike for 1k more than it's listed in the first place, the bike was dropped and not rideable and we were not noticed, I had 3 of my friends coming with me they all spent their day off and we were all excited but the radiator was damage and removed we were not even able to do a test ride, and you're telling me you can do the listed price but not lower even you refused to repair all the damage causd by the drop, I have all the money and gears with me and was ready to make it happen, I feel embarassed in front of my frinds as they all went with me and we basically were there for nothing but looking at a broken bike...<//review>

{'time': 1551826868876, 'text': 'Hi, I am sorry you feel this way, and you feel you wasted your time.  We worked with you on Monday and went over the bike. We went over all of the small details and imperfections of the bike that day. There was a small coolant leak that was getting fixed. We had and have nothing to hide.  I had a new part on order and we told you it would be installed. We also went over what we would fix on the bike.  We have the bike  priced for $5500 plus tax ($530.58)  and DMV, Doc fee ($449.50).  Your total price was $6484.83. I explained to you that sale tax and DMV go to the government. I also invited you back to see and test ride the bike once it was complete.  I am sorry we could not come to a agreement on price. Some times we just can not agree on a deal. The goal is always to part as friends, because we know that if we can not come a agreement on a current deal, there could be a second opportunity. We are sorry you did not have the experience you had expected. Our goal at Moto United is to be upfront and honest, and always make it as easy as possible.  At the end of the day we need our customers to be happy. We rely on good customer service, and we treat our customer like family.'}</Response>

<review>Great customer service. They even stayed open an hour past their closing time because I was running late on my ride from Las Vegas. They offered me coffee and water when I arrived and let me have some time to warm up before getting into the paperwork. Bike was a little dirty/dusty and the fuel light was on (a resale bike), but they topped up the tank when I asked them about it and they gave me a run down on the bike's extensive electronic features. All, despite the fact that it was, now, over an hour past their opening hours. Also, the bike's battery went flat after I had, thereafter, had it parked for 5 days, but holding onto charge is apparently a fault of the bike's design - something that's true, that they'd warned me about if I planned on parking it for longer periods. Prices are competitive and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. All in all, it was a very good experience and I would go to them next time I'm looking for a bike.</review>< date>

Just purchased my Suzuki from Doug. Absolutely amazing service. While bike was getting prepped we watched a movie and offered refreshments while we waited. Never been so satisfied in a motorcycle purchase. A dealer in Long Beach lost our business simply because of the lack of service.< /Text>

Took my bike there to have an electrical  problem fixed. They never called to update or inform me of any progress. I had to call at least once a week to know what was going on. After a month, finally got the motorcycle back, only because I called in. I took the bike home, and noticed the check engine light on. I had to bring it back. now that was a new problem they are going to try fix. they took over 30 days to fix a six hour labor problem. very poor customer service.< /review>

My husband and I always wanted to get our kids out to the desert for family fun.  We went into Moto United Bellflower just to look at he cool toys for our kids.  Victor was greater us the first moment we walked in and was super polite.  He walked us through the dealership showing us all the kids units and what would work best for our kids.

We picked the YAMAHA YFZ50 and when Victor walked us through how easy the financing could be... the next thing we knew it... we were driving home with a new toy for the kids.

We will definitely be back for the next toy when the kids get bigger.

If you want a salesman who is honest and easy to talk to... come to Moto United in Bellflower and ask for Victor.  He won't let you down!

Thanks again we'll be back soon for some more toys!< /text>

This place is amazing I like the no pressure sales guy. The transaction was smooth and so was the sale! I was shopping around for my first bike and I didn't like the other places especially del amo motor sports they were going to charge an arm and a leg! But not with these guys, they gave me tips and little advice on how to ride and how to maintain my r3. Loved it ever since I'm about to go get an r6 for me and give my wife the r3. I'm keeping my buissiness with these guys. Highly recommend!<//Review>

<Review>This place was excellent, I had gone to other dealerships where they were rude and tacking on hidden charges that did not add up when we did the math. Victor Kha, the general manager, was amazing with his help. Walked looking for a 2017 GSXR 750, walked out with an new R6 instead and I couldn’t be happier. Victor took hours helping me as I jumped from Suzuki to Yamaha then to colors and finally to model year. Then he went over the multiple payments plans that best worked out for my budget.
I will definitely recommend this to friends and family searching for a new or even used bike, go see Victor Kha.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dd32a9e9776c2f:0x1f8333cef241dbc7</GmapID></record>

I'm so glad I chose Bellflower Motorsports to makeover my 2006 Suzuki Hayabusa. They worked very closely with me, specifically Alfredo, to get everything I wanted. The finished product exceeded all of my expectations. They take pride in the work they do, so they wanted things to be as perfect as I wanted them to be. I get asked ...who did your bike... all the time, and I proudly refer them to you everytime. Thanks to everyone at Bellflower Motorsports, for making my vision for my bike a reality! I'm a fan for life!< /Text>

Guys, dont waste your time going to Mega Malls and having to deal with vultures who want to screw you over. Go to Bellflower and see for yourselfs.</Review><gmapID>0x80dd32a9e9776c2f:0x1f8333cef241dbc7<//gmapID><rating>5</rating>< time>

<review>This place sucks!  Never again will I set foot in this $#@!&% store.  They sell broken crap and they do not stand by it they told me I broke it. Hey it was not an expensive purchase but still.  They can only screw me once.

The problem is that most Suzuki Dealers suck also.  So far Del Amo sucks,Bellflower Motorsports sucks and Long Beach Motorsport sucks.  I will try Southland next but I am seriously considering changing bikes so I can have another brand were ALL the dealers don't suck.

Avoid Bellflower Motorsports. Not worth going there.  Dishonest to the max.  Right now I would have to say do not buy a Suzuki although they are great bikes their dealers are terrible.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great, service! I purchased my Suzuki S40 and Doug took very good crae of my needs. He explained features, pricing and financing options with absolutley no pressure. Made my experience excellent, I dont like the pushy sales techniques most of the big dealers have. no talking to 4 diffrent people to buy one bike. I would reccommend to friends without a doubt!< /review>

I bought my first bike at a mega store in covina and even though I walked out with a bike, it left me feeling like I had been taken. Second bike I bought I decided to go to everyone else but them. I knew what I wanted to pay for the bike I really wanted. After failed attempts at other locations I dropped in to see what they had at BFMoto. I met Doug and told him what I was looking for. He had an answer for me within 5 minutes. Signed the paperwork and was out in 40 min. Now on my third bike and I still shopped around. Last person I went to see was Doug and he was just as helpfull as before. I should have started here... i have reccomended this place to my brother and my friends. Dougs been a straight shooter from the beginning. Hope to keep doing business here.
No experiences in the parts dept. Or service dept. As of yet but when I do ill post a review.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) To start is difficult to communicate by phone after more than an hour I got it, just to leave me on hold for almost 40 minutes, I was attended by a lady who asked me my data to return the call because they were very busy. This was more than an hour and nothing. They should put more lines or hire more staff. "Organize" or you will continue to lose customers.

I usually love the service and ice cream here, this is my go-to ice cream spot. But when I ordered my 2 scoop sundae, I recieved half the amount I normally get. And when I asked for strawberries as my topping he gave me 1 STRAWBERRY. I'm very disappointed with the sundaes I received tonight.</Text>

<Review>I went to 31 Flavors this afternoon.  I was greeted by employee, Lily with a nice "Welcome to 31 Flavors."   Lily is always cheerful and nice.  I have been coming to this one for awhile or when I am in the area.

Lily has always been pleasant and very nice.  She is very professional and friendly. I wished all your 31 Flavors had employees had the same attitude like Lily.

Please keep smiling and greet all your customers with a beautiful smile.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< Rate>

Of course, we all love what BR has to offer, but this particular one stood out to me because of the service.  The 2 young gals that were working that evening were welcoming, helpful & sincere.  They made eye contact when they addressed me & they were genuinely friendly.  I left there feeling NOT one bit guilty about the double scoop of chocolate peanut-butter I was about to indulge in.  Thanks ladies!<//Text>

So just stopped by here with my daughter to get some ice cream been coming here for years we sat in the car and ate it while we talked she took pics of the ice cream and wanted to take a pic of the open sign loves taking pics of everything as so many young people do after she gets back in the car a lady from the store confronts her and says “did you just take a picture” proceeds to walk up to my daughters window my daughter replied yes I just wanted to take a picture of the place cuz I liked it the lady then says “well next time let the workers know because they were afraid they’re doing something wrong” first of all we live in a social media world this is not odd behavior kids and adults take pics of EVERYTHING second what are you afraid of doing wrong???? Hmmm
I’ll be rethinking where I eat ice cream for the next time kinda ruined the whole experience</Text>

Great service and very clean with a big selection of flavors. The ice cream cake was a little expensive I thought and that is why I give 4 stars...<//text>

<Review>yesterday when I went to baskin Robbins location in Covina on grand ave idk if the employee was upset because I got there maybe 2 minutes before he was closing but I ordered a banana split didn’t pay much attention to it when I got it at first. But on my way home the scoops were so small that I could literally pick up each scoop with my spoon. It was so upsetting that I didn’t enjoy it i tasted more banana then I could taste ice cream. That’s how small the scoops were. I know for a fact that they weren’t even kids scoop size that he gave me. This is not correct and every Customer should receive the same amount of customer care from beginning to end. I’m paying for my banana split not the employee. It was so upsetting to the max. I hope something can be resolved in regards to this. I already contacted corporate about this as well.

We came to Baskin Robins and enjoyed our ice in this location. The lady that helped us was great that she greeted us when we came and thanked us for coming in. You don't see that in stores anymore.</text>

Stopped by on my road trip to San Diego. Wait staff were excellent. Ordered the seafood chowder, the bacon dates, and the poke tostada. All food was delicious and extremely fresh. Coffee was fresh also. View from where we were sat is beautiful. If you get cold, they also have blankets. Thank you to Angel and Trevor!!! Great, excellent, extremely clean restaurant and restrooms!! A must stop for the food and service with a view!!!</review>

<Text>Love here!!!! I visited here at night on weekday. A DJ played enjoyable music, so everyone danced together:) I drank alcohol and had an appetizer, salad, and fish tacos. All of them were perfect. Especially I liked fish tacos. That was the best fish tacos I've ever had. I'm gonna definitely visit here again.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHGUTNKkRknWH4VUA7LIFXE_oE4xTFMZmk_685=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Really delicious cocktails! And the wet burrito was fantastic with the Pier Pressure! The staff was super friendly and let us sit outside for over 4 hours! Beautiful view with great food and drinks. Love it!<//Review>

<Name>Erika Paige< /Name><Date>1562700903051<//Date><Text>The food was incredibly fresh and delicious! My family decided food was far superior, we got more bang for our buck vs going to Fishermans. Also, BEST clam chowder we’ve ever had.

Just a note to non-cilantro fans: a few of the dishes we had included cilantro. Didn’t bother me, but my mom doesn’t care for it. So, I’d double check before ordering if it is something you don’t like. It came on my mom’s Thai noodles and the calamari.<//Text>< pics>

Pretty disappointed in our experience. I have wanted to go here for so long and finally was able to go to celebrate my best friend getting a new job. There was maybe one or two other tables that were full during our time. When we arrived the hostess was chatting at the bar with another co worker, saw us, then continued to talk until maybe a manager told her to help us. Throughout our dinner we had to keep asking for someone to get our server to order drinks and food. For the price of dinner, I do feel like we should have had better service. The food was good, and the drinks good as well- but nothing exciting. I normally don’t give low reviews but this was a really disappointing experience.< /text>

Great food and great service. Was visiting a few friends who love close by so we stopped in for a quick bite and the food was good. Service is a bit slow but they were busy. We'd come back!</Text>

We went there for drinks and the staff honestly was the best out of the whole experience there! The owner (Mark) made us feel so welcomed and was constantly checking on us! And our waiter Robert was an absolute delight if you happen to get him as a waiter you’re in for a treat he’s great! Drinks were great. Next time I’m definitely going during happy hour or brunch! Excellent spot to chill and have a great time in San Clemente!<//text>

<review>Went for the first time on Saturday.we ordered a budlight and they said they were out so we ordered 2 Pacifico's  2 vodka cran and 2 kamikaze shots. We ended up with 2 Pacifico's and 2 kamikaze beverages no shots. I told the waiter we had to get in and out so we didn't miss our train and it still too 25 min.plus it was 50$ for 4 drinks!

The prices are more than reasonable for what you get, and I've never had an order of eggs over medium (the trickiest of all diner eggs) prepared over or under-done there. They also make great omelets, and a solid selection of various takes on a Benedict.</Text>

Food was amazing as always. Chef Abi is really an artist and he takes such pride in his job. Can't wait to go again when the new menu comes out.<//review>

<Text>Stopped by on my road trip to San Diego. Wait staff were excellent. Ordered the seafood chowder, the bacon dates, and the poke tostada. All food was delicious and extremely fresh. Coffee was fresh also. View from where we were sat is beautiful. If you get cold, they also have blankets. Thank you to Angel and Trevor!!! Great, excellent, extremely clean restaurant and restrooms!!</Text><response>None</response>< UserId.>

Multiple waiters consistently not weaing masks correctly over their nose. Tables were no where close to being 6 feet from each other as required by the county and state during this pandemic. My back was almost touching another person. Felt unsafe. Asked if they had vegan options. They said no... looked at a menu and they did in fact have vegan dishes.<//review>

Maybe is good and best choice if you eat there, because I order to go and this entree's of shrimp and guac is just not enough for the almost $18 fancy but not good size to eat for the price, i will not recommend if you are really hungry</Text>

Food was really good. We had breakfast there and everything was great!  The place seemed a bit pricey but I guess that is to be expected in the touristy spot  of San Clemente.</review>

<Text>Good food, right on the water but the service was a bit slow and awkward. He walked up to us and literally didn't say anything. We had to ask for drinks. It was weird. But I would still go back because of location and the food was decent. Maybe just train your servers how to talk to people 😂< /Text><date>1575211522247<//date>< Pictures>

<Text>Booked a reservation with Open Table for 9:00 am this morning.  We wete there but the restaurant was not open at 9:00. Checked web site and it told us would open at 11:00. Went to Fisherman's and had a lovely breakfast.  Subsequently got snarky text message from Open Table that we no-showed for our reservation. Really, people???? Open on time. Couldn't post on Open Table, but this was ridiculous. But, thank you. We had a wonderful breakfast at Fisherman's.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great seafood Bar with great views of the ocean and sun down. We had simple fish and chips, but you can also order fancy seafood platter, oysters, etc. Service is fast and very cordial. We enjoyed our stop and dinner including draft beer very much!</text>

Great cocktails and a good beer list. Kitchen closed at 9 PM, 2 hours before posted closing time. Nice atmosphere and simply great location across the street from the San Clemente pier and the beach. Also offers daily breakfast.< /review>

My wife and daughter ordered the Atlantic Salmon and I had the Skirt Steak. The ladies said it was the best salmon dish they’ve ever had. My steak was delicious also. Homemade cheesecake was another great success. I’d recommend The Pierside Restaurant to everyone.</Text>

<Review>The ambiance draws you in... We watched the sunset while at the bar after a nice walk on the beach.
Delicious food with some very fresh seafood selections... Great craft beer that has an ever-changing list and unique cocktails.
Rick was on point with everything suggested and really made a good date night bartender.  We'll be back to see him for sure.
Great service!<//Review>< pics>

The Pierside Kitchen and bar was a convenient little walk from the San Clamente Train Station. The location is quite beautiful facing the Pacific Ocean. The vibe here is relaxing with a beach rustic decor. The sandwich I got was tasty and reasonably priced. Server was friendly. Wait was short. Stop by sometime. Bon appetit yo.😎👍</Review>

Had a terrific dinner here -- food was tasty, and interesting without trying too hard. The service was friendly and we were seated immediately on a Friday night and the server was attentive but not bothersome. There is live music on weekend evenings I believe. I would definitely visit again - and imagine summer sunsets make this beach view spot popular then!<//Text>

<text>Super friendly and helpful staff, great drinks. I'm not a cold seafood guy which seems to be a major feature here, but there are more than enough options otherwise. The chicken sandwich was awesome, good sweet potato fries, great fish & chips, great clam chowder. Good beer selection as well. The view is really nice too if you're luck enough to be outside or near the front!</text>< Pictures>

I love the sweet potato frys too. our server was very nice and we were able to get the fish and chips even though they were serving off the brunch menu when we came in... We found parking on the street in front, but there is a large community lot available as well.  I love the central location of this place too... we went right out the front door and out for a stroll on the pier.  Check these guys out next time you are in San Clemente... I know we will.<//Text>< Time>

Cozy little place across the street from San Clemente Pier. The food is quite good, you can tell the kitchen staff puts effort into it. The wait staff is excellent, very friendly, helpful but not intrusive. Prices are not bad considering that this is a popular beach town. They also have happy hour on week nights; a live band usually plays on Friday nights.< /review>

Good food selection. Reasonable prices. Good portions. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo during brunch. They don't show a kids menu, but my two year old was able to have chicken bites and fries. Nice views out the front of the restaurant to the pier and ocean.<//Review>

I can't speak to the quality of the food, as this post is primarily in regards to this establishment's service and treatment of is guests. I visited the restaurant for brunch with my boyfriend on Superbowl Sunday earlier this year, and - although the restaurant was a bit full - we were seated by the host within a couple of minutes after checking in. Once they seated us, one of the bussers came to offer us water, and after that, everything went downhill. We were literally *never* approached by a waiter to come take our orders (despite repeated attempts to get the staff's attention), and we had started there waiting to be seen at our table for over 40 minutes. They even seated a party next to us (same two-person size), took their orders, and had them served before we finally were so fed up with their clearly intentional avoidance that we left. During the entire time we were patiently waiting to be attended to, we noticed that other tables that had been served had issues with either the bill they were charged or the food they had received (some combination of wrong orders and unsatisfying food quality). The only reason I can think of as to why they never served us is that we were the only patrons of color in the entire restaurant at that time, and I truly felt like we were being singled out for it as if I had gone back in time to the civil rights era. Maybe the food is good, but the terrible, seemingly discriminatory service really should be reason enough not to come here. I would not recommend to anyone who values their time or being treated with respect, and would never return on principle. Even if the issue was just one incompetent employee that was ill- equipped to do his job, I fault management as well for allowing this kind of behavior and poor, inconsistent customer service standards along its employees.<//Text>

Great indoor outdoor experience across from the pier in San Clemente. Taco Tuesday is great also. A little small so call for reservations or have a plan b if they cannot seat you. Don't seem to turn tables very fast.< /text>

34 people seated inside (including the two of us). 12 minutes to even be greeted by our server. He was nice enough, but needs to learn about personal space. It's been 20 plus minutes waiting for our food to arrive, but our server just came by and made sure to tell us he "just saw our food in the window". As to why he couldn't bring it to us is unclear to me.< /review>

<date>1481058803597</date><rating>5< /rating><Review>We visit this restaurant when my husband has WSA surf contests at the San Clemente Pier. This restaurant never has a wait (which is weird to me since it's so close to the beach). The food gets delivered quickly and is always fresh. We had the short rib benedict and the "standard" and it was just the right amount of food. The coffee is really good at this place as well. Prices are reasonable. Our server, Brenden, did a great job making sure we were taking care of and pleased.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGCtJuMdgcaYR7mESk6j_gVLTRbaI9WsS1A95s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

< review>
We went for taco Tuesday. I had fish tacos which were very good. Above-average. My boyfriend has been there before and has had their chicken tacos. He said they have changed because they we're a little different like basil was in the ingredients and so he was slightly disappointed. He thought the fish and the chicken tacos tasted exactly the same.<//review>

<text>Highly recommended for date night or birthday!

Great location, fantastic drink selection, and the food really hits the spot. The staff is friendly and attentive, albeit a little overwhelmed. I stopped by for the Taco Tuesday and the tacos did not disappoint. The portions are generous, the meat is cooked perfectly, and each has their unique flavor with assorted toppings (al pastor came with fresh pineapple cubes!). The side salad with vinaigrette was a bit underwhelming though the tomatoes were very fresh. A side of french fries rounded out the meal, not over seasoned and hot out of the kitchen. Of drinks I recommend their signature Rye Tai, a craft beer from their selection (I'll take Allagash or Artifex), or a Pacifico with lime to make Taco Tuesday complete.

This restaurant's location is almost unbeatable. Located at the bottom of Del Mar right across the street from the San Clemente Pier. With shops and tourist traps surrounding the Pierside patio you'll get a bird's eye view of activity at one of the most popular destinations in southern California, not to mention a breathtaking view of the sunset behind the island offshore.

Worst service I have experienced in a long time. I sat there 10-15 mins while other tables were acknowledged , bussed, new guests were seated before the guy who originally sat me there finally circled back. By the time he asked if I wanted a drink I informed him I had already found a better restaurant. Check out The Cellar. Lost the view but gained great food/ drinks/ service. P.s. Do something about the flies also.< /text>

The drinks were good but we got 2 cocktails and 3 beers and the total was over $50. The view was great but the service was lacking. The waiter was clearly annoyed that we were just stopping in to get drinks even though we were straight forward with him.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I had the single worst restaurant experience of my life at this restaurant. It was so bad it resulted in me calling the police.

We called ahead and asked if we needed a reservation around noon. We were meeting my mother for her 65th birthday in San Clemente, and chose this restaurant because it had a patio that allowed dogs. We were told we did not need a reservation.

My wife, mother, and I arrived at about 1:30, and were told by a young hostess that we would need to wait. So we ordered drinks and waited for an hour. The hostess never said anything to us during this time. We never informed that we could sit inside with our dog. We were left alone to sit for an hour.

At the end of the hour, I went inside to check our table, at which point we were told that we couldn't eat there anymore because the kitchen was closed. This was clearly a huge error on the part of Pierside. We asked to talk to the manager, at which point Owner/Manager Keon Nayebdadash appeared to talk to us.

Instead of apologizing profusely for their error and their miscommunication, he became visibly furious and got in our faces (yes, including my fiance and 65 year old mother). This is a huge man, yelling at us and asking us if we "want to take it outside." My mom explained that it was her birthday and he said, "I don't care about the context," in her face. One of his employees said, "You better watch out, he knows the police!" It was the most shocking and incredible experience I have had in years.

We left the restaurant and retreated to a cheap pizza joint down the street where we had my mother's 65th Birthday meal. We called the police because we were so rattled, but they were not able to do anything.

Long story short, don't go to this restaurant unless you want your family bullied by a scary thug manager who has no business 1000 miles from a customer service job.< /Review>< pictures>

The busser cleared the apps and our waitress came over and presented the check. We had to inform her that we hadn’t received our entrees yet. Another 10 mins for them to arrive and then we never saw her ever again. She deliberately avoided a it table for the rest of the evening. Not cool.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We are natives to So Cal and locals to San Clemente for 4 years, this was our favorite brunch spot until recently. Service takes REALLY long (10+ minutes for water), 15 minutes for a cocktail & bottomless mimosas means you should never see the bottom of your glass. We had to chase the servers down for everything. On the visit yesterday, it was for a friend's birthday. Due to the slow service, we weren't done with our meal until 2:45 (reservations at 12:30), only to be told that the kitchen was closed so we couldn't order dessert. The waitress said there was last call at 1:30 and we hadn't asked for anything in over an hour. There was no "announcement" and we couldn't ask anything of a non-existent waitress, yet this was somehow our fault? Very unprofessional, we won't be back for a while.</review>

If you could bring a C+ to life, Pierside would be it's physical form.
They have entrées they CAN charge more for, but they execute them with the bland beckiness of a Sysco delivery truck. The fish is frozen as are the hamburger patties...they taste fine and all but it's no secret to your tongue. The "wasabi" soba noodles under the ahi might as well be tossed in mayo... If that's not already what they do.
The one drink I had was the weekly special... a dragon fruit tequila cocktail which sounded great... But like the soba noodles... Tasted uninspired and fell flat.
It makes me wonder if the whole point is to keep from scaring away the local Beckies with too much flavor in fear of being labeled "ethnic"

Server was kind though. Loved her.<//review>

Usually go for the craft cocktails, but in the spirit of mardi gras, they're serving capirinhas and I'm drinking them. They're like mom would make them if she made capirinhas.

What do you look for when choosing a "Place to eat"? Biggest Portions?  Lowest price?  Biggest buffet or maybe who has the best deal on a pitcher or Lucky Lager?

Dining Experience.  When I go out I want it to do something for me.

Pierside makes me fee good.
Love this place. I leave satisfied each time.
If I am having just an appetizer and a craft beer.
Filet  and wine.?

Pierside you watch the sun setting over the pacific and listen to the live music and all of the friendly chatter and laughter.
The food is excellent. craft beer o-plenty
Comfortable and casual.

There are Restaurants and then there are Bars.
Pierside is home.  Welcome back.

The Friendly service has awesome recommendations depending on your personal taste and mood.
When I walk in I am asked how I feel and what I am in the mood for.
If I was hot and said I need something lite and cool.
Well I let them choose for me.  And the Seared Ahi Salad arrives to accompany My very refreshing drink.  Which I have to give Scuba Steve credit on this one and many others.  Ask for the #ScubaTea It really tastes like tea but with a wobble.
The Seared Ahi is no longer a menu item but if we all ask Keon to bring back the Ahi it will make it a perfect day
Order yourself a drink called #TheScubaTea

Be sure to tell them G. Douglas Sent you.

They sell individual pie slices from a local pie maker in Atascadero. The music they play is usually pretty nice. They have books, board games, and darts to stay occupied while visiting.

<Review>I've been going to Lake Auto and Smog since they first opened in Lake Elsinore back in 2015. They have helped my family with countless car issues ranging from simple oil changes and smog inspections to an entire engine and clutch replacement on one vehicle and rebuilding an axle assembly on another. They have helped sort out complicated electrical problems, ignition issues, and replaced parts from motor mounts to sensors, belts, hoses and more. They have been very honest, transparent and trustworthy and we have recommended them many times and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.< /Review>< Response>

Good family-owned business this is where you would want to go if you want a honest mechanic. Him and his son are good people places small but they get the job done<//review>

I've used Nacho's services for oil changes,  brakes,  etc. Service is quick, professional and reasonable.  If Nacho wasn't raider fan it'd be perfect.  Try them.<//Review>

Don’t come here! The guy told my mom to bring her car back before 2 PM. When we got there 15 minutes before 2 he was locking up. Mom mentioned to him about him telling her to come back before 2 and he just shrugged his shoulders and said we closed. Poor customer service!< /Text>
<pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1552332321753, 'text': 'I apologize for this misunderstanding and the inconvenience.  When you came in to the shop around 10-11 you asked me what time I closed and I replied at 2.  You told me you were going to drive the vehicle around to try to get it ready for smog but never mentioned what time you were coming back.  Like you stated, you showed up when I was already closing and had all the smog machines shut off.  If you would like to come in before 430 during the week, I will be glad to check your vehicle to see if it is ready to be smogged.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

This is some of the best pizza that I've ever had. I would recommended Pippy's Pizzeria to anyone who loves pizza.

Also the staff is super nice and the inside is super clean. My go-to place for pizza from now.</Review>

Where do I start? The service is GREAT! All employees greet you as you come in and answer all your questions nicely. The food is delicious. They have their own sauce and dough recipe, it’s so good. You can definitely taste the difference. Everything is made fresh to order and the wait is not bad at all. Last but not least the price. We got a family meal and received so much DELICIOUS food for such a good price. We’re a family of six and this is the first time we have eaten so well at such a great price. We will absolutely be back!< /review>

I picked up a pepperoni pie today as I was heading home from my errands in the city and was very pleasantly surprised with an amazing pizza that likened those from my childhood in Long Beach. The crust was nice n thin bubbly and airy with just the right amount of chewiness. The sauce was thick, plentiful and not over spiced, the cheese was generous and the pepperoni was sliced thickly enough to be flavorful. And it wasn’t overpriced. I ate one piece on my way home and divided up the other slices for the freezer. They’ll crisp right up in my convection oven.

I’ll definitely return.</review>

<Review>Great friendly environment. The workers are polite and friendly and will go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal.
Customer service rating: 5 Stars

Cleanliness:4 stars(its a bit cluttered inside and compacts waiting area.

Menu choices: 4 stars ( a lot to choose from. Pizza,pasta,wings,onion rings,bread sticks,ect. Not a lot of pizza topping choices)

Prices: 4 stars (prices are a bit on high side as is the wait time.)

Food taste: 3 stars
For the food I've only tasted the pepperoni pizza and bread sticks so the rest of the menu is still up in the air. The pizza was met for lack of words. Cheesy yes but the crust had no flavor. Same with the bread sticks. The bread sticks were big but not a lot of flavor. The mozzarella sauce tasted a bit watered down.

All in all this place had a great atmosphere and I will try it again. Food was on the plain side but ill give it another try because of the friendly workers and hopefully today maybe was a off day for the chef. I have high hopes for this pizza place if they get the seasoning a little kick.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80db6f2c78c7bb73:0x5a77bc9d55d5a4e2</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nothing out of the ordinary, sauce is ok maybe if the sauce had a stronger flavor and the pizza was left in the oven longer this could be better also for some odd reason the dough tasted a little like high school pizza dough. 6.2 out of 10 to me.< /Text>

The owner is very friendly, however took an extra 30 minutes to make and wasn’t even started when I went to pick up. The food is mediocre nothing to rant and rave about, pizza is like any other and breadsticks are plain. But that’s how most Hemet restaurants are, mediocre.<//Review>

<Text>If you are looking for the BEST pizza in Hemet,... just come to Pippy's Pizzeria. Place your order and enjoy your pizza.  It doesn't get any easier than that. Their pizza is not just good,.... it is GREAT and that's the truth it REALLY is.  I am NOT an employee, or related to anyone that is, nor have I received any form of compensation for this review.  I honestly believe the best pizza in Hemet will be found at Pippy's Pizzeria.  All I can suggest is try their pizza for yourself and you make a review,........tasting is believing.<//Text>< userid>

This is one great pizza place! Do not go to the others that charge double or triple the price. The owner and employees are all extremely kind and helpful. This is one business that takes pride in their product, which is hard to find these days. They make an excellent pizza!

I 10/10 recommend you try Pippy’s, you will not be disappointed.</text>

Great experience! We were driving back home from the mountain and stumbled upon this place. Not only was the owner (man in charge) extremely helpful and kind, but the food and price was great. Highly recommend for a great experience, good food and a friendly owner!< /review>

I am glad we decided to change it up a bit and order pizza from a new place for us. We absolutely loved it!! To top of the fact that the pizza was awesome the service was amazing, the owner was extremely sweet and made sure I was happy with my order before I left. Definitely gonna make this our new regular spot, looking forward to trying the wings next time.</Text>

I have tried all the pizzeria in New York City and New Jersey—moved to Hemet Ca. only to fine the best and I MEAN the BEST pizza at Pippy’s Pizzeria in Hemet. If you like Calzones or Pasta or appetizers they have it all.  My husband is very fussy about spaghetti — not any longer —Pippy’s has anything and everything you will want. Best part is the friendly atmosphere and on time service. You will love it !!<//Text>

It is so hard to find good authentic italian food in the area, if you are like me and want that homemade taste and flavor this is the place to be!!! I ordered a pepperoni pizza and lasagna, hands down best lasagna I've had in years!!! Cooked and seasoned perfectly! The pizza was amazing as well, the crust is awesome. I believe the owner helped me at the register, super nice guy! He took the time to welcome me and explain what he had made for me and went over my order. Love Love Love this place!!!  First of many meals to come from Pippy's.  Support this great local business and enjoy some top notch italian food!!!!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

My niece bought a personality pizza at lunchtime from pippys. She said it was really good so I called and placed an order  for a large pepperoni. I went in for pick up where I met the owner, he was really nice and had a super clean place. He’s in the process of putting in a bar.also. Took my pizza home for lunch with the family and it was hot! I loved the crust and just the right amount of greasy cheese and a lot of pepperoni. All in all a darn good pizza for a good value. If you want to support a local business and get a good pie, check out pippy’s<//text>

Whether you're passing through or live anywhere near this place. It's worth the stop. The owner and employees greeted and cared for us like family, which is rare these days. The pizza is one of the best I've had and having the staff that supports that claim is the icing on the cake.</Text>

Wow! Really flavorful and yummy! We ordered 5 pizzas to go and they were ready and piping hot. We've tried all the places in town and have been disappointed and let down time after time. Last weekend we voted to give George's another try- disappointed yet again- no cheese, barely any sauce.
First time at Pippy's- was a breath of fresh air! Lovely homemade crust , lots of cheese, not skimpy at all with toppings. Owner made our Friday night awesome!</text>

<Review>The pizza is great and the customer service is even better! They have made sure it was piping hot and ready when I needed! I even had to order 25 pizzas and they did a phenomenal job of it even when they had to open early just to make my order. I will be coming here for a long time! Great pricing compared to other small shops like pippys. I have now ordered 3 times and had the same experience each time.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Amazing place, one of those diamonds in the rough. If you want good quality Italian food this is the spot. We had the white sauce pizza that was perfect the crust was just right. The chicken wings put other places to shame, crispy yet so juicy. The chicken alfredo is so good. We will be back.</text><Gmap_id>0x80db6f2c78c7bb73:0x5a77bc9d55d5a4e2< /Gmap_id>< time>

Absolutely love this place. The flavor of the pizza is way better than any fast food pizza in hemet. Excellent customer service. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great pizza at reasonable price. Pizza hut and domino's need to step up their game.</text>

<review>Great customer service from the get go, greeted by the owner and he attended us himself was very helpful with any question we had. Food we didn’t order pizza just had a few order of wings with different flavors & let me tell you, some of the best bone-in wings I’ve had in town!

After 11 years, my search in Hemet is over. This pizza was very good. I could tell as soon as the box was opened, that this was as close to NY pizza, I have seen in a long time.  The dough and ingredients were fresh. All the kids ate the crust. The sauce was flavorful, but not overbearing. We plan on going back, for sure.<//review>< pictures>

You know that pizza you always see in cartoons but never see in real life? That’s the kind they have here. I came today for the 2nd time in a row and i don’t forsee going anywhere else.< /text>

Tried pippys for the first time it was delicious   the pasta  was full of flavor   the pizza  was gone in less than 8 minutes  the kids  gobbled it all up  the customer service was superb,  at the moment I am  fighting off a food coma that has been brought on by all this delicious  food also known as the (itis)</Review>

I have owned my own shop, and know the quality of product when I taste it, and appreciate the efforts that go into running a small business. Hemet is very lucky to have this Family business, and should support it!!!!
I have, like many of you, tried all the pizza shops, except the chains. I am a strong supporter of local business, this shop is excellent and reflects the love that it takes to make quality food.  Best pie and price from here to Tustin..thanks for your efforts, sacrifice.<//text>

I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the pizza was here.  Fantastic!  My family loved it.  Not a piece left over.  I got fettuccini for my son and i thought it was good but i don't recommend it for kids because they were very heavy handed with the garlic.  I will definitely be back.< /Text>

<Text>For a place that doesn't make Bbq Chicken pizza they certainly did an amazing job. The pizza taste great! Only reason why it's not five stars is because it wasn't hot when I got it. Other then that great pizza can't wait to try the Cooper!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80db6f2c78c7bb73:0x5a77bc9d55d5a4e2< /Gmap_id>< username>

<review>Horrible. The pizza wasn't really cooked even though We specifically asked for WELL DONE, the sauce had a weird flavor to it. Cheese didn't really melt. Thank goodness we only ordered one. I got a salad (thankfully) however the Tomatoes were old and wrinkled. Their soda machine was completely out of order, watered down tea, No Pepper, No sugar, although the menu said mozzarella sticks they didn't have any. The garlic parmesan butter wings were good, we thought they should try that sauce on a pasta. We were the only people there. Needless to say WE WILL NOT GO BACK AGAIN!! They keep this up they won't be in business long.</review><user_id>115109468299909869775< /user_id><user_name>carol hillidge<//user_name>< time>

< Review>
First time visit to Pippy's pizzeria. The restaurant had  classic pizzeria decor and looked very kept and clean. The owner was so welcoming and  contagiously positive and seemed very proud of his place! We ordered the "Cooper" pizza and the bourbon wings. Everything was made fresh and came out quickly! The bourbon wings where awesome and the pizza was tastey! We will deffinatly visit again soon and tell our friends and family to stop by too!< /Review>

Firstly I must say, probably the best customer service experience I've had in my entire life. A short interaction that definitely made an impression.
I was recommended by a coworker to give Pippys a try, and I'm very glad I did. Placed my order online, which was quick and easy.
First thing I noticed, was the very affordable prices, paid $20 for an XL pepperoni pizza and 6pc wing, And that was including tip. In 25 min my order was ready for pickup. Arrived to a gentleman on the phone and he politely acknowledged me and I waited patiently. As soon as he finished his phone order, he promptly greeted me with a smile and a genuine sense of pride in the establishment(which was spotless, organized and very cozy).
He brought my order, reviewed my items for accuracy and handed them over. He proceeded to wish me a happy valentines day for myself and my family, and wished me a safe drive home.
When I arrived home, my family and I proceeded to enjoy a very well made pizza. Crispy crust on the outside and soft on the inside, taste was very fresh, flavor was very nice. I've seen some reviews complaining of plain crust, which I do not see as a negative trait.  Most pizza places treat the crust like garlic bread,  and I find it refreshing when a crust can be enjoyable with no added flavors or ingredients. My only suggestion is a little lighter on the seasoning on the pizza itself, a little strong. But overall this pizza was and is now in my top three local pizzas, only rival to San Biagios in Upland, and Black Market brewery in Temecula.
Next is my favorite food, the chicken wings, which I usually critique pretty strongly at establishments. And WOW,fresh tasting chicken, perfectly crispy, tossed in a well balanced buffalo sauce that's not over spicy, or overly sweet. Meaty flats, and substantial drums. To this point, Idyllwild Brew pub had my favorite local wings, and Pippys has now taken that spot over. Superb wings.

Overall, my experience was excellent, and I will absolutely return again. But the star of the show was the short and amazing customer service experience that I encountered.
This is a small local place that is quickly building a reputation, and I suggest if you've had a bad experience here, to give it another go as it's always better to give a second chance to a local establishment with heart, than a multimillion dollar chain that seldom cares about its customers. For the same price as a major chain, you can get a higher quality meal, and will help support a local gem. Keep it up guys< /review>

The owner was awfully friendly. I tell you these family owned restaurants offer some of the greatest service. A friendly reminder to support your local economy!  Thanks for your hospitality, Ariel.< /text>

Both doctors, the mother and son are always a delight to see for my eye appointments. They are always compassionate, empathetic, and have a sense of humor. The admin staff is always professional and informative as well. I recently had an emergency and they were able to squeeze me in that day. I was so thankful. And while I was in the waiting room, I saw the admin staff do their best to find room for a mom's son's checkup even though their daughter was the only one scheduled to make things easier for the mom!<//review>

Both Dr Lili Chia and David Chia are wonderful. Friendly, thorough, professional. The retinal imaging is fantastic as no eye dilation is needed. Dr. David Chia performed my laser Photocoagulation. It was quick, painless, and efficient. Dr. David Chia is competent and skillful. I trust him completely.<//Text>

<review>I will try writing my comment again, as it just disappeared.  You scheduling was very poor yesterday, as I had to wait foo long with too many people in your waiting room and elsewhere.  Dr. David Chia is wonderful, and I am sure he would like for you to use more caution.  One woman barely slid by me as she took her chair.  I will be 89 years in a couple of months and I stay away from people as much as possible.  I think you should use more care also.  I must have the first appointment after lunch next years for my annual.  Thank you.< /review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Dr. Chia was very attentive to my concerns as a new patient. He is very passionate about prevention and encourages patients to do what they can to take care of their eyes and vision. He is honest, straightforward, transparent, and practical, which is what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for an ophthalmologist in the OC area. His website is easy to navigate and use to make appointments, which adds convenience. His office is up to date on office technology as well as clinical technology, which is reassuring. The front desk receptionists and assistants could probably be a little warmer in their customer service, but that doesn’t have much to do with Dr. Chia - it’s probably just their personalities.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcdd69c4d90789:0xe7c8874f902d1200< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My family and I have been seeing Dr. Chia for years.  We wouldn’t go anywhere else. He is so kind and always so informative. He will always be honest with you and treat you as if you are one of his family members. He is the best eye surgeon around. I recommend him to everyone.</text>

I’m not sure how they have so many good reviews, but I would not recommend this business. I went there for a specific issue I was having with my eyes, which had already been diagnosed by my optometrist, but I wanted a second opinion.

I saw Dr. Li-Li Chia, and she did not even ask why I was there for an appointment. She started prescribing me contacts, which is not what I was there for. I told her I was not there for contacts, because the eye issue I have actually prevents me from wearing contacts. She proceeded to continue to prescribe me contacts and didn’t listen to me when I verbalized that again, I was not looking for contacts.

She prescribed something for the issue I was having, but didn’t even look at my eyes for more than 15 seconds.

In comparison to the optometrist I’ve been seeing, he looks at my eyes with a high level of detail and dyes to look at this issue. Dr. Chia did none of that.

Very disappointed, a big waste of time. Do not recommend.< /Text>

Irvine Eye Physicians are the best. Both Dr. Chia and Dr. Chia are wonderful. I enjoy having built rapport with Dr. Chia over the past ten or more years. We get to update each other on life and he is able to keep my eyes in order. Wonderful office with great staff too.< /text>

I have already recommended Dr. Chia to a friend. On my first visit I felt that I had a thorough exam, was listened to with genuine interest, and given medically sound advice. I also felt comfortable with the COVID-19 protocols in place.  I was given a plan of action and left with reassurance that I had a great new member on my team. I look forward to exploring his website and all the information it offers.<//review>

This was our first visit and we are so happy we found Dr. David Chia. He was so patient and took time to explain exactly what was going on with my daughter’s eye. He went above and beyond even finding a specialist that was suited for her specific needs. I would highly recommend Dr. David Chia to anyone. Can’t thank him enough.<//Review>

Everyone is so friendly. The techs are prompt and efficient. I like that they don't take the time to try and chit chat. Very clinical, gets you in and out. Dr Chia does take the time to chat with you like an old friend, I only see him once every year, but he always has a smile on his face and is genuinely happy to see you.<//review>

Dr Chia is one of the best doctors I’ve been to. He is so professional and takes time to listen to me and thorough examination. He has a new optimap-very high tech instrument that eliminates dilating eyes and is more accurate.
Thank you Dr Chia.</review>

<Review>Dr. Chia performed my cataract surgery on Thursday. I can't believe how easy that was!!! I opted for the multifocal lenses and voila! I can see again!!! Amazing. Dr. Chia was professional and responsive to every question I had. I can't say enough about what a great experience I had!</Review><name>Lynda Stones< /name><pics>None< /pics><time>1605399433873</time></record>

Dr. David Chia is phenomenal.  I also have been to Dr. Lili Chia, who is terrific, too!  I saw Dr. David Chia last week, and he addressed my problem quickly, thoroughly, and with excellent insight. He gave me hope, and some good solutions.  The office is great, the staff are considerate and helpful, and Dr. Chia is a very wise young man!  I am very glad to be in their care.  Thank you!</text>

Today I went to visit the office seeing Dr. David Chia!! As always, a very pleasant trip, worth a long drive from MdR.

My entire family have been seeing Dr. Lili Chia for more than 22 years... wow time really flies.  We used to live in Irvine, then we've been living abroad in Asia and Europe for the past 6 years.  Every year we came back to LA and made appointments to visit Dr. Lili Chia and/or Dr. David Chia is like part of our family back home routines, so walking into their office feeling like visiting old friends or family... so exciting.

Dr. Lili Chia is the most professional individual we've ever experienced, always takes time w/gracious manner and patiently explains and reminds us everything, also compares any difference to the past, so down to earth, she also has such a good memory about the family members which is just sooooo amazing...  regardless she's very busy and well-known in the community which really made her as the top ophthalmologist.

We're also very happy to see Dr. David Chia joined the group since a few years ago, David is also extremely professional and personal, just like his mom, so unbelievable... Good job, Dr. Lili!!

The office staff are always sweet and polite, other than the office visit, never push us to order anything else, i.e., eye glasses or contacts... in fact, they don't even mention it, you just basically visit the doctors, pay, then walk out the office... much more professional than some of other physicians' offices that I have experience with, regardless I'm also a long time patient.

That's why we stick with the Chias forever!!</Text>

<review>Irvine Eye Physicians are exceptional. I had a slight emergency and they were able to squeeze me in the same day. They always listen and take their time examining the problem, which is rare nowadays. The diagnosis and recommendations they advise are right on every time. Both Dr. Li Li and Dr. David Chia care about their patients, which is also rare nowadays. I highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for caring eye professionals.< /review><gmapID>0x80dcdd69c4d90789:0xe7c8874f902d1200<//gmapID><Date>1594832080807</Date>< UserId.>

<Review>Dr. Lili Chia has been my Dr. for many years. I have also been seen several times by Dr.David Chia, and he is as good as Lili Chia.

I always had a sight problem with my left eye that no eye doctor had ever told me exactly what the cause was until now. I have a blind spot. It just clarified it for me. Dr. Chia is very personable and really listens. His staff is friendly, too.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd69c4d90789:0xe7c8874f902d1200<//Gmap_id>< username>

<review>Dr. Chia is an excellent eye specialist.  He is not arrogant as some other specialists.  He explains our problems  in very detailed common words , very patiently and never under any pressure , just like a good friend.  My wife had a cataract surgery by Dr. Chia in last June, she recovered very quickly and have a good vision after the surgery,   I am gong to take similar cataract surgery later this month,   We highly recommend friends to see Dr. Chia if they have any eye related problem.<//review>< pics>

Dr. Chia was very professional and explained in detail my condition and took his time with answering all my questions.  I am a dentist and appreciate his attention to detail. Because the medication I needed wasn't covered by insurance, he even tried to find the lowest priced prescription for me. Thank you very much and I highly recommend!</Review>

Dr. David Chia patiently explained everything as he examined my eyes and recommended the eye drops for soothing my eyes. I felt very comfortable and relief afterward.

Der. Li Li Chia, MD., sets the gold stand for Ophthalmologist. I am over 65 and have had physicians from all over, Yale, Harvard, USC, UCLA and she is in the top 1%. of physicians.  If they could make a mold for young physicians coming out of Med School, they should follow her footsteps...her son David is in the same 5%....and will be 1% in few more years, but he has the greatest MENTOR!< /Review>

<text>Both Dr. Li Li Chia and Dr. David Chia are phenomenal doctors. They care tremendously about their patients and their eye health. 15 years ago I was experiencing aura in my vision and had seen other ophthalmologists who treated me like I was crazy.  Dr. Li Li Chia knew immediately what I was experiencing and made me feel like my concerns were heard. I now live 2 hours away, but still return to Irvine for my yearly eye exam with Dr. David Chia because of the trust I have with their care.<//text>< Rating>

I would give zero stars if allowed, and it’s due to the unacceptable behavior of the receptionist named Grace. I came to the office to share a concern I had with my newly purchased glasses and I was faced with Grace and her argumentative demeanor. She is by far the rudest person I have ever spoken to. She refused to help me, and blamed me for the concern I shared with her by saying, I quote, “that’s your fault”. She made her point when she slammed on her desk as I walked out of the office. I’m left with the problem regarding my new glasses and no one to help me.

I would highly recommend you avoid getting glasses through her. And for the management of this firm, I would strongly advise you reevaluate whether or not you need someone like Grace working here because she has absolutely no regard for your patients.<//Text>

I saw Dr Li-Li Chia and was very impressed with the care and attention she gave me as she described the new technology mapping and my particular vision issues.  The gal that did the testing also deserves mention as she was very patient and knowledgeable.  The office staff is very friendly and efficient.< /Text>

<review>Doctor Li Li Chia is a very experienced and knowledgeable eye doctor.  My family including my mom, my dad, my daughter, my husband, and me have been seeing her for at least 25 years.  She knows all the rarely heard symptoms and addresses the potential issues right to the point.

With doctor Li Li Chia's care, my family feel rest assured we would have healthy eyes and sustainable visions.</review>< name>

<text>These are the best two eye doctors ever!  They are kind, caring, efficient, thorough, and have state of the art equipment,   You can be guaranteed you will receive the best care ever!  They have seen me through some very risky eye ulcers and even saw me over the weekend several times to make sure my treatment was being effective.  I highly recommend this office.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>This office is run so efficiently. Every area is spic and span clean. What I feel is nice is that when the techs are finished performing your tests you sit in the waitingroom again rather than being closed up in a room. Then the doctor comes and gets you for your exam. What a nice personal touch.</review><name>Chili Jean< /name><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcdd69c4d90789:0xe7c8874f902d1200</gmap_id><rating>5</rating>< user>

I was really delighted that i didn't wait for too long at the office. Everything was processing fast. I didn't  get any eyedrops to dilate for an eye exam where you get blurry for a while as i am not a fan of that. Everything was high tech ...moving one machine to other. My doctor was really smart, communicative and informative about Eye care .So overall excellent experience. Thanks< /text>

<text>I called the office because I had an eye infection and needed to see an eye doctor.  The immediately scheduled an appointment for me the same day.  I was very happy with the courtesy of the doctor and staff, and even more impressed when the doctor made a follow-up call to see how I was doing.  I would definitely recommend friends and family<//text>< Pictures>

Dr. David Chia is an outstanding surgeon and physician. I would recommend  him to anyone that needs a doctor for a basic eye exam or for complicated eye surgery.  He is supported by an equally outstanding team.< /text>

Dr. Li-Li Chia has been my eye-physician for about 10 years. I visit her once a year. As I cross 50 years of age, I feel I am in good hands with her. She considers my overall well being while making sure that my eyes remain healthy.< /text>

<review>I have been going to Irvine Eye Physicians and Surgeons for the last 25 years.  I have very poor eyesight and I always get a thorough exam and a perfect eye prescription.  Four years ago Dr. Chia found an issue with my retina during my exam and referred me to a retina specialist.  Had they not see the problem I would have lost vision that I would not have been able to get back.  I won't go anywhere else.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

There are a lot of good doctors, but Dr. Chia is simply the best.  Look no further.  Highly recommend.  She care for their patients with compassion and attention. Dr. Chia's staffs are very friendly and professional.

I was referred by my aunt to Dr. Chia. He first performed cataract surgery on my left eye five years ago. Last week, he removed a cataract from my  right eye.  I’m very happy with both doctor Chia and Surgery Center.</Text>

<Review>Irvine Eye Physicians and Surgeons has been my eye care clinic for over 25 years.  The clinic has three courteous doctors and a number of staff offering complete general eye treatment, surgery and optometric need.  I recently received cataract surgery for my eyes at this clinic.  The surgery recovered expeditiously and my eye sights are able to get to 20/25 with basic IOL and with glasses (I am used to wear glasses and elected not to use expensive special IOL).   I appreciated the clinic for my eye care.<//Review>< pics>

My appointment was with Dr. David Chia. For most of my 67 years I have had annual eye checkups but this was exceptional.  Dr. Chia is the most professional and comprehensive ophthalmologist I have met.  He explained each segment of the examination, using state of the art technology, showing me images I could understand.   I am grateful to my friend for recommending Irvine Eye Physicians to me and I intend to give my highest recommendation to others.< /review>

Service was excellent and more importantly they were very efficient.  The timing from check in, eye check, to the screening were right on schedule.  Very little wait time.  I was in and out of there in 15 minutes while still feeling I got the proper diligence and care from Dr. Chia.  Highly recommend Irvine Eye.< /Review>

<review>I was prepared to wait for a long time after seeing all the other reviews. The wait time was not bad. I had low expectations and was not surprised by anything. Dr. David Chia was excellent and that's all I came there for. Funny enough, I never thought my eyes were dry and I went to the office for a surgery consultation. Dr. Chia gives genuine and helpful advice. I took the sheet of paper he gave me with all the eye care information and purchased a bottle of eye drops from CVS last night. My eyes woke up feeling the most moist I have ever been for years! It only occurred to me then that my eyes have been super dry for a long long time, so long that I don't even notice it anymore. I recommended my husband to go there for contact lens fitting after my visit since he doesn't like his current office. Again, I love a doctor that had the patient's best interest in mind and is not there just to sell products. He also gave me his recommendation of a specialist for the surgery I came there for. The best result matters to me as much as to him, which I really appreciate. I am going to take better care of my eyes. After all, I wear contacts every day for over 12 hours.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>The only thing that bothered me this time is that the assistant who ran most of the tests wanted me to take my first test on letter recognition with my distance glasses, when I'd always done it with my reading glasses.  I didn't even have my clear distance glasses with me, just sunglasses.  But then he relented and let me do it with my reading glasses like I'd always done it before.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>All the staff in the office are patient, professional and friendly. That is rare for a doctors office. Usually you would encounter one or two that are grumpy and u happy at their jobs. This tells me that the doctors treat them right and it reflects right back at the customer service level. I came in for a new patient visit and it was a great experience. My exam was thorough by the doctors and I asked many questions which they were not hesitate to answer. The brunette in the front desk was great with cofirming my insurances and Francesca in glass fitting is gifted! I’m the type where I never find frames that I like and she found me both sun glasses and eye glasses in 15 mins. Something that I struggled with for a decade and for the first time I felt confident with wearing glasses. Overall, I highly recommend it if you need to find an optometrist.< /review><time>1519484899445<//time>< Name>

Dr. Li Li Chia is one of the best doctors I have been to. She understands the problem and prescribes eye glasses accordingly.</text>

<rate>5</rate><Time>1545408541310</Time><review>I was referred to Dr. LiLi Chia on an emergency request by my primary physician. My regular Ophthalmologist was unavailable. Dr. Chia's office couldn't have been more accommodating.  They "squeezed" me in for an appointment, and when I arrived the receptionist was professional and efficient.  After a brief eye test, again conducted by a very pleasant and professional assistant, Dr. Chia attended to me.  Dr. Chia was awesome.  She spent time explaining what she was doing, what the results were, how to treat and care for my eye.  She talked about the medications she was prescribing and what I should expect the results to be.  I would highly recommend this doctor.<//review><Name>Don Brantley</Name>< userid>

Dr. Chia is awesome, he spent alot of time with me going over my eye condition and explained both natural and rx alternatives so I could choose what was best for me. I have been going to this office for about 4 years. Very nice office, convenient locations. And great eyeglass selection.</text>

Dr LiLi Chia ,a consummate professional with a most engaging demeanor, shortens the distance between patient and physician to the patient's benefit. I have been the great beneficiary of her advice and counsel with regard to my eyes during the past 25 years, and am able to see as well as I do in the main because I have taken it. She has my highest recommendation.< /Text>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr. Chia for the past 10 years. I recently moved from CA to Texas and have not found an Opthamologist as good and thorough as Dr. David Chia in Houston. His facility has the state of the art technology that he uses during the exam. I will try to keep him as my doctor and see him during my visits back to CA.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><GmapID>0x80dcdd69c4d90789:0xe7c8874f902d1200<//GmapID><Date>1520925896762<//Date><Name>My Lam-Ly<//Name>< resp>
