<rating>5<//rating><Review>Been going to South Coast Auto for many years.  They are honest, hard working and reliable. They will tell you what needs to be done ASAP and what can wait so you can budget for it.  Over the years we have brought over 10 cars that the family has owned and they have always done a great job.  Had an Audi TT that they worked on many times.  There was one time that they could not work on it properly due to needing a specialized tool.  They told me that up front and recommended a shop that they knew and trusted.  But I appreciate that they were honest and didn't take on something that they couldn't do correctly.  True professionals.   Can't recommend them enough.  Have sent several friends and colleagues to them and they have all had the same experience</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

My dad has been bringing his vehicles here for probably 20+years. And I have been doing the same since I bought my first car. They've never made a disingenuous recommendation. Service is first come,  first serve though,  so sometimes you've gotta work things into your schedule.< /Text>

<review>This is good place. They know what they know, and they know when to send you to another specialist. Recommended to me by my female friend that admired that they didn't try to do any thing crazy with stuff that didn't need it. Very good at making sure you're rolling out of there safely!< /review>< user_name>

So far so good. I just dropped off my Honda CR-V to be checked for starting issue. I will make a review update soon.

*Update*
Keeping that 5 stars for sure! Sam was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely keep them in mind the next time I need fixin'. Everyone are very courteous, pro, and easy to deal with.< /Text>

<Review>Our daughter took in her vehicle for a second opinion. All I can say is "wow". Not only did they beat dealership pricing but were straight forward with what needed repaired and took care of everything the same day. If anyone is looking for an honest trustworthy auto shop, look no further.  This is the place to go. From minor maintenance to major repair, the team at South Coast Auto clinic will take care of your automotive needs. We are extremely happy with their service and will continue to use their services from now on. Thanks again for service well done.<//Review><date>1505315167613< /date><user_id>114935014532259977246</user_id><rate>5<//rate>< Pictures>

Have never had better auto service. My dad, mom, brother, sister, and all of our significant others will bring our cars to South Coast. These guys are professional, courteous, reasonable, and will always be honest with you and your vehicle. If you've struggled to find a good and decent mechanic that will not overcharge you for what you are looking for, these guys are it. South Coast, THANK YOU for all the great vehicle service you've provided me and my family over the years. Couldn't be happier, will always bring my car here.</Review>

Excellent!  They do just what you need, advise you of upcoming service needs, and they don't overcharge you.  We've been going there for several years with a 13-y.o. Ford and 2-y.o. Hyundai.  I've seen many other makes/mods there. They are knowledgeable, courteous, clean, and friendly.  They offer free rides back to work/home after you drop off your car.  No negatives.  It's hard to find a good car mechanic that has all this... South Coast is a keeper!</review>

My car could not start and they changed the initiator for my car and it works fine. However, they also told me to change two other components. I know that my car has a smoking problem when started and the smoke will be gone within 2 min. They told me that it is because of a rubber pipe which connected to the engine. I asked the person there whether they are confident or not. The person answered "Yes". I was happy and asked them to changed it, which costs about 160 dollars. However, the smoking problem is still there. They did not fix it. SO BE CAREFUL WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO CHANGE SOMETHING!!!<//Text>

Honest and competent, these guys have been doing great work on our cars for years. If you are looking a trustworthy shop for your vehicle maintenance, you just found it. I especially like that they put themselves in their customer's shoes, and will make suggestions on what work should be prioritized if budgets are tight, and what work can safely wait until your wallet has been replenished. If you're procrastinating taking your car for that oil change because you're worried about "what else they might find", or whether you might get stuck with a bill for some trumped-up work, just do you and your car a favor and come here.<//review>

I've been taking my BMW and LEXUS to get services and repaired here for the last 4-5 years. Excellent customer's services, professional and friendly. Sam, Sal and the rest of the gang are almost on points...and price wise, they only charged me a fraction of the dealers would, even with the factory parts. These guys are awesome.< /Review>

My wife and I have been very happy with the service and professionalism of the folks at SCAC.  We've been taking our cars here for ≈5 years and we have nothing but praise for the quality of the work, and for the great interactions we've had with Sal and others at SCAC over this period.  They would have a well-deserved 5/5 stars if not for the unhappy smog-check guy.  Very highly recommended!< /review>

<review>Our family has 4 cars that get serviced here. They never try to sell you more than you need. When you go for an oil change they check you whole car to determine if you have any problems that will soon become major problems. If you are looking for a truly honest shop this is the place for you. I have saved money and extended the life of our cars because of this shop.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>The place is decent for the price. This is not the Hilton because this neighborhood is not the Hamptons. Those who come here and complain that this place is old and rickety, complain about pillows not being new, ceiling needing  repairs, outdated furniture, must first explain what brings their first-class sensibilities to a place like Vermont and Florence to begin with.</Review><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

It was very busy, but everyone in the facility was very respectful and safe. The service was quick. Everyone in site wore their masks and kept their distance.< /review>

Do not bring your copper here. Such a ripp off. $1.10 for copper #1, and $1.15 for bare bright. I've never felt  so angry about a place until coming here.</Review>

<Text>This place is amazing for the nature of the industry. The staff is VERY HELPFUL, when my baskets are full they never hesitate to help me bring them to the scales. They are respectful, friendly and clean. The place is overall clean and the service is FAST AND EFFICIENT. I have been going there for 5 years and have NEVER been disappointed. I recycle to fundraise for an organization that builds houses to the poorest of the poor in Mexico and the members are always very quick to help me out with my recycling. I tried other places that take my recycling by the unit instead of by the weight (which is potentially more profitable) but I was ignored, even when I asked for help with a heavy bucket. California Metals has been my number one recycling place for years and I have never been disappointed. I highly recommend this place.</Text>< Name>

This place not only pays the best for recyclables, but is open every day (shorter hours on weekends) and their staff is very pleasant and professional -- and very patient with some of the more elderly or demanding customers.<//Text>

<Text>They are thief's, I count the plastic bottles 10 cents for each 2  liter bottles and I suppose to receive  $7.5 just for that, but on top of that I brought glass bottles and aluminum cans and more small water plastic bottles and at the end they only give !e 3.25 what a thief's I will report them to the better business bureau< /Text>< Pics>

I always get the veggie burrito with jalapenos. They get the ratio of rice, sour cream, and veggies just right. The papusas are excellent too. For some reason this is better than the other 2 locations. Not much space to sit, though, so I recommend takeout only.</Review>

The tacos, they were awesome. I had al pastor + beef tacos, they were absolutely fantastic. The restaurant is a bit basic, there aren't many places to sit down, but the food was mind-blowing great.<//text>

<review>Wow! What can I say. I just suffered through the worst, "Get out of my restaurant, and never come back again" burrito I've ever eaten in my life. When something is this bad, it can only be incompetence, or willful malevolence. Amazing, because I used to really like this place.  But, if you really don't want me to come back this badly, I'm happy to oblige you. Adios.</review>< Pics>

I come here for Pupusas and they're hot and delicious every time. They're also really greasy, but that is expected and not particularly worse or better than other pupuerias I've been to. They're happy to provide extra curtido when I ask.

The decor is not particularly pretty, is definitely not fancy at all, but it's fun. The place is spacious but there aren't many tables - they could probably add a couple of tables.

The parking lot is probably the worst thing about this place :)  I highly recommend it. The others I went with very much enjoyed both tacos and a burrito. We gave the food high marks around the table.</review>

My favorite burritos in the bay area! No frills type of place with super speedy and proficient burrito makers - none of that nonsense of getting all of your guacamole in one bite and none in the rest of the burrito. I recommend the carnitas or al pastor, but everything is good. Papusas are tasty too!</Review>

Now they have ample seating at their new restaurant at Rengstorff and Middlefield in Monta Loma Plaza. There's a bouncy house on Saturday and Sunday too. Same menu same family. Wonderful.</Review>

I really wanted to like this place when I came here, but in the end it was just okay.  I ordered pupusas and a carnitas burrito that I split with my fiance.  We both thought that they were solid, but there wasn't anything particularly special that made this place stand out.

I wouldn't mind coming back, but I don't think that you will be blown away by your experience here.  I'm probably spoiled from having been to some of the most incredible places in Sunnyvale that boast some delicious, authentic food.  I also didn't like the fact that they had so few seats!  Most people were left standing, and it was a little awkward eating pupusas along a narrow counter top while standing in my opinion.

Overall, this place was solid, but nothing that I would go out of my way to get.<//Text>

Got two carnitas takeout burritos (they weren't just for me) here. La Bamba seems to do a very decent job with the food, but it's unexceptional relative to La Costena next door. The menu is rather limited and doesn't give the sense that items can be customized - they can. My super burrito was very light on the guacamole, but had a good balance of beans and carnitas. Still though, not quite as first-rate as the competition.

Another highlight for me was the horchata - really solid version filled with cinnamon goodness.

Definitely don't come for the ambiance. Get in, get your food, and get going.<//Review>

Best burrito place around. The prices have gotten steep but the Grilled Chicken (Pollo Asado) Regular (not super!) Burrito is the bomb. Another fave is their Quesadilla Zuisa, it is a huge grilled steak, salsa and cheese quesadilla.< /review>

<Text>My favorite burrito in life, and I've had a few.  Don't come for the decor; come for exceptional pollo asado, carne asada, and carnitas. I can't even consider La Costena in spite of its reputation and proximity.  La Bamba is too good.</Text>< Response>

[From June 2008]

ye, carumba.  Que lastima :-(.  I had such high hopes for this place, given all the raves, and I was sorely disappointed... especially since I took my never-eaten-a-burrito-before Aussie friend here today!

I already knew that parking and seating was limited, so I won't count that against this place.  Rather, here are the things that bummed me out:
- No choice of sizes (e.g., mini/baby burrito).
- No choice of salsas (I wasn't asked "hot or mild?" like at most taquerias I've been to).
- No salsa bar!  How can you have a taqueria without any visible salsa options?!
- No chips.  I'm used to getting free chips with my burritos (or better yet, chips with pico de gallo!)
- Tacos were a bit too greasy.
- Burrito was more cheesy than salsa'y :(.
- No seafood options (e.g., prawn burrito)
- No frescas? (e.g., watermelon, strawberry...)

But there were a few good things:
- Service was pretty fast.
- Cashier was friendly.
- They take credit cards.
- The carnitas was tasty... cooked just right!  El pastor was pretty good, too.
- Tortillas are grilled, not steamed.  Big thumbs up!

Still, I really miss La Corneta from Glen Park :-(</text>

I judge it based mostly on its tacos with carnitas and its papusas, the former of which is insufficiently fatty and tasty, and the latter is soggy and the cabbage isn't as sour as I like it.

The al pastor was tasty, though.<//Text>

<Review>Pizza was over an hour late, cold...can’t say enough how disappointed we are.  Salad dressing was like water, veggies shaved so thin.   Had to call twice no one knew what was going on.  No napkins no plates, wow!</Review>< pics>

Authentic, fresh, and a selection that no other pizzeria could complete with hands down one of the best ok the Central coast! Staff are accomodating, and personable.<//review>

I love the food, but this order I am very disappointed. I ordered at 5pm and it is now 7:30pm and still no food. Called at 620pm and was told they were super busy and that I would have my order in 45 minutes that they had not even started it. I guess I will have to find a different pizza place. Will not be ordering again.<//text>

I grew up in Mission Hills & got to see Giant Manhattan Pizza at it's best! It doesn't look the same at all & definitely needs a deep clean as the registers looked dirty/dusty but I kept an open mind and didn't judge it on it's appearance. The pizza was cooked thoroughly & wasn't bad.</text>

Great pizza... great price! But the best part... this business is located in the heart of the Mission Hills - Mesa Oaks area.

Giant Manhattan can be a little inconsistent, but when they're good, They're GOOD! Definitely the best pizza in Lompoc when they're on their game. The wings are saucy as hell and the Pepperoni pizza is Ah-Mazing!<//text>

Good, solid New York style pizza.  The crust is a little bit thick to be a true New York style but it's the best pizza in the Lompoc or Santa Maria areas - hands down.</review>

Always a pleasure to come in to see the staff at Dr. Bayette’s office.  Pam my hygienist is always pleasant, professional and does a great job.  Diane in the front office is very efficient and friendly.  They’ve all been there for years and that shows Dr. Bayette is very good to his staff and patients.
I hope to be a patient there as long as he’s there!<//Text>

<text>Dr Bayette and his team are always supremely concerned with my health and well being. There is never any unnecessary treatment just to make extra money. I have been a patient for probably 10 years. My mother and my wife also are patients. I feel like a member of the family and am always happy to see Dr Bayette, Janice, Diane, and the expert oral hygienists on staff. Due to a lifetime of neglect, my teeth and overall oral health was a difficult case. Dr Bayette charted a treatment plan that has brought me to a stable and healthy place. For a real professional dentist with the BEST chair side manner, i strongly recommend Dr Bayette.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr Bayette and his staff are outstanding in a field of their own. Their care and concern for me and my teeth are beyond compare. An office full of friendly, funny, kind, considerate, conscientious, curious, welcoming, open and flexible people is rare in our society today. It comes from the top boss and filters down through everyone working there. Oh! And they do a great job and I NEVER feel any less than a VIP patient there.</text>

During these uncertain times of COVID I had a thorough and safe experience with the hygienist during my teeth cleaning and exams.
This office has always had state of the art equipment in their office.

Dr Vaheed and his staff take the extra steps for sanitation. They are  always friendly and helpful.
I highly recommend this office for any dental needs. They are nothing but perfection!< /review>

Dr. Bayette feels like family and provides the best dental care I have ever experienced. He is kind and gentle, extremely knowledgeable and does beautiful work!
Dr. Bayette really cares about his patients and takes the time to discuss all care options before proceeding with treatment. His hygienists are also gentle, very thorough, and full of helpful, friendly advice.
I recommend Dr. Bayette highly.< /review>

My appointment was for deep cleaning. Dr  Bayette and his staff made the experience almost pleasant. I had no pain during the procedure and am having no pain afterwards. The mouthpiece they used made it so thay I have no jaw pain from holding my mouth open for so long.< /text>

Dr. Bayette is an excellent dentist and a great guy. I have been seeing Dr. Bayette for several years now and he also takes care of my entire family's dental needs. His staff are very accommodating and friendly, and Dr. Bayette goes out of his way to ensure that procedures are as pleasant and timely as possible. I have recommended Dr. Bayette to several friends and neighbors and everyone has been very pleased with his services.
If you need an honest, extremely competent dentist, Dr. Bayette is your man!< /Text>

Dr. Bayette is an expert in his field and his work is of the highest quality. He is very gentle and caring with his patients. First and foremost he has the best interest of his patients in mind, medically and financially. His office staff are all very, kind, professional and efficient. One thing that I really like about their office management is that he values his patients’ time as much as his own. I do not remember a time when I had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seen by him or his dental hygienist. Now that is efficiency!< /review>

<Review>As a former Dental Hygienist, I have always been EXTREMELY particular about the quality of dentistry I access for myself. When I first moved to San Diego about 12 years ago, I met another hygienist and, since I was new to to the area, I asked her for a referral. Dr. Bayette, was her first choice! This has been my dental office ever since! I also think it's significant that he has the same staff as when I first became a patient. They're like extended family to me now! I wouldn't switch to a different dentist if you paid me!  😁</Review><userid>108180242698280212689<//userid>< date>

Dr Bayette and his staff make going to the dentist a delightful experience. They are welcoming and warm but, most importantly, they educate me about my teeth every single time. There is a focus on preventive care; I always leave with new tips on how to prevent decay and improve my mouth hygiene. Dr Bayette is gentle and meticulous. He works in such a way that I feel very little to no discomfort. His work on my and my wife's teeth has been phenomenal. The culture at this office is a model for a well-balanced approach to patient care. I recommend Dr Bayette without any reservations.< /Review>

Dr Bayette and his entire staff are the best! I drive from Julian every 4 months to have my teeth cleaned. If I moved to the East Coast, I think I would still return to this very professional yet friendly and caring dental team. If you don't like going to the dentist, Dr Bayette would change that. He is so gentle.<//Text>

It was Friday, and I had a tooth that was trying to leave me for about 5 months. The tooth and I had an agreement, I wouldn't remove the rebellious tooth if he didn't cause me too much pain. The tooth broke the treaty and was causing me great discomfort, so I set out on a mission to find a doctor here in San Diego. Not an easy tasks, it was like finding a needle in a pile of needles. I found Dr. Bayette, and called his office, it was closed, but foolishly they gave an after hours emergency number, I called it, left a message thinking I'd better keep looking. But to my surprise within 30 min. Dr. Bayette called me personally, to understand the problem. We talked for about 20 minutes (I interviewed him), and based on our conversation I hired him to be my dentist. He called in a prescription to ensure there would be no infection and set me an appointment for Tuesday. When I arrived on Tuesday I was treated with respect and professionalism by his staff. The Office was clean, and well equipped, his staff was knowledgeable and caring. needless to say the rebellious tooth and I parted company on Tuesday, and I thank Dr. Bayette and his team for the patient care and compassion.
BOTTOM LINE______________ Dr. Bayette and his team understand and practice Great patient Care! Thank You! PS- You can keep the Rebellious Tooth.< /Text>

I can't say enough about how great this practice is!  Dr. Bayette cares about his patients.  I became a patient about five years ago and I was very impressed on my initial examination.  I have never had a dentist do a more thorough exam on my dental hygiene.
He has an amazing staff.  Pam, the hygienist, cares about your dental health so after the exam if you get a stern talking too about not flossing your teeth, you better start flossing before the next visit because she does not forget! I am so happy that they care..=)< /review>

I've been going Dr. Bayette's office for about 6 years, and I hope they never retire - I love going there. The staff is small, friendly and will get to know you by name. Dr. Bayette has a very comforting voice and he is very friendly. Janet, Alison and Diane are seriously the nicest women on the planet and care very much for their patients. I would pay cash if they didn't accept my insurance. I love them that much!</Review>

Dr. Bayette is not only the best Dentist I have ever had but definitely one of the best doctors period. I am able to put full trust in Dr. Bayette's ability to perfect my smile and he never lets me down. I have had extensive work done and each time I am always completely satisfied with the results and am impressed by Dr. B's skill. I would highly recommend Dr. Bayette's office for any of your dentistry needs, he has honed his craft and is on the top of his game!</Text>

I received a call from my daughter's school that I needed to get there right away as a boy had accidentally run into my daughters face, and now one of her brackets from her braces was lodged into her lip.On the way down I called her orthodontist, but they were closed. I picked her up and headed over to the pediatric dentist she went to before that was near the school hoping they could help.Alas they were also closed(weird as it was a Thursday)I decided to just walk next door to a dentist that I saw was open.From the moment I walked in they were so kind and sympathetic. Dr. Bayette came right over to look my daughter over. He took her back to a room.He was so sweet and calming to her.He told me our option was to numb her up and yank the bracket out(it was in there deep)I gave him the go ahead.Within minutes my daughter could open her mouth up again and was pain free.I am so thankful to Dr Bayette and his entire office.They could have sent us away because we were not patients of theirs but instead treated us like we had been going to him for years.!When it was time to leave and pay they would not let me. They would not accept a payment. I could not believe it. When does this ever happen?I would recommend Dr. Bayette to anyone looking for a dentist.Kind and professional.I will be going back to him.</text>

READ THIS!!!
This field is awesome and I've been coming back since I was 12. Its an awesome field and other players only make the experience better, the Refs are cool and as long as you call you hits and never take off your mask on the field then the experience is awesome. Photos make the field look small but trust me, its big alright. Despite other reviews of people saying the Refs are "Biased" and "Rude" they aren't, the Refs are very friendly and like to mess around but they'll never put you down, you'll always find the refs laughing and its a very friendly environment for new players! Ive been attending for years and I can promise you, If you're a person who likes to have fun and mess around this field is %100 for you!
(There is a new Ref though, he's the youngest one, he is rude though, but thats because he doesn't know how to be a ref and is still learning.)< /Text>

<Review>Love the field and the refs, but they really need to do some maintenance on the buildings and the shade structures in the parking lot.  Looking a little tired. There are buildings that are missing whole sections of wall, there are holes that that shouldn’t be there, and there are bunkers that blew down months ago that have not been replaced.

Tips for the newcomer:
1.  Bring lots of water and something to eat.  They do have water for purchase, but better to bring your own.
2.  If you own an HPA, can get air down the hill at the Paintball field.
3.  Ask questions of the ref or the regulars.  Better to ask the question than not understand the rules and not have a good time.<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Warped Ops is very good. I would recommend for all types of players. MOST of the staff is friendly and helpful with new players. The field offers decent rental guns and face protection for players who are just trying out the game. The playing area is big with a nice mix of CQB and open area.

Pros-
Big field
Great Community
Decent Rental Gear
Variety of players
Helpful Staff
Multiple fun game modes

Cons
Ground is slippery with BBs
"Roof" rules can confuse newcomers
No water **bring lots of food and water**< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Most of the regulars would hide them and cover them up just to get a cheap kill. The final ref was great tho he answered questions while the first ref was cheating in the game. Btw nate when a customer asks you a question about what tool to use for the gun dont answer with that gun is a F$@%ing piece of s@%t.

This field is great it has so many ways to tackle objectives. From high above or low. With plenty of different scenarios. Regular players are helpful to new comers. I suspect it will continue to grow. The staff is very helpful and enforce the rules to insure that all players have fun. For more insight I recommend searching for videos. Just look up video that are from 2015.<//Text>

<Review>Field and patrons are fantastic. It's a great place to airsoft. However, the staff are horrible. I don't know what their mentality is. One thing is to be strict, straight forward, and making sure the rules are being kept; then there are these guys. Honestly, some of the most unprofessional employees I have ever come across. The bald guy isn't too bad. It's the guy with the long beard. He is profane and very rude. I don't understand, how is that we're paying to play on the field and have a good time with a referee swearing and cursing at players for making mistakes. Small mistakes at that. Other than the staff, it's a nice field with good people there.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>We went to Warped Ops for the 1st time today. My son had an amazing time. The field was clean and had a good layout. There are plenty of benches and shade. The staff were very friendly and helpful and fun and engaging with the players. The sign in process was very easy and fast. The prices were really inexpensive. The staff had pizza for sale. The players were polite and friendly and very nice to the newbies and kids. Everyone contributed to having a fun experience. I will definitely take my son there again many times. 5 stars

My only recommendation is to have a porta potty on site on the airsoft parking lot. The females especially would thank u greatly👍. We don't like to commune with nature.</text>< Pics>

Played here twice, Sunday 5/18 and 5/29.
Field is great.
By far the best MilSim field I've played in SoCal.
Player conduct reasonable to really professional w/the usual group or two of a-hole younger guys/teenagers who do not call their hits.
Cost is great at $20.00.
Only real negative is the referee(s) and some of the people who work here and what appears to be a group of their friends.
Individually, all nice people.
Collectively, they hang out together during and between games and seem more interested in their internal conversations than running a good game and a solid business
On Sunday 5/29, I think they were all hung-over: short-tempered, talked among themselves constantly, and a kiss-my-ass attitude from start to finish.
First Op d/n even start until 10:40 am (they open at 9:00) and we ENDED at 3:40 pm, w/a ONE HOUR lunch break....absolutely RIDICULOUS.
If I owned Warped Ops, I'd fire all of them and hire new people.
Guys, if you do not like your job at Warped Ops, quit and go do something else.  You have A LOT of guys playing here who are old enough to be your fathers...speaking to us and treating us with some measure of respect would be helpful.  If had a late Saturday night, try some coffee and a few aspirin.
A really great place otherwise, would play here before anywhere else and do my best to overlook the employees.<//Text>

I've had the displeasure of being around one of the more unsavory and pretentious staff members there. He is a scurffy, fat, bearded, brunette shortbus who takes perverse pleasure in yelling at, scaring, and intimedating the kids and teenagers there. Fartsack is obviously a loser in real life and takes out his agressions on his customers. What a jackass.<//Review>

There's a group of regulars that play there an helped me out with a gun problem and were very kind to me even though i was on the other team. There were a few cheaters but there always are in airsoft. Also i noticed alot of people think that their guns shoot farther than they really do LOL. I had a guy talking to me during a game complaining about someone cheating but from where that guy was shooting, the enemy was over 300ft away lmao(I used google measurements). Only con is we didnt start games until 10:20. I think it would help if there was 2 refs on duty instead of one because there were around 80-90 people there that day.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<user_name>Rene Gutierrez</user_name><time>1464222003575</time><Response>None< /Response><Review>Ever since Tac-City North closed down, my best friend and I were left choosing which of the far away outdoor fields to go to. We settled on this place. I have heard some good things about it so we went.

First off, waaaaaaaay too much cursing and cussing from the referees. We are not at a bar, and I don't know them nor do they know me in that manner. In the safety speech that is given, the refs speak to the players as if they were talking to children. As having played paintball for over 20 years and a few years in airsoft, this is the first time I've heard refs with that big of a foul mouth, or disrespect.

The other thing was the HUGE waste of time between games and on lunch. No communication as to when games start or when to prep for the start of a game. Lunch time is the worst. My friend and I paid the $20 entrance fee just to play three (3) games, the whole day! Really!! The website says that they open at 9a. Which they do.At 10a they start the speech, and lasts for an hour. And finally at 11a, the first game is started. Waste of time.

The turn around of the games takes up too much time. The refs act as if they would rather be somewhere else. And with their attitudes, I wish that they were somewhere else. I went there a total of three times. Each time thinking that it would get better. But, it didn't. Just got worse. Oh well, its not like this review is going to change anything. If you wish to go, go at your own risk. Needless to say, I won't be going there anymore. Hollywood Sports Park ... here we come!</Review>< rating>

place is great. though they dont sell food other than a $20 pizza. just never wear a dye i4 there lol they'll immediately group you in with the overshooting crowd and watch you like a hawk all day. also apparently your not allowed to have a fast trigger finger lol. other than that the field was great, players were awesome. any time i had a player who didn't call his hits random people would group up an help me make him call it so that was cool.
(edit) only reason this is a 4 not a 5 is because games take a long time to start</text>

I've played at this field a fair amount so my opinion is averaged out over the course of many months.

Firstly, the field itself is fun, well laid out, with lots of brush everywhere. Though It lacks a lot of cover, as the field only has a few building, which are made of plywood. Not uncommon on an airsoft field, but when compared to SC Village, or Hollywood Sports it's lacking.

The staff is another story. They have moments of being courteous and professional, but many times I've seen them yell at players screaming profanity with many other young players present, I've seen them talk condescendingly to people asking for help, and most importantly I've seen them break the rules they stress so often. First and foremost, is the bias towards the regulars. Many times these "regulars" will join in reffing games, as well as operate the chronograph, and demonstrate bad sportsmanship without repercussions. Secondly is the lack of "reffing". They rarely solve disputes in a fair diplomatic way, if they do at all.

The players at this field is ultimately what drove me away. There is a good bunch of guys who play there by the rules, and to have a good time. Unfortunately there is a bigger group of "regulars" and others that come with chips on their shoulders, constantly complaining and treating the newer, and younger players with disrespect. They also show horrible sportsmanship, and make playing at this field frustrating. I've had players come up to me bragging about how their guns are shooting over the FPS limit, as well as cheating. Just recently I was physically attacked by another player for shooting him too closely, and I was immediately assumed to be the aggressor. That was the final straw, as my safety was jeopardized and has prompted me to write this review.

My opinion is if you're looking for a place to play airsoft in Los Angeles; FIND ANOTHER FIELD. Many first time players I've met over the year and a bit that I've played here have left dissatisfied and shocked at the lack of respect from the staff, and terrible sportsmanship of the other players. Airsoft is a sport of honor, and there's no honor in gung-ho people who treat others with disrespect from every angle at this field.< /review>

<Review>I've gone to many other Airsoft arenas here in LA or Ventura and I have to say this one isn't that bad.Its good for intermediate Airsoft players but not beginners, it's not that good for beginners ,because they might not be used to all the running . it is a very large field ,in my opinion beginners should go to Ambush, it's located in Moorpark and has multiple fields great for all players.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Awesome, field, great for all ages and skill level. This was the first field I've been to and i haven't had a better experiance anywhere else. The employees are very kind and friendly and work very hard to make sure their customers are having a blast. The referees are good. They constantly pay attention to make sure everyone is playing the game fairly and safely. However, there's sometimes scuffles between the players due to disagreements, as well as heavy swearing. The field is very safe as far as i've seen. It seems like the only true danger on the field is tripping and stuff, or being dumb enough to take off your mask/eye protection. Regardless, Warped Ops is no doubt the best airsoft field in Santa Clarita for organized, simple play.< /text>

<Review>This place is a very good field to play at, I hear that the refs curse but its fine by me, I don't mind them cursing, I even curse myself. I went there during the summer to get into airsoft and I even went to their 2nd night ops. I would have had a better experience at the night ops if my goggles didn't fog so that issue was on me. They always explain the rules, do's and don'ts, make sure to always follow the rules. Never, ever complain against the refs, because if you bring a gun that requires a 100ft minimum engagement distance and he just makes an estimate, just go with it, don't piss off the ref. I wish they could fit in at least 1 new game mode, Benghazi, king of the trenches, infected, team deathmatch, ambush, and most importantly Death Star are really fun game modes that I've played there. I'm currently getting a red dot for my SVU bullpup sniper rifle so I can make my experience playing a bit better for myself since I can't aim my iron sights because of a cheek riser. Anyways, I have fun playing at this field, I even asked a couple of guys if I could see their gun and they were also interested in seeing mine since it was rare to see a bullpup russian sniper rifle. The field has a great layout and I made multiple friends there at Warped Ops.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Ive been to warped ops around 10 times or so over the past year. The field is great, the people there are very helpful. I have one problem here though thats stopped me from coming in the past. The amount of games played. Its partially the fault of players that play that day. not getting up or loading their guns fast enough. but mostly its the refs. I like all the refs, they can be sarcastic but they mean well. i just wish we could get more games in and start earlier. even tho theyre arnt alot of people at the field by 10 i think they should still do some pick up games while we wait for more! honestly thats my only con about this place. ive met alot of nice people who seem to go their regularly. the refs keep the teams balanced and the game modes they play and amazing and pretty immersive. over i give the place a 5 star. and if your a ref or the owner at warped, can you guys try to get more games in! thanks :)< /text>

I've been to multiple fields as well as Milsim AO's. Warped Ops is probably my favorite semi-local outdoor field due to the variety of terrain (trenches, hills, small buildings), interesting game scenarios (King of the Trenches is fun), and exclusivity to airsoft (no paintball mess). I would say the field is geared for the more intermediate players as beginners may get worn out from the back-and-forth of a big field.

After reading the other reviews, it seems like staffing/reffing is the main subject of critique. I can say that the staff are strict and have zero tolerance for anyone breaking safety rules. People do get yelled at for removing eye protection on the field (Breaking rule #1). Better yelled at than losing an eye, I think. Also having a magazine in your gun in the parking lot is no good. I should know...

At the safety brief (mandatory to attend), the ref explains about what to do when someone doesn't call their hits/gets caught cheating: Try to remember the appearance of who you think is cheating and talk to the ref AFTER the round or when you yourself call "hit". They'll handle it from there! That's part of their job. Be composed. It's a game where adults shoot small plastic pellets at each other, sheesh! Please don't confront people yourself. Also please attend safety brief (it's very important!!)

In conclusion, if you're looking for an outdoor field and a chance to practice different strategies and tactics to complete objectives, and/or just have fun slinging bbs, Warped Ops is a great place to go. Never forget to bring water and hydrate often. The porta-potties are clean and maintained. The field is always growing and changing as far as buildings, terrain, quality of rentals, etc. Show up and see for yourself.<//Review>< time>

Wow... Simply wow! Ordered the burrito with the combination of pork skin and lengua. The meat on this thing was tremendously flavorful! Not too greasy. Large portions too. Probably the best burrito I've had in a while in the US.</Review>

This spot right here is the BOMB 💣 the Carnitas are to-die-for so full of flavor I found this spot by luck one of the perks of being a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Uber driver. 😎 Zamora is a Hidden treasure...</text>

We have carnitas in all of our travels so we can compare and this place kills the competition. The place is clean service is fast. The $13 a pound is sooo worth it. Make sure to get a mix of tripitas and mollejas... I love mollejas and not everyone sells these and they always have them at this place.<//Review></record>

Pretty little hole in the wall place.   Cash only.  Only serves pork dishes.  I had great tacos.  They also sell chicharonnes[pork rinds] by the pound.  A recommend if you're in the area.  Speaking Spanish is helpful but not necessary.< /Text>

Love this place. It is always nice to stop for a quick dinner. You pick your carnitas from the heat lamp, they chop it up and serve with tortillas, salsa, onions cilantro and lime. Two of us ate 6 tacos and two drinks and only spent $16 including tip. Will be back again. It is always good to call ahead of time to make sure they didn't run out of carnitas.</review>

The food is good if your looking for somewhat homemade chicharron en Chile. But the place needs a big time update there was a hole on the wall that I was afraid of.<//text>

Our burritos needed a little more seasoning for our liking. We were the only patrons and maybe that was because it was close to closing time. I won't go back.< /review>

< Review>
They're getting five stars for the food the place is small very nice decorations but I wish they had at least two more people to work with them I did go in a Saturday with my family and I guess lot of people order to go through the phone so it  did take a little bit of time for us to get our order to eat in.</Review>

Love this place! They have the best Carnitas and Chicharrones (pork rinds). The place is small but the food is delicious.</review>

<review>This was my 1st time ever to a spot like this. I tried meats I've dared not eaten in the past, boy was I missing out. The kidney and tripitas were bomb. When you to Zamoras just be willing to try something different. Youre either going love it or hate it. I expecy you'll love it like I did. The staff was very courteous. The meats very fresh. Thank you Zamora Bros.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very good taste, you choose the type of meat you want as rib, solid, chick, buche etc. You can ask for taco or pound attention is very good by the staff the cost is moderate I have not had to find the place full if it has parking facilities in general are clean.
I recommend this place to spend if you are in a hurry and if it is not a cozy place to eat right there

(Original)
Muy buen sabor, tu mismo escoges el tipo de carne que quieres como costilla, maciza, cuerito, buche etc. Puedes pedir por taco o por libra la atencion es muy  buena por parte de el personal el costo es moderado no me a tocado encontrar lleno el lugar si tiene estacionamiento   las instalaciones en general son limpias.
Recomiendo este lugar para pasar si llevas prisa y si no es un lugar acogedor para comer ahi mismo<//Text>< date>

(Translated by Google) Super friendly and attentive all the staff from the owners to the employees receive you with a big smile that makes you feel at home. The delicious 100% Michoacan-style carnitas and at their point the best carnitas restaurant in los angeles ca. I love my children and I recommend them and invite you to try

(Translated by Google) This place is the spot! Fried pork is really good. It really is the spot to get carnitas. They do parties and big orders. I order for potluck at work all the time and ppl are always asking me for the address.

Carnitas are good. Very very good They sell wholesale or by people. I always buy it here. People ask me and ask to know where I buy it. I always mean people here. The quality, price and taste is the best.

Las carnitas estas buenas. Muy muy buenas. Venden de mayoreo o por personas. Yo siempre la compro aqui. Gente me piden y piden saber donde la compro. Siempre refiero a gente aqui. La calidad, precio y sabor es de lo mejor.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The carnitas are delicious, you can eat there super delicious, the sauce they have delicious, I would like to see on my next visit that they would decorate a little more homely something like they had before, for me I gave them the 5 stars, it would be super father that They had coffee in the morning.

(Original)
Las carnitas son riquisimas, puedes comer ahí súper rico, la salsa que tienen deliciosas, me gustaría ver en mi próxima visita que volvieran a decorar un poco mas hogareño algo así como tenían antes, por mi les daba las 5 estrellas, seria súper padre que tuvieran café por las mañanas.</Text>

<text>This is a clean and well run place.  The trainers are highly qualified.  It is a bit small for my taste, as I am used to the large muscle head gyms.  But, glad I tried it and I would recommend it for someone looking for a personal and intense . Highly recomend for Jamie.
The team at GB3 North is simply awesome.   They are welcoming, encouraging and honest.  You can tell that they actually care about their clients and work hard to craft a training plan that is effective for you.  Three weeks in and I am loving it.  I would highly recommend.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMQswZqkbAliS7k0lavMT1V-VYAYyoDfWeUdsm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMci7OS8jLKBTzP-hzcpT--m2iNiDa9Iu7gVtVu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<text>This is my favorite gym out of all the GB3 is that I have been to. The faculty is very sweet and helpful. The teachers for classes are very friendly. The best time to go is really early in the when it opens at 4am. It also gets really packed at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. so I wouldn't advise going at those times because all the machines, especially shoulders, treadmill, and free weights are packed.< /text>< Pics>

I have been going to GB3 for quite awhile and I have gotten many of my friends and family to sign up for membership too, but this location makes me consider canceling my membership and going elsewhere. I suggest upper management look into this or else they will see a decline in business unless they don't care.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I've only been coming here a week, but ever since day one I've liked it. Being on the larger side I get self conscious, however the front desk staff is very nice and made me feel welcomes.

<Text>Best new gym in town, even on the busiest days, you don't wait very long for machine and there is ample parking. Biggest downside is the locker rooms were apparently designed to accommodate 5 people for a gym that can hold thousands of people, I def don't get that..< /Text>< Pics>

The temperature is too cold. There is no need to have the blowers and ceiling fans at full blast for an 8:30 am Pilates class in January!  Unfortunately management is not responsive. The front desk staff is not the friendliest.  On the plus side, the building is well kept and very clean and parking is very good.<//Review>

It took me a while to sign up for GB3, I tried Fitness Evolution, but they kept changing things like getting rid of child care and non-boot camp classes. Then I tried a boot camp place. But I still really needed child care. GB3 is the mom's place to be! They have great child care facilities stocked with awesome play areas, coloring pages and great staff.
Most of the classes they offer are great! I love that they have so many different types of classes to choose from.< /text>

<time>1531255360528< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This GB3 has employees walking around organizing the free weight area and making sure the whole area is clean and well organized. This is very much appreciated! It is well worth the extra 15 minute drive to and from this location for the better gym experience in comparison to the other GB3 gyms. It has 4 squat racks, plenty of flat/incline benches, and also lots of adjustable benches near the dumbbell area.

Thank You!< /Review>< pictures>

<name>Vanessa<//name><review>I’ve been attending GB3 for a few months now. I’ve liked it so far but I had an event happen to me on August 31st, that really has me upset. The gym is beautiful and we’ll maintained but I had the manager of the Gym TOUCH ME in the middle of a deadlift set. First, a man didn’t address himself as Gym staff, just felt it was okay to cause a safety hazard. I emailed the Gym and I received a flat response and no solution. I like the gym because it’s close to my house. No one should be allowed to touch a gym goer without permission especially in the middle of a set!</review>< userid>

I’ve been a member for almost 20 yrs and my 12yr old son wants to go to the Gym with me.I figure since it’s his first time I’ll get him a guest pass WRONG they were going to charge him $10 for a one time fee. Then I decided to put him on our family plan that come to find out I’ve been over paying for years. They won’t even waive the $199 member fee even though I’ve over paid over $1000 come on GB3 think about your customers. Loyalty means nothing here!< /review>

Daniel at the front desk acted like a complete moron when confronted about a situation regarding my family member’s gym membership. Daniel clearly does not possess the mental capacity required to deal with customers.<//Review>

<Review>So big, so many people, so new. It's a new gb3 in Fresno which means it will be filled with members -- new and old. And it's January (at time of writing this) which means new year new me crowd also in full effect. But it's well sized enough to handle most of the crowd and still be able to get a good workout in. 6 squat racks! Finally about time I have a shot to have a good leg day without waiting forever. Pool, sauna, clean brand new bathrooms and brand new machines everywhere. Looking for a place that has EVERYTHING you need... Join in.</Review>< pictures>

This gym by far is the best in Fresno and by that I mean it is filled with amazing equipment  and lots of space but be prepared to be surrounded by snobs this includes the staff.  Rather spend my money at Fort Washington where their staff is attentive and well mannered.< /Text>

Was really looking forward to doing spin class at this location. Talked with a gentleman who sold us our membership, saying they would have spin, and they recently moved all their bikes to another location. It's a decent gym for sure, but just disappointed we thought they were going to have spin, and got rid of it so soon.</Text>

<text>Wish I would of read the reviews before signing up and paying up front for a three year contract. We had to deal with that imbecile of a manager with little man syndrome who obviously has no business in customer service. What a disappointment of someone who's in 'charge' because he lacks people skills, communication skills, and just being a good human being and acting like he has some sense skills. If I could do it again I would I signed up at a different location even if I had to pay more money as long as I didn't have to look at that poor excuse of a human every time I go in there. He was extremely disrespectful, condescending, arrogant and just plain rude when we brought our 12 & 14 year old to the gym on a weekend to swim as we did in the past with no problem but then wanted to charge them adult pricing with no better solution or way of resolving a very simple situation. Instead wants to make a scene and becomes confrontational in front of everyone and only backed up because we advised him we had corporate on the line. Smh what a lame. Oh well. We'll finish our time out and then go somewhere else. Hope this helps someone cause it would of saved me a headache.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

Rude desk staff yelled at me for it checking in before putting my kids in daycare.

"SIR YOU HAVE TO CHECK IN AT THE DESK BEFORE YOUSIGN YOUR KIDS IN DAYCARE!"

<review>Equipment is par, Sean the manager would be better off running a Curves.  Claims I’m the only one with a problem with him. After checking reviews of gyms he’s previously managed, it’s evidently not just me that considers him rude and arrogant.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Worst customer interaction to date!!! About three years ago I switched from Fort Washington Gym Fitness to GB3 because of their customer service. Today I was treated like garbage.

First I walked into the gym and gave my number. After that, they stopped my brother who is under the same membership and asked us questions. They asked me for my birthday to verify that I'm not trying to sneak in a freebie as someone else I guess. I told them that they already took my picture 6 months ago, but they said the pictures did not transfer from the Cedar & Nees branch. The way Sean was talking to me was so disrespectful that I asked, "Why are you talking to me like that?" Sean the general manager ignored me and went to talk to other gym members.

Jen approached us because my brother forgot to take his picture and I talked to her briefly for about 5 mins. She was very nice and understood how customer interaction works. She even apologized to me when she didn't even do anything. I felt a little better about it & understood this is a new gym and they have many individuals who may be trying to get a workout in without a membership. However, there is an obvious way to talk to your members, which Sean the general manager has no idea about.

After finishing my workout, I figured let me talk to this guy who was so rude to me and understand why I was treated that way. I'm a Director of Underwriting and I deal with clients on a daily basis, so I'm accustomed to defusing a situation and talking about it. After a long day at work from 9-5 I'm obviously a little irritated that I was treated that way. It turns out Sean is the general manager and again he was rude in his approach. He kept telling me these are gym procedures and everyone has to go through them (all in just a rude tone still). Really?!? My birthday? The year? Do you also want my social security number to make sure I'm a legal resident and this is me?

Anyways, Sean obviously absolutely did not want to apologize & was extremely rude once again. He kept telling me these are gym procedures and every time I come in all I have to do is give them my number wait for my picture to come up and "they will let me enjoy my workout". The least he could have done was apologize or say something along the lines of, "I understand where you're coming from." These are just some basics of customer interaction.

I'm usually a very respectful guy and treat people with respect and get the same in return, which is why I was irritated and bothered. Sean should definitely not be a general manager unless he takes some training courses in customer interaction. I really hoped to run into George Brown because I've seen him at the gym a couple of times, but he was not there. I hope he gets a chance to read this review. I have no idea how Jen & Sean could be working at the same place and Sean is the one that is the general manager. Jen should definitely be the one in charge based on how they both handled this very simple situation.

Don't get me wrong by the way, this gym is definitely the best one in Fresno & you will not find better machines or a better environment to work out at. The people that go there are all very nice and friendly. If I rated this yesterday, then it would have gotten 5 stars.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Gym is great but when I went up to one of the managers where you sign up for memberships I went in to ask him a simple question if I could switch my bang for a colder one because I got a warm one and he was so rude about me getting one, he raised his voice and made me dislike coming to one of my favorite locations.</text>

<review>This gym is horrible what happened to all the staff from Cedar & Nees. Checking in now is similar to a interrogation, worst than a TSA screening and the manager Sean needs to take a class in customer service as he is not fit for the job of managing this gym. Also this location was advertised for a over a year before opening that it would be a 24/7 location but now Mr.Brown decides to be cheap and not want to pay for staff to stay over night. Overall this gym chain is horrible and hope maybe one day 24 Hour Fitness will come into the Fresno area and save us from this chain of subpar gyms.</review><Name>Mike Sanders<//Name><date>1515386115893< /date>< Rating>

< review>
I absolutely love GB3. I generally go to the fowler & herndon location, everyone is great there. I was very excited about the new gym and have gone a couple of times and had great experiences at first; new, clean, big. but tonight I decided to deadlift.. and sean, the manager, approached me because I was “slamming my weights”. I told him that i was deadlifting and it is impossible to be any more quiet with the weights than i already was. He presumed to tell me it was “easy” and that i “should be setting down the weight as quietly as i picked it up”. I couldn’t help but laugh, is this planet fitness? because last i checked, the sound of controlling a negative while deadlifting, and slamming weights is completely different.
you won’t catch me back at this location until he’s gone (which i presume will be sooner than later, as I am not the first & certainly not going to be the last person that complains about sean and his disrespectfulness), but i will gladly continue to go to all other locations with kind employees :) but all in all, i love gb3!<//review>

Everything was so good! As we arrived the staff was already setting up our table with appetizers and from that moment on food just kept arriving. Large amounts and full of flavors! Everything was great and everyone was so happy. Lora was really great and the service in general was pleasant and fast. We will definitely visit again.<//text>

We have been here numerous times - for my birthday, friends and family birthdays, my nephews 1st birthday, a wedding reception, and many other events. Every time we had a fantastic experience dealing with Fanya and Lora. They are very accommodating, always making sure everyone is satisfied. They are also very pleasant and sweet.

Looking forward to our next party here!</text>< user_name>

Food, entertainment was great, the only part that I hate is the smoking area. It's inside, behind restaurant doors and the ventilation is really bad or they don't have one at all, so the restaurant stinks of smoke as well. For someone who doesn't smoke its really disgusting.< /Review>

<Review>Hello,
I'm an event planner and work with Maxim for the last several years.
Fania and her partner are an amazing sweet ladies who always take care of the client and satisfy every one. very professional staff and kind people.
Their food is the best, they offer a large selection and their band entertainment is feonominal.
If you are looking for a place to do your next event, I definitely recommend you to consider Maxim.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2becce8bf0fbd:0x7312360b3af15c13</gmapID></record>

Celebrated my mom's birthday some time ago. Our table had about 12 people. Set menu, agreed on the price, I think it was $100/person. At the end of the night, the time to settle the bill comes, the owner (older woman) decides to add a 20% tip to the bill. That is not something that is done when there is a set price per person for the banquet. No other Russian restaurant does that. Very dishonest owner, would not come back to this place again.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Good service. The musicians are great, it was not boring. I especially want to note, cook deliciously. Thanks a lot to the twists. A cute Asian girl who served food alone is also great. Thanks Maxim.

Хорошее обслуживание. Музыканты молодцы, было не скучно. Особо хочу отметить, готовите вкусно. Поворам большое спасибо. Милая девочка азиатской внешностью , которая подавала на стол еду одна, тоже молодец. Спасибо Maxim.< /Review>

They have the best California salad mix!! And the fish and chips were so filling. Three nice size of good tasting fish. Glad I tried a different location I'm in love with their shrimp salad 💣<//review>

Since it's always so busy and packed, I recommend ordering online. It's the quickest way to order without having to wait in person or on the phone.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I had the swai and salmon. All of the food is very flavorful and the portion sizes are perfect. The beans were excellent and I loved the seasoning. I placed an order online and it was ready just on time in only about 15 minutes, even though they appeared to be pretty busy. The only downside to my whole experience would be that the fries were soggy because they put them in the same box with my fish, so I plan to ask for them in a separate box next time. I'll definitely be back!< /review>< Name>

Change is very key to making it in the food Business.  I had stopped going until the other night I went on a last minuet thing.  Oh my God they changed but also lnproved the menu.  My wife was happy my adult child was very happy and I was on hit.  I arrived @ 9:55 and was treated like the first customer of the day.  I had a rookie server who was assited by staff (cleaning). No rush Job no time clock watching.  You got my money and smiles.<//review>

Nice place.  Lots of options.  Good prices.  Most items we got needed a bit of salt, not a big deal, easy to add.  The char on the fish from the grill was nice.</Review>

Food is great. But. The online order doesn't work, so it's a wait of 20-30 minutes to order dinner on the phone. They don't have a handle on their backlog. We waited an extra 10 minutes beyond the quoted time to pick up our food. But, it was worth it!<//text>

<review>For the amount of food that was served was totally overpriced. I would personally not go there for my own personal dining experience do to that very factor. The facility was clean, well staffed and the service was prompt during the high volume of calls and walk-in orders that were being prepared.</review>< pictures>

Every time I go here the food does not disappoint. I always get the dynamite shrimp, either the tacos or the bowl and it taste so dang good!

I’m actually surprised by the amount of shrimp in the bowl. It’s a balanced amount with rice! Imo. Fair! Very good. Would def recommend.<//Review>

<text>I've now experienced for the 3rd time from the Gardena Calif Fish Grille, no sauce for my salmon.  For some reason, they always seem to forget putting in my sauce.  This is so frustrating when you wait 45 minutes for it to be delivered and the sauce is missing.  Never ordering from there again. Lack of attention to detail.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b561761fc3c9:0xc12661c66b4649dc</gmapID></record>

Branzino cooked perfectly.Its has a mild not strong fish flavor, tender and flakey.Fish portions are of good size and prices much better the traditional seafood restaurants. Walk in order took @15 minutes on a very busy Sunday lunch time. The crew member brought the order to the car and thanked me for waiting.<//review>

Food was great. Asked for salsa twice. They said they put it in the bag. Of course had to go back. It's in the details. And so basic when it's a staple to the product.< /Text>

During covid I would recommend calling in or placing your order online.   The food is good and they offer healthier options, so it's always going to be crowded for a walk in.< /text>

Ordered food to cashier.  Disappointed they did not ask if needed condiments so ended up no sauce for my fries. Too much smokes in the restaurant your hairs and you body will smell like BBQ. Fresh fish and reason portion.< /review>

< Review>
California Fish Grill is a nice departure from the "burger & fries" fast food scene. Delicious, healthy food, cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of seasoning. Makes for a surprisingly good meal. Service is great. The dining room is clean. And the atmosphere is relaxed. So if you've been wondering about this place...wonder no more. It's worth the visit.< /Review>

Ordered six meals for office lunch.  Most were uneatable and were thrown away.  I have hungry employees and have to go somewhere else to get lunch, again.  Uncooked rice and fish, bad vegetables, no taste.  Kept having to add salt, lemon and our own sauce to give it some taste.  Why don't you just provide the raw food and we cook it ourselves.  I'm sure we can do a better job.  Nasty...</text>

One of the best fish grill chains. This location is always packed but the wait is never too long. The menu offers a lot of different options. The brussel sprouts and dynamite fries are my favorite side items and will pair well with any fish choice you prefer. They also have a great great craft soda machine which offers some unique soda variations. This place should be a regular go to spot for everyone, the chain has a presence throughout Southern California, so there should be one near you.< /text>

< Review>
I'm pretty sad today.  Normally this place does well.. today was not so great.  I got the seared ahi tuna with slaw and fries. The fries were like rubber.... which is pretty close to the ahi. On the menu it says seared (rare) ... and as you can see from the pics it looks about as rare as a piece of charcoal.

I will not be going back any longer.  Maybe if they get a chef that understands what rare means.< /Review>

< Review>
Haven't had a bad experience yet! Food is always hot & cooked perfectly, if I pick it up or deliver! Didn't give it 5 stars because the quantity of food has fluctuated each time I've gone as well as the amount of garlic butter on the salmon. So now, I order extra garlic butter, but the quantity of the side orders still fluctuates - sometimes greatly.<//Review>

California Fish Grill never disappoints. The food choices are great and everything is prepared fresh and free of excess grease. Prices are affordable and the portions are hearty. I always have leftovers to take with me. Everything I've had has been delicious. Wish that there were more locations in the Inglewood and South L.A. area.  See for yourself!</review>

I used to love this place but have changed my mind. I recently placed an order online and when I went to pick up my order I was discouraged by the taste and appearance.  I ordered 2 battered fish tacos. There was barely any cabbage or sauce. Also 1 taco had a very small piece of over battered fish. It turned out to be shrimp. The tacos were also cold. I tried calling but no one picked up the phone. I was on hold for over 5 mins.< /Text>

I ordered the Cajun salmon taco combo, and it was so good! My parents got the Cajun shrimp and battered shrimp taco combo, and they both liked it as well. We ordered a side of chips also, but it tasted kind of bitter although it was crunchy. I also didn't like the salsas that much. Wish there was pico de gallo available.<//Text>

<Name>Koko S< /Name><Review>Terrible customer service and organization
Made a phone order, waited 40 min while people came in and ordered and got their food before me.  I was told to wait outside after I paid and they said they would bring it out.   Kept waiting, nobody ever came out, went back inside and my food was sitting on the counter, cold.  No apologies or anything.  Wasted my time and got cold food on top of that.  Won't be going to this fish grill again.  Work on your organization and customer service please.  I wasnt the only frustrated customer<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b561761fc3c9:0xc12661c66b4649dc<//Gmap_id></record>

<rate>5</rate><review>Okay, I’ve hated seafood forever and decided it was finally time to grow up and try something new. I got the Alaskan salmon with a double side of the green salad- dressing on the side. I eat keto so it was nice to be able to sub out the carb heavy sides- but the upcharge for the salad was a tab bit obnoxious. Might as well just skip the sides next time. But the fish was tasty, might have been the butter sauce... either way I’d come back. The woman who took my order was super friendly even in the lunch rush- always appreciate that!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF5CBuvBUQUCnaUKn_NOhYcWOEI0ahzHWaIxdG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

The Service: Order at the counter. Very popular spot in this plaza. Might have a line waiting.

The Food: Very generous portion. My favorite is fish & chips. 3 big pieces of fish, very crunchy outside, not super thick batter. Lots of fries. Just $8.98!!

The Parking: Plaza parking. Might be challenging during dinner time. Many restaurants in the same plaza.< /Review>

Worse place to eat ! Unlike other locations like OC ! Last location I went was in  El-Segundo food & service was perfect. I even wanted to go back today but I was in the area running some stuff so I decided to eat in this location. When I walked in there was some line it's OK but no air to breath !  the circulation system is bad , but when the cashier asked me about my order told her that I want the white fish I need Julie to come with two sides  I asked for call slaw and zucchini , so she said they are out of zucchini, I chose to have garlic fries instead and wanted to add salad. She asked me what kind of dressing so I told her Italian! she said they don't have it but she offered me other heavy sides which I cannot eat ! When my order was ready I pick it up in a small tray unlike the one I had at the El-Segundo location which was way bigger ! But the portion is too small here!! My french fries where little & soggy! Even the coleslaw portion was little. My fish wasn't grilled very well too. I did not enjoy that much and I wasted my money .
so my advice to people don't go to this location at all.< /text>

Love their food no complaints about it but just had a bad experience and I feel it wasnt handled properly. I got off work in Torrance and stop by California fish Grill on my way home which is in south LA...I get my food and make it home only to find that both orders I had were undercooked and raw. I spent about $24 on this meal so I have to drive back to Gardena and they make me wait in line when I told the guy about my issue. When speaking to the manager he was polite and all but i feel there was no compensation for my troubles...all he offered was to re-make the order. I'm not out for free food and I'm not going to demand anything..but it's common courtesy to at least offer something for the trouble. I just got my money back instead and left.< /Review>

Took 20 minutes to get my food, and even then I had to go in and ask about it. It was sitting on the counter ready and unbagged. Salmon taco was cold by the time I got home half a mile down the street.</review>

<user_name>Swathi Shetty< /user_name><review>Fresh and amazing quantity of food. Love all the shrimp options here. Also definitely taste their tartar sauce. It generally goes well with all their dishes.
This is usual place to lunch with my colleagues. We get out with a fresh feeling rather than getting drowsy after our lunch. This place always finds a crowd so be ready to wait for a while before you get to place your order.<//review><pics>None<//pics><rate>4< /rate><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Good food, quick, but ordering takes too long. There are not enough cashiers taking orders. Food was very good. I usually get the california bowls, make it a grain bowl for extra dollar. Dynamite fries are delicious.<//review>

Fast, decently healthy meals. Although if you want fried, you got it! Love the fish nuggets (I believe they made an appetizer out of left over fish-bits, but WHATEVER! I love 'em! Also love the giant shrimp. If you wanna be super healthy, you can get the grilled salmon, ask to leave the sauces off and douse it with lemon from the condiment bar. Oh...and they have liqour.</review>

<review>The food was better than I had expected! I loved Dynamite fries, corn, and grilled swordfish.  I didn't like how my portions were smaller when I ordered to go. My friend ordered to eat in and their portions were so much bigger.  They also just threw everything in the box. They need a to go box with separate sections for the fries and sauce, etc. For the price, good food, and decent service, relatively clean space I give it 3 stars.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2b561761fc3c9:0xc12661c66b4649dc< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

It was okay, it used to be better. It looks like things are changing, they're being a little more diverse with their staff they've changed their sauces and it looks like they're attracting a different clientele. The food portions are smaller and a little different from before, I used to love their french fries because they had this green stuff on them and they were so tasty. This time when I had them they were good but they were not the same.<//text>

Different prices than others... charging for dynamite sauce, changing shrimp skewer price based on plates,... staff not as friendly either. No smiles or anything.  Broken ketchup pump. Reallllly slow...  we ordered to go. Only 5 minutes away... battered fish and chips was spongy and greasy. Grilled catfish was overcooked and rubbery and our shrimp skewers were burnt. Not a single person enjoyed their food which is a first.  Will never go back to this location. Disappointed doesn't even describe it. If we had never gone to any other location, this would have ruined our experience of this great restaurant chain. Just sub-standard compared with other locations< /Review>< Pics>

I'm a regular customer here but today I noticed the staff were more friendly and the food was prepared to perfection. Not sure if they had a change of management or if they just improved the service.< /text>

One of my favorite grilled fish spots. Sometimes the fish is under seasoned and the fries aren't fresh out but overall everything is pretty good.< /review>

<Review>This is a favorite restaurant of mine. I usually visit them during lunchtime. Probably not the best time to come here because it gets super busy. Which also tells you that they are not half bad. The food is delicious. Their menu has mostly seafood items like fish. Their portions are good size. They even stepped it up by having a gourmet soda machine. I'm not really big on it but it's different and pretty good. The biggest concern for me was the lack of seats and tables to dine in. It gets crowded sometimes too crowded for me to stay and order. But I do give it 4 stars for everything else.</Review>< gmap_id>

I wish they'd open these up all over Los Angeles. The quality, selection, and options are all unusually good for a fast-casual restaurant. I love their fish tacos, calamari sticks, sauce and salsa bar, and soda selection! Their focus on sustainable fish choices is admirable too.< /Review>

They've change their menu since I last visited. No longer serve coleslaw which was quite tasty to replace with kale salad which sucks. My favorite was the beer battered fish n shrimp taco but they changed that too. It's okay but I prefer the original recipe with coleslaw. All I can say is "if it broke don't fix it! Overall it's pretty good just not as good as before the changes.< /review>

I'm not big on kale but it's really good for you. This place has the greatest kale slaw. It's just delicious and so very inexpensive for a side of it!!! Their grilled zucchini is also fantastic. Everything served here is amazing. They have fish tacos that are out of this world and their fried fish will not disappoint. After eating fried fish from here, I won't go anywhere else.
I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.<//text>

<Review>Delicious and healthy.. if you want it to be. I ordered the grilled rainbow trout with sides of their delicious kaleslaw ( don't be put off by the kale) and grilled zucchini. The husband was indulgent with the fish and chips. Both dishes were perfectly cooked. You get a choice of sauces and presentation, as well, so feel free to toss your fish in a rice bowl.  Very reasonable prices and beer and wine are available. Very yummy food.<//Review>< Pics>

The food is moderately priced and tastes good. The fish is cook to order, so you'll have to be patient. I personally don't mind waiting for fresh food. I usually go at lunch and there is always a long line. I suggest that you call your order in for pick up if you have a limited amount of time.<//text>

<Text>Soooo good! You can have your fish grilled or fried. The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the salads are wonderful. The food makes you feel energized because it's so fresh. You will definitely leave with an energy boost.

Food was very tasty and came out pretty fast. Salmon was cooked well and the sides were tasty. Got the kaleslaw and the fire street corn. My fiance's dynamite fries were yummy too. Bought a $2 rice Krispy that was stale. That was the only disappointing thing.</text>

<review>I usually love CFG. I've been to multiple locations but this one was not my favorite to say the least. Fries tasted like they were made and then left out for hours only to be rewarmed by the food placed on top. All the drinks were either too syrupy or watered down. And the list goes on...<//review>< Pictures>

Really good! Went of a Friday during lunch time. Got my food fairly quickly. Did have to wait for a table tho. However we did get one as soon as our food was ready. You just have to hover, people will get the hint eventually.<//Text>

He got two good sized pieces of fish I got one smallish piece, when I complained they said it was the same amount (weight) just his was thinner mine was thicker (I checked and call BS on that).  But food taste is very good, service is hit or miss, cola selections are wierd but they have regular pepsi...  I love the rice and beans too.</text></record>

Great Fresh grilled fish and Seafood that is served on a bed of your choice of White,or Brown rice that is cooked just right. Rice should be cooked the to the Italian standard of Al Dente firm but tender and they get the rice just right. The Fish is always supper fresh and you can choose from five or six selections on a daily basis broiled with Garlic butter and or Cajun Butter spice..WOW. I also love the broiled zucchini and fresh bread that is included in the meal. You can't beat the quality and price.</text>

Food is great but the order was not right and so was at least three other customers that i had witness while waiting for my order to be corrected. Also did not appreciate the fact that the short gentleman. Not sure if he was the manager for the shift wanted me to take the order that was not right< /Review>

A great place to come and get a healthy and fast fish dish. Portions are on the larger side and you can get it Cajun style which is always a plus in my book. They have a cool urban decor theme going on, but there is limited seating. They are situated in a really busy parking lot but there are plenty of spots.<//Text>

It's a nice place with good good options and catered towards seafood. It's got a couple of chicken options as well but I'd recommend the dynamite shrimp :) .. It's a bit on the mid range price for food (~$15/meal) and the only downside is the long wait times :/< /Text>

Never knew this place existed, Had a chance to go for lunch there. They got a good menu for fish combos, I tried Salmon amd Swai combo with beans and fries. No doubt that was delicious and on top of that their Stubborn Soda is cherry on the cake. I would love to go there again and try other combos. Must try place guys!!</text>

<Review>I called in an order at 1:57pm on Sat, 3/16/19. I was on hold over 20 mins. When I arrived at the restaurant, I waited in line for approx 10min while still on hold and no one answered. When I placed the order, ask ask to speak with the manager, he stated that his name was Ramon and explained that I was on hold 30 mins. He began to explain how busy they were. I explained that he should not offer a service if he can’t deliver. He just walked away as if it wasn’t a big deal. When I stride to explain to the cashier, Ana, that they are providing poor customer service, and she lifted her should as if she didn’t care. I explained that I realize there are a lot of customer now but I have seen booming businesses go out of business due to poor customer service. I have been supporting the Gardena location for over 10 years (since it’s doors open), and this will be my last visit. Ramon nor Ana did anything to make me feel that the appreciate my business. An apology would have been the first step versus telling me a million reasons why I was placed on hold over 20 minutes.</Review><rating>1<//rating><date>1552772030211<//date>< userid>

We decided to revisit after so many years and it didn't disappoint us especially we have visitors from out of time. Both the fish and chicken dishes are great and portions are good. The look of the place did improve.<//Text>

Great Fresh grilled fish and Seafood that is served on a bed of your choice of White,or Brown rice that is cooked just right. Rice should be cooked the to the Italian standard of Al Dente firm but tender and they get the rice just right. The Fish is always supper fresh and you can choose from five or six selections on a daily basis broiled with Garlic butter and or Cajun Butter spice..WOW. I also love the broiled zucchini and fresh bread that is included in the meal. You can't beat the quality and price.</review>

Omg where do I start about this place. I love this place so much. If you're looking for some healthier food options on your lunch break or for your dinner option 's this is the place. They have a kids menu for the kids 5 or less depending on what they want. And it's a not a bad amount of food. If you're trying to have a portion controlled meal you can get this kids meal and leave feeling very satisfied. The food taste great and you definitely get a good amount of food for a very low price. It is a clean and friendly environment and you can order your food over the phone ad just come in to pick it up without the wait.< /Text>

<Text>This place is great!  Convenient location near major freeway intersections, always busy during lunch (which is a good sign), and all the food is made fresh.  If the brown rice and grilled zucchini isn't a healthy enough option for you, try getting your fish over a salad instead.  The salad is colorful with dark green lettuce and a mix of nuts, dried berries and feta cheese.  Only downsides are that the tables could be a bit cleaner and there's no place to wait for your order without being in somebody's way (unless you manage to find a seat).<//Text>< pictures>

Fast, courteous, hardworking, efficient help. Always clean. Been customer about 8-10 yrs. Never disappointed. Fish always perfection--grilled fish, that is. (Had their fried fish only about 4-5 times; it was just ok). Highly recommend CFG.< /Review>

I've eaten here a few times. It's very good "fast food". I liked the fried fish and the fish tacos. I usually get 2 meals out of the fish dinner.</text>

Best white fish plate in town. Prices are not so expensive you have to give up eating healthy seafood and fish.

Placed an online order with first and last name under my moms name. She went in and they gave her a phone in order with the same first name and had to pay for it. I called and spoke to a manager who was rude and tried to put the blame on my mother for not specifying it was an online order. She gave her first and last name and was still given the wrong order. Very upset that the manager tried to put the blame on her instead of taking responsibility for the mistake. Other managers at other locations have always been accommodating when a mistake has been made.<//text>

It's a popular place but even when it's busy, you get really good service at good prices. The grilled zucchini is my favorite side.<//Review>< pics>

Great and fresh sea food grilled right in front of you. The only reason for the 4 stars is the long lines and long wait for the food.< /text>

<text>Quickie:
+ If you love fish, you need to eat here
+ White fish plate, garlic butter, white rice (all day, son)
+ CALL AHEAD TO ORDER AND AVOID THE WAIT
+ If you get it to go, make sure to grab utensils (not included in your bag)

---

Food:
First timers, try:
- White fish plate with garlic butter (comes with coleslaw and bread)
- Spicy corn chowder (large size you can share between two people)

The dishes I've listed above are my faves. I eat probably too much of that... probably need to cut back on my fish consumption for a while. But the garlic butter is so good, I can't not get it... I know I should try something different but I know I love the white fish plate, so I stand behind it. I have tried the salmon and tilapia plates along with the grilled zucchini side and fish tacos too and they also taste yummy. But the white fish is my go-to.

Service:
This place is usually always crackin', especially at lunch time. Do yourself a huge favor and call in and place an order. Takes about 10-15 minutes then go to the second line that says "Pick Up Orders," avoid the huge line that stretches to the door. If you do walk-in and order, it can take up to 10 minutes to get your food if it's mega-packed. Just be forewarned...

Location:
The lot it's located in is jam-packed with other businesses so the parking can get hectic. I usually park as close to the entrance as possible so I can get out of there easier.

Verdict:
Great food, reasonable prices (about $8-$12 per plate) and good portion sizes. Very tasty menu and good selection. I'll be a regular for many years to come...<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b561761fc3c9:0xc12661c66b4649dc<//gmap_id></record>

I had a taste for fried fish and shrimp on Saturday (10/28). A friend recommended CFG. I looked up the restaurant and reviews and everything looked pretty good. I made my order, grabbed my food, and went home to enjoy. I had a few bites of fish, shrimp, and fries, but I was unable to finish my food. Within 6 hours, I felt awful. Fever, chills, and vomiting. I went to the hospital on Sunday afternoon and was diagnosed with food poisoning. All of this for beer battered fish. Hopefully I can receive a full refund.<//text>

< Review>
Seafood get in mah belly!

PARKING: Shared lot - it gets pretty crazy as there's a ton of restaurants in this plaza (including Curry House!)

FOOD: There's a great selection of fried and grilled seafood that's, best of all, fresh.
-Fried zucchini: The breading on this kind of falls off when you by the time you receive it.
-Salmon: Cajun style is my personal favorite, but you can also go for their house garlic butter. If you're looking for something lighter, you can also get vegetables as your side!

OTHER:
-Love their salsa bar! Salsa is a great way to break up your meal with a refreshing bite. You'll need it because CFG portions are huge!<//Review>

+ If you love fish, you need to eat here
+ White fish plate, garlic butter, white rice (all day, son)
+ CALL AHEAD TO ORDER AND AVOID THE WAIT
+ If you get it to go, make sure to grab utensils (not included in your bag)

---

Food:
First timers, try:
- White fish plate with garlic butter (comes with coleslaw and bread)
- Spicy corn chowder (large size you can share between two people)

The dishes I've listed above are my faves. I eat probably too much of that... probably need to cut back on my fish consumption for a while. But the garlic butter is so good, I can't not get it... I know I should try something different but I know I love the white fish plate, so I stand behind it. I have tried the salmon and tilapia plates along with the grilled zucchini side and fish tacos too and they also taste yummy. But the white fish is my go-to.

Service:
This place is usually always crackin', especially at lunch time. Do yourself a huge favor and call in and place an order. Takes about 10-15 minutes then go to the second line that says "Pick Up Orders," avoid the huge line that stretches to the door. If you do walk-in and order, it can take up to 10 minutes to get your food if it's mega-packed. Just be forewarned...

Location:
The lot it's located in is jam-packed with other businesses so the parking can get hectic. I usually park as close to the entrance as possible so I can get out of there easier.

Verdict:
Great food, reasonable prices (about $8-$12 per plate) and good portion sizes. Very tasty menu and good selection. I'll be a regular for many years to come...< /text>< pics>

The food is great the customer service on the other hand needs to be improved. I called and the phone went through a continous loop of the automated system. Waited on the phone for 15 minutes before I was even able to speak to anybody to place an order. This is unacceptable.<//review>

So far the best place for a healthy grilled fish in Gardena. I like non farmed fish, not  a lot of choices for now, but I hope they will "catch" on and offer more wild caught fish (sorry I'm little bit of a health conscious nut). Price totally fair for what you get. Clean and simple.</Text>

<text>Omg, ppl!!  Thus place is the aTOMIC BOMB!!  The food is just....QUALITY!!  This place is always getting attention. They just don't miss a beat with their quality and deliciousness!! I've ordered their Atlantic Salmon ( cajun style sauce) w/white rice, grilled zucchini, parmesan green beans, and tacos.  Prices are quite reasonable. Give them a visit, yall.

<review>This place never fails to short our orders. May it be a phone order or an oonline order.
Last time we were missing our fish taco. Today our order is missing the salad and the dressing.
I have the cajun salmon but nooo salad.
Food here taste great but service is slow and sloppy.😒😒< /review><response>None<//response><userid>117514037368092904767<//userid></record></dataset><record>

I used to love this place. Now there is long lines, not enough cashiers and a lot of employees turn over.
First they increased the price of the salmon, now with the higher price you get a smaller portion and not the same quality as before.< /Text>

<Text>First time that we ordered for an office of about ten people....not one order correct...made them read back the order n the lady read back everything correct but when we got the food tacos were missing, other food items missing,  an order was missing, another co worker ordered a shrimp burrito wrap and got a plate with a tortilla and a side of rice not one shrimp to be found!

First time that we ordered for an office of about ten people....not one order correct...made them read back the order n the lady read back everything correct but when we got the food tacos were missing, other food items missing,  an order was missing, another co worker ordered a shrimp burrito wrap and got a plate with a tortilla and a side of rice not one shrimp to be found! Like i said not one order was right! Parking was horrible as well.  To top it off they short changed us 20 dollars in change....NEVER coming here again!<//review>

I've tired the swai with brown rice (50 cent extra for brown rice), coleslaw and a side of corn chowder. The corn chowder and coleslaw was ok. I really enjoyed the swai fish. It is very moist and light.  Not sure what the white sauce they put over it but it was so good!

Great price quality food.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Such a nice place to have lunch. Most seafood places in SJ are more catered for dinner, but I like that this place caters towards lunch time. The seafood seems super fresh and they have an extensive menu so you have so many choices. I got the ahi tuna, my only complaint is that it was not rare or med-rare at all. it was well done so the texture was way off but the flavor was good! I got it with brussel sprouts and zucchini..the sprouts were ok. i didn't like the vinagrette they put on it. I really want to come back to try their other dishes, plus the prices are super reasonable for seafood!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The food here is great, it can get crowded so anticipate a wait, but the wait is worth it.</Text>

First time visitor . . . certainly will be back.  Tired of taking Mom to P.F. Chang every time I visit L.A.  This joint is a short drive from her place.  Pretty simple; a limited menu, featuring various popular types of seafood, fried or grilled, with your choice of garlic butter sauce or cajun seasonings.  Add a choice of sides . . . brown or white rice, cole slaw, fries (sweet or regular potatoes).  I had the cajun salmon dinner, which featured 2 generous fillets.  Mom had the jumbo shrimp, with garlic butter sauce, which probably undid all the healthy choices she's made over the last couple months to drop almost 20 lbs.  Super delicious, though; both entrees.  If you'd rather go the baja route, a la Baja Fresh or Wahoo's, they do the fish taco/burrito thing too.  Their salsas taste really good

The atmosphere is big, casual and noisy . . . the restaurant interior kinda reminds one of a Chipotle store.  You order from the counter and have a seat.  You get your dish(es) very quickly after paying.  The best part of the experience, though?  $33 out the door, and that's only because Mom ordered the most expensive thing on the menu!

Good food, done fast, and pretty cheap.  Doesn't get much better.  Kudos, and see you again.<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>The line gets ridiculously long at lunch so I always call in my order and dine in. I've tried the Grilled Swai and Salmon.

What I Ordered:
- Grilled Swai
- Half Cajun/Half Garlic Butter (mixed)
- Half Rice/Half Fries
- Side of Grilled Zucchini

TRUST ME. It's amazing mixed! I used to only get just cajun but man...best of both worlds when you mix it!

I've also visited the Brea location and Gardena is WAYYYYYY better. I wished I still worked across the street from here. :(< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Went with her friend for the first time and they did not have what I wanted to order and I had to drive quite a ways I normally go to the one that's on Sepulveda and for me to drive all the way there on Vermont and Artesia and they not have the lime cilantro salmon I was quite disappointed</text>

(Translated by Google) We bought catfish and shrimp and an extra order of potatoes and we were missing the order of potatoes.
We realized already being in the house, we do not return because we live a bit far from the restaurant.

Compramos bagre y camarones y una orden extra de papas y nos faltó la orden de papas.
Nos dimos cuenta ya estando en la casa , no nos devolvemos por que vivimos un poco alejados del restaurante.</text>
