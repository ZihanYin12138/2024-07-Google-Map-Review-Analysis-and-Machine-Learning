I've been coming here for years and never tire of it! The owners are incredibly kind and do everything to ensure all customers receive VIP attention. Even when they're packed, they still take the time to make every customer feel like the only person in the store. If you're a tea lover, Sophie's is the place for you! 💖< /review>

I don't know how to put this any other way, but this is one of the most special places I have ever been too.  This might seem a little extreme for a tea shop; however, Sophie's Cuppa Tea is a sanctuary of peace and serenity.  The owners, Bei and John, are two of the most incredible people I have ever met and they also serve the best tea I have ever had.  I can promise everyone that they will not be disappointed if they come to this shop.   In addition to the shop, if you are looking for your next vacation, ask them about their yearly China Tea Trip.  It is a once in a life time opportunity (although I plan on going every year!).  See photos below :). BTW: They have amazing snacks and salads (fresh and organic).<//review>

<text>Stepping through the door of this beautifully curated spot in Montclair, is essentially stepping into another world, a world of beautiful art, rare porcelain, and even finer teas.
Lovingly tended by John and Sophie,  Tea masters, who have a deep knowledge tea based on regular travel to Fujian as well as other ancient tea sources in China, I was treated to simply the best large glass of simply Wu Long, (Their spelling, I have no knowledge whatsoever of Mandarin) that I've ever had, and was also treated to a rare sight. I have seen tea wheels but none larger than the one I was presented with At Cuppa Tea, easily 30 inches in diameter,, with a specially made tea wheel stand you will only find here, because they had it made especially for their tea wheels.
The decor and mood in the place was an absolute oasis of calm and tranquility in a ever-maddening world, (Even in Montclair)  and is now on my to-do list every time I am in the neighborhood.
I'd try the Wu Long, however, their green tea selection, ( I am a Jasmine pearl fanatic) is simply a marvel of tea curation, and John, was a gracious and knowledgeable host,  with an affable manner sometimes missing in high level tea establishments, and I ended up leaving with a rare Jasmine, as well as a vastly improved attitude, as will you when you visit John and Sophie's Cuppa Tea in Montclair.  Treat yourself to some relaxation!</text><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Great atmosphere & very sweet owners. Loads of choices for tea to drink. I just wish there were more food/snack options. They have some sweets that are almost too sweet to eat but not much selection. It is also a bit unclear how things work here. Like, if you are supposed to find a seat for take service or if you order at the counter. Just a bit confusing. I would go back but not again when I'm hungry.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< name>

Homemade gluten free cakes with healthier ingredients. They take their teas very seriously, but still gentle when I asked only for "green". They paired my gf carrot cake with a nutty type, for balance. Classical.music and warm comfy chairs. Thank you!</review>

One of my favorite places to visit in Oakland. The atmosphere is always so serene and peaceful even when there is live music. I love the owners ...I never knew there was so much to know about tea. If you ever have a question about tea leaves believe me HE can answer it...he knows it ALL 😁</review>

They have more than 26 different types of tea and the owner is very knowledgeable about tea. Try their homemade pies which are yummy and not too sweet.
The tea is not served in paper cups like many other places.
I highly recommend it.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great place to meet friends and enjoy many different teas. The owners are very knowledgeable and friendly. They travel to China to buy their teas directly from the source. They also offer locally made food and make their own ice cream.

Best place in Montclair to relax.</review>

There is a tea that John (Owner) prepares for me and I can not for the life of me remember it. Hmm maybe it is because there is no sugar in it! John does not provide sugar to put in your team You got to drink it straight! Starting to enjoy that now.<//Text>

<Text>A real gem. Sophie's is more than a place to enjoy a cuppa tea. It's an experience and a community where everyone's welcome. It's like a favorite local pub, but instead of pints and salty snacks, it's rare Chinese teas and delicious pastries. The owners' Saturday tastings and talks reveal the immense world of Chinese teas. John and Bei source their teas by traveling to China so they're deeply knowledgeable, passionate, and a joy to talk with. If you have an interest in learning about tea, or just want a great place to rest and read, you should stop in.< /Text>< pictures>

The server seemed to know his tea and make good recommendations. They just oversteap the tea which is a shame. These lovely oolongs (or wou longs) need a more delicate touch.< /Text>< time>

<Text>Tea selection and quality are good, far above what you'd get at a Peet's etc.  However, I wasn't amazed with my wulong, having had better experiences at e.g. Imperial Tea Court or ordering from Red Blossom.  Perhaps the comparison is unfair, and it's certainly the best tea you'll find in a walk-in store for at least a 6-mile radius.

Presentation is a little westernized receiving the brewed tea in a mug with no possibility to experience the progression of flavor as a gaiwan would offer.

The real downside though is the noise.  It was impossible to focus on my tea with a ridiculous conversation going on a few feet away.  By comparison, Peet's down at Lakeshore has a moderate hubbub going on at times, but is far easier to ignore and read, or participate if so inclined. I'm not sure if this could be solved with decor / sound-muting panelling or similar.

Unfortunately the overall verdict is it's not worth the trip just to buy tea to take home when there are so many other high quality options in Berkeley & San Francisco, and it's not a pleasant environment to spend time in contemplation or reading unless at an unpopular time.  If I lived in the neighborhood I might make it a habit.< /Text>< Pics>

<date>1621361567751<//date><rate>5< /rate><text>I bought my first spa (Sundance) a decade ago. I was looking for a new spa, and considered going with Paradise Valley (who I bought my first from) or Creative Energy. I read great reviews on Creative Energy as a company, and saw that the energy efficiency of the Hot Springs spas was superior. I went with Creative Energy and a Hot Springs spa, and am so glad I did. The Creative Energy team had exceptional customer service throughout the entire sales and delivery process. I had two visits to make sure my new spa was installed level (my concrete pad had settled ~2inches), and that the installation process/delivery would be smooth. I feel they went above and beyond my customer service expectations. I hope I don't have to buy another for another decade, but if I did (because I moved/etc.?), I would definitely go back to Creative Energy.< /text>< pictures>

I visited the San Mateo store to order a spa.  Josh Dodge was very knowledgeable and spent time to help us determine the model we wanted.  The delivery was well done.  Josh Dodge came out the next day and set up the spa for me explaining everything I needed to do.  It was a wonderful experience and I love my new Envoy spa</Text>

<text>I had an electrical issue with my hot tub. Fortunately it was still under warranty. I was very impressed with the service I received from the Creative Energy service department. They systematically replaced various parts that they thought might have been responsible for the problem and ultimately they  corrected it. It took a while, three scheduled visits,  but it got done and I am very happy to have my functioning hot tub back! As with all the other contacts I have had with Creative Energy, the staff are helpful, professional and very easy to work with.<//text>< name>

It was a very easy process to purchase.  We went to the showroom, were assisted by very knowledgable experts and received all the information we needed to make a decision.  Then we made the purchase, the installation was easy and Creative Energy has been a great resource ever since.  We are pleased with our decision!</text>

Last spring, when I first tried to contact Creative Energy - Richmond I couldn't get an answer on the phone or a response to left messages. I had to call Creative Energy - San Mateo to ask the Richmond store to contact men. I was finally able to order a new cover in July and paid the deposit in September. Today is Nov. 1 and the cover has still not arrived. I have not heard a word as to status.

In September we had a "contract" repair person come because the heater was not working. He repaired the heater, and then sent a $2500 estimate for "needed repairs." When I inquired if the additions were a) essential to replace, or b) expected to need replacement. I received the following note. "Randy inspected spa.  Found faulty heater, ozone, and control panel is starting to get blurry. Will send estimate for repair.  He suggested heater because spa wasn’t heating.  Ozone isn’t completely necessary.  It helps the chlorine to work better. He suggested the control panel because it was starting to get blurry."  We are still left unclear how to proceed.

I would suggest that some customer service training is in order.</review>

I hired Creative Energy to move our hot tub (purchased from Creative Energy many years ago) from our old house to our new one.  The workers were easy to get along with and very competent, and were careful not to damage my plants.  I had originally intended to level the surface at the new house, but they pointed out that the slope was gradual enough that I probably didn't need to do so, thereby saving us money.  Charged a reasonable price for the job.  One criticism:  they arrived late, outside the scheduled time window.  While there was a good reason for the delay, they did not, and should have, called to warn me that they would be late.<//Text>

I bought my hot tub at Creative Energy and everything went smoothly. Cole was an excellent salesperson, very knowledgeable and personable, as well as friendly and accommodating. I opted to use their maintenance service. Wilbur came out recently for the first service. He was excellent at educating me and providing quality service. I highly recommend them! I LOVE my hot tub!</text>

Thanks to everyone at Creative Energy. From the nice people on the phone, to the delivery of my new tub cover I was treated very well. Returning calls, letting me know when arriving at my home, all communications went smoothly. My repair guy was prompt, knowledgeable, and very personable. The only reason I rated with 4 stars instead of 5 is the price of the cover. If I could have given a 5.5 I would have. Thanks again, I recommend your company for anyone who is in need of this type of service!

Peace ✌️ to you and yours always. bigbadb61< /Text>

Pretty expensive and should have carried some things. To charge $250 and then not have what is needed and have to come back two weeks later shouldn’t happen. I do recognize that models are different but you guys should carry pumps and boards..maybe.<//text>

We love our hot tub and would not think to buy it anywhere else.  The service at Creative Energy is fantastic.  Staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the products they sell are top notch.  If we ever have questions, staff is very helpful and hands on.  We would definitely recommend Creative Energy!</review>

<text>The Creative Energy sales location where I purchased my Hot Springs Spa is in Pleasanton, but the Creative Energy service center in Richmond has been very helpful with troubleshooting minor problems with my spa, and providing repair parts.

This was a very good experience overall. The initial arranging could be smoother but the on-cite work and interactions with Dave, the tech, were really superb. Dave took the time to explain and teach, in clear and accurate terms, how to properly maintain the spa’s chemistry. It made the visit a pleasure and I remain very grateful.< /Text>

< Review>
I bought a used hot tub from what turned out to be an irreputable business in Marin -Spa Mania... DON'T GO THERE! The owner said my tub was 5 years old. Turned out it was 20 and shorted out (dangerous). Creative Energy repaired that tub but finally I decided to invest in one with them since there service was so good. Their service is amazing, prompt, thorough. Couldn't be happier.< /Review>

This is our second spa and we learned from experience that service is the most important factor followed by a high quality product.  We shopped a lot this time and settled on Creative Energy and bought a Hot Springs Prodigy spa from John.  He and the others team members there proved to be very knowledgeable and honest with a high priority on good customer service.  We've owned the spa now four years and had no problems at all.  If we have a question, we've been able to count on calling John or one of the other there and getting a very good answer.  We're very happy with our choice.< /Text>

<Text>We took forever to research all of the options for a hot tub and Bonnee never made us feel like we were being taxing.  I was worried about the installation and Bonnee even offered to phone in on her day off (the installation went perfectly).  I am SO happy with our tub and feel confident we will have it for a long time and if we have any problems, I feel sure that we would get great service.</Text>< Pictures>

But some was due to a inaccurate  initial evaluation of my fireplace.  But in the end, the insert was well installed, and I  am very pleased with it.  Through all the problems,  I can say that the people I talked to were never rude,  called me back when I left a message, and accommodated my need for documentation.  I am glad that I hung in with them because I got a really beautiful and functional fireplace that has made my home more comfortable.</review>< pics>

Update: within 12 hours of posting this review, the operations manager reached out and rectified the situation to me satisfaction. I am happy to see Creative Energy takes customer service so seriously.

I updated my review to five stars.

---

I had Creative Energy service my hot tub in 2017 and they needed to replace the wireless controller. 15 months later (3 months after the warranty had expired) they had to replace it AGAIN! $900 each time! I use the wireless controller less than my cell phone and it needs to be replaced more often at a higher price point. I think they or Hotspring should take some responsibility for this, but they didn't offer to.< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>The heater in our Hot Springs spa died after 7 years of virtually flawless performance.
I left a message for Creative Energy over the weekend, the Service Department called Monday morning and dispatched Dave Kirley on Tuesday.

Dave arrived right on time, diagnosed the problem and before I knew it, had the repairs completed and we are back in "hot water" by evening!

Dave did such a great job, that later that day I called Creative Energy to sign up for their regular cleaning and maintenance service, so our spa will always be clean, serviced and ready for another comforting soak.

Our Hot Springs "Grandee" hot tub is the 2nd one we have purchased from Creative Energy and if we move again, we will undoubtedly call them for a 3rd.

Thanks, Dave for such a great job, your professional technical support is greatly appreciated. Creative Energy really should give you a raise!</Review><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

<response>None</response><Text>I've had my Tiger River hot tub for 10 plus years. Over the last 6 months I've had the
"ready light blinking" this means that the heater is being shut down or at least this was
the problem that I encountered. I was  advised to clean or change the filter by more than one person who implied they knew… After buying 3 additional filters and keeping them clean the problem continued. Enter Dave Kirley from creative energy.
He quickly solved the problem with his 20 years of experience, had the parts on the truck and I'm now back to problem free daily hot tub use.

Nothing but great things to say about Creative Energy and Dave</Text><rate>5</rate>< gmapID>

<Review>We call David Kasten to have our remote panel replaced. The young lady in service sent Dave Kirley out. He was on time, clean. He looked at the panel, asked some questions about the use of the spa. Dave then opened up the main panel and removed the problem remote. Installed the new unit and seal it. He then check out our spa and made some adjustments. Dave made sure that everything was clean and working properly.< /Review>< pictures>

<Response>None</Response><text>This is the worst interaction I've had with a business, possibly ever.

Had an issue with my hottub, called to schedule an appoint, it took me sending several unresponded to emails to actually hear back and get an appointment schedule (I would soon find out this is basically their status-quo for communication), they had also made me plain-text send my credit card info over email because apparently they have no more sophisticated way of actually taking this info.

Finally got something scheduled, the technician determined the heater had broken, but did not have the necessary part so would have to schedule another appointment, and that Creative would reach out to schedule that since they'll know the part number etc. No big deal, the technician himself was actually great, and seemed effective at their job, and was happy to explain their process in diagnosing the issue (this would end up being the only positive impression I have for the entire company).

It is at this point I get no communication for a few days still, until finally receiving a "Here is your quote, please acknowledge this to confirm" type email. I respond promptly and hear nothing for four or five days, I message again and continue to get ZERO response for almost a week, until I email yet a third time, to which FOUR DAYS after that I finally get an email.

This email which has now come over 2 weeks later-- with 4 unanswered emails from me to them-- contains an encrypted zip file, and a message with a password to the zip file, saying to please open and follow the instructions.

This seems very questionable but I just want my hottub working again and I'm too exhausted with their customer service to reply and wait possibly weeks again for a response. I open the zip file in a computer I don't mind reformatting (since i'm feeling very suspect to this random zip) and find a nonsense microsoft word document.

I message back explaining I have no idea how they want me to move forward, and if they can give me ANY ETA AT ALL as to when this second appointment can get scheduled. Once again I hear nothing for 2 or 3 days, until I get an email:
"Sorry. We got hacked. Please don't open it. Please, make sure your anti-virus software is up-to-date"

The company I have had an extremely difficult time communicating with, who made me plain-text email my credit card info, ignored my messages until finally sending me a virus, appologizing while STILL NOT GIVING ANY ETA OR RESPONSE TO MY ACTUAL UNDERLYING ISSUE.

I finally get a relevant email from them yet another day or two later explaining that the supplier doesn't have the part in stock, but they should "early next week", and they will reach out then. (you already know what happens next)

Over two more weeks pass, with me sending four completely ignored emails, until FINALLY I get an email of them asking if I'd like to schedule friday morning, I'm completely exhausted with them, and just relieved to actually have a date scheduled.

Today is that Friday, and lo and behold, I get another email from them, saying their technician is ill, and will not be able to come in for the repair.

I have no idea how this establishment has so many positive reviews, I can only assume it's their friends and family pumping with fake reviews, along with a slew of bot reviews that they've paid for. My ask for this company was an extremely trivial and reasonable one, it's not like I had some esoteric hottub, or esoteric issue with my hottub.

I would urge ANYONE who reads this to please consider LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE for their hottub or spa needs, unless you don't mind waiting months for nothing to actually happen. This has been the absolute worst interaction i've had with a small business, worse than any interaction I've had with big businesses for that matter.</text>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have dealt with Creative Energy and Hot Spring Spas for more than 30 years. The quality of Hot spring Spas is unsurpassed. I have owned three different spas, starting with a larger one and then progressively going down to the smaller size, but not the smallest. My present spa is considered a 3-person spa and it is just right for me. I wouldn't have any other brand and I recommend Hot Spring to every one who has asked. As to service, Creative Energy has the best technicians. Always helpful and considerate and willing to answer any questions. I'd give more stars if I could!<//review>< Pictures>

Employees seemed apathetic, the sandwiches are tiny, and you'll give up a pretty penny for one ($13 for a sandwich).

On the bright side, I found the Bahn Mi pretty tasty.< /text>< rate>

<text>I bought Cuban sandwich and croissant, was charged $10.50 for a croissant and when I complained and asked, the older lady was very rude and said it's correct, and then kept saying "the guy took, it was the guy", I didn't understand her English and I am traveling alone, no guy with me. I got upset and asked what's her name, she said good bye. I repeatedly asked for her name and she ignored me completely. People like that should not work at an international terminal. No customer service, no English, and extremely rude.< /text>< pics>

It was this or panda express that were open. Should have followed the group of pilots to panda express even though we don't like it. Ink.Sack was the only food my wife and I ate that day and both of us got food poisoning.< /review>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>Would give more stars if the staff wouldn't be so rude. Also, they ran out of everything vegetarian and every cheese except for cheddar. That leaves you with 9 sandwich choices out of the 18 they offer. Took 20 minutes for my sandwich to be ready. It's an airport, it's a sandwich, common... Sandwich tastes good, for the price way too small though!</Review>< pics>

Tasty, but heavy. Limited choice of sides (chips = bag of chips). Sandwiches are small for the price, but it’s one of the cheaper options in this terminal (4/5).</Text>

If you’re ever tempted to buy a sandwich at ink.sack at LAX, DON’T! Not only are they a rip off but the staff is rude. And don’t even think of asking for water that doesn’t come in a bottle priced at least at $5.00 because they won’t give it you going so far as saying that the tap water is “unfiltered” and somehow unsafe.

This place gives new meaning to the term rip off. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else that will at the very least not be rude while your paying highly inflated prices even by LAX standards.< /Text>

<text>Good sandwiches. I ordered Banh Mi which was delicious. Staff seemed a bit tired and less responsive. This place offers cheap food as compared to other places in the food court. Located near gate 150 and isolated from the food court, there is plenty of seating available for a peaceful quick bite.<//text>< pics>

<review>Pretty good sandwich place in the international departure gates area of the airport.  The sandwiches weren't anything special to me.  There was a strong spicy pickled flavor to my godfather sandwich but that's it.  What really put me off was that I saw employees laying down on the couches meant for passengers.< /review>< date>

$12 for a pack of chips because after over 30 mins of wait to prepare my Banh Mi sandwich, I had to run to catch my plane barely on time because it was last call. Worst thing, the staff finalizing the sandwich was taking his time as if he just didn't want to be there, and the woman taking order didn't warn anybody that they couldn't process the orders anyways. Worst experience ever if you want to grab a quick bite before taking a 12 hours flight!< /Review>

<review>So disappointing! My husband and I were pumped to try out a Michael Voltaggio restaurant, and even more excited that it's one of the few places at the International Terminal to offer vegan options. Of the 18 sandwiches on the menu, two were available. Yes, two. And both were chicken. How hard is it to have tofu prepared?! Seriously, get it together!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

While the big black woman behind the counter was rude enough to already give this place one star, it also advertises with a bahn mi, which does not even come close to a decent bahn mi.
If I had an enemy departing from LAX, I'd recommend him/her Ink Sack</Review>

<Review>Holly Moses, this sandwich shop needs to improve tremendously!  None of the staff seems to know what's going on.  There's no product consistency.  I ordered 2 ham, egg and cheese sandwiches but there are no eggs. So it's just ham and cheese.  Both sandwich  had a different type of meat.  They don't give napkins unless you ask. They rang me for just one sandwich so had to wait for another 10 mins so they can make the other one....They didn't give me my receipt so I couldn't show them that I actually ordered 2.  I had to tell them I'll pay it again before someone finally told the kitchen to make another. No bags for the sandwiches either.  Hey Voltagio!!! Visit your restaurant dear and re-train your staff.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Staff, particularly Sheena were sooooo rude.  The food was nice but when I ordered a beer and a wine I had to show 2 different I.D's and they were poured into plastic cups. I am 50years old. If I look under 21 I don't mind but I don't think I do. Sheena needs a course in Customer service that's for sure!!!!  Won't be spending my money there again.<//Text>

This is possibly the cheapest food option in the International Terminal. A sandwich for around $7, which is cheaper than the Panda Express. I got the Banh Mi, which was pretty good but not as good as the store near Weho. The size of the sandwich is medium and was fine for a light meal. The jalapeños gave it a little kick. The Mexican chocolate cookie was also decent with a bit of spice. There was plenty of comfortable seating around and was slightly removed from the food court area which is more hectic.</Review>

<Text>I decided to check around while waiting for my flight. As I looked at the sample sandwiches, I saw flies on the sandwich (fruit flies, but still flies) when I told the clerk she responded she did not care. I replied she should care if I called Health Department and still kept saying she did not care.
How can an establishment like this, and use the name of the Spanish Chef, Jose Andre's, hire people with that attitude.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2b1273c38df99:0x77598d1b78ca4fb4</GmapID>< Time>

<Text>As with most of the places in LAX, I think this restaurant is a concept provided by the chef(s) and executed by a separate company under license. In this case Michael Voltaggio has leant his “Ink” brand to LAX in the form of his second branch of Ink.Sack, his LA sandwich shop. What is great about this place is that the prices seem to be the same here as outside of the airport - $6.99 for a sandwich. And with most sandwiches, as long as the ingredients are good, it can be assembled in quick order without too much difficulty. The place was quiet when I went and pickup was very quick. A Jose Andres was ordered, one of the cold sandwiches they offer and I was on my way.

On the flight I opened the sandwich and it was still in good condition, despite there being a vinaigrette, it wasn’t soggy and the ham and chorizo married well with the olives and manchego. A good sandwich that went well with the bottle of whatever wine offered on board.

If you’re looking for something that will satisfy you on the flight, take a look here, it’ll help with any hunger pangs in the middle of the night.<//Text>< Pics>

Indifferent staff. Ridiculously long wait - 20 minutes for a cold sandwich while staff stood and gossiped with the lady from Umami Burger< /Text>

I happened to be late to my appointment due to a bad car accident on the freeway that was out of my control. While stuck in traffic, I called the salon and advised them of my appointment with Lauren and that I’d be late. I asked if I needed to reschedule. I was told, “No, it’s totally okay, I’ll let Lauren know.”
I arrived to the salon 25 minutes late (yes I know, I expected to reschedule). While checking in, I received a text from Lauren stating she has a client after me and would only have time to do one of my hair services, or I could reschedule. I told the lady at the front about the text. She brought Lauren up front. I was totally fine rescheduling however, what I was not okay with was her bad attitude. Trust me, I know your time is valuable, as is mine, as is the client after me. Poor attitudes and customer service don’t get you anywhere. Be cautious when booking with Lauren. It makes sense that all the other stylists at Fringe are booked for months...they do fantastic hair and have great attitudes.< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1614979265554, 'text': 'Hi Erica,\n\nThis is the manager at Fringe.  I am the one you originally spoke to about being late to your appointment. You stated over the phone you would be 10-15 min late, which would have been fine for Lauren’s schedule.  You never stated there was an accident; and while that is a legitimate reason for being late, it does not mean that the stylist can still perform the service you asked for. You did not give us another update to let us know you would be an additional 15 min late. You ended up arriving 30 min late to your appointment.  We are completely accommodating to people that are a little late, but 30 min makes a big difference with timing when it comes to a lightening service, especially a Balayage appointment.  Lauren had a client scheduled after you and would not be able to complete the full service due to you arriving 30 min late.  She did offer you an alternative solution to wash, tone and blow out your hair or reschedule, which you denied both. Lauren is an amazing stylist whom we are incredibly happy to have working for Fringe.  She has a very busy schedule and happened to have a cancelation, which made it possible for you to book with her online. I was near the front desk when Lauren spoke to you and she sounded very professional as she always is.  We understand you are upset that you couldn’t get your hair done today, but accidents are out of our control, as much as they are yours.'}< /Resp><gmapID>0x8094680c455d9d75:0xd3aa07d2606132f4< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><Review>This is my favorite hair salon in Fresno!!! I have tried several different places and several colorists in both Fresno and LA and this place has by far the best balayage colorists. It says a lot that I drive all the way from LA just to get my hair done here.

I started off going to Laci who does an absolutely amazing job. I have long brown hair and always like to go lighter with a natural balayage look. Laci is very popular and often times booked out, so she referred me to Alysa who I have gone to the last two times now.

Alysa always does a beautiful balayage. Outside of balayage, she is also really good at doing color corrections, fun/cool colors, and brunettes. Alysa is also so friendly and sweet. They provide nice refreshments throughout your appointment. I absolutely love coming here and send all of my friends to Fringe!<//Review>< Pictures>

<gmapID>0x8094680c455d9d75:0xd3aa07d2606132f4</gmapID><Text>Stephanie is my stylist and there just aren't enough good things to say  about her that would do her any justice.
I met her through Debbie the manager who is  another fantastic asset to Fringe Salon. Actually, everyone there is very pleasant. The atmosphere is great and upbeat and abuzz with lots of busy stylists. But, be sure to bring extra money because you won't make it out of the foyer without going goo goo ga ga over everything they have for sale with really good prices.
Now, back to Stephanie. She makes me feel very comfortable and right at home.
She has a spectacular personality only to be rivaled by her skills as a stylist.
She styles your hair exactly how you want her to do it. I know. Hard to imagine. Right? But I  assure you. Right here is  the real deal and I'm so happy to have found such an awesome new home.<//Text><username>Raelynn Renna</username><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1599767124795</time></record></dataset><record>

However, I wasn’t happy with the cut, but they did offer to fix. At that point the trust was broken. Luckily, I have long hair and it won’t be too noticeable, but if I straighten it is when it is most noticeable. The only thing I can suggest is maybe having a senior hairstylist pair up with those who may be newer to the game until they find their flow and especially for the price of the cut.<//text><pictures>None</pictures></record>

During the consultation we explained to you that due to the fact you have henna in your hair we were worried about a chemical reaction to the bleach.  We did a strand test in the back and it lightened up well.  We decided there was no negative reaction to the chemicals, however it seams as though you have only put henna in the front of your hair.  After performing the balayage using bleach the stylist discovered that you were not lifting at all on the sides and front, and determined that's where the henna was prominent.  There is no way for any stylist to know how many levels of lift you will achieve due to the fact of using henna. This caused the over all look to not be as light as requested.  We were supposed to meet this morning to discuss a solution, but you never showed up.  You left last night without paying, and we are left with your bill, and no opportunity to fix the situation."}< /Response>

Number one, I have to state how much I loved Liz my stylist!!!  I am extremely picky and I could not have been more pleased!! She was fantastic & colored my hair like she had read my mind...my only complaint is pricing. I was quoted $158.00 on the phone for the cut, 2 highlights (colors) and of course the blow out however when I was taken to the front & was told by the stylist $215.00 I was shocked! #1 live up to your quote even if you have to eat it the first time...that is just "integrity in business practice". 2nd: offer an explanation as to why you have increased your price by $57.00 which is a large😯difference. Then to be told you only take cash was the ultimate shocker 😯😟since our society revolves around debit/credit cards. I haven't written a check since 2006. I like to be very candied with my reviews, honestly pays off for both parties. Now I will be returning to "Fringe" Salon due to Liz my stylist and speak with her about my review. The salon itself was above average as far as cleanliness, style and friendliness. So I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the pricing quote I was given on the phone...integrity above all in business procedures! Thank you, Luana Zentner 11/19/2018< /text>

I love this place. One of the best experiences I've had at a salon by far. When my stylist retired, I was completely shocked.But, as always, she took care of me, and referred me to Fringe Salon off of Herndon & Palm, Fresno. I have never been more satisfied. Helpful staff, professional services, perfect location and affordable. Highly recommended & well deserved. Thanks Fringe!< /Review>

<response>{'time': 1548815624319, 'text': "Hi Laura, Normally I would not feel the need to respond to a negative review but since you have attacked my character for no good reason I feel the need to defend myself. First off I'd like to apologize that you feel like you where treated unfairly. It is always my goal to keep my clients happy. But it’s unfair of you to claim I did a “terrible job” on your hair when you never came in for a service, and I've never met you or talked to you face to face. Also, after you felt the need to undermine me via text message and tell me how to do my job and what you were willing to pay, I decided that I was not the hairdresser for you, and that is my right to refuse service to anyone. I was also very uncomfortable with the fact that you had already booked an appointment with my coworker, all the while consulting with me for your color. My intention was not to come of snobby or rude as you have written above but to save us both from an unpleasant experience as I could tell I was not a good fit for you. I wish you good luck in the future and hope this cleared things up. - Alysa"}< /response>< Pics>

Love this place!! Clean, pleasantly busy,  and tons of different stylists. They also have  a great variety of lines of higher end products: Davines, pureology, TIGI bed head, etc. Yolie always cuts my hair exactly how I want it.<//text>

<time>1578420182310<//time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I like having this urgent care right in my neighborhood but unfortunately, I wasn't cared for at all. Went in with a throat infection, a fever that had been going on for a week, I just wasn't getting better. The Doctor (G. WILLIAMS) prescribed me antibiotics and let me know how important taking antibiotics is instead of trying to get better without antibiotics and the risks. When I got the antibiotics the pills were just too large for me to swallow. I contacted the doctor and let him know my situation. Instead of prescribing a smaller pill, or liquid, he told me to break it up and take it that way. I informed him it was a gel capsule and impossible to break up. He obviously didn't care and did nothing for me. I have no antibiotics to get better and run the kidney and heart risk since I was never given antibiotics. Can't stand doctors that don't care for a sick patient.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I went in for the second time in one week. Was seen by Doctor Williams. On first visit he said I had bronchitis and ear infections both ears. After taking antibiotic I felt worse. I went in again for sinus pressure, persistent cough and ear pain. He then told me he didn’t diagnose me with ear infections or bronchitis, even though I left with antibiotics. He was in and out the room in less than 3 minutes and only checked my ears after my persistence about pain. He rushed out the room and said anything over the counter should be fine. I still has unanswered questions and he was nowhere to be found. I got an email alert wrapping up my visit with Saint Agnes before I even left the parking lot. Would definitely not go back and definitely not recommended him to anyone. Aside from him staff was excellent.<//text><GmapID>0x809468cda4e18bb3:0xfcbf4790aefa01b4< /GmapID><UserId.>106669164942532865822< /UserId.></record>

Even with lobby full, wait time was not long. Staff moved quickly and was very caring! Thank you for your hard work, with elderly mother happy to get her in and out. Better than the main campus, 2-3 hr wait ridiculous!!!< /text>

Terrible! I went in and got diagnosed with the flu. Dr. prescribed me something for my chest as it was congested. I got to pharmacy and they did not have the order. When I called it was closed. Called in morning and informed them. They said Dr. Will call me back as she was looking at charts. Never got a returned call nor did they order the medicine. What type of facility does this? Unethical!</Review>

Went in for fever cough congestion and headache and was told it was just a virus and that I would only get meds to treat the symptoms when I went to pick them up nothing was sent over and I called multiple times and Sandy said she would ask the doctor again and call me back then I got a call back from someone different by the name of Victor and was told that the doctor had not prescribed me anything because it was just a virus and to take over the counter meds if I wanted to the whole thing felt like a waste of time and like they just didnt want to ask the doctor would not recommend going here if you really want to get better< /review>

Then depending on what you came in for or if you have insurance, will be added to your bill. They do have a payment plan. Be sure to call ahead and ask for waiting time. It definitely helps!

I have been seen three times here and I can not say enough about the excellent service. The facility is clean, the staff is kind, they acknowledge you immediately when you walk in, and I have seen a different Dr. Each time and they have all been very professional and quick. I understand if some people feel they seem rushed but HELLO it is an urgent care facility. We are not there to chat about the weather. I wish I could make them my primary provider. Keep up the great patient care!<//review>

<review>I have been on hold for an hour & 5 minutes. I saw the NP this morning. I have a kidney infection no fever or any tell tale signs other than horrendous back & side pain.  Got antibiotics and no other instructions.  By the time 3 o'clock came I spiked a 101.5 fever (after taking tylenol). Now its 102. I just want to know if I should be concerned. Also, tylenol isn't cutting the pain. Still on hold.  An hour and 10min. After 2hrs, the line rang and then hung up.  Now I have 102.2. Hope that's okay</review>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This was the worse experience I ever had with American healthcare.
Two days ago I made a wrong move and I felt a painful noise in my knee. Because I’m here for vacation I tried to get some information from the internet and made some calls. So In the end I got in touch with Saint Agnes urgent care on Herndon Avenue. I called and told what happened and my insurance situation. Because I had the same with my other knee 12 years ago in knew exactly what i want.
The friendly operator told me because they don’t accept Florida Blue shield HMO I can pay cash and after she put me on hold she said “$120 for consultation and about 39 for X-ray.” She said I can schedule an appointment online or I can walk in.
So I the next day my wife drove me down to get the X-ray done.
I was very surprised how unfriendly I got treated at the counter of this healthcare facility. A receptionist named “Nina “( more info about her name and employee number she was not willing to give) told me “ you have HMO , we can’t help you. I said “ I’ll pay it cash “  answer” no , now I know you have HMO insurance, we will not accept cash” I explained my pain and that I need help and a diagnosis. She told me , that’s not her problem ,  you need to call someone else.I told her that I called before I did the one hour drive.
She behaved very arrogant and when I ask for her supervisor she said” there is no supervisor in Fresno I can speak to. So we left. On top of my pain I was very upset and shocked about the rough and unprofessional behavior of this receptionist. I think someone must educate her about manors and urgent care. Especially the meaning of “ URGENCY “.  She also needs to be educated to understand the patient is a customer and not an enemy.
Because she said over and over “ this is our policy “ I can only say “ when you need help don’t go there”
We found a helpful and friendly urgent care center on willow ave.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

And waited only another 5 min for the provider. Within the next 10 min I had x-rays and lab tests done. A diagnosis was given and was done with in 30-45 min.</review>

My 4 year old son fell and fractured his arm so I took him here. There was virtually no wait time at all.  He hates going to any kind of hospital and always yells and puts up a big fight, but all the staff was incredibly patient and very kind. Big shout out to Dr. Williams for for doing a great job on the cast and to the nurses for digging up Spiderman stickers to help him feel better. Totally give this place 5 stars.< /Text>

From beginning to end the entire staff that assisted me and my son were polite, professional, helpful and pleasant. The office and rooms were clean, the MA was nice, the doctor was great. He explained his reasons for the treatment and medications he suggested. I didn't feel rushed, we were in and out in under an hour. Medications were sent to our desired pharmacy without issue. A few clerical errors were made in our charts, I called and they were corrected instantly. I've worked at an urgent care before. I know how busy it can get, the crazy things that can happen, and these people exceeded my expectations for urgent care treatment. I will definitely be back.<//text>

Called to make an appointment with my regular doc for sinus infection and wont be able to be seen till next month so made an appointment for this urgent care through online and went in got called in to see the nurse less than 20 mins, how awesome not a long wait at all! Doctor took about 10 mins to see me and prescribed me some medication and it was sent to cvs right away. I was literally in and out! Everything was quick everyone was nice so this place deserves 5 stars!</review>

Waited an hour in the waiting room, which wasn’t bad compared to how many people were there. The assistant went right in the room and took all my vitals and info. He left for not even five minutes and the doctor came in (Dr Fard) to get started on my toe (ingrown nail). It took him about 20 minutes for the procedure, but was always talking with me, to keep my mind off the pain. They sent my Rx to the pharmacy and I was on my way! I definitely recommend this place!</review>

HELL ON EARTH!!  I took my brother on  01/06/17 and they denied him service because  “ HE HAD STATE INSURANCE “  I offered to pay in cash and was told they couldn’t accept cash. My brother was in the lobby fainted and having convulsions. I told them my brother need it help and they told me they couldn’t  help him but they could call 911 for me.. UNBELIEVABLE I was discussed. The doctor that was on duty should be ashamed to call him/her self a doctor and they claim THIS IS A HOSPITAL WITH COMPASSION AND COMMITMENT LIVE.  Yeah right I will never take  my wife or kids to this place. they don’t care about the patients they only care about draining our insurances  $$$$....😡😡😠😡< /review>

I was very anxious and nervous and in a lot of pain. Kyleigh and Jennifer were very kind and attentive the moment I walked in. They calmed me down and were a great help in making me feel better in the exam room. I appreciate both of them tremendously. Great service and wonderful doctors as well. Thank you!<//text>

<review>I been going to this urgent care for a while now. One thing they need to work on is answering the phone. Every time  I try to call I am put on hold for 45-1 hr  without  Speaking to anyone. On one occasion I went to the location while still  on hold I figure it must be so busy but instead the staff was chatting with one another and only 4 people waiting.< /review><UserId.>109046970919088921426<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

First of all, please don't share this review, as if more people find out about you, then we will have a longer wait!  LOL!  Even though we had to drive across town from Clovis, we were pleasantly surprised that there were very few clients and that we were seen in a timely manner.  Everyone was so very helpful and compassionate, not to mention knowledgeable!  We hope that we won't need to visit you again, but wouldn't hesitate to do so. Our only request is that you move to Clovis.  Thanks again for a very positive situation in an otherwise troubling time.< /text>

WATCH OUT PEOPLE !!!!
Very unsafe  practice badddd hygiene and bad patient care with NP Conrad Rios..!!!!
So I took my son in to get a check up today since he been peeing a lot and wanting to go every min and was in pain.. and every time when he goes there was only  a couple of drops and been  3 days now and I don’t know what to do.. so I took him in.. The staff here is ok. Then the NP CONRAD RIOD comes in and tell me that it’s not a UTI and then begin to a Physical exam my son.. He didn’t even wear any gloves or wash his hand afterwards...</Review>

Don't even know who she is since she never introduced herself.  She has no name badge on was in scubs.  Before she even assessed my mother she already had said it was only Arthritis and only needed NSAIDs.  The wait time was 2 hrs when there was only 4 people before us.  Don't come here!!!

<time>1504294322296<//time><rating>3</rating><Review>It would take forever to reveal all the stupid things that have happened here over the years. The security guards are overly aggressive and officious, bordering on psychotic. A few times, I have been helped, but for the most part, it's been horrible. Again, it goes back to the security guards who really need to learn to mind their own business. Hours of waiting! A few of the staff members were very nosey when I came in with a very deep laceration. They wanted to "see" it. I had my wound wrapped up and on separate occasions, employees wanted me to show them my wound. No, I'm not talking about the attending doctor. I'm talking about people from billing and some other schmo who heard about my wound. Wth????<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Warning, do not come here!
I took my 3 years old daughter in to be seen for a possible UTI and it as a total nightmare.
I was interrogated for hours by 3 police officers and CPS workers after the on duty doctor said my daughter had signs of being abused. Not sure how the doctor determined this just by feeling her tummy and a quick view at her vagina.
After a 24 hour ordeal, we were sent to a specialist and it was confirmed by the NP that all was normal.
Below a statement given by the NP:
“Her colposcopy anogenitall examination reveals a normal anogenital examination. There is no acute, healing or healed anogenital trauma and no vaginal discharge or malodor noted on her examination”
My family is owed an apology and a refund of the expenses. Smh!< /text>< Pictures>

Best UC ever!  I waited about 20 minutes before I was taken back.  The entire team was very friendly and efficient.  The Dr. Soldo  came in, listened to me and offered treatment to help me.  I have a lung disease (ABPA) so I am constantly sick but this was my first time here and I felt very comfortable.  Dr listened and never made me feel hurried or dismissed what I said.  I would recommend them to everyone!<//review>

I had to go to an urgent Care this morning due to a construction accident. First went to the new Urgent Care on Milburn. They had no one able to stitch up the deep cut on right hand. They suggested St. Agnes.i was thinking the big hospital and started for it. At the corner of Milburn and Herndon, I noticed the St. Agnes Urgent Care and headed for it. So-o-o glad I did. Got there at opening to find many people waiting. Staff were very nice and professional. Waited about 10 minutes.. Dr. Steven Soldo was very competent at every step of the process including his 'bedside manner.' All in all, my visit was very satisfying. Easily the best experience visiting an emergency clinic ever. Thanks to all.</Text>

Was told my wait was 45 minutes. After 2 hours I was called in. I told them I have a new pharmacy and gave them the number they still called it in to the wrong pharmacy. Then they only called in half of prescription and told me it was at new pharmacy but ended up at old one. These people are ridiculous and unprofessional. Go somewhere else< /Text>

Waited 40 mins for a hamburger, with only 2 tables occupied in the restaurant and they literally served us a raw hamburger. Been waiting 20 mins to speak to the manager, so I'm writing this review to kill time......still waiting on her......< /Text>

<review>Unique Taphouse has a fun, relaxed atmosphere. Plenty of space where even during peak hours it doesn't feel cramped. The staff was helpful, especially explaining the self pour taps and offering recommendations for the food. The BBQ Chicken pizza was amazing. The only reason for 4/5 stars was about 1/3 of the taps were out of order, or "Coming soon". Overall great place to grab some beer after work. Would definitely recommend.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

My husband found this place for us to try and it was amazing. The pizza was amazing and the selection of beers was awesome. My husband looked like a kid in a candy store lol. The service was excellent and our server Colleen Miller made our first time experience perfect. I have to say that this is our new spot!!!</text>

IF you are a beer lover this is a great place for you. There is 20 tap beers or more on tap. You pour your own with an id bracelet. You only pay for what you pour. The bracelet keeps track of your ounces and you pay accordingly. Menu is small but the burgers and pizza is great. We will be back.
It is an old time bar with tons of tv's.<//Text>

Service took FOREVER - for the food, and later the check, when it was pretty deserted inside. Luckily, you pour your own beer, otherwise you'd wait way too long to get a refill. Hopefully, they'll work out their service issues. Will give them a second chance in a while.</text></record>

<review>My hubby and I decided to try this place out because everyone says great things about the pizza! Well we never got to try it because the waitresses were too caught up in whatever they were doing on the computer for 15 minutes to even greet us, they obviously knew we were there because they told us it is  seat ourselves. Is it also order and serve yourself? Ultimately we sat for about 15 minutes Being ignored by  dissapointing employees you had working Saturday night. Terrible customer service.<//review>< date>

This place is amazing. Awesome service, friendly staff, and INCREDIBLY good food. This is my fourth time here with my wife and we absolutely love it. How lucky are we that we get to have this here in Murrieta?

A must visit for sure! You will love it.< /text>

<Review>Had to flag down someone to order food. Had to flag someone to check us out.  Asked to speak to manager... yea our server... no help.   Don’t care for going to get your own beer unless it’s cheaper, not so most beer was $10 for a 20oz beer.  The food was ok but is just bar food nothing special. To say the least won’t be going back.  Too many other good places to go to consider a non costumer service is place.<//Review>< username>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>This place is pretty neat overall. I love the concept of getting to pour your own beer by the ounce. We’ve been here a few times now and every time the keg foams like crazy when you pour. I know how to pour a beer from a tap, even the waitresses had trouble getting a decent pour out of the IPA I was wanting. They ended up comping the foamy beers for me, but they weren’t enjoyable to drink since it tasted pretty flat.

The food is okay. Pizza is definitely the best thing they have. The rest of the food is pretty typical ‘bar food’ quality.</review>< Pics>

The food here is amazing, the staff is knowledgable and most importantly, RESPONSIVE. As a beer enthusiast i feel it is important that those who have created a place of introduction for new craft beer drinkers are quick to educate and respond to situations. I made a comment to a waitress about a tap foaming out and before i took a sip of my beverage the problem was addressed and fixed.</Review>

<Review>Pour your own beer! Really good pricing too. Had their potato skin pizza and it was fantastic along with the totchos (nachos with tater tots in place of chips). Really good service to boot.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

Lots of beer on tap (I think 20+), very friendly staff, great food, lots of TV's. This was a pretty great place that has a small, but well thought out, well executed menu with several local (and many non-local) beers on tap. I highly recommend taking the family.< /review>

<Review>Good beer selection, AMAZING FOOD, And Excellent customer service. I came unknowingly on a UFC fight night hoping to catch a NHL game (go Vegas Knights!) and the staff made every effort to try to get the game on for me. Sadly, they couldn’t get the game, but the effort they put in made my day anyhow.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<user_name>Jim Robertson<//user_name><Text>Food is a little pricey but staff is very friendly making a great casual atmosphere. The ability taste and pour your own beer from over 30 different taps is an awesome idea! Will definitely be back, hope the community supports this place as well to keep it in Murrieta.  The only suggestion I have is that they add some bar games.< /Text></record>

Simple concept for drinks, great setup for watching whichever sporting event, average prices for apps/bar food. Overall a seemingly good place to relax and unwind.</Review>

< Review>
Upon entering Taphouse, 3 waitress saw my wife and I entering.  But, didn't greet us.  We had a seat and waited 6 minutes before any waitress came to our table.  Our waitress final came to our table and her body language stated either I don't want to be at work today or maybe just poor customer service.  We ordered the potato tumblers, slider rollers and fries.  Nothing exciting about the food unless you are really hungry.  But, various beers on tap and the crowd seem to really enjoy pouring there on beer.  On the edge of returning or not.<//Review>

I love this place!!! Best food and pizza. I love that they have self serve beer and all the amazing cocktails drinks. I hope Murrieta supports this place. They have so many TVs and they play football games as well as UFC fights. I am definitely coming here with my party to watch the UFC rounda fight.< /Review>

<review>Good selection of beers but service was slow and the pizza lacked flavor. Loaded with cheese, lacking in sauce and a crust that tasted like cardboard. If you are looking for overpriced priced bar food then head here. You looking for decent food go somewhere else and come here for drinks afterwards.<//review>< gmapID>

Size doesn't always matter!

This gym might be on the smaller scale; size wise. What it lacks in squared footage it makes up in quality. 1) The place is overall clean 2) The equipment is new and up to date ( even the free weight section) 3) The owner is down to earth and understands that w/out consumers and customer service you have no business. 4) The convenience of using the facility is the #1 reason I drive 20 minutes each way to use it. Its open 24 hours a day;  can't find time to go to the gym...really?

I hope that this business and many others can overcome the ridiculous BS made up laws that prevent them from thriving. If any business puts themselves out there against the mainstream mantra, then they have my business and support! And Mr. Abdali  you have my patronage and lifetime support! Thank you,< /Review>

<review>Gym is kept clean which is very important to me.  I notice staff often wiping down equipment and cleaning in general.  Good variety of machines and free weights.  Questions about how to use equipment are answered. Staff is friendly and helpful.  I travel working around the US and have used several different gyms.  I highly recommend Anytime Fitness in Fairfield Ca.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808514168e533b1d:0xbdd416e8bad3845< /gmap_id></record>

Nice and quiet. Not a lot of people here so the equipment is normally free. They have two squat racks and a dead lifting platform, which are to me the most important pieces of equipment. The manager is quite friendly, which always makes life easier. The environment is pretty relaxed here. Overall I really like it.< /Review>

<review>Nice private area so you never have to worry about it being too busy, it's very secure with key access to get in and more than plenty of cameras everywhere.
Management is great and friendly.
Recommended gym if you're looking for a long term place that you won't have issues with. There are plenty of machines to workout with, treadmills, sections for weightlifting and an open area room if you like doing workout videos which they have a variety of videos available that you can play.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

This gym is AMAZING!!!! You can tell the manager/owner care about this place. We were greeted and asked if we needed anything. Saw the manager cleaning and he had a good relationship with the regulars. Bathrooms and showers were super clean and nice! Good lay out of the gym as well. Equipment was clean and new! The only negitive I saw is that they have a sign charging $1 for a sweat towel... kinda silly in my opinion.
But anyway! Top knot has gym!</review>

I joined this gym about 1 month ago and I've been very pleased.  The staff are very friendly, helpful and I love that the facilities are kept very clean and organized. Their equipment is modern and in great condition and the gym is never overcrowded! I actually haven't discovered anything that I dislike about this place yet...it's exact what I need and want in a gym. Thanks guys!< /review>

Joining Anytime Fitness is the best decision I have made in years!!! The trainers, Jason and Tito, are awesome! Their knowledge and commitment to helping their members goes above any experience I have had at other gyms!  They helped me meet my goals and much more!  The members are more than members, we are like a family, there to help and support one another.  Best gym I have ever joined!!</review>

So far so good, I have been happy going and more consistently than any other gyms I belong to.  Mostly because, it's small, not overcrowded, open 24 hours, clean, all working equipment and most importantly, no "GYM SMELL" if you know what I mean.  Since my husband and I joined early this year, no complaints whatsoever.  Membership rate is very reasonable for what is offered to you.<//text>< response>

IMO, one of the best equipped gyms in Fairfield. No need to deal with the environment you’ll get at 24 Hr. Lifting here feels like working out at a home gym. Cozy, equipped, and ran well.< /text>

I am in love with the amazing vibe this gym gives. The staff that I have met (Grant-Owner and Justin-Personal Trainer) love their members and are genuine with their encouragement. I did my first work out yesterday. The equipment is of great standard and easy to use. I can't wait to go back tonight.<//Review>

I love them and I like to think they love me back. No matter what I have going on, they have a solution and a plan. I'm soo happy to have been a member since this location opened.

<text>This is a great gym! When I moved to Fairfield, I tried out four other gyms; yet they all were missing either 1 or 2 things I needed for my workout routine. This gym has everything I need and a great atmosphere of people to be around.<//text>< pics>

<review>Love the place. I learned about the place after my friend invited me to start going to the gym. It's been great so far, the staff are friendly, the place is clean, and there's plenty equipment. I would highly recommend this gym to anyone interested.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I love how it's not so crowded in the late evening hours, the atmosphere here really gets me into my zone. For being compact, they have everything I need, with definite pluses! Like, the water massage bed, wifi, 24 hour security and my favorite, the synergy equipment.</review>< Time>

<text>I recently purchased one of their products but was sent the wrong one. I tried contacting them by phone but it’s impossible to reach them, voicemail directs you to email them instead. I emailed them to inform them of their error and they emailed back within an hour, apologized for the error and took care of it immediately.< /text>< Pictures>

Absolutely horrible!!!!

DO NOT USE!!

They charged my card and sent me an invoice saying my payment has processed and my order is “trash”. When I tried to contact them to understand the mixup I discovered you cannot get ahold of them. A week later still no contact or refund. What the heck?!</review>

<text>Fair prices, plenty of options but as of 03/13/20, and probably awhile before then, the phone number listed on Google and on their website is "Not currently in service", and aside from an automated message the day of my purchase, after trying both available emails, I've received no response from the company regarding my order, ETA, or any response at all.
Not sure if they are temporarily closed, out of business or what but if there is anyone working there they arent taking care of the online side of the business.</text></record>

<text>So its 5/16/2020 i order a 4 channel Rockford amp. 165.00 on the 13th of May. After reading other recent reviews going back to February i noticed a lot of ppl saying the same thing. Ordered  status says pending, no numbers to call (that work) and no response from customer service. I use USAA bank i called them told them everything. Come Monday if status hasn't changed to shipped the bank is stopping the transaction.  Banks can do this but they dont like to and most charge to do it. 100% scam< /text>< pics>

<text>I placed an order on Feb 13, 2019 for an amp at a great price. Even received a confirmation email about my order. But per the email still have not received a follow up email with my tracking/shipping details and have tried 4 different methods of contacting this business and no response from any of the information they have listed via email or phone. I feel very unsettled about how this is going, so I have reached out to the BBB and hopefully I can get a response that way. This is the first time anything like this has happened to me via an online purchase and I hope this review helps anyone else in my same situation, please read reviews about a place before even considering making a purchase. Valuable lessons learned...<//text>< pics>

DON'T buy from this website.  SAME experience as others stated in previous reviews (sadly only checked AFTER no communication from Car Audio Giants).  I ordered some JL Audio speakers on Aug 1st, 2019.  Received a payment confirmation and order confirmation and my debit card was certainly charged.  Was promised shipping info within 24-48 hours and here it is Aug 13th and I have ZERO communication back from this company.  PHONE is disconnected and NO reply to 4 different emails.  This is not the way to conduct business for sure.  STAY AWAY.</review>

I ordered a PAC interface on 6/3/19. The Car Audio Giants website confirmed that it was in stock and promised a tracking number within 24-48 hours. After that time period elapsed, I reached out via email and phone to get an update. Come to find out that the phone number listed on their site was not in service and the vendor was not responsive via email. After several day of waiting for tracking info, I requested that the order be canceled. I receive an email later that day stating that the order was canceled because it was back-ordered with no ETA then the initial charge was reversed.  A week later the package showed up on my doorstep and my credit card had been charged again. Being that I had already ordered, received, and installed the PAC interface via a different vendor, I no longer needed this one. I have sent countless emails to the vendor requesting an RMA and pre-paid return shipping label but haven't gotten a response. I have since filed a dispute with my Credit Card company and will be filing a complaint with the BBB.<//Review>

<text>Placed an order. Was supposed to be emailed within 48 hours about status. Never received an email. Tried to call and cancel but customer service phone number was "no longer receiving calls due to high call volume". I called again at least 20 times and received the same message. Sent 3 emails to support and still no response. I would not recommend this retailer.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I purchased a Pioneer AVIC-7201NEX 8/20/2018 and received an immediate auto reply confirming my order.  Also stated in this reply tracking information would be sent within 24-48 hours.  8/23/2018 I received no tracking information.  I called to inquire about my order.  Message stated due to high call volume, they were not accepting any calls and to try back later or email.  I emailed them 8/23/2018 12:38 PM with a copy of my invoice.  I finally received a reply 8/24/2018 5:22  PM stating the unit I purchased was on back order, no time frame given, just the options to wait or cancel.   I canceled my order, I do not care to wait indefinitely nor am I comfortable with the lack of customer service and the inability to contact them by phone.  It's understandable a product is not available, however, it should be reasonable to communicate this in a timely fashion.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Customer Service is the WORST. Sent in an RMA on my own cost in DECEMBER 2017 - It is now OCTOBER 2018 and still haven't received my product back.

Customer service is non existent and their phone number no longer accepts calls. Save yourself a headache and buy locally if you need to<//review>

DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! Purchased a AV-Nex7200 from them. Got it fast and cheaply. 3 months later, the screen on the unit went bad. Got an RMA from them, sent it back, and it has been months with no info. They do not answer their phones, or emails. Do not purchase from them. Will be filling a complaint with the BBB.

Edit: Wound up randomly getting the head unit back from them fixed just recently.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Called ahead because I wanted to make sure that they had the unit in stock and would ship in a timely manner to receive the unit by a certain day, was told they had a unit in stock, placed the order on the web site immediately after.   Next day, was wondering why I hadn't received the tracking information.   Called and found out then that the item was back ordered and wouldn't ship till the following week.   Don't know why I wasn't told that when I originally called.  Now it's too late to order elsewhere for my fathers day present.</review></record></dataset><record>

Don't buy here unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure that what you are ordering will work.  They do offer returns, but kill you on restocking fees. I have now spent $60 in return shipping for two different speaker sets that ended up not fitting my doors.  I spent another $68 in restocking fees.  So $128 total in fees and shipping to send them back merchandise that is in new unused condition.  Crazy.< /Review>

Like others said not good people to work with. On the direct advice of their salesman ordered something that didn't fit my truck. Tried to return it and buy more expensive speakers (extra ($400) but it was just over 30 days and they would allow absolutely no exchange for partial credit or anything. And that is with speakers that had never been out of the box yet. My install guy looked at the box and knew it wouldn't fit so they were never even opened, Spend the extra $10 and deal with a company that values customers.< /Text>

DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM CAR AUDIO GIANTS!!!

I ordered a new car stereo and what I received was a correct box, but an incorrect, used stereo inside.  CAG demanded a 35% restocking fee if I wanted to return it.  Once I FedEx'd it back, they denied they received it back.
Had to get Discover involved to get my money back.  (FedEx had copy of signature when returned)

READ THEIR FINE PRINT.  If you can find it on their web site.</text>

< Review>
Business not backing warranty of a $225 amplifier purchased by my sons hard earned internship money.  Unbeknownst to us that they sent a different model in 2015 upon purchase but now Car Audio Giants claims it was not sold by them.  Seriously,  this company is VERY dishonest & we learned that this business is NOT covered by BBB.  Will not make any future purchases from this company.<//Review>

They shipped me a sony car stereo head unit missing the wiring harness and would do nothing to correct the problem.  The representative called me a liar and said I was making the story up.  Wouldn't let me return the item because it was missing a part, which made me laugh because yea obviously it's missing a part because that's how they sent it!  Car audio giants offered no resolution to this problem after I paid $199.00 for the stereo.  Yea, they have slightly cheaper equipment, but beware, they are a terrible business and will not help you if something is wrong.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Hopefully this review will keep one or many from making the same mistake I did. I ordered nearly $1000.00 of JL Audio marine component speakers form Car Audio Giants. While opening, I noticed the factory seal on one box had been cut. One of the tweeters from that box had a major defect. I emailed pictures and asked if they would replace only the tweeter to save on shipping cost and help with a timely install. They responded “We can diffidently help you. Please send us the tweeter and we will defiantly exchange it for you”. Now when I call they give me the run around, refuse to give their names and ignore my emails. Also notice The Google street view of this business is an ABANDONED MINUTE MART and the only positive reviews sound more like an ad then a real review.DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!@!!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I recently purchased a pioneer touch screen stereo for my chrysler 300 and got an unbelievable deal on a great product.  The product was also backed up by a 3 year warranty!  I was also able to save lots of money by purchasing the installation components through car audio giants rather than buying them through a stereo installation company.  I saved lots of  money that I can now use when I'm in vegas this summer baby wooo!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Bait and switch.  Advertised JL Subwoofer in stock and accepted my order and charged my card.  Get and email days later saying that it is not in stock and they will let me know when they get more in and if I would like to cancel my order I could.  I did and am now waiting my refund!</Review>

Horrible experience will never order from them again. I ordered a flip screen head unit and xm module said was in stock called to double check before i ordered. Ordered then came up as possible fraud charge.  Send everything to get that fixed then they tell me my order is canceled because what i ordered was on backorder.then after my order was canceled they charged my card twice for the same purchase that they had already canceled.</Review>

I ordered a amp that I was planning on installing the following weekend, the website said the item was in stock before placing my order. Two days later I get an email saying it is backordered and it may be a few days before it would ship. I then checked the website again and it still says it was in stock so I decided to go ahead and cancel the order and order the amp from Amazon for a few dollars more.<//text>

<username>Kyle Malone< /username><date>1620614406742</date><rate>1<//rate><text>My family went here for mother’s day. The service was great but the food was terrible. We sat there for an hour watching to go order after to go order leave wondering where our food was.

Two dishes came out 15 min before the other three. Two of the five dishes weren’t even microwaved long enough to heat the meat though.

Edit: the center of the short rib I ordered was cold so it must have been heated up in a skillet or in the oven not the microwave. I use the term heated loosely.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I love this place! Most delicious pasta and flatbread!  I always order the Linguine ,Garlic Chile, Olive oil with some garlic bread, Yum! SOOO good! The best pasta ever, it's always made to perfection. The meatball assortment is great if you want to stay away from the carbs:)< /Text>

My wife and I were craving fish & chips and they were kind enough to split the order. The sanitation of the restrooms is extremely clean and the outdoor seating feels amazing. Some restaurants are struggling with the outdoor seating, but this one has it down. It's a great date spot and consider supporting them during this time.

One of our local favorites, just went there for early Father’s day celebration. Flatbread is a must have, we usually get the prosciutto and figs flatbread, they are heavenly.  The Shrimp Scampi linguine and Blueberry Almond salad were also excellent.< /review>

<Review>It is difficult to find whimsy especially during covid lockdown but mama terano's continues to deliver with their classics and a fresh, exciting, in season specials menu. On top of the delightful food, all the staff make you feel like a cousin coming home after a long trip. You are part of the family but still a special guest. Make sure to leave room for their desserts which are an excellent end to a delicious meal.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Robert Bell's learned from the best....his Mom!  Everything on the menu is fabulous.  I never knew chicken thighs could be sooooo good.  Flat bread to die for.  Reasonable corkage.  Friendly staff.  What could be better?</Review>

We like a lot hanging out. Last night we came to this delicious restaurant which friends recommended to us. We spent a lovely time there with exceptional cooking and a courteous stuff and a great chief cook. We  added this fine restaurant in our phone list  and we will certainly go again soon. We deeply recommend.<//Review>

I’ve been here a few times and I’m never
disappointed. Steamed Clams in a Rich
Wine/Lemon/ Garlic Broth to dip bread.
Lamb Chops to die for and for desert-
a perfect Creme Brulee. The Flat Bread
is a great change of pace. Short Ribs,
when available, do not disappoint. Enjoy!< /Text>

The food is pretty good but can be very salty.  I love their chicken breast dish but wish it came with more vegetables.  Overall, would like more veggie side options.<//text>

I ordered Mama's Lasagna. Portion to price ratio was right on. Veggies had a roasted smokey flavor and wonderful garlic. Service was impeccable. Companion ordered the Cauliflower antipasto (yum), linguini (looked smaller in portion to me but she was pleased, and the olive oil cake with orange and home whipped cream. Overall, I think it's a gem.<//Review>

I had been here previously and the experience was less than 5 star. This most recent visit however, was fantastic. Ordered the lobster ravioli and the lobster taste was not at all overshadowed by the other flavors involved. The staff was very nice as well. Free corkage Monday was a huge plus. If you know Mama Terano's then you know the place is a little tight on space so it was a little noisy and cozy as usual but it's nothing you cannot get used to. It's definitely a good place to go on the hill. Always get a flatbread for your table to share as well as your entrees. The bacon, mushroom, and carmelized onion one is a favorite of my family.< /review>

The ambience is unique and perfect.  I think the name is probably a little confusing (and they should consider changing it so people know this is a wine bar and restaurant).  Anyway, just an amazing find in the deep west village</review>< time>

<review>Very nice little neighborhood Italian restaurant, with a number of unique regional recipes. I've never had anything like their famous flatbread - - delicious and large enough almost for a meal on it's own. My relatives who live nearby eat here often, but it's great for out-of-towners as well. Service is excellent.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is another hidden spot to visit during your San Fran trip. Parking is on street in a residential neighborhood but visitors don't tend to stay long so you should find parking pretty easy. The tile steps are really cool and definitely should be added to your picture collection!< /text></record>

<Review>A hidden treasure in the Sunset district located in the middle of a residential area. The views of the ocean are spectacular from the top. Please be mindful/respectful of the people that live there and heed the warning signs about car break ins.</Review>< Pictures>

Amazing view of the tile mosaic with 200+ steps.

We were there during evening when sunlight was making mosaic view difficult because of the reflection…
I would suggest go there in morning time but then you must the amazing sunset view from the top.

Very beautiful neighborhood with succulent plants and flowers on the street.</Review>

This is a hidden gem in SF. The art is great and the garden next to the steps is amazing with different plants. Pls be safe and hide all your important belongings before you go. Multiple car break ins.<//text>

Beautifully design mosaic step that seems to tell the story of Genesis. This picturesque stair should not be missed from your visit to SF. As this is one of the local gems, and it is the best kept secret spot in SF.<//Review>

Nice little spot to take pictures and get an amazing view of the ocean to the West of San Francisco. It can get a little busy at times, so if you're taking photos you will need a little patience. Tips for taking photos:

Bring a telephoto lens to get some nice shots of the ocean, or a lens with a fast aperture to blur out the crowds in the back. The colors are nice, so be sure to capture them! Otherwise, great little spot to checkout.<//Review>

For what it is, is actually pretty cool. Is around 150 steps to the top and the view is amaizing< /review>

Very nice place to take beautiful pictures of the steps. Also worth climbing them up to enjoy good views of the city. A hidden small treasure in San Francisco. Better in the afternoon. One can park on the street nearby.< /text>

Walked over an hour to reach this place.... Easy to find. I enjoyed all the ups and downs during the walk. When I reached the stairs, they are well kept. If you want to go higher for a nice photo view make a left at the very top and walk about another 8 min.< /Text>

I was part of a guided tour, and was simply blown away by the artistry and tiled work on these stairs (and let's not discount being blown away by the forceful winds. Remember to pack a jacket). The views from Turtle Hill nearby are nothing short of magical.

It's a lot of stairs. Be prepared for a workout<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Lovely tourist site in San Francisco.  The views are incredible along with the landscaping.  Note that there are several signs posted about daytime break-ins. Be mindful and secure your vehicle and possessions.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>These tiled steps are an amazing sight to see. The steps themselves are colorful and interesting. But from the bottom looking up, as a collection, they are beautiful. And from the top, looking down, it's one of the best views in San Francisco.

If you're familiar with the TV show The OA you might recognize these steps.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Name>Natasha Kanhai<//Name><time>1609643312231</time><text>This is a really quaint area to visit.  I have lived in another part of the city for 25+ years and never knew about this spot!  The neighborhood has really outdone themselves with the artistic tiles and beautiful greenery.  The stairs weren't too crowded when we went.  There is a fantastic view from the top where you can see all the way to the Pacific Ocean!  I'll admit that its a bit of a climb so I wanted to remove my mask to catch my breath upon reaching the top!  I kept my distance as I did, I promise.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Great place to visit. Great view on a sunny day like we had. Beautiful steps. And you get in your exercise. Up on top you have a great panoramic view of The City.<//text>

Worth a walk up. Nice views on Sunset District and the artistic styling of the stairs are a great reward.< /Review>

So cool, So beautiful. Amazing mosaic art. Mazing view from the bottom and all the way to the top. Clean. Will be back to share with family and friends when they can come and visit. A absolute must see while in San Francisco.<//Review>

Beautiful although very dark and steep at night. Would be cool if they put some lights on the railings for safety and so that you could see the murals.<//Text>

Started in 2003 and completed in 2005, this was a neighbor guided by two artists. It is truly a work of art. Surrounding the steps are beautifully cared for gardens. This used to be a hidden wonder in the city, but word is out and it gets a bit busy. Very hard to find a moment to get a photo of the whole set of stairs empty of people. Very worth coming here. Oh, and when you are at the top of the steps, go a little further to the Grand View Lookout...beautiful views.

Remember this is a residential neighbourhood and be sure to be respectful.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Pretty cool place. Very clean and picture worthy. Gave 4 starts only because you gotta be VERY CAREFUL with your car.  They smash windows very often there. There's even a sign at the beggining of the stairs warning g you about it. Just dont leave anything of value in sight on your car.<//Text>< response>

<Text>Beautiful concept of stairs at public place. We enjoyed it very much. Cactus garden around staircase is also amazing. Not much rush. Careful in parking to avoid theft. Must visit place in San Francisco. Tiles concept is also well thought, the Sun - The Moon - water reservoir (sea) , water flow (river), water animals & then land all are beautifully presented<//Text>< Response>

It’s pretty creative considering the time and effort. Keep in mind you are in a residential neighborhood so noise levels low and parking is kind of tight.<//Review>< pictures>

<Time>1557022412973</Time><rating>4< /rating><review>Beautiful staircase with absolutely stunning mosaics. I arrived here early and was able to really enjoy the beautiful artwork. The view allows for a great view of the ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge. You can tell that the area and gardens are definitely well maintained. There are plenty of signs around the area about high instances of theft which is unnerving as a tourist but it's a risk you need to decide you want to take.< /review>< pics>

Beautiful concept of stairs at public place. We enjoyed it very much. Cactus garden around staircase is also amazing. Not much rush. Careful in parking to avoid theft. Must visit place in San Francisco. Tiles concept is also well thought, the Sun - The Moon - water reservoir (sea) , water flow (river), water animals & then land all are beautifully presented< /text>

<Text>16th Avenue Tiled Steps is easily one of the best free activities to do in San Francisco, especially to catch a sunset. The steps and view at the top were unbelievable! Go see for yourself and you will not be disappointed, especially on a clear sunny day!<//Text>< Pictures>

Nice place to visit if you have an extra time in San Francisco. Not a must visit though.

Do spare an extra time to explore the park at the top of the stairs. Haven't explore it myself, however, seems like it may have nice view of San Francisco.</text>

<Review>Definitely a tourist attraction, but it wasn't too busy when I went. Quite a bit of stairs to climb up the top, however it's a nice view of some of the city & ocean. (Also, the hill just above it had a very stunning view of the city & the Golden Gate Bridge is also visible. Just fyi, its very windy!)

No entrance fee & no restroom facilities nearby, but definitely a gorgeous view.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>These stairs were awesome!  We came here on a Wednesday between rush out and very few people near the stairs and even had them to ourselves for a bit.  These make for a perfect photo opportunity.  Definitely check these out.  At the top you can see a bit of the city.</review>< pictures>

<Text>A beautiful urban hike and location to watch the sunset. Don’t forget your jacket and a scarf. A thermos of something warm with some cookies wouldn’t be a bad idea either.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcWOpdqNFkOOwvKF9pptj8nCP04V4LpkAK5zf_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBxQ07c3cEhn10xVx8e4GtsF8uLKo1ybztftZ0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Definitely one of the hidden gems in San Francisco. Getting here is a challenge since this is located in a residential area, and we want to make sure to not disturb the residents. We went during sunset and there were very few people here. If you can, please climb the stairs because the view at the top is breath taking.< /Review><response>None<//response>< rate>

Tiled Steps - most instagrammable location of the millennial era. This is huge image of the Moon, Sun, Sky, Land, Vegetation, Sea - ocean beings and Sea Vegetation depicted through bits and pieces of colored tiles as a huge image on sets of flights. Enjoy yourselves by coming from the top with the unraveling beautiful stairs of art.</text>

Beautiful!  I love how the art runs across multiple steps, and it's touching to see people's names in the different fish images. Worth visiting.< /review>

<review>Make sure you are comfortable climbing up the stairs! And if you are lazy like my friends, you’ll miss out on a breathtaking view of SF! And if you were able to make it up the tiled steps, don’t miss out on going further up. The view from up there is 10 times better than from the tiled steps! Promise!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Really cool and if you pass the stairs and keep going up you will end up in top of a hill with a great panorama view of most of the city</review></record>

<Review>We will return; this is a wonderful 16th Avenue Tiled Steps, and the staff make it even better! The staff is very friendly and has aided my disabled wife on many occasions.< /Review>< Pics>

I am biased because I live a few blocks from these stairs. The tiles on the steps are beautiful a real piece of art. The views of the ocean are amazing.<//Text>

<Text>A great place for anyone. A huge staircase with a mosaic that ends in a great view of the Pacific Ocean. Be careful if you drive there: daylight burglaries happen often, so keep your valuables with you or hidden well. It's difficult to get a good shot of the mosaic as many other people have the same idea as you.</Text></record>

A very nice place to visit without the crowds of tourists.  And I have found out many San Francisco local people do not know this place.  It is free.  But if you are driving to there, there was a warning of car breaking.<//review>

<review>A very cool art piece hidden in a unique way. The 16th Ave. Tiled Steps not only provide a beautiful piece of artwork to enjoy, but also an incredible west facing view of the Pacific Ocean and the Westside of San Francisco. Well worth a visit and best on a clear sunny day.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLFiuDC1tuaRDkKFhys9C134AHsuldRYftskbZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDCLE8cil0B26WUhfdQr7JoCH7ioXZIgaZ68J0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXKTmHmUznDHQz1cNF9V54klv6ov-W8lIENAkK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMrShah7KuSkrnTLfO8XflYwqC9TnAnvzg7nG-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFU0GiK1VLr3s3vRD9mqMb3xaXkk16P_IgUKE9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPj1cz1rGWqRESCt0ik8FTcBWRp09Zz1PCjnxt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDn8Qv2-b8kO-6TzuTRJaFswbf4j290layqNA9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMFDRSx38VYCX5-YU6EV6Im-U0ZVREwvxvV-9f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This staircase was amazing. It is one of my favorite things we saw during our sightseeing vacation.  Every stair edge was a masterpiece. There were four of us there taking pictures (two of the people were professional photographers) and none of the pictures that any of the four of us took look the same. We could have spent far more time here looking at each of the images from the staircase. This is a must see.  Unfortunately there were signs all over these streets that said car break-ins happen at this location with regularity. So do not leave anything on the seat of your car in order to avoid that!!  There was broken windshield glass curbside in multiple spots.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6cBK-df7S4ytaarWJIUj_myQzEiB3zeB5HENO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ2PRnSebYSETTTYX6HuE_Ki6-iAaaZMgb0Pvo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgKMTzivqt56dZQ-NFonMeofSumoZrAxIx-amH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt3G6otZpbfuKlf2K1QlBJHf3bHJ6biottR-33=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvGKebmZw0FTXRXscyi6OhjLOTRXxxsKJCGrli=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH2U1UNDVWhAsU0V16o3SezuXU65q-3mznUf9C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwWW9C_PExkx0X5uo3b1LQs6b6HgbyXQZyw72J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtm7-iCZm7pcky12gAr9QygT-avaGdAUV6DSvw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing place to visit! Everyone was wearing masks, the steps were very beautiful. We had no theft problems during our visit. Highly recommend visiting. Be sure to check out the Secret Garden steps if you are interested.< /Text>

<review>Beautiful!  I love how the art runs across multiple steps, and it's touching to see people's names in the different fish images.

Very nice tiled steps. Pretty high! But at the top take the extra stairs to the park for an amazing view!< /Review>

<text>This is an incredibly artistic stairway. I live in the city. I’m very proud of all the work that the Sunset community had done to contribute it to our city. Thank you!  The Mosaic Stairway somehow reminded me The Starry Night of Vincent Van Gogh in 1889. And it’s as I’ve said INCREDIBLE!!! ❤️</text><time>1597095213239</time><Name>T squared<//Name><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

Really cool and if you pass the stairs and keep going up you will end up in top of a hill with a great panorama view of most of the city< /review>

It’s a very touristy spot, but with reason. Not only are the steps gorgeous and so interesting to look at all the details of, the views are impeccable. You get to see the ocean, the golden gate park, and even a glimpse of the bridge in the distance. If you go all the way up, you’ll find overlook park which is yet another climb, but it allows you to see a 360 view of San Fran. Even the downtown area far away!</review>

<Review>One of the best lookouts in the city. Walking up the steps can be pretty tiring but rest assured that the views of the Sunset District backdropped by the foggy shores of the Pacific Ocean are well worth the climb. For the best views, come near sunset. A bit of a warning: there is nowhere to leave your bike, meaning you may have to carry your bike up the stairs (like I did) to ensure it doesn't get stolen at the bottom - apparently thievery is a problem in the area.< /Review>< Name>

I gave it a 4 star because the view was great, and I'm sure it took a great amount of time to get that stair way done. I just thought it was over rated. The view from the top is to die for. Parking was easy and fast. I drive a 2500 Dodge Ram 4 door king cab 4/4. Easily found parking for it.< /review>

Each flight of stairs features a different theme, so you can really climb up and down and find the one that's your best photo op. A couple more flights upward and there's a hill that lets you see over Golden Gate Park and the surrounding area.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>These steps are gorgeous. I love how the scene moves from the sea, to the earth, to the night sky, to the sun. The walk isn't too strenuous, either. You definitely need to be ambulatory and in fairly descent shape to get all the way up, but I feel like a spry 5 or 6 year-old could handle it easily. There isn't somewhere to sit and chill after the climb or something like a park to hang out in; these are literally just really pretty tiled steps in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Street parking is fairly easy in the area, especially if you have a smaller car.<//Review>< username>

< Review>
This staircase was amazing. It is one of my favorite things we saw during our sightseeing vacation.  Every stair edge was a masterpiece. There were four of us there taking pictures (two of the people were professional photographers) and none of the pictures that any of the four of us took look the same. We could have spent far more time here looking at each of the images from the staircase. This is a must see.  Unfortunately there were signs all over these streets that said car break-ins happen at this location with regularity. So do not leave anything on the seat of your car in order to avoid that!!  There was broken windshield glass curbside in multiple spots.</Review>

A nice little spot to visit, located in a residential neighborhood with not much else nearby. It's very popular, so if you manage to park, watch out for break in's. There are also signs warning people about this. You might have to wait a bit to get a solo shot, as there are always people walking up and down, but the view from the top is amazing and the staircase is gorgeous (especially during sunset).<//text>

<review>A great place for anyone. A huge staircase with a mosaic that ends in a great view of the Pacific Ocean. Be careful if you drive there: daylight burglaries happen often, so keep your valuables with you or hidden well. It's difficult to get a good shot of the mosaic as many other people have the same idea as you.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOns_tEWg7npCMITkUKFLzxvKGdgbj1Gs0cH63R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Beautiful display of tile art. Making it up all the stairs is a chore, but worth it as you can admire the tile work all the way up.

This is a beautiful location and a good workout! These steps were built by the community and it is a treasure ❤️. The mosaic starts from the sea, and goes all the way to the starts. The colors are vibrant and the design is magical. It is also cool to see the names of the contributors on the steps. Once you get to the top, you get a gorgeous view of the ocean and Golden Gate Park.< /Review>

<Text>The stairs were beautiful but the experience sucked! We weren't there for ten minutes and got the back window of our car knocked out and camera stolen, and what was funny is that no one saw a thing and the guy in the van was parked right behind our car, the van belonged to Applied video solutions of San Francisco California.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>A nice walk along raised road from mosaic steps and beautiful houses leads to the tiled steps from the main tram along the road. The best place for sunsets with a view of the vast and panaromic Pacific ocean, houses arranged in a beautiful array descending to the beach and roads that demarcate and hive pattern to the already amazing view. The tiled steps are beautiful in themselves and offer some great golden hour shots.< /Review><time>1564843130946< /time>< user_name>

Really cool spot to visit. Lots of young tourist from the east trying to snap selfies, which gets annoying. Hard to get any good pics with out a duck face in the background. Parking is tuff as always in San Fran. The hills are steep so make sure you use your parking brake! Make the hike to the top, great views 360°. Remember, there are private residence all around so be respectful!<//review>

I loved it! I think its a must stop if you visit San Francisco. It was on the way to our hotel... you don't have to stay long and parking was pretty easy... there are signs that say to not leave valuables in the car while you visit the steps.. just an fyi. Lovely pictures! And there is a nice view at the top.. when there isn't fog< /Text>

Really cool spot to stop at for a photo, but that’s pretty much it. You do get a great view of the city from the top, but it’s always crowded. People are nice enough to let you get your picture before getting in your way. Took us longer to get here than the time spent on the steps, but still really cool< /review>

Another location for mosaic steps. This seemed to be much more popular and you can definitely tell because of the burglary signs posted all over. The signs tell you to beware of people breaking into your car while you are checking the tiled steps.

This place wasn't that busy, so it was easy to get photos without anyone else on the steps. People seemed to be nice about it by waiting at the bottom to let everyone get their shots in. Just know that you'd be waiting for people to go up and down the entire stairway before you'd get a clear shot.

Found parking around kirkham.< /text>

Great place to look at and take a picture of but trying to get a picture without anyone on  the steps is difficult. I got the clearest I could get just a family in the middle around 2pm but there were people coming and going the whole time. I would say come early in the morning to get a clear picture or head to the Hidden Garden Steps down the road it is a lot quieter.<//Text>

<Review>Worthwhile stop in San Francisco. This is not a huge tourist attraction - just some decorated steps in an otherwise normal neighborhood. Park your car on the street, walk up, enjoy the views of SanFra and the water from the top.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWQ5drGQCr0efOD5YwLjlqX8X3QYM5TFXXfoFj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Very cool installation.  Be prepared to hike if you want to go to the top, it is a haul.  I hiked to the tip top of the hill (which is actually over double the tiled steps) carrying a stroller and a 2 year old and, needless to say, I was winded.  Well worth the visit though, there is an amazing view from the top (both the top of the steps and the top of the hill).< /text>< rating>

Beautiful views from the top. Additional steps will take you to the top of the hill where there is a swing. Swing was broke when we were there though. Got there right before sundown.</Review>

Lovely place, go during the sunset time for a jaw dropping view. Pro tip: climb up the stairs above for an even higher and better views of the shore line and SF city.

Very beautiful steps. Every flight of steps has its own picture. It is amazing to climb up the stairs and to enjoy the colorful tiled pictures.

When you get up, you can enjoy the picturesque view of the ocean and San Francisco as a reward. The best time to take great photos here is before sunset.<//review>

Really cool spot to stop at for a photo, but that’s pretty much it. You do get a great view of the city from the top, but it’s always crowded. People are nice enough to let you get your picture before getting in your way. Took us longer to get here than the time spent on the steps, but still really cool< /Review>

Nothing too special so I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to see these. However, if you are in the area they are fun and the views from the top expansive. Just beware that there are multiple signs around the bottom warning of thefts from any cars left unattended. The stories I heard suggest that this is serious!< /text>

Amazing place, we have had the opportunity to get there during our last stop in San Francisco, the view from the top are simply amazing, also, is good to see the old ladies keeping everything clean, they use to be there during the day, I love it, we got there by bus which is the best and cheapeast way.<//Review>

This is a beautiful location and a good workout! These steps were built by the community and it is a treasure ❤️. The mosaic starts from the sea, and goes all the way to the starts. The colors are vibrant and the design is magical. It is also cool to see the names of the contributors on the steps. Once you get to the top, you get a gorgeous view of the ocean and Golden Gate Park.</Review>

<Review>I loved it! I think its a must stop if you visit San Francisco. It was on the way to our hotel... you don't have to stay long and parking was pretty easy... there are signs that say to not leave valuables in the car while you visit the steps.. just an fyi. Lovely pictures! And there is a nice view at the top.. when there isn't fog</Review>< Pics>

Beautiful little piece of nature in a residential area. Encourage visitors to not just stop at the steps but go all the way up. The view is beautiful.< /review>

Unfortunately this spot is missing in many guided tours and travel guides. Nevertheless it is worth a stop. The steps go up to the Grand View park from where you have an amazing view on the Pacific, the Golden Gate park and Twin Peaks.< /text>

This is a cool place and it's quick to visit, you don't need a lot of time. Just go there because it's open 24/7, it's not like a business or anything, it's a public stairway. And after that you can go up to the top of the park, it's like a second Twin Peaks.</Review>

Nice off-the-beaten path sight to see. Stairs are beautiful, as is the garden planted along the hill. Striking views to the west.</Review>

<review>Cool spot to stop at for a photo, but that’s pretty much it. You do get a great view of the city from the top, but it’s always crowded. People are nice enough to let you get your picture before getting in your way. It took us longer to get here than the time spent on the steps, but still really cool.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

This is a really nice artwork worth to stop by if you happen to have some time (consider that parking is reaaaaally easy and free in this area).

There are a series of multiple stairs, all decorated with beautiful and shiny mosaic. The artwork is pretty easy to get: the lowest stairs picture the sea and as you climb them, the mosaic pictures higher and higher elements: ground, sky, space, moon and sun.

It is a bit crowdy, so quite difficult to take pics of the stairs themselves, but still good to appreciate the artwork.

The view from the top is awesome, especially if you take the time to also visit the small park right after, on the top of the hill. That's why I belive that perfect time to visit that place would be sunset or sunrise (probably sunrise is better if you want to avoid the crowd, but I can't tell as I visited it during sunset).<//Review>

You can define a community by the shared attributes of the people in it and/or by the strength of the connections among them. You need a bunch of people who are alike in some way, who feel some sense of belonging or interpersonal connection.</text>

Super cool steps with a fantastic view. Free street parking.

Be very, very careful leaving stuff within view in your car.  Another car was broken into in the five minutes we were there, and it was broad daylight 9:30 in the morning.</review>

This is one of my favorite places to go for my walks in the morning. It's like paradise,  seeing all the beautiful succulents alongside the steps and then being able to capture the view at the very top! When you get to the top of the mosaic steps, cross the street and walk to the right to climb the rest of the steps to an amazing 360 view of the city!<//text>

You do have to climb these stairs though to fully appreciate the magnitude of this art piece. I highly recommend starting from the bottom and go up. We got dropped off on the top of the stairs and had to climb down and then back up again (legs were burning). However, it did give us the time to really look at the different patterns in the mosaic and notice all the smaller details! Some of the tiles even have writing on them!< /text><user>113565429995189369457< /user>< user_name>

Very beautiful steps. Every flight of steps has its own picture. It is amazing to climb up the stairs and to enjoy the colorful tiled pictures.

When you get up, you can enjoy the picturesque view of the ocean and San Francisco as a reward. The best time to take great photos here is before sunset.< /review>

<text>Nothing too special so I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to see these. However, if you are in the area they are fun and the views from the top expansive. Just beware that there are multiple signs around the bottom warning of thefts from any cars left unattended. The stories I heard suggest that this is serious!<//text>< rating>

Gorgeous! Great views! It's the sets of stairs to get to the to, but even from the bottom, the view of the ocean is lovely. The gardens along the tiled stairs are super sweet, with many unusual succulents, most of which are labeled. Beware: there are signs throughout the neighborhood warning of car break ins.</Text>

<Review>Lovely steps, good for photos but generally crowded. Have to wait a lot to take a good picture. Parking was easy to find as well. Got street parking almost next to steps. Good place for photographers too as it's not that famous spot in San Francisco.</Review><userid>117556052257243471998< /userid><rating>5<//rating>< user_name>

<Text>Not a must-see, but if you have time and want to take a break from the hustle and bustle this is a great spot to come and enjoy the art in a quiet residential area. Not too many tourists there when I visited. Very picturesque with many small gardens alongside the steps.<//Text><Time>1558651500096</Time>< user>

The best part is the view overlooking the city and Pacific water.
As to the mosaic tiles, it's actually quite small and not so impressive. Good thing is it's not crowded and quite easy to park.
Not bad to swing by if you are nearby, but to me  it's worthy to go out of your way.< /Text>

Definitely worth checking out - beautifully done.  Additional step at the top and to the right.  You can continue all the way to a small park on top of the bluff with amazing views.  Plan for a clear day of possible and wear shoes for climbing and a wind breaker.</Text>

The steps were beautiful. They were very colorful and the surrounding plants were stunning. There were many succulents and vibrant flowers. You can see the whole city and the ocean from the top. Parking was very easy to find, but there are supposedly many daytime burglars around the area.< /text>

Amazing place... You get breath taking views from the bottom of the stairs and as you climb the stairs the view only gets better. At the top, you are rewarded with sweeping views of the Sunset district with a cool fresh air breeze. Walk another block up and walk up another 100+ flight of stairs and the view gets better; you can see part of the golden gate bridge.

Be forewarned that the neighbors here are very respectful of their neighborhood so please keep it clean and don't steal the plants! Also this is a tourist attraction so keep your valuables out of sight.< /Review>

<date>1510466007592<//date><rating>5</rating><review>This is a hidden gem in the middle of a residential neighborhood. It's a community inspired effort, which came together to sponsor handmade animal mosaic tiles. A friend told me about the tiles and since then, I've brought others to take in the stunning handiwork. If you get to the top, you'll be rewarded with beautiful views of the city. Best pictures of the tiles can be taken during the day, but the sunset provides a scenic view. Either way, you won't be disappointed!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed< /GmapID></record>

Beautiful! A great view when you reach the top, however, this place is really a residential place. So parking could be difficult. Try to be quiet so don’t bother the neighbors<//text>

All you can do here is walk up and down the steps and take pictures...but there works of art are something to appreciate!</Text>

It's fun to find all the tiles steps around the city! These ones are beautiful and the paintings on the steps are very admirable. It's great that the city allows to beautify the stairs and parks that pedestrians and tourists use every day. It creates a sense of artistry and comfort in walking around the city<//review>

A new tourist spot; getting popular.  You might wanna just take a look if you don't wanna get too tired.

But, if you go upstairs, you'll be able to see good views around.

There is not much room for parking; only street parking along sidewalks.< /Text>

Definitely worth checking out - beautifully done.  Additional step at the top and to the right.  You can continue all the way to a small park on top of the bluff with amazing views.  Plan for a clear day of possible and wear shoes for climbing and a wind breaker.<//text>

Definitely a better experience for you to start from the top and admire the view. After you've taken it in, walk to the bottom and turn around to be amazed by the art!< /review>

Definitely worth a visit! Loved the vista from up top with the mountainous terrain on the right and the gorgeous blues of Pacific Ocean spanning the length of the horizon. If you're still on the fence as to whether to go as I was, I hope you decide to add this to your list of places in SF to visit! It went beyond my expectations and I'm glad I went!< /text>

After 5 trips to SF, I finally made it to these tiled steps on my 6th trip. Honestly not the most photogenic spot, wouldn't call it a must-do if you're visiting the city for the first time. But swing by if you have nothing better to do! Great view<//review>

It's a nice place to visit only if you are nearby. There isn't so much to do there. From the top you will have a nice view.<//review>

Interesting if you're into that kind of thing, otherwise a great view from the top.

If you are in the area you should make your way by Golden Gate Park that is an awesome spot<//text>

<Text>Remember, there's more than just one!

If you're like me and can't "relax" on a vacation, this is one little adventure that will certainly keep you on your feet and work those leg muscles. San Francisco's secret mosaic staircase is an exciting mini adventure that will kill about an hour or two of your day depending on how quick you move and how many of the steps you're looking to see. Not only are you going to see some amazing views of the city, you'll also get to take in the beauty of tile art as the flowing mosaic runs up 163 steps and swirls around for even more steps that lead up to Grand View Park.

Now, there's a few steps to take in all the steps that are accounted for with this escapade as most people only come for the middle steps on 16th Avenue (between Noriega St. & Moraga St.). But there is also another flight of stairs from the 15th Avenue Steps Park (corner of Kirkham St. and 15th Ave.). It's only a 5 minute walk between the two and the 15th Avenue Steps Park is certainly less crowded though overlooked I would guess since it's all under the shade of the trees and doesn't shine quite as bright.  These of course steer you to Grand View Park which offers massive views of the city and Golden Gate Park. All are definitely a hidden gem worth seeking out and conquering, plus it's another completely free escape from the city. Be sure to shout down upon the San Franciscans below.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Definitely worth a visit! Loved the vista from up top with the mountainous terrain on the right and the gorgeous blues of Pacific Ocean spanning the length of the horizon. If you're still on the fence as to whether to go as I was, I hope you decide to add this to your list of places in SF to visit! It went beyond my expectations and I'm glad I went!</review>

A new tourist spot; getting popular.  You might wanna just take a look if you don't wanna get too tired.

But, if you go upstairs, you'll be able to see good views around.

There is not much room for parking; only street parking along sidewalks.< /text>

<Review>A must visit for any tourist. Go up the stairs to the peak of the hill to overlook the beautiful city of San Francisco. From the very top you can overlook the Golden Gate Bridge, golden gate park, downtown, etc. I will take a star off because it will be busy as times, so pictures can be hard to take.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This is a neat and easy to get to location...the tiles are very pretty and the steps are not overly difficult to climb to the top. From the top of the steps, you have a beautiful view of the city and the ocean on a clear day.  There was a lot of warnings from local residents about thieves breaking into parked cars so it's a good idea not to have any valuables visible in your cars when parked.<//Review>

Beautiful, but now very popular with tourists. There are other tiled steps in the area that are less popular, and equally beautiful. I find the stairs secondary to the amazing view from the top of the hill.< /Review>

<review>Parking is fairly easy to find although on weekends it may be a more than a block away since this is a residential neighborhood. If you come to visit the steps, don't forget to also climb up the subsequent set of stairs to the neighborhood park/view point once you're at the top of the Tiled Steps. The next set of stairs leads to a vista points with amazing panoramic views of SF.<//review>< pictures>

Beautiful mosaics and very beautiful garden next to the steps.  Luckily it's not too crowded for now though I can imagine if it gets as famous as Lombard street the residence in the area might not be too happy about it.  So do remember to respect that it is still a neighborhood.  Beautiful view of SF skyline.</text>

It is just another amazing thing about SF that will make you fall in love with the city over and over again. These steps are a staple attraction of SF and is easily one of the best. I can spend all day admiring the artwork on these steps. It's directly next to the Grand View Park so I like to take the tiled steps up to the great views of the park.< /review>< Pics>

I like to walk up the stairs and walk a little bit more toward the Grand View Park.
With a clear sky, you can see the whole San Francisco town from Golden Gate Bridge to Financial district.
it's quite windy at the grand view park, be sure to bring a jacket with you even it's summer day.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This hidden treasure is located in a residential area in San Francisco. It does get crowded here with the workout groups and the tourists so just be prepared to dodge the runners and people taking pics.

If its not too busy, take the time to appreciate each individual tiled step. Its so creative and if you are into art, you will love it.

At the top of the stairs, if its not too foggy, you will catch an amazing view. Definitely worth the climb!

Great workout, great photo op, this is a must see in San Francisco!<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was hesitant at first but my wife wanted to go and I'm glad we did. The steps are super intricate and beautiful to see. Also, given the location, it's not nearly as crowded as other tourist spots in San Francisco. A short walk from the top of the steps you can also find some great views of downtown, Golden Gate Bridge and the ocean.</Text>

Great spot to visit in San Francisco. The tiled stairs are amazing & the view at the top is gorgeous. While there were a number of people around, it wasn’t too crowded and the walk to the top 100% worth it.< /Review>

I absolutely loved this location. The tiles were beautiful, and it was such a fun experience to walk up and down them. My husband and I also walked around Grandview Park while we visited the steps, this certainly added more loveliness to our day.<//text>

Really cool spot, one of those nice little pieces of public art that you show to any friends or family or just visitors from out of town.

It is exactly what the description says they are "Tiled Steps" and the tile pieces makeup nice pieces of art that range from the sun to the moon and the stars. It's about 6 flights of vertical stairs.

From the top of the stairs you won't see the art, it's not until you walk down the first flight of stairs do you see the big picture :)

Again, really awesome spot, it might be a little hard to find but as long as you have Google maps you'll be able to find it.<//text>

Sketchy people on the stairs really ruined the moment for us. They wanted us to take a pic of them and we did but then they offered to take a pic of us... we said no, then heard them ask the next couple the same thing. They were definitely targeting us tourists!! We gotta stick together!!

The steps were cool, go to the top, hang a right, and you can continue to go higher up wooden stairs to the top of the city!! Pretty cool spot</Text>

<Review>One of the greatest views in San Francisco!

After trying to find this place for a while now, my friends and I finally got to come here. Parking wasn't a problem for us when we went. We conveniently found one literally across the street.

It was also perfect when we went because there wasn't a lot of people so we were able to take some great pictures. The steps were a workout but that's totally fine! On top of the stairs, you could see Moraga clearly and the beach.

It was definitely a breathtaking experience with an awesome view and I highly suggest coming here.< /Review>< Date>

After reaching the top of the stairs, if you would to go further up for an even better view, walk up the street and climb another flight of stairs (wooden) to Grandview Park.<//Review>< user_id>

Loved the view and great picture opportunities.  I parked right in front on the down hill slope so I was able to see my car at all times.  It wasn't busy at all and must be due to the weather and it was a Sunday. One of the many free places to visit and free parking. Most parking in San Francisco is $3.50 an hour.<//Text>

<review>Just as I imagined. I've been wanting to cross this off my "places to visit" list for some time. We took an uber from BART. Ended up walking up a hill before we found the stairs. The views are wonderful!

The sun sets directly across from the steps. So the artwork is illuminated by it. Incredible piece of art this is. And a great work out to walk up and down.

If you haven't come to see these steps yet, I hope you find your way here soon!</review>< Pics>

Beautiful staircase with many details. The hill is not too steep which makes it not too hard to climb</Review>

Nice spot for taking in views of the city. The steps are dedicated to various families within the neighborhood. Some kids set up a lemonade stand at the bottom of the steps. Most lucrative lemonade stand ever.<//text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Hidden attraction not listed in any major tourist forum or pamphlet. Started out as a local spot, getting more popular now. Parking isnt bad for a quick visit, neighbors street only, no parking structure. Beware of leaving valuables in the car as break ins are common, even during the day time. Expect to spend 30 minutes of you are coming the stairs and the hill for the view. Can be difficult to get a picture of just the stairs as people tend to take their timing climbing it, expect to have other people in your photos.< /Text>< Pics>

<Time>1467048174697< /Time><text>*NOTE: You'll have to look for street parking in the neighborhood.

*TIP: Climb up past the stairs (to more stairs) and to the top of the hill. The view from there is pretty amazing. Be sure to wear a windbreaker; it's colder and more windy at the top.

PRO:
+ The stairs are well done with colorful mosaics.
+ Gorgeous view of the city and ocean. Picturesque angles at any point of the steps: bottom, middle, and top.

CON:
- It can get crowded, so snapping a good photo can be tricky.
- They are steps on a steep incline.
- Personally, I don't think it's worth going out of your way to visit.<//text>< rating>

<Review>One of the last places we visited in SF, definitely worth the time to go. Beautiful. The only thing that I saw that was disconcerting were the more than a dozen signs warning you about locking your car doors because of the amount of car robberies that take place during the daytime in the area. Other than that, it was really cool.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1467060948101< /Time></record>

Cool, but not life changing. Also, dangerously slippery when it slightly wet after a rain. I'd say the views at the top of the steps are actually even more worth it. (When you're at the top of the tiled steps, look to the right a bit to find another set of stairs, go up those, and then look slightly right again to find the last flight of stairs)<//text>

I've gone here over and over again for the great views of the city. There are two routes to the top of the steps, one the tiled steps and two the steps you hit when approaching the area from kirkham/ Lawton. You can hike all the way to the top past the stairs for dual bay and ocean views</review>

<Review>Very nice steps.
Off the beaten path tourist must do.
Busy and at times, hard to take pictures as everyone else is.
Parking isn't bad, going further after the steps is another park.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80858761c278b065:0x3d5b0419554cd6ed< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you're a tourist and have found these steps, great job. This is one of the true little gems that most miss...
There are approx 164 steps....I tried counting exactly, but I obviously miscounted because I got different numbers...dummy me!
Anyway, it's a nice little workout heading up the stairs.
Oh, once at the top, continue on to Grandview Park for some of the best views of SFO.
Yes, a 'few' more stairs to climb but certainly worth it....I promise ;-)
Also, check out some of the pics from the other reviewers...they are pretty good.
Have fun!!!</text>

Good place for a view on a clear day. The steps are pretty and if I remember correctly each tile had a meaning to it.

Be aware, there are signs warning visitors of car thefts.</text>

Really cool place to visit if you're in San Francisco. Park on 16th Street and admire the tiled steps, and then climb the 163 steps to admire the view from the top!

Also, you can climb farther up to the Grand View Park. The view of the city from there is pretty impressive!< /Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Nothing special about this place. It's a long staircase covered in bathroom tiles. The tiles on the vertical part of each steps have been decorated with tiles San Francisco style. It's home made. Be careful when, especially when descending those steps, as the neighborhood is often wet in the fog, and the steps become very slippery. The nice aspect about this place is that it's a nice break from this car-run city as it's only for pedestrians (of course). Otherwise not worth the detour.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

This place is so cool, you can either look down to get the view of the city all the way to the sea, or look up to the amazing mosaic steps. The only problem is there might be other people like you stepping into your photo.</Review>

<review>It is tucked away in the midst of small streets and difficult terrible parking.The stairs itself is quite spectacular. Very creative and beautiful and I have to give mad props and lots of respect to the artists and creators. Beautiful place for photo opps. However many try to do photo shoots here and it can be difficult when you get in the way of their shoot. There's nothing they can do about it since it is a public place.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Wonderful piece of artwork and within walking distance from Grandview Park (which I also recommend visiting because of the beautiful panoramic views). If you are hiking down, please note going back up is quite a hike, so bring water! I would recommend visiting if you have time in San Francisco. It won't take too long to look.< /Text>

Easy enough to get there by public transportation, beautiful view from the base, middle, and top of the stairs. Plus, the steps are simply a great view of its own.< /Text>

The steps are beautiful and if you climb a little you can have a really nice view. I really enjoyed my time there.</text>

<Date>1506403537024<//Date><Text>Been in the bay area most of my life and I never visited this place until now. Holy moly, this is an amazing display of art! Now getting here can be difficult as the roads are narrow, a specialty of San Francisco. There is quite a few parking spaces available but be wary that since this is a tourist spot, you have a increase of car break ins so do not leave any valuables in plain sight.
Now there is a lot of steps to climb but each step is designed beautifully and there are several designs as you ascend the steps ranging from the ocean, moon and the sun. When you reach the top, if you turn around you are greeted with a bird's eye view of the whole ocean front......assuming it is not foggy.

But wait there's even more! past the hill is even more steps but you can go to the very top of the hill and either swing by the cliff side or even have a better view of almost a 360 view of San Francisco!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Once you get to the top you'll be able to see breath taking 360 views of the Sunset District, Richmond District, Daly City, & Downtown SF! A bit windy so take a coat it gets chilly. Enjoy the view!<//text>

A quick and easy stop for an aesthetic shot for your preferred social media platform. This was a neighborhood beautification project.
Be aware that there are a lot of car break ins around here because they know tourists aren’t on guard in a neighborhood.
Definitely worth the exploration into SF to find the “lesser known” photo spots. (Although you wouldn’t know it’s lesser known thanks to Pinterest and Instagram, lol)
Please be mindful of the people that live here when you’re driving by and parking and taking pictures.</Text>

Very pretty and photogenic staircase you can use to walk up to Grandview Park (at the top of the hill). No public parking, but easy to walk here from the Irving Street business district (and lots of public transit options to get there).<//Text>

Three stars us about right: it's ok to go check it out, especially if it's on your route, but don't have high expectations. You can get to a park above which has some view</text>

<Review>If you're into scenic viewpoints and free local landmarks, you definitely have to check out the 16th Avenue Tiled Steps. This local stairway is located on Moraga Street. Surprisingly, it was not too crowded when we decided to check it out. Definitely a lot easier if you park at the bottom of the steps; that way, you'll get to enjoy the view of the steps before you actually climb them.

Each individual step is already unique in its own way, but when you take the entire staircase in as a whole, all the steps come together seamlessly. It creates a really beautiful picture - very similar to the ebb and flow of the ocean. It's really awesome how there are these beautiful treasures hidden throughout San Francisco - who would have known?

Even better is after you climb the entire staircase, you're able to take in the view of SF from a higher vantage point. If you come around sunset, you'll really be able to see the city view with the soft, warm glow of the sun as it casts a shadow over SF before it becomes engulfed in darkness.

It'll be a bit difficult to get a good picture without anybody blocking the view or intruding in your photo, but it's worth the wait! There seem to be rushes of people to these tourist-y spots, so wait for a chance where the crowd seems to be minimal and grab your opportunity to get that shot!

tl;dr - Highly recommend you check this place out if you're in to scenic things to do in SF! You'll be glad you did.<//Review><userid>111786517743281339317< /userid><Date>1499823928891<//Date>< Pics>

< review>
The steps are beautiful, as is the view from the top. Make it an adventure by visiting Grandview Park, just above the steps, for a panoramic view spanning from downtown to Fort Funston. Then head over to Hidden Garden steps at 16th Ave between Lawton & Kirkham before looping back.</review>

<text>The 16th Avenue Tiled Steps Project (2003) was an artistic endeavor curated by Aileen Barr and Collette Crutcher and executed by community members to beautify the neighborhood.  The project started in January 2003, and the Golden Gate Heights Neighborhood Association and the San Francisco Parks Trust funded it.  In the short time since the mural was created, the surrounding area has become known for car break-ins and other minor crimes. The piece consists of small murals on each stair step, which form a large tiled picture of the sky swirling down into the ocean when viewed from below. There are images of the sun, moon, stars, waves, fish, seashells and more. The mural is made of tiled glass pieces, and at night the steps light up to create a glow-in-the-dark version of the image. In the decade or so since the steps have been installed, crime rates have significantly worsened in the area, partially due to its growing popularity with tourists and vacationers who are unfamiliar with the terrain. The Tiled Steps are an excellent representation of the ways in which displacement and gentrification have changed San Francisco’s political and social environment.

Large parts of the fear surrounding the people who may be likely to steal could be speculation.  In the current fear based climate brought on by media reports and growing distrust based on economic status, the upper class is becoming more likely to call the police before having any probable cause.  This can only lead to further violence committed against minorities who know those spaces as home. Displacement plays a large role in the recent increase in crime; the people who once formed the neighborhoods of San Francisco have begun to be removed from places they called home for decades and replaced with the white upper class that formed the tech boom. None of the spaces created for homeless youth, ethnic centers, or safe spaces for LGBT community members are being saved in the wake of the growingly gentrified new residencies.  With growing tensions and class separations, there are obvious reasons why crime rates would be rising in San Francisco’s current climate. Despite the anger coming from the residents of this neighborhood, they have to admit to their role in the rapidly changing urban environment. Communities tend to form themselves around commonalities, so when historically ethnic neighborhoods are invaded by outsiders unwilling to learn and adapt to that community, homogenization is inevitable.  When white residents move in to a neighborhood for cheap rent or to surround themselves with a specific culture, they fail to realize the effect they have on that environment.  Ethnic and creative communities are being forced onto the streets and treated like outsiders in the places they’ve lived their whole lives.  The growing socioeconomic tension in San Francisco has as much to do with increasing crime rates as the so-called vagrants that are wandering the streets and stealing from tourists. If there weren’t pre-existing frustration and lack of resources for all community members, there wouldn’t be a need for petty theft crimes and loitering in these areas.

Despite the good-naturedness of the creator’s intentions when building the 16th Avenue Tiled Steps Project, the rapidly changing environment of the city overcame the artwork and turned it in to something far more politically charged than they ever could have thought it would be. Community was a large part of the creation and aesthetic decision-making process behind the artwork, but as the meaning of community changes with its surroundings, the steps seemingly cannot withstand their new neighbors. Until there’s a shift in the way community members communicate with each other to deal with problems by focusing on the preservation of culture and safe spaces as opposed to creating an environment of violence and fear, it is unlikely that the steps and their surrounding space will see peace anytime soon.</text>< pics>

<text>Beautiful mosaic steps and if you go up a little further pass the stairs you can hop on the sketchy tree swing.

Lots of signs for car break ins, so be alert and don't leave valuables in the open.< /text><userid>108779889417923863713</userid>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The guided tour we took was frankly interesting, we recommend it. A beautiful walk very pleasant, beautiful corners that are not usually visited by tourists, a wonderful way to visit this less known corner of the city of San Francisco.

Le tour guidé que nous avons pris étaient franchement intéressant, nous le recommandons. Une belle marche très agréable, de beaux coins qui ne sont habituellement pas visités par les touristes, une magnifique façon de visiter ce coin moins connu de la ville de San Francisco.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I think it is run down and not an attractive point.
It is definitely a place that can be skipped.
Even if you pass by you don't even invest time in climbing all the stairs. There are much better places with panoramic views (such as Twin Peaks)

(Original)
Opino que está descuidado y no es un punto atractivo.
Definitivamente es un lugar que puede ser omitido.

(Translated by Google) It will be remembered that there is such a place if there is time. As transportation is by bus, it is recommended to use $ 5 a day ticket (you can also use the subway) with a mobile app. From here you can walk to the Golden Gate Bridge in about 15 minutes by bus number 28 from 19th Ave.

(Original)
時間があればこういう場所もあるんだという事で思い出になります。交通手段はバスになりますので、携帯アプリで一日券5ドル(地下鉄も利用できます)を利用することをお勧めします。ここから少し歩いた19th Aveから28番バスでゴールデンゲートブリッジに15分ほどで行くことができます。<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Superb little walk. The markets rise slowly while admiring the work of mosaic. The succulents all around the staircase are also amazing and the locals even planted little signs with the Latin names on them. Continue to the top, the view is splendid, especially if you are lucky enough to have good weather. Personally I find this view more beautiful on the city than from the twin peaks.

(Original)
Superbe petite promenade. Les marchés se montent lentement le temps d'admirer les travaux de mosaic. Les plantes grasses tout autour de l'escalier sont extraordinaires également et les habitants ont même plante de petites pancartes avec les noms latins dessus. Continuez jusqu'au sommet, la vue est splendide, surtout si vous avez la chance d'avoir du beau temps. Personnellement je trouve ce point de vue plus beau sur la ville que depuis les twin peaks.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I went there during the day, but there was no great inspiration. You can think of it as a tiled staircase in your neighborhood.

<Review>(Translated by Google) 161 steps that seen from the bottom make up colorful designs, more still other wooden steps that lead to the top of the hill from which you can enjoy a fantastic 360 degree view of the city! Many colored tiles, with the design of animals or significant objects, bear the name of the person who donated it. This area of ​​San Francisco is served by the muni line, but there are no bars nearby to recover from the fatigue

161 scalini che visti dal basso compongono variopinti disegni, più ancora altri scalini di legno che portano in cima alla collina da cui si gode una fantastica vista sulla città, a 360 gradi! Molte piastrelline colorate , con il disegno di animali o oggetti significativi, portano il nome della persona che l'ha donata. Questa zona di San Francisco è servita dalla linea muni, ma non vi sono nelle immediate vicinanze bar per riprendersi dalla fatica<//Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Staircase decorated with mosaics. Although they are enough, it does not cost a lot to make the climb, although there are more stairs to take once this is finished, each view offered at the end is excellent.

<review>(Translated by Google) Nice and definitely worth a visit. Attention: on Google Maps the address is given in such a way that one arrives above the stairs and win a few meters later, from there they are not directly visible and through the on the other side high running stairs on dwn vantage point that is a bit confusing.

(Original)
Schön und auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert. Achtung: bei Google Maps ist di Adresse so angegeben, dass man oberhalb der Treppen und win paar Meter dahintwr ankommt, von dort aus sind sie nicht direkt ersichtlich und durch die auf der anderen Seite hoch verlaufenden Treppen auf dwn Aussichtspunkt ist das etwas verwirrend.<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Stairs with a decoration made with mosaics, where a motif is the one you see in each section going up, and a different motif is the one you see going down.
In addition to enjoying the stairs as such, once you reach the top it allows you a view of this impressive part of the city, looking towards the Pacific, Golden Gate Park and if the day is clear you can get to see where the Legion of Honor museum.
Access can be by public transport and from the stop walk some streets

(Original)
Escaleras con una decoración hecha con mosaicos, donde un motivo es el que ves en cada tramo subiendo,  y un motivo diferente es el que ves bajando.
Además de disfrutar las escaleras como tal, una vez que llegaste a su cima te permite una vista de esta parte de la ciudad impresionante, viendo hacia el Pacífico,  el parque Golden Gate y si el día está despejado puedes llegar a ver donde se encuentra el museo de la Legión de honor.
El acceso puede ser por transporte público y de la parada caminar unas calles< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Lovingly decorated staircases with flowerbeds in a quiet neighborhood that invites you to walk.
Unfortunately, the stairs are very difficult to reach in public. For the car but ample parking (at least on weekdays) available.

(Original)
Liebevoll verzierte Stiegen mit Blumenbeeten in einer ruhigen Nachbarschaft die auch zum Spazieren einlädt.
Leider sind die Stiegen öffentlich sehr schlecht zu erreichen. Für das Auto sind aber ausreichend Parkplätze (zumindest wochentags) vorhanden.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) They give it a lot of hype, but it's really nothing from the other world, it struck me that there were signs everywhere warning that we should not leave anything in sight, that we should be very careful, in general it is the most common in the city of San Francisco.

(Original)
Le dan mucho bombo, pero realmente no es nada del otro mundo, me llamó la atención que en todos sitios había carteles avisando que no dejásemos nada a la vista,que debíamos tener mucho cuidado, en general es lo más habitual en la ciudad de San Francisco.<//text>
