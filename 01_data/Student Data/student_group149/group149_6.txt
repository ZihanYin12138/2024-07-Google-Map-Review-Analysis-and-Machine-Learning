< Review>
So, I had my appointment time. I showed up on time but the lady who braids hair hadn't finished her last appointment! she asked me to come back in an hour. (I drove all the way from Santa Cruz to San Jose to get my hair braided by her)  I was like, "great! what do I do in San Jose for an hour?"
Anyways, when it got time for me to get my hair braided, the lady is awesome! she's fast! she's good and I would recommend her to anybody! just be sure that you schedule an appointment and and have something to do just in case!!!</Review>

If you need SINGLES DO NOT GO HERE. Ninja botched up/CUT MY HAIR to the EXTREME. the pictures are proof. She knew she had jacked up my hair. After she had finished my singles (got the weirdest vibe off her).When I got home to take a closer look, I noticed she had end my braids way......sooner, my hair was a lot longer than where she ended the braids.

MY HAIR has NEVER been this short, it’s ridiculous.
Because of her, I am going to have to spend 2 years worth of money, thousands of dollars to fix her mess, it’s so not right.

MESSAGE FOR NINJA: To refresh you memory on who I am, I was there when the media accidentally put Patty Labels picture up instead of Aretha Franklin’s picture, when she had passed (you knew the family); older lady talking to us, she gave me an Avon magazine. To refresher you memory even more, the talkative lady with her little girl came in asking if you had anything sooner over the phone and when she came in. May Jehovah God through his son Christ Jesus name rebuke you if you deny this.

The pictures below show NOW and BEFORE. I can’t stress enough how my hair has never looked liked this. How does a person cut that much off your hair.

My kids and my husband see me cry, it’s just not morally right.< /text>

I went to this place with the hopes of getting some maintenance on my dreads, when I got there the customer service was good, but the final product not so much, that is why I give her  3 stars. I asked specifically that I wanted crochet but I got interlocks... it seems as tho it was the fastest option preferred for her convenience. Not even crochet after an interlock, my new lock need that. Instead, she would cut the loose ends.... I won’t come back here anymore.<//Review>

Came in for a protective style and decided on crocheted locs. Ninja took me through the shop and helped me decide what hair would work best and we got right to it. Great hair care educator and fun, easy conversation. NO wait. AND she was finished in no time flat. I've had these locs nearly 8wks; they still look great. I'm definitely going to be a regular and look forward to my next appt in a couple weeks.<//Text>

<Text>I went in to get Dutch pigtails I walked in I automatically felt super uncomfortable. She's super quick, in work! Overall I'm impressed with my braids she did a fabulous job.  But $65 dollars was a lot just for Dutch pigtails. I only paid the $65 because I need to get them done for a special event.<//Text>< Pics>

I got a Conroe style and it was insanely overpriced. I liked the braids but will never go again because it simply was not worth the $$$.</Text>

<review>The environment was peaceful but for my first time..I think it was ok! For 1. the price is way too high! (Especially for the job quality I recieved) At 1st she started at 220 then jumped to 265..cuz I brought my own hair n it was 24" only had 240 so thats what I paid..I dnt really care so much bout the price off top cuz ill pay to slay..but real talk my braids were mediocre if I'm going to drop almost 3bills my hair shouldnt be poking out almost every braid..I can understand 1 or 2 but 15-to most no I know for a fact from people who have had it my braids should have blended n sealed with extensions.truly I was sadly disappointed n believe when i say more hair has came out n its barely been 5dyz smh well lesson learned this type of profession needs patience and quality which I feel as though I got neither..too rushed ya we all need money but u want customers to come back honey..I deff dont recommend in my opinion also not enough personality!!!! Jst godbless her though😉<//review>< Pictures>

Regardless, again I want to apologize that we didn't leave you with the best first impression.

I really like the set-up: nice, clean, bright. Everything is either hanging or shelved, and the cashier is extremely helpful. I will definitely be back. And recommend to others.< /text>

<Text>Great customer service.  You can now buy your dmv tags from them. You can also complete other dmv services at an extra cost, but well worth it saving you time. Don't forget to use their on-line coupon.<//Text>< pictures>

I needed to get my smog done and I found Crown Smog on the net.

I called and they told me to come in.  It took less than 15 minutes to do the smog on my car.  Vanessa was the technician and she was great.  She told me the process and asked to walk into the office.  While I was going into the office she hooked up my car with the machine.

She scanned my DMV renewal letter and license.  I was going to sit down but she said “You are done”.  Wow, quick service and nice employees.  I got my paperwork and the machine communicates with the DMV to inform them of my car passing.  Quick and easy!

Crown Smog also does DMV work. I wish they were around when the DMV was the only place to go.

I recommend Crown Smog to anyone seeking a smog certificate or DMV work.< /text>

<review>Glad I came here on a recommendation. No appointment needed and no long wait lines. I was in and out in less than 20 min. I think his name was Zed. He helped me and got the job done quickly, passed the smog test. This location is a STAR approved for smog. Location entrance is on the main street, but don't miss it, it looks like an alleyway. Small waiting room with chairs.<//review></record>
</dataset><record>
<Review>Out of the four places I called yesterday morning, I picked Crown Smog because of the price, $30, (which I could not believe still exists).  Also, Z's sense of humor and patience in answering questions (making sure that there are no hidden charges, etc.), he then said, If you want I can make it $40.00."  Clean place and seemed organized.  Literally, I was there for less than 10 minutes!  I am definitely going back to him and will highly recommend this place to everyone.<//Review><Time>1549551505209<//Time>< pictures>

I've been there every 2 years for the past 10 or more years when I'm required to get a smog test and I'm always in and out of there within 20 to 30 minutes, maximum. The owner is a friendly, very nice fellow. I recommend this place if you need to get your car tested.< /text>

The guy that does the service is great however the owner not that great went there to get a smog check that I didn't  need but they gave me one any way never said nothing like you don't have to get one this year. I had just bought the car. They took my money then didnt even offer to give it back  when I called to tell them...they suck!! and then to make things worse they advertises $19.99 but they charge additional $10.00 for the paper certificate SMDH...robbers<//Text>

This place is a little shady.  I was quoted one price on the phone and when I arrived the man assisting me tried to charge me double.  When I questioned the price, quickly pulling out the digital  coupon from my smartphone, he quickly changed the price by lower it by 50% so be careful.  As far as the service provided, it was done quickly and professionally.< /Text>

<Time>1531604982093< /Time><rate>1</rate><review>There was some kind of glitch with his computer that caused my car to fail.  The car only has 48K mile, only the one owner - me - I know for a fact there's nothing wrong with it.  Long story short; I was forced to go to a "referee station."  The closest referee station was in Oxnard - a 90 minute drive!!  (true, there are stations that are slightly closer but those were booked 6 weeks in advance, I couldn't wait that long).  I had to take an entire day off from work, make the long drive out, etc.  The referee station did their checks:  There was absolutely nothing wrong with my car!  They explained to me there was some kind of glitch between Crown Smog's computer and the DMV which caused the VIN number to be off by ONE digit.  That was the ONLY problem.  The referee station fixed the discrepancy in the computer system and that was the end of it.  But this was a huge inconvenience and seriously not cool... all for a car that was in perfect condition and had no issues.</review>< pics>

<text>This place is great! Tony was very professional and asked a series of questions BEFORE he started the test to make sure my car would pass on the first try. Timewise, I was in and out in under 15 minutes with my results and my Certificate sent electronically to DMV.
I got home and was able to pay my registration in about 5 minutes.
Thanks again Tony and Crown Smog!</text>< Rating>

Wouldn't honor the coupon for my 2002 Porsche Boxster S. Told me $40 instead of $19.95 coupon. Double? Really? I went down the street to Joe's, in and out in 7 minutes tops.< /Review>

Tony was great with helping me get my truck smogged ... price is great and service is even better!!! No price gauging on retest ... Definitely will recommend if your looking for an honest place to get your next smog.<//text>

$30 for smog certificate, out the door. Use the coupon on the website.

The shop is not fancy, but beats the heck out of other shops that charge $60 or more.</review>

Ate here for the 1st time today for lunch. Excellent chicken curry with rice and an egg roll.  Also had a bowl of delicious hot and sour soup. Nice inside decor. The staff is very friendly and prompt. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will be back. Everything has an authentic Chinese flavor making this place perfect.

Update: February 2020. This is still my favorite Chinese restaurant in San Diego, but it seems they have changed some of their hours. On Saturdays they do not open till 1 pm,also on Tuesdays they are Closed. Both of these days I was in the mood for some great food, but they were locked up tight and the sign on the door had the new hours I just mentioned.  Anyway, just an update.<//Text>

I order take out from here at least once a month, if not more. For whatever reason, the appetizers like the pot stickers, soup dumplings, and fried chicken are freaking good.

The entrees are less exciting, but not terrible.

My only complaint is that the pickup process is kind of screwy when it's busy. Despite having ordered ahead and seeing my food on the table, I've had to wait for 5 or 10 minutes before the 1 cashier/attendant was free to hand me my food. This is a major turn off for someone that's hungry.< /Text>

Easy ordering online and fast service but the food was disappointing. The salt and pepper chicken tasted like seafood, maybe they use the same oil to fry all the food? And the chicken in the chicken fried rice was not good. The fried rice itself was ok and the veggie lomein was delicious.<//Review>

They were like a frozen spring roll. The gentleman was not friendly too. The place does look clean, but was completely empty at 5pm. I did think it was odd that the counter with the credit card machine and register is facing the wrong way? I think if it’s late and your desperate or intoxicated then go for it. If you like good Cantonese, pass here. I will not be back ✍️🆗< /Review></record></dataset><record>

What a great place. Amazing food at a great price, and super friendly staff. The Sesame Chicken is outstanding, and we also loved the Dan Dan Noodles and the dumplings. My only complaint is that it's in San Diego instead of West L.A., because I swear I'd go there all the time.< /text>

Chopsticks were not available, for some reason the waiter stood a few feet from our table and watched  us eat. Service was good overall but I like the old fashion chinese restaurant look and service style.
Generous portions but lack of utensils.<//Review>

<review>The chicken was NOT chicken. It was absolutely disgusting. My brother and I ate here before a show at the Civic Theater.  We both had fried rice and every piece of chicken didn’t even look like white meat or dark meat. It was jelly-like, fatty in composition. It was inedible.  I can’t even imagine what it was.  I imagine the people who say this place is good, don’t eat the chicken.  Also the fried rice was a small portion, which I didn’t mind, and it was not well seasoned and it was dry.  I’ve been going to Chinese my whole life, NY, LA, Boston, this is no good.<//review>< userid>

Great place, family run. The food is excellent, some dishes will be familiar to Americans, with some classic Chinese dishes we may not be as familiar with.<//Text>

My youth group and I enjoyed People's Bistro catering service. They were delicious and great portion of foods! The dishes were emptied in 10 minutes! And their feedbacks were great than the other catering restaurant we had before. We will definitely invite people's bistro as one of our go to catering/restaurant for Chinese Foods! And they deliver on time and great customer services!!!<//Review>

<text>Pretty good Chinese food, I have been here twice. I have ordered the honey walnut prawns, beef broccoli and the chicken chow mein. All these food items were delicious, I would say the beef broccoli could have had a little bit more flavor. All in all, it was fast service for a Wednesday night. Next time, I will try more items on the menu.</text>< Pics>

The dinner special is no longer offered, and their orange chicken pieces are smaller now. Sadly, I will not be returning. I going to miss this place.

Original review:
I have ordered to go only, and I really like it. I always get the orange chicken which is covered in a sweet syrupy sauce that I transfer over to my rice sometimes. The one veggie roll you get is just ok, but becomes delicious when you cover it in their plum sauce.<//Review>< pictures>

You cannot beat the Lunch Specials at this tiny (blink and you will miss it), NY style, Chinese restaurant!  $6.50 for an entree, Spring roll, soup and a drink!!!

They have the ABSOLUTE best prices and good quality of food.  The cooks will prepare your meal however you request and the service is fast and friendly!</Review>

Taste is good, and authentic. But not so much the service. Did not even serve the water or any drink. Be careful if you ask for extra rice as they will charge extra. Otherwise it's a okay Chinese restaurant.</review>

Elevated dim sum and large format dishes. You can forget everything you think you know about Chinese cuisine. Gorgeous ambiance, perfectly executed service, great tea and libation curation. Everything was just perfect. One drawback is the parking situation (it's on the historic Waverly Street) so I suggest a rideshare or public transit alternative.< /text>

Apparently they can't plan ahead and call the sailors to say when they will be outside the gate, so their manager refuses to deliver to the shipyard because "it takes sailors too long to get to the gate and they have several orders to deliver." I understand you don't want to waste time not have people's food get cold but all you have to do is call before you're actually there and whoever has ordered it can meet you out there. Do you refuse to deliver to gates communities because it takes too long to get through the gate?< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Very mediocre. Hot and sour soup was gelatinous and thick (as if was old). Chicken and Chinese vegetables was hot and seemed to be made-to-order. I ordered a beer and it was room temperature....gross! Probably will not be coming back here. They have decent prices but unfortunately that is about the only “pro”. Service was decent too. I’d rather pay a few more bucks and get better food. Not impressed, would not recommend.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>Its 2019 and we are still doing this…sad

I work downtown, so I know when the lunch rush is, so I always time my lunches for post lunch rush; so when I enter this restaurant it only had 2 people in it. The waiter says sit where ever you want.

After a few minutes he brings me a menu, no greeting or anything. I wait, and wait: remember, it is not busy. After a time, two Chinese speaking ladies come in and sit at the table next to me. They are immediately greeted in Chinese, they are brought chopsticks, and a different menu, a Chinese menu. Keep in mind that at this point my order had not been taken, I have been told nothing about lunch specials, and had not even been given chopsticks, there was a fork on the table.

You see where this is going? The waiter almost took the ladies order first, but then in an afterthought said to them in Chinese, “hold on I need to take his first”. He takes my order and leaves, the ladies and my food comes out at the same time.

My wonton noodle soup was plain, very little flavor. I had just been given the Gweilo treatment (foreign devil in Cantonese). About 3 minutes after I got my food they left my check on the table, and I am thinking you were real quick to break that out! I had to ask for chopsticks by the way.

I obviously worked downtown, it would seem smart to try and build up your downtown customer base instead of alienating someone on their first time at your restaurant. Such a pity because I am big fan of Chinese noodles; it is a pity my neighborhood place is too far away to go for lunch….

Oh well I tried…<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

If you're from the east coast and you miss the Chinese food, order from here. New York style food and New York style driving lol! It took them exactly 20 minutes from the time I called to order until they got to my house. I've never had delivery so fast in my life. Will definitely come back.< /review>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>Gross. We ordered 50$ worth of food. Combination fried rice, chicken fried rice, fried chicken, egg rolls, pan fried noodles and chicken and black bean.
Greasiest food I've ever had it was literally leaking out of every box it came in and stained the table. Even my can of Pepsi had grease on it. The chicken fried rice had under cooked chicken and some of it was brown. The combo rice tastes like it's microwaved and the shrimp tasted like powder, also under cooked. The pan fried noodles were burnt to a crisp and flavorless, also had a nice long black hair in it. The egg rolls were out right nasty. Nothing was authentic in the slightest sense of the word. My mom took one bite of the chicken and bean and spit it out. The ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the place refunded most of our money. I would never recommend to anyone!</Review>< Pics>

Horrible service. We had 7 people in our group....  The waitress was being such an ass that didn't allow us to sit together.....  She didn't want to move 2 tables so that we could sit together.... Even said "well are you going to eat or not".....  I wouldn't suggest this place at all even when reading the reviews.....Be NICER<//review>

<review>Not bad, typical Chinese food fare...We failed to notice any distinction for "New York style fine Chinese Cuisine"...posted food service inspection rating of "A" was reassuring but incorrect. Visited today for lunch...steamed mixed veggies and chicken with white rice. Chicken was undercooked and pink, too risky to eat. Very dissapointed.</review>< Pictures>

Hands down, the best Chinese food in the Gaslamp/Downtown/Harbor area.  This hidden gem is easily overlooked, or completely missed, sandwiched between a bar posing as a restaurant and a clothing store posing as an art gallery. Service is always great, the ONE wait is always polite and never lets let's your glass go empty. If you're looking for a bougie place to eat, not the spot. You come here for the food, period. They also deliver. :-)</review>

<review>I wish I could give less!!! We ordered our food an hour and a half ago, as I type this we are still waiting!  I called at 11am to order and was told 45 minutes.  I called at 12:09pm and spoke with Peter, he told me 10 more minutes for the driver.  I called back at 12:27pm, Peter said that he does not know when the driver is going to deliver our food.  He said he doesn't want to give me another time and the driver not show up....THIS IS RIDICULOUS! How do you not know when the food is going to be here??? This place should not be in business with Customer Service like this!  I asked Peter for the manager and he said his manager is not in, the Manager's name is Po.<//review><userid>116673914010242139842< /userid><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I ordered delivery and was told 45 minutes 1hour and 15 min later I called and was told it was on the way.  When it finally got here, not only was it cold but was inedible with the exception of the dumplings and rice.  The sweet and sour pork was all breading and too sweet and wings were horrible skin wasn't even cooked and gave me indigestion the rest of the day!   Do not order from here unless you have no other options.  HORRIBLE FOOD.</text>

I work downtown and this place delivers.  The delivery guys are always very friendly and deliver on time for the most part, or even earlier than expected, which is a plus.

I usually order the wor wonton soup with noodles.  It is delicious!  The broth is tasty, the veggies are cooked to perfection!!!  6 bucks for a large 24 oz cup!!!  LOVE IT!!</text>

<review>I can't recommend this place. My General Tso Chicken was very bad and I couldn't finish it. It did not look fresh nor taste good. My friend ordered sweet and sour chicken, it was ok. BBQ fried rice was very average.
Restroom is at the end thrue the kitchen.
Service below average.<//review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

<text>I wish I could put 0 stars. I had them deliver teriyaki chicken to my hotel room and first off, all of the teriyaki juice... yes juice, not sauce... was spilled all over the bag. The chicken looked like rabbit feet, and was totally disgusting. The rice tasted like it was a week old and had an awful smell. Just overall disgusting and a complete waste of money.< /text><gmapID>0x80d954a7f555226f:0xe01f890a464d72c5<//gmapID><user_name>Ashley Bolden< /user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

I ordered orange chicken and found a large box staple in it. When attempting to simply return it and get my money back, all I got was laughter and they hung up.

I strongly urge everyone to avoid this dump like the plague.< /text>

The general tao's chicken was disgusting and didn't taste like chicken. The pork fried rice had something in it but I wouldn't call it pork. Ended up throwing 90% of both away. Would avoid this restaurant if you want a good meal.<//Text>

This was by far the worst thing I have eaten claiming to be Chinese food. My food had a FLY IN IT. NOT 1 BUT 2 FLIES. ONE IN THE BAG FOR THE WONTONS AND ONE IN THE TO GO SAUCE! The wontons had literally NOTHING inside them. It was just fried batter. I threw up all I ate before seeing the flies, which wasnt much. Terrible TERRIBLE DISGUSTING</text>

I just ordered General Tso, Potstickers and Fried Shrimp and the entire order was absolutely horrible.  The egg roll filling was old and fishy tasting.  The shrimp were over-battered and sweaty.  The chicken (Tso) lacked flavor, was not fried well, all around bad.  The best thing about the meal was the canned soda.  Save your pennies and go elsewhere.  Very low quality - the worst I've had anywhere.<//Text>

The Szechuan Chicken was acceptable, but the General Tso's Chicken was awful. The meat was horrible, I am not sure it was even chicken. Flavor was terrible. I mean even the fried rice tasted terrible. I will say that the dumplings were good.</review>

The service was terrible. The waitress was rude, she refused to give me any advice. The food is horribly dry and salty. Most importantly,  the waitress put a tip on the check herself and I just have to pay it.< /text>

(Translated by Google) The taste is poor, and the pork is actually made with pork. It also eats a chicken bone and has a worse service attitude.

Got no idea how this place is still open. The nurses and the doctors looks like they don't like doing they job. When the nurses & doctors are not in the mood they have bad attitude. Besides having a attitude in the 1st place.< /text>

<Review>I wish I can give this place NO STARS. Very rude receptionist. She wouldn’t even give me an appointment for my son and when I asked to speak to her office manager she told me no that she’s busy. What kind of professionalism is that ?! I could barely understand the woman with her weird accent. Do not come here. I like Palmdale pediatric they’re good.< /Review><Date>1605896200851<//Date><UserId.>114893452515188699386</UserId.>< pics>

I can't even speak to anyone, I've called so many times and I press all these numbers to get through to make an appointment and its just a recording saying "we're sorry, we can not take your call right now". This is during business hours, morning and afternoon calls. I can't even make an appointment</text>

Took my son to the urgent care. Getting in to do vitals and to a room was very fast. Literally called our number immediately after we got there. Paperwork was pretty quick. We did show up soon after they’d first opened. All the nurses were extremely nice and helpful plus the x-ray tech was awesome. The only thing that was a bit rough was waiting in our room for about an hour just to see the doctor and then maybe another 10 minutes to see the follow up nurse after we went to get a chest x-ray. It was definitely better than being in the main lobby and getting coughed on by other sick kids when that’s what I’d already brought my son in for... turns out he most likely has bronchitis so I also didn’t want him coughing on anyone else anyways but it’s also good that he didn’t get the chance. However he’s four and was bored because it’s doctors office and the TV is just in the main waiting room so there wasn’t much for him to do other than letting him play a bit of “doctor”. We saw Dr Vallejo-Sinavsky and she was patient and made sure to remind me to catch my son up on his most recent vaccinations that I had let slide.<//review>

AVOID!!!!! Horrible bedside manner from both the doctors and nurses. If you do decide to go be prepared to spend your whole day there and only spend 10 minutes with the doctor when he gets to you. This place needs to be checked out or shut down. They don’t help you.< /text>

Excessive wait times with an unprofessional and uncaring staff. One doctor was so rude that a nurse apologized for her behavior. One time, my paperwork got mixed up with another person and they did not give a damn and even laughed about it. I hate this place, but I have no option. I stopped taking my medication because I can't stand this place and it's nearly a traumatic experience every time, I'm not even exaggerating.<//review>

I Was sitting in the waiting room for 5 hours and still did not get seen. Nurses were outside on their phones and in their cars. Triage nurse falsified documents saying we came at a later time than when we arrived. This place is literally the worst. There is a roomful of sick people there any time of the day, and they still take their time to see a significant amount of patients.<//Text>

< review>
If I could give zero stars I would. Don’t come here at all if you are in need of good services. I had a family member come for a chest x-ray, they waited for two hours and weren’t even seen by the doctor. The nurse said she reschuled them and when they went back for their appointment they were made aware that the nurse never reschuled it. I guess they were to busy gossiping about their personal lives during their Christmas party.</review>

<userid>108081282397540770378<//userid><review>First of all let me start by saying I have no problems with the nurses they were helping me out with all the questions I had but when it came down to being checked by doctor Vogler it went to hell. She started to criticize instead of tryin to help she was very very judgmental towards my life when that had nothing to do with my sickness. Also when I wanted to let her know about other symptoms she cut me off and instead told me that we can only focus on one thing like how does that make any sense when I’m coming here to be helped but instead we can only focus on one thing. Why be in the medical field if all your going to do is judge instead of help. HIGHLEY RECOMMEND YOU STAY AWAY FROM DOCTOR VOGLER!!!!!!</review><gmap_id>0x80c256496de55919:0xf705e415c762485b<//gmap_id>< response>

Since being their patient I have had to go to Palmdale regional every two months for the last year to get my anti-depressant as an emergency! (Because if my refill ends on Wednesday his nurses can’t put the request in until he is in office) Dr.khan only works half the week this is my primary care physician he can’t ever be reached and his nurses never relay the messages to him. So every other month I start going into really bad depression because my medication refills are not consistent it’s an unfair revolving door with this clinic. The staff is so rude , I’ve tried to get my refill through the urgent care when he is out of office and the urgent care has told me they stopped giving people they’re sike meds because they don’t actually have that authorization(after sitting there for 5 hours)!!!! I’m sick of this treatment it’s cruel and unjust I’ve made multiple complaints so have many many other patients at this clinic. I feel discriminated by my condition I never ever had this problem when I was a patient at cedars or UCLA , if you have serious issues this clinic treats you like your gum stuck on a shoe bottom line!!! Your better off going to th er than this pigs pin . oh an I’d like to talk about the cleanliness of this Facility it’s disgusting I have pictures of the room they put me in hair on the floor , dirty exam bed the paper was all crinkly and had GLITTER on it , floor looks like it’s never seen a mop . It’s very saddening the type of care you receive and how I’ve seen disabled patients sit there all day because they didn’t grab a number :( I gave my place (number) to an elderly black woman who was def I’m literally tearing up as I write this it’s so horrible please somebody do something about this !!!< /text>< Pics>

The nurses there are on point. You can tell these nurses care about the patients by the way they are none stop. I mean come on people they are human too they need a break here and there yet other patients only see the negative. I disagree. Great job all of you!!!! $<//Review>

It takes the doctor forever to come in which is odd because it's never a lot of people in there. Dr. Aravagiri is by far the worst doctor I ever had. She's nonchalant, lacks compassion, always in a rush and after all that time you waited to see her, does nothing for you!! You'd be wasting your time going to this clinic altogether.< /text>< rating>

If I could, I would give this place a 0 no star. I got there at 1:30 and didn't get called in until 3, no to mention I was in the room waiting to be seen my a Dr for 3 hours. Also check the time punch thing, because it's 2 hours ahead of time. So in reality they can say I went in at 3:30 not 1:30.<//Text>

<review>WORST PLACE EVER! NO ONE WAS BEING PUT IN ROOM, NO ONE FOR OVER 2HRS. THEN FINALLY THEY PUT ME IN A ROOM AFTER THE 2hr WAIT, AND SOME OLD LADY COMES AFTER ANOTHER 30 MINUTES, TELLS ME I CANT BE ON MY PHONE!
WHAT ELSE DOES ONE DO WHEN YOUR SITTING IN A ROOM FOREVER WAITING?????
THAT IS UNREASONBLE TO ME.  TURNS OUT THE INVISABLE NURSES WERE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE COME FOR A URINE SAMPLE,
WHICH THEY NEVER DID.
NURSE COMES IN FINALLY, HANDS ME A CUP, NOW BY NOW I AM FURIOUS, I CANT BE ON MY PHONE AND NO ONE IS DOING THEIR JOB!
I ASK HER, "HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?" SHE SAYS..." URINE WILL BE ANOTHER 30 Min and XRAY AWHILE"
SO I AM THINKING,
NO PHONE, AND A ANOTHER 2-3 HOURS?
NO THANKS....RATHER SUFFER!
THIS IS WHY KAISER ROCKS!</review><userid>106787275092373761603<//userid><pictures>None</pictures><rating>1</rating>< Name>

I came to urgent care , I've been here for 3 1/2 hours and still waiting. When you ask the staff all they say is I don't know. A family of one of the people that sign you in came in and got seen right away, very unprofessional and rude , don't answer questions and everyone is freezing in here. Horrible horrible!!< /review>

<Response>None</Response><review>I wish i could give this place -5 stars . This is the worst Dr's office i have ever been too. You have to wait hours even with an appointment. My appointment was at 9:00 i wasn't seen til 1:00. And this is everytime i go no matter if it's an appointment for me or my children . Then when you finally see the Dr. after hours of waiting they don't want to listen to your concerns or issues its always a rush never a caring feeling you should feel when you go see your primary care physician. One Dr. In particular Dr. Vasuki Aravagiri is the worst Dr. i have ever ran across. She doesn't listen ,always has a attitude with patients and nurses,  and talks to you like you're a none factor as if she's not getting paid for her sevices. If you are a Dr. and don't care about people or life in general WHY are you in the medical field? I will be finding a new primary care physician for my family. Thanks alot for a whole bunch of wasted time and frustration .<//review>< time>

The worst experience I been here over 3 hours and there was only 1 person in the lobby it seems like they keep everyone for a certain amount of time to charge insurance. Hopefully government and insurance companies catch on.< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) The staff is nice but the wait is eternal, once there was only one person and I in the waiting room to attend, and it took two hours to attend to me, when you go to your appointment, go prepared to spend a minimum of 2 to 3 hours.

It was so bad I didn’t even eat it, since when is this okay??  they still charged $10 and they don’t give chips with to go orders anymore, but that doesn't change the price. I used to love meadows and would eat there frequently but I won’t be wasting money here anymore.  Good luck lasting with low quality food and high prices.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Coffee, tea, food. I nice place for lunch. The chips with the sandwich is a great touch and makes it a real lunch. There is really nice artwork on display. Made me feel like I was in the cafe of a high end art museum. The service comes with pretty smiles too!<//review>

<Review>Both my wife and I really love this quaint little sandwich shop. We had breakfast and the service was great the ladies in there were super sweet and kindness and love, in fact the girl was so sweet she let us have our breakfast crossants on the house. The food was fresh and it was delicious. I highly highly recommend this cafe to all and everyone. Loved it!!!!</Review><Time>1502987134259</Time><username>Krystal Waters<//username><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Looks a little strange from the outside, but very cozy place with good coffee and delicious looking food. We didn't tried the food, but it looked very good and the other guests. We drove out here as it has the best stars rating in the area and it was the right decision.<//text>

<text>Good food,  bliss smoothie wasn't the best, but the blueberry muffin was delicious.  Also the meat, egg, cheese sandwiches were good and the mozzarella bistro was very fresh. A good local find! Service was very good too.  I loved the way the woman behind the counter said to a customer politely, "It's $6.25 and I'll help you when you're off your phone," because people talking on their phones in restaurants/cafes are, in general, obnoxious. Especially when trying to order and pay..</text>< pics>

A very nice place with good coffee and great food, it's also quaint and relaxing except when they're playing pop hits that make you want to smash your computer screen and give up what you've been working on because Rhianna is playing and she sounds like a crying goat that cant find its 87th mate and all you want to do is sit down, concentrate and enjoy jazz like Ellington or Coltrane, maybe some blues like B.B., Hopkins, or Muddy, I mean at least have on Kmud, but please no more nasty pop tunes with explicit lyrics, kids eat here and they deserve a chance.< /Review>

<Text>What a relief!! We were worried we wouldnt be able to find anything but greasy fast food on our road trip... This might be three or four min off the road, but WELL WORTH IT. Fresh ingredients, ridiculously good sandwiches, good drinks, yummy chips...

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I've gone to the Carl's Jr. on Chestnut and Shepherd at least since I was in middle school. I'd say its always been a nice place to eat inside because they keep it very clean and has a nice atmosphere. I've always liked the staff there whenever I've gone. It's more expensive than other fast food places around, but their standard burger, "the big cheeseburger" is pretty inexpensive.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>When I come in here, all I see are tired looking staff and overweight, obese men sitting alone, no wife and no family.. makes me sad. The staff could at least try to be a bit friendlier to make it better, and PLEASE— CLEAN THE FLOOR! Last time I was here, there was a dark soda puddle by the trash can, and I almost stepped in it... just disgusting. Very good burgers and onion rings here, a tad overpriced but not too bad really, so it's a shame the atmosphere is so unacceptable. Clean the floor, teach your employees basic manners, and you've got a half decent place. I will be praying for those overweight men as well... there is always a chance to turn your life around.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Worst Carl's junior burgers I have ever had came from here.  I don't know what took them so long but I swear to God, mcdonalds makes better food, and more fresh than this place! Burgers tasted old and dry, fries were half cooked and the chicken strips looked like a few popcorn chicken (like the size of a quarter of a strip of chicken) and was rubbery and hard! Both of us didn't finish it and did I mention it was 35 bucks for this meal! If I known I was guna eat old food I would have went to mcdonalds because at least their food isn't old! I'm so disappointed because they are so expensive and they don't even make it fresh!<//Review>

So I went to get the beyond bbq cheeseburger and come home and find bacon on it! I go back and tell them and the lady says “it isn’t supposed to have bacon?” ITS A PLANT BASED BURGER she even pointed at the pic that had no bacon and when I got back the fixed product it had the small onion rings instead of the big ones you are supposed to have and the old one had the big ones too, didn’t even get a sorry when they gave me the fixed product also never going here again!< /text>

< Review>
The main issue is that I did not receive the correct order. I was short half of what I had placed in the drive thru. With having a car full of angry children I did not do the right thing and check my order after I recieved it.  When I did hand out what I recieved the fries where soggy and the burgers where a mess.< /Review>

<review>The food was pretty good and the drive-thru was a little slow (Mon. Around 11:00AM). There’s one employee that I recognize because she was in one of my college classes last semester.

Way over priced and not that great anymore.  Too many cook to order burger joints in town that charge less.  Their prices are comparable to Red Robin for a SMALL combo.</Review>

<review>At 1-2pm monday I was eating my food. Taking my time since I had an hour lunch. I had one of the workers come up to me and ask if I wanted my stuff thrown away while i was still clearly eating, tbh i didnt really like that.

i Went to go eat here at night through the drive-thu  and asked for some  jalapeños in my sandwhich and when i got home the jalapeños were so old and brown, looked like mold to me and my friend we were so disgusted...  also smelled terrible. i can’t beleive a store that you spend so much money on their food, can do something like this.. come on like we know how our food is supposed to be... fresh as always.. don’t eat here at night!!  actually don’t here at all the employees are dirty especially the ones in the kitchen.. have some respect for your all customers especally the common ones;)!!!</Text>

Not sure if they were having a bad day or if they're just not very organized.  An almost empty restaurant, but their service was slow, and all three of our orders were wrong. They were apologetic and made it right. Hard to imagine how they could handle being busy.< /Review>

Great place to buy your meat and it's cheaper than Walmart. Top notch quality.
Ribeye steaks about $16 each wetaged and perfect. I got a whole slab of Bacon 🥓 for $21.50 and I had quarter inch bacon 🥓 slices with breakfast this morning. I love this place. Thumbs up.< /Text>

I can say without a doubt and I've been in San Diego since 1978 they have the best carne asada I've ever had
Why way back from Phoenix to San Diego I'm going to stop by and pick up 3 chuck roast and I'm going to smoke those puppies for 4 to 6 hours and I guarantee you it's going to be like eating a beef rib without the bone< /Review>

Check-in was COVID-19 safe. Room was non-smoking but still smelled strongly of smoke. Room was also recently updated and was alright (new paint, crown moulding, new headboard, new TV, new nightstands and lamps, new room A/C). Room was on railroad track side, and the first night, the trains were disruptive. The second night I didn't notice them. Location was fine, walking distance to restaurants, beach, and a lagoon for birding.<//Text>

<review>Quick check-in, polite staff, easy to find and see from the main entrance to Pismo Beach. The rooms have the bare essentials, Pantene, bar soap, coffee maker, reg & decaff. The beds we're not soft, more on the firm side and not as comfortable as we were hoping but you really don't care after walking all day on the beach. Great from families, 2 dbl beds, and a great price for the Friday before memorial day weekend $167 after tax</review>< pics>

<review>Bad front staff. Booked mine online at Hotel.com. was asking me to pay $95 on top of what I paid online. I said why. He said he canceled my reservation already. I paid Hotel.com with insurance fee. They still did not acknowledge Hotel.com. bad bad bad. A Guy came up to me may be a stay in guest and said "F" this place he stated. Hotel.com tried to relocated me but it ruined our mini get away already. My baby needed to sleep and needed changed and be fed from 3hrs drive but ended up going back home. Bad hotel management and bad marketing online. I should say be aware of this kind of hotels. Online booking with insurance will still not be acknowledged by the hotel it self. Hotel.com you ruined our mini vacation.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
My husband and I had wait outside our room every time we needed to get inside out room so that they could let us in. They only had one key and wouldn’t let us have it. The owner came out with no shirt and made us feel like an inconvenience to open our room. His children were minors working the front desk and held on to my debit card number on a sticky note if we ruined the towels because of going to the beach. We did not stay there that night, worse hotel experience I’ve even had.</Review>

Outstanding staff very friendly and helpful.  Room were very clean and seemed fleshly paint.  There was enough  towels, items for coffee .    We had 2 rooms rented as we went as care providers for the other room.
Ice machine was full also a Bbq area (didnt use this trip but will next) only item missing were blankets but didnt ask either just turned heater up for a bit.  Comfy beds compared to most area inns. Pillows perfect. Everything spotless.  Looking forward to a return stay. They made you feel like family. Awesome job Jackie n staff  welcome to our coast

Don’t stay here if you want a good nights rest. It was terribly loud up until 1am with lots of stomping and yelling. I’m guessing people stay here after they bonfire at the beach.The room itself smelt like they were trying to febreeze out the hard smell of cigarette smoke. Which is surprising since there’s a $80 deposit (that was no where on the site - cmon hotels.com) and it doesn’t get returned back if you smoke in the room. I would not trust the floor. The bathroom was big to suit a disabled person comfortably, but the floor had very slippery tile and no bath mat. We used a random towel as our bath mat and when we picked it up it was black and brown. Disgusting!We were looking for a nice rest stop before driving the rest of the way to San Diego from the Bay Area, and this was definitely NOT it.< /review>

If you'd like "housekeeping" to go through all of your things and not clean the room, then stay here! Called the desk to talk to them about my stolen property and the very violating experience only to be told that he has to speak to housekeeping before talking to me. Never called back. Don't stay here. I paid $320 for this terrible experience.</review>

Not very good they are not worth the money the tub did not drain they kept my deposit becouse they found a box lighter on night stand try to say I smoked cigarettes in room I pointed out how they seen me outside smoking that is a shifty hotel and you get charged as much as a suite at Sheridan or best western plus that is night an day no comparison as far as accommodations are concerned fact I got a suite at both up scale hotels for cheaper on price line so save your cash< /review>

< Review>
I booked a room here online, we were coming in late and traveling with our dog. I booked a basic room that listed rooms as being pet friendly. We arrived at around 11pm to a man that was clearly asleep (which I get, it was late no problem) he said he has no reservation for us, I showed him the site I booked on he said it was the correct site but didn’t have a room for us, I showed the confirmation he said he wouldn’t let us stay because we had a dog I showed him on his site where it said they were dog friendly but he didn’t care, he clearly wanted to just go back to sleep and not deal with it at all. Which then put us in a predicament because we were extremely tired from driving all day and now had to drive around to look for another place (which we were unable to do because everyone was either not dog friendly or had no availability) we ended up driving another hour practically falling asleep at the wheel and slept in a rest stop in our car. This guy was rude and could care less about the safety of us or the other people on the road.< /Review>

Room was nice, but and this is a very big but, first they charged us the wrong price, were supposed to cancel it but didn't. Then they charged us 4 times for the same room! I'm still working with my credit card company on that. And this is  2 months later.  Good lesson for paying cash I guess.< /Review>

I like that it's close to the dunes. Aside from that the restroom was dirty and moldy. Night staff have attitude and are rude<//review>

Terrible customer service... don’t stay there rip off! Dirty rooms and very noisy...  way to much traffic going to the beach..you’d have to be in your  20s or drunk to get any sleep..I would want my worst enemy to stay there!
Pay more somewhere else and get your moneys worth.   Terrible place!<//Review>

<Text>Its was a troubling weekend, i checked in requested a non smoking room since i had my 79 year old grandmother and my newborn son. The manager try to give me a room that was smoked in stated he had placed fans in. After realizing the room was upstairs i went back and requested a room downstairs but manager said they did not have anymore rooms downstairs. Next morning i asked the new clerk for a room downstairs. I was given a new room w no problem (109). I moved all my stuff downstairs i used the toilet, washed my hand and left. 2 hours later i come back to find my room door open. I asked 1st employee i seen he said my room had flooded and i had to wait for the manager to get a new room and get my stuff. The manager had finally came back (from renting a rug cleaner). The yelling contest began, i asked what had happened he started pointing at me n yelling i put tissue in the toilet. Of course I was not going to let this grown man yell at me so i began to argue with him i did not flood the toilet. He than states it was me since that room hasnt been occupied in a long time, which he had to be lying since the day before i requested a downstairs non smoking room and he stated there were none available. I was given my old room back eventually. It was a headache to say the least. So save your money. Manage is supposedly the owner and he is just rude.</Text>< pics>

The location of the hotel was just minutes away from the beach, where you can drive your own vehicle for 5 dollars. The hotel room was clean and the beds were fair. The only thing that I didn't like we're the flat pillows. Other than that it was a good stay.<//Text>

<text>My husband made reservations for tonight online last night and asked what time the office closed and was told 11pm. We drove 300 miles and got there at 9:30pm. The office was dark, but the sign said to ring the bell once, so we did. The gentleman came out from the back seemingly irritated that we'd interrupted...whatever he was doing and my husband gave him his name for the reservation only for the guy to tell him that they had overbooked and had given our room to someone else without giving us a call or even an email to let us know.  So 300 miles away from home and we had to scramble to find somewhere else to stay the night! Thankfully the the lady at the American Inn took pity on us and gave us a discount for the night.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Courteousness was out standing. Great price. Great location. Staff was very pleasant and down to earth. The hispanic gal withshort hair super sweet. Very rare to have good. Customer service these days. Thank you Oceano Inn. Gina Barrios</Review>

<Name>Collin Rokke</Name><review>Great reasonable price near the beach! Unfortunately I'm drawn away and towards camping due to the smells of cigarettes in the room, the sheets that still have someone else's food (I hope) on them, the guy complaining about the freezing cold when he's having a conversation right outside my window in his shorts at 5am, or maybe the filthily gross in room coffee pot (has anyone ever cleaned these things!? There's all kinds of algae [again, I hope] in the water container so disgusting!!!) which is advertised on their sign...</review><Rating>2</Rating></record>

Clean, reasonable price, easy access to the beach and ATV. GREAT if you want to go ATV and dune buggying. It's the only hotel that is closest to the shops. Overall the hotel was a good place to stay overnight.</text>

We were driving north along Highway 1 all day, and just found this place coincidentally when it was time to rest. The owner was very nice, and gave me a very reasonable price for having no reservations. (It was a weekday in mid-May.) It was within walking distance to a state beach where we witnessed a beautiful sunset. There were a few restaurants also easily within walking distance. Clean rooms with microwave and refrigerator. A good deal. I would stay there again if I ever drive Highway 1 again.<//review>

<Review>When we walked into our room at 1st we were very pleased, room appeared clean and smelt  good. Then when it came time to get ice in the ice bucket thats when we found liquid in it along with remains of food etc. We ended up going to the store and getting a bag of ice. Then the tv went out., they did come up to look at it but there was nothing they could do. Final straw was when I took a shower there were lets just say small hairs all over it..not cool! No apologies or even a mention of a refund discount or anything...we wont be staying here again<//Review><response>None</response>< UserId.>

THUMBS DOWN
The rate on line says $95.00. They charged me $285 in total, says the rate online is incorrect. I asked to speak to the owner and was told, my message would be passed on but don't expect a call , he does not speak to customers. His name is Alex, and no last name. He only comes in sometimes, I was told.  My suggestion, stay some where, that the owner cares.< /Review>

<Review>Room was clean. Location was convienent for its proximity to beach access but we did not feel super safe.  The hotel was split with an alley way.  Management was very rude with any interaction.  He seemed irritated we had a dog even though they claim to be pet-friendly ($20/night fee).  Our dog barked one time while we were unpacking our car to notify us of a suspicious character walking in our direction.  The manager ran outside to tell us to quiet down.  We won't be staying here again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I will never stay here again ,it was not the room that was the problem ,I walked by the office and the owner was screaming at a lady .He was yelling at the top of his lungs at her and another lady.The women were in tears crying ,he kept saying they were f...kin liars and to get the f....k out of  his office .Very threatening ,when they women came outside I asked what happen ,she said she had reserved 2 rooms for her family.But canceled 1 room two weeks ago.He wanted to charge her for both .If I had been in there he would have heard from me.I did go in after when check-in out and gave him a piece of my mind.In all my years I have never seen this happen, the old owners were real nice ,THE NEW OWNER HE HAS BEEN HERE ABOUT A MONTH ,IWont ever stay here again ,I'm glad she was not my family or he would have gotten hurt.<//Review>

first i want this review to be read and not dismissed as an extreme review by an upset customer.

I WOKE UP WITH BED BUGS ALL OVER!!!!

02/13/15 MY WIFE AND I WOKE UP WITH BED BUG BITES ALL OVER OUR BODY AND EVEN SEEN BUGS ON THE BED. I TOOK A PICTURE FOR PROOF TO SHOW MANAGMENT.

WHEN THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF MANAGMENT I WAS TOLD I WOULD NOT GET A REFUND. I HAD TO FIGHT WITH THE GUY AND AFTER HE YELLED AT ME HE ONLY GAVE ME HALF OF MY REFUND.

THE MONEY IS NOT THE ISSUE. BED BUGS ARE "HITCH HIKERS" THAT FOLLOW YOU TO YOU AND INFEST HOME. YOU NEED TO TENT YOUR HOME SPCIFICALLY FOR BED BUGS THAT COST AN AVERAGE OF 7000 PLEASE LOOK IT UP.

THIS IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL ESTABLISHMENT AND I WOULD NOT WISH MY WORST ENEMY TO STAY HERE. I CHALLENGE THE OWNER TO RESPOND TO MY REVIEW TO DISPROVE ANY STATEMENTS I HAVE MADE. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WILL HE CALLED.

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GOOGLE BED BUGS AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

IF YOU FEEL MY REVIEW IS TOO HARSH GOOGLE BED BUGS AND THEN IMAGIN THEM CRAWLING ALL OVER YOUR BODY, YOUR WIFES BODY, YOUR KIDS BODY, BITING YOU THEN FOLLOWING HOME ON YOUR CLOTHES AND LUGGAGE AND MULTPLYING BY THE THOUSANDS ALL OVER YOUR HOUSE.< /review>

Omg!! This is my second time coming here and theyre still slow made us wait for good 30-40min to bring our food out. We didn’t even get our drinks until like what...half way done with our food (cough) they didn’t even serve us water. Like honestly bruh can we at least get water first then our drink. Like what’s the point of ordering drinks when it comes at the end of the meal. So disappointing. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to here</Review>

<Text>Good pho. Portion size has been reduced I noticed. Went for bahn mi sandwiches and was good too. Although it would be good if they had spicier options as their jalapenos is not spicy enough for me. I think their pickled jalapenos in their jar on the tables is hotter than the fresh one serve in the sandwiches. Other than that u would have to put Sriracha sauce for spicyness. Too bad no thai chili options to put in there hott.  Besides that it's good for take out and dine in especially when it's raining seasons. Would go back again.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Ordered chicken with rice plate and a large  #12 rare steak with noodles and came ouT to $28! Now I wouldn’t mind but the #12 was smaller than a small and wife finished it in 5 min,  Now my wife is small and doesn’t eat a lot. What a rip off, I understand it’s a pandemic and might be saving food supply to serve all customers... but cmon. Never going back.< /review>< pictures>

I’ve been to this place a couple of times.

The more I come to this place, the more it gets worse.

Their food is fine, it’s the maintenance. Their restroom is gross and looks like it’s never been cleaned before. They even Forgot to give me my order. The waiter that served us didn’t even care to say sorry when he gave the receipt. I’m not asking for much. They should already know what to do...< /Text>

Great place.  I have had a hard time finding a place that made some of my favorites well.
-Calamari
-Spare ribs
-Salted Lemonade
The Pho is good, but the sides are much better!<//Text>

Avoid at all costs.  This place has jacked up it's prices since covid happened.  We cannot allow them to rip off our community like this.  Stay away.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>The waitress was very informative. She explained what everything was and how to properly eat our chosen plates. The food was yummy and fresh. They even have " miracle noodles" for people on low carb diets. It's the excellent service that will definetly make me go back, even if it is on the other side of town from me. Thank you for the lovely experience.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Place closes at 10 pm. We arrived around 915 pm. Right from the get go you can see the employees were dreading about having more customers. It was an akward situation so we hurried up and ordered. Our food came out in such small portions compared to the many times we have came here. We paid dinner prices for lunch portions. That night my family had never ate dinner so fast. We couldn't wait to leave. As other customers entered, one of the waiters had the meanest look on his face while mumbling in his language. This will be the last time coming here. We have no problem with the food being"meh", but when the service makes you feel unwelcomed, it's time to stop coming.<//review>

They have a wide variety of items on the menu and the food seemed fresh and prepared with care. I had the tofu with tomatoes and thought the tomatoes were a bit overcooked. My table also enjoyed some of the shrimp spring rolls as an appetizer, which were very good. The menus were well worn. Since I don't normally eat this style of food, I am not sure what to compare it to. There was ample parking out front.< /review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>For not a fancy place , but the food was outstanding. True Vietnamese dishes and believe it or not, the staff is friendly. We are from #idaho, I work with a few Vietnamese guys, they cook occasionally   for the rest of us , and I have to say that this place does a better job then the guys that I work with, even if they're cooking is considered "home cooked".
Try the Vietnamese sandwich with pork.

The food was very delicious,   and great portions for a awesome price.  My only complaint would be that my wife's cup had some soap stains, and some kind of small black specks stuck on the inside of the cup.< /Review>

Found this place when we didnt want to cook for memorial day and they were one of the only viet spots still open. We usually like Pho Lotus in Elk Grove and this was a great substitute. We had spring rolls, rice with bbq chicken and virmicelli noodes with chicken and eggrolls and honestly we thought there wasnt much difference!<//Text>

<Review>Thank you! Great experience, great food. Wonderful staff. Staff was quick to notice I was hesitant about the pho I received, they switched it out for the one I ordered. Then I found out I ordered wrong, love pho, but always order it wrong. Again, the staff came to my rescue. Not only did they tell me what I want to order, they got me the pho I wanted. I feel bad that I went through so many bowls of pho, but so grateful for the staff. Having a sore throat, I wanted pho and they delivered. Thank you!< /Review>< pics>

So tired of asking for extra rare steak on the side and they bring my pho with the supposed extra already in the bowl. Literally pulled the rare steak out and counted it this time, the so called extra was 5 pieces! I won't be back, so many other places to get pho that won't rip me off!</Review>

Never had tasteless food.  Nonmatter how much fish sauce abd chili pepper I added, nothing helped.  I also ordered a 3 color drink, and it only had one color.  They argued with me that the red was there.  I could've dug my waybto China and it wouldn't have been there.  Then she said it was at the vottom but she added more.  Yeah, right!  I was born on a Tuesday, but not last Tuesday!!  Smdh!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809ac5d92b00f789:0x4278cabca77eedf7<//GmapID></record>

Recently, waitress have change and the two male waitress seem to always forgot order. It pretty bad when you leave because they only serve half your order. I wouldn't recommend it anymore. Used to like this place. Probably will not go anymore.<//Review>

This is my first time seeing him and I would highly recommend him.    I’d like Ventura orthopedics in general. I also had my knee replacement surgery there with Dr Turk and I’ve had nothing but very good experiences. The staff is also great<//Review>< user_id>

By far the worst experience I’ve experience with a medical facility! Completely unprofessional. Unprepared. Been rescheduled & rerouted to different facilities in different cities. Throughout my month long scheduling & rescheduling. I never was seen by one therapist. Not once was I treated. I was only offered apologies. The common theme here is “our system is down”.
If you are in pain as I was & you need care. I advise you find it somewhere else.
Completely blown away by their lack of care for me.< /Text>

The practice is very well-organized and they strive to keep wait times to a minimum. The front desk, scheduling and medical assistants are very nice and very efficient.
Although going to doctors may not be a favorite thing to do, Ventura Orthopedics makes the process as easy and pleasant as it could possibly be.

We highly recommend Ventura Orthopedics. Dr Kim Caputo has wonderful bedside manner with her patients. I love how she talks with my son, explains everything in a thorough and caring way, and everyone we interacted with was helpful, friendly, and accommodating this entire past year. Sometimes you have to wait a bit, but it is worth it for the care you get.< /Text>

<review>I took my son here after fracturing his elbow as this is where the ER recommended taking him. When I called to make an appointment the gal on the phone, Carla, made it sound like I was a total inconvenience to her. NOTHING friendly about the initial call. When I took my son in for his appointment I was not surprised to have that same attitude at the front desk upon check in! Yay! The wait wasn’t horrible, and we made it back to an exam room. The doctors assistant was slightly nicer than the people at the front. The doctor, Rearick, was amazing!!!  Dr. needs to get out of there and find an office where the staff reflects his personality. He clearly doesn’t fit that environment. Because I like this doctor we will stay to finish treatment. However, none of my family will be back to this office.< /review>< UserId.>

The entire staff is friendly and the two therapists I’ve seen, Rebecca and Jared,  are both very good.  They listen to your concerns and provide a plan of exercises and therapy to get you as close to 100% back to normal.  Would highly recommend Ventura Orthopedics.<//review>

Several members of our family have needed Dr Hartman’s expertises through the years. From the person that answers the phone to the doctor everyone that works there is kind, compassionate, and helpful. The doctor explains what needs to be done and will answer any questions you have. They don’t just rush you through the process. Dr Hartman and his staff are outstanding.<//Text>

<text>Dr. Caputo is an excellent doctor who takes time to understand the problem, thoroughly evaluate the symptoms and exam, and explain her recommendations thoroughly and completely.  She also made it a point to speak directly to my son, the patient, as well as myself.  Did we have to wait to see her?  Yes, a bit, but I am learning to understand that this is a sign of an excellent, thorough doctor who takes her time with each patient.  Excellent experience.

This practice has no respect for patients time.  I made an appointment with Dr. Fealey as I have pain in both wrists.  I was told that the Dr. would only look at one wrist at the first appointment.  I would need a second appointment for the other wrist???.  I showed up at the time of my appointment.  After sitting for 45 minutes, I went to receptionist to ask if Dr. Fealy  had been detained by surgery.  The receptionist asked me my name.  It became apparent the they had forgotten me altogether.  I was given a form to fill out, which should have been given to me at the time of my check-in.  I filled out the form.  I sat for another 30 minutes before I was called in to see the doctor. The first thing the nurse asked was how long this problem with my wrist had been going on.  That is a question on the form that I had filled out.  I asked if she had read the form.  She stated she had not.  I asked why I had filled out the form if she was not reading it prior to seeing me.  Upon seeing the doctor, I asked is he was aware of the delays that I had experience.  He did not want to discuss the issue.  He walked out of the room and stated that I would have to speak with the office manager before he would proceed with the appointment.  That took another twenty minutes.  Finally  I saw the doctor.  He asked about my problem and recommended treatment.  We made an appointment for a week later to look at the other wrist.  Upon arriving for second appointment, I sat for 30 minutes waiting to be seen.  I asked for my records and xrays and left without seeing doctor.  This office obviously believes that their time is more important than the patients.</Text>

Dr. Turk has treated me for two different orthopedic problems.  His care was of the highest calibre, and saw me through a very scary time.  The office support staff all act as professionals that care for the best outcome.  Thanks to all.< /text>

VC Orthopedics was an extremely professional organization to deal with. I don't have insurance. It was a breath of fresh air for the receptionist to list off the prices transparently and confidently. I was able to make an appointment the same day I called. Dr. Rearick was knowledgeable and answered all my questions about my broken foot. He was sympathetic, but firm on what I must do to heal quickly. All in all, a very good experience.<//Text>

<text>All I can say is that, ever since I became a patien of Dr. Kamyar Assil back on 1996, at the Broadman Medical Center in Culver City.
My life has gone on a complete 180 degrees transformation, and it was all for the best on my behalf because, he was the first one out of all the many other doctors that had treated me, and specifically the one that were picked by the insurance company but.
Doctor Assil is the one that help me to get off the wheel chair, he sure is a doctor you can trust any day of the week. I was even able to go back to my old job " truck driving".< /text><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

<text>I am so impressed with the caring efficiency of the entire staff. I called on a  Friday morning needing an appointment ASAP due to a painful foot injury. The kind lady who answered the phone offered me an appointment that very morning at 9:45 AM. After arriving, a kind young man, Josh, escorted me to X-ray. The X-ray tech was also very kind and friendly. After reading my X-ray, Dr. Rearick took the time to clearly explain my injury to me and course of treatment he was suggesting. Thank you, Dr. Rearick and staff, I appreciate both your professionalism and kindness. 😊😊😊<//text>< response>

I have been with Dr Assil for over 7 years. He recently started treating my headaches that I have suffered with for years. It was not uncommon for me to suffer from headaches that would last two or more weeks. And they could become debilitating. He treated me with a procedure called "spenopalatine ganglion blocks"for my frontal headaches.  What a difference!  No more headaches!  Different environmental pressures always brought on headaches for me. But since I started with the blocks, no more headaches. So thank you Dr Assil for your help!  I have been receiving this treatment for over two years successfully.  I got a great deal if my life back.<//review>

Went in for an ACL tear, booked me with a doctor that doesn’t even do ACL repairs, but didn’t tell me this. It wasn’t until the end of my doctor’s visit that the doctor explained this to me, but still billed me because he’s a “knee specialist” and his “advice” was considered service rendered. Hip-Hip-Hooray for you V.O.</Text>

I always go to Ulta. I have always had a great experience on Ulta. Ulta is my favorite beauty store to buy. They have many different types of brands. The store is always so organized and they have the best quality on products. My mother is also a great fan of this store. She is the one that recommended this store to me for my beauty products. I trust my mother because she has great taste in makeup and she is always testing new products for hair and skin. The last time I went I had problems with choosing a great foundation that matches with my skin. I had to ask a worker which one I should pick. The worker seemed to have knowledge with makeup and she did pick me a foundation. Getting to my house I tried it and I was perfect. The foundation perfectly matches with my skin. Definitely the store has good attention with customers.</Review>

Yes, yes, yes, !!!! I love it! Allie and Joseph helped me pick out some products and everything that they suggested for me was so on point! From the color to the product. They were very knowledgeable and informative.  I highly recommend them to be "Employee's Of The Month". Thank you again Allie and Joseph!</Text>

<Review>Went in yesterday morning for nail files and walked out with a skin treatment set by Mario Badescu, and some hair products by Philosophy. The staff that helped me out was cosmetic specialist but was very polite and very helpful considering it was not her area. Provided me with great options for what I was looking for. Didn't get her name but she made it easy.</Review>< pics>

I normally don’t come to this location but since it’s close to my job I decided to come here I was helped by the young lady named Cynthia she was so much help and so knowledgeable with her products she was able to help me with every single question I had and gave me some really good recommendations. And to top it off extremely friendly thank you so much Cynthia< /review>

I was looking for a specific product and everyone appeared busy until I found an employee and when I tried to talk to her she completely ignored me when talking to her male coworker. I found it completely disrespectful because I asked for her attention, kindly, various times. I got tired of waiting because she looked at me and kept talking with her coworker. I walked away to put back my products because I did not want to shop here anymore. When she realized she went to follow me and now tried to help. She was blonde and tall. Extremely rude and will never be returning.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>If I can give this place a negative star I would. They greet you yes. I can't even walk around to look at things without them looking at you the whole entire time. Walking around you like you are some sort of thief. Little do they pay attention to the ones who do actually sneak products in their puerses.I don't just like walking in stores for fun. Even before pandemic they have always been like that. I understand one thing like keeping a eye. Another thing making people feel uncomfortable.<//review>< user>

<review>WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!
I was at this place yesterday with my husband and we took 2 colognes and 1 hand cream to the front cashier. When we got home and checked the receipt we found out they charged us for 3 colognes!! So I came back today and the security guy would not let me go thru to get to cashier and ask them to give me money back for the extra cologne they charged me for. He made me stand in line like everyone else!! This mistake of an extra charge was theirs and they want me to waste more time waiting outside in line? Next time you go to Ulta check your receipt so they dont charge you for extra items you are not taking home... but  they might be keeping for themselves!!</review>< gmapID>

Employees don’t care about their job, the customer service is pretty bad too. I always check the makeup I buy from here because people open the products and try it on sometimes. Better safe than sorry.</Text>

Actually I’m being very generous giving you a one star, because the service was horrible I was looking for a branded ordinary product that was sold out and i might as well ask for my gift, the girl in the cashier said I’m sorry we don’t have it, I was with my friend who works for ulta in Downey and they offer a different gift when they are sold out of a certain one, but the girl never offered anything, I always go to that ulta because I love it but she was so unprofessional she could’ve offered me something else I always spend money this time I didn’t bc they didn’t have the item I was looking for if that’s the case I would’ve gave my business to the store my friend works at! Thank you for nothing won’t be coming here anymore! Disappointed</text>

Cashier was so nice to take her time and explain why some deals online aren't available in store to me (I'm new at this) and sent me home with good advice. Staff is so friendly. Makeup at many different affordable prices. Everything you need here. If this place ever closes imma cry.< /Text>

I booked appointment for 2:30 yesterday. I arrived at 2:15. I approached the counter, the person, was with a client, he did smile at me ,but never actually acknowledge me. I sat near the cash register waiting. Employees, walked by. There was an employee near me ,she just kept on working never acknowledging me. By this time it was 3pm, when that employee working near asked me if I was being helped, I told her I was waiting for Justice, then she walked away. Justice was done with his client, came up to register, I was a foot away from him and not once did he look at me or bother to acknowledge me. He kept on taking to his client.  I told him I had an appointment at 2:30 he responded I'll be right with you. Then his client decided that her hair felt heavy and asked him to thin it out. So they went back to his station. Another 15 minutes past. It was 3:45 when he finally sat me me down, he asked what I wanted done. I showed him a picture of a , a line layers Bob. He asked ok it's longer in the front I did yes. So he  cut my hair dry from the back and showed me the length I said yes that's fine. After that he washed my hair and proceed to cut my hair. He dried it a bit. I asked for a rubber band. He gave me one, I put on my hair. I paid and went home. I showered and styled my hair. The right side is longer than the left! My hair is one length, no layers . I got a chin length, buster brown, lopsided hair cut minus the bangs, for 40 bucks! I am a cosmologists did hair for many years, and the first thing I did was acknowledge the clients even if I was busy,. That's how you keep clients. Never going back!!😬😬<//Review>

This is my favorite Ulta Beauty, it's really clean and had stock of things that I wanted. Overall well run!

I've been to a lot of Ulta's all over the US and this is by far the best. So many in LA are not the cleanest and always out of stock.</Text>

I love the option of having high end and drugstore quality makeup available in one store. If you have the money then go for it and spoil yourself and if you're more on a budget then you have the drugstore option, nevertheless there's always something for everyone at Ulta. The staff is friendly and helpful and I love the rewards points program it really comes in handy when you save your points. I am a platinum rewards member and I love the perks. Ulta is the best.</text>

Nice clean store but it takes way more than it should for check out. I am buying one item. I don't want to wait 30 minutes. If you keep this business practice up you will have all of your customers shop online at home to avoid the wait time. Problem with that is your company loses the edge it has with availability/ convenience online. There are lower priced, lower shipping time retailers online.</Review>

Love coming here for the salon and love their point system. I always find coupons and deals for what I'm looking here. Hairstylist Diana is such a sweetheart. I always go to her and bring my mom do get her hair dyed by her. She makes you feel so comfy and beautiful.<//Review>

Very bad customer service not one employee asked if we needed help. We headed to the salon as we wanted to dye our hair, there was two employees there each with a customer they saw us approaching but didn’t offer help either, each of them kept attending their current customer. There was no chance to ask questions both women didn’t look up at us after that first time they saw us heading their way. The cashiers weren’t friendly at all either the girl looked & sounded annoyed when my aunt asked for the price on an item, as there wasn’t one on the item itself nor the isle we found it in ( It was in the correct spot there was plenty). To top it off the security kept doing circles around the areas we were in. Very uncomfortable place to be in, we won’t be back.< /text>

<text>I needed to exchange a concealer and had a lot of questions. I know they had just open so I was patient because I know they were busy. Cara was the girl that helped me. She was so understanding to all the questions that I was asking. Even the silly ones. I needed someone to guide me and tell me the steps on what to do to my face. She made me understand what I was doing wrong. And that everybody's skin is different. She really helped me understand and what to do...... Ladies ......Cara is the best!!!!!😊😍😘< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>It was my first time in an ULTA store. At first it was good. I had help when I was on the section where the make-up brands were more expensive. I was helped and given make-up but when I seen the "drug store" make-up I asked for help and was told I'd be helped and nothing. Then I asked a guy for help after he was done with his customer and I was no helped. So I left all the make-up except a KKW mascara.<//Review>< pics>

I wish I could give this store a no star. No one ever asks, if you need help or if you are looking for something in particular. I went on Tuesday afternoon and all the employees were talking among each other. As if it was a high school reunion. Gossip about other employees etc. On top of that this store is very  unorganized. I wanted to buy the Charles  eyeshadow pallet but since no one ask me if I needed help...I assume they didn’t have it when they did. I was very disappointed.  Stop yourself from shopping at this location!!!</review>

I love Ulta but this one is the worst.   Had to hunt down an associate and as soon as she answered my question she just walked away without offering additional help.   We left and did our purchasing at the Downey Landing Ulta.</Text>

Large clean store with a variety of products, which is nice as it's the only Ulta around the area. Not the friendliest staff though...

Update: I've been back a few more times and the problem with the staff is still prevalent. I thought that maybe it was just the younger employees but it seems that the older staff are even more rude. I don't know, I just don't feel like shopping there if the employees are ignoring me or giggling at my accent? I rather just go to the mall.< /Review>

<username>Katherine Batres< /username><text>This salon is one of the best experiences I have ever had in my whole life! First off they are honest. They will guide you into the right path for your hair and make recommendations on what suits you. I came in because my hair was absolutely damaged. It had a lot of old color and brass. The girls here were so patient and kind. They took my frizzy, thick, damaged hair and made it into this beautiful color. They also showed me how to style it and how to avoid further damage. These girls really know what they are doing. They are professional and really care about your hair.< /text><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Stopped in with my cousin and mom because my cousin was looking for a specific perfume that she wanted but one sales girl advised that they were out of stock on the "Versace Bright Crystal Absolu", and that she could either check back or could check the Downey location.  We ALMOST LEFT THE STORE 》》》》》》
Then ZOE came up to us and offered to check the Back for stock that might not have gotten put entirely out onto the sales floor..
ZOE "Thank You"! For Going the EXTRA MILE and EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE even when the store was about to close!
DEFINITELY COMING BACK TO SEE YOU AGAIN  ~ THANK YOU AGAIN ZOE ☆😊💎< /text>

Horrible customer service, I was the only one in line and everybody at the register was just talking away. Jasmine who was the person who rung up my items really needs to work on her customer service skills. The manager really needs to have a talk with her employees about what excellent customer service should look like!< /Review>

The store itself is good, and have friendly staff, but the salon isn't. I went on Thursday to get a formal styling for prom, I paid 60 dollars and honestly it was such a bad experience. I didn't say anything because I tried my best to be positive and enjoy my day but the girl doing my hair (Stacy) started at 12:30 and didn't
Finish until 4:45my prom started at 5:30 keep in mind I still needed to get home and finish doing my makeup and getting ready, she would constantly complain and say she  couldn't do my hair because it was too long and too thick. Maria finished off my hair and was more pleasant.. but I didn't even get prom pictures because of how late it was and by the time
I got to the venue my curls were nonexistent.<//Review>

Found what I was looking for 1 star because the girls there seem to have ulgy attitudes and none of them even smiled. I work in retail and you need to make guest feel welcomed and have a positive attitude toward them and smile the whole time you're there. I felt unwelcomed and some areas were messy not good presentation of the store with the items and employees please fix that.It also seemed like they didn't want to help anyone so they just pretend to look busy and I know what that looks like and they don't even walk up to you.Guest experience should always be number one in every retail store.<//Text>

Unlike other Ulta stores that I have visited, this is the only one where the workers don’t bother asking if you need anything. They act and sound as though they are angry and are not aware of the signs they put on their makeup such as the “buy one get one free” only to find out after waiting in line for forever that the special expired only because they did not notice they had to remove the sign. Very annoying to come to this Ulta. Employees need to practice their customer service skills.</Text>

All the girls and guy that helped me out were super awesome and helpful. They are also extremely patient. Take in mind that I had my 18 month old with me wanting to also try on makeup as she too is a makeup aficionado. Nevertheless, I came out happy with a bag full of new big girl toys (makeup). Also, NYX was having this event to promote their foundation. I had never bought any NYX stuff, that just changed. Keep up the good work, Ulta Team!
Best,

Found what I was looking for 1 star because the girls there seem to have ulgy attitudes and none of them even smiled. I work in retail and you need to make guest feel welcomed and have a positive attitude toward them and smile the whole time you're there. I felt unwelcomed and some areas were messy not good presentation of the store with the items and employees please fix that.It also seemed like they didn't want to help anyone so they just pretend to look busy and I know what that looks like and they don't even walk up to you.Guest experience should always be number one in every retail store.< /Text>

I needed some assistance on makeup but no one was available to help. I ask the security and he had no idea where anybody was either. Only one cashier was handling a long line, poor thing, and i did not want to bug her, she had her hands full. Maybe i will go another day, but i really doubt it.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>If I can rate this store a 0 I would. The staff is so not customer friendly and one cashier really??? while the rest are just there standing around seeing customers pile up in line. As a professional I am disappointed I only love going to Ulta in The San Fernando Valley Like Burbank or Fallbrook where real makeup artist are hired not some regular teenagers that think they better than the customers!!!!

I love this store but.... as a person who works in retail they need to step it up in advertising inside the store. Sometimes items are on sale and you will never find out until you get to the register. For example most of the Ardell products where on sale for 50%off. Was it advertise in its section? No! I found out until i was paying. If i would of known i would of bought more. This has happen at least 4 times already with other items.< /text>

If I could give a zero, I would. while on vacation, On 12/30/17 the m.o.d (manager of the day)who looked more like a janitor with all those keys dangling started following my besties husband for no reason. He came to us and was telling us about how she rudely approached him when she literally started yelling loudly if we needed any help. I was ready to purchase $300 in products We were there to spend money. Ulta really needs to retrain this m.o.d cuz she stereotyped a loyal customer and the ghetto came out of her.

My shopping experience was bad because most of the makeup was disorganized and very filthy. I was checking out the tarte tape counselors and the test samples seemed so dirty and had many layers of makeup dripping. Dont try those on your face. They need to make an effort to keep the store organizer stock and clean up the test samples.< /Text>

Not really busy good store, didn't give 5 starts because sometimes can find the products I look for or there is not that many employees that can help you with your questions.</text>

Management in this location is horrible! Most sales associates are nice and welcoming...I always come in and take home more than 200$ in product. Most of the time I leave happy and call it a day. But I will no longer come to this location ever again.

Kara, a so called manager is the rudest person I have ever come a crossed. I can’t believe her lack of respect. Coming from retail management position myself I’m in awe how she is even a manager. Not professional, can not keep her composure under pressure. Confrontational and very aggressive.

Two times already she has rudely treated me infront of other customers and her fellow employees. First time she tried to embarrass me and the second time she told me I wasn’t allowed to step Into her store...big mistake! I have now called corporate on the same rude employee. Kara, hasn’t grown as a employee still continues to be rude, unprofessional, unqualified for her position in this company. She is not a good example to her team and the rest of management does not fall too back behind her.

If anybody reads this please, don’t come here drive a little further down to Downey. In the new plaza on Lakewood Blvd. You will have a better experience. The store is much cleaner, better staff, more product, and most importantly profesional management that keeps their staff and store looking great. Plus you will not have to ever deal with someone like their unqualified manager Kara. I don’t wish that on nobody. This also goes to the General manager who never reached out to me after all of this. I’m waiting for the districts manager to call me and I’m sure they will then take care of the matter.</Text>

<review>I don have complain with the atore or products,  it's more  about the salon services , omg!! So bad experience it was my first time and the last ,  i think i can do my hair by my self better than pay $ 200, and get horrible results ,  i got orange hair color , on  the highlights , i speend alot money and time , 6 to 9 pm. For nothing i thought if i pay more money its cuz it worth, but it was a disaster,  my hair look like diferent color orange , blond and its not soft , like usually be when i do my hair in a salon,  so never again ,  so disappointed< /review>< pics>

This ULTA has the worst customer service ever I seen in any store what a disappointment, I came in early Saturday morning was looking for a mascara and the girls there seem to be mad or something like they didn't want to be there,  I was afraid to ask any questions, As I was heading to the salon hoping to get a haircut and as soon as the women in the front desk of the salon saw me coming towards them approaching they both look at each other rolling there eyes that's so unprofessional they both wispered something to each other so I instead pretended  to look around looking at the (sale items )they had near the salon hoping one of them would walk away so I could come in for services instead I heard them GOSSIPING to each other about there private life (go clean your stations or dissenfect combs or clean shampoo bowls  ) I'm not one to be nosey but you couldn't help it over hear them chit chatting since they were just standing around doing nothing but talking , when I turn hoping they would stop talking they looked at me again like saying what do you want wow just horrible!!! I left I wouldn't want  negative people cutting my hair< /text>

It was my first time coming to this store usually I go to the one in redondo beach well today didn’t go so well I waste about two hundred on makeup and when I go to the front this lady finish ringing me up and tells me ohh well to bad we don’t have free gift right now .... how are you not gonna have  any usually you call someone and tell them to go the back and see if they have any I have a friend who works at ulta and they usually do have something to give for wasting that much that cashier was rude ....<//review>

Right away I was referred to another associate who asked me my preferrence and right away tried foundation on me. It was exactly what I asked for! She even gave me tips! I got all my questions answered and felt like she was about to do my make up as well lol I was very pleased couldn't get her name. I would definitely recommend!! Idk why the bad comments, maybe the "blonde girl" they talk about isnt there anymore lol< /review>< Date>

< Review>
YOU GUYS NEED NEW EMPLOYEES!!
What did I like about it? Nothing. Besides the products.
Customer service? Disgusting. You walk in there & they don't welcome you, they mad dog you when you're checking out the make up. I'm always buying make up there, so why they acting brand new for ? And when you ask a question or something they be acting like they working for free all mad n s***. Honey you getting paid to assist me, now fix your salty ass attitude & do as I ask.</Review>

the worst costumer service ,the times I’ve been here everyone looks mad and it gives you a weird vibe, you guys are better off going to the one in Downey at least there the employees smile and ask you if you need help and seem interested...</Text>

This store is the worst store that I been to.
The staff there won't help you .! And if you ask a question they will respond back to NO . When items are in sale they don't put the add ons. And they are always out of stock Always . !
I won't return back to store anymore. Really disappointed.</text>

I went to pay and the two Ms who were in conrtigua asked prices and none of the three cashiers helped, they were neglected and the one who dispatched did not speak mada Spanish, very bad attention. From the box area and it is the most important side because they have to give prices, explain colors in short, bad situation.

<Text>(Translated by Google) I give it 3 stars no more because the lady who helped me in the store was very kind, she helped me with what I was looking for, she was interested in helping me how bad it was when the cashier paid, she asked me if I had a number associated with them and I said no and then she told the other client, give me your phone number for the points, I think out of respect and because it was my money, the cashier had to first tell me it's okay if I give the points to her or tell me do you want to register with us since she was a new customer.

Le doy 3 estrella no mas por que la senorita  que me ayudo en la tienda fue muy amable me ayudo con lo que andava buscando se le veia interes en ayudarme lo malo fue cuando pague la cajera me pregunto si tenia numero a sociado con ellos y le dije que no y entonces le dijo a la otra clienta dame tu numero de telefono para los puntos, creo que por respeto y por que era mi dinero la cajera  tenia primero que decirme esta bien si le doy los puntos a ella o decirme quieres regristarte con nosotros  ya que era nueva clienta.< /Text>< Rate>

<review>(Translated by Google) One of the girls who is attending today who also speaks Spanish, with black hair and a little chubby, takes super bad care. Apparently she does not like a job where she must be willing to the public to advise on brand or quality. The person who attended me spoke only English and I asked him if he could help me and he did so very reluctantly. When she finished with me another person came asking her where for a perfume and she just played deaf and went to another part of the place. Where is the quality of service on these sites?

(Original)
Una de las chicas q está atendiendo hoy que habla también español, de cabello negro y algo gordita atiende súper mal. Aparentemente no le gusta un trabajo donde debe estar dispuesta al público para aconsejar en marca o en calidad.  La persona q me atendió hablaba sólo inglés y le pregunto q si me podía ayudar y lo hizo de muy mala gana.  Al terminar conmigo llego  otra persona preguntándole donde por un perfume y ella solo se hizo la sorda y siguió para otra parte del lugar. Donde está la calidad en la atención de estos sitios?</review>< Name>
