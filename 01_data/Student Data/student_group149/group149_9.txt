< Review>
I went in the AT&T store yesterday to upgrade both mine and my husband's phones.  Dawn (I think that's her name) has great customer service skills and she IS VERY knowledgeable! I didn't feel like we were getting gouged on prices or being sold the most expensive products. She knew what she was doing and is very polite and professional.  The guy who was working with her at the time helped me put the shield cover for my phone and he did an awesome job! The two of them have great teamwork. This is definitely my most enjoyable experience in-store at AT&T!< /Review>

The staff is great there! Julie was amazing, she helped switch me and my family over from sprint. It was quick, simple and a easy process. Usually I dread going into phone stores but she changed my experience. It was the best customer service I've been given by far! She was very friendly and helpful. She answered every question we had and made sure we got the best bang for our buck! Will certainly recommend her and this store to my friends! And I will surely return to work with her in the future. Wish i could give her 10 stars!!!!< /text>

A call out to Justin H.  He was polite and patient with my 89 year old mother.  He went above and beyond and through phone calls exceeded expectations in customer service.  He could have easily sent her away to seek the help she needed from the corporate store in Santee.  Instead he went the extra step to be her advocate and make things right for her.  She lost her husband of 69 years a few month ago (my dad).  He was sympathetic and kind.  Thank you for making a difference.   We appreciate you Justin H.<//text>

Usually yelp vs google but could only find the "other" att store at Grossmont. Came by to fix issue with billing. Another store put me as a VA employee rather than the veteran/military plan.  Justin was working by himself and helping me and another customers. He was super friendly and very efficient going back and forth to help us out in a timely manner since the "other" store had opened late and then put a sign saying will return shortly for over an hour.</review>

My 83 year old father stopped in to ask some some questions on how to use his phone. The guy that was working there told him he just needs to figure it out on his own. Guess he thought he was too important to help and acted like he was wasting his time. VERY RUDE!!! I will never go into this location. TERRIBLE way to treat senior citizens!!!</text>

I was amazed at the customer service at this ATT store. Justin greeted me warmly and was immediately able to address the reason why I came in (to get a new phone and review my data plan). He explained the different iPhones and what was best for what, and also recommended a great case and protective cover for it. Justin went so far as to work out the prices for a variety of scenarios (2-year payoff versus 3-year payoff with different data plans) so that I was getting the best deal. He reviewed how to set up my phone at home and even offered to help me install the screen cover if need be. Justin went above and beyond in my interaction as a customer, and I highly recommend this ATT location!</Text>

<text>No matter what any of the other companies tell you, AT& T owns all of the lines.  Also unlike Verizon, they don't usually lie to you. As a matter of fact, I'm going theretomorrow because I have a physical problem with my tablet which I know they can fix on the spot without trying to sell me something I don't need or want.< /text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT TRUST AT&T with your Data and Text. Google up N.S.A and ATT and you will see how they have violated your rights and do not disclose any of this information. They are NOT for Net Neutrality and  they will gauge you for any money. This place is a FRANCHISE and will take you for everything that you got. Be smart and shop around. Best time to get a deal? At the end of the month if you want to sign a contract with this evil company.<//text>

<text>Wife and I upgraded phones and at that time was told if any issues with the phones you can exchange them for the same model phone within 14 days. My phone had an issue from the start - glitchy. Went back to store to exchange and (manager) stated we don't exchange phones.  Then why was that part of your sales pitch? Seriously get your facts right!!!!!!  : /< /text><Date>1449945299470<//Date>< rating>

ZERO stars.  We upgraded our phones, were sold 2 IPADS and told we could cancel after a month.  Just called to cancel and we were told we are under contract for 2 years.  We will be filing a formal complaint TODAY!!!!!!!!   Do not use this store compulsive liars.  You can bet we will be in there after work and every day until they cancel our contracts.  DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE.< /text>

AWFUL!!!
I was satisfied with my plan - like a used car salesman they sold me things that I did not want. When my next bill came in I realized what had happened.

We have been on the phone with AT&T for over an hour to undue the damage done.<//text>

<text>Walked into the AT&T store tonight at Grossmont mall at 7:40 pm and spoke to the representative “Niko”  he was emptying the trash and said “fuc* I just closed out my drawer” I asked if they were open until 8 and he replied with “what did you want?” I gave him the info and he asked which phone I wanted “black or white?” Then “fuc* I don’t have black” I said white then...  then he went to text on his phone and came back to say he couldn’t help me. WOW...  by far the worst customer service ever. This is the AT&T directly across from Daniel’s Jewlers.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I went to this store for the first time on 2/21/15 to upgrade one of my accts and the one that helped me was a Roxanne Monzon, one of the managers there. I did the NEXT program and I asked her how much would I be paying, she said $60 and changed her mind and said it's $90 for the phone tax. She took care of me, they didn't have the phone that I wanted, two different phones. I had to go to the other ATT store but she said we can finish everything else there and just pick up my phone somewhere else. While she was ringing me up, she told me that she will give me a $25 CREDIT towards a phone case and so I picked one out that I liked after looking around. I didn't bother to look at my receipt, and when I got home I noticed that she had charged me for the phone case, that's why the bill was $90. I called and left a message for a call back, no call back. She is a LIAR and a THIEF. I wouldn't dare go back there, I figured $25 is nothing compare to having to see that woman again. WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE. If you are reading this, go somewhere else! This store and that manager was reported to AT&T!<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Nico was horrible. Rude. Argued with us. Told another customer he didn't want to deal with us. I can't believe he has his job still.
He lied and being able to do something at the beginning then refused to do so later. Will never come back.< /Review>

Both at&t stores closed 20 mine early on a Saturday night. I am so upset about this cause I rushed over there and the men both looked at me like draw is closed! One hid in the back for a while saw me coming in. You call this customer service?? Horrible</Review>

A wonderful park used by neighborhood walkers and families. Park is divided into multiple area, one for the baseball diamond and other for the children activity area.

I do hope that the children area rebuild gets done soon.. it is over a year and the children really miss swinging and climbing here!!<//text>

This is a very nice little park. There is small hall that you can rent for special events. Beautiful place to watch little League basball game and nice little bbq area. There is a BRAND NEW playground being constructed and I am beyond excited to see how it turns out.<//review>

This is a nice neighborhood park. Their are limited BBQs and picnic tables. The park is also the site of the local Little League park. There are public restrooms that are open during park hours.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a very beautiful place, unfortunately many of the people who go with their dogs do not pick up their pupu, it is everywhere more in the part next to the Bryarwood school classrooms and even having bags and garbage cans, others put it in bags and leave it Thrown the bags everywhere.

(Original)
Es un lugar muy bonito lastimosamente muchas de las personas que van con sus perros no recogen su pupu esta por todos lados más  en la parte junto a las aulas de la escuela Bryarwood y aún teniendo bolsas y basureros, otros lo ponen en bolsas y lo dejan tiradas las bolsas por todos lados.<//text>

Comfortable vibe, good and seemingly very authentic food, nice owner. Not to be confused with the previous Mongolian restaurant that occupied this location.

Ate:
Khuushuur (meat pastries)
-Very good. A larger portion than I expected. I haven't had this version of the dish before but I've eaten chebureki (the Russian version of the same thing) many times, and this is a good rendition. (To the person who posted the video of draining juice out of the inside of their pastries -- at least if it's like the Russian version, this is exactly how it's supposed to be, rich and juicy inside.)

Buuz
-Like a drier but chewier version of soup dumplings. I've never had a dumpling with meat inside that was this chewy (in a good way). Yummy.

The owner was extremely friendly and chatted with me and my friend and ended up bringing us an extra beer on the house!< /Text>

These guys are insane! They took a restaurant that was down on it's luck and turned it around. You want great Mongolian food, authentic at that? This is your destination! All of the food that we have tried there is really good and tasty, the portions are good, the food is hot, the food will make you think of an older time out on the Mongolian Steppes. They got it right, give them a try!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Great authentic Mongolian restaurant. The only authentic one in all of California i believe. I really liked the Buuz and Khuushur. Everything here is handmade and there is a homely vibe here. Since everything here is made from scratch there is a little wait for your food. Other restaurants just freeze and microwave their food but not here!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My only experience with Mongolian food is the BBQ on the round top grill. You get in a line and stuff frozen strips of meat into a bowl, then veggies, top with some sauce and then hand to a cook who uses two sticks on a round grill to cook up your own creation. While this was always a fun and tasty experience, it definitely felt pretty westernized.

Togi's is a traditional, sit down, restuarant. They have an off Japanese restaurant type of feel, which includes bar/counter seating that looks oddly like a sushi restaurant. Maybe remnants from a prior proprietor? No matter, the food is unique and tasty.

I tried the first dish on the menu, which after ordering looks to be what every table in the place also ordered. It was called Tsuvian and was a noodle dish that came with stir fried meat and veggies mixed into the noodles and served on a hot cast iron plate. The flavor was not heavily spiced, but did not lack flavor. The noodles were delicious and highlighted the natural flavor of the meat and veggies.

The experience here left me curious about other dishes that are unique to Mongolian cuisine. I will likely be back here soon to try more!< /Review>< username>

<userid>109762142759699630289< /userid><Text>I lived in the neighborhood for over a year before I finally came to Tugi’s (pronounced TOE-GEEZ) I had never eaten Mongolian food. It’s a fusion of East Asian flavors and what I associate with Russian food. My favorite things on the menu are the Tzu Van (homemade noodles with meat and vegetables), Khuu Shur (meat pastries), Buuz dumplings) and the traditional meatballs with mashed potatoes. These items are all heavy, comfort food, but they also have a yummy house salad. The traditional milk tea is sort of salty, not my taste. It’s not a sweet milk tea, but it’s also comforting. Every time I have eaten here it’s the same waiter who is very kind and attentive. Highly recommend!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I lived in Mongolia, and this is the real deal, authentically Mongolian. Also some of the best Mongolian food I've had. Try the traditional milk tea, the tzu-van (noodles), buzz (steamed dumplings), and the khuu-shur (fried meat pastries).  Friendly service too.< /Text>

The portions are really big, and the service was great.<//Text>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Good service today, good food ...
The service is good and the food is delicious.
The pancakes were frozen, fried, with a little oil ... I wanted to improve the interior.

This place was sold to another owner.  There is no longer same day service but the company continues to advertise this service to get you through the door, DECEPTIVE.

The service went from good to poor, most employees left and no one is really left to clean your clothes.

Yes they were good before but went downhill rapidly. New owners didn’t even find the decency to communicate changes.

THIS IS A LOOSING PROPOSITION AMD A BUSINESS TO AVOID .</Text>

My go-to cleaners! In fact, I don’t go anywhere else anymore.  I’ve recommended Shelton Family Cleaners to several friends. They’ve always done a great job with my clothes and the prices are UNBEATABLE!! Great customer service as well. Definitely recommend!!<//Text>

I really like there laundry fluff & fold service
I like my clothes to smell nice after they have been washed so I give them dryer sheets to dry with clothes and they have no problem doing that. They also hang up all my t-shirts on hangers due to I don't like them wrinkled when I wear them. They definitely go above and beyond that's why I always keep coming back. Also there staff is very nice & polite.<//text>

My Dad referred me to this neighborhood cleaners. They had quick service, my garments were ready in less than  48 hours and the price was right. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.</Review>

I heard about this place when somebody on Facebook was asking about dry cleaners. One price per item. Lovely staff. Rather tricky to find unless you're heading north on Van Nuys north of Chandler. A new favorite.</Review>

<text>I was hesitant bringing my clothes to Sheltons but due to so many good reviews I gave it a try. Though my clothes look good when picking up, It concerns me that they don’t look at the clothes for any spots on clothing to note where spot cleaning may be necessary. Some things I have spilled on clothes cannot even be seen when brought in.  Ex. Coffee on a black sweater.  Of course for what they charge I guess you can’t expect that level of service. Other than my concerned thoughts, they are very nice and take care of you promptly.  I have been back there at least 5 times and I just started going there.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I am very satisfied with this establishment, every time I step in I get a friendly and genuine smile from the staff, generally they do a very good job, there hasn’t been a time where I needed to go back to correct something cause everything they do they do it right. The prices are awesome (can beat that), they’re prompt and well organized, I strongly suggest you to try it and you’ll never go anywhere else...</Review>

< Review>
Appears not to live up to their reputation at the newly opened Sherman Oaks location.  Next day cleaning is really three days.  I asked for individual bagging of my garments but said  they cannot do it.  Further, I'm reluctant  to have them clean garments costing more than $25.00.  This is their limit on liability if they loose or damage a garment.  Got it by reading the fine print on the receipt.

When compared to other cleaners they fall short.  This may be due to the pricing of $2.50 per garment.  Good price needs improvement on service<//Review>

My experience at Marina Village West has been wonderful. Not only has the office and maintenance staff been timely and professional but they have been courteous and efficient. The old trees and surrounding property provide a warm and welcoming return home. I would not hesitate to recommend this property to any professional moving to Stockton!<//text>

I have lived here for over a year and it has been a great experience, the management replies quickly to emails and has the maintenance team take care of maintenance issues within the day, which is very nice. Sometimes the security people leave rude comments on your car that management doesn't follow up on, which leads me to believe they don't know the security people are doing it. But besides the security officers, it has been a great experience and a wonderful first apartment.<//Review>

They have acted on everything I have ever asked of or requested immediately with professionalism.  Ty for that even accommodated a handicap parking for my mom in front of apartment.  One minor thing lol when gardeners blowing leaves seems to get under door at times maybe a better door sweeper I believe its called. Ty for all you have done all of you.</review>

Moved in Oct 2020 into a 2 bed 1 bath. It’s beautiful. The best thing about this complex is the maintenance! They don’t skip corners. The front office folks are also so helpful any request we have they respond swiftly and always fix my problems. Thanks MVW!< /Review>

I love my new apartment. I don’t know why people are saying they had roaches or that maintenance didn’t respond in a timely manner but every time I called for an issue they came out quickly to fix any problem I had ever had I have been here almost 1 year and the staff in the office has been amazing and I highly recommend these apartments to anyone looking for a place to stay. You can’t believe everything you read. Some people bring nasty things with them and then want to provide bad reviews. Marina Village west is really a beautiful and well kept place to call home. Highly recommend< /Text>

Well I’ll start this off with us having high hopes for these apartments. At first we were very content with these apartment until
The management had switch multiple times. The first apartments we had caught fire an the fire alarm did not work. The fire chief made sure to call the landlord and tell them that they were suppose to do checks to ensure they work which they obviously did not. The management had switched the next year after we had got moved into a different unit and during the switch if manage the very next month they had lost my rent when I had video proof of me paying for the money order and a receipt and I still had to pay another $700. Well We thought it might be over but we had multiple damages in the apartment that we had put request in for them to fix which they did not repair. Not only these incidents but here is another for you... I notified Robert that we would more then likely be moving out which he didn’t not make notes off and I also asked for paperwork via email which I did not receive.. now they are telling me I have to pay for July even when I told them it shouldn’t be my fault you did not provide the paperwork for me to deny resigning. I want to end this with Robert was a very well dressed and respectable gentleman but I now have to take legal terms to handle their unorganized business.  On a scale of one out of five stars I rate them a 2. Do not recommend living here.</text>

One of the BEST located properties and management groups for apartments in Stockton. Marianne the manager genuinely cares about answering your questions and making sure the property meets and exceeds your expectations. She's one of the hardest working, most caring people I've EVER met and made my time here for 2 1/2 years the BEST she could.

Remember kindness goes a long way if you ever have an issue that needs to be resolved.  She was ALWAYS willing to help provided I communicated and was kind in my requests.

Call them TODAY, enjoy, and make the MOST of your stay! :)<//text>

<Date>1587194263217</Date><Review>I do not recommend living here. I had a bad experience. When I initially moved in my apartment was infested with roaches and it took almost 2 months for them to move me to a different apartment. The rent is outrageous(do not get fooled by the price they give you) and I was paying close to $1,300 a month for a small 1 bedroom apt (even though many of my neighbors were paying a lot less) and I confronted management and they replied my lease was different from theirs. There's no assigned parking lots so goodluck finding any. Also when moving out, management did not do a walk through of the apartment with me and I lost most of my down payment and got charged with a lot of misc charges such as "white single fold towels".< /Review><gmapID>0x80900ea8a4e022b5:0xeb952c6570b79b59< /gmapID>< userid>

One of the best, peaceful apartments and neighborhoods to live in around Stockton. The staff was awesome and answered every concern promptly. I lived here for exactly 1 year and if my father hadn't passed away I would have stayed longer. Thank you to the Staff at Marina Village West Apartments. You all are awesome. 😃🖒</Review>

Don’t rent here. Ask to have a tour at night. You will be disgusted to find cockroaches crawling throughout the grounds. Thousands of them. In the pool and hot tub area, on the walking paths through the parking lot and infesting the apartments. You can’t walk a few feet without stepping on huge cockroaches.

The gates are left open all day. Don’t let the manicured grounds fool you, burglaries happen during the day because people are allowed to walk in through the open gates from 9am-6pm daily.

The keyed gates are left open by residents. So anyone can walk right in and burglarize.

Don’t expect to go to work and return home to find parking. There is not enough parking for each apartment.<//text>

The only thing is I wish they cared about the inside of the apartments as much as they do the outside. The grounds are always beautifully taken care of and I noticed they are doing some comsmetoc upgrades. But the insides are really dated. Old 70s 80s appliances, popcorn ceilings, outdated cabinetry... I really wish they would pay more attention to making those kind of changes rather than curb appeal. Hopefully in the future. Other than that.. it’s a great place.< /text>< Rate>

<text>Hopefully this review will at least save someone the stress, headache and problems that this place will cause you if you move in. This place is not only infested with roaches, but also has spiders that crawl on you and bite you while you sleep. The parking isn't assigned so you will have to walk across the entire complex 95% of the time , just to get to your apartment. There's  homeless people digging through dumpsters, all maintenance workers that I have dealt with , don't speak English too well , so you can't express to them what the problem is. You have to call and  complain over and over to get anything fixed, because they will cancel on you over and over. My upstairs neighbor flooded his apartment from doing god knows what upstairs , and water poured all though the walls and leaked into the floor and soaked the carpet from the bedroom closet to the living room closet. They said they were doing a full extraction , but they never did, no doubt the walls and insulation was soaking wet, all they did was cut a piece of sheet rock from the bathroom ceiling that was bubbled up and sagging from water that flooded the place. And painted it and called it "fixed" I wouldn't be surprised if black mold was growing in there. I feel bad for the next victim, ahem.. I mean tenant that  moves in there. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. The rent is a rip off too. Don't be fooled by the green grass and flowers and external appearance of the buildings! They will also steal all of your deposit money no matter what! There job here is too rip you off. Read all the other negative reviews, I'm surely not the only one.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<username>Paula Ogden</username><date>1521582523709< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have lived at the Marina Village West Apartments TWICE in the last ten years.  First in a two bedroom with patio, which was very comfortable and well maintained.  I moved when I purchased a house and I never had a bit of problem receiving my deposits or negotiating any of my paperwork.  Marianne is terrific and so is her staff, but you have to be responsible for your own communication.  Seriously, as a tenant, I never had a problem with maintenance or anything else, so long as I communicated my needs to the office (respectfully) and gave them enough time to correct my concerns.  When I look at some of these other reviews I believe that some reviewers lose sight of the fact that as a tenant, you become responsible for creating the kinds of relationships you are going to have in this kind of living environment; you have neighbors; you are a neighbor, so be a good one.  As far as the front office, I can't imagine a more professional or caring staff available to you, the tenant.

I moved there a second time recently due to a house fire.  This time Marianne agreed to a short term lease for six months until my home was repaired.  Wow!  How accommodating is that?!!  Believe me, she could have gotten a longer lease in today's market, but as a previous tenant she considered my needs as a person.  Again, when I moved back home this November, I had no issue with deposits or cleaning.  Beyond being a respectful and obliging property manager, Marianne is a decent and considerate human being.  She does take the time to treat you like a person, as does her staff.

The apartments themselves are getting a little older, but are well maintained.  The grounds are immaculate and the TWO swimming pools and work out room are as clean and inviting as the landscapes.  You don't have to apartment shop for long to see what's available in Stockton.  I have referred two friends who have enjoyed living at Marina Village West as well.  I have to laugh; a lot of people have lived in these apartments at one time or another.  It is most likely due to their ideal location.  They are just far enough away from the freeway and close to shopping and the 24 Hour Fitness.

Well, that's all I've got.  Thanks to Marianne and her staff for their kindness during my last six month stay.  I appreciated every conversation, every cup of office coffee, and every fire insurance fax you sent for me.

Please, don't be fooled by these fake reviews. I lived there for a year and it was by far the worst apartments I lived in. CRIME everywhere!!!! Also, my stroller was stolen off my porch from guess who? The Maintenance guy, LOL. Management does nothing and their security sucks! Management even sent me a bill for a laundry machine that was in my apt that broke down. I refused to pay it since I had literally just moved in 1 month prior and it wasn't my fault. These slum lords deliberately tried to humiliate me by placing Eviction notices on my door for the complex to see. Not because I didn't pay my rent on time... No, it was because I refused to pay a repair bill that was not my responsibility. Burglaries happen all the time here including day time home invasions, police raids, car burglaries and thefts, etc... list goes on and on. So glad I left and I will never go back there or recommend someone to those apartments.<//Text>

<username>Bonnie Andorf</username><Time>1562714280950< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>This was our very first apartment and we absolutely loved it! We were scared to move out of our parents homes in Lodi to Stockton but it felt just as safe as Lodi. We lived here in a 1 bedroom for almost 9 months and paid $1,170 which was a little high but we felt it was worth it. We would not have moved out but we were lucky enough to buy a house right down the street because we loved the area lol. I’m not sure why people said there were cockroaches because we never saw one, maybe it depends on who your neighbors are or how clean your area is? We lived right off the street by Marianne’s apartment and it was always very clean. Our cars were always safe and our neighbors were very good. We shared walls with the model apartments so it was pretty quite. The laundry rooms were always clean. The pool always looked amazing and had happy families in it we just never got to use it lol. I use to clean houses so I left the apartment cleaner than I received it lol I also got back almost $800 from the $1,000 deposit we put down so if you don’t get your deposit back your probably not as clean as you think.  The only complaint I have was dogs being let out on their own without owners. One woman would always let her bull terrier out by itself and it tried to attack me multiple times! I should of complained about her but I didn’t want to cause problems. Also a lot of times when something is not working properly in your apartment and they put in a work order the maintenance workers never show up for their appointment. If you really want it fixed you better keep calling. Otherwise I highly recommend renting here to have peace of mind and professional managers.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80900ea8a4e022b5:0xeb952c6570b79b59<//gmap_id></record>

<review>A MUST SEE: I have to start off by stating that my story is very unique. I was at a point where I didn’t know what to do next, but Marianna, Community Manager and her colleagues at Marina Village West Apartment Complex has truly been my wife and my guardian angels sent straight from God. My wife traveled to Stockton, CA from Atlanta, GA for business the week of Sept 12th and ended up going into labor way before her expected delivery date of Dec 22nd. Our son is in critical condition status at the local hospital, and the doctors will not release him until he reaches his full term. Obviously, that mean I needed to find a place to live for the next three months. I went to every hotel that I was told was safe by our nurses and doctors to house my family (Hilton, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express, and Extended Stay) but the prices for three months equaled up to $11,050. I passed by Marina Village West and said to myself that this place looked really nice and safe.  I stopped by the leasing office on a Thursday afternoon and Marianna was working that day. She truly understood my situation and she exceeded my expectations. Too wrap up my story I am leasing a one bedroom apartment and she even helped my wife and I with critical items we needed to be comfortable within our apartment.  All I can say is please don’t go by the negative reviews others have posted because I guarantee that if the people who had positive experiences like me shared their comments this place would have a 5 star average. I am still working through my situation and hoping my son gains his strength to leave the hospital so we can go home, but in the meantime God is blessing us with individuals like Marianna who has made this situation bearable and memorable.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80900ea8a4e022b5:0xeb952c6570b79b59</Gmap_id>< rate>

<Text>Management is very Rude. We Had one little situation in two years of living here and Mr. DeAndre from office tells us “We act like we own the place” something residents don’t want to hear after paying 1300-1400 a month on time. We are planing to move asap after this incident. Respect is must don’t make people feel like you are doing them a favor. Ain’t no body living here for free.</Text><Response>None< /Response>< rate>

Applied here, gave them plenty of positive renting history along with a deposit. Took several days to hear a response. They didn't call me, I called them several times. And finally the manager (whom sounded high) said no you're denied. I asked why and she said ummmm a previous residence of yours wouldn't answer our questions. I said so you've had my application for several days and that's all you can tell me? Then she said, well I'm not the one who talked to them. Didn't mention anything about my girlfriend who also applied with perfect credit lol. Place is a joke. Out $60 worth of application fees. Not worth the $900 for a one bedroom with no washer/dryer either. They'll lie to you when you walk in trying to be super nice to you. Good luck!</review>

< Review>
I lived 6 months in this place with my family and do not recommend the place at all.

neighbors complain about everything (upset that children laught very strong, if they run around, put music at any time, etc) ...

wash in this place is horrible, you need to be close to the laundry because the other neighbors take out before your clothes come off the washer or dryer.

in the pool there is always a lot of people, stole almost all correspondence,
Other neighbors smoke a lot ...

and we had a huge RAT living in department for almost two months.

We had spiders in the department and the spider bit me in the face.

Really I hate this place, to expensive and they charge for everything< /Review>

<Review>This place has a little of everything. If you are in San Dimas,stop by and have Happy Hour appetizers with your favorite drink. You can watch your favorite teams play., while listening to some music. The service is  awsome,  love the waitress, everyone is ready to serve you with a smile. Food is great!< /Review>< pictures>

The portion sizes were great and the aroma of the food was mouth watering but I was a little disappointed when it came to the taste. The beef patties were bland and tasteless. The patties also fell apart as if not properly prepared before cooking. I feel a bit divided. On one hand the fries were delicious, the buns were perfectly toasted and buttered, and the rest of the condiments were good. On the other hand, the tasteless beef patties just ruined an otherwise great first time experience. I hope this was just a one time thing. Maybe next time I go it will be better. Next time I’ll order something to drink and maybe some appetizers. I enjoyed the old western style exterior and surrounding area. Reminded me of the old western town at Knotts Berry Farm. Overall, pretty good food but could have been better.< /review>

1/1 point for good service
1/1 point for the good atmosphere
0/3 points for food

I personally ordered the loaded fries ( fries with random spots of cheese and burnt bacon). It should have cheese all over the fries with crispy bacon. However, the bacon was hard and looked like charcoal.
The spinach and artichoke dip was terrible and I have no idea how to fix that.
Chili burger which probably had the worst chili I’ve ever had, it was over salted, minimal meat, and had this odd flavor I couldn't figure out. The meat of the burger also had this old age taste from either improper storage or a poor supply. The food was all over salted, which is an understatement. The guests with me felt the same way. The main symptom here seems to be overzealous salt, a pinch is needed not a handful. Needless to say, I wouldn’t return. This is unfortunate because I did like the place itself but the food was awful.</text>

I came here for a work social and had a blast. Happy Hour is from 2-7, which was awesome, and the drinks were good. They had all of the specific liquors we asked for and were able to make any of the drinks we wanted. Their house drinks are unique and recommendable, which is why they get 5 stars.

The service was a little slow, but I was at a party of 15 so I can't fault them much. Would definitely recommend them to my friends!< /Review>

Staff is always friendly, beer is always good. Old Rasputin (XI) is my favorite on the menu (11% AbV), but their house beers are good as well - always give the local/house beers a chance before anything else! The food is really good, too!</text>

<text>On May 21, 2019, around 8:00 pm. I asked for a second  beer and the waitress decided not to give me my drink and talked to another customer for 30 mins. I then approached her and asked her calmly to cancel my second order of the beer. I only was able to have one drink and she charged me 2 drinks. She never gave us her name. (She appears to 5 feet tall and has black hair)<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Very fun .. been there with my co workers alot. Once
a month but sometimes the waitress( same one always) acts like it's a burden to split checks and shes always all stressed out. She said there can only be 3 total checks because it's too busy with other customers when there are 9 of us. I understand it can get too compicated but when we split the checks it  gets complicated as well!.some of us leave earlier than the others so it's not always convenient.  Love the atmosphere but might switch our once a month get togethers somewhere else. Where we dont feel like the waitress is so bothered.< /text>

<Review>As far as any  other sports bar, it's  fine. Prices  were raised since opening. $9 for a Chili dog and barely any fries is way too steep ( below average dog) I still like house beers though.<//Review></record>

<Text>Awesome place - great food and great customer service.  Used to be Clayton's. New owners have opened a great place with great local atmosphere where you can just hang out or watch the sports on TVs that are everywhere.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Good food and service. Sports type bar but the TVs were not loud which allowed a conversation to be had without shouting.< /Text>

< Review>
The food here is much better than when it was previously Clayton's. I especially like the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the tri-tip sandwich. You know you have a winning place when the tri-tip sandwich comes with au jus and horseradish. Offering fried tater tots for a side is genius.< /Review>

<text>We went here with friends who r into IPA's myself not so much though I do enjoy lighter craft beer e.g 805, Shock Top. I'd been here when it was "Clayton Brewhouse and Eatery" the decor was still the same plain but clean, neat, open/roomy which is great for ADA (wheelchair ♿) customers, seating is standard tables or bar seating or high tables & stools in the bar area, the new owners had taken over a couple months earlier as they informed me, they were friendly, seemed to be checking out the place for new changes i.e signage I assume. It wasn't to busy but there was a flow of people coming & going.
As for food this had good flavor it arrived promptly it was hot, the pizza was nice size with good/ampel fresh ingredients, we also had 🌶Chile Bean bowl not very spicy/hot but good flavor & Wings, both had really good flavor the wings were crisp & juicy, pizza was cooked well not mushy or over cooked too crispy or over cheesed or sauced.
Our server was friendly, checked on us & talkative willing to advise when asked about a menu item if she'd tried it,
Looks as though they do have a good variety of 🍺beers IPA's, Crafts etc. there were bout 12-15 choices from standard crafts 805's to beers I'd never herd of & they offer a small sample if requested, buying the wine bottle is a better deal then by the glass FYI & the wine drinkers did enjoy the wine.
📺TV's are a plenty thru out the restaurant seems like a great place to watch whatever sport your into
Easy to find rt off the 57 freeway (east) behind Zendejas, give this place a try if you haven't since the change o ownership.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Moderate taste, my spring dosa was on a diet it seemed like, not comparable to the pic on the menu (see attached).

For the prices they charge, there are other delightful options with better taste and lower prices.

will have to work on all aspects to survive.</Review>

Food is good. Kept one star because they messed up the orders, not just ours but another one at next table. It took them 20 mins to bring my last dish on order after that. Would have still given 5 stars if that order was for me but it was for 3 year old who had a hard time wauting for it.</review><time>1546288783267<//time><user>108522923901568976380< /user>< Pics>

They didn't take our order properly. This led to half of the group getting food in 15min and the rest half after 40min. In meanwhile, instead of fixing the mistake by cooking for our order, they served the food to all the other tables and got back to us after everyone is done. This is quite unprofessional.
They ran out of tissues pretty fast too.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Tasty food and good service. Though the place is a little smaller but go during non rush hour and you will enjoy food without much waiting. I like their combo thalis and options. I guess this is gonna be our  regular to go  place now.</Review>

<Review>Happened to be in the south bay for some work stuff, and on my way back did the "ok Google, show me Indian restaurants on the way" and this was one of the first options. And I'm like - huh, a dosa place that I haven't seen before?!
Anyways, dropped in. It's inside a strip mall, and so the space is VERY limited. There was a group of 4, who were waiting before me. I was alone, so I didn't have to wait for a seat.
You order at the counter. The prices are pretty good. I got the Madras coffee for $2.49, and the Madras or Bombay, I forget, masala dosa, for $9.99.
The dosa was yummy! And filling! Took longer than I would expect, but came out super hot. It was hard for me to break pieces off of it for a good two minutes. The lady at the counter said it'll be spicy, but it really wasn't. Though, like I said, yummy dosa - might be a little better than Madras Cafe even! The coffee was really good too. And very hot.

Now my gripes with the place.
Service is either bad, or non existent. I saw 3 people who work there overall, including the lady at the counter. She was pretty friendly, and good at explaining menu items if you're new to dosas (I saw a couple of people who came in after me, who most probably had never had dosa before).
The second guy was mostly cleaning tables, so I didn't really interact with him.
The third guy was very not friendly at all. Not particularly rude, but has this forever frown -y face.

Also, things move pretty slow in there. I asked for my coffee as soon as the dosa came out, and either they forgot or they're just slow, but it took another 5+ minutes before the coffee came out.
Similarly, I asked for a little extra coconut chutney (which, Madras Cafe makes better, BTW), when the little bit they gave, ran out, and it took a while for that to come out. Also, it was generally pretty hard to get someone's attention.

I still give it 4 stars because of the food. And the service part is something they should be able to fix easily. Give it a shot, but if you prefer faster, better service, and very similar food, go to Madras Cafe.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fbbd999b82e1f:0x56b4eb63706a8a8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went to this place today for the first time. It is different from most traditional Indian places, in that the food taste like it was cooked in home.  The food has its natural flavors and not overpowered by hot chilly taste.</Text>

We ordered idli and paneer dosa. Their paneer dosa is amazing. This place is not much of an ambience, go here if u r looking for good food and can compromise with ambience.< /Review>

Very good food, shared parking .. gets busy during peak hours, friendly staff but needs more staff, online order for pickup still not ready so try calling them to order, (doordash, GrubHub ready though), seating is limited</review>

<Text>Updating review : The restaurant has been closed for repair or something but Google shows as open. My parents visited them for lunch on Wednesdays twice more than a week ago. Both times the place was closed and they had to turn back home. Please update on Google search if you are open or not. It can be done using GMB app.

Old review: Ordered idli & dosa n aloo paratha. Idli n dosa were very authentic n will order from them more. They need to decrease wait times when we go in person.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

New Indian place on Rengstorff. We've been there a few times now. Food is always fresh & good, service is great. My favorites are the dosas (duh :)), sambhar vada and filter coffee. Place itself is quite small. Go during off peak hours to find a spot quickly and eat calmly. Big groups may find it tough to find a spot here. During peak hours, get your food to go:)</text>

The dosas were okay and the coconut chutney was not great. The idlis though were amazing; were really soft and almost melted in my mouth. Heard the parathas are better so might them next time.<//text>

Such a wonderful place! Great food, super authentic flavours and smells, just like in india. Beautifully designed, great atmosphere and service. We loved it!
Manu vegan options, nitice that the sambar though isnt vegan as it has ghee (but it is served on the side). The doshas were phenomenal!< /Review>

Just tried this place as it is very close to my house.
Aloo paratha was OK. Dosa/idli/Gobi paratha were good. They have very little seating arrangement which keeps on changing. Would appreciate if they solve it.< /text>

I have done a couple of take outs from the newish restaurant and overall I like their food. The first time, we got samosas to go - however the quality of the samosas were ok. Not bad, but not very good either. The second time around, we ordered a couple of parathas and chana those were really tasty. The parathas worked really well with the raita and the chana was really tasty too. I'd love to get a meal there in person soon!<//Review>

1. Inefficient management and no cordination between servers and table cleaning.
2. Ordering system is chaoctic.
3. Management straight up lies about wait time
4. Serving dishes out of order. People who came much after us were already served.
5. Unhygenic seating arrangement
6. Food taste was just ok. Nothing great.

Would not recommend and bring friends here.</Review>

Really like the food here. Came across the place recently so me and my wife decided to check out the place. It is a small place but the food is great. We had the paneer paratha which came piping hot and ate two pieces per plate and served with raita and pickle. We always tried mylapur masala dosa which was also different but great. It has podi chutney and onion filled inside along with masala. They serve many other delicacies which I plan to try out in the months to come.< /Review>

Took in a Trek to convert the gear system into something more my style. Requested it only be done if they thought it would work and last for the ride style and terrain I was planning it for. And that I ride pretty rough, and daily.
...
If perfect is actually a thing, they made it happen.

After over a year riding it every day since... It's a dream. There's no way I can state how absolutely incredible the bike has been with the conversion. Rides like it's doing a film shoot. Director and cast all in tears from the performance.

Very good place to get your bike rolling the way you want.</Text>

Great shop. They helped me with my cleats that were squeaking while riding.  Most appreciated.  My riding buddy needed a new tire and was able to get one and use their floor pump after he replaced the wormed out tire.  My friend and I were able to sit in the shade by the front of the shop.  Good place.  Thanks</Review>

Randomly stopped to look at kids' bikes. Son immediately saw one he liked. Trek is a solid brand and the service was great and friendly. Fast as well, and with kids around, that's important.< /Text>

<review>Friendly staff and good customer service.  Shopping experience felt a little rushed due to the current COVI 19 situation. Felt they could attend three customers at a time if they keep them 20 feet apart and brought the products to them and establish a rotation system to make sure all customers had a chance to see the products they want to shop for. Overall, following the COVID19 protocols and maintaining a professional environment.</review>< GmapID>

I’m constantly impressed with the level of customer service and quality of products at Epicenter Cycling. I went in recently to have a new Ritchey stem put on my road bike for a better fit, as well as having my saddle adjusted. The service was efficient and personable, and I left knowing my rides are going to be more comfortable from here on. I also needed to exchange a pair of clipless shoes, and again received superb customer service. This is definitely my go-to bike shop—the guys who run the place are knowledgeable, patient, and have never tried to up sell to me or push me to buy something that I didn’t need. That level of trustworthiness will keep me as a loyal customer for as long as I live in the area!<//Text>

Came in May 17 asking about a tune up. They said, bring your bike. Came back with my bike May 31, they said, make an appointment. You want to be sure you're wearing bike shorts, and clip shoes for these dudes, nothing like good old biking for fun. Oh, and bring your bike in to schedule an appointment for a month out.</review>

As you can see by our 4.9 star rating, we are dedicated to providing stellar customer service. Please know we are doing our very best to keep up with the recent biking surge. Our service procedure is to see the bike first to evaluate when we can take care of it, then to have the customer take the bike home until the service appointment. Unfortunately, we don’t have storage space to hold all the bikes due to the demand for service. We’d like to make things right with you though!

<Review>Rented a bike and used their shuttle for Demo Forest and everything was fantastic. Great advice on which trails to ride and provided several alternative options for the brutal climbs which were very helpful.  Only had one day to ride this time out so I'll definitely be coming back for some more Demo trails and shuttle goodness.</Review>< Pictures>

Too many bike stores are run by pushy salespeople, so it's nice to feel comfortable shopping casually.

Hands down the most friendly and knowledgeable staff in the area.  Yes the bikes are awesome, yes the prices and the free tune ups for life are really great, yes it's right next to some world-class trails, but the atmosphere and community is why you should go to Epicenter.  I had been to 4-5 other shops and now I'm never going anywhere else.

John and Vanessa are especially cool if you get a chance to work with them.<//text>

<text>There are many great bicycle shops in Santa Cruz. I chose to go to this one because my friend bought his bike here and had good things to say.
I went in to replace a tube, and get some tools and information so I could do it myself in the future. Everyone was great, and Im pretty confident that I can change my tube in the future - maybe not as quickly, but you know, baby steps.
They have several female mechanics and female staff.  Things like that are important to me.
Thanks ladies!< /text>< username>

Fantastic staff! My husband and I ended up having to go to both stores the Aptos store and the Santa Cruz store since we were at the Aptos store but the Santa Cruz store had a bike that I wanted. All the staff at the Aptos store went out of their way to help us from one staff (Kenny I believe) calling the Trek credit department because I didn’t have my card, another staff member ( I can not remember his name 😕) installing the bike carrier on the back of our suburban and showing my husband how to use it. Then finally Matthew helping me actually pick out a bike and helmet and everything else he was extremely patient with my pickiness and lack of knowledge on the bikes. At the Santa Cruz store we were helped by Chris who even though it was closing time was still very patient with us and helped fit me on the bike and made all the adjustments it needed. He took his time and made sure I was comfortable leaving with the bike with no more questions and even recommended a great place to eat!</review>

< Review>
I visited this wonderful shop in April.  I had been shopping for a bike from Livermore down to Aptos and by far this was the best shop in the Bay Area.  They fit me on a bike, changed out the stem, watched me ride, etc.  The only personalized service I have ever gotten.  Awesome!</Review>

I fouled my chain badly and thought I was looked at a wrecked gear train.  The mechanic freed the chain, carefully inspected the chain and sprockets, explained what he was doing, relubricated the chain, assured me there was no damage, adjusted the derailer, carefully wiped all the grease off the bike, and returned the bike to me without charge (because I bought it there), all in about 10 minutes.  This is not the first time I have had great service, both here and at the west Santa Cruz location.< /review>

(Translated by Google) On the website he says he rents bikes and where it is true, he walks 20 minutes for nothing. Don't rent a bike !!!

(Original)
A la pàgina web diu que lloga bicicletes i on és veritat, camines 20 minuts per res. No rent a bike!!!</review>

{'time': 1544992005173, 'text': "Hi Deborah, I'm following up on past reviews and was able to translate your comment. Curious as to what you mean by having to walk for 20 minutes? It would be helpful to understand your complaint better so we can ensure we're offering the best possible service as customer care is our #1 priority. Thank you so much! ~Michele"}</response>

< Review>
This place is a gem. $30/hour for a foot and back massage. It’s no frills, but foot massage places never are. If you’re looking for a luxury spa experience, this is not for you. If you’re looking for an incredible massage with strong pressure, go here. Also, please tip well. These therapists work really hard and often do massages back to back to back. Your $5 tip is not good enough. Tip at least 50% for a job well done. The massage is cheap enough to afford it.  — Also, I’ve gone several times since being vaccinated, and the staff are all wearing masks, giving hand sanitizer, washing hands, etc. I’ve never seen any customers not wearing masks either. Everyone is pretty respectful and everything is clean.</Review>

Used to love this place! Now....the foot massage technique is sloppy and the back...he was basically just stabbing me with his elbows, ELBOWS!
but also the employee greeted me WITHOUT A MASK. There was another customer receiving massage right after me WITHOUT A MASK.</review>

<text>Came to Sunny Foot Massage because my friend strongly recommended it. We went together, she had a great experience with a therapist called Pancake. Mine therapist was not as strong as Pancake. (Forgot her name) She couldn't give me the right points pressure. After all, I have been doing massage for over 15 years I know what the best is.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2bf5437696949:0x2ba289a13e6a571< /gmapID></record>

My body and feet were in bad shape after 30+ miles of walking. I didn't know what to expect because I had never had a traditional Thai massage. This is now my preferred type of massage, and they have set the bar high for what to expect elsewhere! Liz was my masseuse, and she was amazing! The place was so calm and clean, the people were so communicative and kind. I will visit every time I'm in CA!</review>

<review>This was my first thai massage and I really enjoyed the experience.  Patrick, my masseuse, did an amazing job. After he was completed, I felt really relaxed and ready for a chill evening.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone. I would probably have never booked this but won a gift certificate from an ALC fundraiser.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x80c2bf5437696949:0x2ba289a13e6a571<//GmapID>< name>

<Review>Great massage at a great price. Splurge for the 90 min it's totally worth it. I do ask for oil but you can go without if you prefer. They do get in there and hurt you good so if you want a little lighter massage just ask as they will adjust to your needs. The masseuses I have had so far have all been pretty good at gaugeing my comfort level during the massage. I highly recommend this establishment.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

What a great place for reflexology and Chinese massage. I felt uplifted after my reflexology session. The staff does know what they are doing unlike other places where the massage might be mediocre.</review>

<Review>Hate to leave a good review because people will find out that this is the best massage I have had anywhere.   Clothes are left on and other people talking quietly can be disruptive,  but hands down the best  massage I have EVER had.   Please tip generously,  as they  work hard for it.<//Review><user_id>110525214294517747524< /user_id>< GmapID>

<Review>This place was horrible. Bad service the massage were done out in the open. No privacy all types of noise via telephone, talking. Rough handling of body parts and bad communitcation. I could go on and on. Never will I go back< /Review><rating>1</rating>< Gmap_id>

Got here at 11:10am on Tuesday. They wouldn't give me a massage :0/ said they were not open yet???? Lame!!! My feet were killing me and I had about 1 hr. Before going to work. So I wanted a 30min foot just to be able to walk with some relief . Oh well. Guess I'll never know :0/< /Review>

<Review>If I could give this place no stars I would. WORSE PLACE EVER. Don't know what was worse.... him stabbing me with his elbow in my spine or yanking my skin off my head with him scratching it. Kept telling him to go softer, all he did was laughed and continue to do it hard. The foot massage was so bad that he cut my pinky skin when he rubbed the towel to clean me off. I thought it was just me but my sister had the same experience. No lie... has soon as it was over we both looked at each other and said  ..NEVER AGAIN.... left with a headache and feeling worse then when I got there. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE 😨😡🖓<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Maggie Marmol< /user_name>< Pics>

Sunnys is my favorite spot in LA (and beyond) for a quality rub down and their amazing prices allow me to visit every week! It's impossible to leave this place without a huge smile on your face and muscles feeling like jello (in the best way). These guys know what they are doing. They work you from the tippity top of your head all the way down to your little baby toe. They take their time (never gyp you on the hour) and throughout the massage they check to make sure you are comfortable. Seriously you guys, I'm obsessed with this place. You gotta go!</Text>

I have gone to the S.F.M about 10 times now and look forward to my next visit which will be FREE! - The massage is great for that price. You have to request a strong masseuse if thats what you want & YES you get the deep tissue!!! --- And I tip $10 since it's so cheap at $25.  LOVE this place!< /Review>

<Text>The food is pretty good here but for the money I'd rather go somewhere else. If you come here you'll enjoy the food but you won't get as much here as you would at some other places.<//Text><date>1520232180314</date>< Gmap_id>

Been going for years. They're open for pickup and delivery. A South Lake institution. Noda is great. Try the Soju.< /Review>

I Love NODA's. Everytime I have guests from out of town, they always request to go to NODA's at least once or twice during their visit. Food is wonderful and abundant.  I don't like sushi but still go to NODA's offten for the chicken teriyaki, beef and gyozas. Good friendly atmosphere and very reasonable prices.< /review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Located on Lake just past T-Pumps. The restaurant is small bit quaint with several tables and sushi bar seating. Staff are attentive and helpful. However there were only 2 waitstaff available when I was there and they appeared very busy. One more floor staff member would have been useful. Sushi was fresh and quality was fair. Pricing is reasonable for food and beverages. Seemed like a lot of regular diners and the staff treated them very well. Overall not a bad sushi restaurant on Lake in Pasadena.<//Text><user_name>Stephen Harvey</user_name><Date>1554230174768</Date></record>

Love all the sushi I've tried there (rainbow, salmon avocado, dragon rolls) and the miso soup. Fast service, not loud. I plan on coming back whenever I get the craving for sushi!< /review>

<Date>1403294587760<//Date><response>None< /response><text>Not too bad, but still forgettable.

Stopped in for a lunch special and got a shrimp tempura roll, BBQ beef and the standard sides (rices, salad, miso soup) for about ten bucks.  Not too impressed with the beef and would not order that again.  Just not the amount of flavor and freshness I like.  Shrimp tempura was better, but still pales in comparison to Sushi of Naples which isn't too far from this place.

Glad I checked the place out, but I will stick with Sushi of Naples next time I'm craving something Japanese.<//text><UserId.>104484093626436841551< /UserId.>< user_name>

This place is cozy and delicious. Great for sushi or for a hot meal. We had vegetable udon with California roll and salmon teriyaki and both were great!</Review>

the gyoza is cold and the sashimi is not fresh at all. They just directly cook frozen gyoza. The price is freaking way higher than the food supposed to be. Sad there's no negative five star for this restaurant.<//review>

The sushi was okay, but the waitresses kept giving our orders to other tables. Twice! And they didn’t offer any recompense.</Review>

Its a Biglots! They have a lot of good stuff at reasonable prices. Food, bedding, kitchen, patio, and lots of other departments. Easy to get in and out of, with a big parking lot.</text>

If I need something quick and well priced this is a good place for me.  Also some interesting foods can be found that you might not ordinarily see. It is worth a trip.< /Text>

Hit or miss Went yesterday and found lots of great household items and gifts
Today the line was so huge with lethargic employees Waited for about five minutes, then they said they formed one line and put me at the back of it I had to give up and leave Nothing worth a half hour to pay for and being treated like cattle<//review>

Cheap items at cheap prices. My experience has mainly fallen under the "you get what you pay for category;" I've found I'd prefer to spend more initially on quality items than to have to visit discount stores on a more frequent basis.<//Review>

The most unsanitary retail store I have been in so far in my town, Watsonville  for covid-19. People shopping with no mask or not wearing properly. Check out-no disinfecting after each customer e.g., wiping down counters, credit card payment equipment, no one disinfecting carts, hand baskets etc. A table when entering with a bottle of spray foam (don't know what it was and a large roll of rest room brown hand paper towels on a large continuous roll.
In my county, Watsonville rates the highest covid 19 positives. Couldn't wait to get out to my car and squeeze my hand sanitizer. They did have a small make shift plexi glass shield for the checker but didn't cover much between you and that person, very narrow and looked to be portable as to move around. UGH!!! Hope I don't get infected. Stay Home!!!! Way more safe.< /text>

When I was quickly grabbing items I needed, another employee came up to me and reminded me it was almost their closing time.

The items on display for purchase do not always match the display price. Be careful. It seems like they're trying to confuse the customer in thinking the merchandise is less cost</text>

< Review>
I really like Big Lots Store because they have some items that I can't get anywhere else for the same price! Their prices are hard to beat, so I love going to Big Lots. Plus, they're really branching out with different food items! You can get some really cool edibles there, and even ORGANICS, for cheap! Also... Big Lots. Sells. MAKEUP!!! Yes, makeup! Also really well priced. Sometimes you can find really good quality cosmetics there, brands like Revlon, Almay, Cover Girl, L'Oreal, etc. Go check it out!<//Review>
