Super friendly customer service. I believe his name was Edwin, but he was super sweet and made the experience enjoyable. Only complaint is that the coffee never taste consistent, but other than that love the location :)< /Review>

Whether it's too much water to cold brew ratio, or too much half and half in my wife's coffee, resulting in having to microwave it to make it hot again. Just needs a little bit more finesse in the basic drinks.< /Review>< username>

< review>
I’ve been through the drive thru many times and every time it takes forever even when there is just 3 cars in front of you. Takes me more than 15 minutes just to get my drink every time. I’ve ordered mobile pickup in the lobby, but when I get there it’s closed when it says that they close later on that night so I had to wait in the drive thru to get my drinks which took more than 20 minutes 🤦🏽‍♀️< /review>

What's the point of doing mobile orders if they're going to make you go through drive through? The wait is ridiculous there were 2 guys standing at the door how about work on making our drinks or disable the order ahead option alot of us don't have time thats why we order ahead then once you get to the window we still have to wait for our drinks to be made.< /review>

< review>
By far one of the roomiest Starbucks location in the county. This was a former Burger King so the amount of space that is a commodity in other Starbucks locations is plentiful here. Been here twice, one mobile order and one walk in order, and I've had pleaseant experiences both times. Would recommend this place in a heartbeat if you want a sit down area to study.</review>

I will begin by saying that I love Starbucks. This particular location open very recently  and maybe that's why the service is lacking. Management: you need more baristas! The waits are long and the staff seems to always rushing. Please do revalue your staffing needs especially during peak hours!  I wish this location the best but something will have to change!!</Text>

<text>SOOOO EXCITED to have this store so close. It just opened up about a month ago or so.  They're still a little short staffed at times but the baristas do their best to get their drinks out as quickly as possible.
They've also been so great and welcoming to my brudder, a 21 year retired veteran who was shot in Afghanistan and is now paralyzed from the chest down. And when he doesn't come in with me, they always ask how he's doing. 💗 It's a small thing but it means a lot to know that they honor and respect my brudder and the hero that he is.  We definitely love coming here to check in with our baristas and see how they're doing!
Special s/out to Kayla, Mary, and Angel! Woot! Woot!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyYBqr4fF-llrCF7xRWYXiXBukdY39aqMrWT-q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPK-inWsLYyEx_4yr-qgj_hrj0wbIMnI3ga3zO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOU0tJswCwsdu2YvK3MYwV0ZOojE5Ycy4jplNu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrK41zNBABCZYBV6p5RCHnyLmXmqFnq7Zku45x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjwyVUNIA8SiaqFnK8yRljbvwRPpBFC2Iyt7DF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

There was no one in line and 7 employees behind the counter. I stood there for at least 5 minutes before anyone helped me. It appeared to me that only 2 to 3 employees were doing most of the work. I almost walked out. I will not be back to this one anytime soon. One of the worst customer service experiences I have had.

However, staff was unfriendly, didn't make eye contact. Bar was out of half and half. Had to be assertive to get a straw as staff ignored me. No cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla on the bar. Trash cans were overflowing. Music was too loud.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Utilizing an existing building allows for a ton of natural light as 2 of the walls are mostly window. The service, unfortunately, is slow. They are kind, and helpful most of the time, but I think they take for grantex that a lot of people go there to study for extended periods. When my mobile order says 1-4 minutes prep time, I can usually expect to see it out in 10 minutes, or so. Plan accordingly.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

People are nice, training is lacking with drink making.  They focus more on the process than the lobby.  Hard to get noticed when you need half and half carafes.
Their manager needs to be made aware of this.
Baristas are not properly trained on the refill policy.
Hope they improve as this is a nice facility.< /Review>

<Text>Waited a while to place my order, the person in front of me had no idea what they were ordering. My order was rung in correctly, but when the guy handed in to me it was wrong. So needless to say I had to wait longer for them to correct the order. Guess I should have figured how it was going to be judging the huge line in the drive thru.<//Text><time>1583462548280</time>< name>

Has a drive thru and huge dining area. The staff is amazing every time, drive thru or inside. My only qualm is that the homeless population thinks they own this starbucks. I was there for 30 minutes today enjoying my coffee inside and was approached at my table two times for money, the gentleman next to us had his deodorant and clothes spread out on the table, and there were dirty used socks on the floor near the bathroom. Will be sticking to drive thru from now on.

*2/17/19 I contacted Starbucks originally about the situation and they offered to send me an $8 gift card. I once again contacted them today because nothing's improved and they said thanks for letting us know and exitted out of the chat. It's getting to a point where I don't feel comfortable or safe coming to the Starbucks anymore.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd2935ab0ea389:0xcc28cc228ccb999c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The customer service is horrible. They don’t even greet you it’s ridiculous. I had to repeat my order multiple times to the lady taking my order. Mind you after all that my order was incorrect, and I didn’t receive one of the coffees I ordered. When I went to go clarify it to another lady she gave me a dirty look. It’s not my fault the person at register doesn’t know how to take orders. Never had to experience this type of mannerism at any other Starbucks. First impression failed.</Text>

<text>If you like having your orders made accurately then I suggest you go down the street to Chapman or to Harbor. I work in the plaza and have on multiple occasions asked for something relatively simple to have it made incorrectly; asked for a cafe vanilla was given plain vanilla bean, asked for one no whip and one regular caramel frap (my coworker doesnt like whip) to then be given 2 regular whip fraps (this happened twice), and now when giving them the same order with extra caramel had both no whips and no added extra caramel. I've had my espresso shot die on the counter and when I asked for a smoked shoulder bacon sandwich I was given double smoked bacon, cheddar, and egg sandwich (I dont like breakfast croissant). Not to mention there was someone in regular attire behind the bar making himself a drink. Point of the story is just drive the mile in either direction to the next Starbucks, they know what they are doing.<//text><gmapID>0x80dd2935ab0ea389:0xcc28cc228ccb999c<//gmapID>< time>

<text>This Starbucks has a lot of room inside, it's pretty large for a Starbucks. They do have a drive-thru as well of course. This location just opened and they only had about three staff members working right now. So some of the tables did need cleaning, there was a line inside, as well as in the Drive-Thru. Then again Starbucks seems to always have a line especially at any of their drive-thrus.<//text>< pics>

Pleasant atmosphere, Fair internet. But is a little bit expensive like all other Starbucks are.</Review>

They could not make drinks correctly, attempted 3 times, the tables and floor were dirty, and then tried to explain the way the drinks are made even after we told exactly what we wanted.<//text>

<text>Hum, chicken Caesar salad was soaked in salad dressing. The flavor was very strong. The chicken was good. But couldn’t eat because of the amount of dressing.  The calamari appetizer was all cold think batter. If there was calamari in the batter it was so chewy and no flavor it was terrible. The worse I think over vet had, dad to say.  Husband had the Beet salad,   Shrug.... sadly disappointing.  But they were very nice. Two salads were not ready when they said they would be. The one thing we ordered that should have been hot, guess they thought it need to be?< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1593559355423, 'text': 'hi Conway we apologize already 2 times and we ofer you can come to the place to replace you meal any time  thank you'}</Resp>< gmap_id>

The restaurant refused to accept Groupon.  The guy is also not professional.  Telling me that Groupon does not make sense.  Asked how much did we pay for the groupon?  However the company is running the promotion via Groupon but do not honor it.  Waste time to go there.  The restaurant was empty too.
I replied to the restaurant's owner that we were wearing mask.  You were not wearing mask when you came to talk to us with digital menu.  I also did not run away but you were asking how much I paid for the voucher and said that it does not make sense for me to accept.  I felt that I dealt with dishonest business.  You are running promotion in Groupon on the day that I came in to redeem.  But, you refused to accept voucher for either dine-in or take-out.  Good luck with your business. I am local and always see your place empty!<//review>

Was understaffed for Valentine’s Day. It took 2 hours for our entrees to come out. The food was fine, but the wait ruined the experience. There were about 7 couples there during our dinner, and 5 of them walked out without paying. I felt bad for the one server because everyone was complaining to him when it clearly wasn’t his fault. Something was happening in the kitchen because I have no idea how the experience could have been as bad as it was.<//review>

<text>So glad to see this restaurant transformed into a place with friendly owners and delicious food. My litmus test is the bolognese sauce and they pass, flying colors.  Previous visit, we tried their homemade ravioli and that was great too!

The host who moved here from Miami was very engaging and accommodating as we changed our order.. no weird attitude like previous owners.</text>< pictures>

Excellent wine. Food average, small portions, basic menu, overpriced. Bread was store bought sliced, very sad since they have a pizza oven and could easily make their own fresh. Hope they improve, nice to have a neighborhood bistro.<//Review>

Last week I was in San Jose for business. I heard about Mio Vicino in Santa Clara. I went and loved the food. While there I found out there was a second location in Saratoga. It was close to my hotel and I ended up going there the next night. Again, I was really happy with the food and the service.

This time I had the Strip Steak. It was great! Being from Texas originally I love steak. This one was right up there as one of the best I've ever had.

Another thing that really impressed me was what I noticed about the owner. He made it a point to talk to every person that came in. He was very personable and made people feel like family, like he had known them forever.

Great restaurant!!!</text>

To fake: these people are trying to hard. The bread basket with napkins, the menu is cheap and no effort, as well as the calamari, under cooked, salty. This place would be a good pizzeria.</text>

So I ordered it.....15 minutes later I was presented with my lunch, it looked odd as the cheese had not melted, but I gave it a try anyway.....I was surprised to eat a mouthful of COLD lasagna, I guess it needed another 2-3minutes in the microwave!
Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant. Pretty pathetic when the waiter says the best thing on the menu is lasagna and it is not even made fresh on a daily basis. I suspect this restaurant will not survive in Saratoga too long!<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

If u go back to my previous reviews it was all fake !!!  just  like most of this comments here that are by the same people that knows or worked for the owner!

This places is a joke and he keeps all Tips!!

I still need half of my salary pretty much and im getting ignored this is not fair after i work 6 days a week all day for a really long time !

A nice replacement for the casual Italian restaurant that had been in the village.  I like the selections, but i find the menu limiting.  As a low carb eater, the selections are limited.  But everything I've had here is good.< /Review>

<Review>It is a very decent place for the price. Food is not fancy, but fresh and well prepared. The service is friendly. It is a good choice if you do not have a big budget, you get good value for the price.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808e4ade0e69e489:0x698eac292458bf76<//gmap_id>< name>

Solid Italian fare with a few standouts,  like their grilled polenta with mushrooms and the shrimp pie (pizza full of shrimp.) A lot of good pasta dishes but lacks healthy food options. Wish they would make more greens and varieties of salads available. Stopped their lunch hours so dinner only.<//Review>

Food was ok. Service was poor trying to run the place with less employees. Had to wait a long time before food arrived even though less customers were there. A cafe should be quick or reasonable time. Wouldn't recommend this place< /text>

I'm giving 4 star just because the place was nice, the staff was friendly and the salad was good. However, the pizza was terrible, it was very watery and we had to eat it with a fork!!!<//text>

Originally known as Hollywood Studios, which first opened in 1919, later becoming known as General Services Studios. Such classic shows as Burns and Allen, I Love Lucy, Bob Cummings, Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Mr. Ed, and the Beverly Hillbillies were filmed here.</Text>

< Review>
The rudest people I have ever come into contact with! I called twice, and asked if this is Uber? Both times a woman said, sorry, we are not and hung up on me! There was absolutely no reason for her to hang up on me! I was not rude to her. I merely asked if I had contacted Uber!

Then I called a third time. By this time I was livid! I spoke to a person and explained that someone had hung up on me. I don't know if it was the same woman. She said, we are a production company, not the cab company, and then hung up on me again!!

I don't know how these people stay in business. I have NEVER EVER come across any receptionist that was this rude! Also, she was aware of how rude she was and clearly did not care!</Review>

Friendly staff, and easy process getting into our favorite late night show (@midnight (RIP)). They even took professional photos of us in front of the shows backdrop while we waited to be seated.</review>

Always be careful, getting into a car with a stranger carries its own risks, Most drivers are male and you cannot request a female driver. Remember a car is like a metal cage and the driver controls the doors.<//Text>

Working on the oilfields in Bakersfield Ca. NOT paid enough to drive around looking for oil leaks,and etc. there are so many dangerous hazards in the oilfields that are unpredictable. VERY little  training in the oilfields,but yet expected to know everything about the wells,steam,and crevasse’s. $13-$14 an hour is HORRIBLE pay for the on going hazards,and the later in life health problems from the chemicals that are a constant problem. NOT SAFE!! UNDERPAID,UNPREDICTABLE,UNACCEPTABLE,And NOT APPRECIATED for Hardwork. 8-12 hr shifts in these very dangerous hazards. NAH man I’m GOOD.<//review>

<UserId.>107255033121284680170< /UserId.><Review>Transwest only favors the lazy,and unprofessional employees. Being a good employee,and doing your job isn’t for this company,Or HR department. They do not care about the safety of their employee’s. As their number 1 concern is the client,not the employees. It’s very hard to advance with this company. And scheduling that’s a whole different story. Let’s just say they have their “favorites.” One employee can have 3 write ups,while another employee can have zero write ups. So,they keep the person with 3 write ups,and fires the good employee. ALOT of favoritism in the HR department,and scheduleing.<//Review>< gmap_id>

10:00am 01/28/2020 @ Human services dept
Never have I witnessed such a poor excuse for a security gaurd until today. The heavy set female hispanic guard ignored me as she continued to use her two cell phones. Clearly she does it on a daily basis since she had no shame on doing so right in front of the entrance. She doesn't care if there is security footage of her on her phone. Very Unprofessional. The fact that she represents your company looks awful for you.</review>

The interviewer did my husband, Jesus wrong! My husband has never lied since our life in faith and that demon had the audacity to accuse him of lying! He turned down a job thinking he was a part of your team due to that false testimony from that interviewer/lazy girl against my husband. She brought him to shame for thinking he found a place with great coworkers. PLEASE OPEN YOUR EARS NEXT TIME AND REPENT FROM THIS GRAVE SIN AGAINST A MAN & HIS PREGNANT WIFE! Pay the price for your consequences. If not then you are doomed as all sinners are.<//review>

She made contradictory statements which hindered employment process. Specifically, when asked if I would be able to present an ID and Social Security Card, I questioned if I could use a passport instead on account of my Social Security Card being misplaced. She said that I could, but the day I needed those two items she contradicted herself and said that the passport can only be used in replacement of ID, not Social Security Card.</text><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

I worked for them for a very short time, and I am so happy that they are part of my bad past. Honestly, I am very surprised that they are still in business, probably not for too much longer. The only good thing about Trans-West Security Company is their front office staff Ericka and April who are very professional with great customer and employee service. As for their HR manager, Supervisors, Schedulers, and Dispatch; they should be terminated and never allowed to work with the public again. They have no work ethics, no professionalism, no customer service, no training, and most of all no heart. Also, there was little to no communication and when there was communication it was miscommunication. Thank God for other job choices, because this is one of the worst job choices in my 30 years of working, that I would never want to repeat!</Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>I'm extremely heartbroken. I was in looking for a job for my wife and future daughter and I was told apply at TransWest by multiple people along with other jobs so I did and everything seemed amazing. The staff was nice and professional, office is clean and everything was good. I asked where I can put my availabilty on the application and she said I can put it on my interview. Later I made it to an interview and explained I have joined a Church that starts on Tuesday from 7:00PM-10PM so I can't work those hours along with Saturdays around the times of 6AM-10PM (On Saturday) and that I can work graveyard, for example from 10PM on Friday through Saturday and end at 6PM and Saturday at 10PM graceyard and she was really nice and let me know everything was good so I called the next day and she let me know my orientation is on Monday at 9:00AM and me and my wife got so excited because I have been job searching for 5 days straight and I need to plan a baby shower which will be so, so late due to money issues and 2 hours after I got the call for my orientation another job I applied for called me and asked if I can start on Monday so I let them know I was very appreciative oc the offer but that I bad recently been hired and my orientatiom was going to start Monday at 9:00PM. So to shorten things up I passed my orientation and when I did so, I was told to start at the same day I passed for a graveyard shift on Friday all the way to 8AM though I clearly let the lady that interviewed me know my worship times. I felt so sad when I got told to do so which showed they didn't listen during the interview but to make things much worse I got told by the lady who wanted me to work on Saturday to go to the front and to speak to the lady that interviewed me and she lead me to a room and lied to me saying that I told her that my availablity was open. I never said this and was very specific on the times I can work. Saturday 10PM through Saturday  6AM is very available and I let her know I can work for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, New years type of Holidays which I feel looked good for me but overall the worst part was being lied to... it hurt my feelings because I felt useless. I just want a lie detector test. Christians like me are obligated to honest, so her saying that I said otherwise about my availabilty really hurt me along with the fact I turned down a job for TransWest 😭 This isn't just my future but my families as well... by the way Jovon is really amazing. I would not ever want for the lady to ever fired or scorned harshly for this but retaught just a bit and to listen more to the interviews because if she did and didn't hire me I would have secured a job elsewhere but I may still end up being hired. I just feel at risk for my beliefs along with the fact that she lied saying I told her I was free all days of the week, which I would never do but I understand why she did because when the lady that wanted me to work on Saturday found out that I couldn't and that I explained this on my interview, she got very mad at the lady who interviewed me. Honestly I will edit this to 5 stars if everything gets resloved from this misunderstanding but as of now the message has to be out there so the staff can learn from it. It's not like the people are bad but I got lied to and lost a job for something that could have been prevented just by listening a bit more while taking interviews. I need a job for my family and this really hurts when you happily drive 30 minutes from your house while jobless thinking you found a spot to grow and take care of your wife & daughter...
EDIT: I been terminated for 'lying' though I have emphasized my love for my Church while in the orientation and the letter we had to write about ourselves before the orientation and said everything God would want me to in the orientation. I am seeking legal attournies for this. I've wasted so much money on gas and got a flat while running over a screw while driving there and I'm only getting paid one day of orientation. The disrespect...</text></record>

This security company is a joke . The only thing the security guard does is make out with her girl friend in the back parking lot. Unprofessional and disgusting she needs to be fired .<//Text>

<Text>I am a veteran with a background in safety and security and I’ve been working for this company for a few months and they never gave me a dependable schedule even when they hired me full time. I’ve even asked for a solid schedule and they said they would let me know and never got back to me. I am always where I’m supposed to be and never late. So I don’t understand why it’s so hard to give me dependable hours. The communication between dispatch and scheduling is terrible never, which is sad for a security company. Felt like I was just always filling in shifts people called out of and would catch attitude with me when they called random days I wasn’t scheduled and wanted me to be at an account within the next hour or two and I couldn’t make it. Which is extremely unfair to me. I got a better job offer from another security company that pays better and more dependable hours, so I put my two weeks in and now all of a sudden they dumped hours on me and I’m working every day of these last two weeks.. wonderful, where was the consistency when I was fully willing to be with this company..</Text>< Pictures>

Yoga House has helped keep me sane during the pandemic.  Their change in business model to support live-streaming and recorded classes has been transformative.  They have been incredibly nimble in adapting to the needs of students during challenging times.  Their response to feedback is welcome and has served to make modifications that benefit the broader Yoga House community.  Thank you for continuing to provide an incredibly valuable service to make each day just a bit easier.</review>

I am a client at yoga house now for over 13 years. I love the diversity of programs and teachers. It is very well managed and maintained.
I have since many years back problems but since I visit regularly Tracy’s and Amanda’s classes I can take much better control of my back pain issues. It allows me even to play 3 times weekly aggressive tennis. They are world class teachers!</Text>

Exceptional teachers! :) Fantastic understanding of alignment and form...wonderful communicators of physical cues. Each teacher has a unique approach and yet they cohesively create a "style" that is distinctly Yoga House. Proportional emphasis is placed upon mental/emotional/spiritual openness and presence as well as physical awareness. A big Thank You, to the awesome staff at Yoga House :)<//Text>

Yoga House has always been a warm and inviting place, with wonderful teachers. Since the pandemic started, Yoga House has done a terrific job of transitioning to virtual classes and workshops. Highly recommend Gentle classes with Jill (available most days of the week) and Beginning with Cynthia on Sundays. Rebecca and Susan Q, are also great gentle/beginner level instructors.<//Review>

Know what you're getting into so you can appreciate it for what it is - a luxury advanced hot yoga studio. All of the elements are advanced. The dark room makes it difficult to balance, it's heated, fast-paced, and most poses come with levels 1-4 for difficulty. This place is great for advancing your practice and getting a great work out in. My first class was a shock to the system, but by the end of my new member trial, I was raving to all of my friends about it.<//Review>

<Review>I love everything about Yoga House! The staff at the front desk, Jamie's efficiency as the general manager, the instructors (Jill, Rebecca, Susan, John, Cynthia, Amanda....), the studio itself, and how accommodating they have been during covid-19 restrictions, in making sure to bring our favorite instructors into our homes via virtual classes to carry us through these challenging times.

<review>I love going to the Yoga House and taking in-person classes -- it's such an oasis!  Just walking in the door, I can feel my body relax.  Since the COVID-19 quarantine, I have also taken several online classes and they have been wonderful -- you get the same quality instruction but in the comfort of your own home.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c48440bf6805:0x11e34c6627ad8c5a</Gmap_id><time>1594826281799< /time>< resp>

<Review>I’ve found the quality of teaching and the range of styles offered at Yoga House to be top-notch. I’ve been practicing yoga for 23 years and am a certified instructor myself, and am very choosy about where I practice. Thank you Yoga House for being you, and for going online during the pandemic so I can practice with you!<//Review>< name>

<Text>Jasmine Rausch is terrific.  She is perfect for a beginner like me.  The class is relaxing (in that groovy-spiritual yoga way), but also enough of a workout to break a sweat.  She doesn't just call out poses, but describes exactly where your relevant body parts should be and what you should be doing.  She watches carefully enough to correct you if you need it, but she doesn't hover over you correcting you every five minutes.  Generally, I'm not a yoga kind of guy.  My friends have been bugging me for years to go.  Well, guess what?  I really like it.

Hanna Capp is one of the most patient, calm, encouraging, and positive mentors I’ve had the blessing of learning from. She is so devoted and dedicated to her students/patients and always puts in 200% of her energy into every session. Thanks to her, I’ve gone from being almost immobile in my upper body to being able to participate in yoga and various other forms of physical activity. She taught me one of the most important lessons I will ever learn in life- to listen to my body and to give it the time and care that it needs, and that doing so should always be my priority. Thanks to Yoga House for providing such amazing service, teachers, and a space for healing and learning.< /Text>

Yoga House is wonderful! I recently moved to the Pasadena area and was looking for a yoga studio that offered prenatal yoga. While there are many studios in the area, Yoga House is the only one that offers so many of these per week (5!). They also have outstanding new student specials so you can try out different classes before making a big financial commitment. The instructors and staff are also outstanding - extremely knowledgeable and always willing to help. I love it here!< /Text>

A diversity of experiences can be had with excellent instructors at all hours of the day. We especially enjoy the Iyengar classes. Yoga House is non pretentious with hands on guidance. All ages and abilities welcome. They realize yoga is a process and journey. Grab your props and mats. Sweet staff. Many practitioners dedicated to Yoga House for years. A class act!< /text>

From the front of house staff, to the exceptional teachers, it's like coming home...in the way we all long to encounter home-coming. Warm, cozy, accepting. No judgments or pressure to be anyone or anything other than who we are or are not, in this present moment. Feeling grateful and blessed.</review>

I love the kindness of reception and the esthetic of flowers on the table as i walk in. I love the big cubbies where i can put my shoes. I love that you still have cork blocks, my favorites. I love the teachers i go to and the choice of gentle, or hard classes. I love the big rooms, i love everything, really, even the little picture of the incredible diva/yogi in the bathroom and the note underneath. i love the mix of funky and perfect, i just love you guys and the incredible gift it is that i can bicycle to yoga because you are so close to me!Thank you< /Text>

< review>
I became a dedicated yoga student, thanks to  Yoga House, in 2009 during a very difficult period of my life and as a result experienced healing, well being, and greater contentment. Because of my physical, psychological, and soul-enriching experience at Yoga House, the studio remains a sacred space for me.

In 2017, I began taking Hannah Kapp’s classes every Monday and Thursday. She is an amazing teacher committed to creating a healing experience through asana, mudra, mantra, and music. She weaves in chanting and on occasion her talented singing and harp playing. I’m grateful for the devotion and dedication apparent in her asana sequencing and for her passion for yoga philosophy and healing all on levels.

Jill is another amazing and gifted teacher. This past week I took her gentle yoga class. She greets students with enthusiasm and kindness and skillfully leads the class through revitalizing poses and stretches. I left feeling seen, respected, and renewed.

In sum, Yoga House is an awesome studio that remains an essential place for me in Pasadena. A deep and sincere thank you to the Yoga House owner, staff, and teachers for improving the quality of my heart, health, and spirit over the past decade. I’m grateful for all that you do!<//review>

The vibe of this studio is very calm, nurturing, and not too "hip to be hip" (in a good way!).  The instructors are all very qualified and great teachers / listeniners. I especially love the yoga tune up class on Saturday!< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Best teachers ever--the classes are varied so I never get in a rut.  I recently moved from M-W-F schedule to T-TH-Sat, and am just enjoying the variety.

Also, all the teachers I have enjoyed really represent the traditional yoga philosophy by including meditation, mindfulness, and constant reminders to breathe.  At other studios classes can seem to be just a set of calisthenics--physical exertion without that yogic purpose.

This place can be transformative--< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c48440bf6805:0x11e34c6627ad8c5a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a yoga studio truly for the mind and body, not just another fitness center. The knowledgeable and caring teachers touch on all aspects of yoga: breathing, meditation, asanas (ashtanga, vinyasa, iyengar, and more),  visualization and more. You can find classes for all levels: restorative, gentle, beginner, all the way to level 2 and 3. Plus some excellent workshops. You can feel the calming atmosphere as soon as you enter the lobby with beautiful flowers and tea. My favorite place for yoga!<//text>

I arrive at this special place once a month because I enjoy the good air that is exist in this place. The crew is highly cordial and professional. The service is extraordinarily efficient. Not to mention, the food you eat is great. I came more than once and I was never disappointed. The payment is fair. I highly suggest this place to to all.< /review>

<text>This can only be described as an attack on the working class. Laid fallow by a new disease, a heartless local decides a small Subway Franchises must pay for his frustration. Subway's are amongst the most affordable franchises opportunities in the US. Still it can take up 100,000 dollars to get to an open store. I try not to eat out that often, but I like the K-cup coffee and fresh cookies that Subway offers. But who knows if this small business can survive this brutal year. And they are only one of many tragedies on this street alone.</text>< pictures>

First impressions are critical and I’m taking time out of my day to thank the two young ladies that helped me this morning and for their positive demeanor. The store was open extra early which is helpful to those of us who need to pack a quick for our day and delivery is also available.

The absolute worst customer service I have ever gotten from any subway ever. As someone who worked at a Subway before, the staff here are extremely rude and do not understand for a second what the meaning of sanitation is!!  Absolutely disgusting.<//Text>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr. Pearl’s office inside Costco Lakewood for as long as I’ve known. I always look forward to getting my annual eye exam because they’re quick, accurate, helpful and accepts my insurance. Small office but well equipped with all the machines needed to conduct a comprehensive eye exam and a sink conveniently located in the lobby for hand washing too. Booking an appointment is so easy they accept new patients as long as they’re Costco members.</Review>< pictures>

The staff is professional and kind. I had a great experience and am so happy I go here for my eye appointments. They’re reasonably priced and make sure my eye sight is spot on and my contacts are fitting perfectly. 10/10 across the board</review>

<Name>Octavio<//Name><Date>1618424232271</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Dr Jemini Patel is phenomenal, she is extremely professional and explains everything in detail in regards to any eye concerns. In my case, I had very high eye pressure and she prescribed some drops and went back the next day and eye pressure went down and she dilated my eyes and took the comprehensive eye pictures. She explains everything in my case in detail. She genuinely cared about me and my eyes and it is very rare in these days. She really went above and beyond in taking care of my concerns with my eyes. Dr Pearl is great too but I would definitely with no reservations  recommend Dr Patel. Thank you Dr Patel 🙏🏽< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Pearl is a great doctor very professional with a lot of experience.
I highly recommend him.
He spends time with patients listen to them. They're constantly cleaning everything, disinfecting all equipment.
I feel very comfortable waking in the office they take one patient inside a the time.
Please do not make appointment with anyone else but with Dr. Pearl.< /review>

Very well run and clean, the doctor took time to give me recommendations based on my health conditions that might affect my eyes.  They sanitize completely between patients and maintain social distancing. So glad I went here!<//text>

We've been using Pearl Optometry inside Costco for years now, and every one of the optometrists has been friendly and professional, willing to answer any questions and giving useful advice, with no high pressure sales pitch. Our insurance pays most of the bill for each visit, but we'd come here even if we had no insurance, considering the very reasonable exam charges.</review>

<Text>Easy, inexpensive and very helpful. Great optometrist. They saw me quickly, with an appointment, they kept sanitizing after every touch. And walked me through all the steps easily. They went over my eye exam thoroughly and efficiently. I left with new prescriptions for glasses and contacts. And my doctor sent me home with a couple sets of contacts to try out after complaining about dry eyes. Can't wait to go back to Costco and check out their frames. I tried a few but I need more time lol.<//Text>< Rating>

Dr. Parekh spends enough time with patience! Very humble and kind. We have Costco near by, but we choose to go to Lakewood Costco only because overall that particular has better customer service and nice doctor!
Strongly recommended!< /review>

<text>The worst experience. I would give zero stars if I could.
First the assistant told my daughter that it was illegal for her to be driving without her glasses. RUDE! Last I read, they were an optometry center, not the police.
Then they dilated my daughters eyes with out explaining to her what the drops were for. It wasn’t till afterwards did they let her know she could not drive for 5 hours! Do they know that customers do drive themselves to their appointments???
Also, she has never needed drop before. However, it adds to their cost so I’m not surprised.
The exam was very short and limited, nothing compared to our usual optometry exams.
Lastly, we had to wait in line to ask a simple question, whether they could place new lenses in her current glasses. We were rudely ignored and long story short, received the WORST customer service by their very own manager, MARILYN. She was rude when we asked for help, gave a Costco employee attitude when he asked her if she could help us, she allowed a line of over 12 people to wait while she continued to clean classes, put them on display and clean up. No acknowledgement from her except to remind us to social distance, which at this point we could no longer do bc a line had built up from waiting a very long time. We were there for an hour and half and charged almost double than what my daughter could afford since she is on unemployment and does not have vision insurance.
MARILYN needs to reevaluate her position if she can’t step up in supporting her staff and give the best customer service by being hands on with the customers, not the glasses!
Everyone has a boss, so I will be looking into who I need to speak to about this experience.
They represent Costco even though they are separate from them. Costco provides the best customer service and a company like that should not be allowed to operate in their warehouses.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dd32f3f667e57d:0x618e73a23bb3f0c1< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My wife and I had a great experience at the Costco location a little over a year ago.  We are scheduling our annual checkup for this weekend.

We found the staff to be friendly and efficient.  We were seen by Dr. Pearl himself and he completed our exam.  We didn't expect full service at Costco, but he not only took care of the prescription testing but also the glaucoma pressure test, blood vessel imaging, and even dilated my eyes to examine the nerve due to my diabetes.

We were both surprised to find an optometrist there as we only thought they had an optical department.  I highly recommend them.</Review>< userid>

Pearl Vision inside the Costco in Lakewood Center Mall, is where I had my eye exam. I paid $59 for the exam which included photos of the eyes and a short exam with a provider. (I'm retired with no vision insurance) When exam was finished, the provider asked if I wanted to know the condition of my eyes for additional fee of $20. Photos had already been taken as part of the exam, but if I wanted the results, I needed to pay an additional $20. What? They take photos of the patient's eyes; do the exam with a provider who will only give you the results if you pay more! What a scam!</Text>

<review>I was put on hold by the receptionist, Crystal, for 10 minutes, hung up on, put on on hold for an additional 30 minutes, and hung up on again! Getting hung up on aside, I was put on hold for a total of 40 minutes just to change my appt date. That is completely unacceptable.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Went there doc was totally rude and told me I'd be blind in my right eye within the year and was very cold when she told me. Got a second opinion found out they were just giving me the wrong prescription. This was back in 2013.</Text><Name>john selby<//Name>< user_id>

Chill place to hang out, drink well made great craft 🍺, and watch the Dodger game.

Beer selection is quite extensive. Some delicious NEIPA and lagers. Service is stellar. Mike was a great bar tender that recommended great 🍺 paired with gummy bears. 👍. Took some cans to go!

Can't wait to come back again.</Review><Date>1530682639459<//Date>< Rating>

< Review>
The decision about whether to eat at Park Chalet should totally depend on what you care about in a restaurant. To me, the food is mediocre and the service is really hit or miss, which makes this a 3 star review. However, if all you want is to sit outside, drink good beer, and have a spot where families and dog are welcome, then this may be your place.<//Review>
<resp>{'time': 1598585312256, 'text': 'Thanks for the review Julianne. Our outdoor space has not been open in over 6 weeks now, but for the short 2 week stint we had various food trucks with a rotating schedule. We are a brewery that makes beer and in no way claim to offer restaurant dining.'}< /resp><Name>Julianne Wilfong</Name><Gmap_id>0x80c2945552bde3e1:0x3bf9c2f9a1ca5288</Gmap_id>< userid>

came here after work with some coworkers. chill vibe with lots of tables with games and stuff. their parking lot is small but you can easily find street parking. they have food trucks outside and i've even seen people order in pizza.< /Review>

< Text>
Good beers with a great vibe. On certain evenings, they have Geeks Who Drink trivia.  They gave some snacks for purchase, and usually a food truck stops by. All in all, a great place to stop after work for brews with your buddies.< /Text>

<review>Another reason to love Burbank! Just checked out this tucked-away craft brew pub last night; two thumbs up. Sorry no photos; will try to update this review with photos next time. Sizable selection of very thoughtfully crafted beers. I especially enjoyed the unfiltered double IPA, habanero-vanilla red and maple porter. Cool, relaxed vibe and decent parking. Will definitely be back!< /review>< Pics>

<Response>None<//Response><text>I've been here twice now, and both times the servers were fabulous. There were different servers each time and they were all equally friendly and helpful. I think all the beers are delicious, I think I've tasted them all by now. The Irish Red called railsplitter is probably my favorite. I expect to keep coming back. It's a beautiful comfortable space. And it's a great place to just hang out with friends and have a drink.</text><username>debbaworks< /username><Rating>5</Rating><Date>1520756558260</Date><GmapID>0x80c2945552bde3e1:0x3bf9c2f9a1ca5288</GmapID></record>

Great spot for IPA and dark beer lovers. Plenty of seating and AC/ventilation. Ordered a flight which included a dark beer with a habanero after taste- so good! There are a few game boards and large tables to play. They're cool with bringing outside food. Plenty of street parking for a Sunday afternoon.< /review>

I love Lincoln!! It was the first beer I had after having my second child and it's my go to choice go drink! The flavor is delicious and unmatched. I love the variety and supporting a local brewery! If you haven't tried a Lincoln yet, grab one! You won't be disappointed!< /text>

<text>It’s a brewery in a castle! If that’s not cool enough, they have some rad beer as well. Lots of good IPAs, a couple stouts, but I’d recommend the “anytime fiesta”.... literally a party in your mouth.

Projection screen, lots of tables, darts. I’ll be back!< /text><UserId.>115148088270087337769<//UserId.>< rating>

Came here on a Saturday afternoon, plenty of street parking and seating.  Great selection of beers. No food,  just snacks like chips and jerky but you can bring outside food or have it delivered.</Text>

The beer selection is great, I haven't tried a Lincoln Beer I didn't love! The Sharper IPA is one of my favorites, it's super clean and hoppy. Can't wait for the taproom to open!<//review>

Great beers and a beautiful tap room. A family run brewery that is rightfully proud of their beers. A must visit for hop heads!</Text>

<UserId.>106179831098703182379< /UserId.><text>Was our first time visiting here from FL, lost our ID. We had pictures of it and showed it to the bartender. (Who by the way took our order with food in her mouth) She waits until we’re sitting at our table with half of a beer to say “we can’t accept that form of ID” . And then has the nerve to tell us don’t come back loud enough for everyone to hear. This is the most horrible/humiliating experience I have ever had. She was a woman with short hair and glasses. I’m not sure if she was racist Or just plain rude, but that is not how you treat people.<//text>< name>

<rating>4< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) Good beer, good place to have a good time with friends or family ... Not very expensive and drunk good, yes without waking up with hangover (raw) that is what nobody wants ...

(Original)

<Text>This place is the best. The youngsters that work there are all very helpful and knowledgeable. I can ask for an obscure item and every one of them will know exactly where to find it. What size it comes in. And the price. With the rising price of wood these guys keep their prices as low as they can.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x54cb9a00aaea4947:0xe794836074babc68< /Gmap_id><Date>1621317014965< /Date><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

I just bought a house close by and they have everything I need for it. I never have a problem finding anything because the staff is always standing by to help. They matched the house paint really well. I got some good quality tools here too and when I had a problem starting my new saw (user error) they had certified technicians close by to help. I'm glad I purchased the saw here. I will definitely be back for more products in the near future.< /Review><user_id>104807514947740201853</user_id>< Rating>

The employees here are so courteous and boy do they know their store well!  When you walk in they ask if you need help right away and will direct you or personally take you to what you went in for.  Great supply for not a huge store.  This store is essential to Alturas when you don't want to have to leave town or drive all the way to Klamath Falls to go to Home Depot or something.  Recommended!</text>

<review>I arrived 7/27/20 and asked Mark (I think the 1st employee who greeted me) to direct me to door lock set. Because, I needed several set and Deadbolts. I asked Mark for advice and showed him pics of house project Doors & Security Gates. Mark asked me if I needed the lock sets all keyed the same. I immediately said yes (I didn't think that was possible). Mark also (after looking at my project pics) suggested the best lock set and Deadbolt Combination. I really appreciate Mark's attention to my project needs and his willingness to share that forethought with me. I RECOMMEND this ACE Four Seasons Supply Center to everyone. As Mark was dealing with my Lock Set (keying them all the same) another  young Man helped me with other project items. Thank-you very much for there help.<//review></record>

The employees are friendly and the store is clean and organized.
But the reason I give 3 stars because none of the employees are wearing facemask so is some of the customers, no one cares about CDC guideline no one cares about each other no one cares about there's a virus going on.< /Text>

< review>
They are a local hardware store . They greeted me at the door. They had what I wanted.  Their prices are reasonable,  they have a great selection of wood and rentable equipment. I shop there when I need something and dont want to drive 50 miles.  They are very friendly and have people who really know what they have and how to make things work.<//review>

Jim is a great resource. He is very efficient and knowledgeable.  Jim's personality lends itself to a high degree of customer service.  The bottom line is, he is a great guy, and a trustworthy professional!!!  We ran into some issues with incorrect charges and Jim immediately came up with a solution.   Refinancing an investment property is not an easy task but Jim has made it less painful.  He was upfront from the beginning and was able to provide spot-on expectations.</review>

<Text>•	We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for all the care, concern and courtesy, Scott Jablonski of Ladera Lending inc. showed us while working tirelessly to ensure that our refinance loan was approved. If it were not for Scott’s guidance, skills and knowledge, we know the loan wouldn’t have closed as quickly and smoothly. Scott’s mortgage advice, time, and efforts were amazing. We cannot thank Scott enough for his assistance. He responded immediately by phone/text or email to any of our questions. (at any time of the day or night) He was always patience and had a personal touch. We felt like we were dealing with a genuine, concerned person, not just a loan officer. Scott’s mortgage expertise and professionalism went above and beyond our expectations throughout the course of our loan. We will recommend Scott and Ladera Lending Inc.to anyone that has mortgage needs. We plan on moving forward with purchasing an investment property soon, of course we will be using him. We are sure his advice will make it a smooth transaction. Looking forward to working with Scott and Ladera Lending Inc. in the near future
•	Thank you, Scott!
•
•	Sincerely
•	Linda and Lester Wright..< /Text>< pictures>

<review>From start to finish....It was a wonderful experience.  Edgar made the whole process of refinancing our home seamless.  He is very knowledgeable, and answered any questions we had. This was the fastest refi for us.  It was done in less than 3 weeks from start to finish.

We will continue to use Edgar for any future lending.

<review>This entire process was one of the smoothest we ever went through. From the very first phone call to the last, Joe was very attentive. Everything was communicated to us very thoroughly and clearly either via email, phone call, or text. And his follow-through was outstanding! We never felt like we were in the dark in this entire transaction. That is customer service at its finest! We are very happy customers. We highly recommend him and his team!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Would like to thank Garrett for all his help in closing of our refinance on our mortgage.  It was fast and he was extremely knowledgeable about everything.  This was about the best closing we have ever had.  So fast.  Would recommend this company to everyone.  Thanks again Garrett.  Your company should be proud to have you on their staff.< /Review>

Kevin promised me this would be the easiest mortgage experience I've ever had, and he didn't lie!  This process was smooth, quick and efficient.  I so appreciated the use of online documentation tools. It could only have been improved if there were no requirement to print/sign/scan.  Even that process, however was easy.  Kevin is very professional and personable.  I highly recommend.<//Text>

<text>I was helped by Ross Varahrami for my refinance. No hesitation to recommend Ross highly with 5 stars. He clarified all my queries promptly and kept  me  updated of all the relevant next steps via email / text messages as requested. I did not have to field numerous calls in the middle of a workday , I am  highly appreciative of your team honoring my request . The process was painless and must confess with minimal stress( was not expecting that). We completed the paperwork from start to finish in 7 days!!< /text>< GmapID>

The folks at Ladera Lending are an absolute pleasure to work with.  They are very knowledgeable about their business, presented me with a few different types of loans they thought would be best for me and then educated me on the differences.  They were not only interested in getting me the best loan but were also interested in getting to know me.  It was as if I was talking with a friend.  There was no pressure whatsoever from these folks and they worked on my timeline (with great patience).  I highly recommend Ladera Lending if you're thinking about financing or refinancing.< /Text>

I recommend Harvey VanEman as a real estate financing officer if you are considering getting a real estate loan. Harvey made the real estate transaction very easy for us. Even though Harvey works at the Ladera Lending is in California, they were the best choice for home refinancing needs for me, in Jacksonville, fl. He knows current real estate laws in FL and handled the loan start to finish in 15 days. Harvey beat all other offers, got best refinancing deal here. Do not pass up the opportunity if you want to work with the best refinancing people I found, bar none, I checked several large firms out there, great personal professional services here.</Text>

<Review>I don't think I have enough words to explain how amazing our experience with Ladera Lending was. We worked with Nico, and he treated us like family. He was always available to answer any questions we had. Any hurdle we encountered, he had a plan and explained everything thoroughly. As first time home buyers, we were not familiar with the experience at all. As complicated as it can get, Nico made sure we were always in the loop and comfortable with the process. Even our lawyer and agent were enthralled with his prompt responses throughout the process. I don't know when I will buy a house again, but I feel like I will only go with Ladera in the future. The service they provided was invaluable.</Review><GmapID>0x80dcedcd12da4c61:0xa07bfe69ef0320f7< /GmapID>< user_name>

The experience here was amazing even though challenging, with all the paperwork and documents needed. Point, closing costs all discussed up front. No hiding closing cost or masking it in interest rates. It was made clear all my costs and this was very appreciated.<//review>

Chad was very professional, thorough and knowledgeable. He was prompt to answer questions and he always followed up to be sure things were moving forward and to insure there were not any more questions. The whole team at Ladera Lending was wonderful to work with. You can expect some referrals from me.<//Text>

When deciding to refinance my home to a lower rate, I decided to go with Ladera Lending, which was referred by Lending Tree.  They responded quickly and offered a great rate.  The only concern for me was that this was the first time I had done a transaction of this size without a face to face meeting with the people I would be working with, and that made me a little nervous.  Turning over all my personal and credit information including SSN and bank account numbers was unnerving.  The slightest delay in reaching the team at Ladera (led in my case by Sebastian Stalker) brought concerns that I had walked into a scam.

My worry was misplaced and that was reinforced every time I reached out to them.  Sebastian or an appropriate team member would quickly reply with the requested information and a few words to sooth my nerves.  I was also impressed by the professional companies that were employed by Ladera to complete the on site requirements for the transaction.

In the end, I got a fantastic rate, a quick and fair process, and easy to follow steps to that got me across the finish line. At the beginning Sebastian laid out a plan and time line and Ladera held to it, mark me as impressed.

I would NOT hesitate to use them again, except that my rate is so low it has nowhere to go but up.</text>

I worked with Jeff Cunningham to secure a cash out loan on my property in order to construct an apartment above my garage. He guided me through my options, explained every detail and helped me choose the best terms for my needs. The entire process took less than 30 days. Jeff also told me that he will review the interest rate of my loan in 6 months to see if I could get an even lower interest rate on my 30 year fixed rate loan. I am holding out hope that this will indeed happen. I would recommend Ladera Lending based upon my experience.<//text>

Scott has been an absolute pleasure to work with and we were able to complete our refinancing process smoothly and efficiently. I truly appreciate Scott’s professionalism, integrity, diligence, as well as his clear and open communication style. I definitely look forward to working together again.<//Review>

<review>This is my second time getting a loan with Andy Espineira from Ladera Lending.  The personal touch and open communication is one of Andy's strongest traits.  And its definitely the  most important in making me feel confident that we can make this happen.  Andy and his team works with you through every detail and helps maneuver through even the most difficult parts of the loan.  I'll forever be going back to Andy for all my real estate lending needs.  Highly recommended!!</review><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

The entire loan process was explained very clearly through email. This is a reason I have made to go with Payton Wade. Then he stays the same numbers until closing the loan. Communication was also very helpful and clear for all my questions.  This is a surely different experience from which I had previously gone through on real estate business. I will go with him if I have to do another transaction. Thank you Payton for your expertise.< /text>

When I was shopping around for the best rate on a refi, I was lucky enough to come across Jenny, who happens to have several years of experience in the industry. I found jenny to be extremely knowledgeable, very courteous, and a consummate professional. With Jenny's help, I was able to find the best rate for my refi, consolidate my high interest debts, and facilitate a quick closing on the loan. Jenny and the staff at Ladera Lending made the entire loan process very easy and convenient for me.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Ladera was great to work with.  They are very first time buyer and Veteran friendly .  As a veteran access to a VA loan is great to have but it also comes with it's own set of specific circumstances that can at times be more of a hassle than obtaining a regular loan.  My loan officer Marlon really understood the eccentricities of the VA loan approval process and guided me through it patiently, responsively and with prompt attention to all my questions and issues that came up during the application, approval , hunting and closing process.<//review>

Ross Varahrami was very kind throughout the process. He answered any and all of the questions that I had and took the time needed on the calls or texts. He was honest about what would work and the time frame that it needed to be done in. He was always positive and encouraging. Ross is a great person to work with!<//Review>

Ladera Lending is a great lender. They really stand up to their promise when they say they will close and refinance your loan in 30 days they’re really good on their words. Kris is a very nice and pleasant person to talk to and do business with- he is always there for you and answers all your questions. I really recommend them to anyone who wants to refinance-very fast and efficient company!</Text>

Jason was all business, advising us on the loan application process and the loan options.  He was VERY personable, and answered all of my questions without haste.  Our time is valuable, I so much appreciated how Jason & I could progress through this process together, sending the documents through DocuSign, and working parallel paths to close our refinancing loan. I’ve already given a colleague Jason’s contact information.  It was a pleasure working with him!</Text>

<Text>I had the pleasure of working with Joseph Chaoui with Ladera Lending in the spring of 2021 to refinance my home. My experience working with Joseph was outstanding!!! My husband and I are both self employed, so we knew that it would take extra effort to refinance our home. Joseph had my back throughout the entire process. He clearly explained every one of my questions and we were able to get an amazing rate in record speed. The entire process was so smooth and organized, which is a rarity in this industry. I can't wait to work with him again! Thank you Joseph Chaoui & Ladera Lending for your incredible service!< /Text>< username>

<Date>1615998792514<//Date><review>I applied for a refinance loan on a rental property owned by my brother any myself.  I communicated the ownership but yet Ladera issued a new deed that caused a huge property tax re-assessment $$$$.  I had to hire a lawyer to void the deed issued as part of the loan package.  I think Ladera should of invested more time discussing if a deed change was required for the loan - Quicken loans had no issue not changing the deed in a prior refinance by having my brother sign the paper work.</review>< rating>

Mike Adams and Ladera Lending were professional, responsive, resourceful and accurate in helping my wife and I refinance our existing 30 year home mortgage.
During this time of rapidly falling interest rates, and many, many unsolicited offers to "help us" refinance, only to be deluged with anything but help, Mike Adams and Ladera Lending came to our rescue.
Simply we wanted to lower our carrying cost of our existing mortgage and, if possible, cash out about $100,000 without an increase in our monthly costs.
Mike and Ladera came through, answered all of our questions with understanding and willingness to listen to our requirements (we don't do this refinance stuff often!).
Mike's professionalism and experience, along with the capable staff at Ladera, enabled us to explore a few, meaningful options and calmly decide on what was the best option for us.
All of this was accomplished in less than a month!!!
Professionalism, responsiveness and results: that is what we got from Mike and Ladera. You can too!<//Review>

<Name>Thanapong Srivieng<//Name><review>The service and personal attention I received from Jeff Yubeta was exceptional and beyond what I  was expecting! His knowledge of the local and national market and his commitment to finding us the best rate helped us search for refinancing. As the first time doing a refinancing, everything was new to us, and the most important thing I wanted was someone I could trust. Jeff was there for me every step of the way. I'm glad we chose her services and would recommend Jeff Yubeta to anyone buying a home or doing refinancing.

Ross at Ladera made refinancing so easy! He and his staff were extremely transparent through the entire process and he communicated everything in a timely and easy to understand manner. Closing was very fast thanks to the great team they have assembled and others they partner with. Just can’t say enough about the company, the people, and the process. Highly recommend contacting them if you are looking to refinance.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Working with Kris Hartmann at Ladera Lending was an amazing experience.  He took lots of extra time to explain every part of the loan process.  When we had questions, he would find the answers for us promptly and get right back to us.  I love how easy he was to reach by text or phone.  He would answer promptly.  We also appreciated his patience and the wealth of knowledge he was willing to share.  He also was able to get us a better deal that other competitors.  Great interest rate and much lower closing costs.   If I ever need to go through the loan process again, I will definitely be using Kris Hartmann.</text>< pictures>

<text>Wow! We were really impressed with the coming together of three things in our refinance - lowest rate, great service, and quick closing. We had never heard of Ladera before but were encouraged by the good ratings. Sure enough, they offered a great rate and were available to us any time we had a question. They kept us up-to-date along the way and closed faster than any refi had had before. We highly recommend.<//text><rate>5</rate></record>

Garrett Bradshaw was all about my convenience, contacting me through my preferred method, calling me on a Saturday to ease my concerns (which turned out to be unfounded.) He approached me with the best case scenario and kept his word. His assistant Danielle was helpful and stayed on top of our process to keep things moving, making sure I didn't miss anything with initial paperwork and cause my own delay.  She even helped me late on a Friday evening.  On Kim-Paris also was a great processor.  She prepared for the worst and delivered the best. Exactly 3 weeks after my initial contact with Garrett, we were fully funded and the whole refinance was complete.<//text>< pictures>

Worst mortgage company I've ever had to deal with.  It's taken them 8 months to not close a refinance loan.  We've given them everything they've asked for within a couple of days and a week later they want more.  And then the next month, they start all over again.   If they didn't want to make the loan, they should have just said so last August.   And if you're wondering, the credit score is well over 750.< /text>

<Review>Jim Henderson recently helped me with a refinance. He explained the entire process in detail and continued to provide updates. He left me with the impression that he did have my best interest in mind. He also provided his cell number in case I needed to reach him at anytime.

Also know that I shopped 3 other companies. Jim was the most professional and Ladera Lending had the best pricing.

In addition, Ladera Lending is a direct lender and not a broker. I was also able to complete most of the process using my phone, with the rest on my laptop. Application to funding was 30 days.

If you are considering a mortgage you must contact Jim at Ladera and see for yourself.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dcedcd12da4c61:0xa07bfe69ef0320f7< /GmapID></record>

These days you can shop for a home loan with minimal effect on your credit score...so that is what I did. I was fortunate enough to find Nico Sharp, Senior Lending Advisor at Ladera Lending, Inc.  Nico is a knowledgeable, kind and courteous professional who was always there to answer all of my questions and made the loan process simple for me to understand. Best of all, my loan cost me just about nothing, by way of lender credits, and the process took only 3 weeks, start to closing!</Text>

Kris and his team at Ladera Lending are second to none. When it comes to lending they are in the top 1% in my book. I’ve been a real estate broker since 1979 and have had dozens of personal loans. This one was the easiest, and quickest. Kris is knowledgeable, with great communication skills. His team walked me through the process effortlessly. Ladera Lending’s processors and underwriters work in sync for a smooth, no nonsense funding. I received loan approval in 14 days, funding in 28 days, and that was during the month of December!  Hands down, Kris is the best!< /Review>

Weeks after our loan's closing and funding, we are still dealing with problems created by Ladera. There are plenty of companies that can competently handle your finance needs. Beware of Ladera.<//text>

<review>Stephen with Ladera Lending was the first person to contact me when I filled out an on line request for refinance information.  He collected my information and always kept me informed.  He saved me several hundred dollars in my original refinance request, and suggested I refinance my primary residence.  I had not considered this, but it will save me hundreds.  Very pleasant to work with and very helpful people.< /review>< Date>

My experience working with Andy and Ladera Lending has always been positive. I am a returning customer having first refinanced with Andy a few years ago.  I have never had an easier time refinancing my home. Andy and all the staff were extremely professional, efficient, and always in communication. My refinance was completed expeditiously and to my complete satisfaction. I highly recommend them.</text>

I had never refinanced my mortgage online before, so I was pretty anxious  about the entire process. Kevin stayed in contact with me throughout the entire process and reassured me each step along the way. He was extremely easy to get responses from and was able to get me a fantastic rate. When I was nervous he stayed calm. You would think,”this is business, what’s to get nervous about?”. Giving all my info to someone I have never met in person was very difficult for me. So I was EXTREMELY pleased with the ease with which I was able to contact Kevin for questions.< /review>

<review>We had such a great experience with our refi at Ladera Lending. Marlon Escota was fantastic to work with and we are 100% satisfied. We are saving money and it will make a huge difference for us. Marlon was helpful, friendly, and informative. He got back to us quickly when we had questions. We always felt like he was on our side and that he treated us like people with a family, and not just numbers in a bank account. We appreciated that. We recommend working with Marlon Escota with 0 reservations. Thank you so much! I hope everyone has a great refi experience like ours.< /review><rating>5</rating>< date>

Best Refi experience I ever had. I did my due diligence and applied with several lenders to try and get the best deal. Then I was contacted by Jenny Hulett of Ledera Lending. She said she could close within 2 weeks, and get me a better rate than all 3 other lenders that I applied with, with cash out. I was skeptical, so I did not cancel the others, and figured I would go with whoever could close first with the best rate. Jenny came through on her claim, and we closed, and funds are deposited in my account in 13 days. The other lenders are still asking me for documents, and I told them I wanted to cancel. No brainier......Ladera Lending, and Jenny Hulett are the way to go!!! Thank you Jenny. Your the best.<//Review>

He was amazing and honest, and he explained every step and guided me along the way. I have had previous experiences with other lenders in the past, however, Ross is by far the absolute BEST!

I worked with Marlon Escota from Ladera Lending for my refi, and he provided me with absolutely best in class customer service, professionalism, loan expertise, and white glove treatment.  I had to sign the docs overseas, which adds significant complexity, and Marlon worked tirelessly after hours to ensure the process was completed properly from start to finish and loan funded on time.< /review>

I was called by Ladera Lending who received my information from lending tree. I asked them kindly not to call me. I have received 3 calls since asking within a 24 hour period. The last call was extremely disrespectful. When I asked them not to call me back, they said “that sounds like a great reason not to save money” and then hung up. I don’t appreciate your sarcastic BS and I will not be associating with you. Do not call me again.<//Text>

Fair and equitable, with disclosures. Rates and fees are comparable and in my particular application, it was exceedingly acceptable . Open to communications, open to discuss costs factors, clearly top notch training from my point of view.  If everyone is selling the very same product,,,then all you've got is service  to press forward.  It all starts from the top down. My  impressive loan professional was Cheri Whitman.
She  IS  "money back guaranteed".</review>

We were looking to refinance and I got quotes from several different companies, this was the only one who didn't inflate the costs or add additional costs throughout the process. From the beginning they were upfront about the rates and fees which is the reason we went with them. Jacob Z. was really communicative throughout the process answering all my questions promptly and was kind and patient in the process. Overall HIGHLY recommend!< /review>< pics>

<Text>I originally started the refinance process with AmeriSave because the reviews stated quick closings. I provided them with all requested documentation and after 90 days (and interest rate increases) they finally were ready to close but I would owe money to keep the original rate. I then called Ladera, spoke to Robert Mino, 16 days later we closed.  Same info provided to both companies in the same timely manner. Ladera’s process was extremely streamlined and Robert was EXCELLENT! Highly recommend!</Text><UserId.>113359920660041785223</UserId.>< username>

Marlon is excellent! Why? He took extra time walking us through the process and explaining in layman terms the reasons behind the actions. He is truly top in his career and he shared his high level knowledge with us. I will definitely work with Marlon again in the future.<//text>

We have used Ladera Lending for two refinances.  Our rep Andy Espineira is awesome. He was able to get us the best rate and his team is very responsive despite the time difference.  I have referred them as well, which is something I don't do lightly.  Thank you Ladera!< /Text>

I just closed a refi mortgage through Austin Grimsley at Ladera Lending in less than 30 days from introduction to closing.   I have done many loans in my life but none smoother than this one.  And I am not an easy applicant with only a W-2 form to verify.  I have more than 20 rental properties in two states that had to be reviewed and underwritten.  Austin assured me they could get it done and they certainly did, and at the interest rate quoted on Day 1.  If you are thinking about refinancing, I enthusiastically recommend Austin Grimsley and Ladera Lending!<//Text>

I have done 3 refinances with them and all of them have gone smoothly. I have always been explained in great details the process, the options, the numbers, etc. and without pressure coached me through the process and to help me to select the best and more profitable option. Quick processing and clean. They deliver what they promise, and they are always there when you need to contact them for any reason. They have an extraordinary team, and Jason Brewster, my loan officer, is the best in the market. Jason has become my "go to" loan officer when I need one. He also keep regular contact with me when he identify opportunities to improve my loans, provide me with options and, without any pressure at all, coach me so I can make my own decision. I will not hesitate to keep doing business with Ladera Lending and with Jason Brewster.< /text>

Ross at Ladera Lending saved us from a poorly run leading company. My wife and I owe Ross and Ladera Lending a lot! We told Ross that we wanted to refinance our home, and he honestly told us what we were able to do. Not only that, but Ross contracted us every week to update us on the status of our loan. Ross and Ladera....you are awesome!!!</review>

I was intimidated by the refinance process. Within the first few minutes of talking with Kevin Hall with Ladera Lending, I was reassured that the process was going to go smoothly. Kevin was always willing to answer any questions that I had, and he was always available.  I really appreciate the time and effort Kevin took to fully explain things to me.  I am extremely satisfied with his performance.</text>

Am an experienced home buyer who has refinanced several times in the past.  Met Paul through Lending Tree and he is an Outstanding Ambassador of what a quality refinance experience should be.   Paul, representing Ladera, qualified me for an Outstanding loan that met all my financial goals: removing PMI, lowering interest rate and payment, while cashing out tens of thousands to upgrade my home.  Most importantly was Paul's patience, transparency, and integrity. He earned my trust and my business.<//review>

I worked with James Stopani to refinance my little home.  I know our loan was much, and our house isn't worth all that much either, but James treated me like a king.  Great communication, great at staying involved and on top of the process, and he never rush me while on the phone and answered everyone of our questions as best he could, or recommended who to speak to at our previous lender if he wasn't sure of the correct answer.  (As they were more questions and decision that Well Fargo had to address.  Definitely not a knowledge gap on Jame's part.) 100% Recommended.< /review>

I'm retired and have a modest fixed income, significant retirement assets, exceptional credit and very little debt.  But given this, as mortgage rates have dropped i was turned down by 4 other lenders when i tried to refi because of income requirements. I was referred to Kevin Hall at Ladera Lending by a family member who had a great experience with him.  Kevin walked me through the process and clearly explained options for how to qualify.  He was the only one interested in helping me get approved.  As i gathered my paperwork, Kevin got me locked at an incredible rate and closed in just a few weeks.</review>

Mary was in touch and available every step of the way . She is a Excellent Dedicated Employee that knows how to make it Happen and that Trait seems to be missing in this world . My opinion at 62 and after 35 years at IBM You need to Pay Her More Money because the Service she provides your business is Key in todays Cut Throat Environment . We all need more like her . Rating Mary on a 1 to 10 Scale I give her a 20 ! In Fact when we downsize one day I will definitely be utilizing her AGAIN. Carp !</review>

<Text>We recently refinanced our mortgage through Ladera Lending.  I was impressed with the entire team and how easy it was to work with them.

I especially appreciated the assistance of Jim Henderson, our Senior Loan Officer. He was a pleasure to work with.  He was always available to answer questions and give direction throughout the process. Jim is very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous.  He helped to make the process so easy that our loan was approved in less than three weeks!
I would highly recommend Jim and Ladera Lending.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating><Name>Nicki Poor</Name>< Date>

The rocket ship’s approach had me thinking I’d called a used car lot after each script read sales tactic fell flat, the  Rocketman went straight for the credit card digits 4x in a 5 minute span.
Jason with Ladera provided me a parachute when the Rocket went up in flames. Renewed my spirits that not all these companies are just seeking that quick commish check. He walked me through my options in a courteous professional manner. He still hasn’t asked for my credit card and I closed on my refi last week.<//review><username>Chadwick D.

Jason refinanced my mortgage without any hassle and faster than anticipated. The whole experience was very smooth and pleasant. During the first phone he explained the whole process, I signed a few documents online, got visited by a notary, and in a few days got my cash out and had the mortgage refinanced. The rates and closing costs were competitive and that's why I chose them. I could tell right away that Jason was a true professional.</Text>

It all starts with the personal relationship established quickly between the mortgage lender, Devang Anand, and myself,  the borrower. Devang was personable, friendly, knowledgeable and above all, honest in all dealings from the very first day through the final day of settlement. I would recommend him to my friends and family members with no reservations whatsoever. I can assure anyone reading this survey that you will be delighted with the interactions and results by engaging Devang Anand.<//text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Joe Totah and Sarah Mitchell were my advisors through this process. Not only did they get me the lowest interest rate available at the time, they kept me informed and on track throughout the entire process. Even as Joe got sick and was unable to speak, Sarah stepped in to help out, and Joe kept in touch via e-mail and text the entire time. Start to finish, 3 weeks, including getting my home equity check delivered to the door. Great job Joe and Sarah.< /text>< rating>

Alan was great to work with! I was not sure at first with all this online process since it’s so hard to see what company’s are real & honest! BUT...
I am very happy that I answered Alan’s phone call and got my lower rate and got the refi done in less than 3 weeks. Great team to work with and very professional in every aspect!< /Review>

Jaekoo Lee of Ladera made the refinancing process a breeze.  I have have several refinances of the years so I am familiar with all of the items needed and also aware of what causes delays.  I had no problems with Ladera.  Jaekoo is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and  was timely responsive to my questions, whether by phone, text, or email. More importantly, Ladera is extremely competitive and I completed the refin process feeling great about the experience and the value I received. I just wish I had more properties to refi with Ladera.< /review>

After a 3 month nightmare trying to get a slam dunk refi on a 15yr with a competitor.. we finally gave up and switched to Ladera.  Best decision ever.  Our 15yr refi @2.25% opened and closed in under a month as promised.  Started 7/29, closed 8/26 and Funded 8/31.  It was so simple and easy and no nonsense.  We went from a 2.625% rate to 2.25% and saved thousands.  You should too..  Beyond Grateful.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
So I was already locked in a good rate with another company that I had been working with for a few months but they couldn’t offer me a good rate for a cash out refi... I’m happy they were honest with. I was looking for a heloc option when Mathew Winkle called my phone and promised me not only a better rate but also a better rate with a cash out in record time. Yes I had my doubts about how fast it could happen but I was truly optimistic about it actually happening even if it took an extra week or two because we are very qualified candidates but it is tricky because we are self employed. I explained to him in detail about all our financial potential problems and still mat Winkle continued to assure me there is no doubt that the loan won’t go through. I spent $750 for a home appraisal thinking that this is a guarantee.  Not only does it take more than one month (which was promised) for them to get my new loan it takes over 3 months. They give me an initial approval and then when it comes time to actually follow through on their promises they cave. Initially I was trying to take cash out. Then they tell me I can’t have cash out even though I have %40 equity in my house so I settled for just a normal refi... it was guaranteed multiple times,  but after me calling for weeks trying to figure out were stand they kept giving me the run around. For some reason mat Winkle and his underwriters are on completely different pages and decided that we could not qualify to reduce our mortgage by $500 a month... (rate of 2.75% locked by Ladera lending) somehow I can’t afford that by their standards but have been able to make that payment every single month for the past 6 years. My biggest takeaway from this company is that they will say anything to get a hopeful sale, even ruin one that was already set to help my family. I wish I would have stayed with my first company even though it wasn’t as great of a rate that was promised. My life would be better if I never answered mat Winkle’s call. He seems like a nice guy but literally every promise he made fell through. I had major renovations planned for our house which pushed my clients back and I wish I just didn’t answer his call. I asked for his mangers number multiple times, never received it. Please don’t fall into the trap of empty promises and no follow through. Zero stars from a client who worked with them for over 3 months. Btw Monique was cool and very nice to work with.</Review>

I had such a wonderful experience working with Kevin Hall and the team at Ladera Lending! After reaching out with some casual interest in to my refinance options, it didn’t take long before Kevin knew he could help. I was able to upload everything he needed remotely and he worked out an option to get my rate under 3% and with payment savings of over $400 a month! Kevin communicated every step of the way and made the process quick and easy. From the initial phone call to funding the loan was done in under a month. Such an awesome experience and would highly recommend!< /Text>

Over many years I have refinanced several times before, both on my existing residence, as well as on previously owned homes. Never has anyone made the refinance experience as quick and easy as Kevin Hall. More importantly, Kevin Hall delivers on what he tells you he is going to do.  Kevin kept me up to date on the process as it quickly made its way from approval to closing.  I found Kevin Hall to be very responsive and he makes himself available at anytime - not just from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. Kevin makes you feel valued and much more than just one of many loans in a pipeline. I have already referred family members to Kevin Hall and will continue to refer him to friends and family.<//Review>

We highly recommend Joe Totah for loans. Our refinancing went smoothly,  Communication with him was great ! Any time we had a question he would always answer and for some reason he didn't answer right away, he would call us right back. We even called and texted  him on weekends which really helped. I have told many friends and family about how efficient he is.<//Text>

<Review>Recently completed a refi with Ladera Lending and couldn't be more pleased with the service and great rate that Ladera was able to provide.   Bob and Iris did an outstandingly job making the refi process extremely quick and painless.  Having recently gone through a previous refi with one of the other Big Box lenders, Ladera Lending was able to  able to offer a competitive rate and the process took about  30 days less than the other guy.  Thank you Bob and Iris and the rest of the Ladera Lending team!!<//Review>< Response>

We just did a re-fi with JASON BREWSTER at Ladera Lending, Inc.
We were very pleased at how professional Jason was throughout the whole process.
Jason was very prompt at answering our calls and emails.
Jason also kept us well informed as to what was going on.
His communication was excellent and always knowledgeable.
Our re-fi was completed in a very timely manor.
I would highly recommend Jason Brewster to any family or friend.
We heard about Jason through our Son as he used Jason recently and he came very highly recommended to us.
I have since passed Jason Brewster's name on to a very good friend and told her I highly recommend him.
Many thanks Jason and staff for a job well done! I will continue to pass your name around.

Sincerely,
Janet Sperbeck<//review>

<Review>I had a very rewarding experience refinancing my home with Brandon Tran of Ladera Lending.  Through out the process, Brandon kept me informed, answered all of my questions, and served with an efficient and friendly manner.  I would highly recommend Brandon Tran and Ladera Lending for your future home loan decisions.

This is our 2nd refinance transaction with Ladera Lending and Paul Bogosian.  We were able to lock in great rates for two properties due to Paul's proactiveness, deep understanding of the market, and efficiency. Paul is trustworthy, competent, and responsive.  All of our interactions with Ladera Lending staff were equally pleasant, with clear expectations and explanations given for the entire process. As a result, everything went very smoothly! I highly recommend Paul at Ladera Lending for anyone purchasing a new home or refinancing.</review>

Proof is in the expiration of our Appraisal due to the amount of time they have taken.  Excuse after excuse to my wife about why... but never and answers.  I’ll update this if anything gets better.

We cold-called Scott Jablonski based upon a referral we received from friends.  Scott had assisted them with both a refi, and a mortgage for the purchase of a new home.  We were so glad that we did.  From the first email I sent Scott, he was responsive to every email, every voice mail, every question was answered.  He kept us informed of our options and the progress of our refi along every step.  We’ve done Regis in the past and have never really had any issues, but working with Scott was a step above.  I felt like he really cared about us getting the best loan we could.  Professional, personable, and productive.  Thanks again, Scott!< /Text>

Loan process will go smooth. They'll help a bunch when you need them and be super friendly. Honestly got a good rate and liked Andrew. Here comes the part where I lose confidence:

I found out that I overpaid $3,000 in property taxes and sent an email about it. Andrew said he would figure it out. 4 days goes by, no response. Sent a text on the 5th day and got a reply saying he was waiting on the Escrow to let him know. Fast forward a week and a half and I still have nothing. So I picked up the phone and called the Assessors Office. Figured it out within 10 minutes. The kicker is, the Escrow Company was Orange Coast Lender Services. Read their reviews. I'm expecting this to just be a mess. They've now got $3,000.00 of mine and judging by their reviews that's not a good thing.

Honestly thought I would be giving them 5 stars. I was super happy with my experience until all of this happened and the communication dropped off the map. Sometimes the last 1% of the job is more important than the first 99% of the job and they definitely dropped the ball. A couple of phone calls and/or an email would have negated all of this, I'm not a person that's hard to work with nor am I not understanding. I get things happen, it's what you do after they happen that counts.

They're not a bad company to use, just make sure you stay on top of them and don't expect much communication after the money is transferred.</text>

<Review>My lending agent was Brandon Tran and let me just say, from start to finish, this guy is a stand up dude! First of all, he's very open and thorough with the break down, options, and numbers with what it would take with the refinance plans we were considering. The moment we were ready to pull the trigger, we got everything done and closed escrow within a couple weeks (maybe even less)! He does a great job of following up with you on every detail and change and it just feels like a very friendly vibe with not pressure or rush. If you consider going with Ladera Lending, please please PLEASE ask for my guy Brandon Tran to service your loan!</Review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>My husband and I were trying to take advantage of the low COVID rates so we went with the first lender we talked to (Quicken Loans) and they told us it would be about 30 days to close. Well after about 70 days we still hadn't closed and they were still requesting proof of my husband's self employment income. Needless to say we were ticked. Before pulling the plug I started looking into other lenders to see if anyone could match their offer (closing costs, interest rate, and payment). Well I came to Ladera Lending and they were able to beat the rate, closing costs, and qualify me with only my income to avoid the self employment hoops. Their customer service was fantastic and we will be using them next time we need help with a mortgage!</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcedcd12da4c61:0xa07bfe69ef0320f7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Cheng and I had talked about a refinance on my mortgage; however, we were unable to qualify.  About a month later, Cheng followed up with me to let me know some changes had occurred and that a VA loan was possible.  I really appreciated Cheng's initiative and thoughtfulness to continue researching my situation and finding the right refinancing for me and my husband.  These days, it's always best to try to stretch limited resources as far as possible, and Cheng certainly did that.< /text>

<text>It would be helpful if Kevin Tran didn't lie through the application process. He claimed if I didn't get something done by Friday in August 2020 that they would have to add a 1 percent fee onto the loan. He even had the gall to send me an outdated link to an article that no longer applied. I highly recommend not using this lender or Kevin to do your mortgage. He's not trustworthy.</text><Response>None< /Response><rating>1</rating>< user_id>

<review>After wasting 3 months trying to close a ReFi with Loansnap, I was looking for another lender to save me.  Fortunately, Nick from Ladera Lending reached out to me and was able to gain my trust by explaining all my options and giving me a realistic timeline of what he could do for me.  Nick stayed involved in every step and kept me updated constantly.  Ladera was able to close my refi in approx 3 weeks -- Got a 2.25% 30 year fixed with some points.  Very happy with Ladera Lending's execution.<//review><username>Forrest Graef< /username><user>106599356648762314738< /user><rating>5</rating>< time>

Wanted to say how happy we were to have Jeff Cunningham as our loan officer. He was extremely easy to work with, was very honest despite how long these things can take and kept us updated on the progress. The loan actually moved through fairly quickly, got a great rate and got all our needs met.  Thanks Jeff!< /Text>

Chaoui rep helps me from a bad Refi lender which was dishonest and rude toward me at the end when I discovered that (Tom Brown lending) cheated me more than $2000 dollars add-on to my refi paper. Chaoui helped me and get it thru in an amazing fast and much much cheaper. I can't thanks him enough for what he did for me on my refi. I got exactly what I want it. Highly recommended this lender to anyone who want honest and straight forward with refinancing.

<review>Brian Brown was amazing. He always answered my calls no matter what time I called. I think he must work all day every day. Every time I called he made me feel like I was his only client and my needs were the only thing that mattered. He got us a great rate on our mortgage and really went above and beyond making this a stress free transaction so I could enjoy the excitement of the home buying experience. It really said a lot when the escrow company that he had never worked with said “I don’t know where you found this guy but he’s amazing, we’ve never seen anything like him.” I would definitely recommend him and would definitely use him again. Really can’t say enough good things about him.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I had started the refinance process with my [now] previous mortgage company and I was not pleased with the rate 3.375%, but continued with them thinking it would be simple. After a month and a half and a few mistakes on their end, a friend said to call Josh Stewart with Ladera Lending. I called Josh on July 22 and I signed my final loan documents on August 7. I got a 30 year loan at 2.875%. Josh made the process much simpler than my previous mortgage company, and they already had all my information on file. If you are looking to refinance because of the low rates, I recommend you contact Josh to see what he can do.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcedcd12da4c61:0xa07bfe69ef0320f7<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Ladera Lending, Inc. proved to be an outstanding organization. From my first contact with Jason Brewster through my final contact with On Kim-Paris, they we professional, timely, and highly responsive. The last time I had refinanced was about 10 years ago. They brought me up to date on today’s approvals and requirements with an overwhelming amount of patience.  I’m a scientist so financial stuff tends to be very difficult for me. However, Jason made things clear and concise allowing me to make quick, easy, and well-informed decisions.

I would, and already have, recommended Jason and Ladera Lending to a friend looking to get in on these lower lending rates with a minimum of work on our side with Ladera Lending providing the expertise.

On Kim-Paris and Jennifer Anderson jumped in and helped clarify a couple of questions I had when we were processing some technical details and understanding the next steps of the process. They, along with Jason, did a wonderful job keeping us on-track with funding and closing happening on schedule with no hiccups.

My interactions with Jason Brewster were nothing short of a set of excellent experiences.

I’d like to say a heartfelt Thank You to the whole Ladera Lending team.<//review>

Ladera Lending and especially Sean made refinancing my home loan a fast, easy, and painless process, Sean Matthews was my loan officer, and he was the best! He is professional, Knowledgeable, personable, available to answer all questions, extremely competent, and honest. He worked hard to get me the absolute best loan possible! If you are looking to refinance or obtain a new home loan, I highly recommend Ladera Lending, and ask for Sean, he will take excellent care of you throughout the whole loan process</Review>

I had the privilege to work with Ismael Hernandez.  I couldn't be more happier & satisfied with the work he did for me to refinance my house.  Mr. Hernandez went above & beyond his duties to help me & kept me informed of every step throughout the process. Many times, I felt quitting,  but he kept me going. His team, including Sunny Kelly, is fantastic.  You'll get answers to all of your questions & give you the best advice. If I could give him more than 5 stars, I would.
I highly recommend him & his team if in need of refinance. You won't be disappointed.  I can't say enough good things about him & his team. Thank you Ismael & thank you Kelly</Text>

<review>We just refinanced our house with Ladera Lending.  They gave us a great rate and closed when they said they would. We shopped around with a total of 5 mortgage companies.  We are so happy with our experience refinancing with Ladera Lending.  We highly recommend them to anyone wanting to reduce their interest rate and get great service.  Love that they even sent a mobile closing agent to us so we could sign from the safety of our home!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

I’ve used Brian Brown on several refinances. The reason I always go back to him is because after the refinance, I’ve never had second thoughts about if I got the best rate. I always have felt well taken care off. He responds promptly to my questions and explains the process completely. I have absolutely no problem recommending Brian to my friends and family.< /Text>

We wasted three months working with the company that previously held our mortgage before I was contacted by Ladera Lending and everything changed.  Patrick Creavy was made aware of the challenges we had faced with the prior company and he promised, "Greg, we will get this done - it's our job and we do it well."  And "well" they did.  We were kept in the loop throughout the entire process.  Patrick was a dream to work with.  He is a man of his word.  Ask for him. You won't be disappointed.<//text>

<review>Byrom is just incredibly attentive, available, honest and respectful with his clients.
We experienced a few hiccups during the process and if it had not been that Byrom was in our corner we would have probably canceled the process. We will certainly recommend him to family and friends.

< Review>
I had the good fortune to work with Nate at Ladera Lending as I was considering refinancing my home mortgage. Nate was very knowledgeable and worked me through the process with ease. He provided all the available options as he listened to my needs and eventually the one that worked best for me. He also provided the means for giving the necessary documents easy. The whole process was relatively smooth and fast. Thank you Nate for your pleasant professional service!< /Review>

<Date>1595084087798<//Date><review>I just closed a refinance transaction with Mark Pascual and the team at Ladera Lending. During the process Mark was on top of everything and was very helpful with providing me the necessary information to make the right decision for my specific refinance needs. He and the team were always accessible to answer my questions and concerns. Considering the difficult times we live in, I was surprised how organized the process was from the beginning to the end. And of course the transaction wouldn't have completed if it was not for the competitive rates and closing costs that Ladera was able to offer. Thank you all!</review><UserId.>107281183874853948623<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

How are people recommending this place??  Just try to call their main number.  No one picks up.  Your option is to put in an extension or hit 0.  Hit 0 and get a message that no one is there.  And this is the middle of the day.

I have a loan officer that reached out to me that I've sent taxes and other info to.  He's since ghosted.  I've tried to call, text, email, etc (which was the only reason I looked up the main office #).

Huge thumbs down.  This company sucks.</review>

Ross was "Exceptional" in the handling of my refinance for my home!! I was not a believer when going online searching for rates, but Ross reassured me this would be flawless and easy as he walked this process along with me. His team at Ladera was incredible and patient, I also want to recognize his assistant Michelle who is dear and knowledgeable in getting things done or send reminders!! Thank you once again, and you will be recognized 10xs more with my family and friends!!< /Review>

We worked with Lee Kotler and honestly cannot say enough positive things about him.  Since he's helped thousands of people, he understands the information people need.  In all my conversations with him, he never seemed to be in a rush to hang up.  In the end, the finance was on schedule and I feel I made a friend.  I recommend him highly.</text>

If I could rate lower I would WORST loan officer ever. My loan officer was AUSTIN GRIMSLEY. Every time I got docs to sign the amount was different with no call or explanation from Austin. I had to make all the calls to him to find out what was going on. First almost $600.00 higher he said he didn't get to docs on Friday and by Monday lender credit changed. He increased my loan by $500.00 without telling me. Then notary comes for me to sign and the little bit of refund I was getting is gone. She stated this is not the only time she has had doc changes with this loan officer, this is her second or third time. When I try to call him he doesn't answer so I email him.  His response is " I'm having breakfast with my family" well I'm signing docs that don't match what I signed on Monday! He rattles off its per diem and you have to pay it.  Turns out it is not per diem it is the fact that they added a charge for my home insurance that WAS NOT on the first set of docs. He doesn't even take the time to check it out just spits out answers. They also got my taxes wrong they DOUBLED the amount I pay each year. Lucky for me I am not escrowed. If you get a loan from them DON'T use Austin< /review>

The process was fairly painless from the start.  Jeff Cunningham was instantly easy to work with and very knowledgeable. The communication from underwriting to him was not handled efficiently causing a delay in completing the transaction but whenever I asked him something he responded quickly and always put my concerns to rest.  I look forward to working with Jeff in the future.< /text>

<Text>Josh is an amazing professional to work with. When we first started working with Josh, refinancing our first home, I was clueless and scared. He was very patient and understanding and walked us through each step. When I was worried and seeking other opinions and options he wasn’t pushy, just helpful in educating us each step of the way. We have since been using him for many refinances and buying another home. I have recommended him time and time again and will continue to do so. An amazing person and professional. Thank you Josh and Ladera lending for your continued work ethic and professionalism!!</Text>< userid>

<text>I came across Ladera Lending and was connected to Jim Henderson. As this was my first refi, I naturally had a lot of questions. Jim was very patient and thorough in explaining and answering all of my questions and made himself available to accommodate my schedule. Throughout the entire process, Jim was very transparent and allowed for a clear understanding of the refi landscape. The process was smooth and painless and I would recommend Jim to anyone in my network looking to refi. Thanks again!<//text>< user>

<Review>Working with Sebastian and Ladera has been one of the best experiences with a lending company over the last 6 months we've tried to refinance on our home with countless other companies. Ladera not only came through for us, but Sebastian was also very pleasant and helpful throughout the whole application and process.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcedcd12da4c61:0xa07bfe69ef0320f7<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Working with Ladera and Joe was an exceptional experience. They were very professional and advised me on several key components of the financing process. My loan got funded in less than 20 days. Definitely a 5 Star experience. I would recommend the Ladera team for any mortgage needs.<//Text>

Nick and the others who assisted  and advised us on our refinance were very helpful and professional. Nick routinely kept us informed on the progress of our refinance, and was very personable, making the process relatively easy as well as very comfortable. I would not hesitate to recommend Nick and Ladera Lending to anyone looking for a company to help with any mortgage or other financial needs one may have.</review>

Ben went above and beyond to help us close during the COVID19 situation. His tireless efforts ensured that our family didn't go without a home. We are so thankful for him never giving up on our loan. Ben is kind, professional, patient and supportive. We are thankful we had the opportunity to work with him.< /Review>

<text>Rob Mino was fantastic in helping us with our refi! I've already referred friends and family to work with him and Ladera Lending. Rob was extremely responsive, knowledgeable and thorough in addressing all our questions and concerns. I was particularly impressed by the speed and efficiency of the entire refi process. Rob and Evelyn proactively kept me updated every step of the way, and was happily amazed when they were able compete our refi in under 30 days! FIVE STARS for Rob and the Ladera team.</text>< date>

<review>I can only say great things about my experience with Brandon of Ladera Lending. I've refinanced several times in  the past and this was by far the easiest experience I've ever had. Brandon walked me through every step. He always called me after sending any documents to make sure I understood everything. If all of Ladera Lending's loan officers are as good as he is, it is a great company.< /review>< name>

Doing refi with ladera lending was the best decision I had done. The process goes fast and smooth as it can be, we got the rate that we want and the process was fast, we were able to close in less than a months time. Thanks to Robert Mellody  who was very active in answering all our questions anytime and explaining every aspect of the process.<//text>

Harvey is a wonderful Loan Officer to work with. He
kept us fully in touch with every step of our
refinance process with personal phone call and
emails. His concern for our ability to understand all
the steps we need to take and the step we needed to
be involved with and with explaining area we my not
have fully understood. I would not want to work with
anyone else.

If you are looking at refinancing or purchasing, contact Ladera Lending, ask for Harvey, you will be satisfied with the quality of service you receive.< /review>

This was our fourth refinance with Scott who has helped us when we needed it the most.  He is extremely professional, and truly seeks the best rates possible for his clients.  We appreciate him so much and are truly grateful that he was able to help us refinance once again!<//review>

Very satisfied with Coby Brainard and colleagues at Ladera Lending's expeditious and professional management of the refinancing of our mortgage. It must be exceptionally difficult given lock-downs and illnesses. My main complaint is the expense which seemed excessive and unwarranted, but that is a complaint directed at management not Coby et al.< /review>

After 17 years of being a homeowner and having multiple refi's, this was hands down the BEST and easiest transaction I hv experienced. The information is Fully disclosed, clearly communicated,  no BS. In contrast w/ the past processes', now I know! Never, will I go elsewhere. Many thanks Jim.</Review>

My LO Brandon Tran knows is craft, he is super professional, listens to you, gets to know you and makes you feel at home with a close friend, kept me informed every step of the way, called or emailed me to confirm receipt of documents I uploaded to the portal.
I'm a mortgage professional who works side by side with LOs and let me tell ya.. 28 days app to fund in this super busy, low rates madness is OUTSTANDING! Thank you so much Brandon and Ladera team!<//review>< Pics>

<review>I can not say enough about Andrew Kincade from Ladera Lending.
We did a refinance and from first phone call to funding was 3 weeks.
He either called or emailed me on a daily basis to keep me updated.
All paper work was done on the computer. Then he send a notary Kathryn Veenhuizen who was also fabulous for the signing of documents.</review>< gmapID>

<text>Amidst this COVID 19 viral thing their still doing their jobs and while lending is ever evolving through uncertainty. No one knows who to trust. I found I could trust these guys. I was going to say this is too new to rate but you know me if something changes I'll post an edit. Just to keep you informed. When we deal with multiple real life issues we need a smooth deal.</text><rating>5< /rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< Time>

Hi recently completed a home refi through Ladera and the whole process was smooth and easy. Mostly due to the professional representatives at this company. Rick Higginbotham was our rep and he was very helpful with any questions we had along the way. You can bet that if rates drop below zero, I will be on the phone again with Ladera!

Excellent customer service and created an environment that I felt comfortable with in a time where trust in any endeavor, especially refinancing ones home, is suspect. I never would have thought I would have exposed my finances to a non local firm and entirely over the internet, but Ladera earned my trust.
Thank you again Joseph,

<text>Great service I managed to refinance my mortgage with Andy in less than a month. Uploaded scans on their server, all DocuSign, they arranged for everything and it ran super smoothly.  They were very clear what they needed and what was still missing, no hassle, all super professional. Would do it again (although probably won’t need to, I don’t suppose rates will drop yet again ;)</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Be prepared to be abandoned after some untruthful promises.
On August 17th, 2020, I applied to Ladera Lending, Inc. for a refinance of my mortgage, via Lending Tree. I was assigned LOAN OFFICER Sean Matthews. Upon “approval” (which should have been impossible prior to satisfactory appraisal) my loan was assigned ID #.

Mr. Mathews inflated the requested loan amount and property value. I assumed he knew what he was doing. He always sounded supremely confident in a perfect outcome.

When the appraisal came in as catastrophically low, I asked for Mr. Mathews help, sending him an appraisal from my last refinance in 2014 explaining that such low appreciation ($5K) is very unlikely due to not only the passage of 6 years, but also such improvements as a new roof and two newly remodeled bathrooms. Mr. Mathews replied that he may have “some options for me, and will I be available by phone today?”. I responded that I was available but would appreciate having “the options” in writing. The options in writing never materialized. Instead, I received an email in which Mr. Mathews (now I understand: UNTRUTHFULLY) promised that he was “putting together a rebuttal” to the erroneous appraisal “right now”. He also stated he felt: “we have a fair chance of getting a revised appraisal”. After that all responses from Ladera CEASED. No more of my messages we answered by Mr. Mathews or Evelyn Dimapilis (Processor, assigned to my application). Ms. Dimapilis must also have been instructed to not acknowledge me any longer?

When my rate-lock was allowed to expire without any response from Ladera, I sent one last email requesting that if Mr. Mathews & Ms. Dimapilis no longer could/wanted to do business, Ladera should please, AT LEAST, WITHDRAW THE CREDIT INQUIRY(S), AND TAKE STEPS TO SAFEGUARD MY PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION. This final request was also ignored.< /review>< rating>

<review>Ladera Lending was a great company to work with.  They were in constant communication throughout the process, and my loan officer was patient and explained all of the steps with us.

I would definitely recommend them for refinancing a home.< /review>< pictures>

We had an exceptional experience working with Sebastian and Ladera Lending. Our home refinance went extremely smoothly and quickly; we also got a fabulous rate! I would definitely recommend Ladera Lending (and Sebastian) for refinancing.</Text>

<text>Very fast and easy process. Payton Wade was extremely professional and knowledgeable right from very first phone call; his advice was imperative to us making best decision for our re-finance. What a relief to have this handled so well, so quickly. Nikko also very helpful in assisting with all documents and processing. We had been shopping mortgage loan/rates for about a month before hand and BY FAR LADERA LENDING & Payton Wade were the best option. Just could not give a higher recommendation.< /text>< Name>

Due to frustration with my current Lender in trying to Re-fi, I was referred to Andy, Ladera Lending, Inc.  It was the easiest, smoothest process and Andy and his team were very informative, responsive and timely.  I would recommend Andy and Ladera Lending, Inc. to everyone.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Joe Totah was absolutely amazing to work with. He made me feel 100% comfortable with the process. Communication was on point and everything worked out just as he said it would. When I had any slight hiccups he was on it resolving it. Would 100% reccomend!!!! Thank you!</Review>

Marcus was great in the begining, but once we agreed to move forward and submitted our documents, timelines were consistently missed. We were constantly reassured that things were moving along and being taken care of, but almost every time I called or emailed Marcus something else had came up that was going to further delay closing. Once closing day came, the loan and terms and numbers guaranteed in our closing disclosures to us changed with NO notification by Marcus or his team. I'm lucky I had a copy of our initial closing disclosure with me at signing to see what they had slipped in. Very unprofessional and untrustworthy and I would not recommend this company to anyone.< /text>

Ladera lending was very repsonsive. The representative Chad contacted me right away.  Chad and his team consistently communicated in a timelly manner.  They returned all phone calls quickly.  I am telling all my friends that are looking to refinance to give them a call.<//review>

Mary with Ladera was amazing.  She helped get my refi done in 15 days and kept me informed every step of the way.  Not only was she professional but she took time to hear my story. I highly recommend doing business with Ladera's competitive interest rates and superb service. Thanks again Mary!</text>

<text>Ladera offered me a loan that was superior to that offered by other loan providers and brolwers I conracted. Underwiritng and processing my ,loan was more complicated and time consuming because I was self employed, but Dave my broker was very dedicated to make it happen, and there were others who went above and beyond.< /text>< Pics>

Sunny was highly responsive, quick, and solution-oriented. Sunny and Hali were available at every step, even finding a solution while the lenders were changing their criteria due to COVID-19. My hair was standing out of concern but their quick action for opportunities made possible the closing of escrow. Awesome!< /Text>

Ladera Lending help me refinanced my house with the lower rate than my own bank offered me. They explained everything clearly; had everything in writings; delivered as promised.
I’m glad I found Ladera Lending & would strongly recommend everyone to use their service< /Review>

< Review>
Our Refi with Ladera Lending and Harvey VanEman went extraordinarily smooth. Harvey was on top of it from the get go. He kept us informed of required documents and when they were needed; validated them promptly. Harvey was just terrific and I would recommend anyone looking to finance a mortgage or refinance an existing mortgage to contact him.</Review>

I have worked with Mr. Stuart twice and I have high praise for this very kind individual. He is the type of person that I want to walk with, through all my questions about loans and rates. He is a trusted person, both professionally and personally.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Jim Sample< /user_name><text>We were shopping for a refinance program that would allow us cash out at the best rate currently possible with the lowest possible costs, just like anyone else would.  I spoke with several different lenders, heard a myriad of pitches, but found Devang’s presentation to be succinct, clear as well as educational regarding what the process is when wanting cash out and how that loan differs from just a plain refinancing.  Devang was quite responsive to all of our questions and easy to work with. I can recommend Devang all day long to anyone who is considering a refinance or an original mortgage.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>My wife & I wanted to refinance & get some cash for home improvements. I decided to get comparison quotes from 3 companies. Landera Lending was the only company that was consistent throughout the whole process. Initially the other 2 companies (I will not name them) had very attractive offers, but these were not real. Jim Henderson was my point of contact for Landera and he treated me with the utmost respect. I called him constantly and he remained professional every time. The entire process went smoothly and our loan closed last week. Thank you Jim & Landera Lending.</review>< pics>

Great and easy company to work with!  Gene Davis did a great job for me.
Giving me great advice and helping me through the refi process.
His patience and persistence made things super easy and manageable.
If you are doing any sort of refi or new home purchase I would recommend using Ladera.< /text>

Brian lead me through the loan process and made the whole thing a breeze amid a very complicated and difficult time. He worked tirelessly through the pandemic to help me acquire my first home. I was impressed by professionalism and determination throughout whole loan process. I couldn't ask for a better lender< /review>

<Review>Ladera Lending is fabulous. Senior Loan Officer Chad Gadenberger found us a mortgage that worked with our unique situation, I'm self employed. He saved us $1k / month!
They kept me in the loop in every step of the process and took a lot of time explaining several aspects multiple times. They treated me with respect at every turn.

Chad, thank you and your entire team for such an easy refi.<//Review>< rating>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Terrible. I gave all my information to Kevin of Ladera Lending. Excellent credit, many assets, great paying history, and because 1 car loan that my wife just cosigned for my daughter not 12 months old they are telling me go seek another lender. They ran my credit even though I had given them my credit scores. Now I'm stuck having to look to another lender which is gonna run my credit again. Very unprofessional.<//Text>< pics>

Much easier to deal with than Quicken and Amerisave. Closing took less than a month start to finish. Quicken and Amerisave are over 2 months.</Review>

<text>I started a loan with Ladera, and Jeff (+10 stars) and Myron(+5)were fast, lightening fast, ready to close with a straight 1st mortgage refi in less than a month. Then a lender I had called first returned my call, wooed me back with a cash out refi (I had 2 mortgages) and I switched. It was a really bad move on my part because they ultimately kept dragging their feet so I bailed out of the 2nd lender and called Jeff Yubeta at Ladera back, and asked if we could start again with the cash out refi, and he got me an EVEN BETTER rate, and everything was happy and joyful. I had everything all ready to upload from the first loan and the 2nd lender.  Then came the loan processor, Mayra, on the second go-round.  Mayra is -10 stars, so Ladera as a whole gets the full 5 star rating. I couldnt even talk to her she made me so mad She never replied to email, she let things slide for days and weeks. Jeff was the go between. Ladera was overall very fast and easy to work with, but there is this one bad apple floating around in there. I know I was a PIA client, but Ladera took care of me. You'll be happy to work with them.</text>< Pictures>

I had never heard from Ladera Lending until I set up a Lending Tree account.  I am so glad that when Paul contacted me everything just clicked.  He stayed on the phone with me during the initial paperwork/account setup.  He answered all of my questions and the whole process was expeditiously.  I did a refinance with cash out, I will not use any other company.  I am a veteran as well and used my VA benefits for my refi, with keeping my original interest rate which was important to me.</text>

<review>We are second time clients with Ladera Lending, Inc.   Coby Brainard was our loan officer.  Coby's level of knowledge and expertise makes for a great experience.  Coby is proactive and facilitates a very seamless process.  Everything is online and processed through an efficient online platform.  We highly recommend Coby and Ladera Lending both for competitive  rates and  excellent service.< /review></record>

<Text>My wife and I are very pleased with all aspects of the skilled, professional service we got from Ladera Lending — and especially with the very beneficial outcome of our refinance. The best approach was planned by Andy Espineira from the beginning of the process. Everyone involved was easy to access on the phone, or through email, and they knew all the answers. Thank you, Andy, Nikko, Darlene, and Blake.<//Text>< pictures>

Our broker, Scott J. and Ladera Lending team listened well and understood our needs and requirements for the refinancing of our home, garnered a perfect loan for what we were looking for, and pushed the process through quite seamlessly from info gathering, to preparing docs to finalizing the loan. Highly recommend them.< /Text>

What a great experience we had with Ladera Lending, Kevin and all his helpers!!!
Kevin H. was an amazing help through the whole process. Explained what was going to happen, when it would happen and stuck to those dates/ time frames.
Kevin answered all our questions and calls in a timely manner - which is hard to find in a lending company, I know based on my last expreience.
I would highly recommend Kevin and Ladera Lending. If we need any lending in the future they will be the first ones I call!!!

Our experience with Ladera lending was truly the wright one for us. Due to Joe Totahs knowledge and integrity, it was crystal clear,  how we should proceed. We were going to choose another lending company, but in reviewing our options we Joe,  it was no contest . Thank you so much joe and Ladera.<//Review>

<text>John Doung is a very nice young man who treats me more like family than a client. This is my 2nd refinance with John and the Ladora Team. I could not ask for a better experience. I definitely recommend John and the folks at Ladora.<//text></record></dataset><record>

They quoted me the best deal available of the first time I spoke to them. Other lenders tried to give me a deal that would make them more money up front and then when I didn't call them back called back with a deal that was better but still wasn't as good as what ladera had offered me the first time< /text>

Ben brewer was amazing if you are dealing with ladera for a loan Ben is definitely the guy to ask for. Out of the 6-8 lenders making there pitch I chose ladera solely because of Ben.  He was always available to answer any question I had.  Was extremely informative on every step of the process I am amazed how he made this process stress free   I am so happy I chose to go with Ben and ladera  thank you Ben. Tony. Freehold night</text>

<response>None< /response><Text>I was going to refinance my house with USAA at 4%. Then I was getting to many roadblocks till I got tired. I verified with lending tree and received a call from Jeff Wade. Not only did he make the process way smoother he got me qualified at 3.5%  Which I was surprised as I have my mortgage, car loan, insurance and credit cards with USAA. I never wrigh reviews but amazing work has to be recognized. But if your thinking of refinancing and are in these states California, Florida, New Jersey, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Washington and Oregon. I highly recommend to give Ladera Lending a call and talk to Jeff you will not regret it.</Text>< date>

It was such a pleasure working with Brock Amos on my Buyer’s latest purchase. He was diligent and delivered on everything he promised. Once he received all the documentation needed from my clients he was able to work efficiently enough that we were able to close our escrow a little early! He could always be reached by email or phone and responded quickly. Brock always gave us the truth and what to expect. I will definitely recommend him to my future clients and I know my clients were more than satisfied! Highly recommended!<//Text>

A few years back, Ladera Lending took great care of my family and I as they originated a cash out refi.

This year, with a different broker in charge of our application, I have had a horrific and slow experience.

Our broker never answers his phone.  Our processor couldn’t write a grammatically correct sentence to save his career.  These are folks who should be excellent communicators, and organized.

We seem to end up forgotten or at the bottom of every queue and the cycle times for basic back-and-forth paperwork procedures is now measured in weeks.

We’re 99 days into our application and while we may yet manage to get financed, I wouldn’t wish this process or this company on my worst enemy.<//Text>

My experience of the process which at times I felt was overwhelming was so much better with the support of Sunny Kelly.  She was with me thruout even when her part of the financing was done. She checked in with me frequently and would always respond to my questions even if it was not part of her process. She would guide me or tell me should would find out and get back to me .</Text>

< review>
I have refinanced several homes over the years, perhaps 5 times, and this was the best of them all, all led by Garrett Bradshaw. It amazed me how knowledgeable, professional, and coherent he was to me throughout the entire process and even though I had credit scores in the 500s, he helped the loan close in less than 2 weeks!!!!

Garrett had me comfortable and confident that I had made the right choice to go with him. He spelled everything out, and was always there for me if ever I had a question during the process. I was always able to get the answers. I am not one to go around recommending businesses or people to anyone, but I will whole heartedly recommend Garrett to anyone looking for an awesome refinance experience. Beats the pants off of dealing with a bank. Thank you Garrett and wishing you the very best!<//review>

My wife and I dealt with Edmund Benson for our loan and, although the process took a while, it wasn't his fault at all. First, we hemmed and hawed a bit over whether we actually wanted the thing at all. Once we were sure we did, we qualified to pull out $75k and the wheels were rolling. Through some stroke of good luck, by the time that process was over we qualified to pull $100k out of the house for a much better interest rate and so we jumped on that—which meant the blamed thing had to basically start all over again and make its way to the underwriters. Edmund was with us every step of the way, oftentimes calling or answering his phone late at night when we had concerns or questions. He was never unavailable.

Granted, this is our first-ever loan but I'm telling you, if you are considering one, you could do much worse than Edmund helping you along the tedious and often troublesome path. I'm just so thankful it all worked out! We got a reasonable monthly payment and a really nice percentage rate on this bad boy and we really do have Edmund to thank for all of it.

Cheers, good sir, you made our lives much easier throughout the entire process.  :)<//Review>

Andy did a great job. I had a bit of a tougher mortgage because I was over the $417,000 threshold and my house is technically a condo because of the way they divided the lots. Despite all this he came in much cheaper than everyone else and 50bps below where Wells Fargo currently had my loan. The process was very smooth and he kept me updated along the way. I was surprised by how fast we got everything done and funded<//text>

<text>I did an inquiry online. I received a call from Edmund Benson with Ladera Lending. From our initial conversation I was pleased with his professionalism.  Edmund took time to reassure me on my knowledge and understanding of my refinance process. Regardless of day or time, he responded to all of my texts and/or emails. Thank you Edmund for the relief you gave my family.< /text>< Pictures>

Ladera Lending is great!  I really enjoyed the personal service that Larry and his office staff made me feel through the refinance process of our home.  Larry was always calling to make sure I was kept updated of where we were in the process.  I would definitely recommend Ladera Lending to any friends and family.  If you are looking to refinance your mortgage, look no further.  Ladera is the company for you!  Thanks again Larry!<//Text>

< Review>
Loan Officer, Edmund Benson, was so easy to deal with. I had dealt with two other lenders prior to working with Edmund, and they both told me I had to have a co-buyer, but my sister referred me to Edmund when I told her that I needed to get a loan by myself (without a co-borrower) and when I told Edmund I needed to buy a house on my own he was confident after asking me a few questions that we could make it happen. Edmund was savvy in knowing what and how I would qualify for a loan by myself. I never worried with him doing my loan. He was so confident about what was needed to get my loan funded. Edmund was also fun to work with because he has a great personality. If anyone needs a referral for a lender, I will definitely recommend Edmund at Ladera Lending.</Review>

We just refinanced with Brock Amos. We were extremely satisfied with his service. He is knowledgeable, responsive and on top of things. He kept us informed at every step of the process. He made the process seamless. We recommend Brock if you contemplate of any financing or refinancing of your mortgage.</Text>

<text>I needed a home loan to pay of high interest rate credit cards! My credit score was dropping, payments were increasing, didn't know what to do. So I called Ladera Lending, and worked with Garrett  and in the end, when closing was cleared , they had a notary sent to my job (as I was working) the same night. The credit card checks were sent to me overnight, and it all worked out!
I will refinance in 8-12 months, with Garrett, to lower my interest rate. He was very patient with me, called me back immediately, and replied to my emails quickly....

I did call four different lenders to get my house refinanced and see what different kind of options are out there. In the end and he was a perfect choice for refinancing my house. I have refinanced many houses quite a few times in my past years and I can finally say that I've had a good experience with Andy Espineria and Paulina. He was straight forward, respectful and patient with the many questions that I had and the answers that I needed. Always had great communication through email, text message or on phone calls. I do honestly believe he live at work because he answered his phone at all times of the day and evening.😁 A truly free loan at the lowest current interest rate which made me very happy.< /Review>

<review>These people have been calling me over and over and over again for days on end from a fake number in my area code just to get me to answer the phone. They never leave a voicemail. Finally I was tired of them calling me and I called them back from a Google Voice number because I figured it was probably fraud or spam. I got a message that said the number was out of service. Then I called them back with my real number they were calling me on and it patched me and immediately to a person. These are very shady tactics to get me to answer the phone and if you're going to start a business relationship like this by being annoying and dishonest why on Earth would ever refinance something like my mortgage with you? stop harassing potential customers<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>Gene and his associates went out of their way to make refinancing a breeze.  We needed to do immediate repairs on our house due to the wet weather but didn't know how we would finance the projects.  After a quick call to Gene at Ladera, I knew what my best options would be and where to start.  The paperwork came through quickly,  my questions were always answered quickly and thoroughly and the process sped by.  I have been very happy with the professional and excellent service I received at Ladera.  Would definitely use them again.

I’ve tried with different banks and they could not beat Ladera Lending.  As an active duty military member, I really appreciate the top-notch service provided by Ladera Lending.  You will not regret picking this lender.  Thanks, Ladera Lending!

I highly recommend Scott Hemp of Ladera Lending.  Unlike my bank and other lenders, Scott offered reasonable rates upfront without the need for protracted negotiations.  Scott was responsive and communicated professionally with no annoying sales-pitch.  The loan closed timely with no hidden fees.  -Angela (David's wife)<//review>

This was my first time purchasing a house and I had the pleasure of working with Andy Espineira, he was very helpful throughout the entire process. Since this was my first time I was very anxious and always had tons of questions to ask, but he was always available to answer any questions that I had and explain everything in full detail to me. There was never a time that I contacted him and he was unavailable. He has extraordinary customer service and I would love to work with him again. He made this process very easy for me. There was some issues during this process but he was able to give me advice as to how to fix it. I will be looking forward to working with him again during my refinancing!! :)

Thanks Andy!!!!< /review>

<Text>My wife and I just went through a refinance to get rid of our FHA loan. Chris Coble at Ladera Lending was amazing. He made the whole process run smooth from start to finish. He answered all of our questions and made everything understandable. What stood out to both my wife and I was that Chris was genuine. He was very kind over the phone, and we could tell right away he was a man of integrity.  Even though we had some distance between us, we never felt it, Chris was always there. We would highly recommend Chris to anyone.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I had the pleasure of working with Jeff Wade at Ladera Lending, and he made the refinancing process stress free by being in constant contact with me and was always available for questions, even after hours and on weekends. I shopped for my refi from other lenders, but when I had a chance to personally talk to Jeff, I chose Ladera Lending. I had a few obstacles and an appraisal that didn't go my way, but Jeff made the loan possible by working his magic. He was able to get my interest rate locked in lower than I expected and decreased my monthly payment by 5%! I recommend Ladera Lending to anyone needing a mortgage!</Review><userid>108440825725045506288</userid>< name>

I had a great experience with Ladera Lending. Patrick Creavy was amazing.  He was always available and on the rare occasion that he missed my call (he usually answered right away) he was able to return the call right away.  He found the exact right loan for me and the process was painless. There were no surprises!  It was a pleasure to work with Patrick and Ladera Lending.<//Text>

We have refinanced using Bob Soto, who works for Ladera Lending, and we were very pleased with the service we received, and Bob’s expertise.   Everything was completed on time, there were no snags in the process, and there were no dropped balls or surprises.  Bob is very detail oriented, and really puts the customer first.  He is an expert and a true professional. We would definitely be willing to use his services in the future, and have already recommended him to many of our friends.<//Text>

I had recently refinanced my home with Ladera Lending in Ladera Ranch. It was such a great and easy experience. I had never refinanced before or had even thought about it until their call center called. I spoke to someone who connected me with them and I am so glad they did! I would highly recommend Ladera Lending if you are purchasing a home or refinancing the current loan you have.< /Text>

I worked with Andy Espineira on my loan.  Was the smoothest and most efficient loan process I have ever had.  Andy found me a fantastic rate and within 5 weeks of contacting Andy, I was funded.  I never left the house, everything was arranged by Andy from the Appraisal, Loan Docs and even had the notary come to the house for signing.

Highly recommend Andy to anyone needing a home loan.  Thanks Andy.< /review>

I'm a first time homebuyer using a VA loan. Did not know how to go about it. Spoke to another VA lender before talking to Shawn, and Shawn had given me the breakdown on how the VA loan works without any shenanigans, and even utilized my benefits as veteran to my advantage. Hooked me up w/ a great agent too. Excellent in communicating on time w/ client-me. Very patient. Closed in 5 weeks as he promised. Pretty much did the impossible for me. My experience w/ Shawn was life changing. Would definitely recommend to fellow vet and colleagues!< /review>< Pics>

I was contacted by Patrick at Ladera lending and he took the needed time to explain to me the 15 yr mortgage with the every two week payment schedule which knocks the loan down to 13 yrs. Patrick was very helpful with all the paperwork. Thank you for helping me to see the end of the tunnel on getting my home paid for once and for all.</review>

<Text>Shawn Moore from Ladera Lending has provided EXCELLENT Service

Shawn Moore from Ladera Lending has helped me from Day one. With everyone else calling me to push an agenda, score me as a customer, or just push push push a sale, but Shawn was patient with me and instructed me all the way through the process. He even allowed me to go out on my own and verify everything that was on the market to ensure he could provide and deliver on the interest rates and timelines as promised. That's why I keep coming back for my future needs. Here I know I will not get the run around and know all my needs will me met with integrity. Thank you so much!

<review>Shout out to Brock Amos for absolutely crushing it when it came to our home loan. We got an obscene amount of pushback for wanting to use a non-local lender, but I stuck to my guns and said I was going with Brock or no deal. Right out the gate, everyone understood why I wanted to go with this tenacious lending wizard. Brock had everything ready to go within 5 days, communicated to everyone through out the whole process and pretty much made everyone know what time it was. Can't recommend this guy enough!!!</review><resp>None<//resp><userid>112343958676214420335< /userid>< Rating>

<review>They cold call. Their techniques include posing as your current mortgage lender. In my case, that was a complete lie. Do you want to put your finances in the hands of people who lie to get business?

They don't have a business relationship with me. They texted my cell phone. They're willing to break the law to get cash from me. Don't you want your mortgage lender to actually be ethical?</review>< Pictures>

I worked with Tommy on my refinance. He is very knowledgeable ,flexible and and works quickly. Prior to working with Tommy I was working with a different lender who was still in the process of gathering information after four months. Tommy and his team completed my refinance in three weeks. Tommy always responded to emails and voicemails timely. Do not hesitate to use this company if you're looking for mortgage financing. I certainly will use them again. Ask for Tommy!!!< /text>

<Text>This is the second time I finance my home mortgage with Ladera Lending. Their commitment to customer satisfaction, their level of care, responsiveness and honesty is unequalled. Financing a home loan is one of the more difficult processes a person can go through, but the team at Ladera Lending took the difficulty out of it on my behalf. They scheduled all the events with the appraisals, the notaries, the title companies and the documentation, the payouts of existing loans. I was fortunate to work with Paul Lemerise, he didn't just come through for me but he really went the extra few miles. I have already recommended Ladera to friends and family and I recommend them to you.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Me and my husband had a great experience working with Jeff Wade from Ladera Lending inc. We tried to do it with other lenders and none of them have been as successful and helpful as Jeff. He is a very friendly person and is very patient, so far everything is going smooth and he is working very hard to help us. We highly recomend Jeff to anyone looking for a good helpful lender.</Text>

I see that several people had positive experiences with Ladera Lending. My experience was on the opposite end of the spectrum. I have been told that we were at the finish line and ready to close since December. Initially my rep was responsive and on the ball. As we moved through the process I was told that they needed 1 or 2 more items to close several times. Each time I submitted what was asked for within hours and didn't receive any reply for days. I would have to call for updates and at times still took days to get back to me. It is a frustrating experience to say the least. Finally they came back with stipulations that made no sense for what was happening with the home. The loan was to do home improvements, and a s stipulations to fund they wanted a wall that was set to be removed to be painted, and for carpet to be laid in rooms that we're set to be sanded and painted. I turned in the work order to show that all of this work was set to be completed but it made no sense to spend money to complete things that would have to be removed as soon as the loan was funded. They also asked that I pay for a 2nd opinion on the appraisal. They we're the ones who chose the initial appraiser so if they don't trust his appraisal after I was forced to spend $500 with who they selected I shouldn't be on the hook for a 2nd opinion. In closing I was told if I did XYZ that we could move forward with closocl several times. The final straw was the redundant repairs that they wanted completed before funding, and requiring me to pay for a 2nd opinion on an appraisal that they selected the appraiser. I refused to spend more money because for 2 months I was promised a closing that never happened and there was no garunrtee on a closing date even if I did complete these steps. I feel like I wasted time and money and I wish that I would have went with another lender out of the gate, because now I am back at square 1 having to start the process all over again with a new lender.< /Text>

My husband and I recently used Ladera Lending to refinance our home.  We had an excellent experience with everyone we were in contact with, including the President, Robert Brown.  They readily returned all of our phone calls.  They explained the process in terms that we could both understand.   I have used other Lending institutions in the past, however,  they could not compare to the wonderful service that we received from Ladera Lending.  I would highly reccomend this company to anyone that wants to refinance their home.  Good job Ladera Lending, we really appreciate you!<//Text>

We recently worked with Jeff Wade to refinance our mortgage, he walked us thru the process making it very easy to understand each step and charge along the way.  My husband isn't the easiest person to work with Jeff explained everything with a great deal of patience to our satisfaction.  I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a loan.</Text>

<review>WOW !!!! Keith Howard is amazing i have never gone through the loan process so quickly without having a million questions. Keith knew everything before i even had to ask. On top of that i saved over 500 a month and even got some cash to go on vacation. Now that's what i call service. i highly recommend Keith Howard at Ladera Lending Make sure you ask for him you wont be disappointed.< /review>< Date>

After almost 5 months of trying to refinance a rental unit with no luck, i can finally put that to rest. Shawn Moore provided information that helped me close the deal quick, the staff is very professional and they have a good follow up routine that works for both parties. I recommend them.</review>

After comparing rates with my local companies, I found the best rates with Ladera. I was a bit hesitant to work with an online company to refinance but after reading the reviews and talking with Shawn Moore I felt more at ease. Working with Shawn and Marco was a plus, thankful for all their guidance and help through the process. I would absolutely look to Ladera Lending in the future for our mortgage needs as well as refer them to our friends and family.</review>

I just finished my refinance with them. I was very happy overall. first off let me say I am very particular about who I do business with. I need someone who is always available and quick to answer questions since I always have them. Let me just say, I found everything I was looking for and more in Chris Coble. He is the best loan officer I have ever talked to. He is humble, efficient, available, and responsive. He made the process as simple as possible and I would definitely recommend working with him if you are looking to Refinance< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dcedcd12da4c61:0xa07bfe69ef0320f7<//gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate>< name>

<text>Very pleased with our experience with Andy Espineira at Ladera Lending. Andy was professional, friendly, and helpful. We got an excellent rate, and the PMI will drop off automatically once we have 80% loan/value. The process was much more streamlined and hassle-free than I recall from other mortgages we have obtained. Thank you, Andy and Ladera.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Terrible telemarketing scam.  Called a "do not call" telephone number.  Explain to the tool on the end of the call.  He said"  Hey, hey I'm talking here ......."  Don't trust senior lending executives who employee these kind of people.  The call was placed at 2:40 PM on 4/6/2018.  They can find the culprit if they spend 3 minutes looking.<//Text></record>

Finishing up our second refinance with Ryan Onaka and I have nothing but good things to say about him! Working with him and his team has been a pleasure. They are efficient, friendly, courteous and most of all- they get the job done! So thankful for the little postcard I received in the mail some years ago directing me to Ladera Lending!!!<//Review>

Thank You Paul Lemerise and Ladera Lending!

I want to say that working with Ladera Lending was a pleasant surprise, the whole experience was surprisingly quick and easy. I received a rate that was better than expected, and Paul was more than thorough and updated me regularly with the status of my loan. I never waited overnight for an answer to a question. It was nice to do much of the process through email. If you ever need to refinance, I highly recommend Paul Lemerise at Ladera  Lending< /text>

I was referred to Ladera Lending from a friend who had a great experience with this company. I am glad I chose Ladera for my refi the process was seamless they where constantly keeping me informed on the process. I have had to refinance in the past and had used a couple different companies along the way and none of my previous experiences with other companies were even close to the the quality of service I received from Ladera Lending.<//text>

I highly recommend Ladera Lending and specifically Brian Spinuzzi. If you are looking for someone you can trust, look no further. He helped my wife and I on our first refinance and he explained it step by step. I never felt overwhelmed as I did when we purchased our home. I will be using Brian and Ladera Lending for all of my future loans.< /Review>

While the initial loan process seemed good.  At the time to of finalization of loan after underwriting the loan rate was changed. i was guaranteed rate of 4.125 and i was offered 4.5. I had to cancel the loan process. I was complete wastage of 10-12 hours of time over a period of a month.<//Text>

<text>Thanks to Paul Lemerise and the Ladera Lending team I am officially a first time home buyer!  My case was a special one- my financial background made my loan complex and where other loan companies wouldn't even grant an offer letter, Ladera Lending found a way to finance the home of my dreams.  I   am SO grateful to Paul and the entire team for the dedicated work to making my loan happen!

The additional perks of working with Ladera Lending was their area specific knowledge, their resources, their guidance, their patience and their expertise.  Paul was professional and prompt and consistently answered all my questions (and there were A LOT).  Most importantly Paul made MY financial benefits his priority.  He guided me through the best interest rates, the best ways to set up my loan, and the biggest payback on my loan choices.  I felt safe and secure with my choices and I didn't once have to question whether or not I was being guided in the right direction.

Thank you to Paul Lemerise and Ladera Lending for making my dreams come true!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< user_name>

I'm not one to write reviews,  but this one is defiantly worth my time. Tommy Osbourne was referred to me from Ladera Lending, I'm a disabled veteran who was skeptical from the beginning about getting a cash out refi on my home.  Tommy was able to cure my skepticism when it came a new 25 year loan.  Tommy is a very patient man and I can tell you every time I needed to get a hold of him he always responded when he could and it was always within a very short time.   Tommy answered all of my questions over and over again and never grew impatient with my need to know that everything was going to be fine. Unbeknown to both of us we ran into a little hiccup that could of derailed my desire to miss 2 payments, I had unexpected situation come up, but Tommy assured me over and over that we would close on time.  I honestly lost a little of my faith along the way because of the unexpected situation but Tommy stepped out of the loan officer role and assured me that things were going to be OK and he was going to do everything in his power to close this deal on time.  Tommy kept his word from the moment that I met him.  He is the most honest and caring loan officer I've ever met; he is a super trooper! I was very fortunate to have Tommy handle something so important and complicated as getting a new loan,  however I do want to thank the professional team that was behind Tommy!  Ladera Lending is truly number one; they got me the loan I wanted and they saved me thousands of dollars!< /Text>

We refinanced with Patrick Creavy! Great service, he has a lot of experience and make the deal work! He has everything typed out and will take his time to explain everything in detail. The processing of the loan might suck, but he will make everything work out in the end. We plan on working with him again!

We just completed our refinance withe Ladera Lending.  Tommy Osborne, of Ladera Lending handled the refinance.  Tommy was very knowledgeable and and extreme pleasure to work with.  One of the best things about working with Tommy was his consistent communication with us during the process. I don't mean just e-mails, I mean real "old fashioned" personal conversation with us by phone. This way we were able to give and receive information in real discussion.  He answered all our questions fully and in ways that we could clearly understand, and made us fee that he was there to help us get through our refinancing timely and efficiently.
Whatever he said he would do, he followed through every time.
Also, every day that I talked with Tommy he was very cheerful, personable and inspiring.  It was a joy to talk with him every time.  Even when a refinance issue would arise, Tommy always had good recommendations and skillfully and pleasantly addressed any concerns we had to get to workable resolutions. Tommy demonstrated their desire and ability to make every part of the experience efficient, convenient and pleasurable from application to qualifying, to appraisals, to titling and escrow, to document signing and closing.

I have always referred to mortgage financing as "financing Hell".  In this case Tommy Osborne and Ladera Lending made our refinancing a pleasurable experience, and demonstrated that mortgage lending does not have to be a "torturous event".

Thank you again and again Tommy Osborne and Ladera Lending. We really appreciate your great work.  If every person at Ladera Lending is as courteous and professional as Tommy, is is not surprising that your company success as a mortgage lender thrives and should continue to do so.

Just a short note to say what a great experience it was to refinance our adjustable rate mortgage to a fixed rate and shortening its length to 15 years. This was all done from the comfort of my easy chair and computer terminal at our home here in Glendale, AZ thanks to Patrick Creavy. He kept us informed at every step of the way and managed to expediently fix the few glitches we experienced at title closing. Ladera Lending is fortunate to have a skilled, courteous, and knowledgeable broker with Patrick on board! We intend to refer any family and friends needing the services of a mortgage lender/broker in the future to Ladera Lending and specifically to Mr. Creavy!  Thanks to Ladera Lending and Patrick Creavy for the GREAT experience!</review>

Patrick Creavy from Ladera Lending did an awesome job of being honest, up-front, and explained the entire process for doing a refinance for us to eliminate our PMI and get out from under an FHA loan that was killing us.

I would suggest that anyone whom wants a loan to contact Ladera Lending, and specifically ask for Patrick Creavy, as he is a great broker to deal with.

He even has provided great advice to have us improve our credit score so that we can apply for a new consolidation loan after six months to also reduce our payments and get a much better rate.< /Review>

<review>When I decided to refinance the house, I jumped on line and entered my information, including the fact I'm a vet,  into a mortgage information provider. They said they would forward my information to 5 lenders. Ha! Try 20. However, it was well worth the aggravation of dealing with all those phone calls and emails, because in the end I found Patrick Creavy of Ladera Lending.

A couple of the lenders offered decent interest rates and plenty of information. Fortunately, Patrick came on board before I actually signed with one of them. The other two lenders told me the VA funding fee was a waste of money. Patrick explained the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL) program associated with the VA. If, at any point, interest rates fall, a vet can apply for an IRRRL. No appraisal, no title fees, no income verification. It's just a lowering of the rate. I was furious at first. I had purchased my home with a VA loan initially. I had refinanced 3 times for the sole purpose of lowering the interest rate. Every one of those financial institutes had talked me out of VA. The initial refinance had not told me about IRRRL. Why would they? Less money in their pocket. When I expressed this to Patrick, he assured me it wasn't deliberate. Most lenders do not specialize in VA, and are therefore ignorant of the benefits. Their ignorance cost me more than $28,000.

Patrick is friendly, honest, and knowledgeable. He believes in communication, and kept me abreast during the entire process. I  am amazed by the quality of his customer service; he's one in a million. I now consider him my personal loan advisor. I have been distributing his cards to friends and family. Need I say more?I would recommend him to anyone, but especially to veterans.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

If you are attempting to buy a home or refinance, Chris Coble at Ladera Lending is someone you want to have working alongside you.  He is experienced, honest, down to earth, and offers you sound advice.  I picked up on this during our first phone conversation, never considered shopping around, and never regretted or second-guessed my decision.  I was an inexperienced homebuyer, and he took the time to explain things in detail throughout the whole process.  I was able to benefit from his expertise and learned a lot from him in a short amount of time.  Logistically, Chris was extremely organized, always reachable, and efficient which allowed for a smooth and quick transaction.  I have already recommended him to a family member and a friend, and am grateful that our paths crossed.  You will be in good hands working with Chris Coble.  There is no doubt about that.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I am writing this review of Loan Officer Brian Brown.

I used Brian when my wife and I purchased our home in northern CA.  He is easily one of the most knowledgeable and skilled loan officers I have ever dealt with.  The biggest thing that sticks out is that he is ALWAYS available.  I have dealt with loan officers in the past that "just stepped out" or don't return your calls and nothing is more annoying when you have a question or want to know the progress of your loan.  I have found that Brian is easy to get ahold of and returns my calls faster than expected.

I also know that Brian was able to get me THE BEST rate available.  I compared his rates to several other banks and two credit unions and he beat them hands down.  I have referred seven of my friends and two of my bosses to him and he has consistently performed as promised.  As you know, you would never take a chance referring your boss to someone that you didn't have full confidence in.

One of my friends I referred to him was hesitant to call because he wasn't ready to get a loan just yet.  I told him to call anyways and ask Brian questions about what he needed to do in preparation of getting a loan.  Brian talked to him for almost 30 minutes, knowing he wasn't going to be doing a loan for him, but just to give him the information he needed.  Impressive.

In all fairness, he does seem to ask for more documentation than other loan officers have in the past, but I believe that is because he wants to make sure he has all his "ducks in a row" and can put out any potential fires before they begin.  I'll gladly spend an extra 30 minutes gathering docs he needs to save THOUSANDS or TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars over the life of my loan.

If I can add one more reason on why you should use this specific loan officer - NO SURPISE CHARGES at doc signing.

He's also completed my refi about 6 months ago.  Again, wonderful experience.  Give him a call, you won't be disappointed.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Great service from Andy Espineira!

After going thru a few purchases and many refinances, I cannot speak more highly of our recent experience. Andy worked with us on all aspects of this process. Always very clear, concise and professional, he was easy to work with, in a process that is not always fun or simple. He was still able to get us funded after being told by others that it was not possible and with a better rate than we imagined. We were given a lead time that was really good for funding and they beat that estimate by eight days. I believe we got some emails from other employees requesting information but all main contact was from Andy Espineira. We highly recommend him!< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>To say I had a great experience with Patrick Michael Creavy is an understatement. My wife and I were helped by Patrick since day 1. Patrick gave me a call and explained my situation with regard to the possibility to refinance my house. Everything was clear no gimmicks, no tricks and he was genuine and straightforward. Before and after Patrick's call, my wife and I had received many phone calls from other companies looking to provide the same refinancing services but to no avail because we felt gimmicks, exaggerations of facts and over promising.

In a nutshell, Patrick did an excellent job throughout and I'll recommend him to anybody who want to know everything about house refinancing. Patrick called everyday to us updates, and suggestions and he'll always let us make the final decision. We never felt pushed or gamed while working with Patrick. In the end, my wife and I are very delighted to have worked with Patrick and we're looking forward to doing it again in the near future.

I was referred to Chris Coble by another party who contacted me to see if I was interested in refinancing my home.  I was not in the market for refinancing options because we plan on selling our house within the next two years and plus I didn’t want to reduce the equity we had in the house and pay less on principle each month.  So let’s just say I wasn’t very interested in talking about refinancing at all… well that was until I spoke to Chris.  I mentioned the above concerns to Chris and he understood my concerns and told me that he could save me $200-$400 a month on my mortgage payment.   While not decreasing the equity in my home significantly by utilizing the VA refinancing options, and there is a possibility we wouldn’t have to make payments for the first two months.  Chris volunteered to send me some numbers that reflected our conversation, I also did my own mortgage amortization calculations and came up with very similar numbers.  At that point I decided to do move forward with VA refinancing option, thanks to Chris.  I’m a hard person to convince and live by the motto DTA (Don’t Trust Anyone).  So for Chris to get me to trust him in getting us the best rate and options for our mortgage is a testament to him and his dedication to his profession.

So, then begins the process of submitting documents and filling out applications.  Compared to our first mortgage process this one was very streamlined and a majority of it was completed online, without having to leave the comfort of my home, matter of fact I never had to leave my home to complete any portion of the process.  Chris was there every step of the way, following up via email, text and or telephone.  We probably spoke more via text than any other communication means, which I preferred.  If it wasn’t for the VA taking its time we probably would have had the entire process completed within 30 days, however the government being the government it took a little longer (approximately 60 days from application submittal to closing).

The time we had schedule for closing was right around Christmas and New Years, and we didn’t plan on being in town during this time and would be out of the state visiting family.  I thought this would put a delay in our process but Chris and his company scheduled a Notary to come to the location where we were vacationing to sign our documents.  However, we were unable to close while on vacation due to the aforementioned delays at the VA.  So we closed within the comforts of our home two days after returning for vacation, we got a great rate, I think we pay about $325 less a month, we pay pretty much the same amount to principle and the balance on the loan only went up about $3500.  I would recommend Chris to anyone of my friends looking to refinance or looking to acquire a mortgage for a new purchase.  When we are looking for our new home in the next year or so, we will definitely be contacting Chris for assistance with another mortgage.</Text>

I was initially skeptical when I was cold called by Ladera Lending, however after comparing refi estimates refi with those from my original lender I decided to give it a shot. My refi was handled by Brian Spinuzzi and he was very patient explaining the intricacies of the refinance process to me and was always ready to given me extra information when I requested it. He even provided me with his home number which was useful when I needed a last minute clarification during the document signing. I was very happy both with the loan and the process and I highly recommend Brian and Ladera Lending.</review>

<user>115285240686468588866< /user><review>They didn't lock rates as promised, didn't close escrow on time as promised, what else can I say. I didn't check their yelp reviews before engaging with this company and that was a huge mistake. If I had seen their yelp reviews I would have stay away from this company. Now looking at the reviews on yelp I felt exactly the same thing.< /review></record>

Ladera made the home lending process simple and fast. Michael Pendergast walked me through the process and made sure everything was handled quickly and with ease. I was actually using another lender but canceled after an initial conversation with Mike. And I'm glad i did, he was able to lower my closing costs.<//Review>

<Text>Jaekoo was great to work with. He took his time and explained everything and I could tell that he is a very hard working man and very good at his job because it went fast and smooth. I would recommend him to anyone and most importantly he had the best rate and the lowest costs. Thanks G<//Text>< gmapID>
