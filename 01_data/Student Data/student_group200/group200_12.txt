Absolutely the BEST in California! I have been going to Cliff for years for my Mini Cooper and he's amazing. I first had taken my car to the Mini Dealership and I was absolutely shocked by the price and my friend recommended Cliff instead. Since then, I only go to him. Super trustworthy, responsive, and knowledgeable. Can't recommend him enough! If you have a BMW or Mini Cooper, don't look anywhere else - go to him!< /text>

Cliff and the team are  exactly what I look for in any professional, trustworthy, transparent and efficient.   The BMW dealer diagnosed an issue and found the absolutely most expensive solution.  Cliff at Bay Motor Works looked at the same issue and found the accurate solution which cost 80% less.   This level of honestly and trust is something sadly lacking from the authorized dealer and means I will use Bay Motor Works for all my future service needs</Text>

Mr. Clifford Kwong, of Bay Motor Works is an excellent mechanic. Infuse with integrity and honesty. He and his team have showed ability or instinct to begin to follow through energetically with a plan to repair your vehicle. I left a repair shop of several years infuriated. Went to Bay Motor works, they check everything and brought it back to excellent running condition to my complete satisfaction. I highly recommend this shop, you can’t go wrong. Try them.<//text>

The inner roof, ceiling, headliner (?) of my car was disintegrating and falling off.  Ugly.  Somehow we found Mike at Bay Motor Works, and he worked a miracle on the inside of my 30 year old Toyota.  A photo would not show the excellent work.  You'll just have to trust me.< /Text>

<text>I've been taking my 2000 BMW M5 to Bay Motor Works. Clifford is very communicative and does a great job explaining exactly what needs to be done. His work is great, and he always goes the extra mile to make sure things are done right. His prices are very reasonable, always a fraction of what the dealer would charge. I wouldn't take my BMW anywhere else.</text></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My experience with Bay Motor Works was the best I’ve ever had with a car repair service. The dealership had the car for 72 hours and couldn’t diagnose the problem. Clifford, the shop owner at Bay Motor Works, started testing the car on a Monday morning, called me right away with the diagnosis & cost and had my Mini fixed and ready to go by 2pm the same day. He explained that Mini drivers should check the oil every month and he taught me how to do it. He also advised me to keep an eye on the coolant. Clifford is knowledgeable, skilled, professional and personable. I will be taking my car to Bay Motor Works as long as I own it.

I always have issues with keeping my car in alignment, generally have to do two a year. The dealership always just gets it within the spec range. Clifford and crew spend over an hour aligning the car getting it to drive just perfect. 8 years — and my car has never driven this well. Happy 2012 550i customer here.</Text>

I switched from the BMW Service to Bay Motor Works a few years ago and haven't been happier. The service is great, the Cliff is knowledgeable and very honest. Unlike many other shops, I feel that Cliff recommends what he feels is necessary but doesn't push extra services that aren't. I would highly recommend Bay Motor Works to anyone.</review>

Clifford has been my go-to mechanic on my MINI for the past 6 years. He is well verse on MINI's issues and very accurate on his diagnostic.
He is not cheap but he is honest and that's important in my books.<//Review>

<review>Cliff has worked on my 528i for over 3 years. He's done a great job with oil changes and engine repairs. He's a genuine guy and not a pushy mechanic.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

<text>Cliff knows his business.  He is considerate and polite, always willing to help and charges very reasonable prices.

My BMW 528i was having a continued problem of the battery getting discharged continually.  I had 2 other mechanics look at it.  They replaced several parts, charged over $3000 and could not fix the problem.  I was almost ready to sell the car for junk and I decided to take it to Cliff.  Cliff assured me he could find the problem and he did exactly that.  He took the time needed (more than 2-3 days) to nail down the problem to a faulty part and replaced the part.  All for less than $600 with parts!

I now take my car to Cliff and no other place.  I strongly recommend him.  THIS is what good business is all about!</text>< pics>

Cliff always takes great care of my 2008 BMW 335xi. It's easy to get in for an appointment and he does the great work for an honest price.< /Text>

Honest, Great, and trustworthy mechanic. Clifford has kept my BMW running for nearly 20 years. He knows BMWs and has always let me know what needs to be done immediately and what can wait. As long as I drive BMWs, Clifford will be my mechanic.< /review>

People who know Cliff know that he is honest, fair, and very good at what he does; we bring our VW rabbit here and have always gotten good service and flexible times to drop off and pick up our car.< /Review>

The only reason I am giving Subway three stars, because I wasn't able to use my EBT card. But they should let their customers know if they have that sticker on the window that we are able to use their EBT card. I had a very nice customer who paid for my sandwich and I was so grateful for her thank you.<//review>

I have visited this site 3 times and each time I the charges differ.

I noticed when I visited during the day I got 1 scoop of pastrami for my footlong sandwich and all the veggies I wanted.

Go for the same sandwich at night I got 2 scoops of pastrami and told the sandwich was full and could not get all the veggies I wanted.

Plus the evening woman who works the counter is more rude claiming her boss won’t let her give all the veggies you ask for.

She is very skimpy when making your sandwich plus she doesn’t cut the bread open all the way. A trick I noticed she did to put less toppings.

Perhaps other customers have had better experiences. But I wanted to advise people about these differences I noticed when buying my sandwich.</review>

Might be a good place.... I called to buy a tire for my Harley. He said sure no problem... Come by leave it here for 3 days!!!! TO CHANGE A TIRE!!!! I have 49 other bikes here. This place was about 150.00 cheaper than eagles nest Harley... But I use my bike daily for work....bit the bullet went to eagles nest it was done in one hour.<//review>

<Review>Awesome shop. These guys do it all. Super honest and fair pricing. Always get the job done right and stand behind their work.
If you need anything from motor work to tires and a quick oil change Chad sam and Gabe will get it done for you. They have helped me out a bunch of times and I will always go back< /Review>< pictures>

Every one here is extremely helpful. I'm not even a HUGE H.D. guy, but I bought one because I know these guys are honest. When the owner isn't fully knowledgable about something I'm asking about, he usually takes me to Sam, who has never not had an answer for me. Great Shop! If they sold bikes they would have put 'Beatles Nest' out of business by now!
I've even called & talked to Sam minutes before closing & he's taken the time to answer my questions. Nothing I don't like about these guys!</Review>

On Google maps it said that the shop was openfrom 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. and once I arrived the shop was closed Google maps needs to be updated with the new hours of operation otherwise than that I would have given him five stars</text>

Fast service, knowledgable Harley-Davidson trained technicians.  Parts inventory on hand for brakes and accessories.  Major and minor repairs.  Tires in stock or special order with mounting/balancing on stock or custom wheels.  They have worked on three of my Harleys and I recommend them.  Honest work and reasonable shop rates.<//Text>

Had my best car buying experience ever with Mini of Concord. Easy to agree on a price, F&I was low pressure ( not the usual torture fest), and  easy and quick signing documents and vehicle prep.  Wow, so much better !< /Text>

<Text>Wow! The level of incompetency at this place is hard to describe, let's just say it's astronomical. Although the lovely gentleman who did not help me apologized for my "frustration" he really should have apologized for the dealership's incompetency. I'm sorry you are incapable of running a business. But good luck with everything!<//Text>< Pictures>

bought a certified mini (countryman 2018) 2 months ago. Check engine light just went off for the 4th time.  Boy,  I really regret buying this mini!!!!.   been taking it to east bay mini to evaluate.  They are very professional but the repeat issue tells me it is the car and not the dealer.  I reached out to my salesman from concord mini.... crickets.   May be heading to Honda soon.  So depressing<//Review>

<Text>Looking for a new car about a year ago, MINI entered the discussion. Watched Doug DeMuro's review of the 2019 Countryman ("Better than you think!") Entranced by the interior aesthetics, started taking test drives around south bay dealerships and was not disappointed. Started chatting with Michael Chavez at Concord MINI and made the drive, totally worth it, he and Sergei were great and I ended up purchasing that day. It's been 9 months and the car is amazing, I smile every time I get in. Driving less during shelter-in-place, so when I do, it's sport mode, every time :)< /Text>< user_name>

<Date>1583941662272</Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Brought my car in there for service on a Monday and they told me they were closed on Mondays because they don't generate enough service business to open the service center. So I came back on Tuesday and they told me that I needed an appointment because they're too busy since San Francisco Mini closed they are taking in all of their service.  I said fine can I leave my car there and you guys can get to it throughout the week when you can. They said sure we can do that and then they asked if I needed a ride somewhere and they would provide a ride. I asked if they had any loaner vehicles and they said no they are all out right now. I asked him how many loaner vehicles they had and they said about 20.  But apparently they aren't busy enough to be open Mondays. I told them I needed my car looked at because it failed smog and they told me the diagnostics would cost $410. I asked if that could be attributed to the repairs and they said no the diagnostics is a separate cost. I got a call the next day and they tell me that they repairs on my car are going to cost $2,900 plus the diagnostic charge of $410. I decline the repairs and rode my bike over and said I just want to take the car and I'll get a second opinion and they said it won't be ready till this afternoon to be picked up when I was there now at the Mini dealership after having rode my bike 4 miles there to pick it up.  He did say he would go and see if he can get it ready and it was ready to go in only 5 minutes. So that I appreciated!! But I felt like I had to persuade him like I bothered him to ask if it could be made sooner.   I really don't feel well treated here!  I'm from LA and the service center and MINI dealership in Torrance by my house was fantastic compared to this dealership.  They always had a loaner vehicle for me when my car was being serviced and they never told me that the service center is closed due to lack of business. They treated me WELL and always took care of me! Not impressed at all Mini if Concord!!!!!!<//Review>< pictures>

NOT impressed  at all with this dealership! called dealership for DMTL service which  has a 10yr/120k warranty (which my countrymen fell within). after leaving car at dealership and picking up loaner, received call saying 'based my vin # repairs are not covered'. concord mini refused to hornor mini campaign  warrenty extension..Jacob in service and his 'manager' Rafalle are perfect examples of what's wrong with car dealerships..<//text>

Michael Chavez was the person who helped me lease my 2019 Countryman this year.  The service was stellar: no pressure, no unnecessary haggling, no misrepresentations.  Everything was straightforward and prompt.  They gave me the best deal they could.</review>

<Text>Service Department.
My long-standing mechanic ran the diagnostic on my Mini and told me what was wrong and why an engine light was on. He recommended I go to the dealer for the repair.

I contacted another independent Mini garage for a second opinion. I learned that there was a factory warranty extension on the part that diagnosis #1 showed as failing. (high pressure fuel pump)

With reluctance this second source said go to Mini as it is a warranted repair. I told this garage that my first choice mechanic had reset the 'lights'. She told me that the computer in my car still retained the 'event' and that it would be found.

I went to Mini of Concord. I had to wait a week for am appointment that provided me with a loaner car. There are no repairs while you wait, even if it is only the $205 diagnosis. In on Thursday with the promise of an answer the following Tuesday. You read that right.

Mid afternoon the following Tuesday I received a call from the service rep that my car needed new plugs and the fuel injectors cleaned. $600. No mention of the high pressure fuel pump that was originally ferreted out by one source and confirmed to be problematic and warranty work by the second source.

I asked if the technician looked at the print-out I had brought indicating the problem was a fuel pump and was told the plugs and the injector cleaning were all that was needed.

The plugs were less than three months old. Factory equipment. Installed elsewhere when I had the car in for a scheduled service.

The service rep minimized the fuel injector clean out, likening it to a can of over the counter clean-out product and that the entire service wouldn't take that much longer. $600 and not the real problem.

Mini of Concord did not want to dedicate the time on their analysis equipment to 'reach deeper' into my car's computer. They are inundated with business since the closing of a nearby Mini dealership. They are ill-prepared with an overworked staff and wonderfully, overbooked for tons of future work.

The problem I wanted repaired remains unaddressed and according to  Mini of Concord they have no way of confirming the problem is real despite the independent print out I provided and ignoring the question as to their full, in-depth analysis capabilities.

I hope when this problem resurfaces and the engine goes to half-power as it is programmed to do, my family and I are not placed in peril. I no longer trust Mini of Concord</Text><date>1573399822409< /date></record>

Buying a car is stressful and takes long hours as everyone knows, but with Michael's professionalism, friendliness, responsiveness, and attentiveness, I had a wonderful experience. He has been working there for more than 15 years. He is so knowledgeable, and he can answer any questions. I could tell his passion about Mini Cooper and he owns one too. He is genuinely a caring person with wonderful sense of humor which helps for having a good experience.
Thanks so much Michael for helping me and making one of my longing dreams come true. I finally got my MINI Cooper Convertible Sport Package!
I LOVE MY CAR! I ENJOY DRIVING AND CURSING IT! WHAT A FANTASTIC CAR WITH GREAT PERFORMANCE.......

<Text>We worked with Jason on the purchase of our new Mini Cooper. It was the fastest and easiest car deal I’ve ever experienced. We negotiated a price over text over a few days time. Got right to the point on the price. Once we agreed upon a price, we completed the credit app online and spent a total of 20 minutes in the dealership to complete the purchase. The drive to Concord took 6x longer than the actual time we spent at the dealership. Real happy with the price we paid and the ease of the purchase.</Text>< Pictures>

Way overpriced. Wanted to charge me $500 to replace the timing chain tensioner because it was leaking oil. The reason it was leaking oil is because it was loose. I didn't approve the repair and did it myself. It took under 30 minutes with a Leatherman and a 27MM wrench. Retail list price for the part is $72.58 and if memory serves, the line item for the part on the quote was nearly double that. This is why dealership service shops have the reputation they have. The reason for 2 stars instead of one was because customer service was good.< /Review>

<review>Butch was an awesome salesman. He was friendly, energetic and efficient. After the sale was complete he took care of things that add the extra personal touch like placing a large red bow on my new cute little mini, than took several pics of me and my new addition. Everyone in the store was super friendly. There like one big happy family. Thanks Butch and the rest if the mini family!<//review>< gmap_id>

First arrived at Mini of Concord and was looking around. Butch was the first person that came out and greeted us. He gave us space to look around and told us to let him know if we had any questions. After a couple minutes we ended up doing a test drive and just speaking to Butch we already knew he was the right guy to purchase from made everything extremely pleasant and easy. Ended up purchasing the car and couldn't have had a better experience.< /Text>

<review>Literally just left here. Walked around the lot and no rep acknowledge or said hello. Knew the type of car I wanted from online. I walked in and with over a dozen employees and nothing. Not a friendly atmosphere. Highly unprofessional. I do not recommend taking your business here. I will go down the street. Experience and first impression is important. Don’t waste your time here.<//review><UserId.>102042028348804493998</UserId.>< Pictures>

<review>I went into Mini Cooper of Concord about a month ago and had the best car experience a girl could ask for. Sergei Beloi (sales manager) was so welcoming! It was a very busy day there at Mini, Sergei made sure I was taken care of and put me in very good hands. Mark Wilson made sure I walked out of that dealership with the perfect mini. He made sure I test drove all the models I was interested in and I felt no pressure or was I rushed at all. If you're reading this Mark you get an A+! (I'm also a teacher) Thank you so much Mini of Concord so happy I chose to make the drive to Concord instead of going to Mini of Mountain View.<//review>< Pics>

Marcel Morlino is outstanding!!
I have a 2015 Mini Hardtop. I took it on Feb 6, 2017 for its 2-year maintenance, and I had superb customer service!
Marcel helped me right away, and he was just great, very courteous and efficient, reviewed all my information quickly, listened to all I had to say, and took great care of my baby!
He was also the service advisor who helped me last year, and he was just as nice then!
I was given a loaner Mini while my car was being serviced, which was a great opportunity to test the new model. I had my car back that afternoon, free of charge. My Mini is set until next year!
Thanks Mini of Concord, you guys are like family :D</text>

<Review>Great experience all around!

We had a not so great experience with another Mini dealership, who shall not be named, and went to Mini of Concord with some reservations.  However, from the moment I contacted them, before they even opened, Jason had won me over with his responsiveness and friendliness.  The used vehicle I wanted wasn't even on the lot when I called (it was still being cleaned), but Jason ensured that by the time my husband and I made the hour drive to Concord, it was at a stage where we could test drive it.  Jason made the negotiation part a breeze (really because they have things priced so well!) and Alyce made all of the "fun" financing process literally fun.  Our little Mini had to go back for some additional work the next day, so we dealt with Shane, who was a pleasure to work with as well.  They even drove to Tracy, dropped off a loaner and brought the car back when it was ready.  Such service!!

Never get your car serviced here--they wanted to charge me $180 for something an independent shop did in 5 minutes for free (they said it was too easy, they didn't feel right charging me for it.) The work was programming a new key for a Mini.

Avoid getting scammed and overcharged, take your car to an independent shop, even for new key programming.</Text>

<text>Best car shopping experience. Jason Krupa was solid and professional. He helped me to locate the car, offered the most competitive price among all of  other dealerships on my list without any drama, and got me pre-approved on desired financial terms without needing to bother me on the phone a single time. He replied my email questions with simple, solid answers so I did not waste any time. My actual time spent at the dealership was less than 30 min. Highly recommended if you are looking for a new or used Mini in the Bay Area !</text>< user>

<Review>We had a wonderful experience at MINI of Concord thanks to Butch Madayag. Butch was incredibly friendly, helpful and relaxed. He let us guide ourselves toward the car we wanted, and once we found it, he worked with us to shape the deal that worked best for us. We've been around shady car dealers in the past. And Butch was a welcome antidote to all of those bad memories. I cannot more highly recommend a dealer.< /Review>< Rate>

Jason Krupa did an excellent job of setting us up with the perfect mini. Helped guide us through the benefits of leasing vs buying. And overall gave us a wonderful experience. Left with a cooper in an hour.< /Review>

I just got my new special ordered mini copper S there and I am very happy with the services and price I got. Jason is absolutely great!!
I lived in mountain View, so Concord is more than an hour drive for me, but I still think it is way worth it to buy from there. I had looked for mini from couple other dealers closer to my area, they all gave me a lot of pressure in buying. Then I found Jason, communicated with him through phone and emails, he gave me good advice, offered me a price much better than the other mini dealers offered me and the purchasing process was smooth with no problem.
When I picked up my car,  Jason is very knowledgable, he told me all the details about the car.
And he even followup few days after I picked up the car and see how I was doing with it.
Best experience I ever had with a car sales. I will definitely come back in the future.</review>< user_name>

Wow, I see plenty of other people have good things to say about Jason Krupa.  With very good reason.

I'm an Oregonian & asked a couple questions about purchasing from out-of-state via email.  He responded immediately and said even though they sold the specific car I'd emailed about, they would honor the same price on a similar vehicle.  I ended up not buying a car--any car--this spring but these guys will be the first email I send in the fall when I'm fully ready.< /Text>

<Text>Decided to buy a car one day, went online and found a couple in the bay area that I liked, emailed Jason Krupa at MINI of Concord, he replied like at midnight on a Sunday. On Monday, his day off he was emailing and calling and handing us off to another colleague Butch Madayag. Gave us a great deal. Together they provided exceptional and speedy customer service. We drove home with a mini that afternoon less than 24 hours after I decided I wanted to buy a car.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I purchased Mini Countryman from Jason Krupa. He was honest, respectful and I felt zero pressure to rush my decision. Jason was very responsive to my many emails and phone calls. We had most of the deal mapped out before I even set foot in the dealership. Once I sat down with him face-to-face our arrangement did not change except to further accommodate my needs. Not once did he leave me in the office to sweat me out or "forget" what we had discussed. It was the least combative car buying experience I've ever had and I've had a few! I think I was only there about an hour before I was zipping off in my new cutie. I am a hairstylist and when I was speaking to my client (another Mini owner) about my car, she launched into a glowing review of her salesperson. Guess who it was?</review>

<Text>I do not trust car salesmen. That said, there is one exception, Michael Chavez. This guy is straight up honest, helpful, knows his stuff, and is all about making a fair deal and having a happy costumer! I have bought TWO MINIs from Michael and would buy a third when the time comes. He's a good an honest man who believes in the product he is selling. No high pressure, no game playing with managers, he respects customers who come in prepared and knowledgeable--I cannot recommend him highly enough! MICHAEL CHAVEZ ROCKS!!

Scott Sills, Service Manager of Mini Cooper, Concord, California is one of the best, most honest, most capable Service Mgr I ever encountered! After  MY daughter's car was serviced I noticed a chrome molding was missing from the car hood, so I returned it and brought it to their attention. He took care of it fair and square! I HIGHLY RECOMMNED HIM and Mini Cooper Service Dept in Concord, CA for a job well done everytime!<//text>

The people here lack motivation to work; really bad customer service, basically none because both times I was directed somewhere else or they can't get me a loaner till 10 days later.
Updated: So I went home and check online to see when a loaner is available, they actually have it available 4 days later but the person who help me told me 10 days later. To me, he clearly didn't want to work.<//text><GmapID>0x808566da2c1e0d1d:0x8c575885a1ea75d6< /GmapID><rating>1<//rating></record>

Walked in with my Dad to see a hot pre-owned 2016 Tesla.
Michael Chavez hooked up us with a trade in our newer car and even gave us a loaner overnight!  We weren't expecting to even buy a car that night, but Michael and his boss Mr Sergei Beloi (sales manager) had us ready to go and out the door the next day!<//Text>

<Text>Review of Mini of Concord and Jason Krupa

Jason was very knowledgeable about the car we were interested in. He came in early to meet with us as we had a tight schedule to test drive the vehicle and complete all the paperwork and catch a plane that afternoon.<//Text>< pictures>

My husband and I had been looking for a mini for me to replace my miata that got totaled for about 1 month. After a bad buy with a private party, we decided to go dealership route. My husband went to the SF dealership and they has what we wanted (older year Mini Cooper, hardtop S with low miles) but it wasn't on the lot yet. So we visited the Concord one. When we arrived on the lot someone immediately noticed us looking around and asked if we needed help, we did so they sent out a sales person. In comes Michael Chaves. We asked if they had anything like we were looking for. Turns out they had a lease return with less than 20,000 miles in great condition. But we weren't looking for something that new. (the one in SF was a 2002). We opted to check it out anyways. Michael was VERY knowledgeable about the cars. My husband (who drives and works on race cars) knew exactly what he wanted for me and Michael had answers. He even knew how much the car weighed when I asked, no hesitation. (I like light little cars, hence the miata before).  Michael did not pressure us, the car we were looking at was slated to be a CPO but hadn't been completed yet so it wasn't amazing looking. He explained what they do, what a CPO is, etc. We left without feeling like we were violated and tasked to think about it.

We discussed and my husband agreed I could get what I wanted, either the 2002 or the 2012. I hemmed and hawed up until the day we were scheduled to go in and buy. I felt if I didn't get the newer one, I would regret it. So I went with the 2012. Michael was ready for us, and so was the car (my baby car 2.0) when we arrived on Friday night. We test drove it (not necessary but fun) and then settled to agree on the terms. I had a concern that there was damage to the front bumper that hadn't been repaired. For my husband, this was a bargaining tool. In the end, we paid a price we were comfortable with AND they agreed to repair the bumper. Jason, who assisted with the sale was nice as well.

When they went to do the contract, there were others ahead of us and the wait was about an hour. We were able to leave and get dinner and come back when they were ready for us. I cannot remember the women who helped us with the contract but she was good also. After that was done, Michael gave me my keys (complete with Mini key chain!) and spent time showing me the features of the car. I really appreciated this since I am not use to a European car and some things were different, it helped a lot.

I read all the reviews on this dealer before going but I was set on this car and in the end, Michael was GREAT. The process was so smooth and he really made it easy without pressuring us. I would highly recommend this dealer and Michael if you are EVER looking for a Mini. I love my Mini Cooper!<//Review>

<Text>This was my first time buying a car, and Butch changed all my preconceptions of the 'slick' care salesman.

From the initial online inquiry into a pre-owned Mini, Butch was very transparent in what was available - providing detailed specs of all the pre-owned Minis. This was important to me as other salesmen who were closer to San Francisco played coy and gave vague details, all in hopes of getting someone into the dealership.

Once my girlfriend & I arrived at the dealership, Butch was very attentive as to what we were looking for - and didn't steer us to the more expensive option (as an aside, Mini Concord a great selection of pre-owned Countrymen in the B.A.).

In the end, we had a choice of two pre-owned cars with the options we were looking for. Throughout the process, Butch was helpful - he encouraged us to really test-drive both models and helped us get the best deal & financing.  And after the sale, he followed up with phone calls to see if we had any questions or issues with our purchase.

I would highly recommend Butch to anyone looking for a Mini - new or pre-owned.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Name>

<review>They have an excellent selection of meats! And they have plenty in the dairy section and a small bakery section with a large variety. From Plumas Lake to Olivehurst, there is a very limited supply of fresh produce. This place is my first stop when I need something and don't want to drive into Yuba City or Marysville.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Vallan super recomendable. Excellente servicio al cliente, PLUS EVERYTHING NICELY ORGANIZED. TAQUERIA INSIDE. OPEN FROM 8 AM TO 8 PM. Siempre frescos los cortes.  Guerrero tortillas, Gluten free products , lean meats . Tostadas, chicharrones, sabritas, micheladas cups, you name it they have it . Better parking november 2017.<//review>

I went in to the store to shop for swimsuits. After spending time to select a half dozen suits, I asked to try them on. I was told that there were no change rooms but I would have 15 days to return anything I bought. Are you kidding me?!?!?! Buy six swimsuits without trying them on? Obviously, I will not be wasting my time shopping here any more.< /Review>

I wanted to try this restaurant for my Birthday dinner. . Right from the start the dirty martini was one of the best I have ever had. Their fish sole in white wine sauce was very good as well. The fish was very fresh and tasty. Vegetables fresh and crunchy. Owner is great as well.. Fresno is lucky to have this restaurant. We will be coming back for sure to try more dishes here. . Highly recommended.</Review>

<Review>Ever since they left the Fort Washington location they have upped the prices, changed their name, scaled down the portions, shortened their hours and stopped serving a lot of food options. The least they can do is offer a bigger menu and bring back all the food options customers loved. First time I ate at LIMON I fell in love and told my family we would be coming back very often since I had finally found food that was close to that which I grew up eating and there aren’t many other Latin American restaurants in Fresno that are not Mexican! I’m sorry but Mexican food gets old quick and it’s not like the options in the area are the best, very basic and bland, nothing creative or flavorful. Limon had it all so I’m not sure what happened but they went downhill fast.<//Review>< pics>

Very very very very very very good experience.

Tasty Peruvian-centered cuisine.
Quaint ambience.
Attentive service.
Great menu for couples.

If you’re looking for a place to take your sweetie during the Covid shut down, this is the place!

The chef is from Limon which closed down unfortunately. I guess he bought them out somehow. So, I think Limon in a smaller, more quaint setting.

Give them a call!  Keep these guys in business.< /Review>

They owner came to our table personally to greet us and thanks us for coming in. He the explained that the love music would be available many nights throughout the week and on Sundays. We haven’t had a meal this enjoyable, in Fresno, for some time. Thank wonderful job!</text>< Pics>

<Review>Limon went upmarket to Fort Washington and has now dropped down even lower market than where they began near the Villagio shopping center, but the prices are stuck at Fort Washington levels, even though they are now located in a decidedly down market strip mall. The quality of the ingredients appears to have returned to their original levels, and that's a good thing.
The flavors of their food is amazing as always. They coarse cut the fish for their ceviche, which prevents the fish from devolving into a mush. The cheese empanadas are very plain and simple, but oh so delicious.The batter on their Jalea is light and crispy, not at all greasy. The seco de cordero is simply brilliant - well worth the visit.
I love the food there, but just last week, a light lunch for 2 there, without wine or beer was $80, so sadly I will not be going to Limon as often as I'd like to.< /Review>< pics>

Excellence experience as usual. Salmon with spicy sauce with zucchini noodles was best salmon dish I have had. Very tasty and healthy. Great service. And was not too busy for a Friday night. Devine bread pudding was a great way to end the night with coffee.<//review>

Staff was very helpful, food was really good. 5 stars over all yes BUT I would say 3 stars for the 7 dollar imported beer that came in a can lol. 3 stars for the owner hovering over us for 20 minutes after we sent back a plate my gf wasnt liking the flavor of. 10 stars for the best steak I've had in a while. Dont get the risotto like she did lol. Go big or go home.<//Text>

Not worth the price but a decent meal.
I am Peruvian and always seek out out Peruvian restaurants locally and when I travel.
Firstly, the restaurant is fusion so not the best if you're looking for traditional food. The anticucho is not even cow heart (only regular beef). The lomo saltado was very basic and lackluster. AND THEY HAD NO INKA KOLA.

Deserts were very good and the empanada was delicious as well.<//text>

Excellent Food! I wasn't sure what Peruvian food would taste like and it's AMAZINGLY delicious! Fish is fresh and cooked to perfection! I'm usually not a fan of chicken and ALL of the chicken dishes I've eaten are delicious! Wait staff is excellent and VERY knowledge about the dishes and drinks are just as tasty!<//Text>

My favorite spot for delicious peruvian food. This place does it for me. This place has a good design. This place has many great reviews for a reason.<//Review>

The Peruvian food in this place is wonderful! There's choices for the meat eaters (chicken beef, seafood, fish, etc.), as well as the vegetarians (honestly, I didn't look for vegan items). I would highly recommend that first-timers try the lomo or pollo saltado and, for a little sweet alcoholic drink, the chichatini. They have a nice selection of wines as well. The peach bread pudding is also a great choice that rivals any bread pudding that Campagnia might offer. Ambiance wise, it's very nice, definitely nicer than its San Francisco parent. Highly recommend!< /text>

Some of the items we ordered tonight had a lot of flavor, others, not so much. My ribeye was tender and the chimchuri had good flavor, but the steak itself, while tender, was bland. Dire need of salt and pepper. This is the only place I know that has 3 silverware changes and I don't know why...lol. Will not be returning any time soon.<//Review>

This restaurant had some really fun foods and drinks I had never tried before, and I understand from a friend who'd recently been in Peru that they serve lots of Peruvian classics he's never seen in the states before, so that was a treat as well. I'd recommend this restaurant - it's a pleasant surprise in a kind of out of the way location.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Not authentic Peruvian food.
If you really want to savor the seasoning of Peruvian food, this is not the right place. The food doesn't really have the Peruvian flavor.
The food was not really bad but it did not have the Peruvian seasoning. I wanted Peruvian food and I feel that I did not find it in this place.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) I am Peruvian and the food of the place is disappointing and expensive. I understand that there are not the exact ingredients but I have also cooked in the USA and it worked out much better than that. I did not like anything.

The lady that hooked up my pedi was not afraid to dig into my toes and clean them up very well..Could of used a better leg massage...But the nail work was great...Had my eye brows cleaned up she was very good and had very little burn as she tore off the tape...As a man i can say i will be coming back here again...</Text>

I’ve been coming here for pedicures within the past year and even under new management everyone is great. The lady that does the pedicures is very polite and takes her time and doesn’t try to upcharge your service like other places do.< /Review>

I got my nails done Saturday and my nails are already popping off I did a full set with no color just acrylic and they charged 40 dollars they are over priced some are slanted and not shaped rite  verry nice but also very rube if you tell them what they did wrong then had the nerve to tell me to come back Sunday they would fix them after being there for 2 hours smh nvr again it was an embarrassment because I referred friends and family to them as well verry disappointed< /text>

They do the best nails and pedicures in Hemet! However, sometimes they have flies in the establishment. Average prices.< /review>

<Review>Went in yesterday to get a fill and color and less than 2 hours later  the polish on all of my nails got all ugly  and full of air bubbles so I went in the next day to try to get them fixed and they wanted to charge me 8-15 $ dollars extra to fix when the day before I had paid full price for it and even added tip  he even admitted the polish they used was the problem very upset i paid to get my nails all messed up horrible attitude<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I like it, sometimes the fruit taste weird because its left in the refrigerator with other items like other fruits or veggies and since everything has been already cut the odor from the fruits and veggies gets mixed with the watermelon and other fruits and it gives it a weird taste sometimes its taste like the refrigerator smell, always ask to taste the fruit FIRST before buying it.
That's the only reason I gave it 4 star, everything else is delicious, from their paletas, to their shakes and tosti locos and  ice cream... Everything is DELICIOUS. IN THE END I DO RECOMMEND IT... Try it and be your own judge.<//review>

< Review>
This store is known for their delicious paletas.  They're creamy ice cream on a popsicle stick.  The store has more flavors than I can count such as tequila to jamica. Worth the stop when driving on the 101 to Southern California.< /Review>

<review>One stop shop; kitabs, prayer beads, oil perfumes, room sprays, henna cones, incents, abayas and a tailor to make adjustments if you like. Ohh and amazing customer service. Some of the clothes are  a bit pricey but they have alot of detailing that is hand woven. I recommend visiting this place.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Best experience. They have the most amazing selection of abayas, kaftans, hijabs and more. In addition, their customer service skills were impeccable. Very kind and friendly. Definitely would recommend to anyone. My husband and I had visited from Utah and had the most amazing service.

this is a message to the owner: Almost everything is Very pricey at this place for what they have to offer. Yes they have every right to set their price but they should be reasonable. I come here to buy Bakhuur sometimes and clothes. Bakhuurs are very very pricey in comparison to other places and the smell of the Bakhuur’s doesn’t even level up to the prices. I come here because this shop is closer to me but I’d rather travel farther than spend unreasonably on a quality that isn’t worth it. Please work on your prices and be reasonable.< /Review>

My mom bought a Gown from this store and the it had a hole in it and someone sowed it finely to where it is not noticeable,  I called him right away and showed him pix. He promised me either to exchange it, Or give me half of its price,  and I necer have seen the $ nor have I seen an Exchange. WHEN I call him or the store He never answers. HE Will become rich from that $40 i guess. Not Happy with him treating me like that. I WILL REPORT HIM TO THE BBB.
THEY WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS.
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH IT IF ITS TORN OR SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ITEM. I GIVE HIM 0 STAR BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT. 😡😠😡😠<//review>

I love this place it’s amazing and the owner Is what makes this place amazing he is very respectful and gives good deals, beautiful supplies, I only wish that I can order online instead of drive 4 hours. But it’s really the best arabic clothing store I’ve ever went to !</Text>

I drove one hour and got there at 10:30 ish. I needed 20 Hijabs to send for less privileged women. The owner was not in the store. The kind lady who was working there called the owner if he could give me discount. The owner asked me to wait 1 hour for him. I told him that I came from far and can't wait one hour, so please give the price so I can buy and leave. He replied " go, go..if you don't have time just leave my store and go" in a very harsh tone. I left and ordered from Amazon at better price.< /review>

As a new Muslim, I needed help not only developing a basic wardrobe of hijabs and accessories, but also learning how to style my new hijabs a few different ways. I was welcomed warmly and left a much more confident and stylish Muslima.

<review>Thank you  for the good service, especially the time and effort in making us  feel like royalty. I know now for sure I will always be in contact with you because definitely I will be buying from you guys again! It has been the first time for me to find such good prices for Beautiful dresses, hijabs, and much more. You are a great sales executive, may you be blessed with higher ranks. I appreciate every little thing that was done with us during  buying from you. I went there today and a lady assisted me she’s really sweet and of course uncle Ahmed Allah yarzuquk.
Your helper !
Once again thank you very much.<//review>< pictures>

I'm not Muslim, and this is my second time shopping there. The quality of the clothes is not very good, and most of them are made in China. I don't like that the lady took the clothes from me and put them outside the dressing room while I was still shopping. She did that the first I was there about a month ago, and while I was in the dressing room today, she knocked very loudly on the door, which I thought was VERY RUDE. That has NEVER happened to me before, ANYWHERE. I won't be shopping there again. I found 2 other stores after I left this one and will be shopping there from now on.<//review>

The brother even took care of the alterations to my garments right there on the spot. I recommend Al Anwar to all of my muslim brothers and sisters. I will definitely visit them again, InshaAllah.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Very good place to shop. The owner and helper both are very nice.
To my other muslim brother and sister: how dare you post such a bad comment for your brother, don't you fear Allaah?
Don't you feel pain when your comment gives him pain? May Allaah enable us to understand and practice our deen. Ameen</text>

This store is so bad, the owner is lying most of the time. Please be careful when you want to buy or deal with this bad owner (his name is: AHMED ABU MEHDY). I'm just saying the truth. Thanks< /review>

<review>We had a great experience at Capitol Ford. The service was welcoming and pleasant. Manuel Olivares did a great job showing the vehicles we were interested and Joe Davis did a great job with his customer service. We have shopped and bought cars and trucks at the Capitol Dealerships...but this was, by far, the best experience. We will definitely come back. Thank you Manuel and Joe for the great customer service and for giving us the opportunity to buy a great SUV...in the Ford Expedition.</review>< rating>

< Review>
Our experience was a great one! We walked on the lot and soon after Joseph Ortiz came out to greet us and offered to answer any questions we might have. We asked questions about different cars on the lot and he was very knowledgeable. We gave him an idea of what we were looking for (we were just browsing not going to buy) and he directed us to the car that matched our specific interests. He envisioned exactly what we would like.. We had already looked at other cars at other dealerships, however, the service and attention Joseph gave us is unmatched....he basically was the reason my wife and I decided to go ahead with the paperwork. We are happy with our purchase and the entire experience. We recommend Capitol Ford San Jose. The staff is friendly and very professional. We live an hour away but we'll go back for our next car!< /Review>

<Text>Definitely check out with Capitol Ford if you are shopping for vehicles. An agent (Jesus Ortiz) reached out to me to offer help right after I registered my online profile. He did not push me to buy at all. Instead, he actively listened to me and fully understood what I am looking for. That was why he was able to recommend the best car that fits my needs. He also worked with his team to get the best deal for me. I have to say the transaction was so smooth and way above my expectation.< /Text>< pictures>

Car buying experience at it's very best. Special shout out to Gerald Knapp & Rayn (Sales Manager) - They are extremely helpful.

From the time I sent Online enquiry till I walked out of Capitol Ford with my new Mustang, Gerald was always there to help. He did take that extra step to make sure I am happy with the car I am purchasing. He was always eager to listen to what I wanted and showed me exactly the same things! He had answers to all my questions... You are a rockstar Gerry!

Thank you Capitol Ford for the amazing Customer focused service. Without a second thought I will recommend everyone to Capitol Ford.

I hope Gerald get a thank you note from Capitol Ford for ensuring that the Customer is happy with the purchase.

My next car purchase - Whenever it is, it is definitely going to be from Ford and I hope to work with Gerry again.. soon!<//Text>

<Review>I had a great experience purchasing my new Ford Bronco Sport at Capitol Ford through Robert Green. Robert and his team made the purchase convenient and easy. I had done my research on this vehicle and knew it inside and out. Robert was the most familiar salesperson I encountered across 10 different dealerships. He was incredibly knowledgeable and professional. Most of all, the price beat every other competitor in the Bay Area. The vehicle was delivered to my house by Robert himself. He had all of the paperwork set and ready to go. It took less than 10 minutes. He gave me a comprehensive tour of the vehicle and drove back in my “trade in” vehicle. By far the easiest and most enjoyable car buying experience. Thanks Robert and Capitol Ford Crew!</Review>< username>

<Review>Has a great experience buying my new used car at Capitol Ford. The sales person, Manni, took time to help me find the right car, even though it meant to have every car disinfected after test driving it, and to stay after hours to finalize the sale because I needed the car urgently. Would go there anytime again.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>We just bought a 2021 Ford Expedition Platinum through Cody Elemen.  He was very responsive, professional and timely. After finalized fair price, he helped to get a vehicle down from Stockton on next day. Once it came in, he set up an appointment for the paper and deliver a clean vehicle to us with a full tank of gas.  He was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. He explained how everything worked, and even answered questions after delivery.  It was a great experience !!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>We had a great experience at Capitol Ford. From the beginning to the end. We didn't even intend on buying the same day, but it turned out that the car we came to test drive was perfect for us and Rick Simpson and the team at Capitol Ford made it extremely easy, and hassle-free.

I had submitted a request to test drive a specific car early in the morning, and Rick responded very quickly (by both email and SMS) to set a time for us. We went in and Rick had the car ready to go. After we determined that we were happy with the car, the buying process was very easy.

I would highly recommend considering Capitol Ford for purchasing a car, and we'll certainly go back to them in the future. Rick Simpson was excellent in guiding us through the process.

Thank you!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1611596425596, 'text': 'We appreciate the great review, Tony!'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

I just bought a 2020 Ford Fusion from Mr Cruz at Capital Ford and could not be more happy with my purchase. Gustavo Cruz at Capital Ford was a really nice man who worked really hard getting me the deal I was looking for and to get me out of a car I still was making payments on. I would recommend Mr Cruz at Capital Ford to help you get the car and payments the way you want. Thank you Gustavo Cruz for telling me over the phone to come in and you could and would help get me out of my other car even if I stilled owed.... you were right. Love my purchase and the safe and easy way you all do business through these challenging times. Thank you again!< /Review>

<review>Purchased a new Explorer from Cody Elemen who was SUPER helpful and made it a truly effortless experience. Rather than trying to sell cars, DGDG aims to help customers buy which makes for a much more pleasant and pain free experience which is exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend Capitol Ford to anyone looking for a new car. Ask for Cody and you won’t be disappointed.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

After weeks of rigorous research and popping in at this or that dealership I found myself at Capitol Ford. The product line put me in the driver's seat with a variety of options while the exceptional service from Jesus Ortiz kept my buying process on autopilot. Safe, friendly, professional. I'd recommend Mr Ortiz to anyone I know because he gets the job done right! Thanks Jesus!!!< /Text>

<Review>I just picked up my new car at Capitol Ford and am so happy. I worked with Stephen Minchell and Brian Trivett. The car I wanted (Mustang Mach E) was in short supply due to delays from Ford. But Stephen worked hard to locate the exact model/color I wanted and I got it earlier than I was expecting. Brian did a great job explaining all the ins and outs of the car, since this is my first electric car, and made me feel comfortable before driving off the lot. The whole experience, from my initial visit and test drive to signing the papers, was a great one. Would recommend Capitol Ford and the team there!</Review><user_name>Kathy Formica<//user_name><rating>5< /rating>< response>

I have never experience the care from an auto dealership like Capital Ford from the minute we walked through the door. Gerald Knapp listened to all my needs and concerns and help me get everything I wanted, the manager stepped in and made everything convenient for us, it was beyond all expectations, they treated us like family.  this is a long process and you're awesome coffee machine helped us get through it.  I will highly recommend Capital Ford, Thank You for your attentiveness.

<text>I purchased a new Mustang GT from Capital Ford and had a very smooth and pleasant experience.  Rick Simpson was my sales person and he was outstanding to work with throughout the process. Rick made email contact with me shortly after my online inquiry regarding the car.  He also made himself available on his cell phone when I had questions.  Rick and his manager, Joe Davis, worked with me to come up with a fair price for the Mustang and we closed the deal over the phone without the typical of back and forth negotiations.

I drove nearly 3 hours to the Capital Ford dealership to buy the car and it was well worth it.  When I arrived, the car was ready for me to drive off after I completed the paperwork.  I met with Finance, Amer Alazzawi, to complete the paperwork and he was very efficient and pleasant.  Amer answered all my questions regarding extended warranties, and did not pressure me to purchase a warranty (although I did).

After completing the paperwork, Rick was immediately available to take me to the car to go over some of the basics, including setting up FordPass and bluetooth connection for my cell phone.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Joe M< /username></record></dataset><record>

We were looking to buy a new Ford F-150 truck.  We looked online for a truck that would meet our requirements, found it at Capitol Ford, and 48 hours later, it arrived at our home.  It was simple, best vehicle purchase ever.  Ryan and Gerald did everything they stated they would do, could not ask for anything more. If you are looking for the right dealership to buy a new car or truck, I would recommend that you contact Capitol Ford.< /review>

I had a Great Experience purchasing my 2017 Ford Fusion Energi at Capitol Ford.  Brian Trivette went over and beyond.  Very courteous, informative and hospitable.  After I purchased the car at closing, I couldn't take my car home.  Brian stepped up and said he would deliver it for me.  Brian had the car detailed, filled up the fuel tank and delivered it himself.  Brian went over a few things with the car, congratulated me and went back to work.  I would Highly Recommend Brian to anybody looking to buy a car at Capitol Ford.

Thank you Brian!!11</Text>

I recently purchased an SUV from Capitol Ford and everybody went out their way for me from Howard, to Jessie, Stephen and Ryan.  I had a specific configuration and color in mind and they were able to find one at another dealer and bring to Capitol Ford.  Not easy at the end of the year!  I have to give a special shout out to Howard for coming in on his day off to accommodate my car pick up schedule.  Thank you very much!  My car buying experience was wonderful and I would recommend Capitol Ford to anybody.< /review>

<Text>I purchased my first Electric Vehicle, the Mustang Mach E from DGDG Capitol Ford this past Saturday April 3rd. The buying experience couldn't have been any better. My salesperson Cody Elemen had the vehicle ready and waiting for a test drive and then all documents were ready for preview. Once he went over all the bells and whistles of the new vehicle I was directed to the finance department where my my purchase and contract signing was a breeze. Thank you Cody!<//Text><GmapID>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4<//GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

I had a great experience purchasing my new 2020 Ford Edge SEL at Capitol Ford through Brian Trivett. Brian and his team made the purchase convenient and easy. I had done my research on this vehicle and knew it inside and out. Brian was the most familiar salesperson I encountered across 10 different dealerships. He was incredibly knowledgeable and professional. Most of all, the price beat every other competitor in the Bay Area. The vehicle was in excellenet almost brand new condition. He had all of the paperwork set and ready to go. It took less than 30 minutes to complete the whole purchase process. By far the easiest and most enjoyable car buying experience. Thanks Brian Trivett and Capitol Ford Crew!<//review>

My family is very disappointed with the experience we had here. We purchased a brand new 2021 Ford  F150  and with it the paint protection ($750) to make the  long story short, we were told VERY different things at the time of purchase and after the application time. At first the sales department implied that the paint protection is like a detail with the addition to protecting the longevity of the paint. At the time of pick up the truck was noticeably dirty. Water spots everywhere, dirt still caked on , and residue on the door panels. We were very disappointed with the finish product and to put the icing on top the service tech was honest and spoke up about the sales department misinforming the customer about what they purchased and that it’s happened to countless more customers. The issue I had was when I spoke to the customer service lady she was dry, rude, snobby like if our experience didn’t matter to them nothing customer orientated. There were two other employees with the same stink eye one of them being Jesse. As someone who works in emergency medical services it is our job to address concerns in a respectful manner and no I’m not using my job to act entitled I’m just saying how my experience was with capital Ford.<//text>

<Review>I purchased a brand new 2020 Ford F-150 XL 4X4 with 4 miles on it.  The initial purchase process was good.  I drove from out of the area and they had most of the paperwork ready when I arrived.  I made the purchase and before I even made it home I noticed the rear backup camera was not working and there was a small ding on the truck.  I tried to deal with the dealership with the issues, but they were impossible to deal with and would not do anything help.  Typical dealership runaround.  They just told me to take it to my local dealership to have them deal with it.  Once they get your money, they could care less about customer service.  I had to file a formal complaint with Ford Corporate and now they are trying to make the issue right.  I'm glad Ford is a reputable company that strives to maintain good customer relationships, because Capitol Ford is far from reputable.</Review></record>

We purchased a vehicle and were told we would get our contract sent via email. Never did. Why? Because the finance lady sent our contract to an email address she made up on a warranty we didn’t want. After repeated phone calls asking to please send us our contract they finally sent it to my email address, that’s when we found it it had been sent to another email address from the beginning. Have they taken responsibility for this? No. If I could I’d give negative stars for the inept service we have received. Now we have to figure out how this breach in privacy will affect us.</Text>

The left rear tire of my Ford Fusion had picked up a screw in between the first and second treads. Because the car has very low mileage for its age and I have an extended warranty that covers road hazards, I knew I should take it to the dealer. Other work was also needed, including an oil change and the 15k mile service.

It was so easy to make an appointment, and when I arrived, Michael Nolan, my service representative, explained everything in detail and provided and estimate. I'd decided to wait for the work to be done, but I needed to eat breakfast! Mike asked another man to drive me across the street and about a quarter mile away from the dealership to a restaurant.

When I returned, I waited for another hour or so, but when everything was done, it was perfect. Tire repaired, tires rotated, wheels aligned, 10k/15k services completed, crankcase & fuel injectors cleaned, and my car was washed and ready to go!

I highly recommend this dealership, its service department and all of ther staff to anyone who drives a Ford vehicle!< /Review>

I had the pleasure of working with Brian for a test drive, who was thorough in following CDC regulations, and the rest was history. Couldn't have gone better, price was upfront, everyone at the dealership was helpful and hospitable. Brian went above and beyond with informing me everything I could possibly need to know about the buying process (my first time). The team even accommodated the several speedbumps I had encountered. Awesome buying experience, strong props to Brian and everyone at Capitol Ford.</Review>< pics>

<review>We never owned a Ford before and knew nothing about this car, and also we’ve had the worst experience with another dealership before, so I would say my wife and I were a little skeptical when we arrived at the dealership yesterday. But this is definitely not the case for Ford representatives and employees!  We had a great experience and are thrilled with our new car !!!!  We are very grateful to Oscar Solis for the best customer service, fair deal and professionalism. Thanks FORD! We’re sooo happy!!!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<name>Nguyen Hoang< /name><date>1608001861116</date><Rating>4</Rating><Text>I just got a 2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid from here. The car is amazing. I love the service although there is a few things that make me take 1 star from here. Brian Trivett is a super nicest dealer man I've ever talked to. Good introduction to the hybrid car, he also helps me take care of the grant payment from Clean Car For All program (this is a awesome program that help to get rid of your old car and grant you money for a hybrid or electric car). The process is quite smooth, but I feel a little awkward when I work with Brian and his manager keeps interupting. The lady in the financial department is quite not happy to help to sign all the documents. I paid the car by cash, and she said she couldn't give me back my change out of balance because her dealership DOESN'T USUALLY take cash payment. It was almost $50 of change. Luckily I have just enough other bill for the balance that I gotta pay, it didn't really bother me eventually. However,  overall, I love the car here and the dealerman Brian, keep your working energy like this, I hope you will make a lot people happy with new cars that they will get from you.

<Review>Hello getting a car at this dealership has been the worst decision I have ever made in my life. I bought a car back on 2018. And this car has caused me so much problem. And I inquired in trading in the car and they said they wouldn’t let me and that I’m the cause of my car braking down. And they have the worst and the most rude customer service at this location. I’m close to filling Lemon law.<//Review><user_name>Fernando Valdovinos</user_name>< pics>

From the moment we drove onto the lot, Brian Trivett, our salesman was absolutely fantastic...  When we got there, it was our third stop of the day and we were not having very much success finding a truck that would fit our needs.  So we decided to stop at Capitol Ford and boy oh boy are we glad we did.  Brian was there to greet us and you know how you sometimes just want to be left alone, well Brian's presence was neither annoying or bothersome it was actually welcoming.  He is so professional and personal and took us right to his desk and pulled up some vehicles to show us that we may be interested in, instead of walking all over the lot.  SMART MOVE BRIAN!!!  So in looking at their inventory, Brian is very knowledgeable and asked the right questions to only show us what we were interested in.  Love this.  No time was wasted.  When we agreed on a truck we were very interested in, Brian went right out to the lot and pulled it up for us to test drive.  Fabulous truck.  IT was exactly what we were looking for.  We went in and started the paperwork and it was actually very easy.  Doing vehicle purchases is always time consuming but Brian Trivett was right there with us until we signed on the dotted line, instead of going to assist other customers.  The Sales Manager along with the entire staff are so personable.  The entire process was actually enjoyable and they even loved our dog Taco Belle :).    Vehicle shopping can be such a disappointment and drag but if you are really serious about purchasing a new vehicle, I would highly recommend stopping at Capitol Ford FIRST...  You will not be disappointed.

Brian and Staff, thank you again for your professionalism and personalism.

When we are in the market for another vehicle, you are our  only choice.

Paul and Gina TInoco..  Purchased a 2017 F150 with turbo on 1.25.21.  Love the truck...

Horrible.... The director of services is rude and denied the facts. They waited until my car had serious issues that put life of my family at risk. I would advise to stay away and visit any other ford in town especially for repairs. Horrible customer service.< /Text>

I can't say enough about our great experience and even with the Covid-19 protocols in place they made us feel comfortable.
We will definitely be back when this one needs 'upgrading'!< /text><GmapID>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4</GmapID>< rate>

Robert Green is a sales professional that went above and beyond for me when I drove in 5 1/2 hours away from Los Angeles to pick up a rare van I couldn't find anywhere else. If you're fortunate enough to work with him I'd imagine he'll provide the same excellent service for you!<//Review>

I've purchased 3 vehicles from this dealership over the years. My last car was in 2013.  I was not thrilled with the people and process then and wasn't likely to ever return. However, as a DGDG owned store, I figured I would at least talk to them after all they are very close to home.

I worked with Brian Trivett on the sales side. Brian was great to work with. Easy going, no hard sell. He is there to help you find the right car for you and your budget.  The sales manager was really professional and willing to work on a fair deal for both of us.  I felt like it was a win win.

Amer is finance was also a great representative. Some of my most unpleasant car buying experiences have been with finance people.  Amer was great. He did his job professionally. He explained the options such as maintenance contract and extended warranty.  Not pushy or hard sell.  No trying to push junk addons either. No one did anything shady or slimy.

The entire dealership was professional. At no time did I ever feel they were untrustworthy or was I uncomfortable.

The entire process went pretty smoothly and quickly.  Maybe 2 hours total.  That was awesome!

I will advise all car buyers to do their research and do get prices over the internet before going to the dealer.  Go to youtube and check out videos on buying a car and avoiding the pitfalls as well as unnecessary fees or addons.  Don't even think about going to dealer until you do.  Always walk out of a dealership if you are not comfortable, being pushed into a deal or a car you really do not want.

When you are prepared, Capitol Ford was great for me and hopefully for you to. Be sure to ask for Brian Trivett!<//review></record>

Within 24 hours I received a call back to gather more details and let me know they would continue to work with me to find the perfect truck. Within just a few weeks, they found the perfect match.  Price, year, miles, and features.  Just what I was looking for.  A few days later the truck was mine.

The entire buying experience was a breeze, including all the legwork for completing the financing.  To top it off, they drove my new vehicle 90 minutes to my location to drop off the truck at my convenience.

I highly recommend using Capitol Ford!  Well done.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I wish I can give more than 5 stars since Eddie H. & Mike in the Service department were outstanding and professional. Even with the pandemic, both were very pleasant to talk to and mindful of the customer's safety. I went in for a recall service for my car and both of these guys made this transaction an easy one. Thank you again, Mike for washing my car. Even with the shortage of staff, he took the liberty of washing my car prior to my arrival. Their customer service and staff were stellar! Take care Ford Team! Stay safe & well!<//review>

Recently purchased the 2020 Ford Escape Hybrid and had nothing but a great experience. Everyone at Capitol Ford was very friendly and helpful. Both Jesus and Joe were very patient, helpful, and pleasant to work with. This was my first car that I was purchasing myself and this team made me feel very comfortable and were able to find the right car to meet my needs!

Thank you Capitol Ford!<//text>

My wife wanted an White 2020 Explorer ST and Capitol Ford had one, so last night I submitted a query on their website, including some information about what I wanted, my trade-in, the incentives, financing, and a specific vehicle, using the exact VIN.

I received a generated response from Ryan, then a follow-up call in the morning from Gerry. We agreed on price, they looked up my Ford Pass ID and subtracted an additional $750 from the price, gave me a price on my trade-in after I gave them the vehicle VIN, and they offered to bring the vehicle and paperwork to my Livermore residence, drop it off, go through the paperwork for correctness and signatures, go over the car functions, operations, and details, then take my trade in back to the dealership.

Gerry arrived at 2PM and did exactly that, then drove away..

This was by far the best vehicle buying experience I have ever had in my lifetime!

And, this experience is a complete contrast in comparison to what my Wife and I endured on Sunday at Livermore Ford, then Monday at Fremont Ford.

Professional, Courteous, Respectful, and very clear communication - exactly what I want during a vehicle purchase experience.</Review>

It amazing how many loop holes are in the extended warranty. I found out I have a 1000 mile window in changing my spark plugs during my 100,000 mile warranty or they charge me for them. So irritating... then to top it off they charged me a $100.00 waste disposal fee for them! Thanks DGBG for ripping me off!<//review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Bought my 2019 Ford Fiesta from this dealership and came back for a scheduled maintenance. Armando was very helpful to inform me what exactly was included in my package. Once my car was ready, he promptly notified me right on time. The whole process from scheduling an appointment to picking up my vehicle was quick and easy. Complimentary car wash and vacuuming was also included. Definitely would recommend this dealership, whether is it to purchase a car or do maintenance!< /text>< username>

Great experience and an awesome team! Josh took great care of me ensuring I got my vehicle and even came in on his day off to deliver it to me. His manager Eric made the deal happen and earned my business for years to come. No hassles, no stress. Amazing team at Capitol Ford. Thank you gentlemen!<//Text>

<response>None</response><review>Let the buyer beware is what I would offer anyone considering purchasing a used vehicle at Capitol Ford.  I was happy with the truck I purchased and the pricing for it.  But, before I went to purchase it, I checked Kelley Blue book for the trade in value of my 2017 Tacoma  ($22k to $24K).  Stephen at Capitol Ford offered $20K to $21K which I didn't think all that fair.  But, I wasn't sure and their truck was perfect for me.  I didn't bring up the subject of the KBB trade in value being $1K to $3K higher.  I should have.  I just asked Jesus to "do the best he could with that".  In the end, I accepted the $21K as the trade in value.  And then, when I got home I got an email from another dealer who said that they would offer $22K to $24K for my Tacoma.  I'm not happy with that outcome, I don't believe that Jesus and Stephen did the best they could and it's my bad for not following the advice; buyer beware.<//review>< rating>

**Update: they are giving me the run around on a safety recall repair saying they don't know what to do after they verified my car was part of the recall. Awful.
Original: Pretty good. I wish they would give estimates on time when making the appointment<//Text>

<text>PLEASE TAKE THIS TIME TO READ THIS. You better not delete this comment either I want everyone too see it. My car was their for more than a week due to my cars power steering going out. It had gotten robbed on their site. I had after market sound speakers and bass speakers with amp installed etc etc. They busted out the right rear window and took my speakers. Nothing but crooks from the service department that looks like their working their. When I got their to look at the mess some guy from the service department looked really nervous, I’m pretty sure it was someone on the inside plotting on my car because anyone of their employees can just hop in your car and move it. It’s a coincidence that my car and another truck was broken into. my car has 5% window tint and back seats up so obviously i was targeted. So be careful when leaving your car here they are big time crooks. If anything GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN TYPE OF MODIFICATIONS ON YOUR CAR. They also said their cameras were off and not working and that they had security patrol. Yea right. They said they’ll reimburse me for the missing things but that’s not the point the point is that ain’t right for them low life’s to be doing that. They don’t get payed enough or what? I also have pictures of the car broken into. They also said that this has happened in the past. BEWARE Please look at the pics.< /text>< Pics>

It was the best car buying experience I have ever had.  I submitted an inquiry online and Jackie got back to me the very next day to answer any questions I had and to schedule a time for me to come in.  I must have called her back 5 times with questions, but she was extremely patient each time.  I ended up going in the same day to look at the car and test drive it.  When I walked in, I asked to see numbers first before test driving and they respected my wishes.  After looking at what my payment would be, I took the car for a test drive and fell in love with it.  Jackie told me not to worry that I would be leaving with the car I wanted and that is exactly what happened.  They were even able to get me a LOWER payment than what I was paying for the car I traded in.  Jorge was also very helpful and patient! Oscar worked quickly and efficiently to get me on my way. Every single person I came in contact with was extremely pleasant and caring. This dealership truly understands the value of your time.  I highly recommend checking them out for your next car!< /Review>

<Review>Went to Capitol Ford on 2/24 to test drive an expedition, mainly to rule it out as we were thinking we would end up with a different car maker.  Peter Arriage was our sales associate and did a great job explaining the features of the car, gave us tons of knowledge during the test drive and was not pushy at the end when we said we needed to test drive a few more that day.  We ended up coming back later that evening and purchasing the car with him.  Great experience overall, thank you<//Review></record>

I would highly recommend Rick Simpson  and Capitol Ford for any car purchase. I talked to Rick the night before and he came in on his day off to work with me. My purchase was flawless,  completed in a reasonable time,  and I felt comfortable with all who I came in contact while there. Five stars for sure.< /text>

For the past two months we were looking around for a new vehicle because our 2017 Ford Fusion lease was coming to an end. We decided to go back to Capitol Ford where we leased our 2017 Ford Fusion. Compared to other dealerships, this was once again one of the best experiences we’ve had. We are very happy that we chose Capitol Ford again. I want to thank Ashraf Ali for being a great product specialist and a great person. I also want to thank Eric Flores, these two individuals worked with us towards a great deal for a new 2020 Ford Fusion. We are very happy with the vehicle and the deal we got. You guys deserve more than five stars.<//Text>

My wife and I bought a CPO 2016 Ford C-Max Energi from here on 6/22/19 and we are very happy with our car buying experience.

The salesman Jose greeted us when we arrived and promptly took us to the car. Since we called ahead of time to test drive the C-Max, he had even made sure to charge it up ahead of time! He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and let us take about a 15 minute test drive, which I felt was fair since the place was busy when we got there.

Once we started the purchasing process things were fairly straight forward and they were able to beat my pre-approved interest rate.

The only reason I took off a star was because during the test drive and prepurchase inspection we noticed the car was missing floor mats. We asked if they were going to supply them a total of 5 times and they said we would get them after the car was detailed, but we never got them. We waited about 15 minutes in the car while a separate salesman went and looked for them but he said they didn't actually have them.< /Text>

<Review>Great and seamless experience returning our Ford lease and having a brand new Ford Explorer leased. Very smooth communication (thanks Peter Arriaga!!), totally adapted to the COVID situation, minimizing the visits to the dealer to the minimum (this can't be said about other dealers on the area that wanted to bring us for a face to face negotiation that we wanted to avoid) and giving us an unbeatable offer for the car we were exactly looking for. Thanks!</Review>< rate>

<text>If your in the market for buying or leasing a car Capital Ford is where to go. The customer service here is excellent, you have all around nice and courteous people who work hard to assist you in your car leasing / buying experience. Rick Simpsom (sales manager ) and Jorge Velazquez ( finance manager) whom assisted me in my journey were the best from start to finish. They answered any and all questions I had and made the process of this experience less worrisome and tedious. I couldn't have been more satisfied in going with Capital Ford to assist me in my journey. Thanks again to you both for making my experience the best.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Really horrible service. Your word means nothing to them. Have been waiting for a particular vehicle for 2 weeks. Employee's  from both Ford DGDG and Kia DGDG where saying " When the vehicle is ready we will call you for a test drive". Texted the employee every day for the 2 weeks. When the day came when it would be available the represenitive said the car "is currently being test driven" & "If we are Intreasted in another vehicle because it's looking like they are going to buy the car". Worse customer service. Constant confusion between dealers. Would not reccomend any DGDG dealer. Buyers beware. Do not reccomend business with DGDG. Very unprofessional.<//Review>

We bought our son's Mustang GT500 here and the sales experience was pretty good, but took a long time. They gave us a fair price for our trade-in and we ended up getting a competitive price for the new mustang since I was prepared with prices from other sources.
I would recommend this ford dealership to others.<//Text>

We have been going here for the 9 years to get our truck serviced. After the service they asked if we wanted our truck washed we said yes so away we went not noticing that they had taken the antenna off .We noticed after in the middle of our trip as we went to turn on our radio.
When the survey hit my mail box I told them they never contacted us to apologize so as my husband  found the antenna  in the back seat on the flood .This has never happened so I don't know who it why they did it but never a peep from them< /text>

<review>Worked with Donavan over the last few weeks all online. He helped me work on a purchase for a 2020 Explorer and trade in my lease. Everything was seamless and easy. This is the 5th car we have purchased here and overall this has been the best experience. Donavan came to our house to deliver the car , pick up the old one and complete all paperwork. I definitely prefer to purchase any of our future cars just the same. Thank you Donavan. Awesome experience!</review><userid>105877204475874812423<//userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great dealership to work with! I purchased a new 2019 Ford Fusion Hybrid from Cody Elemen over the course of a week. He was very prompt and courteous over email, and the price was very fair and below the KBB fair market pricing for the vehicle.

Going into the dealership, I was not bombarded by other salesmen or offers for extra accessories. Cody went over the different financing options, and we calculated the best way to maximize the rebates I could be eligible for. After reading through the contract together and ensuring that I understood every paragraph, he also went above and beyond and replaced the car battery, which had given us some issues on the test drive.

I am very satisfied with the honesty and straightforwardness that he presented me throughout the transaction, and would highly recommend him and this dealership to other prospective customers.< /Text>

<review>My wife and I went to the DGDG Capitol Ford Dealership to buy a used car and they refused to honor the price clearly listed on their own website for the specific car we were looking at. They updated the price to something substantially higher as soon as we walked in the door. Next they flat out denied that it was ever listed at the original price that I saw that same morning when I called. I had to go home, pull up the saved printout of the website showing the price, and escalate the issue up to the general manager just to get them to honor their own listed price.

A customer should not have to go through all this when they are trying to buy a car. A customer should not have to put up with this level of false advertising and lying, even at a car dealership.

I am not a happy DGDG car buyer and I would strongly recommend that people look elsewhere or prepare for the dealership to rip them off and lie to them repeatedly.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

I think the sales side of this establishment is ok but the service side is totally unacceptable.  My sister had her ford fusion towed on 12/19/19.  Today is 1/15/2020.  She purchased her car at this dealership and they should support her when she needs service.  Instead they lied to her and told her that they didn't work over the holidays, didn't respond to messages she left and lied to her once again when they told her they couldn't get in touch with the warranty people.  Yesterday 1/14/2020 she called and talked to the warranty company and they had never heard from Ford and said they worked 12/23, half a day on 12/24 and back to their regular schedule on 12/26 and forward.  My sister was so upset last night she had to be taken to emergency and given medication because of this mess.  Thank goodness she was able to borrow a friends car during this time.  I am wondering what the service response time is for communication with their customers but I can tell you that what she has experienced is just too darn long.  I am hearing that the Ford Fusions have issues with their transmissions so buyer beware.  She has a list of all the phone calls, the people she talked to and the information (lies) she was given.  I am contemplating a law suit against this dealership.

I have even worse stories in regards to the Ford Edge I had (I now have a Subaru) and purchased at this dealership.

Too bad I had to give 1 star...it should be none.< /Review>< Pics>

I just recently purchased a 2019 Ecoboost, Fastback Mustang and could not be happier. Cody, Jorge, and the rest of the team were excellent from start to finish. The BEST customer service I’ve ever received when buying a car - and I’m from Michigan where Fords are made. I would highly recommend this dealership, and especially Cody, to anyone who asks.</review>

<review>I purchased a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta from Capitol Ford in 2015. If I remember correctly, I dealt with a Juan Hernandez as my sales associate. While I was looking at the vehicle, I noticed an issue with the seat Juan said they would fix before selling me the car. The car was listed for about $11,300. We agreed to $11,000 flat. The associate later informed me that they had accidentaly posted the vehicle for $1000 less than they meant to. Not only did they hold up their end and sold me the car at the price we had already agreed upon, but they also followed through with the seat repair.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1578327088848, 'text': 'We appreciate the thoughtful review, Scott!'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4<//gmap_id></record>

I recently had a great experience purchasing a 2018 Ford Certified Used Expedition at Capitol Ford.  I found the vehicle on the web a mere three business days earlier and although the listing was too new for photos to be available, the dealership provided a wealth of information, e.g., Auto Check, and window sticker, that allowed me to scrutinize every feature and ultimately conclude that it was exactly what I wanted.    I also surmised that this vehicle would sell quickly because it has several features that are impossible to find in used offerings for this model.  Therefore I immediately contacted the dealership on-line and received a price quote from Donavan Jones---which was identical to the listing price.  A few correspondences later I made a test drive appointment.  In the interim, I used the wealth of data available on-line to estimate the full cost of the transaction,  then decided how I wanted to make the purchase, and finally obtained pre-approval for a loan from a local credit union that I concluded offered the best deal.

When I arrived for my appointment, I was greeted by a staff that was friendly, courteous, and professional despite it being a very busy post-holiday day.  Dino accompanied me on the test drive and thoroughly answered several technical questions that I had.  The drive went well and the vehicle met all of my expectations.  Upon return,  Dino let slip that many people were interested in the vehicle---and validated my hypothesis.  At the time I interpreted it to be an observation rather than a pressure tactic; I later learned that pressure tactics are discouraged at this dealership.  Whatever the case, it really didn't matter to me because I essentially made my decision to purchase before I stepped onto the lot and I arrived fully prepared to do so.

The actual purchase process took about 2.5 hours.  I didn't mind the wait at all because I recognized that there was a lot of paper to push and it basically went smoothly.  I was actually surprised that the whole process from test drive to having the keys in my hand could be accomplished in a few hours.  This was facilitated by the dealership's participation in the CUDL program---they even found a loan with a comparable term but better rate.

I was also presented with a lot of warranty and vehicle protection offerings.  These are tough calls because one must weigh the uncertain factors of long-term component reliability versus their potential cost to repair or replace.  For strictly mechanical components, long-term reliability is fairly well established and the odds of actually using a warranty are low.  Unfortunately, today's vehicles are becoming more like aircraft--notwithstanding Ford's aluminum bodies--in that they employ a myriad of electronic sensors and sub-systems that are less robust than mechanical components and ultimately more difficult to repair.  Consequently I opted for more warranty and protections than I would have twenty years ago.  In my opinion, the dealership could improve the experience by listing and explaining these options, their costs, and providing examples of how one could benefit from them and thus make informed choices.

All in all, I felt that the entire purchase experience was professional and fair. Given that the vehicle that I wanted was in high demand, there was no point to haggling.  Moreover, the asking price was clearly fair based on my survey of the market and third-party scoring.

Lastly, while I had really good luck in this whole endeavor, I greatly  appreciate that my evident preparation was recognized and that it contributed to getting me to the front of the line.

I wouldn't hesitate to make another purchase from this dealership in the future.  Although it could be very far in the future because I tend to keep my  vehicles for many years---I arrived in a truck that I have been driving for 26 years and the thought of parting with it is anathema.

<text>They get one extra star out of fairness due to my own complicity in this issue, but the short story is I bought a F150 from them in August of 2017, and they had lost one of the keys to my new truck (14 miles on the odometer). They assured me they were ordering a new key for me and would call me when it comes in, but that was a bold faced lie. I even asked about the key while signing the papers for the loan about what else they owed me, and Willie (the manager) assured me they were getting me the key (and I was fooled).

My main problem is they had no issue getting a hold of me when they needed follow up information on my old loan being paid off by insurance, but never followed up about the key.

Shortly after I had gotten the truck I began working out of the area so wasn't able to return for a few months, so this is where I'm giving them a 2nd star out of some fairness to them. By the time I returned to the dealership (I don't live in San Jose either so this is a drive out of my way), Willie no longer worked there, the salesman who had worked with me wasn't in, and even though I could show them emails following up about the key, the manager said too bad, it's not in your contract, we owe you nothing. We'll sell you a key though.

I obviously walked out infuriated. My new truck still only has one key, and the giant rip off that is car keys has prevented me from buying another. I am writing this still months later after I went in, but this is a warning for everyone buying a car here:

Get everything they owe you written down!!!!! They will rip you off if you don't, but I should have known that given how car dealerships operate.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I recently visited this car dealership and witnessed horrible customer service. One employee was short tempered and extremely rude. We were then helped by another worker  who had poor knowledge of Ford vehicles. Compared to the excellent service we experienced from the Carmax dealership across the street the Capitol Ford needs improvement by better customer service, and more knowledge about their cars. Overall I do not recommend purchasing or viewing a car from this specific dealership.< /Text>

Nevertheless I got a credit application denial a month later without applying for anything. Very unprofessional on the finance side! Highly unappreciated!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4< /Gmap_id>< name>

<review>My daughter bought a car here almost 2 years ago and Jesus Ortiz helped her out. My husband and I came in yesterday to checkout some cars and so happened that we got Jesus as our sales person. He's awesome and very helpful. Due to our credit, we've been turned down in the past but he was able to get us into a newer vehicle that we actually wanted with low down and affordable monthly payments. We will definitely go back and recommend anyone looking for a car, go see Jesus. Amr the finance manager was also great and friendly. Thumbs up to the Ford team even though we didn't buy a Ford, still great customer service!!! Thank you all!!!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Took my car in for service early Thursday morning. Waiting for status later that day. Texted Friday morning asking for status. Service guy texted back "when he found out something he'd let me know." He never texted me back after that. Now I have to wait until Monday to find out anything.  All they had to do is a diagnostic check ($200) for that, and then cost for any repair found. My own OBD said it is probably a faulty thermostat which failed before. I know a full diagnostic takes a while. He did tell me it may take a few days, but I'd hope he would at least respond with some status.<//Review><rate>3< /rate><UserId.>117119993753832009872< /UserId.>< Pics>

thank you for the great service from your team, especially Charlie.  From day one of buying my truck from you all he has been reliable and consistent in taking care of my truck and meeting my expectations for customer service.  Because of Charlie and his efforts I am very pleased with the service at Capitol Ford and I continue to refer other people to either shop or obtain service to your shop.  Thank you very much for the great service and many thanks to Charlie!< /Review>

First and foremost, I did not end up purchasing a car. However, I want to give a recommendation to this dealership, specifically Steve Bass. To try and be concise, I was visiting SJ from Truckee. We were here to see friends/family and attend a memorial service. My car broke down the day after I arrived and need a significant amount to fix it. Timing was terrible. Originally, I decided to just get a new car. I shopped around a few places and met Steve at Capitol Ford. Steve was SOOOOO helpful trying to find what I wanted AND in my price point. He listened and was just a joy to be around. He even waited around to ensure I got to test drive a specific car! We were going to go and talk numbers on a new car then BAM I find out that my income became far less secure and I CAN'T do a monthly payment. Steve couldn't have been more understanding and supportive. When things get more stable, I am seriously considering taking the drive 3.5 hours to work with Steve again.< /review>

<Text>I appreciate that Capitol Ford is there when I need them!  I was extremely pleased to call and hear the friendly voice of Gerry, a salesperson who helped me buy my last truck. Gerry knew who I was, and was very quick to help me get in and out and back on the road in a new truck!  Gerry, Oscar & Mike helped make the daunting task of buying a new vehicle like a breeze!  They got me in and out as fast as the paperwork would allow. No haggle. No fuss.  No stress.  I will definitely return again to buy my next truck at Capitol Ford.<//Text>< pictures>

I had the best car buying experience. I met with Thomas Glascott, I let him know my needs and wants, and he found a great car for me and my family! There was no pressure and I felt right at home. He made it so easy and fun. I highly recommend Thomas. He was very knowledgeable and made me comfortable buying my first car. Did I mention I LOVE MY NEW CAR!!!!! Thank you Thomas!!!< /text>

Best customer service I have ever had at a dealership. They worked with me on buying my older truck without even having to buy a vehicle from them.  Went back a couple months later when I was ready to purchase a new F250 and received great service again.  Helped me with finding the perfect truck that fit my needs and wants and worked to find me the best and cheapest route with financing options.  I tell everyone I know looking for a new car or truck to go there.<//review>

The entire buying experience, from finding the vehicle online, to first contact by the web sales team (Mario), to driving off the lot was smooth as silk. The gorgeous sales manager, was pleasant, friendly and... did I mention gorgeous? Mario R. and Liz C. - the dynamic duo - thanks for making the buying experience, fast, efficient, and smooth.< /text>

<Review>Had a great and easy experience. customer service oriented. They didn't take advantage of me because I was a woman on my own shopping for a car; unlike every other dealership on earth. Jesus was friendly and did not use high pressure tactics. Finally an honest salesman! Thank you Capitol Ford!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I took my car in before warranty was done, took them 2 days to tell me that everything was fine, they didn’t even look at the car they probably had it sitting in the lot the whole time, they suposably did the whole inspection and topped off fluids asoon as I lifted my hood I saw that the coolant was still low which was one of the things I made sure to check before dropping it off as a test. This dealership is trash never coming back,< /review>

I had a wonder car buying experience. Cody was very helpful in making sure that I got the best deal possible. A few days later after purchasing the vehicle I received a call from the customer relations manager Nelly about having a repair done. She was able to set an appointment that worked perfect with  my schedule. I would defiantly recommend this dealership to my friends and family.</Text>

Gerry Knapp I usually always work with.  He is very patient and always goes over everything bit by bit.  Capitol Ford altogether has been so good to me over the years.  I had a 2010 Ford Ranger I loved that they helped take care of.  I currently own a 16 Ford Fiesta and this summer I will be coming right back to this dealership and getting an F-150.  I highly recommend buying a car new or used from Capitol Ford you won't regret it.<//Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>Amazing customer service! I was stuck in San Jose because the protective covering of the underside of my car was dragging on the ground, and I had no way to get home over 17 without a functioning car. After calling and explaining my situation to the caring Alicia at the front desk, she assured me she’d do everything she could to help me out and graciously let me squeeze in a quick appointment to fix my car. At the dealership, I was greeted promptly, and then assisted by the incredibly knowledgeable and kind Zaki. He informed me that I may have driven over a speed bump too fast (whoops!) which knocked some of the screws loose on the underside covering. He assured me he would fix it in whatever way he could if he didn’t have the exact screws in stock, even if it meant a temporary measure just so I could get home safely.

The service was a lot faster than I expected, and I can’t say how thankful I am for Alicia and Zaki being able to help me get home quickly and safely. If you want to feel valued, go to this Capitol Ford dealership. Thank you, thank you!< /text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

I brought my vehicle in for some warranty repairs. The repair time could definitely be improved, but all in all everything went well. Tim Roach kept me updated, which is extremely helpful! He is the reason why I will be returning for any more work. Definitely recommend this shop to anyone! Keep it up guys!<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I just made first car buy yesterday. Oscar helped me out and Willie did the financial paperwork. It was a great experience, I never felt pressure and felt as that they were being very transparent throughout the entire process. They answered all questions I had and did not push for me to do things I didn't feel comfortable with.  I went in looking just to test drive the car I wanted and left with my first car. After doing my research, they got me the car I wanted for below invoice and I couldn't say no.

Thanks Oscar!<//Text>< pics>

Some guys here try to swindle you, but some don't. Mike is sales manager and a nice guy. You get good deals here but  do your homework before go there as they tend not to tell you enough info if you don't ask. Mike is good anyway. Giving 5 star for him but the store overall only 3 tops.< /Review>

<Review>I had the best car shopping experience at Capitol Expressway Ford. I love my new Ford Focus so much! They were professional and helpful. They listened to me and let me look at what I was interested in and did not push anything on me that I wasn't comfortable with. They treated me like I was part of the Ford Family and explained everything to me that I questions about, even if I asked a question two times. They were so caring and accommodating, that I will continue to be part of the Ford brand for many years to come. The Salesman that helped me, Howard, was very knowledgeable, personal, and professional. He does his job very well and he cares about buyers as people and not just a quota. I thank all of Capitol Ford for treating my family and I with such respect. This was the best car shopping experience ever!!! I especially liked ringing the bell when we sealed the deal to buy the car-very special, very fun!<//Review><userid>115622019573794830055<//userid>< Gmap_id>

We originally went to Ford on Stevens creek and did not have a very good experience when it came to the numbers. So we came to capitol Ford and we couldn't be happier! Both salesmen that helped us were extremely nice (shout out to Donovan and Peter!!!). I gave them a 5 out of 5 rating because of the effort they put in to find us the best fit for a car as well as their knowledge of insurance!! So thank you both for hooking it up and we are happy to be driving off the lot in a brand new Ford Escape!!!< /Text>

I was so impressed with the level of service I received from him, and Ford, I am over the moon about my purchase!  Capitol Ford takes care of its clientele, and they go the extra mile to ensure you walk away a happy customer.  On top of that, I absolutely LOVE my new Ford Explorer, it has exponentially added to the convenience of my home staging business and I say without hesitation it is the best car I've ever owned and perfect for me!

<text>The folks at Quick Lane were exceptional when I had an oil change last week.  They listened well and offered service options for down the line, but were not pushy to make a sale.

Joe arranged an ad-hoc shuttle from his crew to drop me off without me even asking.  His kind consideration saved me 2 hours sitting there waiting for the return of the regular shuttle.  I'll certainly be back!  Thank you so much!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They are always so nice when I go in. There service dept.is friendly & quiet accomadating when your having you car service. The waiting area is nice and always stocked with fresh coffee or tea. Its nice to walk in and be greeted by friendly people. I've been helped by Gerry Knapp very polite and he always very helpful and full of knowledge. I would tell my family & friends to go there for a new/used car and to have your car serviced there.</Review>

Thank you Capitol Expressway Ford for getting me such a great deal on my new Focus. Your team went out of your way to answer all my questions, and I really feel you worked to get me the car I really wanted rather than trying to force me into what you had in stock. I'm definitely going to recommend you to my friends!< /Text>

<Text>Great place to buy and service your Ford. (1 year ago)

Update: 06/11/2019

The service at this dealership has gone way down. Let me start by first saying that I just picked up my Shelby GT350 after taking it in to have the AC looked at for intermittent issues, TSB services (bumper re-alignment), regular maintenance (oil change), strange front end clunk at low speed, and the Auto Butler service. I dropped it off on a Monday. 8 days later I was told to pick up the car. 8 DAYS LATER! In between that time "Chuck" would not update me about the car unless I texted him. For me, keeping a car longer than 3 days requires DAILY status and I couldn't get that even when I requested it. The day I pick up my car (earlier today) I do the walk around to make sure everything is ok. The bumper fix looked ok, but I pop the trunk and the inside trim is in disarray. I show it to "Chuck" and he walks off and disappears. I have to talk to Sarah in his place. As I look further at my car there is bird dropping baked in stains on my hood (clearly baked into clear coat) and I point this out to them - I GARAGE MY CAR. I have never had a stain like that in the paint. I let them know how I feel, and all they can do is just say the worst things back to me instead of saying sorry and showing any sympathy. "Chuck" especially makes it worse. I am forced to take my car home and come back for the follow up service. As I drive off in the 105 degree heat the AC issue I told them to look at rears it's head and I end up driving home with no AC. When I get home there is a burning smell coming from my engine area. WOW. My worst night mare about this dealership has come true. Last time I brought my car in they damaged the front bumper. Sure they fixed it but it seems Everytime I bring in my car for service they either damage it or take way too long to service it. And it's not just on this vehicle but another Ford I own. I tried to keep positive about this place and getting my Ford serviced here but now I can't just smile and hope anymore. I think people need to know what will happen when they drop off their car here.  Heck, I gave this place a great review back in 2013 when I bought the first of many cars there, and I used to talk the dealership up and tell my friends and car clubs I am members of. Now I will tell them the truth and let them know to look elsewhere. 6 years later I can't tell you anything positive about this dealership anymore. Anyone I used to know in the service department that cared about your car doesn't work there anymore. Now I have to go through more hassle and time lost from my vehicle - it's not over yet. Still have my follow up visit so they can fix what they damaged and/or made worse on my car.< /Text><userid>100392168683046107071</userid>< Pictures>

I was in the process of terminating my current lease and was looking into leasing a slightly bigger and affordable car. I contacted Ford Capitol about a month prior to getting the car that I have now, to share my experience and what my limits were. Peter Arriaga was the one who assisted me from the very beginning and he made my process so much smoother. For one, Peter remained in communication with me from the initial time I sought support up until the day I came in to get a new lease. He answered all of my questions with patience, understanding, and transparency. He reassured me that whatever decision I made would and should be what I felt was best for me. I didn't feel intimidated or confused about my time with Capitol Ford or Peter at all. The gentlemen that assisted me were incredible welcoming and considerate of my time, level of knowledge regarding a leasing process and so on. I am extremely happy with my 2017 Ford Fusion and am truly thankful for Peter and how well and quick he was able to get me what I needed in spite of my limitations. Thank you so much!</review>

Three months ago, I changed my review from 4 stars down to 1 star.  Would like to lower it further -- and I'm not being glib or snarky when I say this!  This place has LOUSY SERVICE.  Bad enough that a scheduled appointment oil changes take >90 minutes but my last visit resulted in a damage oil filter that started leaking oil.  Had to go to a different Ford dealership to get this diagnosis -- charged me $200.   Asked Capitol Ford to reimbursement me.  They've resisted so far -- that's their prerogative, I guess -- but what is INEXCUSABLE  is that I can't get a return phone call from the "Service Director."  I've been patient and professional but over a six week this "Service Director" WILL NOT RETURN A PHONE CALL despite 10+ attempts on my part.  The rest of the staff seems equally indifferent to providing service support.   Caveat emptor!  STRONGLY advise avoiding this establishment.</Text>

<review>Be very careful with this dealership.   I wanted to buy a car from them.   I was trying to talk to the sales manager to talk about the price and they flat refused.   Literally wouldn’t talkto me!  I had test driven the car, filled Out a credit report and was approved.   My salesman asked me what other dealers I was talking to!   After my encounter I went  to another dealer and bought the exact same car!   BEWARE! Very Sketchy.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Got car service and try to use Ford Service Credit card to pay. Ford doesn't except a FORD card. Didnt have cash so they are holding my car until i can pay. This is after 2 weeks of waiting because it wasnt fixed the first time .
Had to uber home from there cause they have a “policy” that was instated by God himself, it seems. They didn't offer any help except for a discount rental. This is a  Greedy , arrogant , indifferent corp.< /Review>

<Text>The check in process seems a little slow.  Once you get someone to write up the service it is pretty quick.  But before that it is aggrevating at times.  I do not want to stand at the desk and wait for the person to finish working on the computer.  If it takes so long to do the sytem work you should have more people on the desk.  There always seems to be an abundance of people wandering around doing various things but no one helps.  They say someone will be with you soon.  Then you just wait till they get around to you.< /Text>< pictures>

My Dad always told me that I should be treated like a princess!  Well, I have to say that these guys at Capitol Ford must have been raised right...they were courteous, considerate, and quick! I practically live in my 2010 Escape, and needed repairs asap. Robert Flores not only got my car in and out in record time, but he also went out of his way to get me hooked up with Enterprise down the street where I got a sweet rental truck! I have to deal with people constantly, and I have experienced customer service ranging from non-existent to amazing. These guys rose above and beyond my expectations, which is absolutely delightful! And they even washed the car for me!! FABULOUS!!<//text>

Long story short we were looking around for a family vehicle . The staff here went out of their way to help us. How ever did not go through with it because the numbers didn't add up. 29.5k car 3.6k interest  3k tax + most how ever  outwoulf end up paying 47k at the end ... We will for sure be coming here when the time is right and I will be going to Suzette for my vehicle at that time... Steve , Mike and everyone else really twisted those own arms to help us regards to the finance ...

Instead we're going to come back with a bigger sum closer to paying half the vehicle later down the line< /review>

For my first car buying experience, it was bittersweet. My salesman David was very cordial and really worked to try to get me a vehicle that would fit my needs. Once I got in to sign the papers, my experience did not go so smoothly. I didn't feel as though the Finance Office clearly explained the options that I agreed to, and just marked places for me to sign without going into detail of what I was signing. I was not feeling good about the experience when I went home, so I called back the next day to remove the additional options and I had to go through hoops to be helped. First I was told I had to come in and sign a document, only to be told when I arrived that I didn't have to go down there, and they would remove what I requested WITHOUT signing anything. I did not trust this, considering the contract we signed said any changes would have to be in writing. I called the next day and surprise, I DID have to sign something! Whether or not any of the interactions were intentional, I did feel slightly deceived. I am very happy with my 2011 Certified Pre-Owned Ford Escape and that's the only reason why I can justify 3 Stars for an experience. However, even the state of my car wasn't ideal after the fact. The low tire pressure alarm went off within 20 minutes of driving off of the lot, and since I purchased the vehicle in August, I have to fill up my back left tire with air every week when the alarm goes off. Considering the regularity of this occurrence, I have a hard time believing that this was not known to the dealership. In hindsight, the price was too good to be true but I see this as my first car buying experience and I will learn what to look for in the future.< /Text>

This post is strictly about our salesman, Josh Schmidt... (not for the service dept who I had to leave our car with for 2 weeks trying to get them to fix all the problems I had found after buying the car. Even driving back and forth 3 times from Santa Cruz when the service manager W. said problems were fixed, but were not.) Anyway, Josh Schmidt is awesome. He literally went out of his way to help us out in every way he could. I’d definitely deal with this guy again. But, I would not take my car in for service at Capitol Ford anymore. If I need service again I will take it to the ford dealership in Santa Cruz. I bet if Josh were the service manager he would have taken care of the problems with our car properly the first time. LOL. I even asked the service manager to call me with a heads up and give me updates on my car but he never did. I had to keep calling him. Josh Schmidt was the one who was actually calling me and checking in with me to see how things were going.<//Text>

<text>Just bought a Ford Explorer this week at Capitol and had a great experience. Excellent costumer service. Donavan was the ideal salesman. Very professional and knowledgeable without being pushy. I bought the car on a rainy day and he was more then happy to let me bring it back after a few days for a proper wash. It's the little things. Highly recommend this location for your next car purchase.</text>< time>

Best customer service I've had, and these guys know their stuff, especially Jackie Yates, she has taken care of me and my friends on purchases for years, finds us exactly what we are loooking for and is more than quick on making it happen.

<review>Purchased my new vehicle at Capitol Ford and I'm really glad I made the trip down. Previous experience with other Ford dealers in the area were not great and included high pressure sales and lots of haggling to get anywhere near a deal. Everyone I dealt with at Capitol Ford was polite, understanding, and overall very accommodating. They offered the right price on both my new vehicle and my trade-in (they actually came in slightly above KBB on my trade-in with no haggling!). Overall, I'm very happy with my purchasing experience and would highly recommend anyone considering a new Ford to go and check them out!</review><gmapID>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4<//gmapID><Rate>5< /Rate><Response>None</Response><Time>1494165622255<//Time><UserId.>107462176515326216512<//UserId.>< pics>

<review>My overall experience with Capitol Ford was pretty good. The only thing that bothered me was that I had my original appointment canceled at the last minute and wasn't called back to get rescheduled when they said they would. When I was contacted eventually they apologized and let me know the guy I was dealing with had left to another dealership so I realized it was an honest mistake. When I showed up for my appointment the staff was friendly and professional. I test drive the car and purchased it that day. The whole process was relatively quick as well. I would recommend buying from this place to a family member!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Excellent customer service! I had misplaced my spare key fob, when I returned my leased electric Ford Focus. Was surprised to discover it was not covered by my extended warranty. The DGDG dealership had just taken over the site, when I signed for the lease. I was very pleased when the manager made good on the promised made by the dealership prior to DGDG and cut me a check to cover the cost of the key.<//review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>My husband and I have purchased two cars from Capitol Ford.

The first time was a F-150 with Cody.   Cody was great.  Professional and friendly; he took his time with us and made everything run smoothly.  A few days after our purchase Cody sent us a quick text to make sure everything was going well and to see if we had any questions.  I really appreciated Cody taking the time with us.

When it came time to upgrade my car we knew we would be returning to Cody.  Even though we were repeat customers Cody treated us graciously and took his time with me (I’m super picky and slow to pull the trigger haha).   Again Cody went above and beyond for us.

I would recommend Cody to anyone I knew. Thanks so much Cody for all your help!<//Review><Rate>5</Rate></record>

< Review>
Went to Capitol Expressway Ford to check out a used truck.  I was treated very nicely by Christian (salesperson), who was accommodating and courteous.  I also spoke to Terry in finance, who was equally courteous, straightforward, and professional. I also got a follow-up phone call with Nick in sales. I ended up not buying the vehicle, but it had nothing to do with the service and treatment I received at this dealership.  My experience was positive and I would recommend the sales department at this dealership.<//Review>

I found the vehicle I wanted on their website. I drove to the dealer and spent over two hours with a sales person asking several questions concerning price and rebate. I agreed to pay their advertised price which included a dealer discount and $3000.00 rebate. I was satisfied with the price as advertised.

When it came time to pay, almost $9000.00 was added onto the total plus tax license and document fees. ($5,900 for a unwanted extended warranty and no $3,000.00 rebate) After I protested they removed the unwanted extended warranty but refused to give me the advertised $3,000.00 rebate. I left with the distinct impression my experience was the norm for Capitol Ford in San Jose. If you want to be a sucker go there if not, stay away!</Text>< rating>

Capitol Ford is an amazing dealership whose customer service practices are top tier! Bought my 2018 Ford Edge Sport yesterday and it was a flawless experience. I have bought new cars before and it has been a painful process like you wouldnt believe. Capitol Ford, in particular the salesman we worked with Thomas, was so professional and wanted to make sure all my needs were met. Thank you for working with me and making the car buying experience smooth. I will recommend this dealership to friends looking for Fords. Thanks!< /Text>

I have been calling around to numerous dealerships for days and no one could get me into a car and it was urgent! I talked with Oscar Solis at about 2pm today and by 330 he called me back said " i got you approved! Can you get here by 6pm?" I almost cried!!!! I was in and out in no time and he is one of the nicest people i have met.  If you want great service "with a smile" and understanding you can get it here!!!!! THANK YOU OSCAR!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!< /Review>

Walked in to FORD knowing exactly what vehicle I wanted thanks to PETER ARRIAGA. Peter was patient to my needs and wife's numerous questions. Peter treated us as if we were family leaving me with a profound amount of satisfaction. I've driven Chevy's all my life and originally wanted a TAHOE. Peters patience and deligience had me sold on your Ford  Explorer Sport. Working law enforcement I will send all friends and family to the only dealer that in 3 months searching for a vehicle I was treated like family not a family forced into buying to meet quota. Great costumer service.</Text>

I am very pleased to share my experience with Capitol Ford. I bought my mustang a week ago and the entire process was very smooth and fast. Tommy Quach is an excellent salesman, he is very professional, customer focused and helpful. He helped me to get a fantastic deal on mustang and I would definitely recommend to go to him to buy cars/truck when going to Capitol Expressway Ford in San Jose, Ca.< /Text>

One thing you don't have to worry about with this dealership is getting harassed, they don't even call you back when you want to buy a car.

Awful experience. I didn't even go in because of what happened. I called to get an appointment to have my pick up checked, the first bad thing is I was put on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally someone picked up and the receptionist was having a  side conversation. When I explained to her my issue she stroke a couple of keys and she told me that for the type of service I needed, they only had an appointment 2 months away. Really just because my vehicle is old you can't help me sooner. She also said why don't you call around and see if one of the other dealer can help you. NO other option or anything else. Pathetic. never going there<//text>

I dropped off my Edge in for a door ajar sensor that wouldn't turn off and had been acting up while driving as well. They had it for about a week and didn't even open the door to see what was wrong with it, I received no phone calls from them to let me know what was going on until I called and ask and I finally got a hold of somebody. I decided to pick up my car and take it to Frontier Ford,which they fixed my door in 2 days. About two days later they called me claiming they had lost my keys since they assumed the car was still there so they needed my spare to copy it. I told them I had already picked up my car that it was impossible and they asked me why and I explained my reason and they said "ok bye have a nice day". I will never return there.<//Review>

<Review>Barry Teigen took very good care of me when I went in to buy a car.  He was very knowledgeable about the cars, and quite relaxed and professional.   It took me 6 weeks to get the financing I wanted, and I was never pressured.  Just a friendly "Let me know when you're ready! " type of approach.  He even brought a car over from another location for me to test drive.  Really easy, smooth transaction.  Scott Pettit, GM, has a good customer oriented culture going there.  5 stars.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Very poor experience with the service center.  Dropped off my car at 11am.  Was told to come back at 3pm, car wasn’t really.  I sat around for two hours.  Not the first time. They ended up apologizing and comped the service.  So a 1 star turned into a 4 but they should really root out the problem.</Text>

I had nothing but exceptional things to say about everyone I interacted with at this dealership.  The three gentlemen that welcomed me at the door, to the one that showed me the car, to Barry Hill that answered all my questions, and who has continued to be there time after time to answer my many questions.  I am very satisfied with my payment and customer service with this dealership and see myself purchasing all my future cars from this dealership and not from the dealership across the street.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>My husband and I were looking to purchase a SUV for our expanding family and we were lucky enough to get paired with Gerry Knapp at Capitol Ford. He was the most honest and friendly car salesman I have ever come across and we knew we were getting the best deal out there in our new 2017 Ford Edge. Thank you Gerry for making our car buying experience so great!<//review>< pictures>

Best car buying experience of all time 😃I would give ten stars but I only see five. Cody Elemen was very professional and knolagable an all around great salesman. My wife had such a great time she is thinking about changing to a FORD owner.< /text>

< Review>
The guys at Capitol Expressway Ford gave me 5 star service when looking to buy my new 2014 Ford Explorer!  They understood that I knew what I was looking for and did not pressure me at all in trying to sell me something that I did not want (unlike other dealerships I visited).  Nick and the rest of the internet sales team were very responsive and followed-up timely as promised.</Review>

Capital Ford is the place to go when you need a vechile.  They have all the latest and greatest cars on the lot and if for some reason they don't they will make sure you get it as fast as humanly possible. If you want a car salesman that knows a wide variety about all car and can make your dream car a reality then I suggest Gerry Knapp to make your dreams come true. They also have relly reliable mechanics for any repairs or maintenance your car might need. Come on by Capital Ford and make your car anyway you want and walk away a satisfied customer just like me!!< /text>

<userid>115252160909748347494<//userid><Text>I would give 0 stars if possible. Pathetic service by far, for servicing the car here. There is one person at the kiosk and everyone has to wait in line for that one person to attend to you. This should help you understand that if you’re on time to drop off your car, you will only be done dropping off the car half an hour after your appointment time. The false promises these guys make, really when asked when for how long it would take to service the car, I was told 2 hours at 1pm and when I got back at 3.45 pm, the car hadn’t even been taken in for servicing (closing time for the bloody place was at 6pm) How frustrating is that and the guy was very quick to change his words saying he was going to call me when the car was ready, whereas nothing of that sort was said when I handed the car over. Im never coming back to this place ever. My recommendation is to not get your car serviced here if you want to avoid the frustration and unpleasantness.<//Text>< Rating>

<review>Nick Kite helped me out the other day when I stopped by to look at new trucks.  Solid guy, friendly, really knew his stuff, had no problem answering all of my questions, didn't pressure me or rush me which is how I felt at other dealerships, I would recommend talking to him if you are in the market for a new or used Ford.  Thanks again Nick!< /review>< Rating>

I own a 2004 F350 and have dealt with Gerry Knapp at Capitol Ford. He helps me as a friend would, in a very professional manner. All questions get answered, problems get solved, and he is very knowledgeable about my truck and the Ford brand. I would refer anyone I know to see him for sales and help with assistance on their vehicle.< /text>

<review>We were told by one salesman to go to the back lot to see a truck we requested, but were rudely told that we were not allowed to enter the lot by a saleswoman. It was a not enjoyable, and very disgusting experience. One of the salesmen (Gerry) afterwords was very nice and helpful, but it still wasn't enough to forget about what happened before. >:(</review><date>1498723513606< /date>< resp>

My experience at Capitol Ford was a great one due to Manny in the Service department. Good customer service is hard to come by these days, and Manny does not disappoint.  Manny went above and beyond and did every single thing he said he would do. He text and kept me up-to-date on my repair and called to follow up. My car came back on time, fixed and very clean. I will definately recommend Capitol Ford to friends and family and let them know to see Manny for assistance. Thank you Manny! Your're my hero!<//text>

<Review>I had an awesome car buying experience with Thomas Halpern! He was very helpful with finding the right truck for me. He really sold me on the truck I purchased since it had alot of features that were better than the other trucks.

Before I left the dealership with my new truck, Thomas showed me a bunch of features that the truck had. First he showed me about the Ford pass app and downloaded it for me on my phone. Once he handed me the keys, he showed me how to use the Auto start feature along with all the buttons inside my truck such as: trailer assist, the 4x4 gears, all the different drive modes etc. He even progamed my Bluetooth and added my address to my GPS. Once we finished with the inside he showed me all the exterior features I had such as: keypad entry, the backup camera, back up sensors, the led lights inside the tailgate, the step assist inside the tailgate. I would definitely refer anyone that is interested in purchasing a vehicle to go through Thomas<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Waited 2.5 hrs for a oil change.  Yes it was Saturday morning but still 2.5 hrs??!!  I had the appointment as well.
Oil change was done but now I am waiting for service manager to drop off the keys to pay for the oil change.  It has been 30 mins waiting to get the keys.  This is beyond ridiculous!  This will be the last time coming to capital ford.

2nd review.  5/25/19

Went in for recall.  Adviser did not knew about the details of the recall where information was provided when appointment was made.  Told me it will take all day to look at the defective EV charger. (Which was defective 2 years ago and was told by Ford that it is not covered under warranty).  Ended up frustrated and drove out of dealership thinking how I wasted my Saturday morning.    Customer facing people should be more customer focused.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Purchased a car from a used dealer (Apex Fremont) and had problems from the start.  They were not equipped to diagnose the problem and told me I had to go to a Ford dealer.   I was upset because in the past I have never had a good experience with dealers.  That all changed with Capital Ford, they spent time with me and helped to understand the issues I was having, I ended up making an Appt. 4 weeks out!  But, it was well worth it, they were so helpful, and professional.  My rep Zaki at Capitol was amazing and he handled all of the coverage and even made sure the car rental was covered, he stayed in constant contact with me, I truly felt like a customer.  I highly highly recommend them if you have to take  your car in for service!!   I will always return here should I have any questions or problems with my car.<//text>

<Review>I just leased a beautiful Ford Fusion Energi from Capitol Ford and I can't say enough good things about this car and the dealer experience. Jacqueline and McIver did their best to give me a great deal and excellent service, that ultimately resulted in me driving away in a wonderful car!
Good dealers are hard to find, but look no further....

<Text>Jacqueline Yates helped my boyfriend and I purchase a certified, pre-owned vechile. She was extremely helpful and very energetic; made the whole experience enjoyable and simple. I would absolutely recommend her, and this company, for anyone who wants a fun, easy car buying experience.<//Text>< pictures>

Cusotmer service here is terrible. Everyone from the front desk to the service department are so quick to transfer your calls to someone else that you get a click before they even finish their sentences. They are especially terrible when you are trying to get a loaner car from them they give  the run around everytime. Though i do have to give credit to Eugenia in the service dept. She has been the only courteous and helpful service agent i have dealt with at this location.< /Review>

<Text>To make a long story short I had to take my car in for an oil change and along with the oil change I was promised a full car detail because of some shoddy work from the previous oil change.  I picked up my car yesterday afternoon and it was obvious that it had just been run through the car wash, it was full of water spots on the grill and side mirrors, the windshield was still dirty and the rear trunk area was full of dirt.  My point here is the service manger Ron Jones should not promise something to customers if they cannot deliver. Ron I just want to say that your technicians are still not resetting the oil sensors.</Text><userid>104992704029596808029</userid>< Rating>

This is a review for the service dept (not for buying a car).  In summary - poor service, expensive, and very little value for money:

a) Made an appointment on line, but I have to tell 2 people why I am there and re-explain the whole thing to them

b) I paid $150 for service on a diagnostic on a check engine light and was not satisfied with the part that they said was failing.  Rather than telling me exactly what was wrong the service rep just kept telling me it was the "valve on the motor".  For $150 that is the best you can do?

c) Car was returned un-washed - really?

d) The next day when I looked under the hood I found that the crank case ventilation hose had been left disconnected!  So they forgot to re-attach that.  They also seem to have lost a fastener for the engine cover, but I found that sitting at the base of the windshield?  Ford - quality is Job #1?  Not at this place!</Review>

<text>Never again will i buy a car from this ford! Took more than a week to get my buying contract after demanding for it! Some new thing they do by emailing you your contract instead of giving you papers after purchased. I called several times and was told that i would get a call back, no responses. I had to call and demand for this to get done.
No professionalism what so ever, not even a business card was given to us after our purchase. Thought that was highly rude and not professional. I wasnt going to ask for one knowing i was not going to buy here again. I am a business owner so i can honestly say this place is bad business and seems like they are there for only the commission. Not good, very poor customer care and customer service. No follow up calls asking how we like the car not one cent of care that we even bought the car. After finally getting the email of my contract (Oscar said he supposedly sent after purchase, was a lie also) the finance guy (Oscar) tried to make it right and asked if we wanted gas, car wash etc. For all his bad doings. We passed and explained that you can't change the way you missed treated us as customers, sadly he is just unprofessional. You see as a business owner I I stay professional at all times, there is no room for error. In a professional place as a dealer you must also stay professional at all times and have no room for error. You are dealing with ranges of low wealth, mid-wealth, high-wealth individuals seeking to buy a car  and must maintain a equal customer care deliverance. You can not be filtering individuals who walk in a car dealership looking to buy and drop your professionalism. This is what I observed waiting the 2 hours while purchasing my vechile at this ford dealership. Young, unprofessional, and out of sequence. The over look to this place needs to open his/her eyes. Very unsatisfied customer.</text>< gmap_id>

Custom ordered and new truck. These guys put 7.5 miles on it before I picked it up saying "we let someone else test drive it"!!! Finances was sexist and condescending with my wife, parts department ordered wrong parts for me from lack of knowledge of vehicle and left outside after voice mail "pick your parts up before someone runs off with them..." service department is snappy rude and slow as snails, and general manager refuses to return my calls and voicemail....still waiting on his call back, but be one hell of a golf trip... I WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING WITH THIS "DEALER" OR DGDG AGAIN.< /review>

<review>Since this is a DGDG dealer, you're pretty much guaranteed to not pay more than KBB market value for your vehicle, which is nice. What bothers me about Capitol Ford is that I've been here to purchase 2 cars and both times even after we agreed on a price it took them hours just to get us in to see the financing manager. Pack a snack if you're shopping here.</review>< Date>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>My salesperson Donavan was very very helpful throughout my hunt for a new car (which was several months long). He was patient and answered all my questions and showed me several cars.
He was neither pushy nor concerned that I might not be buying a car from him after all.

Donavan's unconditional availability was what won me over even though I was getting lower price elsewhere.
He was available 24/7 on phone/email as well as in person and made sure my order was filled properly with the correct order priority etc.

He was also respectful of the hard limit I set for my car (which was a special order). He honored his and my word when the car arrived 2 months later. If he had backtracked even for a second, the deal would be off but he honored his word which is rare to see these days.

I will surely recommend him to my friends and will definitely head straight to him if I buy/lease another car.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Instead of just replacing the ignition switch, they decided to try and get the key out. When they could not get the key out, they replaced the switch and charged us for playing around with it first, then doing what they should have done in the first place. The original quote was for $315 and the final repair was over $725... Their service it deplorable.

<text>This is one of the worst dealers I have every dealt with. I went there with a battery issue on my 2 year old car. They saw that it had issue but would not change the battery in warranty because it did not meet some numbers. I took the car for inspection since it gave trouble starting and would not look at it for more than a month in future. I tried to return my lease and would not take it since they did not have space for 1 extra car. Going there has always been like hitting a wall. And then they also want to try and sell me one. How about improve your service a bit! Horrible.<//text><Response>{'time': 1526658964581, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear about your experience, Yusuf.

The service department is TERRIBLE!. My car waited a week just to be seen. The price I got for the repair was about 50% more than another Ford dealer, and for an issue that I didn't even report. Oh... and now the original problem I brought it in for is still happening, and they can't get the car in for another 3 months??? how's that even possible?
Stay away from this poor excuse of a Service department</text>

I went to Capitol Expressway Ford to look for a truck (Raptor). They didn't have any in stock, but the person who helped me out was very helpful and explained everything about the process, and felt no pressure to purchase NOW. They were ok with my visit just for information. Very helpful and considerate. Thank you Nick Wilson and Raul Villamil.</text>

<text>Lost faith in this dealership service..I used to have high hopes & loved their service, even bought a car from them, that’s how much I was into them..but on my last two visits for both my cars was really unprofessional and poor. Main problem was On 6/21/18 for my Ford Fusion
I payed over 500 for a mile package service and this week it overheated on me, I checked the paperwork and says they checked the cooling system and passed
But the worst was I requested a drive belt replacement.. just today when I popped the hood to check what’s going on with the coolant, I see that the long ratchet is still attached to the engine belt screw.. sm*h. Someone needs to supervise before they turn the car over to owner.
Yet I bet they’re  going  want me to take it in and have me pay more for work that was done extremely poor. Why go to the service dept if their going to do a sorry job and in the end your going to be left stranded and waste a chunk out of your wallet. There’s no need to take your vehicle here if you have to check it yourself To see if the work is done right.
now I’m scared for upcoming schedule service
For sure I’m getting the automated response everyone else gets.</text></record></dataset><record>

I Can say I was lucky to have all 3 expectations met when a sales rep named Jorge Velasquez  took care of them, he put all cards on the table and worked them out for the best ending, on your next visit to  capitol ford or DGDG make sure to consult this guy and his team for a stressless purchase.<//Review>< pictures>

5 Star Experience - Customer Service was on point!

This past week I traded-in my old vehicle and purchased a new 2013 Ford Fusion. From the first time of stepping foot into the dealership I have had nothing but great experiences. This is now my second vehicle purchased from Capitol Expressway Ford and once again I had a smooth, transparent, and easy transaction.

I want to give a special thanks to the Manager, Rick Martinez, for taking care of me through the process as well as the knowledgeable salesman, Daniel Pham. I was very impressed by the professionalism of these two men and I definitely recommend that you see them personally if you need anything. They delivered on everything that they said they would do and no games were played during this purchase, nor my first  purchase.

What also made this a 5 STAR experience was the customer service. The next morning after the purchase of my vehicle, I received a call from Capitol Expressway Ford asking me how I was doing and if I was content with my purchase...content doesn't even begin to explain it, I am ecstatic with my new Fusion! Just the fact that they gave me a call to check in to see how things were doing made me happy that I went with them. Now, I was very happy from just that one phone call, but then they went above and beyond, UPS knocked on my door the next morning and that's when I was handed a package from Capitol Expressway Ford. The package was a nice little surprise of chocolate covered strawberries from the dealership! The only thing that they could've done better was if they delivered me a strawberry shortcake (that's my favorite). Regardless, I highly recommend this dealership for their professionalism and customer care.

P.S. I accidentaly left my wallet and passport in my vehicle that I traded-in and I didn't even realize it because I was so excited with my new fusion. After getting halfway home (I live a few hours away) I realized I left my wallet and passport in the car. I then called up the dealership and explained the situation. They then overnight shipped the wallet and passport to me that day! THANK YOU! 5 STAR WORTHY</Text>

<Text>Do not buy the optional "Auto Buttler" service. Waist of money! You'll end up waisting time as the service is always booked out for months and will never line up with any scheduled maintenance. I've been try to line up oil change and the Auto Buttler on the same day, no chance. You will end up having bring the car in separately.< /Text><name>Daniel Whitworth< /name>< user_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>The only reason I rate this place with 1 star is because Tommy got the car I seen delivered from vallejo to there store other then that this place is not good. I test drove a white 2017 Kia forte with Cody. It was smooth until we pulled in the car began to shake. So I asked why is it shaking? Cody said it could of been due to when they pressure washer the engine water got inside the engine. So he said for me to go and sit in his office while he "took it to the mechanic" he didn't. He just went by the car wait and came back in and said the mechanic said water must of gone in the engine.  Okay? So I waited. We took it for a test drive and it drove fine. He then said if something's wrong you have warranty. If there's an issue with the car there not aloud to sell it off the lot until it's resolved. Also why would I want to buy a car I'm not comfortable with because there's something wrong with it. So another guy came and tried to set up the payments and get them lowered to my amount. He couldn't so I said no I can't do it. Then he kept showing me cars I didn't want and that I know aren't good cars. So he left and another guy comes and says let me call a credit union and see if we can get it to your monthly payments you want.  He went to his desk and all 3 guys are talking not song anything. So I asked Cody again what was the problem with the car he said water could of got in the engine or touched the spark plugs.  Hmmm. So I made a phone call and was told not to buy it because there's something wrong with the car there not telling me. Also while looking at the car fax during the 5 days the car was not for sell it had a 40 mile difference and I asked why is that and he couldn't tell me why. So I left the place. Ended up going some where else and bought a 2015 Kia forte for a great deal!</Review>< pics>

<Time>1336957002220</Time><Text>I purchased my 2008 Ford Mustang Roush from Patrick Connelly at Capitol Ford a few months ago. I knew the price they had was already pretty good, and this was not a car you find to often but I gave them my price (which was well under their asking price) and they met it! the deal was pain free, and I was in and out in a hour. Patrick is a great honest guy and never acted like the typical "car salesmen" that we all know. Terry in finance finished up my deal and was a great honest man as well. I could of not asked for a better car buying experience. I will defiantly be going back to Capitol Ford in the future!< /Text></record>

Friendly staff, but every time I'm schedule for a service they're never on time, they last even more than 1-2hrs from the agreed time, and on top of that the cleaning of the car in every service is not good at all..... ●○ 1 year later of my first review and my experience is everytime worse, today I dropped off my Explorer for autobutler @8:30am, it was supposed to be ready @11:30am because I NEED TO PICK UP MY KID @SCHOOL @1pm and asked them ahead of time if we were going to be on time, they affirmed YES (my truck was ready @12:30) when I complained all they said was sorry. What do I do with your apology each time?... I don't see the time my contract service is done so I can go somewhere else, tired of you Capitol Ford.< /Text>

<Review>The salesman was so rude it was hilarious - but only in retrospect. He didn't even attempt to offer his card, so we won't feel bad about buying elsewhere.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I don't have one redeeming thing to say about my experience there and that's
saying a lot coming from a person who sees the positive in almost every
situation.

* Our salesperson was not very personable.

* He did not acknowledge or introduce himself to our children once throughout
the whole 5 hour visit.

* On the test drive he sat in the front seat and I had to ask him if I could sit there
for the test drive. In my opinion, he should have offered me the front seat out of
courtesy.

* He did not lift the middle row seat to help the children into the 3rd row; I did that
(remember, he is seated in the middle row).

* After the test drive, he got out and shut the door and I had to go open the same
door and lift the middle row seat to allow the children to get out of the car
(remember, he was seated in the middle row).

* My husband called the finance department several times (7 or 8 times) and left
messages over a 2 day period until finally someone called him back.

* Our final financing price was $2000 more than we had agreed on. When we
asked why, our financing specialist never offered any explanation; he just
turned the computer screen towards us. We had to read through each itemized
section to find the "hidden extras": Gap insurance, GPS theft tracker insurance,
and some other insurance. He "claims" that the salesperson was supposed to
discuss those options with us. I have found other reviewers who have
mentioned this same dishonesty.

* The car we wanted was at another dealership. We were told it would take 3-5
days to get the car. On the 5th day we called, several times before we finally got
to speak to someone, to find out when we could pick up our car. We were told
that the other dealership was still waiting on a potential buyer. WHAT??? Why
weren't we informed of this? No one bothered to let us know? We had money
down and all the papers signed for almost a week. They sold the car to
someone else the day we were supposed to receive delivery.

* I have discussed this experience with friends and family. Surprisingly, one
person had the same thing happen to her at another Ford dealership where
she filled out paperwork and finalized the deal and then the other dealership
sold the car to someone else. Another person had terrible customer service at
a Ford dealership in Florida and left without buying a car. I have always owned
a Ford in my 26 years of owning cars. Based on my experience with Capitol
Expressway Ford and the other experiences from my friends and family who
have dealt with other Ford dealerships, I have decided that it is time for me to
look at other manufacturers other than Ford.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>On 3/23/14, I decided that I wanted to purchase at a dealership where I previously had great service and great sales rep's.  I wanted a new truck this time so I went to where I purchased a 2008 GT500KR Anniversary Edition.

From my experience I was treated with all 5 Stars!!!  I can't say how easy it was to buy vehicles without all the haggling and waiting cause I hate wasting time or even being at a dealership for a day and to come out with nothing.  To my surprise my wife and I got two vehicles in one day with two trade-ins.  I got my 2014 SVT Special Edition Raptor and she got her 2014 XLT Explorer.  My wife was so happy with the customer service and friendly family type of environment, and the fact that she didn’t think we could get two vehicles at a great price!

I can't say how much of a great feeling it was to go to a dealership that values your time and interest.  They knew what I wanted and worked on the price without hassle.  I even got great prices for my trade-ins and some rebates I wasn’t even aware of.  I am a lifelong customer now and stand by this dealership…!!!!

Thanks to all the staff - Declan Hannah (Service), Howard Robertson (Sales Rep), Adrian Madrigal (Finance Manager), and especially Rick Martinez (General Manager).</text>< Response>

Good Experience, Nick Wilson assisted us with the purchase. Even though, we ended up not purchasing the car today, we did not feel pressured at any time. I will be back in the near future when I am ready to buy.</review>

Almost bought a car. Sale person agreed to sell at a price. Messaged me back a few minutes later after he said he would do it that the manager said no...it was a $648 difference. They could have sold the car without even needing to have photo and web team spend time and money posting it online. Kind of disappointed but its a popular car and easy to find cheaper deals. I was willing to pay the extra for the exact one I wanted.

Gerald came back after talking to the GSM who overroad the call mentioned above by the used car manager. A+++ to Gerald and sticking to that.</Text>

Just bought a new C-MAX Energi here. I've bought other new cars from other dealers and was prepared to have a so-so experience.  To my surprise, this was not the case!  My salesman, Saidu Sulaiman, greeted me from the start and worked with me productively through the whole process.  (Which included more interaction as the car I wanted was just becoming available in CA.)  They are nearly the last dealer down Capital Expressway strip but the little extra mileage has been well worth it to me.<//Review>

Once again, Quicklane changes Sunday hours and does not update the website, Google or any other informational portal.

Just wasted over an hour sitting in front of a locked gate with no posted hours on it.

Not good for a long time customer to be slapped in the face with bad status from a dealer.</Review>

Backstory, when I bought the car it had to be reprogrammed because the previous owners didn't supply it, the DGDG dealership I purchased my Escape from didn't want to pay for it to be done, DGDG Capitol Ford was more than happy to do it for me though...fast forward probably about 3 years and I have no idea how, but I totally spaced on my entry code! Couldn't remember it for the life of me...of course this happens on a Sunday evening at 7:30 when my phone is at 10% and dying quickly! So I had no choice but to pay and get it unlocked (bummer)...however I called today and Ron Jones was so nice and understanding and more than willing to help me out! I'm so thankful to the human who put this code on file as well, because my understanding is that this doesn't happen all the time! Ron Jones...you are the real MVP & I can't thank you enough for helping me this morning!!!

A big huge thank you to Capitol Ford for helping me retrieve my entry code! It wasn't with my vehicle when it was originally bought in January from a different DGDG dealership. I spoke with a man named Eddie (who works with DGDG, but not with the Ford dealership specifically) and he put me in touch with Robert Flores. Went in today for my appointment and met with Zaki who was friendly, professional and so helpful! I couldn't believe that when I bought my vehicle the keyless code didn't come with the car, and to top it off the dealership that I purchased the car from didn't want to help me retrieve it! A friend then put me in touch with Eddie and the rest of my experience was AMAZING! They just made everything so easy for me! Thank you again to DGDG Capitol Ford!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>We went there to buy an F250 Super Duty to tow our new travel trailer we were buying that day.  Asked our sales person what he'd offer for the truck if it was him.  We said ok that's what we'll offer.  We had to leave to make an appointment with the RV dealership.  The salesperson asked us to put a deposit down so he could take the truck off the lot and hold it for us.  Ok done.

Go to our appointment and finish buying our brand new trailer.  On our way back to Capitol Ford I get a call from the salesman.  He says he had to let other people test drive the truck and we're lucky we put a down payment on it.  I ask him "but wait, you told me our deposit took the truck off the lot and parked in the back."  He says well it was in the paper so we had to show it.  That's a bunch of BS!  But we still go back to finish making our deal.

While we are sitting there waiting for our sales man to come back with their counter offer, we hear a loud bell being rung by other customers.  We figured ok cool they just bought a vehicle.  A few more minutes go by and our salesman comes back and says "so sorry for the wait, there's a lot of commotion going on."  I ask what the commotion was.  He says "Did you here that bell?  Another salesman was selling the truck to another couple.  But I got it straightened out."  I reminded him he told me that our deposit was supposed to take the truck off the lot and parked in the back.  I asked my wife if I heard something wrong.  Well I didn't.  He says well the deposit only guarantees you first chance to buy.  Such crap!

So a few more minutes later the salesman comes back with their counter offer.  It's for full asking price and $6000 less for my trade in that I said we wanted.  WTF!!!  I ask what about our offer price...you know the one he suggested in the first place.  He says "oh sorry we have a full offer already from the people that rang the bell."

That's some very shady business if you ask me.  We were ready to pay cash for the truck at full price!  I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM CAPITAL EXPRESSWAY FORD!!  I suggest you don't either!

We walked out after this mess and will be happy spending more money elsewhere!< /review>< response>

I had already been out of the car  once asking for assistance. I left unhappy, and will be going to a different Ford dealer to get my Escape serviced.</review>< pics>

Did research for a while and Cheris Armendariz reached out to me to answer any questions I had... we communicated for 2 weeks prior.  She was so supportive answering all my questions, giving me advise as to which direction to go with for my lifestyle (Expedition or Edge).. I finally made an appointment yesterday at 4.  She took so much time to make sure I was choosing the one I really wanted! Her patience was excellent! Needless to say, she stayed until way past her clock out time to make sure she saw me take off in my brand new 2017 Ford Edge! I highly recommend you go to see her and the team!

The customer service was great. Donavan, was very helpful and extremely easy to work with. He helped me understand all my options, listened to excactly what I was looking for, and was able to get the excact car I wanted. I would definetly recommend Captiol Ford. From sales floor to financing, to Managment everyone was professional, extremely helpful, with excellent customer service. Thanks again to Donavan who made my buying experience easy, enjoyable, and never stoped  providing excellent customer service to ensure I got exactly what I was looking for. All around a great dealership to choose when shopping for your vehicle.</Review>

I'm so lucky I had ford in my life the ford on Capitol has such a comfortable system. My salesman Donavan knew his stuff and if he didn't have the answer he did his homework and gave me the most accurate answer I could ask for very quickly. 6 months ago I purchased a Nissan in my city and I literally was taken advantage of and was charged $15k more then the car was worth. Donavan saved me by putting me in a lease for 4 years. In the end I still got a beautiful fusion that's sporty and fast and economically friendly. I don't mind keeping my lease for ford because o know aster this in gonna stick with ford for a loooong time. Thank you ford and Donavan for saving my money my credit and giving me back some dignity. Kudos to this guy. I highly recommend him and have already to a couple of friends. Best of luck in your sales future my friend.</review>

<Review>My experience at Capitol Ford was definitely 5-star worthy.  Very well run dealership with knowledgable and friendly staff that really puts customers first.  But the main reason my experience was so great?  My sales professional – Tommy Quach.  Tommy went way out of his way to ensure that my car buying experience was absolutely first-class.  He was knowledgable about every model I inquired about, earned my trust by making honest and insightful suggestions, got me an amazing deal, and made sure I got exactly what I wanted.  And even after the sale, Tommy continued to follow up to ensure I was happy with the purchase, and to see if he could answer any questions for me.  If you’re looking into buying a Ford Vehicle, go to Capitol Ford, and go see Tommy Quach.  You’ll be glad you did!< /Review><time>1454659563913< /time>< rate>

< Review>
I had applied online and the internet finance person asked me to fill out the application online. He had approved my application and even accepted my trade in. He asked me to come in later that evening but I had a pre-arrangement so went there during the day. The guy was out and so other salesperson started helping me. I was told that the finance cannot be approved due to some late payment. I call the internet finance person and he doesn't know who is looking into it and can't do anything until he comes in later that evening. I said I will wait. He texts me back at 5.30 pm that his manager told him Finance cannot be approved. I texted him back how they wasted by time. He replies back that it's not their fault that I am not paying my bills. That was really unprofessional of him. They should know what they are doing from the beginning. Not telling the customer they approved and later say they are not. Not everyone has things going perfect for them but they should not be told off like that.<//Review>

I should have heeded the bad reviews I found online and skipped my trip to Capitol Ford.  All I really need a dealership for is to allow me to test drive the car and tell me price they are asking for the product.  This is how my afternoon went at Capitol Ford:
-	Arrived at 11:00.  Getting in and out of this dealership is absurd
-	Quickly greeted by a salesman and tell him what I’m looking for so he grabs keys to testdrive
-	Test drive goes great, vehicle is great.  They don’t have the package I want in the color I want but that’s not terribly important as I wasn’t desperate to leave with a new car today
-	12:00 get back to salesman’s desk to start to discuss prices
-	Salesman has difficult time navigating his computer which drags things out
-	Salesman asks for keys to my car that I’ll trade in to check VIN and mileage.  Doesn’t return my keys
-	I ask for pricing for reference on both buying and leasing. Salesman asks for me to fill out several pages of paperwork to run pricing numbers
-	After this we are basically held hostage for nearly 2 hours.  The salesman would leave and come back periodically with bits of information yet never the info I requested.  He brought back my credit score (816 by the way).  He then goes on to tell me that the lease interest for me would be 5.5% and that’s pretty high for a lease so they aren’t going to do the breakdown because it wouldn’t make sense for me to lease the car………EXCUSE ME I think that’s still my decision.
-	Now it’s 1:00.  My pregnant wife is starting to get nauseous and needs to eat.  I tell the salesman we need to get going.  He tells me that the sales manager has taken my car out for a drive to inspect it for the trade in value.  Now I’m mad.  They didn’t ask to take the car out.  It would have been ok if they asked, but to assume just to take off with my car really got my blood boiling.  So now we are stuck without a car, and a sick wife
-	1:20 I’m searching for management.  Tell them I need my keys. They say it’ll just be a few more minutes
-	1:30 still nothing, I’m furious.  I tell them I need to leave IMMEDIATELY and I don’t care about the numbers anymore
-	1:45 I go out in the parking lot to see if my car is back.  Sure enough it is.  As I walk back in, the salesman is back talking to my wife with the numbers finally.  I’m pushing him along as he tries to explain the number with a 4.99% financing interest rate.  I ask him for me keys again…”oh the manager hasn’t brought them back yet???  What do you think about the numbers?”.  I tell them they are higher than I expected and I want to leave immediately.
-	1:48 the manager comes to me with the keys and starts talking to my wife like she doesn’t speak English.  She is telling my wife to bring in paperwork for Ford X-Plan.  My wife says “ok”.  The manager says “no you need to bring in this paperwork”.  My wife says OK.  Manager looks confused and says the salesman told her we were confused about the numbers…..NO I told him the numbers looked higher than what I wanted to pay.
-	We explain we have to leave we’ve been waiting for almost 2 hours and need to eat.  The lady tries to defend herself saying they have to check my car out and that we hadn’t been waiting there for 2 hours.  My wife and I saw this lady walking around the showroom since at least 1:30, maybe earlier, when I first asked for my keys and DON’T question a customer who has been watching the clock as I describe it in the review….
-	Lastly I’m confused about a lease rate of 5.5% which is “high and wouldn’t make sense for me to choose”….yet they are giving me a 4.99% rate to finance the whole amount.  I’m guessing they were hoping I’d have enough money just to go ahead and buy the vehicle…not really sure
-	This was my first stop in searching for a new vehicle which I will need within the next 2-3 months.  I may still get a Ford but I absolutely WILL NOT get it from Capitol Ford and my wife will not be bringing her car in here for service again either out of principle<//review>

<text>I went to Capitol Expressway Ford looking to purchase my first car. From friends and family I heard that purchasing a car is a very difficult and stressful process. I entered Ford nervous and expecting to be pushed into a purchase, but that was not the case at all. Sal Castro helped me find exactly what I was looking for. He was geuninely sincere and answered all my questions and concerns. He made me feel comfortable throughtout the whole process and I couldn't be any happier with my new Ford Flex. If you are looking to buy a new car im recommend you visit Sal Castro at Capitol Expressway Ford for the best service.< /text>< resp>

Started out well, but fell apart quickly after the dealership had my vehicle for over A MONTH!  I heard various stories about the status/needs of the car and they even called me with information about another person's vehicle.  Within a week they notified me that they knew the issues, had diagnosed the problem and would order parts.  At week 3 I was told parts were still back East and were to ship that Tuesday and I was guaranteed a spot in the transmission bay.  At week 5 I'm calling for status and am told they hadn't even evaluated the car yet.  Then I get a return message saying they had the part and would "hopefully" get it into a spot next week.  What's the real story and when will I get the car fixed & returned???  Still waiting for that part of the story!<//Text>

<review>We just bought a new Fusion Energi from Capitol Ford, It truly was the best experience I have had buying a new car Howard the sales person was professional, knowledgeable and very helpful. I have had terrible experiences buying cars before in fact that very day at Frontier Ford they tried to charge us high interest and lied more than once. But that is not what we experienced at Capiol Ford these guys were great!!! Walter in the finance department was honest and upfront very easy to deal with, Howard and Walter helped us get everything we wanted and was extremely fair. Rich in the finance department gave us a great deal on the maintenance package for the car I drive a lot and it is well worth it. I have always serviced my Fords at Capitol Ford Gary in the service department has always taken great care of us and is the only place I would bring my Ford car or truck to be serviced. I'm sorry I do not remember the name of the girl who explained the new Fusion in great detail to us, her attention to detail was perfect and really helped with knowing how to use all of the Awesome features of the car. She truly spent  a lot of time and gave us the attention we needed to learn about our new car. In all this was the greatest experience I have ever had buying a new car. My wife and I love our new car and would DEFINATLY RECOMMEND CAPITOL FORD AS THE ONLY PLACE TO BUY YOUR NEW FORD. These guys are great, and the car is fantastic, anyone looking for a new hybrid electric car THE FORD FUSION ENERGI IS THE BEST CHOICE.

The lowest I cold go is one star, wist I could go less. I don't see how they get five star. I understand that this is not Lexus or Mercedes showroom but being professional is part of a customer service. The showroom is like a college break room. Workers were loud watching football all around me. I couldn't get comfortable while I waited for 2 hrs just to get to financing. Now for the car, I bought  a 2011 Altima. The maintenance light and traction control light came on when I started the car. They said they would fix it no problem, minor thing. I bought  the car (my fault ). Next day car won't run. They had to tow it back. Now I have to wait an hour just to get back to financing to get my money back. I learned my lesson.  If the showroom is as unprofessional then the service department is also unprofessional and if the management allows that type of work environment then the management is unprofessional and if DCDG runs a business like this then I will take my money somewhere else. All of this could be avoided if service department did their tune up and and inspection like they said (120 points safety inspection ). Well I know thats a lied. If any sales person started the car they would see the  maintenance lights. Remember you and I will be spending tens of thousands of dollars to an investment on a vehicle that will deappreciate right when you sign your name. Capitol Ford acted irresponsibly in their customers service from management on down. I will spend my hard earned money somewhere else. Customers will have the final say. Just a few years ago a lot of big and small went out of business.< /text>

BUYER BEWARE!!!! YOU MAY NOT BE GETTING WHAT YOU THINK YOU PURCHASED!

In 2008 I purchased a 2007 Taurus with an extended service plan (ESP=$1840.00). I was told at the time of purchase that the 5yr ESP plan would cover my car bumper to bumper for 60 months or 60,000 miles whichever came first.

4yrs later the starter goes out. I called my local dealer and was told this would be something that should be covered under the ESP plan. I took my car to the local dealer who informed me that my ESP plan expired in 2011 only 3yrs after I purchased my car. I showed them my paperwork which showed that I had purchased the contract in 2008. After the local dealer made some phone calls he informed me that my contract was a new car contract and the contract start date goes back to the original purchase date of the original owner who purchased the car in 2006 and thats why it expired in 2011. Again I should him my paperwork with the 2008 purchase date and again was told that my plan had expired,.
My only option was to go back to the dealer who sold me the car (Capitol Expressway Ford). I contacted their finance department several times before I got to talk to someone (I left 3 messages no one called me back) and was told the same thing plan went back to orginal purchase date. I asked them why this was not disclosed to me at the time of purchase and the response I got was that I should have been told at time of purchase and that he (the finance person) always tells customers when this is the case. Again I told him that this information was not disclosed to me and that their representative mislead me into believing I was purchasing a 5yr contract from my purchase date when in reality it was only  3yr contract. Basically I had no recourse.
I suggested to him that they make things right by paying for the repair ($283.00) minus the $100.00 ded. and going forward from here I know that I don't have the coverage. He said he would check with the man in charge and call me back.

Half an hour later he called me back and informed me that they would not pay for anything, but they have a customer that is looking for 2007 Taurus' and they would pay me top dollar for my car and set me up with a new car that I could purchase a new ESP plan that would actually last 5yrs.
Bottom line ther was no disclosure of this information at the time of purchase I the consumer was left paying the bill for something that should have been covered. The only thing they wanted to do to ??help?? me was sell me another car.
I would not recommend this dealer to my worst enemy.

<Gmap_id>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4<//Gmap_id><text>Summary:  test driving was easy: when we chose a car, we were passed to 4 different salesmen (who did not communicate with each other) who flat-out lied to us.

UPDATE: Ford has followed up with us after this and has been very apologetic.  I hope that in the future they learn that communication between salespeople and customers is important.

- 1st Test drive only = good. Carl was nice.
- Tried to follow up with Carl via email and phone, but he could not be contacted.
- Start talking to sales guy #2 Matt via email.  Matt crunches some good numbers.
2 weeks later, return for a 2nd test drive and get our trade-in appraised.  Email Matt to let him know we are coming.
-When we get there, Matt says that Carl will be working with us again. OK... catch him up w/ the details.
-Test drive #2 = good.  Carl doesn't pressure us to get the car we don't want.
-Time to talk numbers. Carl does not want to honor any of Matt's numbers.
-While we wait we go back out to the car.  Carl sends salesguy #3, because he had another customer.  (Hmmm. aren't WE a customer right now??)
-#3 (Tony?) is comically/annoyingly trying all the pressure techniques he can; fast talker, waiving a flyer around, nodding his head way too much.
-Go inside. #1 and #2 unavailable. All we ask for is to honor the email price or compromise, but #3 will say nothing and starts getting (fake) defensive that my husband is yelling and is mad at him (husband was very calm).
-Sales guy #3 tries to have my husband fill out a form for the same information he's already given sales guy #1 and #2 and COMMIT TO BUYING THE CAR BEFORE WE TALK PRICING.
- Now we are upset, and ask for our keys back from the appraisal.
-Sales guy # 4 brings them out and says #3 is with another customer. (Are you kidding??)  This was so clearly a LIE because we can SEE # 3 outside, alone.
- #4 tries to follow us out, apologizing because they are busy on the weekend.  We said we'd come back and he said they only have the deals on the weekend. Catch 22.
We, and everyone else we have talked to, found this to be completely unacceptable behavior from any business.  We will drive 30 miles farther away to NOT have to work with this dealership.< /text>< resp>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>After a bad experience at Sunnyvale Ford, I decided to use the internet to find the car I wanted and a sales person who I wanted to work with. After exchanging emails with David Briones at Capitol Ford, we decided to go down and see what they could do and very glad I did. We purchased a Ford C-Max Energi.

David Briones was great to work with. I was on guard when we pulled into the dealership, but David greeted us and showed us the car. He was friendly to me and my family, including two small kids. I really felt like he went to bat for us and helped us get the car at a price that worked for us. It took several back and forth offers, but David was awesome and continued to push for us. It was a great moment to hear we had a deal. We even shared a laugh as my daughter asked if it came with the American Flag (part of the Labor Day decorations at the lot) and David told her he could do that. He also gave my son a balloon...

The dealership had hot dogs and hamburgers, chips and drinks available for lunch and outside picnic benches. We had lunch while negotiating which was nice. They have a small kids area with a TV and books. My kids enjoyed that area.

Once the car was purchased, they walked us through all of the car functionality. This was helpful given all of the new technology. We left the dealership very happy with our purchase. Big thanks to David Briones and team!< /Review>< username>

<name>Peter Sorotokin< /name><Text>Bought a new C-max Energi on Saturday. Went through a number of dealers on Capitol on Friday before, stopped at Ford dealership as well, but they did not have any Energi left. They told us, though that they will get them on Saturday at noon. Called Saturday morning, and they informed us that they indeed got them. Set up an appointment with a sales guy, but when we (4 people, icluding a 4-year-old) showed up, he was not there. They quickly found someone else to take care of us. There was no much pressure to sell. The guy went through all the features and was nice enough to let us drive all together by ourselves, not trying to squeeze in. Energi is nice, I liked it much more than other plug-ins that we saw the day before. Then we got back and the sales guy, Saidu Sulaiman, took over through there. He have made the offer on price and basically said that they cannot go down, as these cars where selling fast (easy to believe, given that they were out of them). We also went through various loan/lease options. Once we accepted the offer, the process was smooth and fast. They got me a bit better percentage on the loan than what I had at the preapproval from BofA. They got me through a very detailed explanation of the car features on the way out, paired my cell phone, and set up online link through SYNC feature. Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience, even 4-year-old liked it. One thing to mention: other dealers at this location seem to be nicer than average. Certainly a good spot to visit if you are not sure which brand to pick.< /Text><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808e33bcb835af47:0xc31807c34fffb7e4</gmap_id><rate>5</rate></record>

We always make an appointment in advance and when we drop off they tell us that they won't get to it for 2-3 days..... This has happened more than once and I was under the impression that that was the point of making an appointment... To avoid the  delay. Also getting in and out of this place is confusing, too many one-ways.<//text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) I went to Capitol Ford for service for my truck because it was understood a light on the board and they told me they checked it and that I had nothing and that it was ready and when I went to pick up my truck I still had the light on the board. I left to check it again and after two days they told me I had a damaged part of the engine and I had that problem and they told me I had nothing and it took me about three weeks to repair it. They called me I was already list I went to pick up my truck and everything looked good but I started to review it and to my surprise it was scratched from several sides, susia, and without gasoline my advice is that you put a lot of care in those things very badly, I served the client on their behalf. that one trusts that they are going to fix and take care of your car and that is not the case

(Original)
Fui a capitol ford por servicio para mi camioneta por que se entendió una luz en el tablero y ellos me dijeron que la revisaron y que no tenía nada y que ya estaba lista y cuando fui a recoger mi camioneta aún tenía la luz en el tablero la volví a dejar para que la revisarán otra vez y después de dos días me avisaron que tenía una parte dañada del motor y tenía ese problema y ellos me avian dicho que no tenía nada y bueno se tardaron como tres semanas en repararla me llamaron que ya estaba lista fui a recoger mi camioneta y todo se veia vien pero comense a revisarla y para mi sorpresa esta rayada de varios lados, susia, y sin gasolina mi consejo es que pongas mucho cuidado en esas cosas muy mal servisio al cliente por parte de ellos por que uno confía de que van a arreglar y cuidar tu carro y no es así<//review>
