I ordered something online and it was ready when I got there within an hour. Staff was also very helpful and friendly when I needed help with 2 40 pound bags of cat litter.  The young female store clerk gladly helped me to the car and loaded the bags in my trunk.<//review>

<review>Sorry but the service and selection were so meager. I was looking forward to going into this smaller Petco but I will not be going back. I'll just go to Petco. Do not recommend unleashed.< /review>< Pictures>

For the most part, I enjoy going to this store. The staff in the evening is always very nice and helpful. Shout out to the evening staff at Unleashed! Selection is usually stocked and the staff are always knowledgeable of their products. The 4-star rating here would be a 5 if I was talking solely about the night staff.

Unfortunately, this afternoon, however, the cashier—Michael—took it upon himself to pepper me with questions regarding how I am training my dog as well as asking me questions regarding where I’m having my dog trained, if I was a trainer, if the dog was mine, etc. Additionally, he assumed I was using a shock collar—I wasn’t—and continued to press me on it. I found this questioning and assuming to be inappropriate and distasteful.</text>

<text>Every time we come here we have problems at checkout. Never want to price match the web site and give us the deals when buying certain products. Always say it's one or the other. Takes 10-15 at checkout just because they have to call someone over to override everything then they don't want to honor the deals they have having. Live right down the street from here. In more then 3 times a month spending $50-100 on cat and dog food and give us problems every time. Will no longer go here. This last visit I put every thing back on the counter and walked out. (They were having a deal on hills cat food, buy a bag and get a free pale of cat litter, price online for cat food was 24.99 vs the $28.99 in store. She wouldn't give the cat litter if we price matched. Said one or the other) umm... No that's not how it works sorry

Edit. We went to the Petco in Montclair and was treated so much better. They actually we able to load my $5 reward that the unleashed girl said I didn't have and didn't believe me when I showed her my phone showing it was loaded. I don't know if she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on us but we will NOT be back to this location. We spend way too much money there to be treated like that. Even made donations to the cat area before. Never again< /text><user_id>102824099582744679321< /user_id>< response>

Their supply is more limited than a regular Petco and would most definitely not recommend this place over PetSmart. They are decent when you need somewhere close and are in a pinch.< /review>

The staff are so kind, get to know their customer's dogs by name, very cool!  My only complaint is that the class and puppy play classes on their website is not updated and from three experiences, just plain wrong. Both stores I've been to have said they can't touch the schedule on the website. So call before you go :)<//text>

< Review>
I purchased (2) Zodiac Flea and Collars for small dogs on July24th, 2018.  When I opened both boxes the collar were dry and colors of white and hard.  I figured maybe they might still work.  I gave my dogs a bath with the Flea shampoo and put the collars on both dogs.  After a few days the dogs still itched and the shampoo and the collars did not work.  It was a waist of money and time to buy the Advantage treatment shampoo for dogs and puppies and the Zodiac Flea and Tick Collars.  I threw away my receipts thinking it was a waist of time to go back and complain.  I will never return to this store again.</Review>

High prices and limited selection. Yes, another Claremont business that charges you more than what you should pay for basic pet needs. Ya, I would drive deep into Upland, Montclair, or San Dimas but this place is right around the corner from my house...so what I save in gas, I invest in my dogs' toys and food...nice people though. 😊</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) NO AND I GO BECAUSE IT IS NOT WHERE THERE ARE BRANCHES LAMAS NEAR GUANAJUATO.
I SAW A VIDEO OF A FEW BOYS WHO WERE AND I LIKE THE STORE THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO TO BUY MY DOG THERE.
IT'S CALLED PETCO TRUTH.

(Original)
NO E IDO PORQUE NO SE DONDE HAY SUCURSALES LAMAS CERCA DE GUANAJUATO.
VI UN VIDEO DE UNOS MUCHACHOS QUE FUERON Y ME GUSTO LA TIENDA POR ESO QUIERO IR PARA COMPRARLE AHÍ A MI PERRO.
SE LLAMA PETCO VERDAD.< /Text></record>

<review>Wonderful experience! I order a medication for my dog’s heart that is hard to find and often has long shipping times. Gary helped me find my order, updated my account and expedited my shipment! I am so grateful to Gary for helping me keep my dog healthy. Thank you for the amazing customer service!<//review>< resp>

< review>
My dog passed away and I asked the company to stop the refills of her medication via their online chat option. They assured me they would, but my card was still charged and the refills still arrived. For multiple months.  I've reached out multiple times since then via email, via chat, via phone, and cannot get them to refund me the money from all of the refills sent to me.  They have opted to refund one refill, but not the other, even though I was told the refund would be issued. It's been exhausting trying to communicate with anyone at the company who can provide a timeline and answer.<//review>

I have three dogs and I have an awful time finding the Glucosamine chews that they all love. I know I can always find it here and at a better price than at my vets (which are sold out quite often). Shipping is always fast and it keeps my three pups running. My yellow lab is having some hip problems and when I start to run out and start to ration her Glucosamine, I can always tell as she will start to limp. So, I always come to Entirely Pets to get my Glucosamine for my fur-babies.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I tried to place an order on line today. As I had problems processing this, I called for customer support. Before I placed the order, I went into my account and redeemed rewards to use towards this order. The customer service rep was totally incompetent. Besides having problems with what I wanted, he proceeded to tell me I did not have a reward in the amount I said. I had taken a snapshot of it, along with getting an email confirming my reward. He basically told me I did not have this reward. After 25 minutes with him on the phone and being totally frustrated, I asked to talk to a supervisor. I was told there wasn’t one there and another person got on the phone. She also told me I did not have this reward and I should have taken a snapshot of it. I told her I had, and that’s where I got the numbers to give them. She made me feel like she was doing me a favor by giving me the $$ value of the rewards. I am very upset and will be calling back to talk to someone higher up the food chain.< /text>< pics>

<userid>106775196938408743728< /userid><review>Excellent products and customer service!  I have ordered from Entirely Pets for years and have always been pleased with their products and customer service, when needed.  I had ordered the large bags of Pure Bites from Amazon in the past, and every time I received my order, the bags had not been packaged properly and were compressed leaving the treats crushed, in crumbs with a lot powder in the bag (because they are freeze-dried, they are more delicate).  I have begun ordering through Entirely Pets, and each time the order arrives promptly, well packed and in perfect condition.  During the last order I tried to place online, the website was experiencing some issues, so I called customer service.  I spoke with Yarisma Contreras, who was wonderful and able to assist me in placing my order quickly over the phone.  Yari was very helpful, professional and efficient.  I am happy any time I can support and recommend other/smaller businesses which offer you great products, prices and customer support like Entirely Pets.  Thank you!<//review>< GmapID>

The web-site service would not allow me to change my address!  But Shettal was able to navigate through the order site's labyrinth and get my order processed.  THANK YOU.</Text>

"Would you like to wait, or cancel your order for an immediate refund?" I told them I would like an immediate refund. Had to file a Paypal case over $18?

< Review>
Placed an order for several items on January 28, 2020, and was advised within 24 hours that the items I had ordered were ALL out of stock.  I heard nothing more from Entirely Pets for three months. I sent a followup email on April 29, 2020, requesting a refund.  I received a "boiler plate" we're looking at your request email almost immediately.  On May 11, 2020, I again emailed and advised I had heard nothing from them.  As of today (May 18, 2020) I have heard nothing from anyone at Entirely Pets.  I will never do business with this company again, nor will I recommend them - in fact, just the opposite.  As with other reviewers, wish I could them a "NO STARS" score.  No communication = no stars.<//Review>

I wish I would've read a review before I ordered from Entirely Pets. I'll keep it simple: the bucks you'll save on your order will not be worth the time and pain of dealing with following up with them over and over and over again. Worst online purchase follow thru EVER.</review>

<review>I received all of my order minus the sterile eye drops, which outlast the eye-wash by at least 2 to 1. I have written to Entirely Pets in the past to that effect. I was billed less, minus the difference. And, I am glad that I got my order in a reasonable amount of time, versus waiting for one item to arrive. I am not entirely sure if the one item will eventually straggle behind. But, you know that Entirely Pets does have people, whom are responsive to my requests, and care about the people whom they support, with their pet supplies. Also, this is a truly personal posting, and is not influenced in any way by Entirely Pets or advertisers for any particular product.< /review>< Time>

<review>THE WORST ALL AROUND!  Ordered dog treats. Get email stating your order is on its way. Then get email saying it’s back ordered. A month later my dog tells me to give em a call to inquire where his treats are. I call to get the rudest customer service representative ever. Interrupts me twice, gives me a fake name, gives me a false status of my order, and when I ask to speak with his supervisor he transfers me to a voicemail box(probably his). Find out after speaking with an alleged supervisor that item has been discontinued with there company. When I asked “when were you going to let me know?” he had no answer. This place is clown shoes all the way around. Who hires these clowns?  These incompetent employees must know somebody to get hired or possibly give sexual favors to keep their jobs.<//review><rate>1<//rate>< Pictures>

If my dog could speak he would say "Thank You",  "Love those ham bones"! I love them too because they give me a little peace while he is eating them. hehe<//Review>

I love that I can get the same product from Entirely Pets vs. my vet which the vet charges twice as much.  The shipping is fast and my pets are happy. Thanks Entirely pets.<//Text>

<text>First time using Entirelypets for my horse and I was happy with my order. I ordered digestion supplements. At first the order was delayed due to unclear billing information but once I got in touch with them they quickly fixed the problem and got my product in a few days at no additional charge. Staff was very good and response time was good - overall I was very happy. I would definitely order again!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>My only concern was the products were shipped in a USPS shipping bag instead of a box as usually was done previously. When i got them the bag was not torn but the contents were crushed. This was due I feel to the way USPS handles their packages (throwing them around and putting heavy Items on top of smaller Items which is a USPS issue where they just don't care about the packages they are entrusted with that is why I use UPS or Fedex). I hope that you return to shipping products in boxes as has been previously done to protect the product.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The ducks are great quality and the only reason I give them a 3 star is because the size small was still over 9 inches I was looking for the 4-5 inch ducks I had purchased before. That is all my tiny dog will play with.< /text>

Proceed with Caution with EntirelyPets - First I want to say that the mistake on the order was my fault.  I am writing a negative review because of poor customer service.  I ordered a dog door for a new building project.  Of course my contractor got behind schedule and 4 months went by before we needed the door.  The door was not going to work. So since I hadn't even opened the box I thought I would see if I could exchange it.  I contacted EntirelyPets and they informed me that thier return policy is 30 days.  Makes sense, I understand the need for this type of policy.  I explained my situation the the customer service rep said that they would not exchange the door.  I offered to pay a restocking fee and still no.  Seems like they could have accomodated me and made money in the process.  Just bad customer service in my opinion.</Text>

This company is the worst. Expect LONG delays. Expect every email response to begin with "unfortunately.....".  The prices are great but the frustration was too much. I'd rather pay more and get reliable delivery and service.</Review>

< Review>
This company is terrible!

I ordered flea meds for my dog and decided to pay an extra $8.95 for Priority Mail shipping instead of having it shipped for free with Standard First Class shipping, as I was anxious to start the meds on my dog as soon as possible. However, they ended up shipping the package by First Class shipping instead. When I contacted them about receiving a refund for my shipping costs, since they shipped First Class Mail, they completely refused.

They are super nice when you want to place an order. However, once they have your money, they couldn't care less about your business, and are outright rude.</Review>

Literally, every staff member I encountered was so kind and so professional. The lady behind the front desk was kind enough to check me in even though I had leave and run to the bank because I left my card at home. The doctor was professional and funny.The lady who did my examination with the puff of air held my hand so I could try to work up the courage to keep my eyes open. The lady who helped me with my prescription glasses was thorough and knowledgeable with helping me with my warranties to replace glasses and lenses that I bought last year... and I won't owe anyone a penny. I am blown away by the level of care I received today. Thank you!

Oh and they have anti-fog stuff for glasses that actually works for $15.<//Text>

I was MORE than pleasantly surprised. The location threw me off but once INSIDE, the office and restroom was immaculate! The staff was professional and greeted me upon my entrance. They maintained their respectful demeanor with each individual entering their office. All employees and patients wore masks and they practiced social distancing. I highly recommend Vision Express to anyone seeking a truly professional experience! 😀<//review>

<review>Thank you so very much to Dr. Shin and the staff at Vision Express Optometry. The whole office is a great place. The staff is so helpful and caring. Dr. Shin was very patience with my husband, who suffered a stroke and has communication issues. We purchased glasses as well and the selection is great. Thank you so very much for a pleasant and hassle free appointment. I highly reccomend Vision Express Optometry.<//review>< name>

Vision Express Optometry is the worst
Optometry I ever experienced.
I felt like the crews there were sharks eager to rip off their customers.
They try to sell out their stocks pricing at $240.00, which I can easily buy at $40.00 at the regular stores.
They show cheap or poor articles only when their customers want to get one within the insurance coverage of $175.00.<//Text>

Did my eye exam on Saturday and by Tuesday they had my glasses ready for me. They even opened up for me after closing so I could pick them up after work. Couldn't say enough good things about Vision Express.</text>< Pics>

<review>This doctor's office is always very professional and with Covid They are following all protocols necessary to ensure the safety of their customers. They even lock the doors which helped me feel safer. Because their location is really in a bad area. I was approached outside for a cigarette by some nutso hobo and not like I care to tell anyone no but its still annoying to deal with loitering idiots. But at least the staff make up for it.< /review>< user_id>

I have tried several different optometry locations around the area. I can say without hesitation this place is the best by far. Great Doctor and amazing staff, very friendly and helpful especially (LIZ). Made me feel very comfortable and taken care of.
All I ever ask is that me and my family be treated with patience and respect.

Well Done to the Doctor and staff. You are all greatly appreciated.<//Text>

Everyone is so welcoming and friendly the moment you come in. They take their time and the vision exam is stress free. The optometrist took her time to explain everything to me and made sure I didn’t have any questions. When it came time to pick my glasses, they didn’t rush me. Overall I am so happy I came here. Best experience at an optometrist appointment I’ve had.< /text>

<Review>This was my first visit to Vision Express Optometry. It really is like an express!!!!!
This staff has their business down and it runs like a well oiled machine!!!!!!
Dr Shin and his staff were all courteous and helpful.
The prices were also very good.  I chose a basic package for glasses, along with an exam and of course you can choose much more expensive frames and get a few more options than I got if you so desire.
I would highly recommend this place and will be back!!!!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Everyone was so helpful
Making my appointment was easy
I did everything over txt
It was easier than going in or calling on the phone
Did a full eye exam on a Saturday and even got to pick out some glasses
The girl that helped me pick out my glasses was very knowledgeable and she helped me pick some very cute glasses
Thank you to everyone< /text>

< Review>
Have been coming here for years. Looks questionable due to the shopping center they are in but don't let that dissuade you. Wonderful office staff who are very patient and helpful at picking glasses. Fair prices. And the doctor will spend as much time as needed. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new optometrist.</Review>

Brought my son here for his first eye exam &  as soon as I walked in we were greeted by the nice lady at the desk. Signed him in and waited all but a few minutes before we where called for his exam. They had a nice little waiting area and Mrs Doubtfire was playing on the tv.. great movie & kid friendly..  Had a great experience with the doctor which my son actually liked, he was very friendly and made my son feel comfortable during the visit. They had a nice selection of glasses from low to high priced and my son loved that they made it about him and let him try on all the glasses he needed until he found the right pair that suited him... all around amazing staff & amazing doctor!!</review>

My first time visiting this place, and haven't had my eyes checked for almost 11 years and it was a great experience. My appointment was at 9am and was seen around 9:10. Staff was nice, the place was clean and the Doctor was also very nice as well. Overall I had no problems with this place.<//text>

<review>I thought everyone there was nice and accommodating. They really helped me figure out my best choice for my prescription and insurance coverage. The only drawback, and it is a big one, I was seen by the optometrist almost a full hour after my scheduled appointment time.<//review>< Pics>

I just had to visit again today and I chose to get contacts this time. I arrived an hour early and I was in and out of the appt before my schefuld appt
That was an exam and new contacts. They are so helpful and friendly in there. I won't go anywhere else from now on. Thank you Vision Express Optometry Dr and staff you're the best.👍💯< /review><rating>5< /rating><UserId.>113056896723004905900< /UserId.>< Date>

After first visit, the staff were pleasant, knowledgeable, and most helpful in choosing the type of lens and frames that will daily-wear well. The Optometrist was professional, pleasant, calming, and adept enough to diagnose and prescribe lens that perform best for my Wife's conditions. We have full confidence in the Optometrist and staff, and is now our preferred choice for prescription eyewear.<//Text>

From the curb, this place looks like it's going to be teeny tiny.  Don't be fooled, they have a massive office, and tons of frames.  I was impressed with their pretty darn good selection, clean office, and nice staff.  I didn't end up finding what I was looking for, but I think this will be where I head back to when I'm up for my next eye exam.  FAR better than the place I had my exam in 2011.</review>

The eye doctor was nice and thorough, however the staff is absolutely rude. Never have I experienced unexplanatory staff who simply want to rush you out and make you feel awkward. Not only that but they don't measure the spacing between your eyes unless you pay them extra for it. Never again will I ever visit this awful office. Bunch of crooks!</text></record>

I went in for my exam. I got the prescription and took it to Costco to have my glasses made. When I got them they I found it difficult to see. They asked me to give it some time to see if my eyes would adjust. I wore them for three weeks and could not so I went back and they made new lenses for me. The vision was only slightly improved but still nowhere near as good as with my old glasses. Costco told me to return to the optometrist and have the prescription checked. They are now telling me that I have to pay for another exam because I waited more than 30 day. A terrible way to do business. Be warned!< /Review>

< Review>
Strongly recommend this optometry! highly qualified staffs who are caring about the patients care and the customer service, doctors are thorough and give the plenty of attention that patients need. and not to mention the variety of brand names of eye glasses and sunglasses they offer.
I researched and asked around people in hesperia to look for the optometry that i can take my family of 4 but everyone who received a service seems to really like vision express optometry.
highly recommend!!!!!!!!</Review>

<Text>This place is great. Customer service is great.  Girls are nice and friendly.  Doctor is awsome. Took the time to answer all my queations.  When it was time for my son to sit in the chair he explained to him what he would be doing and what all his tools were for.  We had a great experience. The office is eye candy clean and neat.  They could use a few more chairs but over all great place.<//Text></record>

Been going here over 10 years but my last experience, picking up glasses and contacts, was the worst. The woman at the front desk had no regard for what I had to say and even rolled her eyes while I was speaking to her.. trying to understand why I was being charged $25 more than my receipt showed. I'll be using a new optometrist<//Text>

Evidently they overbook, I waited 30min to be called , which took 10 to 15 min, then was asked to wait for the Doctor. After waiting almost 45 min I left without seeing the Doctor!! I guess all Doctors think we.have nothing better to do than wait on them!!</text>

Get ready to wait and watch the doctor grab folders out of order making your wait even longer! An hour and a half wait with an appointment is ridiculous! Totally unprofessional and their service had fallen apart drastically over the years! Don't waste your time and i would highly recommend looking for another place!<//Text>

Great vision care! We have been coming here for a several years and the vision care has always been excellent. The optometrist explains everything in simple terms and provides all the necessary information to make decisions regarding your eye care (i.e. Lasik procedures, contacts, type of frames, etc.).  If needed they follow-up with the primary health insurance for ophthalmologist referrals. The staff has extensive knowledge and thoroughly explains your options based on your prescription for lenses, add-ons, etc. They have a wide variety of frames available.  Overall this place is great!<//Text>

Excellent doctor kind and very informative , great clean facility, only down fall is that there's very little variety for glasses if your insurance only covers 150  for the glasses. I was shown the glasses that my insurance covered and it was only one row out of many others and a few from differennt sections which was only 2 glasses from a different section  and most of the glasses from that row looked similar weren't a lot of different styles its not worth it there's a bit more in the 175 range but most glasses were above 180 which is an out range coming from a 16 year old (not recommended if your insurance only covers 150 and your looking to save& have more varitey/styles to select from on that price range ) Highly dissapointed. . . Will never go there again<//Text>

My husband was desperate to get this new glasses within a reasonable time. We had called around and most places told us 8 days to get new glasses. This was not acceptable since he cannot see without them. We called Vision Express and they said it would be no more than 48 hrs. We where excited, 48 hrs was ok with us! Better than 8 days!

So we rushed down there! They had a good selection and reasonable prices. We made sure they where open on Saturday and they said they would call us when the glasses came in. We asked more than once to make sure we where not hearing things! My husband has been suffering from a severe headache because his other glasses where ruined.Whew we couldnt wait!

Saturday rolled around and NO CALL! We called them but they closed early. They were no open Sunday or Monday for Holiday. So finally its Tuesday and we want an explanation. They said "sorry we got too busy and forgot to call you". My husband told them that wasnt good enough we had asked them more than once when we came in there, they said "we know you couldnt see and werent feeling good but we got too busy".

Not a good enough answer for me folks! I am a business owner and when I say I am going to do something by a certain date I do it! No excuses! I will not be going here again!</review>

<user_id>104876953329957389149<//user_id><Review>I have been coming to Crown Barbershop for years now. Always feel welcomed, and like I am visiting with friends. Over the years, i have gotten to know the team there. Everyone from Misty, Mayra, Rosie, Alex, Dan, Steve, and Zach, have all been exceptional, friendly, personable barbers, that make you feel at ease, and welcomed, the moment you walk in. They do quality work, and you’ll always leave feeling better than before you walked in. Lately Zach has been my go to, as i go in primarily for a beard trim and shave. Zach has a talent with that knife, as in you barely even feel it.  Talented hands, easy to talk to, and very efficient. Crown Barbershop is a jewel in Coronado. Do yourself a favor and drop in.<//Review>< Rate>

Rosie works tomorrow from 9:30-6:30 and you can make an appointment if you would like as well.\n\nThank you for your service.  We are a family (military as well) owned business.  The quality of our barbers is superior and we feel our prices are more than fair.  Once you try the others I think you may be back.  Best of luck to you in the meantime.'}</response><Rate>3</Rate><text>Just got my haircut at Crown about an hour ago.  Great atmosphere.  My barber [Rose?] was great, very kind and definitely listened to me.  So if I hadn't come home to the screwed up mustache, as seen in the picture, the rating would definitely have a 4---strictly due to the price.  I blame it on myself for not noticing at the barber shop when she handed me the mirror but I was looking more at the haircut itself.

I chose the barbershop because they had better ratings and the other reviews said they did a military discount---what I didn't realize is the discount is for active duty only.

I am a retired Marine mostly living as a nomad and spent the last 9 months in my RV all over the US.  Admittedly not ever in a big city where prices are no doubt much more expensive.  I get my haircut every 2-3 weeks and always look for a local barbershop with good ratings.  I always get both the hair and beard cut/trimmed.

The most expensive cut I had was in Memphis and Vermont for $18.  Most of the east coast all the way up to Maine was $15 for both hair and beard.

I spent three months in South Padre Island TX which, like Coronado, is also a beach and tourist town---I was always charged $12 and gave a $20 to include the tip.  I just left Eloy AZ after a month there, it's just north of Tucson---same cost, $12, $20 with tip.

I spent $40 today and that's the reason for the intended 4 rating.  I have absolutely no doubt the bad moustache trim is an aberration and would try again if not for the price.  $25 for the haircut and $8 for the beard trim in my mind is too much.  [I always give a good tip and always will as I recognize how blessed I am to have a cost of living adjusted retirement.]

Bottomline is I'm going to spend a lot of time here in Coronado as that is where the girlfriend is.  While I love that Crown is within walking distance there is no way I'm spending $40 every two-three weeks---guess I'll be driving to a nearby base.<//text>< user>

<text>Great place! They need to be allowed to open up shop and continue providing their excellent service. Haircuts may not be considered "essential", but they need to be able to keep their business going so the employees can pay their bills. At a minimum, let them operate outdoors. This is out of control!<//text>< user_name>

This is my go-to spot for a good barber. Active duty haircuts are $12, and really clean. They even use a straight razor to clean up!</Review>

Just got my haircut at Crown about an hour ago.  Great atmosphere.  My barber [Rose?] was great, very kind and definitely listened to me.  So if I hadn't come home to the screwed up mustache, as seen in the picture, the rating would definitely have a 4---strictly due to the price.  I blame it on myself for not noticing at the barber shop when she handed me the mirror but I was looking more at the haircut itself.

I chose the barbershop because they had better ratings and the other reviews said they did a military discount---what I didn't realize is the discount is for active duty only.

I am a retired Marine mostly living as a nomad and spent the last 9 months in my RV all over the US.  Admittedly not ever in a big city where prices are no doubt much more expensive.  I get my haircut every 2-3 weeks and always look for a local barbershop with good ratings.  I always get both the hair and beard cut/trimmed.

The most expensive cut I had was in Memphis and Vermont for $18.  Most of the east coast all the way up to Maine was $15 for both hair and beard.

I spent three months in South Padre Island TX which, like Coronado, is also a beach and tourist town---I was always charged $12 and gave a $20 to include the tip.  I just left Eloy AZ after a month there, it's just north of Tucson---same cost, $12, $20 with tip.

I spent $40 today and that's the reason for the intended 4 rating.  I have absolutely no doubt the bad moustache trim is an aberration and would try again if not for the price.  $25 for the haircut and $8 for the beard trim in my mind is too much.  [I always give a good tip and always will as I recognize how blessed I am to have a cost of living adjusted retirement.]

Bottomline is I'm going to spend a lot of time here in Coronado as that is where the girlfriend is.  While I love that Crown is within walking distance there is no way I'm spending $40 every two-three weeks---guess I'll be driving to a nearby base.< /Review>

<review>I tried setting up an appointment for over a week. I understand the virus makes things hard. However I called several times and the person that picked up the phone (always seemed to be the same person) was acting like it was a chore talking to me. Everytime I tried calling they would always end the call abruptly and acted pretty rude. Normally it's pretty hard to irritate me but they were always rude. That being said when I went to them in the past I always got a great cut and the active discount is great< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We had over 200 phone calls last Wednesday and I have done my best to return calls and accommodate schedules.  We hired a young lady to answer the phone Thursday and Friday.  Our outgoing message asks you to leave your name and number.  We must now wear a mask while cutting hair and trying to answer a phone and cut hair with that, then washing hands every time we touch a phone, it is a lot.  Again, it sounds like you spoke to me so I apologize if I sounded stressed, I have been stressed.  Why did you not make the appointment?'}</Resp>

The employees will give you no direction when you walk in just walk back to the rear of the shop for the waiting area. The service was quick and great! I was not happy with $25 for a buzz cut and a neck cleanup, but I am in California, not home   (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) ... So I accept it.<//review>< pics>

<text>I went to Crown Barber on last Saturday afternoon, which I thought was a mistake but I was very wrong. I sat in the waiting area for about 5 min when a seat opened up. I forget the name of the barber, he had the chair closest to the front door. He did an AMAZING job on my hair! I will definitely be a returning customer.
Thanks Misty for having such awesome barbers!</text><Time>1528315619616<//Time>< response>

<text>I am a barber From Pittsburgh PA, I am on vacation in Coronado while walking down the street I noticed a cool looking barber shop out of the corner of my eye so I figured I'd stop in. As soon as I stepped foot in the door I said "Hello" and the women in the front was absolutely ignorant to me... I simply walked in just to see a barber shop in California since I am a Barber from the east coast... Not a good experience!<//text>< Rate>

Only reason this place is worth it is because of the Manager, Janet and her husband. Gate hours are terrible 8am to 5pm. 7 days a week except holidays.<//Review>

Theirs locations everywhere, we hadn't rented storage in so many years. Prices have really gone up. After shopping around, I decided to stay with Secure, the young lady in the office was very polite and showed us the unit before renting. Wow, she can do a contract. She is fast and informative. Answered every question we had. She went over all rules with us so nothing is a surprise. Very professional, customer service is great! The facility is not the newest, however you also not paying 200 dollars a month for a small unit. We only pay $60.00 for a 5x10 that is on special. No complains here.</Review>< Pictures>

Girlfriend has a small storage space (more like a closet honestly!) here. But it's a pretty large and secure property. And it's right next to a CHP station so you got the ultimate security right there!</Review>

After checking out a few places in the area this was the most inexpensive. They show you the unit before renting it to make sure you are happy with what you are getting. I have been with them for over a year now, I make the time to say hi to the staff when I come in. If I ever need anything they are Always willing to help, weather it be a new light bulb, a flat head, cart or simply use the restroom.</text>< pics>

Rented a small unit for a few months didnt have any problems. Great customer service, clean, diff options on how to pay. Would definitely rent from here again if needed. Only thing they can maybe change is the access hours.<//Review>

Mice infestation. Even with no food or water in unit, mice will get into your stuff, chew things up, make nests, excrete on your belongings, etc. Not good. Enter/exit code system is antiquated. They will raise your rates however/whenever they like.< /text>

I was notified and had to
Leave  work to see the damage.

I kindly asked if they would pro rate my rent in the amount of my missed hourly wages and was told “NO, I can’t offer you any compensation.”  They didn’t even offer me a new unit.

The manager is dishonest & runs it like a concentration camp. She used unacceptable profanity after I denied her allegation against me (did not do it) & threatened me with an eviction if I didnt admit it. I moved out on my own. Nothing is worth that kind of abuse. Giving it one star is being nice.<//Review>

With the exception of my 2 days off, I was not able to access my stuff. It is quite obvious that there is an abundance of homeless people who store their stuff there. They are in and out of their vans; packing and unpacking all their clutter in their cars- continually riding their bikes through the place and leaving their left over fast food containers everywhere.  I arrived to my storage item several times to find old food items left on my spot on my rig.  I had some work done ony rig and took it out early in the month. I called 7 days before end of month and asked for a partial reimbursement on my rent since I would not be coming back for the remainder of the 7 days and was told there would be no refunds. That hardly seems fair since they can rent my spot and basically collect double rent. I encourage anyone renting from anywhere to ask alot if questions and read the fine print.  On a gpod note, staff were usually helpful and of course it's controlled access.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I've used them 3 times now, always friendly and they really go the extra mile. I've bounced around from shop to shop, never quite happy, until now. The work is fairly priced and costs less than the other shops I've been to. Speedy turnaround time, courtesy shuttle, and complimentary car wash to finish up. And they remember their customers by name. Would not hesitate to recommend anyone here<//text>

These folks were amazing! I broke down travelling through, the Dodge dealership was worthless and pawned me off (thankfully) to Pro Pacific, who  efficiently diagnosed, consulted  and went above and beyond to help me. Lucky, lucky town to have these amazing,qualified folks. Thank you! Again Pro Pacific.<//review>

I am not from around Humbolt, however when I was visiting a friend at CSUH my car broke down.I was freaking out because I needed to drive home to Sacramento. I called Pro Pacific and I spoke with Ford, he was so nice and he offered to have me come in and see what they could do even though they were fully booked for the day. When I got there I spoke with Tara, and I was crying and panicking and she really helped calm me down and explained all my options. Ford was there as well and he helped explain what was going on, he gave me "My friends dad" vibes. It ended up being a catalytic converter issue and I had to leave my car with them for about a week but they were in constant communication and updated me with any important info. When I did finally get my car back they were so nice and they really gave me a good price and I felt like I could trust their work. As a young girl who was not from the area, they took excellent care of my problem and I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs car help in Arcata. Ford and Tara are great.</text>

These guys do a great job. Actually care and don't over charge or recommend anything unnecessary. They're realistic about the depth of people's wallet. The staff is always courteous and helpful.

Travelling down from Vancouver Island on Hwy 101, vacation road trip, when my exhaust pipe failed. The only place open on Saturday I could find was Pro Pacific Auto. I stopped by in the morning and they were very busy and I could see a line up of vehicles and customers there. After explaining my situation to Bill, a technician came and looked and figured it might be patched. Bill squeezed us in and the job was done in about 1 1/12 hours. They did much more than a patch job using spare parts they fortunately found. They provided us with a shuttle to and from our hotel while we waited. Thanks for the ride Victor! An awesome bunch of guys, very professional and courteous. They bailed us out big time. Highly recommended! Big time!! Nice memory of Eureka! Good folks there!</text>

<Review>We were in Eureka doing some work, when we experienced some significant issues with our Chevy Suburban. In great need of our vehicle for work, we pulled into the local Chevrolet dealership. Due to it being late in the evening, they told us they could not help us, but very politely and with confidence referred us to Pro Pacific Auto Repair.

Upon arriving at Pro Pacific, we were greeted by a very nice service advisor who was very understanding to our situation, with it being 4:30pm and with the issue we were facing. Another gentlemen said he would put a code reader on the car and let us know what the problem with the vehicle was. He immediately advised us of the problem, which was an issue with the fuel system. This gentlemen, Mike Bates, who turned out to be the owner of Pro Pacific, could not have more comforting, friendly, professional and most importantly determined to get us back on the road. He and his staff immediately jumped on the problem, they stayed overtime, and within one hour had us back on the road.

The best part of this experience was the honesty and integrity in diagnosing the problem, and the integrity in the cost of fixing the issue. I say this with great conviction, “that you all in Eureka are very lucky to have a great company like Pro Pacific Auto Repair.” A Big Thanks to the entire staff, especially Mike and Ford and the two wonderful service advisors. Bless You All and next time we are in town we stopping by, hopefully to just say “Hello,”</Review><rating>5</rating>< userid>

<Text>Instead of just doing the work they were asked to do, they actively  looked for other problems. Go in for $350 worth of work and they suggest $2000 more for a problem that may not even exist. If you have an older vehicle, avoid  this place.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>They crashed my vehicle and didn't tell me. I found out after driving home. Called and talked to Ford, who said he was Manager. He told me it didn't happen and got very hostile. I drove from shop to home didn't stop any place. Had big scratch on my door. Then my wife seen there shuttle van has large damaged spot also.  Over charge for simple jobs. They changed me 30 plus percent over book time, plus fee for checking on the repairs. Parts are marked up over 50 percent from parts store. They suggested I change all my fluids at 30,000 miles. When I asked about manufacturer suggested maintenance. They advised me they don't suggest following the manufacturer maintenance schedule. They want you vehicle not to last long so you buy another vehicle.  Please do yourself favor and tow your vehicle to different shop. Not wreck and crash automotive repair.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x54d1557c30c65e01:0x7b46a3e37754504b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Love them!  I can't believe how they bend of backwards to get you in on the schedule, clean the car after working on it, and know you by name when you walk in.  They were amazing to both my husband with his emergency car repair and my car needs as well.  Quality and integrity.  I never write reviews but these guys were so great I felt compelled.</text>

My 25 year old daughter went in to have her car looked at before she drove across the country to Connecticut and they charged her $1200 to replace alternator belt and have leaky rear wheel brake cylinders replaced and supposedly 1 rear wheel bearing replaced. What thieves!!! I hope you sleep well at night knowing that you took money from a young girl with none. You bent her over good! But you have to live with yourselves now.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Came in on a cold Saturday afternoon with a broken window and a car full of gear trying to road trip down 101.  Every other place in Eureka/Arcata was closed or not able to help, but we stopped by Pro-Pacific and Rob and staff has us back on the road with a fixed window just 45 minutes and $84 later. Couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful and even diagnosed the (non-critical) intermittent check engine light that had come on with a full explanation of the problem.  Great little shop. Feel so lucky to have found them!</review>< pictures>

I was a traveler in Eureka. I couldn't start the my van there on Satuerday afternoon due to the key loose traction. So I let AAA leave my car to it since it's still open by 4:30pm. From my point of view, the part under the steering to hold the key need to be replaced.

Monday I called them from home and get estimate $450 parts (I heard key bushing related parts) +2.5 hour labor. Total will be $945. The tech wrote parts at different price $524 on the sheet late.

I called Tuesday, was told that the parts arrived in the afternoon. Wednesday morning done.

I uploaded the 2-page receipt images. Please read them and correct me, if you think they did a good job and charged me at fair price. I'd like to listen to experts' opinion.

I also upload the image shows how they installed my odometer cover back with a gap from its original position. A labor fee $702.27 did such job.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Very honest. Won't screw you. They do the work that is needed without saying that you need work that isn't needed to make a buck. I take all my vehicles there. They have the best mechanics around for general maintenance.<//Text>

We were treated honestly. Problem fixed & we were on our way. Great attitude throughout the shop.</text>

I have been taking my vehicles to this shop since 1995.  Recently I had my car over heat while driving.  I called the shop and they walked me through getting my car safely to their shop.  It happened to be one hose that had a leak, they replaced it without charging me!  It was recommended that I have my hoses replace considering they were original and I had almost 250,000 miles on my little car.  They didn't pressure me to make my appointment right then but I called later to schedule it.  My schedule is hectic and they made it so easy by taking to work and picking me up when my car was finish.
I've never had anything but good service from these gentlemen.
Thank you!<//review>

We stopped to this garage during our trip with a 1981 motorhome because there was a serious electrical issue on it.

They were booked for the next 2 weeks and I had to be back in Canada in 4 days.

So because they were very nice to us and tried to help as maximum I came back the next day to ask for advices.

They took 20min to look at the RV for free and told us to try to change a part ourself which reveals to be the cause of the issue we had (if ignition switch).

I just want to say a big thanks to them and the consideration they gave us !< /text>

The two men behind the counter are hostile and they told me to leave when I inquired about their price of parts...they doubled them from the prices I was quoted around town for the same parts. Then I was followed to my vehicle and assaulted while trying to leave. I would not send my worst enemy here for repairs.<//Review>

What a horrible experience. This may be a popular spot to take your vehicle, but I don't recommend it. Number one issue, they don't stand behind their work.

I had to take my truck to another shop to get it fixed after spending over $4,000 at this shop. They gave me poor advice on how to fix my issues, and kept recommending I spend more and more money. After they refused to do any more work without charging me more money, I took my truck to my trusted mechanic in Oregon who fixed the problem with one hour's labor and documented that Pro Pacific screwed up. Pro Pacific denied it, even though my truck runs great now and refused to cover the fix from the other shop. They over charge for parts, are poor communicators, take forever to try to fix things, and are overconfident in their own abilities.< /review>

<date>1621113875898</date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Josh handled the sale of my property that has been in my family for over 40 years with a lot of care and concern for what I was trying to accomplish. .   I called Josh on a Thursday letting him know that I was interested it in purchasing another property and I had to have my property in escrow by the following Monday to get my other offer accepted.  . He jumped at the challenge to get it in escrow and was able to procure An above asking purchase price by that Sunday.   This fast acting agent made it possible for me to get into escrow on my dream home! I can’t thank Josh enough for all of his help,  kindness and professionalism throughout. Without hesitation all five stars go to him and his team!< /Text>< Pics>

Josh was an amazing realtor for our family! I highly recommend him for anyone looking to buy or sell a home! Josh was patient, represented us well, and very laid back. No stress selling our home with Josh! If you are looking for someone who is professional but not pushy, Josh is definitely the way to go! Thanks Josh!</review>

<Text>I have worked with Josh for a few years and every transaction I have seen him so dedicated to his clients, keeping all parties in the  loop the entire time, communication seems to be lacking in today’s market and  even bad news he doesn’t hide or ignore, he just faces it! Every deal is not perfect but it’s how you handle the hurdles that counts and he perseveres! Definitely would want Josh on my side!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Simply put, Josh is the best real estate professional we have ever worked with. We interviewed some of agents we had used in the past, and when we interviewed Josh, we could tell the difference immediately. He understands the current needs of marketing a home to a fast close, and more importantly, how to secure the highest possible price for the seller.

We faced a scenario in our sale where we had many offers coming in all at once, and Josh helped us navigate this to the best outcome possible.

Both he and his entire support staff are highly responsive and professional. The entire process was seamless and hassle free.

No need to look further, Josh and his team are simply the best!< /text>

So incredibly grateful for Josh! We had been searching non stop and he was so patient and understanding with knowing what we needed for our little family. With his relaxed personality but determination of working hard to find us “Our Home”, I truly feel like we wouldn’t have had the experience we had and found the beautiful place we now get to call home. ❤️< /review>

Josh Painter of Impact Real Estate represented us in our real estate transactions with the selling and subsequent purchase of our new home. Josh was absolutely great throughout the process! Josh’s professionalism, courtesy, knowledge and advocacy of his clients makes him a unique individual in his profession. I find it extremely easy to recommend Josh to anyone planning on selling or buying property. We will most certainly be calling on Josh to assist us in the future.   Ed Diaz<//review>

I came across this agent Salvador Correa through Instagram, Initially I was a first time buyer & trusted his work & promises to help me purchase my first home, unfortunately my first attempt on purchasing a home had been the worse experience due to the unprofessionalism of Salvador Correa, he made me Lose my hard-earned money that was in escrow due to his unethical practices, Salvador did this to not lose his commission from the work he had does had he also make me sign paper work that I had no idea what I was signing and removing my contingencies without ever getting properly informed of the risk of that involved. He left me unprotected, He left me with a legal mess in which now I am getting sued for the actions of his unethical business practices. When I contacted his Broker, he was no help there was no desire to help I was just ignored and blocked.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>From the beginning, Josh was extremely efficient and thorough when listing our home. His deep sultry voice and calming demeanor made my wife and I feel really relaxed and in good hands.  When Josh arrived at our home to do a walk-thru before we listed; I realized that he was just as handsome as his photo.  So, after we walked through the house and feeling a little inadequate near him- he made me feel great when he said that the house would sell almost immediately.  Sure enough; our home sold that very weekend- all the while navigating through the COVID-19 crisis.  His team of escrow folks were world class and we couldn't be happier... I just wish I was as dashing to look at as Josh... oh well, çe la vie!  I would not hesitate to recommend or use Josh's services again.<//Text>< Pics>

Impact Real Estate helped me purchase my first house. I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to buy in December and was handed the keys by the end of February. I highly recommend.< /review>

I did give an estimated time of mid January . so in essence, I did over promise and under deliver. your husband gave me an initial time frame of mid March. there are some un truths here such as you being on assignment, you live in this town don't you? your trailer came in with a RESEAL and I got your insurance company to issue payment on the roof when you were to pay for it. your adjuster took almost 3 weeks to get back to me and never showed up I did their work for them. it then took another 2-3 weeks to issue payment. the insurance payment was deposited in my company account on Dec 28 and we were on vacation until Jan 4. YOUR HUSBAND GAVE ME AN ULTIMATUM so I took him up on it. with the weather and wind not cooperating I knew I could never make him happy. So I decided to take him up on his demands. we both could have handled this better if we're being honest. you were issued a check in the amount of $3151.06 and you were given a new entry handle of which I offered to install on the spot and you declined. the condition of the roof has been in that condition for quite some time with the front cap detached from the roof and that's the way it was received anyway your husband brought that to my attention and the trailer was stored with the front elevated so I presume your claim to be false. be careful in the future regarding ultimatums, you might just get what you ask for."}< /resp>

Unprofessional and a liar. Multiple calls for us to rush to get down there to cash a check. Told me would have it done at a specific time. Months went by. Never touched it. Gave an excuse and bashing his worker about tearing off the roof of the wrong RV (not ours)... which is even more concerning. Gave some random excuse for that. I’m a travel nurse and not only did he rush to take my money and proposed a timeline he did not meet, but also lost our keys when we came to pick up our RV that was never touched for months. To top it off the roof already needed repair, but when it snowed he never covered it up only causing more damage. Don’t waste your time, money, or breath... literally. He robbed our time, our money (by not completing the repair on time and I ended up having to pay for a hotel while on assignment and more repairs caused by the melted snow), and our sanity. I say sanity because he doesn’t own up to his mistakes. He will argue to your face and your reviews. He certainly doesn’t believe the customer is EVER right. At the end of the day .... just stay away.< /text>

We had a small propane leak in our hot water heater and our igniter wire needed to be replaced in our fridge. I called Vince and he took us in in less than 24 hours notice knowing we were in a pinch and traveling full time. We showed up and he fixed our issues in less than an hour. Vince is extremely knowledgeable and honest. I would highly recommend RV Depot for all of your RV needs.</text>

<review>Vince attempted to repair my RV, only to find it was outside his ability levels. I had an upper bunk that was sagging, and his repair included a horizontal brace that he ended up drilling through the front of my trailer. So now I have Three small screw heads sticking out the front of my fiberglass.  When I called to discuss, he said “it didn’t leave that way”. My response was maybe 500 miles of driving out pressure on the poor repair that was not completed as described.  Vince was very unprofessional and upset, and offered to look at the trailer if we brought it back, but we were halfway across he country by the time the poor repair became evident and was not feasible. He did begrudgingly refund me 200 dollars, after I insisted. In hindsight, I should I’ve fought the charge with my credit card company as the repair was more damaging than originally brought in, and he charged me over 500 dollars for it. He also charged me 100 dollars an axle to “repack” my trailer wheel bearings, but apparently this business thinks that hooking a zerk fitting up and filling with grease is what constitutes “repacking”.  They wheels were never removed and cleaned of old grease.

I suspect this may have been an honest man and business at some point, but maybe the desert has been hard on him and he’s lost his integrity. Vince is not an honest person, nor anybody I would ever do business with again.

Cue the unprofessional, finger pointing response from business owner.......now:

In response to the owner below: money was not refunded in full, you yelled and hung up on me during process.  If you’d like, you can call me and refund the remainder, but you did not refund all my money.

Wheels were never removed from vehicle, I know that for a fact. I marked them ;)

The bunk was rated for one person under 200 pounds, per the sticker on the interior of the trailer. One person was sleeping on this, and we never slept on it after the “repair” because it was sagging under its own weight.

Money was never an issue, you being unable to repair and accepting a job outside of your skill set was. I only hope somebody else can think twice before using this business.

Read the owners responses, he is apparently never wrong and it’s always the customers fault. Does this seem like a reputable business owner to you?</review>< pictures>

Stopped by the shop yesterday to see about getting an a/c fixed or replaced. Vince said he could do it next day. Next day, he arrived on time and within an hour, had a new unit installed and running. Great service and good price. Thanks, Vince.<//text>

Rv Depot has saved my sanity so many times he is always correcting errors that have been done incorrectly by another service shop. I pull up and he immediately gets to work and has my work trailer rolling in a speedy manner. Rv Depot is the best around. Well done and keep up the great work gentlemen.< /Text>

I’ve been to a lot of RV repair places in the high desert and they were all a joke compared to RV Depot. We replaced all tires for hundreds less than big O, and had all the other minor repairs done correctly and without any hassle. I still go back here even though we have moved. Don’t waste time just take your rig here.< /text>

Let it be known I am not bashing this business, it’s just my one personal experience. Give em a shot of you wish to. My wife and I have had our class A rv for 15 months in total so far and 8 of those months it sat on the lot at RV Depot, originally I had said because were moving there’s no rush for the list I had left to complete. Unexpectedly I didn’t think it would take 8 months. So timing issues happen I get that, then I had a budget and out a deposit of cash with receipt down to get the work started and finished, not a problem, then there’s months into it I call to check on it and nothing was done but parts were on order, ok covid hit we’ll wait for parts. Time continues on and somehow my lost was lost. That happens I get it. So I called and left a message so it could be written down again, yet no avail on list or it’s completion. What I requested specifically was a price before Starting individual jobs, never have I got any other than the one about the generator cost and it would be cheaper to fix than replace which is questionable for the price I paid. On top of that I was charged multiplied hours for a misdiagnosed battery problem, since I’ve been a mechanic for 17 years personally and I’m not bashing, that should’ve been an easy diagnosis and as a mechanic you ethically don’t charge customers for mechanical negligence. So I’m upset at that. Also had two new a/c roof mount installed, which one is missing the louvre that directs the air flow. The generator works but the switch in house to turn it on does not and it used to before rv Depot “fixed” the rv generator. The generator did run but had no output and not it runs has output but I have to go outside to turn it in and off, give and take I guess? I requested numerous times for the skylight to be replaced above the shower yet again another let down, nothing was done there. My rear slide creeps inwards after extension which tells me the solenoid May be bad but I’m little shy on my hydraulic mechanics Knowledge this also was asked about and never looked at. Now that there generator runs it leaks oil in what mechanics would describe as a class II LEAK. But at least it runs and the ac works... since sitting there so long I found out it will now cost me another $1000 for the newer tires that have dry rot and split in the sun. The plexiglass I had as a temporary window was pushed in and someone was in our rv while on the lot I found the pushed in window after the only two rainy days we’ve had here in the desert. It took two days to have the window fixed after I called and expressed my concern for that job completion. Yet it sat 8 months like that. I have had rv Depot work on my class c years ago and that’s what made me go back, now I’m desperate to find a local shop or mechanic that will take care of my needs and concerns so what little money I have left will be worth the wait. I’m so upset my wife is so upset we can’t even calm to rectify the situation. Hope this aids someone in looking for rv repair.</review>

<Resp>{'time': 1595857278676, 'text': 'Well chase\nLet’s start with time, I’ll admit it was too long but not 8 months as a matter of fact not even 6 mos look at the date of the order. By the way the deposit was a credit card not cash. you gave me a budget of 6k and told me no hurry, and the fact the coach didn’t even run when it got here. Does it run now? Oh that’s right, you drive it home. My helper was run over and his legs and ankles broken and that was communicated to you so it left me with no help. You received approximately 8k dollars worth of work for 5k dollars because you told me you didn’t have enough so things have to be cut out. If your gen leaks it’s didn’t when it was here. The skylight was unavailable to me and I did fix the drivers window with new glass and didn’t charge you. I couldn’t fix the slide ram due to your lack of funds which is not my problem and the fact that this is the second coach I’ve worked on for you. Means you were satisfied the first time. The extenuating circumstances with your health we are saddened by and hope you overcome the ailment. But really your regret is the money spent initially on the coach itself. Poor choice my friend. Bring it back I’ll fix the oil leak while you wait. As I said, you watched it run it didn’t leak here.'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This past week we were RV camping near Yucca Valley when our brand new hot water heater stopped working.  I found Vince at RV Depot online and asked for the part that I was SURE would fix it. I found Vince to be very knowledgeable and, although he didn't agree with my assessment, he was kind enough to disable a new water heater in his stock to sell me the part I wanted. After finding out that he was right and I was wrong, I returned to his shop where he was kind enough to give me my money back. I couldn't have asked for a nicer and more compassionate person. If you are camping anywhere near Yucca Valley, and have a problem with your RV, please give Vince at RV Depot a try - he does business the old fashioned way - caring about people!< /Text>< Pictures>

We had brake issues while traveling and were referred to RV Depot. Vince was able to diagnose the problem and set us up with electricity to stay in his lot while the part was located and delivered. He had his brake mechanic do the repairs as soon as the part arrived and had us back on the road.  Thanks RV Depot!< /text>

Called these folks when my fridge was acting wonky. They always answered the phone and questions I had quickly. the temperate would go from Freezing and then up to 46 degrees. I drove to their shop and they moved the thermistor. That didn’t work so it was replaced the next day. Works great now! I also had a handle added on outside of the coach door and they checked my shore cord box for issues, all good. Very, very happy with their service. Highly recommended.<//review>

Anyone that has experienced dealing with large rv outfits knows that you might be lucky to have it done in a month. I was a little disappointed that he didn't fix an issue with the LP setting on the fridge (after looking at it myself it looks like it was just a plugged orifice) but he more than made up for it with his generosity, understanding, and honest business practices.< /Text>< Pics>

We didn't expect much when we saw the place, but looks are deceiving. Not only did they have all the parts we needed to fix our RV problems, but the staff/owners were pleasant, very knowledgeable, and we recommend them highly.

<Text>Heater quit whilst camping, and resisted all my efforts, plus Google's advice, to fix. I became convinced it was a $200 part, but the gentleman passed up the sale.and had me unplug the part and reconnect it. Problem fixed over the phone.

<Time>1555026681329</Time><Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Vince, I wanted to wait to write this review until we got the electrical problem fixed so that I could inform other people of RV Depot’s shortcomings AND let YOU know where the electrical problem actually existed. I truly believe this problem was outside your abilities to diagnose and fix. I feel obligated to inform other newer, large and more complicated RV owners that it would be best to take their RV somewhere else so that they won’t have the experience I did. You should not have been paid by my extended service plan. YOU FIXED NOTHING and we left RV Depot in worse condition than when we arrived. I’m my book one who provides “service” should not be paid even if they can not solve the problem. For your information I did contact my service plan and they have this case under investigation.

The reason I did give RV Depot two stars is because Ken, (your assistant) seemed genuinely concerned and a very nice person. You made the right choice hiring him.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Your problem was actually fixed we also let you stay on our property with full hook ups without charge with your very dogs. Im sure some people would consider this a service over and above the call of duty. Obviously this is the reason for anonymity.  I welcome the review from the insurance co.

Great place and good people.  Vince and his wife Kim are straight up and honest, which is hard to find.  They are storing our RV for a great price and will do whatever they can to help with repairs, sales etc., that we might need.
In addition all the local food recommendations have been spot on!</text>

We had an emergency with our brand new RV and Vincent was extremely understanding and very nice to work with. He had us bring our RV in and was prompt to work on it but very considerate of knowing the frustration we've been through as our new RV has several other issues. We tried calling another place but they were rude and just didn't seem to care. We know we're in good hands with Vincent and that our RV will be fixed the proper way. Highly recommend this place!< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>For 4 months a different repair guy worked on the heating/AC problem before declaring it fixed, when it was not fixed. As soon as I got to 29P I called RV Depot, as they were highly recommended by locals, and (1) Vince was out here in two days (other folks Ive had to wait weeks for), diagnosed the problem right away, went out of his way to get the parts faster since weather is in the 90's, worked everything out with the insurance guy and got it all wrapped up quick and easy. I couldn't have asked for a better experience, AND, being a technical nerd, I especially appreciated the explanations of what was wrong. ANND he provided all kinds of tips for keeping this place cool on days like today, when I called them out again thinking there was something wrong with the AC again (turns out it's just not as cool in a bigger rig like this when it's this insanely hot outside). I can only hope I find repair guys as good as these guys in the rest of my travels.< /Text>< pics>

I was stationed at the Marine Corps Base for the last 2.5 yrs.  I live in San Diego, and I elected to buy a used RV and live on the Base RV Park vs. get an apartment.   I have never owned an RV in my life.  I bought a used 07 Class A Fleetwood.  Over the course of the 2.5 yrs I lived there, RV Depot saved me time and time again.  Over the course of my time there I had an AC go out the first summer, then the other go out the second summer,  my public power source caught on fire, my power inlet on the coach shorted out, eventually my levelers gave out and I broke the shower handle.  Every time,  RV Depot/ Vince and his crew, were ON THE SPOT, they came on base and made repairs to my "home" with reasonable prices and both of the AC's they replaced still work today.  It's one thing to have an RV, it's another to live in it.  RV Depot was a lifesaver.  I would recommend them to anyone.  I truly would have not made it out there if not for RV Depot!  I'm now retired and back in San Diego.   Thank you, Vince and RV Depot!!   Sincerely Frank Percy, LCDR, (RET)</Review>

Nothing but great things to say about RV Depot and the services they provide!!! Vince and Kim are a pleasure to work with and have always treated me in a very professionally and friendly way.

I recently purchased my 2013 Outback from a major RV dealer in Orange County.  That major dealer serviced it for me earlier this year.  I needed some other maintenance work done on my coach and Vince noticed the O.C. dealer never packed the wheel bearings I was charged $500.00 for.  I was able to get a refund from the major dealer but best of all my wheels didn't fall off on our following vacations.  We were safe thanks to RV Depot!

I will never go back to the dealer again.  Vince is super knowledgeable about RV's and is always eager to please.  Pricing is very reasonable and more than fair.  He just sold me and put 4 new high quality tires on. I was expecting to pay much more and was so surprised at the low price I told him to add on another  $100.00.  He smiled and respectfully turned down my offer.  As a business owner myself, Vince displays the same honesty and integrity I portray in my business.  I consider him a close Friend now and find having work done on my trailer a very pleasurable experience.

Thank you Vince, Kim and the rest of the team.  See you on next visit!<//Text>

< review>
My husband and I had just moved back to 29 on a Saturday and our ac went out on us, just completely died. I was trying to go through another business but they were not on top of it. By the time Tuesday afternoon had rolled around it still hadn't gotten fixed. I finally saw one of rv depots vans so I decided to give them a call to see when they could do it. I wish that I had dealt with them from the beginning. Kim was so helpful and friendly, she called Vince and told him what was going on while was on the phone with her and she said he would give me a call back to give me better in-site to what they could do. He called me back within a half hour! I was so impressed because the other place I had to call 5 times on Tuesday with no one getting back to me. When he has explaining to me what he thought it was, he said he would call around to find a unit for us. Again he called me back within the hour and said he had found one but wanted to make sure I wanted it to be replaced because the drive was 2 and half hours round trip. This was at 4 in the afternoon and he didn't care that it would have him working late, as long as we could have our air fixed. Vince and Austin came out the NEXT DAY and had it completely replaced. Then we had a breaker/converter problem going on and he came back to check it out. Once we thought we had it figured out, he still proceeded to call me to check up on us and the air. The way that Vince and Kim handled their business is hands down one of the best places I have ever dealt with. I HIGHLY recommend to have your work done through rv depot. You can always expect honesty, integrity, efficiency, and a friendly environment. The way they helped us made it feel like I was family they were helping. Thank you so much for all that you did for me and my family Vince!<//review>

Owners a crook! Reporting This business to BBB! Was given a quote and was charged extra labor costs without notification first! Was told my toilet had to be replaced and would cost $200 for a toilet and 2 hours labor at $118 a hour! All it needed was a gasket and a valve! Cost me $20 and 30 minutes! Charged me an extra hours labor to go online and find a part!  People beware!< /Text>

<Text>They always get my order wrong! I love sweet and sour Chicken. That is what I order, 4 times out of 5 I get Pork! I don't like sweet and sour pork. The sign days check your order no returns after it leaves the restaurant.  Well it's really hard to tell the difference unless u bite into it. Last time we tried to check our order at the counter before we left she kept waving us away saying goodbye, goodbye. Plus the food just doesn't taste as good as it used to. Sorry but you won't get my business anymore too many wrong orders without it being fixed☹👎I do not recommend, don't waste your time.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Worst orange chicken we’ve ever had.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was bought from a local store and microwaved.
honestly NOT worth the money :/

Ordered the family style dinner. Turned out to be way more food than we needed. It was delicious, I'm not a fan of their pork though. What's delicious was their sesame deep fried tofu.  Yum!</review>

I went to have lunch this afternoon, two and a half hours after they “opened” and the doors were locked. I had to walk all the way home, hungry. Is this place permanently closed and no one bothered to update?</Review>

Ordered orange chicken and it was anything but still cannot figure out what it was it was like eating mystery meat. I would not recommend eating here. Food tasted reheated. In the rice just had frozen veggies. And the food was very bland. But the Szechuan beef was not too bad. I gave it one star for the Szechuan beef!<//Text>

Very disappointed with our meal tonight. Im not sure what we were given,  but it certainly wasn't what we ordered. I think worse by far is this random container of uncooked vegetables with decent bits of chicken. Not sure why it was given to us,  just wish it'd been cooked since it's kinda gross raw.< /text>

Let me preface this with I am Chinese, travelled to 39 countries and have eaten Chinese food in many, many places. I saw the reviews on this site and let go of expectations for dinner. The "family style ma po tofu  with veggies" was rather flavorless with the frozen trio (corn, peas, carrots); we looked for chili pepper sauce. The Szechuan eggplant was rather tasty minus any semblance to Szechuan flavors. With added chili sauce, black pepper and salt, these two hot, gooey dishes warmed and satiated us on a cold night. Plenty of left over, too.
The server reminded me of my grumpy teens; it was sort of comical. She was attending to both the restaurant AND bar; that's a lot on a little lady with 4-5 tables to serve, concurrently. Kudos to her. One thumbs up for the experience.
Took left overs back to the inn and my teens wouldn't eat more than a bite. They rather microwaved their instant noodle bowls instead. Hehe. Thumbs down from them for all 3 items, even the rice.

The pu'er (?) tea was drinkable but truly poor quality. Serving plates, a mish mash of styles, need work. Poor presentation.
Definitely not a place for discriminating taste. Hope this helps.< /review>

Great food and service, but only one person working the tables. We had chow main and fried rice and it tasted clean and really delicious. Definitely give them a try... the bad reviews they have must be from a long time ago because we’ve never had a bad experience or bad food.< /Text>

<Review>The chicken tasted like frozen food heated up, with no flavor. The fried rice and chow mein had no flavor whatsoever. Pretty disappointing...</Review><user_id>117178975214870026107<//user_id><rating>1<//rating>< Time>

The reviews on this site kept us from checking out this place year after year… We decided to go check it out because we were craving Chinese food and it was the freshest, best food we had eaten in a long time. If you’re just looking at the reviews, go check it out for yourself! It’s soooo good. We got the veggie fried rice and veggie chow mein... YUM!!🌟🌟🌟🌟</Review>

< Review>
Great food, especially the chop suey! Only suggestion would be to not use the flowery air freshener that often sprayed on one area. Once we moved it was a perfect meal.< /Review>

<Review>Food was terrible. The lady there was rude and in a rush, even ended up snapping at me when I was giving her the order saying “That’s enough, you have ordered too much” and it was SO hot and stuffy in there.
Thank god I won’t ever return to this place.</Review><rating>1</rating><response>None<//response>< pictures>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>The price is decent, the service was prompt, but the food was sooo bland. I mean kung pow beef had no pow at all. Orange chicken was bland. Vegetable fried rice needed a bucket of soy sauce just to give it flavor. Maybe it's because I live in a small town and people aren't used to wild flavor that true Asian food gives, but this place could use more of it. I can make better Asian food at home. The only thing that was decent was the hot and sour soup.<//text><user_id>112453027351279491616</user_id>< gmap_id>

Friendly service and yummy food. The dinner special is a great deal. We usually can't eat everything on our plates. Always a comfort to have Chinese food in town at Lai Lai's. And they dont use msg to make it taste so good it's just yummy cooking.<//Text>

<text>On a to-go order, found the order to be wrong when I got home.   When I called them and they told me I had the correct order, that's how they make that dish and I was wrong. I explained that I orderd the same thing last week and this is the wrong order. They insisted they gave me the right order. You have lost one customer. The Thai food is better anyway.</text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Service was great, but this was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. Only had a couple bites and couldn't eat any more. We drove all the way to Yreka to get good Chinese food after leaving this place. We should have listened to the reviews!</review>

<Text>The food was the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I got the Orange chicken, and barely ate any. Not only was it disgusting, but it was also $14 for an order of Orange chicken and a drink. If I could give it 0 stars I would.  DO NOT GO HERE</Text>< pics>

This place is worth eating at if you are on a tight budget. The food is mediocre at best and the ingredients aren't   the freshest but there are extra savings on the senior's menu and the people are very sweet.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) A disgusting food ... No meat is very bad, many ingredients are missing in Mongolian meat ... ... In addition to the super bad attention zero empathy ... We were treated badly ... What a shame that one pay for something expensive and quality and make fun of yourself in this way ... I leave my experience so that they pay for this

(Original)
Un asco de comida... Nada de carne es muy malo faltan muchos ingredientes en la carne mongoliana.... ... A demás la atención super mala cero empatia... Nos atendieron de mala forma... Que pena que uno pague por algo caro y de calidad y lñse burlen de esta forma... Le dejo mi experiencia para que paguen por esto<//review><UserId.>117958397966531706059< /UserId.>< Time>

Terrible service. Went in for what should have been an easy fix. He says he installed a used part. Within minutes of driving out the check engine light came on. Went back Frank had the car for two weeks. I would call every other day for an update and they would tell me they would call back to give me one... never did. The last time I called for an update he put me on hold for 20 minutes and hung up.  I asked for the car back and a refund and the the old parts that were replaced. He said he didnt have the old parts. I dont think he did any repair to the car.<//Review>

From the first call, the guy knew what he was talking about and he knew what I was talking about. Just by talking to me a few extra minutes, made me feel comfortable that this was a good place I had picked. As long as I’m in the area, you guys have a customer for life. I’ll definitely tell my friends and family about this place. Thank you so much for taking care of my car the way I would.   100% in customer service and 100% in labor service. Thanks guys!!!!

They don’t hide behind the door and tell you this and that. They’ll tell you straight to your face with shoulders front and tell you what’s going on. They won’t scam you out of a warranty their prices are unbeatable and their personality has my respect. Thank you so much I can’t thank you guys enough.< /Review>< Pictures>

Frank's Auto is the best shop out here in Lancaster. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. They are honest and they help you out with whatever you need. The customer service is great. I had went to another shop before I found Frank's auto. Lets just say I wish I had gone to Frank's first. I will be coming here most definitely in the future. I wouldn't go to anyone else.</Review>

Great  service. They really take care of there customers. I am very happy I found a repair shop and great mechanics. Franks repair took care of our transmission and it ran great, now they have fixed the problems with my other car. I am happy to call them my mechanics and am referring them to anyone that needs a good honest mechanic. Thank you Franks!< /text>

<text>Went there for a re-built transmission.  It should only have taken the most time to fix would be 3 weeks, right?  No,...we had to literally take it back over a period of 3 MONTHS,....7 times for FRANK'S  to get it right!!!
I gave them a 1 Star for not admitting that they weren't able to admit from the beginning that they were incompetent in putting in a simple TRANSMISSION into a 2006 GMC/ACADIA!!
I guess that's what we get for trying to save a little money & not going to our regular auto shop repair that we've used for all of our vehicle's and never had any issues on any repairs in the 10 years we've gone there.</text>< Resp>

<Review>Franks transmission is by far the best. They fixed my alternator on my Cadillac.  They gave me a good price, fast service so I can get back to work and most of all excellent customer service.  I  will return in the future.

I brought my car here many years ago because I was looking for a mechanic I can trust. My car was running very weak and I was told it was because I had bad fuel injectors. He charged me I don't remember exactly I think it was like 1200 I gave him half cash upfront stupid of me. Well anyways they take my car apart put it a side in the back of there shop like a none priority, leave hood up wide open, windows down in the rain. Not good that will cause all sorts of damages. Not to mention cats will go in and pee in it. So they had my car at their shop neglected for like a month. When they finally finished it I went for a test drive with Frank, and the car ran exactly the same way I brought it. At this point I pay him the remaining balance for a no difference result. I drove it for a month after and my transmission went out. So I think my original problem was my transmission, not my fuel injectors I don't know. When I would come by the office to speak to them about the status of my car, I don't think he liked me complaining about the way he was handling my car. I was speaking with his wife about the situation and I caught him giving me a crooked look. I don't trust this mechanic shop I can get my fuel injectors changed for 300 dollars now. Or change them myself. Inconvenient, dishonest, rip off,careless<//review>

I have a piece of mine dealing with Frank.
Whenever I need my truck repaired this is the shop for me. I even got qualified for credit.
How easy is that?
Like I said a piece of mine. Thank You!

I was recommended to Frank and his shop over a yr ago and not only did he tell me what needed to be replaced he physically showed me the damaged parts. I had a issue last week coming home from camping. I dropped the truck off Tuesday morning and had it back friday night and even though the transmission was just out of his one year warranty he honored his warranty and work. He went above and beyond to even get the upgraded  parts that is a common failure on my transmission to insure no further issues in the future and at no extra charge to me. I would recommend everyone to his shop. It's hard to find a honest shop in the AV theses days and franks transmission is definitely a honest shop you can trust< /Text>

I've been going to Frank for about 5 years and he is a delight. He is friendly and respectful. Since I'm a woman it's hard to find mechanics that help and not take advantage of lack of knowledge. He's reasonably priced and efficient.< /Review>

My experience here was great, who would have thought my automatic transmission had a clutch system in it, wow ford!, they figured out the problem and solved and fixed it within a timely matter. Any major repairs id bring your vehicle to Frank's. Good quality service and customer service! Thanks Frank. -Justin Jenkins</Review>

<review>This place is a total rip off he must have paid somebody to write him good reviews definitely. I was quoted at $600 3 months later after he gave me every excuse under the sun why everyone I'd call the price went up. In the end i payed $1,600 only one gear was bad and it still wasn't right my 4 wheel drive didnt work...the guys cook and shouldn't be in business< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I'm so glad I took a chance and took my car to Frank. Believe the reviews because he and his team did an amazing job with my car. They identified the problem with the suspension in my car and it needed the frame and lower arm controls replaced. He also replaced the tire on my car because it was worn out. What I liked best was the service, he really takes you step by step of the process and explains everything and tries to get the job done as quick as possible. I felt comfortable leaving my car in his hands and thats saying something, because I've had my share of crooked mechanics.<//review>

Deceitful, Con, dishonest, high priced, shade-tree mechanic. I would definitely not recommend this shop or any work that Frank does to anyone. I had my transmission rebuilt here about 3 years ago. The same week after I paid and picked up my vehicle I was having issues. After going back several times, I took it to another mechanic and later to the Lexus dealer, both informed the work which was done by Frank was substandard and not complete. How could I have known this, I trusted that he would do his job well and I would pay the price he asked. I ran into another person who informed they had the same type of  dissatisfaction but didn't post. So my post is late but I thought it be best to post a warning now (late) rather than never.</Text>

<Text>Frank is a cool dude. He's definitely been in the business for longer than I've been on this earth. He opened up my transmission and told me exactly what had gone wrong and why he wouldn't be able to rebuild it, so he did his best to find me another used transmission. Uppon inspecting the new to us trans, he found that it was also no good. He took it upon himself to do a full rebuild using my original casing and got me back on the road. Not without delays, but, it was only when he was waiting on parts and even then he kept me up to date. 15/10 service. Im definitely taking the jobs I cant handle straight to him.</Text></record>

<GmapID>0x80c25ab1b77901df:0x642d0b5ddf860248< /GmapID><Text>Have used Franks auto service a few times and felt he was reasonable and honest. He did my oil for $10 when I provided the parts. Paid $120 for a tranny flush which was reasonable. But, the other day he quoted $350 to replace my brake booster, master cylinder and bleed the brake system. I felt that was very high when I was providing all the parts. Also, he kept my vehicle over night and did not call to inform me.  When I called around 2pm for status the next day he left me on hold for 15 minutes. Then his son finally answered and told me that it will be $350 even with parts provided. When I went there too talk to them they refused to detail how many hours it will take and what exactly I was paying in labor fees. His son just kept saying he doesn't know how many hours it would take. His ignorance to that fact surprised me so I called 5 different places for comparison. The highest quote was $130 cheaper then Frank, the lowest was $230 cheaper. Took it to the cheapest and they were done in 2 hours. BTW, brakes are wonderful and never felt better. Not going to say Frank is a bad mechanic. I only went there to have my oil changes done because I was to lazy to do it myself. Because of Franks outrageous quote it forced me to look elsewhere and I was lucky to find another very qualified, customer oriented auto repair business. If you need an oil change or a tranny flush Frank can help you, if you need anything more serious, I recommend you look elsewhere.</Text><Rating>2< /Rating>< username>

<text>He was supposed to do a oil change and some other work for me. He returned  the car back to me without doing the oil change. The car had a new problem of running hot. Frank himself did not do the work he had a young mechanic fresh out of trade school. He should have checked  his work not professional! Prices are a bit high also.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Very unprofessional, they're rude and they rip you off by cutting corners. Transmission doesn't last. Don't waste your money on them, so as it turns out he ended taking money then burning the customers and argues with everyone. DONT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR MONEY. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED< /Text>

{'time': 1529438103465, 'text': "Hello. Mr. Richard Gomez, it is unprofessional from your side giving this kind of review to accredited business. First point you are not out client at all, there is no way for you know who we are. Hard workers like you, that preform auto repairs from home are respectable if they are doing it in a professional way. But in this case, you mess up the transmission that we repaired for our client Mr. Joseph at time of installation. Second point we fixed the damages done by you, at no extra charge for Mr. Joseph and our warranties are good we are the only auto shop in Lancaster CA that is a CERTIFIED AUTO REPAIR with Nation Wide Warranties. We always look up for our customers. All reviews are welcome, reviews make us better, Ultimately, you have every right to leave a bad review, if you act in good faith and don't lie. The difference between a legal negative review and an illegal one comes down to libel in many cases as defamation."}< /Response>

Our sales woman Amanda S. Was great. We explained what we were looking for and she walked us right to it. The purchasing part went smoothly and quickly. We weren’t there for an entire day-it went very quick!

They have a great 50% off deal right now which made our couch affordable. She was up front and honest about the shipping ETA being unknown right now due to Covid and we have experience with other companies not being so honest. Overall it was a great experience.</Text>

The store employee,  Tran, was very attentive and very helpful in my search for a dresser. I was able to get in and out with making my purchase.  I appreciate his knowledge and courteousness.  I already know the furniture is very well made and reasonably priced. Unlike some furniture stores, American Furniture is very dependable for delivery and in financing if needed.< /Review>

<review>Had a wide variety of items to choose from. I bought a table and chairs, some wall art and a message chair.  The 45% off sale and no tax saved me lots of cash. I also made an offer on an item and saved almost $900 dollars. The staff was friendly, helpful and professional.< /review>< username>

Amanda is amazing!  She is so helpful and friendly and made me feel very comfortable purchasing my first piece of furniture.  The store itself is very clean, and inviting, and everyone is happy to help.  I'm already thinking about coming back and purchasing furniture from here again in the future.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>After visiting three stores looking for a couch with absolutely no assistance, walking into American Furniture Galleries was a breath of fresh air.
Patrick was extremely Pleasant, personable, knowledgeable and respectful. He greeted us within one minute of entering the store, after telling him what I was looking for, he promptly took me to several options. Knowing his inventory made the purchase much easier. We were literally paying for our items within 5 minutes of being in the store.
My entire experience was amazing. The store was extremely clean, the customer service was amazing and the price was just what I was looking for. Best customer service in town.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1608657127033, 'text': "We're glad you such a great experience.

Me my wife have gone several local stores for same, looking a set of furnitures. What is amazing on your store is the way you displayed everything . It made it easy for us look and locate what we wanted. Above all though is the young man who m we met the first time. He is extra ordinary human being. I wish him be happy in the business. Thank you for inviting me for my feed back.

Sincerely
Mulugeta<//Text>

<username>keith yarbrough< /username>< review>
Purchased a Guardian furniture insurance policy for $359 on our leather furniture set. Attempted to make a claim for a change in color on the lower seat and legs of the recliner, cause not sure. Coverage declined by Guardian with no opportunity to appeal. The photos sent clearly showed change in the leather color. I stated it happened just the week before. Went into American furniture to notify them on unsatisfied claim and they recommended Fibrenew to check the ability to help solve our damage. They clearly said it was damage caused by an accidental human body fluid stain. Why did this happen 4 years into our warranty? It then dawned on me I had a serious response to my Moderna shot of high fevers and chills with sweating for 2 days in that chair reclining. Attempted to reach out to guardian with expert witness update and again because of the time of the initial complaint I did not know what caused the stain and change of color they will not pay to fix. Asked to have their company send a representative out and they declined any further opportunity to remedy this claim.<//review>

Tony was very helpful and made sure I took advantage of the 50% deal they had going on today. I would definitely recommend coming here if you’re looking for quality furniture for a good price.<//review>

Amanda was very friendly and helpful from walking in to walking out with a table and hutch. There was no pressure at all to make a purchase and she made sure we found what we wanted. I will be going back to purchase more furniture in the future as they had a lot of great deals.</text>

We really enjoyed the smooth buying process, & Amanda was extremely helpful/personable! We looked the day before, & felt no pressure to buy from the sales reps. Shopped around a bit, but ultimately decided AFG was our best bet. Will update once our furniture is delivered.<//Text>

<Review>Great customer service from Amanda. She's patient, provides the options that I was looking for. One of my items was lost in the warehouse, she did her job, provided a refund and also offered to replace it with something else. We went back and spent a lot more money there. Their products have good quality, I'm a 3rd time customer of American Furniture Galleries.< /Review><date>1604805752856< /date></record>

<Text>Went in on a sunday very polite salesman welcoming you to American Furniture.  Asked my husband how were we, introduced himself to us. Said if we needed any assistance please let him know. It didn't take long for us before he came and asked what we were looking for. He was very helpful, described  everything, told us about their amazing deals. He even as about the space and size we were  looking for. Guess what I ended up buying a sofa & love seat as well as a dining room set at a great price it made my day! Thank-you American Furniture  for your wonderful  service!</Text>< Pics>

<Review>The sales people and everyone at American Furniture Galleries is always helpful without being pushy.  I have purchased most of my furniture there over the years and it's been a great, seamless experience every time.  Also their delivery cost is reasonable and each time I've been pleasantly surprised at how professional the delivery people have been.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x809ac7130d3f87a1:0xfa819c08e2f6aa06<//GmapID></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>We went down there to get furniture for my new room and the price that we were quoted included this. Including a giant mirror that came with the bedframe,  nightstand, and dresser. Well when all of the furniture came, the movers said that they didn’t have a mirror because there wasn't one quoted in our cost when we explained that we did in fact have it they sneakily told us to take it up with the manager who sided with them and told us that we didn’t include the mirror even though they charged us the extra $200 for the mirror.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>We bought a sectional Labor Day weekend. They had been running ads saying "Buy it today get it tonight." However we were told we would have to wait 4-6 weeks for our purchase. We paid in full up front. 4 weeks go by and I call to check on the status. Now they say it will take 4 MONTHS. By now we've missed all the Labor Day sales so most things are out of our budget. I asked if they would be willing to substitute a different set that might cost a little more and they refused. Poor customer service. go to RC Willy instead.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I had been in constant contact with my salesman, checking on the availability and letting him know when I would be there to purchase and pick up my items. I get all the way there to be told they sold all of the nightstands. Needless to say, I went from very excited about my new bedroom purchase, to very disappointed.  I bought one of the items, to avoid a wasted trip, but I will take my business elsewhere for all of my future purchases.</Review>

I came looking for the best I wanted the best and I got a very good deal for exactly what I was looking for he took care of me, he was very thorough took the time to check out every option for me. Tony was patient and helped me lay out all my options.  He was so bomb I cannot wait to purchase more furniture with him.

<review>I went shopping  for a specifically styled small table for two stools that was high enough for me to stand rob prepare meals and can serve as a dining table for two. I found it and am ecstatic!
The sales man was cordial, polite and helpful! If you want good value for furniture,I suggest you go to America Furniture Gallery

I went in today for a new mattress as well as see if there was a price change on something I bought a week or so ago. The rep that helped with the mattress was helpful until it came to see about the price change. He said he would go look at the furniture to see and then pawned me off on the the rep that helped last week and then that rep passed me off to a man named Sean and he was soooo nice and helpful he definitely saved the night because it definitely made me feel a type of way once they had my money for the mattress and kept passing mea off. It was something so simple didnt take much time.Thank you Sean!<//text>

I would say there is a zero stars on this place, I order a bed frame from this place, then they let me wait 2 months for delivery, it's fine, I understand the covid-19 made the delay. Finally I received my order today, I order from Aug. 2nd. it took 3 months, fine. But after I assemble everything, I just realizedI that, the bed frame is required a foundation, but the sell person didn't tell me that. Then I call, and ask why nobody told me when made the payment. The sells person said that I told him I have mattress, so I may have a box spring. What? Who tell you all bed frame must be need a foundation? Fine, I ask the guy how much for the foundation, then he told me 400 something, but now can give me a dicount on 299 and with I think like 99 delivery fee. WTH, this is your fault, and I need to pay for your mistake for the delivery fee and I don't have a bed for some night? Then the sells guy let me go to pick it up myself, and I asked can I pick up now? He said the warehouse already closed, I need to pick it tomorrow. Now I order from another place that cost me less than 200 with free delivery.<//Text>

Great prices !! Delivery is expected within 7 days.. Which is awesome.. Can't wait to get my furniture.. Amanda was my salesperson and the reason why i went back. She took the time to show me furniture and gave me ideas based on information i was giving her. I really appreciated the fact that she followed up with me.. Great customer service!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Patrick was great. Treated me like a valued customer even if it was just my first time. Tien was just such a lovely customer service rep. Patrick and Tien gave me the experience like I was at a super high end place despite me coming in looking scrubby, keep up the great work guys< /review>

Maria was very nice and accommodating. She greeted us but let us shop around without following us. Great sale and good selection of furniture. The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because I have to wait 2-3 weeks for my furniture.< /Text>

I would've loved to give 5 stars, however our salesperson failed to disclose we would need to give a deposit after we were approved for our financing. Also the initial final cost was lower than what was given to us.
I wanted to raise these issues with management, however my time was limited and I didn't want to frustrate the situation.

My hope is for the sales rep to do a better job at disclosing ALL cost and what's going to be needed up front, to that the next customer will be able to have a fair chance at making their purchase.</review>

Service we received at American Furniture Gallery 8001 E Stockton Sac, CA is unacceptable. I ordered furniture on Oct 6th and paid cash 6500, pay close attention to the order date Oct 6. Our house was under construction, they held the delivery per our request. Delivery was scheduled for Dec 1st. They didn't call day before to confirm delivery ahead of time,  instead we called.  John T. the salesman was in silent mode, mute all this time,  didn't hear anything about my order/delivery until Dec 1 when we received partial order. When the warehouse looked at my order on the day of delivery he made a decision for me again no calls letting  me know about missing items.  Someone thought something better than nothing.  We paid for delivery to Antioch, the guys started to unload,  installation started.  At the very end we asked about missing 3 items because I thought there was more to unload, that's when I was told some BS about the manufacture, blah blah blah. Warehouse person took it upon himself to deliver partial order, with no calls to me, he assumed partial delivery is better than no delivery.  That was my decision not his.  How can they f-up on an order placed 2 months ago? I called the store,  was put on eternal hold, these guys started to ignore me.  I drove from Antioch to Sac,  salesman John T. was ignoring my presence.  I spoke with Shawn,  the store manager which was no help, he kept apologizing but I don't care about sorry I want my furniture. Shawn gave me BS about 2 items were not the same color of the bed and couch was damaged.  Where were they for the last 2 months. They had plenty of time to fix this. Shawn refused to work with me,  his attitude was they can return the money and he will arrange pick up the furniture, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT which I couldn't do because accent walls were painted, things was purchased based on the couch color.  SHAWN THE MANAGER PUTS MY ORDER BACK IN LINE FOR "MAYBE" ETA OF DEC 14TH. TOTAL BS. SHAWN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK WITH ME, IT WAS TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. ONCE YOU PAY THEM THEY TAKE NO OWNERSHIP. SHAWN SAID IT'S EVERYONE ELSE'S FAULT NOT THEM.  ONCE AMERICAN FURNITURE GETS YOUR MONEY REST IS EVERYONE ELSE'S FAULT. DON'T BUY FROM THEM, YOU COULD GET THE SAME TREATMENT!!!!!<//text>

When I arrived I was greeted by the staff, They were extremely friendly! The one sale person Tony, stood out from the rest. Tony was knowledgeable and very patient. He helped me get my entire house furnished and stayed within my budget.  He didn’t make me feel pressed and even helped me finance most of the furniture. American Furniture will definitely be my go to place. Nice furniture at reasonable prices is always a win!</Text>

They had a a great sale going which I was hoping to score on a find. After playing the seek and find, I scored. Located Laura again and she was very helpful on setting everything up for me. She answered all my questions and I didn’t feel pressured into a sale. Great personality, which she fits the job. Thanks again Laura, my granddaughter has laid claim to the over size chair already from just the picture.
Have been shopping here for over 20 years and shall continue. The quality is always great.<//Review><Date>1572145392776< /Date></record>

He was very helpful and did all he could, ensuring everything was clearly explained about my items and how some of my items were back ordered. I would have given 5 stars only if the manufacturer company for the items I want didn't keep pushing my order back. I had to wait an additional 2 weeks from the original date I was informed to get my items. However, the in person experience with the store was easy and pleasant. I will  definitely consider going back if I want another furniture.<//review>< pictures>

<text>A positive experience overall, customer service if friendly and the gentleman who assisted us was knowledgeable and helpful. We found the piece that was a very good fit for us and we were able to complete the financing and transaction quickly.  We were able to schedule delivery for the next day and the truck arrived within the scheduled window for delivery. The only issue was the delivery team had quite a bit of difficulty removing one piece of the furniture that came packed inside the furniture itself. I was concerned that the piece would be damaged as they had a very had time getting it out.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1564528661078<//Time>< user_name>

Don was great, he came and checked on us and instantly wrote up numbers. We changed our mind about 3 times on the couches we wanted and he was not bothered by having to do the numbers on each set we were interested in. Don also was very friendly and assisted us well.

We now have our couches at home and they are the best couches we’ve ever had. Such a great deal too. My first set of couches was also purchased here and I’ll definitely be going back< /Text>

My first and last purchase from this place. Disappointed that as we get charge for the delivery services.  They can't meet our expectations for a timely manner delivery. There are so many other furniture businesses that do NOT charge their customers for delivering, and are able to make exceptions for their customers. Wow, by the way i see more then two reviews on here about the delivery service.  Thanks for all the heads up folks. Let's hope the delivery goes smoothly tomorrow.</Review>

<Review>I enjoy the friendly approach of the attendant. He presented a calm demeanor. He my likes according to my needs as presented i.e understood need to accomodate small space. He was considerate checking out items (saving from too much walking that tires me easily) he believed i would like before taking me to see it; example dining rm set found combo of wood, cloth,
n metal set.  Price was important as was quality, which he handled very well. His relaxed manner helped me to relax the whole time spent choosing what i was looking for took 30mins.  I love Patrick because he took time to listen to my need n went to work immediately to help me.  Thanks Pat<//Review>< Pictures>

The salesman was great and very knowledgeable! He was very attentive and able to answer all of our questions, and more! The bed set that he recommended for us was very durable and not like the ones we were originally aiming for before coming to the store! We actually spent more than we wanted to because of him! At first, we were focused on the lower-end-priced item but we were persuaded by him to buy a much more expensive bed set.  He showed us the difference in the quality of the items and the prices. He was really knowledgeable and attentive.  He should definitely get a raise for the holiday!!!!! We are having it delivered so we’ll wait and see!<//review>

< Review>
Purchased a nice looking marble dining table (very heavy) with 6 chairs, along with a microfiber sofa & loveseat. All items were poorly made. Table legs were cheap wood, Chairs looked nice but were uncomfortable to sit on after about 2-3 months. The springs were felt under the thin foam padding. No bueno.

The sofa and loveseat has a sharp wood piece that hurt many of our family and friends tailbone when the sat down. The first thing they ask is “where did you get this furniture”? Of course we told everyone where It was from! How embarrassing. 🤦🏼

Also note, no matter how much money you spend there, they won’t deliver for free. Some other furniture places will do free delivery if you buy up to a certain amount. Not this place. We won’t be returning. 🙅🏼< /Review>

< review>
I had a great experience with American Furniture.  After deciding that I was going to purchase a sectional couch, I shopped all the various furniture stores and discount warehouses.  I found just what I was looking for among the most diverse selections in the area.  American Furniture's showroom was clean and well organized.  American Furniture had quality furniture made with compatibly the best materials and construction.  Best of all their low prices and finance options were also great. I had initially found the sectional I wanted on sale, but was unable to make the purchase before the advertised sale ended.  Luckily Vincent, my sales assistant remembered me from my initial visit and was able to get me the sales price.  Great guy, I recommend him to all my friends and will contact him for my next purchase.  The only reason I was unable to give a 5 star rating was because after purchasing, I was informed one of the sections of my sectional had to be back ordered and would arrive a little late.  Vincent contacted me as soon as he found out, and sincerely apologized.  The section should arrive w/in the week, and I would definitely shop American Furniture again.< /review>

Great customer service and good quality sectional couch and chair at a good price. Definitely a great place to buy good furniture.

They, Mohammed and Roberto, delivered our new sectional and chair today. We had a window between 10:00 and 2:00 and they were there at 10:00 on the dot. They were nice and respectful. They helped us set up our new living room. We are very happy with our total American Furniture experience.<//Text>

<review>Beautiful sectional sofa with a chaise for an incredible deal. Minh was the first person that greeted me immediately and he provided the highest grade of customer and personable. He was also very communicative, friendly, was not pushy at all and allowed my wife and I to browse the entire store at ease. He kept me updated with all the sales and pricing going on. I really enjoyed seating going to other furniture stores and comparing their sofas to Americans Furniture Gallerias quality, but my final decision where to buy the couch was from American Furniture Galleries. The sofa that stole my heart and caught my eyes was located at this very store. The sofa had a nice medium firmness when you sit on it, and fabric was very soft to the skin. The material was very high quality and had that exact contemporary I was going for. It’s a very exiting piece and has tons of neutral tones on the fabric itself and stitching on the sofa was seamless and no imperfections was found. I also love how the chaise was long and wide enough to fit two people. My first impression was a well made sofa made out of high quality material and craftsmanship was on point. I didn’t came back just for the beautifully crafted made in USA furniture, but for the customer service I was provided from my initial day of walking into the store and towards the end of my final decision and making this purchase. This furniture even delivers and will set up your furniture for you for a great deal. Thank you Minh for providing 5 stars customer service, being understanding and flexible of my budget and Americans Furniture Galleries for helping me fill my dream home was a beautiful piece of furniture that can be appreciated. Can’t wait until our next purchase from this furniture store! *two thumbs up* Recommend this place if you’re looking for any well made home furniture.

< Review>
My review is based on the customer service manager Maria.
I had an issue with the living room set that i bought 4 years ago. The fabric was unraveling and the frame had issues and my insurance warranty said my claim was denied due to it was a manufactures defect.

I called the store and Maria sent someone to do an inspection.
Maria called me back and said to give her sometime and she would try to work with the manufacture and see what she can do.
I have been updated buy text on the progress of case.

Maria called me and said she had been able to work with the manufacture and they agreed for a re selection of a new living room set.

I came in picked out my new living room and it has been delivered with no problems. The delivery crew although they did not speak good  English did a great job. They took all trash with them. I tried to give them a tip and they did not accept it.

My experience with American Furniture Gallery  has been a good one.
They have a great Customer service manager who helps out her customers.
Their delivery team is also very hardworking and get things done.

In the future we will always come back and purchase here.
I will definitely be referring to all my family and friends.<//Review>

<Review>Had an issue with a mattress failure. I contacted then for a warranty evaluation. An appointment was scheduled for three weeks later for a five minute appointment! Then it was 15 working days before there was a response from the manufacturer. It was determined that the mattress had failed.  It was three years old and prorated in value.

I went in to order a new mattress and it is not in stock in their warehouse. Go figure.  Another; yes, you guessed it,  three weeks before I get a replacement.  Not sure if this an industry standard, but not to happy. Only reason I didn't give one star is they did a fair job keeping me informed.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
They have 20 to 50% off right now. The funny thing is is there is a sign saying something about a moving sale but when I asked about it, one of the associates said they're not actually moving it's just to bring more people in. LOL. Wow. Great way to lie to the customers to bring them in. Isn't that considered false advertisement?. Makes me wonder if they marked up prices before they did the sale so that way they're still making good money.. Even with that said they do have some nice furniture and some of the prices are not that bad, but still....🤔😉</review>

Laura was great in helping me find the right furniture that fit my needs/design. She made sure to tell me the key points of the product, promotions, and sales, but also gave me time to wander around the store on my own. My needs were met and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Great customer service and personable.< /Text>

Terrific no-pressure sales person John helped us identify the right options for our quality bedroom set. The price was competitive too. When we were ready to purchase a couple days later, we found John and he processed our purchase in less than 15 minutes and even offered delivery of all items two (2) days later!

Wow - keep up the great work.<//text>

I went in to find a recliner during their 40% off sale. Imagine my surprise when I see that all their stuff is marked up so that the 40% off puts it right back to regular price. Very shady and disappointing. If you are going to have a sale, then make it a real one...not a fake one to draw in customers. I've bought several pieces of furniture from them in the past, but I may be done with them at this point. The 2 star rating is because they do have attentive sales people.</text>

<user_name>Lisa Silvia< /user_name><time>1561519900468</time><Text>I had a very difficult time dealing with American Furniture Galleries. If I could leave them zero stars, I would. I placed my order on 5/23/19, to be delivered on 6/3/19. Upon delivery, the headboard I ordered was damaged. The delivery guys took it back, but because they did not have another in stock, I was very rudely told by the customer service manager that the manufacturer had 10 business days to SHIP a new headboard, leaving us waiting until 6/18. I was told at that point, that I would be contacted for a new delivery date. I waited until 6/20 and still was not contacted so (again) I called to find out what the status of my order was. I was told there was no information on my order, so I asked for a manager to call me back with information. Hours later, a manager called my husband and the headboard was FINALLY delivered on 6/22. I will never purchase ANYTHING from this company again. I would recommend that others save themselves the headache, and purchase furniture from a company that values customer service.</Text>< Rate>

My wife and I were looking for a dining table set.  We have visited other stores but American Furniture had the best price.  We were greeted with a smile and the gentleman who helped us was very friendly.  The table we wanted was not available in that store but they got one for us from another store.  The only reason why I gave it a 2-star is because the guys who assembled the table didn't do a good job.  A few of the slabs on the table were not straight and I had to take the table apart to re-do the table.</text>

<review>This review is based on my own personal experience with a sales associate who i will never ask for in the future by the name of John .
My mother who is of Mexican decent and knows very little English. My mother requested a Spanish speaking sales person to better communicate and was told that no Spanish speaker was available that day. However to our surprise we were walking around and overheard another sales associate speaking Spanish with another customer. Hummm  i turn and tell my mom i thought he said no Spanish speaker was here today?

My experience with the  layout of the furniture is very nice and beautiful decorations. However it can be a little confusion when the tags are a little hard to read based on some thing have 30% off some have 40% and some are 50% off. Some have tax and some the tax are all included so a little overwhelming.

My experience  with John  was not pleasant at all. John tried to sell my mother on the finance with no credit check no credit needed.
But he forgot to mention that a down payment was required and a checking account.  Stuff that if we were told from the upfront we wouldn't have wasted all that time their.
We ended up leaving and then coming back another day and asked for a Spanish sales and aging was told no Spanish sales was working however Sam our new sales associate did bring out a lady by the name of Maria who  works in the office and she explained the credit program to my mother and got her approved for the loan in her own language.
The quality of the furniture is great, the time between purchasing and getting our delivery was no lie the next day.
I can overall say that the price, the quality and service was great just what makes American Furniture not get 5 Stars is John because of being greedy or just not wanting to assist my Mothers needs with making our house look beautiful.</review>< rating>

< Review>
I walked in a bit lost as I didn't know what to expect especially shopping for my bed... The employee approached me and was very friendly,  he asked the necessary questions about my needs and directed me to the section where the mattresses are located,  there he had me try out the bed and let me take my time to feel comfortable enough to see if it would work for me. I was happy but skeptical I tried a few more beds,  he was not rushing me but patient... Once I was able to compare the comforts I was happy to make my purchase. Thank you Minh for everything! Id definitely go back.< /Review>

I walked in to find new furniture for my new home. . Amanda was very helpful to me as I wasn’t sure if I wanted a sectional or couch love seat combo. She patiently walked me around the store and showed me various ideas and I finally decided on a beautiful leather reclining couch. And better yet it was on sale for 4th of July. I not only found the perfect living room set but a new bedroom set as well. I can’t thank Amanda enough for her kindness and intuitive heart to guided me through finding the perfect new furniture for my new home.<//text>

Salesman Jason is truly amazing. He goes above and beyond for you to make sure you get what you want and need. I ordered a sectional last week that ended up not fitting in my home so I had to go back yesterday and pick out something else. I was so stressed out about it and Jason helped me pick out a new sofa set in my budget and helped me with financing. His patience and kindness was really amazing and I will be back in the future to cross things off my wish list! Thank you!<//Text>

I was really impressed with the sales lady who was very professional and pleasant. She answered all my questions before I even asked. The only thing I am not really happy about is that I am being charged $100.00 for shipping when I live a half mile down the street from the store. The reason I bring it up because I thought if I went shopping close to home the shipping wouldn’t be that much. I was scheduled for delivery on Saturday but something happened now I have to change my plans because the delivery is changed to Sunday. I am not blaming the sales lady because of how she treated me is the reason I purchased my order. I always thought that if a store caused a problem that they would at least offer a discount or free shipping but I guess that’s only a business that puts customers service over their profit.<//Text>

John was our salesman and he was very nice and did not make us feel pressure! Every one was so pleasant and friendly! We liked what we saw but wanted to think and talk about it. So we told him we would be back the next day. But we did not get back until the following day.We have trouble walking but they were very patient and we cotinued looking. And finally made a dicision  and  we  are very happy! The guys that delivered and set everything up were so great and patient with my grand children who happen to show up at the same time! Very happy with this experience! Thank you!< /text>

<Date>1537482165013</Date><UserId.>104571961552590591162</UserId.><rate>5<//rate><review>I came  in and purchased from James who sold me a bed in queen size, however he did not know his product well that the bed rails were a lot more slim than a king size displayed on the floor. If James would of informed me of that i  would have not purchased.

The bed room set got delivered and that is when we found out about the rails. I immediately contacted the store and spoke to James who did not have a clue of what i was talking about. He transferred me to Maria in customer service who calmed me down and told me she would try to work with the manufacture and see if the CK rails or EK rails would work  with the queen set i have. Maria sent her delivery staff and tried to make rails work however it did not work.
Sean and Maria both were very helpful they took back the bed set and refunded the monies to Wells Fargo bank.
I will be back to to purchase another bed set in the future just have to find the right set that works with current pieces that i currently have in my room.
The return procedure was easier than i thought. After reading their store policy it said that we would be charged a 25% restocking fee.Which  i discussed with my husband and we did not like any other bedroom set in the store. However after talking to Maria and we explained our situation she agreed to cancel our order, she said she wanted me to be happy and that right their is great customer service in any language .<//review><Response>{'time': 1537484402242, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback, and for recognizing our management team and their  efforts to provide you first class service.

Excellent experience! My only issue was the dinette set that I purchased for $199 went on sale this week for $168. I made my purchase a week too soon. I would highly recommend this store.</Text>

<Text>We bought a sectional sofa on November 25, 2018.  It is now December 14, and we still have not received the sofa.  The delivery men finally arrived on December 19 and did not do a good job assembling the sofa.  They neglected to plug in some of the cords so the controls did not work properly.  We had to disassemble the sections to get to the cords.  At age 74, re-assembling the sectional was very difficult; we had to call a friend to help.  On a good note, the saleslady, Camilla, was very nice and helpful; very professional.</Text>< Pictures>

Salesman Jason is truly amazing. He goes above and beyond for you to make sure you get what you want and need. I ordered a sectional last week that ended up not fitting in my home so I had to go back yesterday and pick out something else. I was so stressed out about it and Jason helped me pick out a new sofa set in my budget and helped me with financing. His patience and kindness was really amazing and I will be back in the future to cross things off my wish list! Thank you!</text>

< review>
When we were at the price negotiation, we felt a little pressured and didn’t feel reasonable about the price. Salesmen mentioned about his extra effort of coming out to work for me. I do value his time and I thank him for that, but does that mean my time is not valuable? I work a 8 hour schedule and I came right after work. I expect business to be done. I continuously contacted the same salesmen for appointment service because I wanted to bring my business here. I was able to find a much better deal somewhere else and they never once made me felt pressured.<//review>

I really had a good experience here they have definitely better deals than furniture USA. Minh was super helpful and friendly at the store and accommodated our delivery 2 weeks out until our home was ready which we really appreciated. However the delivery guys called 2 hours ahead before delivery and one of them let my couch drop on the floor which was very odd. Good thing was that the couches were nicely wrapped up in plastic so there was no damage but the delivery guys should be more careful and work together to get the furniture in the house undamaged. Other than that I have an overall good experience will definitely shop here again in the future.<//review>

<Review>We came to this location because we were extremely displeased with the Auburn Blvd location and how we were treated. Patrick was nothing short of amazing, he spent time helping us decide on our new sofa set and made sure we were happy with our choice. His no pressure approach definitely made us comfortable in buying from them - the manager Shaun came out to greet us and was just as friendly. When you feel like your business is valued you want to come back. Thanks guys .<//Review>< Date>

< review>
Store has a lot of computer/system issues with ordering and had to give our credit card information to another store by phone which doesn't feel secure. Also had a horrible experience with delivery 2 out of 2 deliveries were messed up. Don't buy from this store!

We bought two mattresses a king and a twin the twin was to be delivered the following day  after purchasing which was a Thursday. However, we got a call from the store saying that their system was down and they were unable to schedule our next day delivery so we rescheduled delivery for Friday instead. But come Thursday morning and the delivery driver calls us and says he is almost at our home. We said we were supposed to have already rescheduled to Friday but he says he never got the memo so we rush home to meet the driver. Driver gets there and doesn't even know what items to drop off we agreed with the store that only the twin mattress was supposed to be delivered since the king rails and box spring we're to be delivered with the king mattress the following week.

Come the following week and we get a call on Monday saying our king mattress, rails and boxspring are to be delivered on Thursday from 10-2. So we agree and stay home all day Thursday. At 1pm we call the store to see if the driver is still on their way since we never got another call. The store says they have nothing in their system about a delivery for us at all. We ask to speak to a manager and the salesperson says there is no manager. The store has no solution for the issue other than to schedule the delivery for the following day between 10-2 again! We had to struggle with the customer service to get the name of a manager and when they will be in. So here we are awaiting the manager to get in and call us back. I'll update this review if they have any way to fix the problem. Otherwise I don't recommend this store unless you are willing to sit and wait for them to get their act together!<//review>

We were very pleased when shopping and with our unique  shopping experience with american furniture Galleries.  We were very welcomed and had tip top knowledgeable service.  Eric was our salesman and took us through each process, explained warranties, delivery and  VIP 5 year cleaning and repair services which we purchased for a minimal cost.  Our entire purchase from beginning to end was fabulous
and prompt.  Eric even walked us to the door and thanked us again.  It has been such a long
time since we had a competent sales person.
Thank you again Eric for your tip top friendly service.<//text>

<text>Happy with the service I received at the store  however, the delivery guys just dropped and ran. Cords and plugs were hanging out everywhere making trip hazards out of them. Switched lighting was unplugged from switched outlets and plugged into regular outlets to power the power sofa and loveseat. It would have been better if the delivery guys set the furniture and left the electrical alone. I had to troubleshoot what they did in order to put the lighting back the way it was.

I called and spoke with a salesman and he told me they had the 2pc sectional for $597 in stock, I rented a uhaul and went to purchase the sectional but the sales women looked it up and informed me it is -6 in stock, meaning it is in back ordered by that many customers, sales women informed all of this to the store manager and he said there is nothing he can do. I would have never rented a uhaul if they didn't have the sectional in. I will never purchase furniture from American Furniture Galleries again and will inform all of my facebook friends of this and for them to spread this to all of their friends.<//text>

Patrick listened closely to what we were looking for and showed us around. He lead us to couches that fit our criteria and gave us his honest opinion. Most importantly he didn't pressure us and helped us pick out the best couch configuration for our living room. Would definitely recommend American furniture galleries and especially working with Patrick !!< /Text>

<review>We had a pretty good experience in-house and ordering our couch was fairly painless; however, no one told us that we needed to pick it up at the warehouse so when we arrived at the store, we were told we had to drive 30 minutes away.  Once we got there, they told us they would be closing in 30 minutes for an hour, so we had to speed back home to drop off the first load and go back for the second.</review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Their sales room staff gave us space to browse without stalking us through the store. Once we made up our mindsm they definitely showed some hustle. We got our table a couple of weeks sooner than we thought. They didn't over promise how fast it would get here. Their pricing was good and they were honest and forthright with how long their sale was running (unlike the sales person at RC Willie that flat out lied to us about a sale ending that day to try and force a sale). Their delivery system, when they were unable to reach my wife and I on the phone, defaulted to the earliest delivery time/date with the option to change it via text message.< /review>

I had a great experience. Went looking new coaches and they had a great selection. We were greeted at the door and pointed in the right direction. There was a great selection to choose from. The sales associate did not hover but was immediately available for our questions. Would strongly recommend.</review>

The delivery was right on time! Our sales person Minh was very helpful and very patient as we made our selection. Initially planning to shop at different stores, we purchased right on the spot. The quality of the furniture was our main motivation. The discounts were very generous as well!<//review>

< Review>
I came here last week when they had their parking lot sale ( outside).
I was approached many times and  asked if i needed  help. It was hard to determine who worked their because they have on hats to avoid the sun. I only purchased a chest on that day. I came back later in the week and made a purchase with Don C. He was very knowledgeable but did need help when it came down to getting me approved with no credit needed program.
Maria in Customer Service helped me get my loan approved and she was very knowledgeable with every question i had. She also speaks spanish which was a plus for me and my mother in law. Maria gave us the loan paperwork in spanish.
The service from Don C was a B
The store presentation was awesome i give it an A
The cleaness of the store and bathroom was an A
The service by Maria Customer Service Manager A
The exterior parking lot i give it a B
The music that is playing is so relaxing i give it a B+

Things that need improvement.
Your salesmen and women need to have color coordination shirts so that we the customer know who works their.

It would be nice to have a vending machine in my experience i have kids who get irritated when the process takes a long time also my mother in law needed to take medication and needs to be taken with food, luckily when i mentioned i needed to leave Maria gave my mother in law some crackers.<//Review>

<Review>The salesman was very helpful BUT the delivery guy was very very handsy. He asked to use my bathroom and asked a lot of very personal questions. He kept sending his buddy out to the truck so he was alone with me. It made me very uncomfortable. When he left he slapped me on the butt. I was dumbfounded.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I noticed something wrong with it and immediately called Don he informed me he was off but to call store and ask for Maria in customer service. I explained my problem and Maria immediately no questions asked said she could schedule them to bring out a new one on June 26th, 2019. I offered to show her pictures she said it was mot necessary. Today they delivered the new sofa and i am very pleased with the quality of service that was given to me. Don was excellent salesman, Maria in Customer Service was superb very pleasant experience which is hard to find in service, John the delivery driver was very careful with his delivery and asked for permission to come into my home.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1561668829957, 'text': 'Bee,Thank you for the 5 Star review we work very hard to make sure our staff has the proper tools to give our customers the best assistance possible.

<Text>Jason, the representative who helped us, explained the different options and assisted us throughout the whole process. The gallery is very clean, and professional. We bought a recliner set and dining set for 1700 with 39% off and no taxes. We love our new furniture which is built with quality and style as well as comfort. We are very happy customers and recommend American Furniture Galleries in Elk Grove, CA!

5 Days Later Update...2 out of 4 dining chairs broke and their system was down so about a week later I am still waiting on a call for them to schedule to bring in new replacement chairs. My recliners will be in 2 weeks after I bought them which is what they said it would be.</Text><Date>1527721420659</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>{'time': 1527376041200, 'text': 'Thank you for your positive feedback about your experience at one of our stores.

Amanda was our sales person. We went in to buy a mattress. She was very patient and knowledgeable about all of the mattresses. She knows the importance of choosing the right mattress for a good nights rest. We tired all of the firm mattresses out. we decided to buy the FIRM Simmons beauty rest with the pillow top. Before, my husband would wakeup 2-3 times a night, but on this new mattress, he sleeps through out the night now. I'd definitely will contact Amanda again for my new purchases.<//text>

Finally was able to schedule a delivery date, day before delivery received a call to reschedule for the following week. Stayed home all day waiting for delivery. I called near the end of the delivery window, was told crew was running late. Called again 2 hours after delivery window, was told AFG did not actually have my table and chairs. And that they could not be certain of a delivery date. But I could come in and pick out another table and chairs from the showroom. NO WAY, canceled my order and have gotten refund. I believe I was lied to in this process and will not return as a customer.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I went in to find myself a new sofa for my living room. The sales rep that helped me was super friendly and showed me around. They have a huge selection, and I found a very nice sofa. I had it delivered and the delivery team came the following week. They were quick and professional. I had a great experience and will be back again.

He showed us where the type of couch we were looking for would be, then gave us time to look, without hovering. He checked on us a couple of times, just to see how we were doing. He explained everything and answered our questions. There was absolutely no pressure at all! It was just what works for us from a sales person. I even ended up buying a dresser as well! I will definitely come back to buy more furniture when needed. Thank you for such a nice experience!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>We absolutely love the variety of furniture, as well as the great customer service. Unfortunately the manager Shawn is very rude and uncaring to his customers. My husband  had purchased $2200 worth of furniture on 3/2/19 with a delivery date of 3/4/19 at that time my daughter bed room set was not completely delivered she was missing her bed and mirror. The delivery driver said he can bring it the following day. Which never happened we reached out to Shawn asking him if we can get a 10% discount on are next purchase which was additional $1800 sale that we were planning on making. He stated no based on we received sale prices rudely he went on and on never apologized for the inconvenience. Now today date is 3/08/19 they finally arrived with my daughters bed and mirror but its broke so we still have to wait. I called the store and spoke to MARIA WOW SHE WENT OVER AND BEYOND TO CALL THE WAREHOUSE AND GET US ANOTHER DELIVERY FOR 3/9/19 MARIA WAS CARING OF ARE NEEDS AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE INCONVENIENCE THIS HAS CAUSED MY FAMILY AS WELL AS MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOMEONE TO BE HOME SINCE WE HAVE WORK. MARIA ACTED AS A MANAGER SHOULD HAVE. SHES ONLY CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT SHE SHOULD GIVE SHAWN THE S.M some Proper CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING. OVERALL I THANK THE STAFF. BUT SHAWN SHOULD NOT BE A MANAGER!!</Text>< Pictures>

I came in to buy a bed.  The salesman assured me that though the bed said medium firm, it really felt like a medium.  I laid on it, and it seemed okay.  The salesman wrote up my charges but failed to tell me there was absolutely no return policy.  When I first used the mattress, it felt like I was lying on a table.  A memory foam topper didn't help.  I hate the bed, but after reading the "fine print" I am stuck.  I will never buy anything from any place without making sure of the return policy.</Review>

We purchased a nailhead section nearly 2 months ago. The day after it was delivered we noticed that the "new" sectional was overly broken in. The cushion was sitting lower than the displayed sectional in store. As soon as we noticed the defect, we notified our sales associate immediately. She was very helpful and understanding of our complaint. She immediately offered a replacement and suggested we go in store for our replacement, so we did. A month goes by and our promised replacement has not arrived. We then contacted our sales associate and sure enough it arrived a couple of days later. When the replacement piece arrived, we noticed right after it was set up that that piece was indeed another defective piece. There was a large gap between the two pieces, the cushions now have gap in between each of them and above all the couch was slanted. Again, we immediately contacted our sales associated and she recommended speaking to her customer service manager and so we did (via telephone). CSM suggested we go in to either reselect a new sectional or get a refund, so we went back to the store and reselected a different sectional. Everything went well until the invoicing part. While waiting at the counter for assistance, I could hear the rude csm Maria telling a customer over the phone on speaker phone that she do not have time to assist that customer. The customer over the phone asked for assistance from a sales assoc. yet again Maria said she has too much to do to go get sales assoc to help the customer on the phone. Long story short, Maria was very rude and going to charge us delivery fee again for the reselect she suggested. We disputed it saying that the product they delivered us was defected. She was firm about charging us the fee still and walked away from the conversation. We had to get help from another manager and our transaction was finally finalize. AFG have pleasant sales associates, but the rudest customer service mgr (Maria). For being a csm, I dont know where her customer service is nor do I understand how she got such title. Hope they do something about her soon.< /Review>

John was nice however, he didn’t check the warehouse for the bedroom set we wanted (which was available just not displayed) and after setting up the the delivery date I called back 15 mins, after we left to change to the following week but apparently he didn’t update the change because I got a text the next day to confirm delivery for the next day. Luckily I called and the woman said it was a good thing because I was set for delivery tomorrow (the wrong day).</Review>

No pressure to buy. Salesmen don’t hawk you, let you roam freely, and even check other stores if you please. We did just that, and found they had some of the best prices and promos around.</text>

<Review>Never buy anything from this store or company. They do not back any of their product even when they dont work from day one.  We bought two Flexsheet couches that they also sold us the battery packs since we do not have power near the couches. We were told the battery packs w pop old last approx 150 cycle. They only lasted approx 10. When I called to complain temheyvsaud theybhace a no return policy. How's that when they ate defective. Now 3 months in my couch power plugs have stopped working.  Ive trying to contact Flezsheet as they have a one year warranty and they wont call me back. Both these companies are dishonest and will steal you hrad earning money.

<text>Stay away from this place!!! They are LIARS!!! We bought a sectional sofa and when it was delivered 2 days later they ended up ruinin my tile in the entry way by cracking it! My husband opened the front door where they brought it in and my husband finished the yard work. The next thing you know they come out have him sign for the delivery of the furniture and then leave. My husband walks in through our garage and looks at the sofa and as he walks around he noticed the cracked tile. YEP they took off and then we contact Store. It took Maria (that is who he was told to contact) 2 weeks to get back to us, we took pictures and everything and then got the run around. My husband finally said he would come to the store since he never was able to get Maria since they always said she was busy. He finally got patched through to her just for her to say that the driver said that they didn’t crack the tile, LIARS!!! She then said we would now have to deal with corporate and we still haven’t heard anything, not surprising! Horrible, we were looking for a dining room set but now we will be going somewhere else!!!!!!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>This is my first purchase at American Furniture Galleries. The sofa and loveseat set was considered a good price and within my budget. I was told that if I were to wait to Black Friday there will be discounted, but I didn’t want to wait. Two reasons why I didn’t give 5 stars are because 1) I had to pick the furniture up at a warehouse and not at the galleries (check warehouse hours). 2) All sales are final policy  (no return policy) that I was told by a representative which I found it to be uneasy in making a definitive/take it home to see how it looks or fits in with other furniture decision including if there is a minor defect such as loose threads for example then I am allowed to exchange but at my inconvenience (paper work approval and drop off and pickup another one at a warehouse. Anyhow, I have not been back for a while now. May be I might stop by on a Black Friday.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1541708957920, 'text': 'From top to bottom our stores work hard to make sure our customers have a good shopping experience.

<review>This review is based on a service that was performed on my bedroom.
I called in the service on January 13th, 2018 and spoke to Maria who is in customer service.
She assigned me a technician to come out to my house and the guy that came out only looked at it and said sign here.
Maria called me a week later and said that she was going to place an order for parts and it would take 4-8 weeks.
Maria has updated us with text messages and estimated time of arrival for parts.
My parts arrived and were exchanged on the last week of April and my overall satisfaction with American Furniture Galleries is a pleasant experience.  They do stand up to their warranty and Maria in customer service is Great. Minh was my salesman and he was very professional and gave us Free delivery with our purchase. I will definitely be back to purchase the chair that goes with my living room set. If you want a great deal and excellent service i highly recommend this store.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1525542421088, 'text': 'Thank you for your positive feedback about your customer service experience with us.

< review>
We purchased a mattress from American furniture galleries.  After about three months the mattress started to fall apart.

I called and spoke to the store manager, who explained the warranty process.  KEEP TRACK OF YOUR RECIEPT.

She immediately set up an appointment to have a rep come out and check the mattress.  He determined the mattress was a bad mattress.  They issued a store credit, and we also upgraded the mattress, with no problems.  It was delivered the following day.  Great customer service.

<Review>I am changing my review ... although Daniel was really great. Make sure you have everything in writing with the manager there or something. I gave a good review, Daniel said they would refund the delivery fee if I had the review up for 3 days. So my husband went 5 days later  and showed the manger the review he said they didn’t charge us but clearly they did my husband showed him the receipt, so then he goes oh we only do refund half the fee... the manager is the short Asian man. The 1st time we went there Patrick helped us and said if we didn’t get our furniture delivered yet and the price dropped they would pay us back the difference in cash not store credit. So we went back and sure enough the price dropped the manger said they only do store credit but when Parick told us that the manger was right next to him... sooo overall they do have some good deals you just have to catch it. But make sure the sales person and the manager are both telling the same thing as far as the deals they’ll give you.< /Review><Rate>3</Rate>< Resp>

Made the mistake of buying more furniture from this place the first couch and love seat were $5k and with the warranty it was supposed to fix any issues. The leather began to tear they took the couch in and weeks later we received it back and all they did was melt something on the tear. Looked terrible.</text>

This is the second table that I bought from this furniture store and also I would like to say the delivery guy that delivered my table the first time asked me if I like to drink coronas and put his hand on my shoulder I called the store manager and they responded with why would he do that if hes married well How would i know was my response the Second table I bought from them the guy never asked me if I would like a warranty for the table and also my chair was broke on delivery not once but twice  and its been like 8 days no ones still called me or delivered my chair 1000.oo table besides the 2 chairs I bought that were not like the one on the floor so now I cannot return the Item... I called the manager and there's nothing I can do about either situation so now I know never to shop there again for a dinning table and it still haunts me the guy that put his hand on me without my permission asking me if I like to drink when I do not drink any alcohol and he should of not even touched me I'm a customer  and my house is not a bar and they charged me for delivery 139.oo each delivery for each table that has not even lasted me a year<//Text>

What else can I say except that these guys are brilliant! I got such elegant furniture for my living room that really pull the space together. I was really impressed with how helpful their sales reps were. Thank you guys for the gorgeous furniture and quality service! I was considering just getting something custom made when I walked into AFG. Their service was awesome right off the bat and they had a great track record. After my experience I really can recommend AFG to my all friends and family.</Text>

I have never taken time to write or complain about a business, but this is a buyer beware to potential customers. This was absolutely the worst service!  I purchased a sectional and the extended warranty from them. When the material started fading less than a year later, I reached out to them. They had some one come out and take pictures but never followed up with me. I corresponded with Maria several times and Shawn a couple of times, and they never returned my calls as they promised. Now their position is they don't have any record of someone coming out to inspect the sectional and they won't stand behind their product or extended warranty. If you choose to business with them, do so at your own risk. Marcus was great...</text>

<review>I found the recliners I was looking for. Sometimes you can't find what you like other times you can. You just have to kind of look around. They have a huge selection of items it just depends on what you want to get. All sorts of furniture dining tables, couches, chairs, recliners, whole sets, beds, Etc. Do be careful to ensure that you are price checking things as sometimes the prices here are more than other places. Overall an okay place to shop. The only thing is many times you have to actually drive to their warehouse to pick up what you want as they don't have it there.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1522112274002, 'text': "Hi Jen!

Went back to the store, and was told I shouldn't have been called, and it wasn't available yet.  I was given free delivery, but it still took 22 days or so total for my frame to arrive.  Completely unacceptable, given I was told it would take a week.

Also, South Sacramento store lists itself as "Elk Grove".  It definitely is not.  It is right next door to Costco in South Sac.  While they may not want to associate themselves with South Sac, saying they are an Elk Grove store is like Dixon saying they are a Davis store.<//text>< user_id>

THE WORST IN MATTRESS OF BAD QUALITY AND VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Maria the manager speaks as if she is the owner of the store.
Her word is the only thing that counts.
The mattress began to sink on one side, to the extreme that my daughter end up on the floor at midnight, sleeping on the side of the mattress is like sinking into a hole, is causing them back pain and  legs, is not safe to sleep on that mattress anymore
we had to put the mattress and the frame away to avoid serious injuries
and to prevent my 3-year-old grandchild from falling into the iron frame and getting hurt,  so, we put it aside until the day of the inspection. When the technician was coming we put the mattress down to make sure the technician saw the damage well. The manager Maria, avoided my ins because we put the mattress on top of box spring and not on the frame when the technician came.
They are very different when you go shopping, that when you already bought something.< /Review>

Poor. Though the sales person was nice, the manager Marie was incredibly Unapologetic and absolutely not helpful when they made me pay a deposit and told me I would have to wait 4 weeks for my couch to be delivered then proceeded to call me on the 4th week and tell me that I'm sorry we have to cancel your order, this was after spending weeks double-checking and calling to make sure that it would be available her basic attitude was sorry you're just out of luck I'm very disappointed with her attitude and how she just frankly didn't care at all that we had driven an hour and would have to drive an hour again to try and find something else</Review>

Delivery didn't happen on the day promised. After 90 minutes after the promised delivery window I called and the sales person I bought from told me the delivery driver told him that they had called me and I had said to bring the furniture tomorrow, or call for a reschedule. This was not the case.

Rescheduled for tomorrow, sales didn't offer to refund the delivery charge. I have an 11-2 window tomorrow. If they're past noon, I'm cancelling the whole order. Over $950 of furniture they'll have to restock, and I'm not paying for restocking.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I ordered living room sofa set and half was delivered only. First they told us that order was cancel and than the give me different date and than only half get delivery and than second delivery date on the day of delivery that they confirm I cancel my work to wait for them and the day of delivery they call after 10 at around 11:30 and tell us the delivery is cancel when the delivery was suppose to happen between 10-2 that day.

I ordered this set because old one was really bad and had family get together and this what they screw us like and on top of it they tell me because of weather and when delivery is coming from LA to Sacramento

Purchased a couch labor day weekend. Delivered on time, but there was a hole in one piece and a burn mark on another. Took almost a month to get the replacement pieces, which a replacement piece was still not right. I was asked to email phots and they would get back to me asap about replacing the pieces i emailed them after i hung up the phone. It is now january and i had to call them myself, they sent someone out to look at it last sunday. I was told i would receive a phone call the next day to set up a delivery date for the new piece. It is now a week later and i just had to call them myself. No body had an answer and they said they would call me back. I guess i will have to call them again next week myself, i have really lost my patience with this company. I will never buy anything from them again.<//review>

The manager Shawn said he would take care of it and have it fixed/ replaced after the second technician came out the store reported they would not cover it.

I waited 2 whole months for my order when I was told that it would be ready in 2 weeks. We had to follow up several times to finally get a date to the arrival of my purchase. This was a real frustrating experience for me and my family.< /Review>

If I could give a 0 I would. We bought a sectional 4 years ago and the back cushions have broken down. The springs are popping through the bottom under the cushions. I called they sent someone out.  The technician said that it needs to be replaced. The technician said they would be calling in a few days. 3 weeks later I had to call them back. I spoke with the manager of the day and she told me that they only cover a 1 year warranty and that if I purchased a extended warranty it only covers rips stains and broken frames. The manufacturer doesn't carry my sectional anymore so they wouldn't be able to help me.

I said that they would have to replace it with a comparable sectional and told me that I would have to go through them and told me that my issues are normal wear and tear. Since when is springs coming out of our couch normal wear and tear? We don't have gymnast or children bouncing around on our furniture. What ever you do don't buy the extended warranty unless you thrash your furniture or break it in half.

I'm calling the warranty people and if they don't do anything I'm calling consumer affaris.<//Text>
