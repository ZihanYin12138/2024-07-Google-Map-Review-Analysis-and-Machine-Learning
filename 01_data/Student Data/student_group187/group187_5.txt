I needed a new policy for my vehicles and I called them up for a quote. I got quoted a very good deal for my two cars. The process was very quick and easy, I brought in my paper work and within minutes I got my insurance. My mother in law referred me to this company and I was told she will be getting a credit. I had a wonderful experience thanks to Ines. She was very informative and helpful. The whole process was easy and quick.< /text>

Stephanie L. Legorreta did a great job at finding the best quotes that fit in with my bad record. She's not only beautiful with a personality to match, she's also very helpful and gives insight on different options available.

This is the worst place to go get insurance they will tell you one price just for you to get their insurance and then when the bill actually comes it will be a higher price. They are all liar in there don't trust what Javier o Ines says. This is not a business you want to go to . I have had several problems with them and they never  fix anything. Worst customer service! I would never recommend anyone who needs insurance to come to this place all they care about is stealing your money!</Text>

I liked when Sam worked there i would giver her 5 stars but since I called and she's not linger there the guy who answered the phone wasn't helpful at all. I asked if anyone else there could do Purple and pink color he said no and rushed me off the phone. Usually those colors are super fun for cosmetologist to do not sure how they wouldn't have at least one other person willing to do it. Guess I won't ever go back there< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I, for the most part, have always had pleasant experiences here! I have been taking my client every week for over two years now, who has advanced alzheimer's, and they are always so patient and do a great job! For the past year or so my client has been going to Shelly and she is simply amazing! Her attention to detail, and her amazing heart is truly hard to find now a days! During this time I have been getting my hair cut by Blair, and I have never left disappointed! Not only is she super sweet, she makes me feel soo comfortable! I have long wavy hair, and I'm a chicken one it comes to anything to do with my hair and change. I'm so happy I found her because I don't feel so anxious about getting a trim/cut or even a color because she has never let me down! She did my color for my wedding and it turned out better than I could have ever asked for. Thank you Blair and Shelly!! 💛💙< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc83389762563b:0xde83cc6defd8e187</Gmap_id></record>

<review>A great place to chill at anytime of the week. Amazingly delicious pizza with large cut pieces of Bacon, Sausage and Pepperoni. Served with ice cold beer's. Great and friendly service. If you haven't visited Paulie's we totally recommend it to everyone. 👍😎🍕🍺</review>< Rating>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Came in the month of October and they had plenty of outdoor seating and a large tv outside as well. First time here and the pizza tasted and good and it looked. The three mushroom pizzas came out a little cold but brought them home and reheated them and they were great! Highly recommend for their regular pizzas. Definitely will come back and bring some friends. Also, just an FYI, there were a LOT of mosquitoes and I was bit at least 10 times in the short amount of time I was there. So take some OFF or mosquito repellant to stay comfortable.</review>< Pictures>

A friend and I came last week for lunch amd we shared a "small" sandwhich. Definitely glad we shared ! It was huge. We had the turkey. It does look like alot of bread but the middle had enough meat and toppings so it wasn't dry. They have tables set up outside. Take a seat and someone will be out to serve you. Friendly and fast service. Will be back to try other dishes :)< /review>

<Text>One of the best pizza experiences I've had in the IE. Very consistent and delicious product. They do not hold back on the toppings. Have very delicious ranch and a very cheesy and crunchy product. Stop by if you can, you wont regret it.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Did not sanitize area or tables in between customers. Tables were cleared but not wiped down. Though the menu is no contact menu they still passed same scan code sheet to access menu without wiping it down after each table left. Great pizza and service staff just disappointing covid protocols are not up to par.<//text>< pics>

My favorite pizza place. Period. Taken people from Texas to Spain here and the pizza stands out as some of the best. Great vibe, great hostesses, and service. Beer taps sport a good variety to appeal to many palettes. Always enjoy seeing the owner, Paulie, there too.</text>

The clientele is loud and rowdy but interesting. The place has developed a roster of regulars that add to the charm of this borderline dive bar. If you're here for a pie they won't disappoint. If you're here to wreck it, best place to start. Bartenders are cute too. Bang bang.<//text><time>1571460847356</time>< Rating>

We are so happy to have found a tremendous pizza place finally. Paulies has been an absolute staple for us, especially during the stay home orders. The quality and taste of the pizza is wonderful. The sandwiches are also delicious; the garlic bread and au jus make a perfect pair. You can’t go wrong here.</Review>

<Text>Pizza was amazing! But for those kinda prices it's hard to go there often. I'd say it's worth it, but $40 for two individual pizzas and 2 beers is pretty pricey. But great service as well.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This place has amazing calzones, pizzas and pastas. The beer is excellent. When they're busy they can sometimes overlook tables, which has happened to us before. Otherwise though, we come back every time we want good pizza.<//review>

<text>Heyyy, second experience here, the first was just a few awesome beers for the lemon festival. Tonight we ordered thru door dash. I have to tell you guys, incredible pizza the dough really nice soft but still crispy. The toppings so so flavorful because they use really good ingredientsm Pepperoni and mushroom soo dumb flavorful. The pineapple and ham such big slices and really fresh pineapple.  I really could not reccomend a better place to stop into considering how amazing the food was just delivery.<//text>< Pics>

Great place for a  few beers and a quality pizza. Quaint ambiance in downtown Upland, can become more adult friendly in the evening.<//review>

<text>At first it seemed it would be a "hole in the wall" kind of place but actually they've done quite a job of fixing it up to be rather cozy & comfortable. It's a long and narrow layout.
It's new and trendy and alot of the patrons from the nearby "drinking" establishments will go there after partying it up and have a bite to eat.  Keep this in mind when going there on a weekend  or Thurs-Fri evening as it does get rather busy and well, down right packed.
Can't say they have many regulars so, in my opinion,  a great place to meet and make new friends. Plenty of music and they like their sports with multiple TV's to see from anywhere in the serving areas.
A little pricey but all in all, well worth to enjoy a new pizza place with atmosphere.
Two small patios accent the place located both in front and in back.
Live it up at Paulies Pizza!<//text>< pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>If I could give less than one star, I would. I also work in downtown Upland and I had a horrible experience at Paulie’s. I’m disappointed to say the least. The food is amazing but the service is terrible. The night shift manager was not kind and very literally forced me and my husband of the restuant approximately an hour before the advertised closing time. I normally would refer customers to Paulie’s despite the terrible customer service because the food is good, but the service this time was so horrible that I can’t in good conscience refer people to this business anymore.< /Text>< pics>

Went to Paulie's during the Upland Irish Festival and had a great time.  The crew was fun and friendly and the pizza rocked.  Check this place out the next time you're in downtown Upland.</text>

<text>I love this place!!! The food is great, the atmosphere is fun and the vibe is awesome.

The pizza is too bomb. I've literally gone here 3 days in a row just to get it. Beer selection is moderate and bar tenders are chill. Good for families or just regular peoples.</review>

<review>The bread is great; not too sweet but just right. I love the mini burritos; beef and potatoes, chorriso with potatoes, cactus with eggs, pork with green hot sauce. You can call them and request your favorite burritos.< /review>< pictures>

This place has horrible overpriced food and the worst service, I bought three tamales, three sweet bread conchas, two baby burritos and one hot drink champurado on Saturday 11/16/19 which was almost $20.
The tamales were big but when I got home the tamales were really soft in the middle, I don't think they were raw but the better was soft in the middle.
When I went to the bakery the next day I told the cashier about my bad tamales experience, I would expect the employee to want to know more about my bad experience but instead she said nobody else complained as to say that my experience must not be true.

Overpriced food and the worst service!<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The chocolate cake is highly recommended! The prices I thought we fantastic. A few dollars for a piece of cake and a cookie. The lady working was super nice. They have a lot of different breads, cookies and cakes in their display cases.

¡La tarta de chocolate es muy recomendable! Los precios me parecieron fantásticos. Unos dólares por un trozo de tarta y una galleta. La señora que trabajaba era super agradable. Tienen muchos panes, galletas y pasteles diferentes en sus vitrinas.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The bread is very good, and they serve well BUT THE LADY WHO ATTENDS, IS MOOPPING AND SWEEPING AND GRIPPING THE GARBAGE CAN AND DOES NOT WASH HER HANDS TO DISPATCH THE BREAD. NEITHER WEAR GLOVES NOR BRING MOUTH COVERS, THEY ARE LACK OF HYGIENE, IT HURTS BECAUSE HE IS RICH, But one thinks about it to return due to the lack of cleanliness of the one he attends, EYE WITH THAT !!

(Original)
El pan está muy bueno, y atienden bien PERO LA SEÑORA QUE ATIENDE, ESTA TRAPEANDO Y BARRIENDO Y AGARRANDO EL BOTE DE BASURA Y NO SE LAVA LAS MANOS PARA DESPACHAR EL PAN. NI SE PONE GUANTES NI TRAE CUBREBOCAS, LES FALTA HIGIENE, LASTIMA PORQUE ESTÁ RICO, Pero lo piensa uno para volver por la falta de limpieza de la que atiende, OJO CON ESO!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Overall, had done a good job, but, seemed like they were learning from my car (probably), because it is the most recent version of BMW X1. I will not recommend for luxury cars. I took my MINI before and I was fully satisfied with their work then. The name has changed, I am not sure the ownership had changed or not.</review>< Rating>

<review>Unfortunately, accidents happen and Crash Champions - Torrance is listed as an authorized body shop through Geico!

I carefully selected this body shop, based on its reviews, as it's not the closest shop to my house. I've had my car for 1 week now, and I can honestly say it drives better than the day I drove it off the lot!

Here are a few reasons why you need to bring your car to Crash Champions - Torrance.

1. Trustworthiness - I left a pair of Beats headphones in my car - and totally forgot about it. They were still there when I got my car back.

2. Updates - I had an amazing advisor - Stephenie. She updated me multiple times a week. Whatever I needed, she made sure it was handled. Unfortunately, I had a part delayed by the manufacturer, by my advisor suggested I contact their corporate offices. Her suggestion escalated and resolved the delay. I never had to worry about my repair or work with my insurance company regarding the repair. Stephenie handled everything beautifully.

3. Craftsmanship - My car looks STUNNING! You would never it was involved in an accident. It's beautiful. I'm grateful I took the time to read the reviews and pick this body shop!

You will not be disappointed, bring your car here!< /review><UserId.>106004594629572426421< /UserId.><response>{'time': 1620074902199, 'text': 'Hi Danielle, we are so thankful you have shared your positive experience with us!

Excellent service. The body work looks like the original paint. They were also able to shine up the rim that was dirtied from the collision. I appreciated the text alerts and phone calls tracking the vehicle's repair progress. Would return if I need more repairs.< /Text>

Unfortunately from time to time you need to bring cars in for body shop repair if you live in Southern California, those number of times can add up.  We had been taking cars to a local AAA approved shop with okay results. Decided maybe it was time to try another recommended repair shop.  Very happy with results of repair to new car , less than 3000 miles.  Text updates helpful without having to call or wait for someone to get back us with information. Thank you Pete and Vernie for great service.<//Text>

I was treated so we'll; I was so impressed. I almost cried, they took so much care in repairing my car and going the extra mile to make sure I was happy. I'm never treated with such kindness and I typically walk away feeling as though I was taken advantage of because I'm a woman. I didn't feel that way at all with Pacific Elite. I had been dealing with so much, the last thing I needed was to fight over an issue that arose with my car and it was a non-issue for Pete. He's the best, and the treatment I received meant so much to me, more than anyone will likely come to understand. Thank you.</review>

< review>
Someone attempted to steal the wheels off our car but must have been spooked because they left with the lug nuts and the car leaning on two of the wheels. We called our insurance (Geico) and they said they partner with this place to 'express' client repairs, so we went with that. However, this place was very unprofessional and definitely try to rip you off. First they told us they needed authorization to look at our car on the lift. Ok great. They send over the authorization, but the only thing the authorization had on it was for us to pay 987 dollars (mind you, they know our deductible is 1000 dollars) for a bunch of stuff that didn't seem critical to the function of the car (which is all we were worried about) - the biggest charge was for some paint (literally a little chip on the wheel hub). I tried to call to get an explanation and told them we would not sign anything that said we owed money, and just wanted them to look at the car. Stephanie, the estimator, was very rude and acted like I was crazy! They finally looked at the car (without needing an authorization, which they originally claimed they needed) and said nothing was wrong with it. SO after several days going back and forth (not EXPRESS at all!), they finally did what we wanted - just a wheel alignment and replaced the lug nuts missing. they also charged us 35 dolllars for 'covid measures'... not sure what they did that they needed 35 dollars for covid. When my husband went to pick up the car, the guy at the counter claimed we owed 260 dollars (when we authorized 150 dollars). My husband asked him to talk to Stephanie but the guy refused and kept saying we owed 260. Finally Stephanie came and corrected him so we paid the agreed amount. So yeah I'd avoid this place. And I'm super disappointed with Geico partnering with them and was very uncomfortable that our estimate just happened to be 13 dollars less than our deductible... so I'll be reevaluating my insurance as well!</review>

< Review>
Used this place twice. Unsatisfied both times. I will not ever use this place again. Very unprofessional. Cheap work was done. Always complain things are not related to accident and ended up having to pay for over 500 dollars of damage myself after going back and forth with them and paying a 500 deductable. Very unpleasant experience. To each it's own.< /Review>

<Review>So far, the results of they’re repair to my intermediate suv is in tip top shape. And I thank them for that. The repairs took less then two weeks. The remote  call center is terrible but once you get transferred to the Torrance location, all is well.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I went in to get my car repaired from an accident, they said they won't be able to repair my car; and couldn't explain why. They claimed they called Statefarm to see what they could do. But that was a lie, since I called them in the parking lot before I left. Receptionist was nice on the phone but doesn't hear very well or doesn't repeat the info so she knows if what she heard was correct.</Review>

< review>
This place never got the opportunity to get my business because of their disorganization. I will be towing my vehicle to a different facility because of their lack of commitment to the customer and follow-through. I called twice and got different information each time. After 24 hours, my vehicle is still not with them and they blame it on my insurance. There needs to better follow-through with the customer and better follow-through with scheduled tows. They also cancelled my tow and sent a text message saying it was canceled for some odd reason. When I called they were completely disorganized. I would not recommend. Please do not waste your time.</review>

<review>These guys worked on my truck for over a month. They missed a some major damage to my transmission, and I ended up having to take the truck to the dealer to get it fixed right. I payed out of pocket for a rental car because pacific elite wouldn't reimburse me even though it was due to their incompetence. Just recently, I had to take my car back to the dealer because pacific elite screwed up my "suspension" that they "repaired". The dealer told me on both occasions that I could have been killed....think about your safety before you go to pacific elite<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

They only do insurance work and refuse work not insurance funded. They get very rude when confronted and they brag about their customer service.

<Text>I stopped by their shop & tried to get a simple estimate for them to repaint my hood. No body work, just a simple repaint. Unfortunately they made several excuses to not give me an estimate and couldn't give me the final price on the spot (even after they reviewed the car). They said they would call me back with the final amount, but never did. I guess they don't need any more business.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>Pacific Eliter collision center in torrance don't care about the customers at all. As one of the largest collision centers in los angeles, Pacific Eliter collision center in torrance shouldn't only care about money. I will not trust this store any more. I will not recommend my friends to repair their vehicles in Pacific Eliter collision centers in torrance.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The service here is great, and the drinks are prepared very fast. I recommend the mango smoothie, but I'm sure anything you order here will be great. Also, sometimes they give out samples.< /text>

This is my favorite boba place! I had have tried other places, but I don’t like any of those.
This is by far my favorite one!< /Review>

<Review>Unique drinks, properly cooked and prepared (is that redundant)? Boba! They care and it shows. They'll even poor you a sample of your drink they're crafting for you to taste if you'd like more sweet or less sweet. This place is a gem!

<Review>You can't go wrong ordering anything on their menu. From refreshing Thai tea with boba, to fresh and delicious sushi. This is definitely a plane to check out. :)<//Review>< name>

< review>
I've gone from the desert to Los Angeles, and I can honestly say that this Boba place is the best. The power of customizing your own boba flavors makes this place unique. Chains dont have the customer service like this place does, nor the taste! The variety is constantly expanding as well. Definitely my favorite boba place.</review>

Love their rose and jasmine boba. The regular milk tea not so much.
I wish they were located in Palm Desert as I'd go way more often.<//Review>

{'time': 1463632800122, 'text': "Hi Elizabeth. We apologize for the misunderstanding on the Mango milk tea. Our manager was on hand to readily remake the drink for you. Unfortunately,  the Orange green bubble tea is not served as a milk tea, and that is the one you kept. During the rush, our manager was unaware that you stayed to purchase an additional Strawberry milk tea. We thought that we had fufilled your order by remaking your Mango milk tea. Perhaps the misunderstanding was that you wanted us to take back the Orange tea and comp you for the Strawberry milk tea, which is not a problem at all if it had been brought to light at the store. We would like to fix that. We have a drink credit waiting for you any time you choose to return. We hope this resolves any misunderstanding and we'd love to earn back your business."}<//Response>
<Review>Had a misunderstanding over my order with the cashier.  She might of thought I was at fault,  I don't believe so.  Had to pay twice for the drink I wanted.  Sadly, they lost my family's business and any referrals I might have passed on over the price of a small beverage.  Also,  the location isn't great.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80daf829d3676153:0xb236ca811bce4ba4<//Gmap_id><userid>115336380398199266493<//userid><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

<Text>Wow, what an experience for my daughter today. Being only one person is allowed in the room, the staff was very accommodating in letting my 9 year old to be with Tyson. My daughter felt so grown up. Dr. Brittany Neal was excellent, and took her time when conversing about our pup. I highly recommend this place for your furry family members.

Took my two cats to confirm if they were pregnant or not and the doctor couldn't figure out if there were even though she's a doctor and said we needed to pay for a tester for 190 each! So I declined because that is too expensive and then I later on over heard the nurses talking about my cats saying that they were pregnant, meaning that the doctor did know they were pregnant and was just trying to make us pay for nothing.<//Text>

<Review>This place is really good. The staff is really nice. I came as a walk in they attended my dog very kindly. My dog had an infection caused by foxtail embedded into his skin the vet took him in to get it removed and cleaned his infection the same day. The initial price was around 500$ but they took off optional things my dog didn't really need which brought down the price to around 200$. I had a very good experience very nice people. My dog is good now his infection went away with the help of the medication they prescribed and he's back to his old energetic self. (Here's pictures of him in the vet and after he came back home from the vet)<//Review>< pictures>

Brought dog in for injured eye and was informed that she may need to have it removed. Dr Neal offered alternate treatment that worked and my dog has both eyes still, not showing any signs of discomfort. The treatment was effective and less expensive than surgery. Support staff were also helpful, explaining details and providing phone reminders. Overall great experience.  The people seem to genuinely care about the animals, not just $$$.Thank you !!< /Review>

Staff and doctor were very friendly,came here for a second opinion and I was not disappointed. Appointments are necessary but make the visits easy and quick. My dog got the attention she needed and was taken care of asap, which I appreciated. All my questions were answered and explained. It was also a lot more affordable than other clinics. It was nice and clean which is a big deal. They give you options and let you know what you're paying for. This will be my new favorite clinic to take my senior dog.< /review>

Took my dog for first time, felt like the doctor could of advise the  best treatment for my dog with her experience my dog had a hematoma due to  ear infection, since I took him on saturday they have you pick which option do you want for treatment So picked the one they able to do on Saturday needle aspiration ,next day came back, fluid of blood was almost the same as when I took him, I think she knew she mentioned  it could possibility return, it return next day  paid about $340 and then she recommended doing minor Surgery $546 2nd procedure  it too expensive ,she would just best treatment only would of paid once.  Took my dog somewhere else the  vetinarian of coarse the hematoma and blood would come back that wasn't the best treatment to doWon't go there again .</review>

Dr. Brittany Neal very much cares for these animals and their owners. Prices are still reasonable. And now they use technology (diagrams, data) to show more in depth the health of your animal after a blood test which is neat. The new design done to the hospital is refreshing.</review>

A very beautiful experience I had, recently took in my dog in to be put down and they did not rush they did not push they did everything to help, usually animal clinic smell and look bad but not this place it smelled very nice and was very clean and nice. The staff was very nice and I don't think the price is to much actually they where cheaper then the other places I looked around, I'd recommend this place.< /Text>

Alameda Animal Hospital is a great local vet for small animals. The front waiting room is nice and clean. The front office staff are nice and friendly. In addition, the young vet doctor is very friendly and knowledge. She gives you great information about the animals healthcare. Furthermore, once you make appointment you with receive a text message reminder a day before your appointment, or will call you personally if need to reschedule appointment.< /text>

What a wonderful experience my Pomeranian and I had.  I didn’t have an appointment.  Not only did they make the time to examine my dog, they didn’t rush through the exam.  I’m so happy with the new staff.  I’ve been coming here for a little over 9 years.  Front desk staff is welcoming, friendly, and engaging.  This is important as it sets the tone for the visit.  The vet spent time asking very good questions about my dog during the examination.  She was very thorough, made a couple of suggestions but NEVER applied any pressure to take those recommendations.  In all the dozens of years I’ve taken my dogs to vets, this experience reigns supreme and I’m talking 40+ years of vet visits.  Thank you for patiently answering all my questions and for the stellar service you and your staff provided.  If you’re looking for a great vet, please give this place a try.  They know their stuff.  This was not the typical trip to the vet I’ve had many, many times before with my pets over the years.  This was an experience—I left with more education about nutrition, prevention, treatment and overall well being of my precious dog.  It’s nice to have people talk to you instead of shoving a metric butt ton of brochures in your face.  I don’t live nearby but it’s well worth the trip to receive excellent service.  Thank you.</review>

Dr. Gibson was our vet for many years. He sold the practice and we were disappointed to lose him. We didn't know where to go our who we can trust with our dog's health. But our dog got so sick that we HAD to take her in. I called the vet and came in on a Wednesday and to my heart and pleasant surprise, Dr. Gibson opened the door and welcomed us!!! As it turns out, he works there one day a week (on Wednesdays). We were so happy to have our doctor back! My dog needed an operation to correct a  bladder problem and she is on the mend. I'm so happy Dr. Gibson is there. As for the management staff, I must say that Jason, who manages the front desk, is very good and nice. The young lady who took my cc info, misspelled my name on the bill, even though it's on the cc. But Jason made the necessary corrections and all is well again.<//text>

I've been taking my dog(s) here since their puphood and I can say I am satisfied with their service, friendliness and over all willing to help. My dog absolutely loves the people who saved him. Now one year ago  from now It's time to move on hence I moved else where, called to see if they could email me my dog's vaccinations and rabies certification, which was immediately sent.

As long as you communicate with them well you shouldn't have a problem. It's a pet clinic, they fight to save other people's pets everyday - it's not an easy job!<//review>

<Text>Under new management. Their service has declined tremendously. I’ve been coming here for over 10 years. I’ve recommended several friends and family, some whom tried since the new management and decided to go elsewhere. It’s convenient for me so I’m trying to give the new management time to improve. The new admin and receptionist are not pet or customer friendly. I’m here now and called 3 times to finally get a response and appt. I will give it a few more visits and hope for improvement. Otherwise will have to look for a new vet.</Text>< GmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>AWFUL!! I have been a 15 year plus customer and used to like the service and vet. Used to recommend friends and family. Felt it was more about the pet and the former staff cared. The new management took over the service dropped tremendously. Even pre-covid they were hard to work with appointments. The vet is constantly not in or at long lunches. The staff is unprofessional. They won’t work with you. Want to send every dog to urgent care because they have no walk ins or same day appointments. I’m already looking for a different vet. Raised there prices by a large margin. They try to convince you to run unnecessary tests to get more money out of you. If you love you pet take him somewhere else.<//Review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>The staff at Alameda Hospital is AMAZING!  My mother and grandmother has gone there for years. After relocating from Houston my dog became very sick. She suffers from reoccurring UTI's and had been having some digestive issues. There was a new Dr. there named Dr. Brittany. she took such good care of my fur baby and helped me come up with a long term health plan to keep my dog stabilized.  The staff was very friendly and has since assisted me with any questions I have regarding my dog.  There is no greater feeling than someone taking good care of your pet and knowing you can trust them with your pet!
GREAT JOB GUYS, thank you for everything!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I have been going to Dr. Gibson for at least 30 years. You will not find a better animal doctor, he cares so much for the pets. I feel so fortunate to have my pets see him. I have moved out of the area, and still go him.< /Review>< pictures>

I took my Pit bull in the day after Christmas a month ago today and I only took him in for a medical bath. An hpur later my dog was dead. They left him by himself and lied about being gone for a minute to translate for a customer that didnt psy yet. I paid for services. Devastated thst my fur baby is gone.  If I could put -negative next to tthe star.< /review>

<Text>Today 7-6-2015
I am so overwhelm with joy when I found this hospital,  the wait was 10 minutes top to be seen for the first time.  When I came in with my 8 week old cat my 16 yr old daughter crying and the cat having seizures uncontrollably it was heart wrenching to see the kitten suffer.  I had previously went to another animal care place that try to charge me $100 higher than Alameda hospital and a extra charge for medication which I could not afford.  Thank GOD for Alameda Animal hospital Dr. Thomas L. Gibson save my kitten life.  After the exam he knew exactly what was wrong.  The cost was very affordable, the lobby clean, the environment friendly and inviting.  I will be going back for more follow ups for my pet and would recommend you to do the same if you have pets.   My kitten name is Bunnie a.k.a Sea Buscuit she is recovering well, what a scare....<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2cb42eea12f0f:0xa307d8952c386b3</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very impressed by everything in this store. Some of their vegetables price are better than foodmaxx and the quality are really good. They also have cooked food, you can buy half roasted duck here instead the whole duck. They also have live fish or other sea food. If you looking a Asian market to go to, highly recommended this one. Fair price with good quality.</review>

This market is very small, but has a huge selection of Asian produce, meats and other grocery items. It's typically my go-to Asian market in sacramento. however, since the pandemic it is always very busy, so expect not to be able to find a shopping cart or basket and to wait in line for 20 or more minutes. People also are not very good at social distancing in the store, so be prepared for that. They're roast duck and barbecued pork are excellent my favorite hands down in town. Great prices and always fresh food.</text>

This used to be one of my favorite market to get fresh cooked food and my basic cooking ingredients. But recently, the store looks very cutters with stuff over stacked and things all over the places with very little room to walk and getting bumped by other customers. Totally a fire hazards👩🏻‍🚒.
The worst things about the store is the check out line😡😡🤬🤬. it has NO system! People just cuts in especially those shoppers from China and no manners in and no courtesy to line up like other shoppers. Even when the check out ladies saw them, she still let them cut in😡😡🤬🤬.<//review>

For a small Asian market that is located centrally near downtown, it carries all the things you would need. On the weekend, they have a lot more fish available. I even saw frogs alive. Though the market isn't big, they carry some specialty ingredients like young fresh ginger, live black bass, and even roasted pork.< /review>

No frills. Small Asian grocer with decent produce selection, dry goods, fresh and frozen seafood/meats. Not the selection you'd find at bigger Asian grocery stores, but definitely sufficient for day to day needs.</Text>

Very popular & convenient located Asian market. Very busy most days of the week- only form of payment accepted is cash, which isn't what people sometimes prefer. Selection of food items is good - finding a parking space can be a challenge.< /review>

We had stopped by to have some El Pollo Loco and this is located right next to it. It is an interesting place with a wide variety of foods catering to the Asian community that you do not normally see in any other place. They have a fairly good fish selection and it looks fresh. Some of the people working over there cannot speak English so it is a little tiresome if you want to ask a question. Overall the place was nice and clean weather White selection of Asian Foods.</Text>

Excellent prices on fresh meat and seafood. The best baked BBQ Pork Baos in Sacramento. Communication is pretty easy when it comes to food,  even with little English being spoken. The staff is old school and quiet so many people mistake this for being rude or conceited but it's really not. The folks there are respectful and kind. If you need help it will come! I've never felt unwelcome or uncomfortable here!

They carry live fish and crustaceans, the pork butt is gorgeous. I made char siu with it and it was better than all the others I've tasted in Sacramento. They have hot foods at nice prices. You can find cookware, frozen Asian convenience foods/snacks like Siu Mai, dumplings, and Baos.

There are sauces/spices/marinades of all kinds, most of which are not carried by major grocers or even advertised and unless you're familiar with Asian foods, you'd be suprised to see them.
They have a small but power packed produce section with real pricing. Fancy stores can sell exotic Asian pears for 4.99 a pound while AFC prices them around 1.99 a pound. The produce always looks fresh and shows that they move what they bring in.

Try the store out and you'll find something life changing!</Text>

This is where my family usually gets roast duck. It has an interesting selection of stuff, used to be the place to get certain things before 99 Ranch moved in near-ish-by. Just, sometimes the service is poor / awkward.</Text>

<Review>I come here because it’s close to where I live downtown. Their produce is reasonably priced and fresh. But everything else is really poor quality. Don’t expect good vinegar, soy sauce, Hsiaoshing wine, dried shrimp etc etc ie all the staples of Chinese cooking. But that’s a problem with most Asian markets. China produces a lot of really awful food products that are full of artificial colors and flavorings. And all the markets stock the same junk. Try finding good tea. Good luck. But back to our market in question. Don’t expect courtesy or a smile from the women who man the checkouts, they’re uniformly and perennially unpleasant year in year out. And the place could be a lot cleaner. When I get home I wash everything before I put them away.</Review><user_id>105443511303534337159</user_id></record></dataset><record>

ALWAYS CLOSES EARLIER THAN THEIR STATED HOURS, LIKE THEY'RE UNGRATEFUL FOR BUSINESS AND DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS. Also, I wouldn't trust the meat/fish and the produce looks gross. Have some grocery items cheaper than other Asian stores on Broadway, but literally not worth the hassle and grunge. Sacramento retail sucks.<//Review>

< Review>
**BE AWARE WHEN YOU ORDER COOKED FOOD**

They don't wear gloves when cutting/handling the cooked food such as the roast duck, chicken, pork, etc. When I asked for them to please wear gloves before cutting my duck, the young clerk became very defensive, claiming since her hands were clean the gloves would be unnecessary. However, I saw her using the same rag that she uses to wipe her hands on the chopping board! I then simply asked her not to cut the whole duck and just give it to me whole (since I didn't want someone else's hands on my food before I eat it), and she instantly insulted me, saying "you must not cook at home, huh?" How rude! Why not just put on gloves? Or if you don't have gloves, just tell me, and then not cut my whole duck? This also happened previously when I ordered the steamed chicken, so this definitely isn't a one off thing. That time was worse, though, since they also cut it up right next to the raw chicken and pork. As other people have noted, there are numerous basic health violations. Due to lack of hygiene, definitely don't go here for cooked food. Just go to Ranch 99, it's the same price and at least they wear gloves.< /Review>

The customer service is not the best, but as far as getting your Asian foods it's good enough.<//text>

It is a busy place.  Crowded.  But with a good selection of Asian products.  We especially like their produce and seafood departments.</text>

(Translated by Google) Green vegetables are fresh and discounted, meats are often on special prices, and the service staff are friendly, but the place is small and there are not many types of snacks.

Excellent experience with this company. I hired Air 1 Moving to move my business and although it wasn't an easy job they made it pretty simple thanks to well organized team. It went very smooth with no damage and final price is more than a fair. Highly recommend!<//review>

< Review>
I would not give this company a star if they needed it to survive, but I must in order to post this. Absolutely terrible service from beginning to end. It took almost 14 days to get our possessions even though we were promised prompt delivery. Broke or just lost at least three different major pieces of furniture and left all their trash in my garage as a thank you for the 5200$ we paid them for the service. Grossly incompetent, and I recommend you go with their competition.< /Review>

The staff at this company are amazing people. They did such a quick turnaround amazing job, that I would use these guys for every move I have in the future. Nir and his team are so great at what they do, Raphael Shea and Edgar were the crew that came out. These guys were so professional I will refer them to anybody I know that needs to move any size job. From my family to you thank you so much!< /Review>

<Review>So far, not so good. 30 days AFTER my belongings were supposed to arrive in Atlanta, Air 1 sent me an email saying my belongings were still in California.

When I called, I explained how EVERYTHING I OWN is in those boxes... My work equipment,, my clothes, my books... Nadia told me she didn't like that I was speaking to her in a patronizing way...What??? By the end of the conversation, she couldn't give me a definitive date for the shipment but agreed to call me the following Wednesday... I ended up calling her back on Thursday. She gave me more vague, empty estimates... it will probably ship by Friday... she might be able to talk to a supervisor about  the rate.

This is the most  shoddy, unprofessional and downright inefficient operation I've  experienced in a long time. I'm  supremely  disappointed and would never recommend Air 1 Movers.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c295cc16529821:0x2e69e17f5f4126b8</Gmap_id></record>

I needed an urgent move and after I called several companies Air 1 was only available. I also checked their recommendations and they are very reputable company. So I hired them. It was a great decision because they did excellent job and price was more than a fair. Thank you Air 1 Moving!< /text>

I had a great experience with Air 1 Moving & Storage. They were fast efficient and very careful with my stuff. I have worked with some other companies and they always break stuff or are just shady. These guys and their team were extremely professional and courteous. I will definitely use these guys the next time, they are well worth it!</text>

<review>I was told approx 9 days to 2 weeks. Took almost 6 weeks. Broken pieces and crushed boxes! Price over doubled and was not given accurate information on how prices, packing and timeline would be. I was told how final payment needed to be a money order then on my 24 hour notice was informed it actually needed to be a postal money order. Not impressed and would not recommend them.<//review>< Pics>

When I called in May was great! She explained everything properly. The issue was once the movers arrived to my house. The person in charge changed the price on me to start of. Complained that boxes were too heavy. Refused to move some boxes instead of repacking them himself so that they were to his standards. The entire time he kept complaining like a child that it was too much stuff to move. When it comes to paperwork be aware that they pressure you to sign things without giving you a chance to read. The movers were too lazy to remove my fridge doors so they ended making multiple dents and a giant deep scratch on my fridge door. When I called them out on it they didn’t even apologize. At the end he also try to trick me into signing that nothing was damaged. I wouldn’t sign and he became upset about it. He then tried to make me sign a blank document. I refused and asked him why that blanked document needed to be signed. He said that it was proof he gave me a pamphlet which I knew was a complete lie. He was trying to get me to sign that they were not responsible for the damages<//text>

I was referred to Air 1 Moving & Storage through a neighbor who used them, and I'm glad I chose to go forward. They said exactly what they were going to do and did that exactly. The price was more than a fair for such a great service. I recommend this company to anyone else who plans to move!!<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I selected Air1 moving and storage for my long distance move due to the positive reviews I saw online. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same. You personally were great and helpful, but the actual move itself was frustrating, stressful, and poorly planned. I have moved my stuff long distance 12 times in the past 15 years, and out of all these moves, this was the worst experience.

First, the packing and loading was an okay service but the actual cost of the move was 5 times larger than originally quoted. I would be okay with an extra $1,000-$2,000, but $8,000 higher?? I've never had that happen once in the past 12 long distance moves I made. Insane. Also, when I eventually opened up the boxes, I noticed that my possessions were thrown in with no regard. Boxes were mislabeled (or not labeled at all), stuff tossed in a chaotic fashion, and thrown all over.

Second, the unloading was an absolute mess. I was told several times by you and your company that I would be called 24 hours in advance of the truck showing up. That never happened. Instead, the driver of the truck called me 30-minutes before arriving at my house. This was incredibly stressful as I had to rearrange my entire day with a newborn baby, dog, and seniors living at my house to coordinate this. Then, the driver shows up with only one other person (I had 1,200 cf of stuff to unload), both of them wearing flip flops. It was apparent they weren't ready or prepared to unload. The driver then tells me that he is just a shipper (for Amazon Prime), not a mover, so wasn't prepared for this. He claimed he was not notified that he would be doing this, nor was he paid by his employer/manager (whoever that is) to do this. He wasn't sure if he could even do it. This was very confusing because the name of the company is literally "Air1 MOVING & Storage" and it states “unloading” specifically in the contract. Also, if he's not there to unload and move the stuff, what is he there for?? It took the two of them a long time (5+ hours) to do it, and they did it with their masks draped down below their faces (again, I live with senior citizens and a baby). Lastly, many of the boxes are damaged. There are tears, holes, crunches all over. I can hear glass moving inside some of the boxes. It is clear they were not moved with any sort of care.<//text>< Pics>

<text>AVOID. They have 21 business days from the date you specify as your first available day to receive your items. The 21st business day has passed already for my items, and I don't even have a projected date of delivery. My items are still in their warehouse. Covid is cited as the excuse. Better to pack/ship yourself than use this company. Movers who came to take items were also very rude. If I ever see my things again, wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of damages to claim. The only positive is they answer the phone if you call and those I've talked to are nice. But this is of no use if the company itself is not able to function efficiently. Their compensation for late days is only $25 a day. Just don't do it.

**Updated - for the past 2 days, I have been unable to reach the long distance department representative office and they are not returning my calls. There is still no projected date with respect to when the items will even leave from the warehouse.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

First let me state that I was in a dilemma and time crunch as I got screwed over by an unscrupulous other mover.  I got online as I needed to move cross country in 48 hrs...I contacted a company in NJ that connected me with a local company in San Jose CA.
At the time of the contract they were right in it and sent 3 guys to move as well as help me pack.  They were on time,  and professional.  That packed my fragile items and got my apt in their truck in just over an hour.
Now the reason for the 3 stars,  this happened in Dec 23rd... the contract read and I was verbally told that my items would be delivered,  best case 7 days,  worst case 21 days.   At NO TIME was it mentioned to me that this didn't include holidays,  that it didn't include weekends and therefore my stuff sat in CA for THREE weeks until their count of 21 days,  a month to me,  they sent out a truck cross country.  THEN they send me a txt and called to say I needed a postal check.. what? So I called customer service and she said a bank verified check was good.  They arrived and I was told they won't unload without cash as this check was not acceptable!!  Thank goodness I had someone at my home as I now had to go back to my bank and cancel the check and get cash!!
I have never moved like this cross country before as my previous time was minimal.
My family in a 5000 sqft+ home that we plan on moving in a couple of years south,  we will never use them or recommended them to anyone of my friends back in the bay area.
I was excited by the professionalism of the packers but the rest of the company and their associates totally ghosted me when I tried to call and txt.
Shame on them,  they not only lost me and my family but I will spread the word to my friends in the bay area..fyi, I was there for 25 years,  that's a lot of people!!< /Text>

<Text>I would give this company NO STARS IF I COULD -

We took a risk with this company and it was an added stress on top of an already stressful situation. During Covid my Husband lost his job and he found one in Illinois...we had 3 weeks to move from Los Angeles to Oak park, IL. He contacted Air 1 moving and initially, Morty (who was very nice over the phone) took all our info, number of boxes we'd have, furniture pieces, square footage of our storage, he talked with him for 45 minutes giving all the details of our apartment location and where our stuff was moving to...we felt confident everything would be ok. Wrong. When Movers arrived, they had no idea what we had. They thought we were only moving furniture and no boxes, no info on the storage unit, my husband called a friend to carry the furniture down the stairs because that was an additional $500 so we did it ourselves. We gave the guys half in cash as requested and went on our way. A day before we get to our new apartment in Oak Park we receive calls from the driver of the truck alerting us to a new $500 charge because he had to get a smaller truck and another $500 he would add to our balance if movers walk more than 75 feet. We were speaking with Kasey at this time who kept repeating himself about what an inconvenience this was FOR HIM. We needed to have him at the apartment at 11 am due to apartment rules our freight elevator cannot be used earlier than 11 am. He was really upset by this and wanted us to guarantee him a window of 8 am - 12 noon...AS WE WERE ON THE ROAD. When I told him we are driving and couldn't speak to apartment management right then and there his response to me was to "calm down, cause I am driving too." He bulldozed over us, HE KEPT TALKING AND TALKING AND DID NOT LET US SPEAK OR ASK QUESTIONS, HE CUT US OFF EVERY CHANCE HE COULD GET, as we were obviously stressed out and unsure of what we could do I settled into we just have to get this over with. This company put us in a really bad and uncomfortable situation. We moved all the stuff in our apartment ourselves with no help from the movers other than loading our furniture and boxes off the truck to avoid that additional $500. In addition to that, there was a piece missing, when I questioned the lead mover, Kasey, he stated the missing item was "one of the plastic boxes." he rushed everything and just wanted to get things out as fast as he could. He left and we noticed our mirror was listed as BROKEN... We called Kasey back and he informed us AFTER he ran off, that the mirror was in fact broken and we'd have to file a claim. We just called Air 1 and the employee who answer the phone couldn't have been more disinterested in our request for instructions on how to file a claim, she was unhelpful and rude. I would never recommend this company. We were quoted $3500 by the end of this we paid $5500. We were so stressed out and we felt like we were taken advantage of on top of that my husband's grandmother's mirror is broken. He has moved 5 times with that piece of furniture and never had an issue. They broke it AND NEVER TOLD US ANYTHING UNTIL THEY WERE GONE SO THAT WE COULD PAY WHAT THEY WANTED US TO AND GET THE RUN AROUND FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY. They are awful. PLEASE USE SOMEONE ELSE.

Update: this business called my husband as soon as I put my review up and told him they would not help him with compensation for the mirror they broke and threw away and lied about unless I took my review down. Shocker. They bribed us with peanuts to keep quite and never review their business well...shows how moral this company is.</Text><time>1610468082461< /time>< Rating>

I must say I had a great experience with this company. EBA Roofing recently replaced my roof with new traditional tile roof. They did excellent job, finished on scheduled time and within agreed price. So everything went smoothly. Highly recommend EBA Roofing for roof replacement or roof repair, will called them for sure if needed.</Text>

<text>READ long distance reviews before hiring! We hired Air 1 Moving for a cross country move from California to Washington DC because of their competitive pricing and strong reviews. While researching moving companies, Air 1 reassured us that 7-10 days was the typical and likely time frame for a move of our nature. Of course, they leave out that this is business days after your desired delivery date, which shows up only in the contract. Now, we are 2.5 weeks after our pick-up and our stuff is still sitting at a warehouse in California and has not yet departed. We have been living in an empty home during COVID for almost 2 weeks. Though this time frame is still technically within contract, we feel like the company misled us in order to secure our business. They have continued to be vague and overly optimistic about delivery, as it appears that it will likely be nearly 4 weeks after pick-up for delivery. This is completely unacceptable and we would have paid more to avoid this sort of delivery time frame. We have been told only that it isn't their fault and we can file a claim after our delivery.</text>< Pics>

-Proceed with caution-

I’ve moved across the country twice, and the first time was not pleasant. In retrospect, that move ended up being 10Xs more successful than with Air1. On the first move, items were certainly broken in transit cross country, but for the most part, expectations were met and the price I expected to pay was what I paid. Communication from the company at various stages was consistent and helpful.
AIR1 Moving and Storage underbid the “binding estimate” they provided via phone. The process for this was not as detailed as the other (2) proposals. AIR1 asked me to screenshare items in my apartment and then shared what they thought it would cost, and proceeded to follow-up with that proposal via email. Nadia was quick to respond via phone and email, and helped in providing me with information in order to make a decision.

The decision to move forward with AIR 1 was made for (3) reasons: 1) Price, 2) Customer Reviews, 3) Communication and Helpfulness.

My moving date was July 2nd. The head mover walked through the 1bed/1bath apartment and confirmed what was going in the truck, and provided a rough estimate of some additional fees: $400 dollars for packing materials; he waived the $75 dollars for the apartment being on the 2nd floor instead of 1st (though we had an elevator). He proceeded to tell me that the “binding estimate” provided via phone and email which was around $2,800 was just an estimate and it could increase by $900 dollars.
3 hours laters the head mover walks me to the moving truck (which I had not seen empty) and shows me the total cubic feet that my belongings had taken up in their moving truck. I didn’t ask if they used the little hitch above the carriage, but I took them for their word.

While in my empty kitchen, with all my belongings in the truck, the price then reached $4,329 dollars (with several discounts included). Thanks, buddy.

2 additional kickers:
⅔ of the payment is required at this point; the remaining ⅓ would need to be in cash, cashiers check, no credit card
there could be a $300 dollar transfer fee from a big truck to a small truck at the end destination with the same $75/per floor cost. You certainly aren’t told this information until it is too late!

My things are in their truck, I have a flight leaving in 3 hours, and I have a little pit in my stomach as I sign and initial 7 different pages.

FAST FORWARD - It is July 23rd.

On July 6th (Monday) - an email is sent by their long distance team with some questions about
First initial delivery date
Final address & floor

Some additional bits of information:
AIR 1 Guarantees delivery within 21 BUSINESS** days
They would provide an update when a truck driver was assigned
When it left California
24-hours Outside of the delivery window

It’s COVID, things are a little wacky, patience is a virtue, etc. I get it.

Communication is key, and keeping any timelines and expectations that were set by a company is important, especially in times of uncertainty, and when emotions are involved.

There has been 1 actual update, after calling the long distance department twice, and waiting on hold for 15-minutes. Only to be told nothing of substance.

Communication that I’ve had to initiate includes:
2 emails, 1 unanswered
2 calls - one with Nadia who promised an update by the end of the week which wasn’t met
1 call with the manager of the Long Distance Department, Lee. On this call, I was told I needed to be patient, and to check my spam folder multiple times
Lee communicated via phone not email (and did not guaranteed) that a driver would be assigned either Tuesday, 7/21 or Wednesday, 7/22
It’s 7/23. No call, email, or driver has been in contact with me. I checked my spam folder.

At this point, my PROCEED WITH CAUTION might be updated to: “It’s a little like a trap”.

I just hope my things are intact, and will arrive at all.

Sincerely,
A Concerned Consumer

P.S. Will provide an update as the experience comes to an end.</text>

Cannot Recommend this Company.

I used this company in January 2019 to move across the country. While I will say that all of the belongings that I received back were packed expertly, the company lost a CONSIDERABLE amount of my belongings; items that held extreme sentimental and monetary value, wedding presents, etc. When I contacted them to try and resolve the issue they were very polite, however they sent me through an auditing agency who after two months told me that they could not compensate me because I had checked a box saying that my stuff had been delivered. I was never asking for compensation, I was asking for my items to be tracked down and recovered. I emailed them again, to again, ask that they assist in returning my items and I never even got a response back.
So in conclusion, and based on my experience you are taking a very big gamble by using this moving company and they do not operate under ethical work standards should any issue arise.<//review>

I was promised within 2 days of loading my entire house were to be delivered at the new destination.  I purchased flight tickets for me and my 5 children coordinating with the moving quote time.  As soon as we arrived, there was no truck, the company cut communication, not answering calls, and we ended up sleeping in a motel.  After 48 hours, I received a phone call from the company asking me to prepare cash only upon truck arrival (not on the contract).  Following with a threat that without the cash I will not be provided with a date/time of arrival of the moving truck.  I then contacted both my attorney and the police for legal advice.  Within this time frame I spent 3 extra days in a motel with 5 kids and lack of clothing.  After 4 days of the company being late I contacted the company to update them with my options (police and attorney) they decided to provide a date as the day after at 8 am.  After waiting from 8am-8pm the following day no one showed up. Now being 6 days late, the truck showed up to begin unloading broken expensive furniture, and the workers said they were found from home depot.  Meanwhile unloading the workers ruined my new homes carpet completely, and left major scratches on expensive hardwood floor. Not to mention they used no professional moving tools.  They left the most valuable furniture and appliances for last to use as a threat if they did not get paid in full they will not unload the rest of the truck and leave.  I had no choice to keep arguing with them to complete their service and then get paid.  In conclusion I highly do not recommend this company, beware of air 1 moving.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Fabulous company!!! I would give them 10 stars if I could. This is an example of a company that under promises and over delivers. Being the first time this old lady has ever hired a moving company, I found it to be a confusing and daunting task. Brokers? PODS/UPAK? Big movers? Lots of unsolicited calls and texts; and horror stories, lots of horror stories.
Then I found Air 1. Everyone, and I mean EVERY one I spoke to or interacted with was unfailing kind, courteous, and friendly. Once I contacted them, they kindly and patiently answered all my (paranoid?) questions, and more importantly, did not badger me with phone calls or texts. Every stage of the planning and move went smoothly. They only asked for 10% down, unlike other companies who want 30-40%. On pick up day they gave a window of 8:00-10:00am and showed up at 9:00. There, they efficiently and gently packed the truck. They then promised delivery within 10-15 business days for the 600+ mile move. Only four, yes 4, business days later they delivered! Again, the delivery was on time, actually early, and the delivery men were courteous, friendly, gentle with our belongings, and professional. Within 2 hours our items were unloaded and placed. It was phenomenal, like watching a ballet.
Anyway, what could have been an extremely stressful experience was stress free for this customer. I heartily recommend Air 1 Moving and Storage!< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

Hands down GREAT experience.
Guys came in for 2 days work. First day was packing second day was loading.
I couldn't be more pleased with their work. We had some delicate stuff. The foreman took over and he personally wrapped it.
They estimated the time and prices precisely.
My wife and I are very happy. Thank you Air 1 Moving. You guys rock!!!<//Review>

I never put up reviews but i did this time because they were truly excellent.  air 1 moving is amazing. They just moved my entire office in 2 hours and i am shocked. They are extremely professional and careful. The employees packed everything with bubble wrap and did an excellent job. We were debating between them and another company but are very grateful we chose Air 1 moving. We would 100% refer them to all of our friends and family. Thank you Air 1!< /Review>

Fast, friendly, careful, and punctual.  These guys are great.  They have moved me 4 times over the past 10 years.  There price will beat out any other professional moving company. Their honesty is reassuring. They guys did everything  - including dismantling and rebuilding custom-made furniture. They move at break-neck speed, yet they handle boxes and materials the care and caution.

Call Air 1 Moving, you will not be disappointed</Review>

UNRELIABLE !!!  This company charged an arm and leg just to not be true to their own terms. The company held our things almost a week later the date we were given. In the terms its stated that if they do not deliver my home things on the date they specify then a return payment shall be issued. They are refusing to pay my husband and I back for delivering almost a week late. Horrible company, please research other options. My boxes were not handled with care. When the delivery company dropped off my things the boxes were falling apart and looked as if they were dropped many times.< /text>

I have to command this crew who moved me to my house in woodland hills . I couldn't believe how
This 2 guys lift my sofa bed up the stairs
It was a very hot day and this guys never stopped . The charges was fair and I liked when there was no surprise charges at the end.
This guys are here to get the job done.
Highly recommended .</review>

I moved from Boston to California using Air1 Moving and it was a great decision. From the pick up the service was nothing short of exceptional, the delivery took a bit longer than I would have liked but the way the company handled my move totally made up for it. The costumer service was superb and I felt satisfied and listened to every step of the way. I would definitely recommend air1 moving to everyone!</Review>

My best friend was moving into her new apartment that is closely located to the busy LA Live scene. I took some time off from work to help her pack & wrap some of her furniture, but we both quickly noticed that even this processes was taking too long. Hesitant on hiring a moving crew because of the little furniture & the cost, we decided to give Air 1 a try. Best decision we made ever made!! The company gave my friend a great deal & had all of her belongings in her new apartment, in as little as 5 hrs! I highly recommend this moving crew service (they saved us time & gas money!!) Ask for Jamie, he made the process of moving so easy & stress free!<//text>

<Text>I just used Air 1 Moving & Storage this past weekend and they we're awesome! They arrived on time and were very professional and personable. The pricing was fair, comparatively, and they know how to hustle! They're very hard working and everything gets done so quickly. They know what they're doing, they take control and don't waste any time. Seeing them working so proficiently, it took so much stress off of me. I've heard terrible stories from my friends and families who've used other moving companies, so I was really unsure about taking this route. I'm so happy to have found this company and will use them in the future and would recommend them to others.<//Text><response>None</response>< Pictures>

<review>I just want to thank to this company for been such an honest with me. I called to get an estimate, the  lady over the phone tolled me my job is too small(few boxes and a sofa) and she would have to charge me more because of it. She also guided me how she can make it really cheaper, and this by taking my stuff earlier with other move they have. I think this is all about customer service and been honest with them.

They did an amazing job, hands down
This guys are hard working guys who made me feel very comfortable on a very stressful moving day, when I had my two kids with me. I am planning to move again very soon and I know who to call. Highly recommended.< /text></record>

I got quotes from a bunch of different companies before settling with this company.  While I hadn't known anyone who had used them before, I decided to role the dice book them for my move.   Quality service with a happy office staff! What more can you ask for when scheduling a move? Thanks Air1 Moving and Storage. Your help and cheery attitude during my relocation,  made moving a walk in the park! BRAVO!

*** I will defiantly use them again, and I'll recommend them to everyone I know.< /Text>

I really don't enjoy moving but Air 1 made it as painless as possible. I've never worked with a company that provides a free estimate and it was a great experience. I met with Matt who came out the week prior to my move. He was super nice and gave me the estimate later that day.
were super fast while also very responsive and professional.
I really can't say enough about how impressed I am with his company's service. They came under the estimated amount and took 5% off for paying cash! Sooo happy!</text>

I recently received a job offer I couldn't turn down, the only problem was it was in Sylmar. I lived by K-Town and I knew the commute would kill me and my gas so I decided to move out there. I was referred to this company by a friend and I'm not looking back! The workers were punctual, arriving at the scheduled time and very professional and friendly. My decision to move was sudden and they responded in a timely manner, ensuring my move would be as least of a hassle as possible. I'll be recommending this company to my friends as well, and will be reaching out to them should I find an even better job opportunity elsewhere or back in LA. They could use a slight improvement on their workers attire though, it appeared a bit dated, but overall satisfied with their service.< /Review>

<Text>This was probably the worst of my 4 cross country moves. They were just horrible. I told them explicitly of the antiques that I had and they proceeded to only throw a blanket over them and tape it. I have over $100,000 worth of broken antiques and they have offered me $167 in compensation. Do not use this company ever!! They DO NOT CARE at all about you or your possessions or how they are care for. My unpackers said this was the worst packing and most broken things they had ever seen. So very disappointed.<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I recently used this guys to move from my apartment in North Hollywood to Sherman oaks
My old place was a mess due to a water damage I had from the Apartment above me.
Some of my things had white drywall that fell from the sealing due to the wetness.
The crew that came was fast and efficient and organize everything in a spectacular way.
They packed everything and moved it in about 4 hours pretty amazing because I was not organized whats or ever and I called them in last minute. I will for sure use them again.
Thanks you air 1 Moving<//Review>

< Review>
I used Air 1 for a move 10 days back. I consider two factors when picking moving companies
1. Online ratings
2. BBB rating
I will start with the good.
1. They were very responsive and sent me a quote almost immediately after I asked for one
2. They worked with me on dates that would work for me and were upfront about their rates
3. The movers showed up punctually on the date of the move and were generally genial and very pleasant
4. My move is a long carry i.e. there is a bit of a walk between the truck and the apartment and the movers did not complain about it
5. They picked up pieces of my furniture that I was going to discard to donate to a church (which was awesome)

Some of the things that I was not thrilled about include
1. About 20 minutes at the start of the move were reserved for the movers walking from room to room and taking stock of all the items that were to be moved. I was charged for this as part of my move time. I dont know if this is standard practice but I felt like I should only be paying for the time they actually spent moving my furniture
2. I have moved 5 times in the last 5 years so I am able to objectively compare movers. There was a lack of urgency with the movers, i.e. I did not think they worked optimally amongst themselves to do the move in the shortest possible time
3. I lost a couple of items during the move including my hoodie and my Durabuilt toolkit.
4. They forgot screws for the bed frame in my old apartment and so I had to partially assemble the bed myself
5. They ended up not assembling my study table before they left
6. At the end of the move, Air 1 wanted to charge me for 30 minutes time taken to set up their truck. This seemed unfair to me and I was able to talk them out of it but it took time and negotiating.
7. No follow up from customer service about my move experience

Overall I was satisfied with the service I received, I have had worse move experiences.<//Review>

Worst company I have ever dealt with. I honestly can't comprehend the levels of incompetence I have dealt with. Repeatedly lied to me over weeks about when I would have my goods delivered<//text>

Everytime I convince myself it will be easy, and everytime, I regret taking it on (and being nomadic) by the time I'm halfway through.  A friend recommended Air 1 Moving and based on the projected cost, thought it was worth trying something different.

The three man crew showed up on time and ready to go.  They did a quick walk-through of the property, asked about anything that might be extra "handle with care" applicable and went to work.  They actually jogged back and forth from house to truck, and when you're paying by the hour, that is certainly appreciated.  Everything (two bedroom condo) was loaded up in 90 minutes, and they took the same time to unload.  $425 later and no broken items, no sore back and no regrets later, it was money well spent.

Thanks to Carlos and team for your hard work.  I've already recommended Air 1 Moving to several others looking to move in the next month!< /Text>< time>

<review>Worst experience ever.  Worst customer service ever.  we were intentionally hung up on multiple times when we were trying to get a status update on our move, they changed pick up dates without even notifying us and did not apologize for this, just said "well do you want us to move your stuff or not".  This is after we had already paid them the deposit.  They quoted us 14-18 days to receive our stuff and 28 days later we still do not have our furniture.  Their quote was $500 less than what they actually charged us.  Everything they have told us has been a lie.  Vicki there has the worst customer service ever.  If you get this company's quote to move, run very far away from it.  The quote doesn't mean anything, they will charge you more later, they do not honor their timelines and do not care to do anything about it.  Over promise and under deliver is the company moto here.< /review><Date>1413327359711< /Date><rate>1</rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Shady, incompetent, fraudulent.  Do not use this company.  Firm phone quote was $1,800.  Did not personally see quantity of boxes to be moved.  After truck was loaded, told us it would be $3,200.  They helped pack some items.  Truck was barely street-worthy, covered in graffiti.  Stored for a few days, then drove our materials in another truck to the Austin area.  Got lost, were late, backed truck over curb, yelled at us, they threatened to call police.  Then they dropped an antique item inside the truck, which shattered in front of us.  Several other items were broken or damaged.  Boxes labelled "top only" were crushed beneath a pile of tubs.  Our stuff was mixed in with other people's stuff--something else they said would never happen. We photographed everything as best we could, but inventory/box numbers did not match what was on their inventory sheet.  We were told we would be reimbursed full value for broken items PLUS 10% off the overcharged amount, so $320 + amount of damage.  We had to file a claim with a third-party company in Florida, which took five months to rule on the claim and awarded us all of $140, even though we went all the photos and documentation they required, at our expense.  Air 1 claimed WE packed everything, which was not true.  They low-balled the value of several items.  A 400-CD changer, clearly labelled as such, had to be kept right-side up, for instance, and was labelled accordingly.  They flipped it upside-down, dumping all 400 CDs inside the unit.  It's never worked since then.  They denied any reimbursement, saying it was "electronic malfunction" that could not be proved.  Short of taking Air 1 to court, which we were tempted to do, we had no choice to but take their paltry offer.  The company low-balled in order to get our business, then shafted us every step of the way, rushing us through signing a contract AFTER the truck was loaded.  They were unprofessional, shady, incompetent, and should not get anyone's business, whether it's moving across the country, like we did, or across the street.<//review>

Customer service was actually on point. Whoever is at the front desk was kind and patient with all of the questions I had such as what double drive was. Hopefully I don't have to move again soon but if I do, I know who to call.< /Text>

<text>RUN AWAY. DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE FAKE REVIEWS. This is one of the most dishonest and uncaring company i have ever dealt with. I'm shocked that such business practice exists and is legal.
My move was contracted to Air1 Moving  & Storage. The day of move, I have three movers from Air1 come to move and two of them does not speak english. BELIEVE ME THEY DON'T LOOK PROFESSIONALS LIKE IN THE VIDEO THEY HAVE HERE. My move was supposed to be estimated by weight, but on the day of  pickup they said it would have to be by volume. So, they randomly predicted the volume of my move and said i was more that 100 cubic ft over than what was estimated. The movers did not look and work like professional movers at all. So they charged me $550 extra for the move. They made me pay the remaining half of the total and said that i would have to pay $900 remaining when my stuff arrives. 5 days from when they picked up my stuff they still haven't moved it from my warehouse. I had to call Air1Moving to get the status.
Air1 had now contracted my move to Move Experts. 10 days afer the pickup, they call me and tells me my remaining total is $950 and is not $900. Either pay the $50 more or they would not deliver my stuff. I had to agree to their THUG request since i was already sleeping on floor. Now, the day of delivery this truck driver picked up two non english speaking Mexicans from home depot or somewhere to deliver my stuff. They did not understand a word i said. The truck was packed VERY POORLY(PICS INCLUDED) with other people stuff over my stuff. They broke my bicycle, vacuum, crib, bed, lamps. So, they basically charged me for full packing service and sent two UNKNOWN MEXICANS to deliver my stuff. The Mexicans were afraid that the truck driver (ninja moving) would not pay them and were making sure that he does not run away. While moving my crib, they dropped it and dented it badly as well. Fragile boxes were put UPSIDE DOWN in truck as well as in my room. My TV was put flat on the truck with some other peoples stuff on top. I had to instruct the Mexicans who did not speak english on how to assemble my furniture. THEY DID NOT HAVE NECESSARY TOOLS TO PUT MY FURNITURE TOGETHER. THEY WERE ASKING ME FOR IT. They almost broke my TV when trying to assemble. I let them go and assembled on my own. I HAD TO  STAY OUTSIDE WITH THE TRUCK DIRVER TO TELL WHAT STUFF WAS MINE AND WHAT WAS NOT. Oh man.. I'm boiling up even when i think about it now. They also did not assemble my crib back and LOST all the screws for it. So, my child is right now sleeping with me on my bed. The truck driver again charged me $75 extra saying that it was a long carry when he had not even brought professional movers. The whole time, AIR1 MOVING extorted me to either pay more money or i would not get my stuff.

Do not believe in the ratings they have or anything they say. RUN AWAY.</text>< rating>

<Review>For anyone reading reviews about this company, this is for you.  Do NOT even consider calling these people for a quote first of all.  They are shady and the most shifty, fraudulent people you will come across with that is doing business.  I used this company two months ago and the three movers that were sent to my home to move my items stole money from my handbag.  The movers are: Uvaldo Gamiz-Avalos, Alejandro Hernandez, and Richard Guertin.  Uvaldo had all the cash on him that he stole from my handbag, including the money he stole from my daughter's piggy bank.  $2900 in cash that was given to us for our new home and $302.00 from my daughter's piggy bank...down to the $2.00 bill that was included.  The owner Nir Ben-David is just as shifty as they come.  He didn't care one bit about what happened when I explained to him the following Monday, since the move was on a Saturday.  He referred me to their claims dept who are just as worse as he is.  Of course they didn't do anything about it.  This was the first time I used a moving company and definitely the last.  Also the truck they used shouldn't have even been on the street.  It was ready to break down.  They are all crooks and could care less about your furniture, your valuables and you!!  Do Not use this company EVER!!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c295cc16529821:0x2e69e17f5f4126b8<//Gmap_id></record>

Lindsay is an amazing and extremely helpful realtor.  She’s always there when we call no matter what time of the day.  My experience buying and selling my property was seamless and fun.  Thanks to Lindsay, I was able to sell my home for asking price and get into a great new home in Costa Mesa.  I would highly recommend her!<//text>

They are very professional and well organized, They have a game plan from start to finish and are always ahead of the game. They accommodate to your schedule and organize the showings in a structured way so no time is wasted that way you can view more listings in a day. Being a first time buyer you don't know what to expect,  but they make it easy walking you every step of the way and explaining what is next. If you're looking to buy your first home or even buying another property give them the opportunity to help you. You will not regret it. Thank You Yolanda & Luis you guys are the best.< /review>< Pictures>

Elizabeth Garcia was excellent in every way.  She was extremely patient in answering any questions, following up to any concerns and keeping us informed of the process along the way.  I never felt that she was just trying to make a sale.  I would never hesitate to contact her again for assistance or recommend her to friends.  In addition to her wonderful professionalism, she was an absolute sweetheart.  Thank you Elizabeth!</Review>

I’ve sent over several clients to work with Margarita, every single one has come back with basically the same message. She was hard-working, extremely knowledgeable, always professional, and they truly felt like she cared and was committed to seeing them get the best. That level of excellence and service goes a long ways in my book. I will continue to send all my clients to her, I couldn’t be more thrilled with the level of service she has been providing. Highly recommended.<//review>

She is a true professional and a wonderful person. I understand the process of selling a home can be stressful, but you cannot find a better Realtor. Sold our place within a month. She continued to work hard (along side her team) to insure we had everything completed for closing. In my past experience out of the five realtors I have used, Elizabeth is the best by far!<//Review>< pictures>

I got connected with Judy from REMAX New Dimension through Zillow when I started looking to purchase a condo. From the first point of contact, Judy was very responsive, professional, and patient.

Buying a home is a daunting process, and especially your first home which was my case. Judy was excellent at explaining the home buying process in the beginning and maintaining me informed and keeping me in track to get through every single step once we made offers and started escrow.

She took the time to understand what I was looking for, and then proceeded to find and show me listings that fit my needs. She was always available to answer my many questions, and even when she couldn't answer the phone I could expect a call back within minutes.

I highly recommend working with Judy if you're looking to purchase a home. She is very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and made the process much easier.< /Text>

Elizabeth was extremely helpful, open, transparent, and reliable through the whole process of the Short Sale, She really cared about us, understood our needs from the very first day. Even though it wasn't her Job. She helped us look for a rental. She helped until we were moved in and settled.  There's only one word that comes to mind. " Angel ".
She truly was and is an Angel sent from Heaven.
Elizabeth always has and will be considered part of the family.
REMAX Management and as a company, deserves praise for the wonderful agent they have working for them.
When I'm ready to purchase another home.. I already know who I will call.
Thank You Elizabeth.
Thank You REMAX.</Review>< username>

Margarita Corona is an excellent realtor, she helped me buy my first home, she was always so helpful with any questions I had making it easier to understand the whole process. Margarita would answer my calls/texts right away or would get back when she was busy ASAP, she was great at listening and showing me listings that were of my interest. She helped me find the perfect home and it was all a smooth process, I highly recomend her!<//text>

We are so beyond lucky to have had Luis and Yolanda assist us in buying our first home for our family.

With such an unpredictable market during our home buying process, I could not imagine having anyone else represent us.

The knowledge they both have of the market, their expertise on competitive pricing and writing competitive offers, they truly assisted us every step of the way. We looked at over 100 homes over a 6 month periods, often driving all over the county, they organized all of our showings to accommodate our hectic schedule. Each home they ensured that they fit our criteria and only wanted what was best for our family. They are so great at communication which was extremely important during this process. They also made sure to explain every detail to ensure we had a clear understanding to what was going to happen moving forward. We can’t recommend them enough.< /text>

Elizabeth García created a great marketing plan that was focused on our needs and expectations. The house was well staged and photographed beautifully. The listing was timely and we received multiple offers within days of the house going to market. All offers but two were well above the list price. The house sold for 9.5% over list. Very happy with result.</Review>

<text>Socorro has been awesome in finding homes matching our requirements and she is also quick in arranging showings upon request. She never pressures us to buy anything that we don’t like . Her patience and explaining things are her greatest strength as a realtor. My family and I were really happy working with her to find the best home for us.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>
<review>Jesus Morales helped me list and sell my home, he was very effective at communicating, he took care of everything and was a very smooth process. He would call me almost everyday to keep me updated of what was happening with the process. I would highly recommend him to any one who is thinking about  selling a house. He is genuine and would always ask if we had full understanding of what was going on. Thank you.< /review>< Name>

I had an amazing experience working with Elizabeth Garcia, she gave great advice and was able to get us our dream house at record speeds right on our budget.  She listens to your comments and suggestions and takes it all into account when looking for your perfect home. She is a great accent for Remax.  Highly recommend the company and Elizabeth as an agent :)<//Text>

<Text>Elizabeth was amazing!  She was able to save us a bunch of money by fighting for seller concessions, which is insane in this market.  She was on top of everything, helped us close in under 30 days, honestly the easiest transaction I’ve ever done.  She’s our agent for life!<//Text>< pictures>

I had the pleasure of working with Luis Arellano through my journey as a first time home buyer. He was very informative, professional, supportive, and quick to respond. This whole process was not just new but also scary for me, but Luis really put me at ease with his expertise. I am so grateful to have worked with him and will continue to recommend him to everyone!</review>

Elizabeth Garcia is extremely responsive and helpful.  She has great knowledge of the housing market in the Orange County area and has always been fast to obtain the answer to any additional information we had on the properties viewed.

<review>We have known Elizabeth Garcia since 2012. We have worked with her on 3 separate transactions with her since then. Her passion, knowledge, experience and most importantly her ethics, are bar-none, the best we have ever come across.

Elizabeth Garcia was incredible in both selling our home and purchasing our new one.  She worked tirelessly to show our home while taking us on tours of new homes.  Her knowledge of the business and applicable laws are unparalleled and saved us a ton of grief and money.  I recommend her without reservation for selling or purchasing your home.<//text>

After dealing with a hand full of realtors Priscilla was able to make things happen.  She did her due diligence by working behind the scene to make the purchase of our dream home possible.  In this market having Priscilla represent us was a huge advantage.  I would recommend her to all my friends and family.

She’s very patient and goes above and beyond for her clients. It has been a pleasure  working with her and having her as my agent. She helped me find the house of my dreams not just mine but the house my family loves.
I’m very grateful and very happy I found her.
She’s one of the best realtors out there that really cares for her clients and their families.

Elizabeth Garcia was referred to me, I can't be any happier with the end results. It was a long and trying experience and Elizabeth was there at every step communicating and working hard for me to find, bid, and close on a house of my dreams. First time buyer and she took the time to educate me on the process. She is #1 on my book.</Text>

Jessica is also very responsive, and is always available 7 days a week to help with anything. We submitted multiple offers  to different houses, and all of them were accepted. Because Jessica have a close relationship with lenders, she is able to work with lenders to offer very fast escrow and beat out competitors. I would highly recommend her as a an agent</Text>< pics>

Jason Luu was everything and more than we could’ve ever asked for in a realtor. He is dedicated to perfecting his craft and is constantly keeping up with the market. Last week we called in for a tour for a property and being first-time home buyers, we had so many questions. One by one Jason answered them all and made us feel at ease. He approached us with such generosity and definitely made us feel that our family needs were his main priorities. Before meeting Jason, we felt as though we were always in the dark, we didn’t know what steps to take or not to take. Jason was there to hold our hands and guide our family to where they needed to be. I highly recommend reaching out to Jason if possible. He will always be our realtor for life.</review>

I was looking for a particular property with certain charm and reasonable price. It was hard to find but Sharon with her experience, knowledge and contacts in the industry was able to find a perfect place. I am enjoying every minute of my new home.

Aurelio has been very patient and knowledgeable throughout the stressful processes of finding the right home. He has definitely put in a lot of work to make our dream of owning a home come true. Overall the company is reputable and holds it’s self to a higher standard. I recommend everyone who’s looking to purchase a first and even a second home to give them a chance to right fit you with your dream home.</Review>

<Review>My experience with Miguel as a realtor was very positive. Coming in as a first time buyer, I was very nervous. He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable which calmed my anxiety down on a few occasions. I didn’t feel like he was being pushy and trying to get us into the first house we saw. We explained what was needed and he even threw ideas to use the rooms to better maximize them. I recommend Miguel and his whole office to all my friends who are looking to buy or sell.<//Review>< Pics>

I have been working with Aurelio for the past couple of weeks and he has been great! He’s patient and understanding especially with a picky buyer like me, he answers all of my questions and has been very quick to respond. I appreciate his honesty and dedication to his clients as it is sometimes hard to find. Thank You once again Aurelio!<//Text>

Buying a home is one of life's major events and having a competent realtor is a must.  Judy Campuzano is more than just competent, she is excellent.  Not only does she know the process, she listened to our needs and found us multiple listings.  She showed us homes that perfectly suited our budget, a few fixer uppers, and a few at the very top of our price point.  This was important as it gave us a solid understanding of what we could and what we shouldn't try to buy.  Once we made an offer, she kept the process moving forward and was in constant contact with us every step of the way.  If/when I buy another home I would certainly want to work with her again.</review>

Nagla is by far the best!! What a great experience it was to have her represent us! Not only is she responsive, but she is detail-oriented, friendly, and very knowledgeable. We put our house on the market and we ended up with multiple offers shortly after. Look no further for a realtor because she is truly one of the best out there!!< /review>

Lamar and the ReMax New Dimension team have been outstanding in their guiding us through the buying and selling processes, patiently answering our questions and giving us advice specific to our situation and needs.  Lamar definitely gained our confidence and trust in his work on our behalf.  From a financial perspective, we spent less and made more than we expected to and ended up with what we think is the perfect property.< /text>

I live in NorCal (BayArea) and actually contacted Valeria and her husband, Jesus, because a family member in SoCal recommended them. They helped my husband and I get our dream home here in NorCal even though they reside in SoCal. They partnered with someone here and the  process was smooth. They are very detailed oriented and knowledgeable in the field. Whatever question I had, I got an immediate response back from Valeria. Valeria and her team make you feel like family, not just a business deal. I highly recommend Valeria and her team.< /review>

< Review>
Sharon is the best!  She is thorough,  professional and great to work with. She is very knowledgeable of the local market. She was very helpful by explaining everything in a way that was easy to understand from making the offer to working with the mortgage banker.
Highly recommended<//Review>

<Text>I am a realtor that specializes in Ventura County property.  I had a client that was looking in either the Anaheim or Fontana areas which is out of my area of expertise.  I searched fellow RE/MAX organizations looking for the right match for my clients when I came across Claudia Negrete of RE/MAX New Dimension.  I read her bio and then interviewed her over the phone.  She seemed like the perfect match.  Experienced, knowledgeable and motivated to customer service.  I made the introduction and stepped out of the way.

Claudia jumped on the situation immediately knowing that inventory is tight and wanted to expose our clients to available properties right away.  She met with them and got right to work eventually helping them to find the perfect home for them.

What I like about Claudia is her enthusiasm to her profession, her communication skills by keeping informed of their progress and her persistence in this very competitive market.  The inventory is extremely tight right now but she wouldn't give up until she was able to get a winning fair offer accepted on behalf of my referral.  Then she and her staff managed the file to a successful closing.

In my nearly 40 years of real estate business I would say that Claudia is one of the most trustworthy agents with whom I've worked in a referral situation.  If I have more referrals for the Orange or San Bernardino Counties I will go to Claudia first and highly recommend her to others.< /Text>< pics>

Aurelio was amazing to work with not only was he professional but he’s been available for any questions and concerns that I may have had, as a buyer the buying process may be such a difficult experience but I can gladly say that this was no where near the experience I had with him, he was available at all times and made this an enjoyable experience as buying a new home should be. Thank you for your service and all the attention to detail.<//Review>

<Review>Hi had the pleasure to
Meet Sharon Vasquez almost 2 years ago, in the end I did not purchase a house, because thanks to the covid i lost my job, but she always contacted me asking how I was, even if she knows that now I am renting a new place and I will not buy anything for maybe 5 years?
She is really nice and honest.

Together we when to see apartments and she was the one telling me.. no I don’t like this one for you. Let’s go see another one 😊

I will always ask for her help and I will tell all my friend to reach out to her if interested to buy a home</Review>< date>

My real estate agent, Jerry Gallegos, was the one who made it possible for me to own a home along with his team at REMAX.

I am very pleased and so happy that I met Aurelio Osorio. He has been so helpful and has made it possible for my family and I to find our new home. He was always informative, available, and knowledgeable and made the process seem so stress free. I will be recommending Aurelio to anyone I know who's looking for a new home.< /Text>

<text>Prior to working with Claudia, we’ve spent almost a year with another agency only to walk away with many issues & miscommunications. They were great people, just didn’t work out. Now that we’re with Claudia, the process of searching, touring communications, professionalism, and most importantly my vision of the investment that I’m searching for seems so effortless. Claudia always goes above & beyond to get things done. She texted me early in the morning when listings are available, answer questions or request anytime of the day,  and even made an appointment before the home is on the market,WOW!  I’m also one of those very picky people, everything has to be my way. Working with Claudia, how ever long it takes to find the right investment, I truly feels relax & comfortable knowing that I’m working with one of the best agent. Did I mentioned that she is SUPER knowledgeable, ethical, funny, & overall a wonderful agent & a beautiful person. If anyone needs an excellent agent with great professionalism & qualifications, you need to contact Claudia!! You will definitely have a great experience!!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Marissa R. is a great agent to help guide through the home buying process. I did research and prepared before contacting her but she always anticipated what was next and knew what questions needed to be asked before deciding on a home. I felt very comfortable and confident with her as my agent.<//Text>

We cannot recommend Luis Arellano and Yolanda De La Isla enough! If you are looking for a team who will fight for your family, negotiate the best deal while keeping your best interests then you have found the right one! We have been lucky enough to have had them represent us on a sale, but on the purchase of our first family home as well. we had ran into a few hiccups with our loan company, they pushed through, fighting for us to ensure we did not experience delays. They are so great at communicating and find a way that best fits each person. We work lots of hours and have a hard time with phone calls; they always made sure to reach out via text (our preferred communication) and Made sure we were always in the loop. They have a great understanding of the real estate market and have really adapted in the current market we are seeing. Without them our home wouldn’t have been a possibility.

They are more than real estate agents, they have become family to us. Definitely check them out!< /review>

I can’t say enough about my experience with Remax. Their services starting from the first interview, to the photography - to showings, was all too notch. Each time we had a question, the response was thorough and quick. Our house was sold quickly and above asking price. Would use their services again.< /Text>

My husband and I had a wonderful experience purchasing our invest home in Valencia from Yolanda De La Isla & Luis Arellano.  They are a dynamic duo!  They were very communicative, always followed through with each step of the process and were proactive in getting us our property during this competitive house buying market.  This is the 2nd home that this dynamic duo has helped us purchase and we highly recommend them to anyone looking for honest, hard working and trustworthy agents.</text>

<user>104570832143407808615</user><Review>The best realtor ever. At first, My wife and I were a little nervous because it was our first time buying a home and also having a realtor help us.  So it was hard for us to trust someone we didn’t know.  Our realtor Ms. Negrete was very kind and professional.  It wasn’t difficult to trust her.  She made our first time buying experience very easy and non stressful.  Bless her heart for the fact that she answered all of our questions and concerns.  She even explained at every house we visited all the details of the home.  I highly recommend Ms. Negrete as a realtor for anyone purchasing a home.  She is bilingual and a very pleasant person.  As I said before, she will answer all your questions and makes you feel secure in making those important decisions when signing.  I can keep complementing her but last thing I can say is that you won’t find a realtor like her.</Review>< resp>

Estrella picked up my sale after a refi went sideways. She was very helpful and responsive whenever I had questions and she found a buyer after only two weeks of listing over asking price! She also set up photographers with very professional photos and coordinated all of the title and escrow side. Very user friendly for a hands off person like myself.</text>

Nagla Ameerally is the best real estate agent I have ever dealt with. she is very professional, experienced, friendly and patient, she explained everything in a way that was easy to understand from the making of the offer, to working with the mortgage banker. She was always available to answer questions, it was absolutely wonderful to work with her, she made buying a house such a breeze! I highly recommend her!</Review>

I had the pleasure of working Mr. Rosas recently. He was able to answer my questions in full and was completely honest with me through the process. I appreciated his transparency and his commitment to help me with the home I was interested in. One quality I noticed that was different from others I have spoken with was his caring quality. Mr. Rosas truly cared if I was happy with his service and cared about the input I provided.<//Text>

<Review>I'm in the Air Force currently stationed in Germany, I've been talking to an agent Claudia Negrete. She's helping me find a home to rent out while I'm away. I was initially skeptical about moving back to California, she's offered me a lot of awesome options and gave me all the info I needed. Very informative. Highly reccomend.<//Review>< resp>

Claudia Negrete is a true professional with the clients best interests in mind.  She works hard to make sure that she delivers what she promises.  She's not a 9 to 5ver and goes above and beyond. If you are ready to transact real estate you won't go wrong with her.</Review>

<time>1612917510281<//time><rate>5< /rate><Text>I would like to commemorate the work ethic and exceptional character of Aurelio Osorio. He has proven time and time again that he offers world-class service that can’t be taught, but only learned through observation and mastering the art of genuine human interaction(s). He has assisted my friends and family with all of their real estate needs. Let’s be honest and clear...we all know an “agent”, but his passion drives him to be more than just an agent. I can assure you that in the process Aurelio will not only become your real estate go-to, but also your friend. He welcomes any inquiries and does an amazing job of listening to client’s needs. He has second-to-none critical thinking skills and adaptability in his approach to tackling and solving obstacles that often arise in real estate transactions. He goes above and beyond and brings you solutions instead of rebuttals. I would highly recommend Aurelio Osorio from REMAX New Dimension to anyone who is in market for anything real estate related.

<review>Sharon Vasquez is an angel sent from Heaven! She was very helpful, caring, and determined to find my mother and I a beautiful home. The hard work and dedication Sharon puts forth in helping others means the absolute world. I was in a tight spot and was in need of a new home to live in and Sharon reassured me that she will help me and do anything and everything in her power to help me the best she could. The moving process/paperwork/etc. was such a breeze with Sharon beside me. Thank you Sharon for your compassion and your time. My mother and I are so very blessed to have been under your care during this troubling and stressful time. Thank you for your hard work and dedication in finding a beautiful new home for us. You are greatly appreciated Sharon!</review></record>

Re/max New Dimension offers a great working environment. Edgar Adame, Miriam Adame and the staff are wonder people to work with. They take pride in running a successful business and help make it a win win for everyone that sets foot in the office. I appreciate the opportunity to be part of the office. Thank you!<//Review>

I could not have asked for a better experience. We were first time home buyers and were not at all familiar with the experience but she made the process very easy to understand. She was always available to answer questions day/night/weekends and we had a ton of questions for her. We probably asked her the same questions over and over again and she patiently reassured us. There wasn't a single instance where we felt pressured or at risk. If I had known buying a house would be this stress free, I'd probably done it years ago. I can't recommend Jessica enough!</text><rating>5</rating><UserId.>109801081460972724057< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80dcd97b3f1941db:0xb030e73e47efa31<//gmapID></record>

As a first time buyer, home shopping can be intimidating. I was unsure of where to start and I’m glad I ended reaching out to Aurelio. Aurelio found ways to communicate to me where things made sense. I could not have expected this quality of service. Within minutes of texting him, he responds with an answer. He’s toured me at a few homes and can’t thank him enough.<//text>

Our experience in looking for home was made smooth and unnerving with Sharon’s help, always willing to take the extra step to schedule or get us in to view a home or explaining the process till she found the right home for us. Many thanks Sharon from my family and I.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I would recommend their agent Jessica Gugliotta because she is unlike your typical agent out to chase the commission. Patient and knowledgeable, she recommended properties and answers your questions promptly. Patience is a virtue as they say and so true in Jessica’s case. Buying a home is an emotional rollercoaster and Jessica made sure that the ride was a safe experience.< /Text>< pictures>

I first contacted Jessica to inquire about a property in Huntington Beach for which she was the listing agent. What I liked about Jessica was that rather than trying to just sell me a property, she listened attentively to what I needed and made recommendations. I asked her if she could be my agent, as I was not really working with anyone. She accepted, and immediately added me to her daily reports, once she understood what my needs were in terms of type of house, area, price range, etc. Within three weeks, we had already placed an offer for a condo in Huntington Beach. She worked very closely with me, answering all my questions and requests.

This condo is a dream come true! I could not have asked for a better real estate agent and a better outcome! Thank you, Jessica!<//Text>

He was beyond professional, he became a friend of our family advocating all the time for us, solving problems, answering questions no matter the time or day of the week and answering questions over and over. He cared about our family and help us with problems he shouldn't need to deal with as part of his job, that is why we will always be so thankful with him.

< review>
Jeffery is an amazing person and a great real estate agent. He is very reliable, punctual, keeps you up to date, and is there for you any time of the day to answer your questions, even outside business hours. Jeff is very well informed, not only about house sales, but also about different types of  loans. It was very helpful to have someone who works with such a great team to create the complete package for those looking to buy a house. We had a wonderful experience. We got info applying for mortgage loans with three other places, and there was no comparison in the manner that we were treated. Jeff ultimately came out on top with the best reference for a mortgage loan. He was also very motivating throughout our home-buying ordeal, and extremely easy to work with. We highly recommend his service!< /review>

<text>Jessica and Jose were very responsive and quick to find me options that fit the criteria for a new home. They were able to adapt to my needs as I widened my search out of orange county. It was a good experience and relatively quick especially considering the current quarantine environment.</text>< Pics>

I found Claudia Negrete on Zillow and that's when our fun journey began. Couldn't have asked for a better realtor. She went above and beyond our expectations. She was the only realtor to contact me back when my family and I were looking for an agent to orient and give us direction in regards to a mobile home purchase. She responded promptly but not only that, she also connected us with our bank that specialized in such special loans and they are also awesome people at the Mortgage Loan Company she recommended us to. I love how she doesn't take no for an answer because that persistence personality that she has pays off. For some reason our community mobile home management was making it hard for us to get approved, but she put in the hard work and made it happen for us. We were approved with the community mobile park and purchased our home thanks to Claudia Negrete. My family and I couldn't thank her enough. She will definitely be our future listing and purchase agent again. Thank you Claudia.</text>

First time homebuyers and Mya Gibson helped us throughout the whole process! She never failed to do weekly follow up calls and made adjustments to our home search. She was very patient with us as we went to see multiple homes until we found the one! When our offer was accepted, she addressed all our questions and accomodated our requests. Glad we got to work with her and her team on our first home purchase!< /text>

My wife and I were continuously amazed at how helpful and knowledgeable Andrew was throughout the entire process. He rose way above our expectations, and never missed an opportunity to assist us at our convenience. He made everything happen so smoothly and flawlessly without a hitch. It really is amazing to see that level of dedication and willingness to provide a great home buying experience to people.

I would Highly recommend Andrew to anyone, no matter what kind of home you are looking to buy. You won’t regret it! Thank you Andrew!!!< /Text>

Jose and Hung are great! They helped me get the house I wanted, were patient and always responsive. They went above and beyond to get me set up, helped throughout the whole process (long and tedious), every step of the way! Even after I was settled in my new place. Hung is extra special, super hard worker and had an extra detail of giving me a gift when I purchased the home. Totally recommend!!<//review>

Let me be the first to tell you, buying your first home is terrifying. My wife and I thought we had it down. It can't be that hard right? WRONG. After spinning our wheels for about a month, a few offers rejected, we had given up all hope. We decided we needed to find an agent to assist us. That's where Chris came in. We took some time and researched about a dozen agents online, and were beyond impressed with Chris's reviews from his past clients. Upon reading through them, it was obvious that he genuinely cares about his clients happiness. Now reviews are only a part of it in my opinion, results speak even louder, and with Chris, the results speak for themselves. Chris and his team close 100+ deals a year, the average agent we've come to find out closes 4...per year. Let me spell it out, Chris and his team close 25x more homes per year than the average agent. We found the perfect home, were 1 of 7 offers, beat them all, and closed in 17 days. After asking around, I was told by a few friends/other agents that is impossible...HA! If you want to actually buy a house, not just write offers and waste time, call Chris, plain and simple.< /Text>

Sharon was very good at communicating and even secured a handyman to make some needed repairs. She is a true professional. I will definitely do business again once I’m ready to buy. I highly recommend both the agency and of course, Sharon!</Review>< user>

Hung is a great agent! He helped my husband and I purchased a home in Santa Ana. He was always available when we called and when we wanted to check out homes. The best part of this was he knew our financial situation and was able to negotiate with the seller to cover our closing cost! We love our   home now and we wouldn't be able to make the purchase without him. I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking to buy a home!</text>

As you can imagine, this will probably be one of our biggest investments that we would be making in our lifetime and it definitely helped to have someone like Hung to assist and walk us through the process.

Hung was attentive to our questions and he spent many hours showing us homes and was super flexible with our often busy work schedules. Many times, he would even show us homes late into the evening when we would be free from work. He also was not pushy at all and gave truthful advice, even if it meant him not closing the deal. He truly does look out for his clients and we are glad to have been one of his (and potentially in the future as well!)

Thank you Hung and the whole REMAX team for the smooth and easy process!< /Text>< Time>

Andrew comes with the whole package of knowledge in the business, persistence in keeping his client happy and aware of every move taken, accessible every minute, and makes sure to answer any question or makes sure to get the answer. Not only does he have a professional demeanor, but he is also an affable person. No one could have made this process as easy and smooth as Andrew and his partner. I will definitely recommend them to friends and reach out to them in the future if need be. Thank you Andrew and Jose for everything! Wishing you guys much success.< /Review>< pics>

Hung was very helpful from the beginning of our search. He’s a pleasure to work with. Easy to talk to and got answers to all the questions we had. I would also like to thank Monse who’s a part of Hung’s team. Monse helped with the Escrow and closing documents. She made things easy to understand and went over each and every document we signed at the closing table. Hung and his team are trustworthy and professional.< /Text>

<Text>Alright so let me start by saying that I have had an awesome experience so far. All together Jeffrey has helped me so much with everything. I wanted to use my VA loan and he already knew all the answers to everything I had! Even if he didn't have the answer he would figure it out. I work late nights and  he is always available to answer any questions I had out of the blue. Everything has been smooth sailing! During house searching we put in an offer and I don't know how he did it but we got the seller to agree to just about everything! The counter was to good to refuse and so we decided to take it. Now I am starting escrow!!! Thank you so much for all of your knowledge!!!

Jose and Lamar are a great tag team! As we know the real estate market can be very demanding but these 2  were always there to answer any questions! Jose with a very high energy and motivated you to stay hungry in buying a home and Lamar bringing a slick, calm demeanor to help stay focused with nice to deal with! As first time buyers we needed both characters! Would 100% recommend these 2 to anyone, I’m sure the rest of the office is just as good!</text>

<Review>Professional, informative, prompt, and delightful. These are just a few of the phrases that I would use to describe my experience  buying my home with Brittany. She didn’t make me just feel like a client but really like a friend who had my best interest at heart. She was with me every step of the way and She made sure that I got the best bang for my buck. I couldn’t be happier  for selecting her as my realtor and I couldn’t be happier with the home that she found for me. Thank you so much Brittany and may you be As big as a blessing to  to your many future clients as you were to me!<//Review><username>Janet’s Planet (Adama)</username>< resp>

Also Hung is very knowledgeable and easy to get a hold of caring and efficient.

<review>Agent Estrella Arellano (Ella) is very organized, she’s easy going and doesn’t pressure you! She’s very easy to get a hold of and listens to you. And because she listens to you, house searching is great and not a waste of your time.  It feels like your home search is a priority to her she is always so friendly, you never feel any push back or attitude. She is always very helpful.  Others like her and work well with her which helps us especially when its negotiating time.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I met Jeffery Mcgonigle at an open house. Right away, I could spot his enthusiasm and found him to be very resourceful. There, he took the time to assess my economic situation and my expectations, and offered the guidance and the help that my family and I needed to become first time home owners. In  the weeks to come, Jeff followed up with us, sending listing after listing, maintaining open communication throughout the process. I am forever thankful for the persistent effort and positive energy that Jeffery has brought to the table! Thanks to Jeff and his associates, we are finally in escrow with the house of our dreams, and currently experiencing one of the happiest moments in our lives!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

We required quite a bit of hand holding, guidance and insight during this process. Hung not only provided us with all of that, but was genuinely happy to do so and always provided quick and amazing service. He quickly learned what we were looking for and helped us find our perfect home. He works with a team of skilled partners and made everything as smooth and seamless as possible. He truly went above and beyond in every aspect. Hung will be the only realtor we work with moving forward and will receive every possible referral from us! If you’re looking for the best guy to help you through this process, Hung is the one! I can’t thank him enough for all of his patience, effort and support!<//Text>< Pics>

We used Hung for our real estate needs. He did not shy away from our questions and when we wanted to see homes, it did not matter what time it was. Being first time home buyers, he guided us through the whole process and made everything easy to understand! Glad we found him as our realtor.< /Text>

Talk about an amazing agency! I've worked with Re/Max in Santa Ana many times over the span of a couple years purchasing homes. This last home the team at Re/Max helped me purchase went so smoothly. They found the perfect home I was looking for and really helped me get exactly what I wanted!

Edgar and his team are amazing!!! Thank you!<//Review>

<Text>Andrew and his team were very helpful. He is also up front and honest and never just told us what we wanted to hear. We had a tall order to fill as we are a lRge blended family and he made it happen. He always goes above and beyond for us and did a ton of leg work to ensure we were getting exactly what we wanted. I am so impressed that for once we had someone who genuinely cared about our feeling as well as our hopes as opposed to someone pushing their own agenda. We worked with someone else before him and unfortunately that individual had his own agenda. Andrew is a exactly who we needed, so blessed!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

LAMAR , where do I even start explaining how great this guy is . Patient, caring and knowledgeable. It took me and my girl 4 months to find the right home for us and Lamar stayed working hard to make sure we found the right place . It was awesome working with him . He communicated with us frequently and always made sure we were comfortable before making any decisions. For anyone looking for a home, Lamar is the guy you should work with . I would reccomend him to all my friends and family.< /text>

<review>This review is for Jose and Brittany, both of whom I highly recommend. I brought them in to help my parents sell the home they lived in for over 40 years, and to look for a new, smaller home in the area. They were very professional, knowledgeable and treated us like family. They were great about keeping me informed as my parents have never sold a home before and wanted my input. Jose and Brittany were also wonderful with explaining the process to my parents, answering all of their questions and ensuring that they were comfortable with what was going on, both with the selling of their former home and the purchase of their new one. It was nice for me to know that they were being well taken care of, and I am so thankful for that.

José and Brittany recommended a great contractor to paint and install carpet and secured a moving company when the time came. They did a wonderful job marketing the listing ahead of time and generating a lot of interest...my parents had 7 offers within just a few days! I’ve never had agents go the extra mile quite like these two.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I'm one not to write reviews but it's a must to do so just by the amazing experience I had. To keep a long story short my wife and are first time home buyers. We had no clue in what we were doing. Our first Relator from a different company was just not listening to what we wanted and we felt pressured.

Then we met Claudia Negrete and Jessica Gugliotta and boy I'm glad we did. If you want someone to walk you through the process and truly sit down and give you full attention to your needs, look no more they are  the duo you want on your side. They are super easy to work with and very knowledgeable in their profession. They are not just looking to make a quick buck and put you in any home. They truly do care on finding your specific needs even if you are texting them at midnight. Truly made my family and I feel like family and turned our experience a total 360 degrees for the best. If your looking for a Realtor to sell or buy look no more because Claudia, Jessica and their team not only truly know what they are doing they treat you like family. THANK YOU for helping me find my forever home!!!!</Review>

As a first time home buyer, I did not know where to start and Hung was very helpful and knowledgeable to explain and walk me through the whole process. He was very patient and willing to answer any questions I had and to go extra steps to make my life easier. Thank you Hung!<//Review>

Andrew have been of great help for us in our home buying process. We are first time home buyer and had very limited knowledge. Andrew have been with us throughout the home buying process in person and have visited our site multiple times. Andrew is very knowledgeable and understand the process. I highly recommend Andrew and his team.</Text>

Needed consultation on how best to proceed with selling and purchasing of a property, and the financial considerations around such transactions. Heather provided several key pieces that I had not considered that proved to be helpful.</Text>

As a first time home buyer I did not know what to expect. I am so glad I met Jeffery. He made sure I understood everything regarding the home purchase. There was a lot of documents that came into the process, Jeff sat me down at his office to go over it with me. He made a complex process into something very easy. I would highly recommend Jeff to anyone who is looking to purchase a home in OC.</Text>

<time>1563565832925</time><rating>5<//rating><text>We purchased our home with them and it was overall a great experience.  We wanted something very particular, and the realtors here listed to us and actually recommended great homes for us too see, we went into escrow after finding the perfect house on our very first outing with them.    In addition to all of that, they also got us the lowest interest rates that were offered to us with AFN which was their preferred lender and we quickly got approved and then closed the deal.  It was all very quick and easy, and most of all there where no unexpected surprises or hang-ups.  10/10 would use again and will definitely refer both services to our friends and family.  Thanks for everything!< /text>< pictures>

Focused on customer satisfaction, Chris is realistic and transparent on facts that benific the consumer. A huge advocate for home ownership & retention, you will only get honest answers & great service.

Using multiple sources to provide facts to the consumer, Chris is always focused on educating the client on making the right choice for their situation.  I endorse all the work they do for the consumer.<//review>

My husband and I are so happy that we connected with Chris and his team to purchase our first home. The whole thing has been incredibly smooth and we are positive we are in good hands. He takes care of everything and has made sure we understand exactly what we are doing (I can't say the same for   our previous agent). Chris is always very accessible and responds to all calls/texts almost instantly. Chris, if you're reading this, when our transaction is done take a vacation and leave your phone at home! We consider ourselves blessed to have found Chris, and can't wait to open escrow!<//Review>

<Review>As a first time home buyer, words cannot explain how glad I am to have found this team to help my family and I. I thought it was going to be a very stressful process but they made it very easy. Especially Christopher Giannos, he went the extra mile for my family. He was always available for our questions and showings. We went through two other agents but they are nothing in comparison to Christopher
and his team. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to purchase a home.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563557435145, 'text': 'We appreciate your feedback, thank you so much for trusting us with your home buying/selling needs!'}</Resp>< gmapID>

I should have used Chris from the moment I first spoke with him months ago. I tried to do it myself and failed and cost not only myself money but my family. If you want to sell your house call Chris and tell him Steve sent you. We had tons of problems a long the way and Chris never even batted an eye, he just found a solution and kept going. Well done Chris.<//Text>

<Text>Chris has two speeds fast and faster... he really seeks to understand what exactly you are looking for and more importantly, why.

His knowledge of the southern California real estate market is unparalleled and extensive.

Upon finding you a home, Chris game plans with you exactly how to get that   home. His deep understanding of how to effectively negotiate goes much farther than other agents I've consulted.

Chris, you are the man!< /Text>< Pictures>

I talked to a few agents before coming across Hugo's profile but none gave me the comfort of knowing that my purchase was going to be in good hands. His professionalism and knowledge of the market was superb! He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole process making me feel like I knew exactly what I was doing. I will definitely be working with Hugo in the future and strongly recommend him to anyone looking to buy their next home!</review>

Working with Chris Giannos was absolutely amazing! Most agents are looking to only close a deal as quickly as they can but not Chris. He's patient, knowledgeable, and understanding. He took time to truly understand my needs and educated me after recognizing my lack of experiencing to ensure I was making a informed decision. He's professional and truly cares about putting families in homes fitting of their lifestyle. I'll definitely be calling him when it's time for my families forever home.<//text>

Ever since my first day, I knew what a great opportunity it was to be apart of this RE/MAX New Dimension Family! All the agents have such a wide range of knowledge of the industry and go so above and beyond to help each and every individual they come across. They put in 110% everyday, with such drive and passion to assist and guide they're clients and also each other. I love being in this office because the energy is so amazing everyone is functioning so fast with such high spirits! Team Adame makes moves! You can feel confident that  your expectations will be exceeded and your next home buying or selling experience can be one that you trust!< /Text>

We have had a very positive experience working with Edgar and his office at REMAX New Dimension.  At first we were nervous about working with a realtor that was new to us and we knew little about.  Edgar quickly made us feel at ease and confident in his abilities.  He responded quickly to every phone call, e-mail, or text we sent him and always had an answer or a solution to any issue we presented.  Edgar went the extra mile to provide us with as much information as he could regarding the sale or our rental property and now, with the purchase of another rental.  The two transactions have gone very smoothly, with very little stress, pressure or work or our side.  Edgar and his team have taken care of everything and have kept the transactions moving quickly and efficiently.  Edgar is not only responsive to our every need, but he is proactive in identifying needs that may arise and in suggesting the best ways to take care of them.  We are very grateful to have found Edgar and will definitely call on him again the next time we need a realtor.  I would highly recommend Edgar as a knowledgeable, helpful, and responsive expert in his field.< /text>

<Review>I contacted Chris and three other agents I found on Zillow to sell a property my family owns. After interviewing the first 3 it was clear all real estate agents really are created equal...then Chris walked in. Something about the way he carries himself really does portray him being the absolute   best hands down. I was impressed with his presentation and the fact that when hiring him, not only was I getting him, but an entire team of people dedicated to making sure the job got done. I have been nothing but impressed every step along the way, and look forward to closing escrow soon!</Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

<Review>I am so happy I found Chris! We have gone through 3 agents trying to find my mom a house in Little Saigon. We finally found Chris after stumbling across a blog post about why choosing the right agent to represent you is VITAL in the hot OC market. Living in NJ and trusting someone to drive you  elderly mother around 2500 miles away is difficult to say the least, but Chris has earned not only our trust but our business.We haven't been able to nail a property down yet, but I hear from Chris every single day regardless if it's good news or bad news. Chris, I want to say thank you for making this so easy. We appreciate you more than words can express</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Hugo was very professional but also personable at the same time.  He was very responsive and willing to help in anyway he could.  He really made this stressful process go much smoother than anticipated.  He even responded from the hospital when his wife was having a baby
(shh don't tell her).  Would definitely recommend him!</Text>

Amazing, stunning, marvelous, unbelievable and down to earth....these are the words that I would use to describe the #dreamteam at Remax real estate agency. Right from the beginning, all my questions were answered and my concerns were addressed in a timely manner. Further, flexibility wasn't an issue ( I work full time) and the office atmosphere and real estate agents have a positive dynamic/vibe. Andrew and Chris were extremely instrumental in assisting me in finding and purchasing my first home. I can't thank you guys enough!</Review>

<Review>We just had our first anniversary at our new home and none of these wouldn't have happened without the help of Claudia Negrete.  She made the selling and buying of our homes stress free and walked us through all the processes to ensure nothing was missed.  We highly recommend Claudia for any of your needs when buying or selling a home.</Review>< pics>

Chris and his team are so beyond awesome to work with. Their skill, level of communication, ability to work through gnarly situations and patience is top tier. Everything Chris said would happen, did. That is such a rare thing these days...

We are so stoked with our new home. It wasn't the easiest  buying experience (not because of Chris) but with him at the wheel we are sure that it was so much easier than it could have been.

We feel very blessed to have worked with Chris & RE/MAX NEW Dimension.<//review>

Hugo Pompa and Jeffery Mcgonigle are two of the best guys you could ask for when selling and/or buying property. Not only are they cordial and professional, they are also brutally honest...and that's the way it should be. Home selling and buying can be overwhelming and frustrating, but also satisfying and worthwhile. Hugo and Jeff are easily accessible and helpful (answering texts and calls at all hours of the day) listening to concerns/questions and giving recommendations/advice. We understand that those in the real estate industry (realtors/brokers/lenders/etc) are in it to make money, but I have always felt and believed that Hugo and Jeff are looking out for our best interest. Even after the sale and purchase of our previous and new homes, respectively, they have been there for us. As a recent example, we had a plumbing problem. Guess who was there to help answer questions and be there first thing in the morning with a plumber?...Hugo and Jeff! Also, we have kids. Hugo and Jeff are caring, thoughtful, and very accommodating people that made everything work when we had to bring our kids along (showing our property, house hunting, filling out paperwork, finalizing deals). I would definitely recommend them to anyone that's in the market to buy or sell. I already tell all my friends and family about our experience, and how they should look to Hugo and Jeff for the same experience. They fulfilled their jobs, successfully helped us sell and buy our homes...but they are true friends to us, like brothers!</text>

<review>The RE/MAX New Dimension Agents are the best!!!  They were able to sell our home immediately after listing it.  We are very pleased with the whole process.  Miriam and Alexis handled the escrow diligently while Edgar was able to communicate accordingly with the buyers agent to make it a smooth and pleasant transaction.  The open house was very successful and generated multiple offers thanks to their RE/MAX Realtors David and Hugo.  We are very grateful and pleased to have chosen such a dynamic team of realtors. It has been a superb proceeding and we highly recommend the Adame Team to negotiate your future real estate ventures.

I didn't know anyone in the real estate industry here and honestly felt a little lost and upside down. Chris was the   first person I met (through Zillow) and he gave me hope I'd meet some other great people here with his friendliness and professionalism. Chris listened to what I wanted/needed and found me the perfect condo in an area I loved in just a couple days. He did all the scheduling for me and made viewing the condos really easy. In the end, he found me a condo that had only been on the market for 8 hours. We snatched it up quick! Sorry y'all, I got to it first! :) After that I had a couple questions on all the closing docs I had to fill out and he helped us with everything we needed to get me through the closing process. Great agent. Great experience. I would definitely recommend him to anyone!<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
On New Year's Eve, at 7:00 PM I was browsing the Zillow app on my phone and found a piece of land that would be perfect for my construction yard. I called the number listed and someone from zillow picked up and asked if I wanted to talk to an agent, I was surprised and said yes...I was connected   with Chris and immediately impressed with his knowledge of the zoning codes here in Santa Ana. This is not my first time working with a realtor and most times I'm telling them the codes. The lot ended up being zoned exactly what I needed so we wrote up an offer! I look forward to Chris representing me again in the future.< /Review>

<time>1563403396346<//time><pics>None</pics><review>Buying a home is by far the most intimidating experience we’ve faced, one that we anticipated would require a substantial amount of time and effort.

Referred to us by a friend, we contacted Mr. Jeff McGonigle of Team Adame Re/Max to be our guide in this seemingly daunting process. Electing Jeff to be our agent turned out to be the wisest decision in this entire process! With his help and guidance at every step of the way, this daunting task became a seamless, quick, and most importantly, enjoyable experience.

Jeff was great through the entire process. He was able to put together a list of amazing properties that not only met our financial and locational constraints, but also our personal taste.  When we finally found our dream home he was diligent in making sure we got the best deal possible. We feel that Jeff really treated us as family and that he had our best interest in mind every step of the way.

Jeff’s amazing personality and calm demeanor were instrumental in moving the process forward. There were no obstacles that couldn’t be surpassed, and all problems had solutions. Mr. McGonigle was always a phone call or message away- it truly feels like he runs a 24/7/365 operation!

We are deeply appreciative of Jeff’s diligence in making this possible. We absolutely recommend his services to anyone looking to purchase a home!

Thank You Jeff for all your help!< /review>< GmapID>

I would definitely refer and recommend him as a real estate agent in searching for the ultimate buying experience for you and your family

If you were to look up Chris Giannos in the dictionary, there would be two definitions (as he's a very ambiguously talented individual). Definition 1: arguably the most intelligent, well read, savage realtor in all of the County of Orange. Definition 2: A close confidant, friend, and advisor for years to come. Meeting Chris through Zillow was pure luck of the draw in my opinion, although he will attribute it to the massive amount of money they spend on advertising (take note potential sellers). I will continue working with Chris indefinitely and would happily shout his name from the rooftops in hopes that anyone currently working with a realtor would ditch the zero and get with the hero. Chris, you're my hero......kidding, but in all honesty THANK YOU!</Review>

Throughout the past several months, Hugo Pompa has been there every step of the way. He has always answered every call or text no matter what  time of the day or night it was. His professionalism, mentorship, knowledge, honesty and hard work ethic are much respected and appreciated. He was a mentor to answer questions and help us through the whole process.
I would highly recommend him to anyone that is searching for a home or even thinking of putting there home on the market. Thanks again Hugo and ReMax team for being such a pleasure to work with.</review>

I was able to connect with Mr. Giannos through Zillow and was immediately impressed with his local level knowledge and candor. Being self employed, I was under the impression buying a home was almost impossible. THEN, I met Chris...Not only did he clearly illustrate that it IS possible, but   educated me every step along the way. Although we haven't put it together 100%, we are very close and I felt the need to share my story. If you're looking to buy ANYTHING at ANYTIME call Chris. If it's a house, he's your guy...if it's anything else, he probably has a guy!</text>

< Review>
My realtor was Chris Giannos, so this review pertains to my experience with his services:
Overall, I was not at pleased with his work on my behalf.
Things started off well enough, in that he was willing to visit any home of interest promptly. One early issue is that I felt strongly pushed by him to look only in the Santa Ana area, in spite of my expressed interest to try to look for something similarly affordable in other areas. I don't know if this was intentional, but it felt that he didn't work hard to find homes that met all or most of my criteria.
I made an offer on one home through Chris' in-house lender, but I later found that their rates were not very competitive. I was disappointed to discover this, and switched to my own choice. I assume there is some sort of cut that Chris' office gets from this arrangement, thought they assured me this wasn't the case. Regardless, someone is taking more money than is typical.
The home that I ended up buying, I found on the MLS site myself. It was an area that he had never discussed, despite it fitting all of my criteria (price, distance from work, safety, home size, etc.). I pointed it out to Chris, and he promptly joined me at the home. I feel like I did the creative work of finding an affordable home that fit my other criteria, but I thought that was part of what I paid Chris for.
So, I decided to make an offer, which was an easy process, due to all of the e-documents and such. The offer was accepted. Conditions of sale included the seller doing some work. The terms of this arrangement were not appropriately conveyed to me. After all was said and done, the work was completed 2 months after we closed. This means that I paid 2 months of mortgage without living in the house. There was never any mention that it would be this much of an inconvenience, nor was there any mention of financial compensation.
On top of this, I didn't even get the keys until over a week after closing the sale. This is something that Chris should have taken care of on day 1, from my understanding. Instead, I couldn't get a hold of him, and had to go through the listing agent to figure out what happened. Strangely enough, Chris just decided to get the house re-keyed a week after close. The action is normal, but the timing was odd. The lack of communication was frustrating.
I also didn't learn any unique details about the home from Chris' office. I would think that they would dig into renovation history, price history, etc. This is my first home purchase, so maybe I'm just expecting too much, but if I'm getting no unique expert perspective, I don't see much value added beyond processing documents and getting access to tour homes.
Another issue that I had to deal with was that the work done on the house left it in an unlivable state (carpet was cut and lifted, and left there). I was not told this would be this case. Chris did nothing to handle this until after I paid to have this fixed out of pocket. This was all after spending 2 months of mortgage and not living in the house, so you would expect a more sensitive approach from your realtor. I really felt like I was left hanging as soon as the sale was closed.
There were just a lot of things that added up to a less than pleasant experience, and at the end of the day, I don't think Chris offered any value beyond the absolute basics: visiting homes and handling the signings of documents. I had to spend quite a bit of effort to monitor or manage many stages, which was very frustrating. 2 stars for being able to close the deal and negotiate the work, but the missing 3 are for nothing else going well. I recommend you look elsewhere for an agent, based on my experience.</Review>

Andrew Giannos & Jose Samano are fantastic agents with extensive knowledge of local inventory.
Remax New Dimension is experienced process-wise, and they were excellent in our purchase process.
They kept us informed every step of the way, treated all participants in the process with respect and were a delight to work with. I would recommend them without reservation. We are clients for life.< /Text>

<Review>It's difficult to say what makes Chris a standout in the vast sea of realtors in OC. Having worked with several agents in the past, I've got a pretty good idea of how sub par these people can be. Chris completely changed my perspective on what to expect. From the second I contacted him, I was blown   away by his responsiveness, genuine interest in assisting me, and unparalleled knowledge of the market here in OC. Not only was he able to list and sell my property for a record price in the community, but worked with me to clearly illustrate how to net as much as possible on the back end. Regardless of where you are in Orange County, Chris's marketing ability and more importantly sales skills will go to work for you in a way no other agent can. Thanks again Chris, I found not only a realtor for life, but a friend.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1554409541387, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to leave a review, Tran!

My husband and I have been working with Edgar and Miriam Adame for the past 10 years . We have always gone to The Adames for advice and their guidance. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank  both Miriam and Edgar Adame for all their help and support! When we recently decided to put our house up on the market we knew we could count on Both of them. We have referred all of our Family and Friends  to them  and always had a professional experience and a fabulous outcome. Thank you for making this difficult time in our life run smooth :) thank you for always responding to us and answering all of our questions.<//review>

Words cannot express our DEEP appreciation for our amazing realtor HUGO POMPA & our wonderful loan officer CARLOS PEREZ. Hugo was professional, FAST, QUICK thinker & problem SOLVER when it came to purchasing our first home. He made all the RIGHT moves (no pun intended lol) literally to get us in our new home. When we thought there was NO way of possibly seeing ourselves in our new home, Hugo took initiatives to conquer one thing & that was to make myself & husband home owners. We could not thank Hugo or Carlos enough! Our realtor was referred over to us from our loan officer CARLOS PEREZ whom did his job to a "T". Professional at what he does, Carlos made sure all our i's were dotted & T's crossed which made the process that much easier! This whole process is what EVERY client would want for their experience at the end..SMOOTH! Thanks, CARLOS, HUGO & everyone @ the remax new dimension team!<//text>
