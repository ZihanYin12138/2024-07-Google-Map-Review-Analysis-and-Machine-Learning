One of the worst internet service providers. Can’t have one month without a 10hr outage. Speeds typically perform 10-20mb below package advertised. Prices are outrageous for this level of quality. It’s the 21 century guys, come on.

Edit: customer service is pretty rad 😎<//review>

Have had digital path for a year now and it has been the WORST experience. I pay 150$ a month for continuous outages, barely 10 mbps speed during the day, and can’t play online games at all. Called about 20 times with hope that maybe they’ll fix their issue and every single time it’s the same exact thing with absolutely zero help. To make a long story short, they will never help you. You will still have your same issues with the same poor slow internet speed. I am also Downgrading to the most basic package because there’s no point in wasting 150$, Let alone paying, for internet service like this.<//review>

Iv been with them for over 7 years, paying 80+ dollars a month for 6mp/s download speed is absolutely the worse. Whats funny is that every now and then my speeds magically go up to 14-23Mp/s even though they claim they cant offer anything higher than 6Mp/s. This really is the scummiest ISP ever, if you can please go with Xfinity or anyone else really.<//text>

I live in a rural area where one would not expect to get anything except satellite or maybe a poor cellular data connection.  DigitalPath able to find line of sight to a local tower on the top of one of my trees on which they installed an antenna. I work at home and use the internet intensively, mainly Remote Desktop, VoiP/Conferencing and Email.  High bandwidth is not a requirement, but low latency and stable uptime are a big deal. My first few weeks of service i experienced regular dropouts and loss of service which would cause painful work interruptions.  I worked with their tech support to troubleshoot the issue and they determined the cause was likely with the antenna/tree equipment.  The climbers came back out and after a second trip up the tree, my connection has been stable with zero drop outs for over 2 weeks now.

I have been on the phone several times for various reasons, each time the wait time was reasonable (with audio prompts telling you how people are in the queue before you).  In addition they update their initial tech-support greeting with today's date and a summary of known outages.

This morning I woke to a service outage, I called the support line and learned right off the bat that there was an outage in my area and included an estimate time of service restoration. No need to even speak to a tech.  I headed into town and worked at a coffee shop and after returning home I am writing this up using my DigitalPath connection.

These guys are top notch at communication and the service is just what I need for working in the tech world from the middle of a forest. A+++

I am on the 10 Mbps / 2 Mbps plan which is delivered as advertised.

One other thing to note.  If you plan on relying on this kind of service the way I do, you should consider that this kind of technology is heavily reliant on atmospheric conditions.  Plan to have a backup if you have any mission critical tasks that depend on the internet.  If you have line of sight and these guys can't make it work, you probably need to explore other options.< /review>

<Review>By far the worst ISP I have worked with for so many reasons: First and foremost their speeds and service are poor. I pay $120/mo for 10Mbps internet with a datacap, yet I rarely get the speeds I pay for! The connection drops so frequently that I cannot rely on it for calls.

When I call to talk to tech support they are apathetic to the issue. I have requested credit refunds which go to a different department and that they will not let you talk to. They rarely every credit you for poor service or outages. Many times I have requested a call-back to and they never reach back out. Tech support rarely can do anything except tell you to wait.

There were issues with my dish making my connection completely unusable. They told me it would be 2-weeks before I could get someone out! They prioritize installing *new* customers before fixing their existing customers service. Turns out there were ants in the dish, you should really make a dish that is properly sealed. I want to pull my hair out.

I cannot wait until companies like Starlink put them out of business.

Update: DP never resolved any of my issues. I finally got Starlink internet and it's blazing fast. I just canceled my DigitalPath service. It's really funny...digital path is faster to get a crew out to take down my equipment than they were to come out and repair it. I will never forget that they prioritized scheduling crews to set up new service than they did repairing my broken service. Good riddance!!</Review>< pictures>

Very poor service, no call back when I questioned why it would take a week to get someone out to repair. Then after changing  my plans to be available  "the technician was hurt on an earlier job" we don't have anyone else to send. Next available is 5 days away.  Are you kidding me? I  see plenty of "owner responses in these reviews most look like cut and paste. Perhaps just pay attention to customer care would improve ratings!<//text>

<Text>Dustin is awesome!  I had a very great experience today with a technician that came out to my house to fix some equipment issues causing all kinds of latency & bandwidth lags.  Dustin actually spent 40 mins trying to find my house and he didn't give up - due to my error of not notifying my neighbors in my rural area.  Nevertheless, he still managed to get out here and install a bunch of new equipment as my equipment was obsolete, and with complete transparency - he showed me the signal from the dish to the larger dish, the signal from the dish to my power outlet, and then the signal from my PoE adapter as well.  After he was finished, he even had me verify with speedtest that he had improved the connection here.  I am truly impressed by Dustin's work ethic and hope it doesn't go unnoticed as he just left my house as it is now dark outside, because he efficiently got the cables and mounting equipment going along with my new dish.  After he finished, my latency/ping is now a SINGLE DIGIT and it's never been that fast in the last few years... Thanks Dustin and Digital Path!  Although a review can only accomplish so much - I hope this is a testament to his great work ethic and Digital Path''s ability to spot great talent like Dustin!<//Text>< rate>

<userid>109486314531282861717</userid><Review>The entire neighborhood has digital path and not a single neighbor is happy. When i get home in the evening, the internet is slow and cant watch TV without lag. They will make excuses and try to say things that are generic or not true. When the internet goes down, there is no tech support after 9pm. So if you need to do work or school stuff, you're out of luck. They charge $100 plus, but can't compete with service or support that others offer. It's been stress full because their internet doesn't work fast enough for smart home devices. Fiber Optic or cable internet is the way to go if you have a choice.<//Review>< Rating>

We decided to upgrade and couldn’t wait to for the new equipment and the day finally arrived ... the technician came out and did a fantastic job, he went above and beyond to make sure the signal was good, well more than good , excellent and came in to do the wires for inside and hooked everything up. The service has been great, so far were happy and the company itself tries to make things right and they listen . The tech support people are very savy in what they do and know. All in all we are very happy we choose Digital Path for our need. 👍🏼</review>

<Review>Support staff are most pleasant but they don’t have control over this unreliable internet service. There is often problems with their towers/equipment.  Unfortunately, I live in a rural area and this is what I have.  I work from home and when I lose internet, I have to use my vacation leave and the reimbursement from Digital Path for the lost day of internet doesn’t compare to the cost of my lost leave. Also, with the current fires, I would not be able to get cell alerts without my internet. Scary.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I just tried to talk with Eric at tech support regarding an ongoing slow internet speed. Mainly at night and sometimes morning. I have called in several times in the past with friendly and nice technicians and recently had this problem. It seems that it is interference with a radio at Beale? He said it's fine now and that there is nothing he can do about that. He was short with me and not accommodating at all. If I call back I hope I do not get him. He was rude.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Gmap_id>0x8082d9a6f1e36f11:0x8e88f2f532b001a9<//Gmap_id><Review>I have rarely encountered a company that is so dispassionate about attending to its customers or providing quality service.  I had DP service for two years, and it was never good.  Sometimes I had to call daily for weeks straight to have them continually reset/reroute my service.  They made no site visits and no attempts at permanently correcting the issue, and generally just shrugged it off.  After I canceled for 6 months and tried an LTE service, I decided to give DP another shot because they told me they had cleared space on their towers.  The tech who came out to restart my service checked my dish (still installed) and told me my signal wasn't good enough for them to provide service.   Now, theoretically this could have been due to tree growth, but trees don't grow that much in two years.  The tech told me that the previous installer had probably fudged the numbers to make my service look good.  And I paid for that trash for two years.  Thanks Digital Path!  Look forward to StarLink coming online and putting you out of business.

EDIT: As you can likely see below, DigitalPath immediately responded to my initial review promising that they were "so sorry", "looking into details" and would be in touch "within 1-2 business days to discuss the best possible outcome".  What an impressive response time! Surely, you say, they must have taken this opportunity to rectify the situation, possibly issue a refund, or at least had the decency to follow up with a call.  Surely they wouldn't have the nerve to make additional promises to an already-dissatisfied customer and then expect the customer wouldn't notice the lapse.  Normally, yes, you'd think that a business would care enough about repairing the impact of its embarrassingly bad service, or that at least they'd leave bad enough alone.  Ahh, my friend, I can see how you'd think these things, but clearly you have not had the pleasure of being "served" by DigitalPath.  Because if you had, you would know that they never called, and that this is representative of their approach to just about everything.< /Review>< Time>

<Text>I admit...in years past I have only just “put up” with bad internet and have stuck with Digital Path for 8 years, but if this is the case for you try again!  We had the best experience getting our service upgraded and couldn’t be happier with the new speeds, data caps, and even better prices!

<text>I live in rural Yuba County, we have limited internet options.  We decided to try Digital Path as it offered faster service at a better price.  Grant & Jessie came out yesterday and set up our service.  Grant was extremely helpful and answered all our questions.

We had a little glitch this morning, but it did not pertain to the set up.  All is good and it seems to be extremely fast.< /text></record>

A pretty easy fix I could have done for about 10$. Anyway not a bad service just be careful about service charges.

<text>Unprofessional, terrible speeds. Zero stars if possible.They wrote up a service ticket for me on 08/08/2020 but never called back I called (08/18/20) today to get my speeds fixed Eric the tech on call refused to do anything because according to him service ticket means I can't help you despite other techs willing to help out as much as they can cause service calls can take up to a month to come out.  Today Eric gives me my service ticket number than just hangs up even though I wasn't done talking.  Its been 10 days since the ticket was written with no call back. When the service ticket was written I was told it had to be approved and when it is Id receive a call back with my service ticket number to schedule a service date. Never got a call. I was also told that service call can take up to a month (which is a whole another issue) so id want to schedule as soon as i get my ticket number.  My wife called a few weeks back about our speeds and a new female tech told my wife they might have to move the dish on a tree and my wife said IDK we would have to think about it because we are already paying 158 a month but putting it on a tree adds another 15 dollars a month and her response to my wife was "well you need internet dont you". Ive been with digital path for 4 years. I admit it has its up and downs literally but the price we pay for a contract that says "up too 10 mbps"  and never really is 10 mbps. For me, to be treated like this by these unprofessional techs is hard pill to swallow. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a few techs who are always so helpful like Josh and the tech who originally wrote up the service ticket. But other than that I hate dealing with tech support even though I have to do it almost regularly it seems to be able to use my internet instead of my backup hotspot. I dont recommend digital path to anyone.</text>< pics>

Their name should be DigitalTRASH not DigitalPath. This is THE WORST internet/customer service on the planet. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.  Will be cancelling my service soon. Their customer service and technical support are by far the worst I've ever had to speak/deal with. I suggest saving your money/time & looking for other better ways/companies to keep/stay connected. They dont return calls, they lie about issues, their internet service has gotten worse instead of better, their customer service is non existent. Cant wait to never have to deal with these crooks again.<//Text>

<Review>Just had an upgrade (new install and service plan) to the new Gen7 system... And WOW! what a difference... so much faster than under the old plan and am looking forward to a bandwidth increase of over 3 times. The tech, Grant Ward, did an excellent job throughout the installation, persisting thru a compromised cable from the old install and doing a complete replacement and testing of the new system until it was clearly at its advertised capacity. Questions I had were answered thoroughly and politely during the install and now WOW! Thanks, Grant, GOOD JOB!</Review><Response>{'time': 1581123560957, 'text': "Hello Wayne, thanks for taking the time to give us feedback!

Derek from the new service department was amazing.  Helpful, explained in detail and helped us pick the right plan for us.  The tech arrived on time and spend what I consider a long period of time picking the best place to install our receiver for the best reception.  He was friendly and helpful in explaining the technology.  I can't be happier with my experience.</text>

I would like to say on the second visit for install Dustin went above and beyond to try and get the gen 7 signal. He wasn't able to but dialed in the gen 6 system very quickly and explained it all very well. I would easily have given 5 stars had the first installer been as good and also the price point for gen 6 vs gen 7  is higher which seems odd. Overall speeds are everything they said although this is the first day. Thanks (DUSTIN ROCKS) DigitalPath.<//review>

<Text>I am a customer... need tech help.. they will not pick up the phone.   Poor equipment on Nimshew they will not replace or adjust. Digital path call me!

Update:
Spent 15 minutes on hold, for tech, #4 option.  Only to get a voicemail option.
Called back, option 3 thus time. Still no joy.
I had requested management to call me during my hour. No joy, no service, no support. NO INTERNET SERVICE.
Been a loyal customer.
But  I am fed up with digital path.

We have had digital path for 2 1/2 yrs. Summertime is the worst, it shuts down at 6 p.m. every night till about 9:30 p.m. in the winter it shuts down at night and sometimes during the afternoon. Had a tech out they told us we needed a new router.. bought a new router its still doing the same thing. We pay $120 for a service that works only half the time. I would not recommend digital path to anyone living in Chester, CA. It is the worst and they won't give you a break on cost even thought they can't deliver there service. They are the absolute worst.......</text>

So my husband wanted me to give it no stars since we have NO service. Somehow we manage to go through 500GB per month. We have reached out and have been unable to find out what’s drawing all this data. They claim it’s due to the PlayStation, which we’ve unplugged, doing automatic downloads. Despite unplugging we’ve seen no improvement. We get that we live in a rural community here in Chester but they claim their service is the best..... please prove this to us. We are tired of red spinning circles in this house. Raker is our last name. Would love to follow this up with a five star review stating that the issue has been fixed.</Review>

We are unable to troubleshoot on here, but we did look up your account and it looks like you are using a lot more data than you current plan supports. Once you hit your data limit in a billing cycle, your speeds will be reduced to 10% of the normal speed. We typically have 2 options in a situation like this: First, we are happy to troubleshoot more with you on what could be using up all of your data. From experience, we have seen the following things use a lot of data very quickly: a) customers with one or more wireless router(s) that are not password protected or neighbors having your wireless password and using your data without you knowing it; b) 4K or HD video streaming on one or more devices. The more devices used at the same time, the faster you eat up your data. This is usually the main cause of large data consumption for our customers; c) watching satellite TV ON DEMAND movies or shows, because they actually use your internet connection to stream the movies; d) video game downloads or updates. There are others also but that is a good start to look at. A second option if it turns out this is actual usage after investigating more, is to look at upgrading to our 1,000GB plan for another $25/month that would better support your current data usage so that you do not have your speeds slowed to 10% of normal half way through your billing cycle like has been happening to you the last few months. We are happy to help with either option you would like to explore. We will have our tech support manager reach out to you to figure out the best course of action. Thank you for your patience and understanding!"}< /resp><gmapID>0x8082d9a6f1e36f11:0x8e88f2f532b001a9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have had their service for a number of years and am mostly happy with the service. The thing that bothers me is when it went from unlimited to limited data usage years ago. I pay more now for the service than I did in the past and I only have 150gb between 3 people in the house. I often do work from home but would sooner drive the 25 min to town to use someone else’s WiFi so I don’t have to worry about going over my limit and experiencing slower speeds than I already do; I don’t always get the best/advertised speeds.  I’ve had good customer support from them over the years and I am fortunate to have the hardware mounted to my house with a clear view, as I understand it gets more expensive to mount to trees, etc. They’re the best option where I live but there may be fiber optics or some cable option in the future that I will most likely switch to.< /text>

<Review>Worst internet service I have ever had to deal with. Constantly down, rebooting, etc. Latency times are horrendous. I've spoken to their customer support multiple times and he said channel is bleeding through to other providers on the same tower. Just to give you an idea, my latency is over 10,000ms at times, that is 5 times worse than Satellite. During high use hours it's nearly impossible to do anything as speeds drop to less than .1MB. Service is down now as I am writing this and it has been down for several hours. When power goes out, they have no backup generators or anything to provide any sort of service so they blame it on PG&E. I also have not seen any adjustments in our bill due to the service being down for several days this past month.

Update, noon 11/6/2019, internet is down again just in case you haven't noticed.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Two DigitalPath technicians/installers (Matthew and Brett -hope I have the names right) came out on the morning of April 1 in response to an on-going lack of internet connection.  They arrived on-time, within the schedule window, and got directly to work checking out the line and diagnosing the problem.  Turned out the antenna, located about 80 feet up a tree, was infested with ants and had to be replaced (a difficult task).   Following replacement of the antenna, Matthew and Brett verified the performance of all elements of the system.   The work was accomplished  quickly and competently.  They kept us informed about what they were doing and why and were easy to engage.   Matthew was one of the original installers of the system in May 2017.   The system is now working better than ever.  Couldn't have asked for, or expected, better support.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Most of the time, this service won't even open a search browser! Speed test is a joke! 0.22 mbps to 9.5 mbps in a 30 second span. All day all night  just bouncing around with no consistency. I can see the tower with the naked eye so frustrating. Something is loose FIX IT PLEASE. You just installed a sight to sight here above Smartsville so you know who I am. All tests were done from the house, so it is not the sight to sight. If i could get a consistent  half of what you advertise I could live with that!<//text>

<Review>Sure it isn't as fast or reliable as cable, and sure, it breaks down from time to time, but generally it works very well for me here in the woods. In fact it's the ONLY service that has ever allowed me to reliably work from home, stream movies and generally operate as if I DID have cable. When there are problems, the service people are very helpful and knowledgeable.<//Review>< date>

< review>
Using for over 4 years and still inconsistent! Sometimes speeds are good and other times absolutely horrible. It seems about every year Digital Path is upgrading equipment or dealing with some kind of power outage. Realistically they are probably overselling their available bandwidth and as a result customers including myself have slow speeds (evening & weekends) and at times no connection. In the years I've been with Digital Path I've called over 40 times. If I could move to another provider, I would, but nothing as of yet in my small town. That may change next year, but I'll have to wait and see. Let's be clear this company could go three stars or more- but their advertised speeds are just not correct (most of the time they trickle to a crawl) and over the years no one is able to clearly explain what is really going on. Honesty would go much further then excuses for their wish washy answers. Note- I've talked with a few of their installers over the years and they've basically said the same thing - if you can get DSL or something else go for it Are they better than Frontier- in my opinion yes. Is the service better than dial-up; yes. Is it better than satellite, well that depends on your location.<//review>

About 18 months ago, Digital Path told me they were going to double my rates from $50 to over $100.  They gave me some lame reason for the increase - but they raised my rates because I had no alternative.  I was stuck with DP and they knew it. They also added minor increases in my rates over that year and a half timeframe.  In my area, a fixed wireless internet competitor came in and offered me significantly better speed at 1/2 the cost.  I dropped Digital Path because an option became available.  As other alternatives come into play for rural internet, Digital Path will be losing customers due to lower speeds at a higher cost.  I was with DP for 6 years - but when another option became availble - I was happy to leave.</text>

Connection problems daily. Paying for 50 Mb service often getting less than 10. Just not a reliable source of internet.
Customer tech support is good when they are there. Only open 8 to5.

Nice that they replied and were going to have someone contact me, but it has been 2 weeks and no one has called. this just validates my point, customers do not seem to matter.<//text>

<text>I've had Digital Path for 3 years, and just when I was about to drop it about 2 years ago,  it got super fast and totally reliable.  I live in a fairly remote area and evidently have great sight lines to their antenna...and they have upgraded the service over time.  If you aren't happy, organize other users in your neighborhood...the company tries to be responsive and will get to you sooner, so I was told.< /text>< Pictures>

My internet stopped working and crippled my business. The fastest they could get to fixing the problem was 5 business days. They said i was lucky because the typical time was repair time longer than that.
I asked to speak to the supervisor or general Manager and was told they do not talk with customers.
I want you all to know I am the type of person who hardly ever complains. Being a business owner I always try to understand the challenges of customer service and field repairs.
I wrote an e-mail to their company and never got a response. I live in the foot hills and they are the only provider other than dial up,so I believe this is why they could careless about the customer. They are the only game in town. I would normally never say this,but if you can do not consider Digital Path for any reason.
My story is not unique I have heard the same types of things from many people now that I have asked them.
I was told not to post this because Digital Path will make sure my system is down often,but I feel it is ethically something I should do for those of you that have a choice in what provider you can choose.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I got digital path a few years ago and it was great. 50 a month unlimited. Then a year or so ago they started limiting it then I upgraded to 85 per month. The service is terrible now I think too many people are on the same server. The internet works a couple of days a week and not mot than a few hrs before getting disconnected.< /Text>

They don't  even deserve 1 star. When I moved out here initially they didn't offer any caps on their data and that seemed like a no-brainer however since then they put serious limits on them their data their service has gotten slower and slower and probably worst of all it cuts out constantly and I have a direct view of the Tower. The mobile data on my cell phone is faster and more reliable and I don't even have voice calling on my cell phone from my home but my data works better than theirs</Text>

< Review>
*EDIT*
They recently upgraded to the new generation of equipment. My speed and data cap increased substantially and the price went down too. I am changing my rating to 5 stars.

Overall:
Best Internet available for my needs at this time, however I will switch to cable the second it is available(which may never happen).

Reliability:
Very reliable service, i have only had a handful of outages in 2+ years, much more reliable than Comcast in the Sacramento area.

Speed:
Highest available to me in rural cottonwood without switching to high-latency Satellite service. 10Mbps/2Mbps. Faster speeds available in town.

Bandwith:
Huge data caps (500GB) available.

Price:
$130.95 for this tier(10Mbps w/400gb cap). Outrageously high compared to cable providers where they are available.< /Review>

Yes they offer free installation & the guy that did mine was great but after you become a customer , forget it. I pay my bill and get decent service for about 13 days in a month, after that a spinning loading circle is all i get. There is NO Way were using 150 GB of data in 13 days. Next month im canceling my service and getting a verizon hotspot. They have an unlimited prepaid plan for $80 a month. Thank God I didnt have to sign a contract with these people.</text>

< Review>
We’ve had this service for about 7 years now. It has been better and worse. For the past year or so very much worse. We are in the Calistoga area and we are served from antennas on Mt St Helena. Our service is frequently unavailable entirely or very slow. We are told it is because of “cross talk” from other users there, whether cell phone towers, aircraft whatever. It takes a 20-30 minute call to tech support for them to reprogram the channel and improve the service. This can happen several times per day.

We have been told that this is a severe problem in our area that can’t be fixed. One tech told us we should get another service provider. Of course there aren’t many here other than satellite

Digital Path should not even offer service in an area where it cannot provide it consistently. By doing so it is committing fraud on its customers.  Do not use this company in the Calistoga area. It is worse than nothing.<//Review>

Was recently informed by Digital Path that unless I upgraded from the $65 a month plan to $100+ a month that my internet connection would be throttled down.
I told the representative that I didn't go for extortion and to leave my plan alone.
Digital path made good on their threat and throttled down my bandwidth to...useless.
I wish there was an alternative and I will switch as soon as I find one.<//Text>

Do Not Waste time with them. Never get half the speed. They pulled my equipment and cancelled contract because they moved their antenna when they were suppose to just come and readjust dish. I was suppose to get refund for month but had to call 2x and both said it will take 3-5 days. Switching to Unwired Broadband now and just service alone made me want to switch.<//Review>

I’d give these guys zero stars if I could. We're supposed to get 10 down and 2 up but that rarely happens. It seems like I have to call these guys atleast once a week because I’m getting 2 down and almost nothing up. The WiFi always goes out when it starts raining or getting windy. They always give excuses like “there’s too many clouds” (that was on a clear day in June) or “your house is too old” (um, what? This house was build sometime after 2005, that’s hardly old). Oh and did a I mention that you randomly get ping spikes up to 1,000 and jitter of 2,000 or more? The WiFi regularly stops working for a minute or two and then starts working again (this happens multiple times a day). They also raised their monthly price (in the middle of a payment cycle) by $3 to “support increased video traffic”.
Where I used to live in Washington, rain, snow, hail, wind or thunderstorm, the WiFi would stay on, or on the rare times it did go out, the owner of the company would be out to my house to fix the problem within a hour or two.
Digital path, get your act together.<//review>

Consistent, reliable and mostly customer friendly.  Speeds are good, even in remote locations, price is reasonable and this isn't one of the mega-corporations that's going to try to sell you five other things and then use your hard earned cash to fund Koch Industries' candidates in national elections.<//Review>

<Review>This company should be out of business. We have been customers for over two years and unfortunately there are no other options where we live. My wife relies on the internet to conduct her business (she is self employed) and is constantly experiencing interruptions. Since we have been customers, we have probably called customer service and tech support well over 100 times. Technicians have come out to our house and re-aimed the dish, made adjustments to our equipment, and the service will improve for about an hour and then return back to multiple interruptions. The wait times to talk to tech support are never less than 30 minutes and they are not 24 hour. It seems that when we experience the most interruptions in service is when tech support is closed. Interestingly enough, when we do get a tech support rep, we are often told that there is a high demand on the bandwidth and that is why so many interruptions, yet they keep advertising to gain new and more customers. Judging by the majority of reviews posted here, we are not alone (apparently we are one of those whiny crybabies referred to by another poster).

I will say that the customer service reps have been pleasant to deal with, but the tech support reps are absolutely horrible. No help at all. If you are a customer in search of an internet service provider, my recommendation is to keep searching. You will be disappointed with Digital Path.<//Review>< time>

I've called and written them many times but they just don't care. They know they are my only option and can't care less. They should care, because when someone else offers a service in my area, they are going to loose all the business of all these 1 star reviewers.<//Text>

I wish I could give less than 1 star. This is the worst customer services I've ever had. We finally got a new provider and I cancelled my services as quickly as possible. While cancelling, customer service lied to me about my billing cycle dates before finally agreeing to refund the autopay. Instead of giving me the refund as they said they would, they charged my credit card a second time then refunded that payment. This is a very deceptive and underhanded company.<//Review>

I have had Digital Path for over two years and I love it. I get what I pay for and they are very helpful it I have to call with any problems. I have only had my Internet go down for over a day two times in the last two years. It fluctuates every once in a while but that happens with all of them.</Text>

Our internet is down on most days, calls in never resolve it and we're never given answers as to why our internet is so bad. Digitalpath has to be one of the worst internet providers around, I'm sure the only reason other continue to use them is due to lack of options (that's why we are stuck with them). Regardless of how many negative reviews they have, it certainly doesn't seem to make them strive to provide better internet service or customer service for that matter.<//review>

Worst internet service I have ever experienced.  I swear dial up is faster.  Digital Path has poor customer service and blamed our equipment for the poor connection and quality.  That being said I took our equipment to my families house and it worked great.  After bringing this information to their attention they still blamed our equipment.  Please!  Don't waste your time, keep your sanity.</text>

Worst company out there. Had to stay with them for years because we live out in a rural area and no other company offered service out here. They basically told us we were throwing our money away because we would never get the speeds that we were paying for. They are out to make money they don't care about their customers. The data cap that they implemented is ridiculous. If I could give them negative stars I would. Thankfully another company is available out here now.<//text>

This is the worst service I have ever had.  At least with dial up I could get online, it was slower 1/2 the time but I could check my e-mail all the time.  I am tired of being on hold were they do not answer their phones.  I don't no how they stay in business.  I would give them a zero but I was not given that option.< /Text>

It's available, it's faster than satellite, and it generally works well. Sure digital path goes down from time to time, but they generally have the internet back up in a few hours if there's an outage and troubleshoot your specific connection if you aren't in the outage area.< /Review>

<text>Potentially the worst service we've ever had.  Our business has been dealing with issues for months without resolution.  Our office manager called in to get service and was told it was on our end, and then promptly hung up on.  The only other connection available is AT&T 3Mb/s and we are seriously contemplating going back, despite the lack of speed.  Call, wait 45 minutes on hold, They try a fix, ask us to call back if we have issues, then 5 minutes later the issues are back, repeat endlessly.....</text>< pictures>

Am trying desperately to find another provider in our area. Digital Path represents service they do not deliver. Terrible. Don't be fooled by tech support saying they will solve your connection speed problems. They oversell their network so there is no way they can deliver promised speeds if  all customers are using their service. Pretty obvious once you think about it. Good profit model poor customer model<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><text>The deal is, they oversold their bandwidth. Everything comes from the one tower in Chico, and they have too many customers to serve, by a lot. Save yourself some heartache and go with something else... ANYTHING else. If you live rurally, I suggest looking at Verizon air cards. I have friends that swear by it and that's what we'll be looking into next.

Some history...
We've been a customer for some time because we live rurally and pretty much have no other option. 6 or 7 years ago, it was amazing; my bf could play Left 4 Dead while I streamed Netflix. A beautiful thing. Now, we can't do either of those things independently, let alone at the same time.

We've had the hardware checked and replaced over the years, just for good measure, and always at their suggestion because no one could ever tell us what the problem was. Internet drops every few seconds; we have VoIP,  of course, but can't make any calls because the service is that spotty. We have to walk to an open spot on the mountain and use cell phones for phone calls. Tried higher package, because we don't have other options. We've been paying $30 more for 6 months, but service is worse than ever.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Our internet quit working and after tech support tried everything  they could to help, they had me schedule an appointment for a tree climber and technician to come.  This was the Friday before Christmas, with company coming.  I was scheduled for the Tuesday after Christmas.  I got a call about an hour later and was told there was a crew on the way!  They came, in the pouring rain and wind, climbed the tree, put up an upgraded dish, ran new line, and got us up and running.  They were out in the rain and wind for about 4 hours.  The climber was in the tree for a very long time.  They were extremely nice, courteous, helpful, tidy, and thorough.  And my dogs liked them.  Now we are good to go for our family for Christmas........as long as the power stays on!

My connection is down every week.  I'm paying for 10mbs,, I'm lucky to get 2mbs.  You can only get support during "business hours" after a long time on hold.  It seems like the connection goes down at night when my son is trying to turn in his homework.  I'm live in a rural area so I don't have many options.  I WISH I DID<//text>

Absolutely awful. Never get my 6mps unless I complain every 6 weeks. Interesting how they can get you your bandwidth on an instance when you complain and slowly dial you down until you complain. What a crock!!! To make matters worse. I can damn near throw a rock at the tower. That's how close we are.< /review>

WORST I.S.P. EVER!!! Net CONSTANTLY up and down throughout the night, EVERY NIGHT!! Sometimes during the day also. Sometimes no net at all for days at a time. Miraculously, it comes back on and works for a few hours after a call to customer service, but once office open hours are over, it's back to the same old song and dance. And the evening time down-hours are VERY RAPIDLY getting earlier and earlier. Just a few days ago, it would start happening at about 10:30pm, now it's BEFORE 8:30pm. Am going to just pay more for cell phone service, and use mobile hotspot, and I'll be taking as many friends with me as possible. This is ridiculous. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COMPANY IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER OPTION(S)!!!!< /Text>

<Review>We have had extremely poor service with this company.  We have had multiple conversations with customer support and each time we get the same story...the network is overloaded and they are working on upgrades.  However they can't tell us when or where the upgrades will take place.

This company has been advertising heavily for new customers.  I asked today why they would do that when they have already admitted that their system is overloaded?

I think what they are doing is bordering on fraud!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>I have had good luck with Digital Path. They do drop out a lot, which means VOIP calling is tough. However the internet is not bad. 6 mgs down, .5 mgs up.

The techs are always helpful. My recommendation to all those not liking tech support; remember the techs are good with technical stuff... not people. They spend all day dealing with problems and most of us don't understand the technical terms they are using.<//Text>< Rating>

The amount of expletives that I would like to apply towards this company would surely get my review removed. The service is terrible. They are the only provider in my area and they know it. I was dumb enough to pay for a year in advance, well the voip service is literally unusable and the we are lucky to get a 1/5 of the speed we pay for. I have to call once a week to get them to "fix" the internet so that I can check my email. It's atrocious and as soon as a competitor comes on line later this year I will be the first to sign up!</Review>

Well, there is one more option, but it's not as easy. If you live somewhere where digital path is your only ISP option, your mobile phone service is probably also weak. However, with the additional of a signal booster, and some work arounds, it's possible to get faster speeds for a cheaper price from a dedicated mobile phone used as a hotspot. The fact that it's possible to have faster speeds for cheaper from a dedicated mobile hotspot should tell you everything you need to know about how bad digital path is.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Paul Axyz</name><response>None<//response><user_id>114975112514190994297<//user_id><gmapID>0x8082d9a6f1e36f11:0x8e88f2f532b001a9</gmapID><rating>1<//rating></record>

Sometimes the service works, sometimes it doesn't. Total crapshoot everyday. AND, you cannot pay your bill online. That's right. An internet service company that doesn't know enough about the internet to provide online bill pay. You are better off with dial-up.<//Text>

A truly terrible service provider.
These guys could provide cotton candy to kids at a Justin Beiber concert and still be a huge disappointment. Their customer service will give you attitude, tech support is strained.
I cancelled my service with them, took the cut to my checkbook. It was worth not having to deal with them anymore... but guess what, that huge antenna? It's STILL on my roof after numerous calls to try and get someone out to un install it.
Anyone want a 50ft dish tower?<//text>

Absolutely horrible internet service!!! I was on hold with tech support and the 6th caller. I sat on hold for 30 minutes and when the recording finally announced that I was the next person they played a recording that said they were closed. Ridiculous hours for a ISP!!! It's almost as if they don't want your business and have the attitude that they can get by just fine without your business. Unbelievable!!!!<//text>

We called them out to see if we could get service n they came out n climbed the tree n told us that we could'nt get it. So are the neighbor called and they came out and told them if they have me cut a top of one of my trees off he could get service . We had a tree guy come out and they cut the tree and my neighbor came and told me they got their service and to call and set an appointment for our service.We called them and they told us that we would have to pay 25.00 a month extra for a good neighbor plan and they would still have to pay for a tree guy to come out again and be charged for a dish on our house and we were miss led by the service tec. from digital path that there would be no fee for the good nieghbor plan and that it would be like a snap to do and take a day to install. So after one hr.  of trying to express what we had done for their new customer's they had nothing to say or help us with anything. Great customer Service digital path. I will be sure to pass the word around town .<//Text>

Paying over $100 a month for "business class" internet. I'm currently getting 27KBp/s down and my upload has so much packet loss everything errors. This is the worst it's ever been but it's usually below 250KBp/s when I'm paying for 6Mbp/s.

Their customer service is terrible. Whenever I call them it's "We're working on it." or "We're aware of a problem affecting some of our customers." and yet it never gets fixed. It's kind of just a 'Screw you stop calling us.' Rather than being helpful. It's been well over a year and their quality has steadily been going down hill. The odd thing is though, is that when you sign up for the first few months everything works perfectly, but after that good luck checking your emails.

If you have ANY other options explore them first. For me this is my only option unfortunately. Steer clear.</Text>

Really terrible internet provider. They seem to capitalize on the fact that, for many, they are the only rural north-state option, and, as such, they don't care AT ALL about quality of service. The connection constantly cuts in and out, is BRUTALLY slow most of the time, and constantly resets connections. Also, who doesn't do unlimited plans in 2017? BOOOOO for DigitalPath...</Text>

You will never be able to enjoy your evening watching Netflix or other internet television services with this internet service. After 6:00 PM the connection is slow, it is IMPOSSIBLE to watch a show or movie with "normal" buffering, no, you are waiting 15 minutes for 2 minutes of show to load. Other times the connection just stops and freezes. Been waiting for a year for the connection to be upgraded and still nothing. The most unreliable internet connection I've ever experienced!< /text>

Doesn't deserve one star. The worst "service" one could ever be sucked into. It's slower than dial up when it does "work." Disconnects every 10 minutes and is very frustrating. Customer service will tell you lie after lie. DON'T DO IT!</text>

Every month calling multiple times to fix connection... they do fix it temporarily but like clock work they seem to turn down my internet back within a day or 2.  Speed is some times fast for a moment, but then cuts out and you loose what ever information was almost loading.
Frustration, anger, stress and disappointment   is how I feel using this Internet provider.
Im talking simple websites that would load faster with dial up end up timing out or freezing with the loading circle.
My 2 year old son can barely talk but he now makes a circle motion with his index finger and says "loading"  with a sigh of frustration.
Would NOT recomend this provider to anyone ever, unless you like giving your money away to a company that can not deliver results promised.< /text>

Unfortunately the service can never be counted on, one minute it will work fine and the next will be completely out or incredibly slow. I have had pleasant experiences with the tech support reps but had mixed results with the customer service reps. The hold times range anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes. If they end up needing to send a technician to your residence to fix anything, expect a 1 to 2 week waiting period. I really wish the service was better because they are really the only internet service provider in Plumas County at the moment that is taking new customers. Additionally, I have used the customer support form on the DigitalPath website to email them about questions or problems I'm having and have not once received a response back. Its pretty hilarious they are located on a street called Marauder St!< /review>< pics>

Really wish I could say something nice but I have an advertised "up to 6mpbs plan" Because it's the only thing they offer here. But really only get about 500KB/s most of the time even with no one else in the house using the internet. Horrible service near Table mountain. Been this way since I got it 4 years ago. Funny thing is I'd switch to a different service in a heartbeat but Digital path seems to be the only ones who provide service out here.
No competitors means they can just do this to us.
I've complained multiple times and even had technicians come out from them, only to discover they couldn't get it up to the speed they're supposedly selling me. How? I have no idea.
The only reason this company is around is because they don't have competitors in remote locations. I have friends in Concow that get around 14mbps with the same company and they're in much more remote locations then where I'm at. Pathetic. Up your game Digital Path..</text>

WORST INTERNET PROVIDER! We have a professional plan which is a joke. Most often the internet does not work; sent emails FAIL; search options SPIN and do not upload; on-line banking and bill pay becomes dubious because it is unclear if transactions have gone through since internet service is intermittent and will often fail in mid-transaction. Technical Support at Digital Path always has an excuse never a solution!</review>

<username>Todd guy</username><Text>The first 5-7 months were great we were able to get decent speeds most of the time however things have been going downhill since then.
around 7pm till we go to bed the DL speeds have dipped below 1Mbps and you cant stay connected. I have tried to call a few times but nothing gets resolved. They simply have to many people and not enough Bandwidth now.
Look elsewhere, it's just to expensive for what you get.

****update
I received a call out of the blue last week and was told
They were making changes to the service and that I had to pay $20.00 more or deal with 100gb data limit.
So a day or two later I get my bill and they say they are raising rates for the third time in a little over 1 year and a half..
I called them and cancelled, I'd rather go without.

Worst ISP i have seen to date. They have recently introduced a 100gb data cap to everyone and set it so that everypne gets the same speeds. But since i have a horrible internet connection to sart with, their promise of "increased speeds" is basicly me getting the same 500kb/s that ive been recieving. The only reason i dont leave is because i live too far out of town and need internet connection for school. This company is cheap and they take advantage of everyone they possibly can, do not request this internet servixe without knowing 100% that there are no other options.< /text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. We specifically signed up with Digitalpath to videoconference for work. The speed was just barely fast enough, sometimes it was a bit pixelated, but tolerable considering our other options where we live. However, after a couple of months, the speed grew slower and slower. I could not videoconference, I couldn't even access email half the time! It was worse than our old dial up. Many phone calls to the tech department with adjustments on their end, multiple technician trips to the house, being required to buy more of their expensive equipment, and finally we got an honest tech that told us Digitalpath has oversold the area. The tower has far more subscribers than capacity.  No amount of technical tweaking or expensive upgrading on our part was ever going to work!! We called to cancel, but their customer NOservice was unprofessional and rude.  The only reply after being transferred several times was "You are in a contract" Nice job Digitalpath.<//review>

< Review>
how can a company pride itself in its work with so many negative reviews? they must really not care.... i have been with digital path for 3 years now and at first it was great ( i went a year without internet so anything was better than nothing) but it slowly started getting worse and worse. theres times when i go a week without internet but yet its never their fault and im stuck paying full price (way overpriced to top it off).

just last month i got a call stating that they were going to enforce the datacap and that i had exceeded, i got the call 4-14-16 and was limited down to .50mb download and .50mb upload and it is now 5-13-16 and im still stuck at this hardly useable speed. i wouldnt be so pissed off if they actually throttled me during peak hours, i hardly believe a month is peak hours though. i highly suggest everyone who is upset with digitalpath file a complaint with the FCC online, maybe if enough of us light a fire under their ass they will change their business practices.< /Review>

Horrible. Just absolutely horrible. When I first got it about 2 years ago, the service was consistently pretty good for about a month (low ping, good download and upload speeds). Nowadays, I'm paying $75/month for an advertised 6 Mb/s download and 1 Mb/s upload. The only problem is that I really get around 0.05 Mb/s download and 0.01 Mb/s upload. It's been that way for months. It doesn't matter if you call them, since after waiting for 45 minutes to talk to a technician they literally just turn your service off and back on again. It rarely solves anything. It's incredibly inconsistent and unreliable and whenever you click on a link or try to do anything that requires the internet, you have to cross your fingers and pray that this horrendous internet service will pull through. The one and only reason you should ever get this trash is if you have two other options: dial-up and satellite. If you think you're going to escape from "slow" at&t or "evil" Comcast, think again. I've personally experienced Comcast and at&t, so believe me when I say that they are both far, far, far, far better options than Digital Trash.</review>

For the first year service was awesome...but now it's straight garbage! I call in at least 5-6 times a week cause it's constantly down sometimes spending over an hr on hold...they are having way to many issues with the relay my antenna is pointed at..I'm extremely unsatisfied with this service but isn't any other services out here...there have been some months without any Internet or house phone for like a week but yet I still have to pay for service I ain't getting..their excuses are there's too many ppl using the same frequencies that some how nesses up the damn relay an it takes them for ever to fricken fix!! What really pisses me off is it goes out every damn weekend an especially when they are closed!! They need a 24 hr technician to be there or on call to fix the damn problems cause it's beyond bs!!!! Wish their Internet service was as good as their customer service cause those ppl are always great!!< /text>

We've had digital path for a few years now.  We live in the country so believe it or not they were an improvement from the DSL we had.  We experienced the slow down like the others have noted.  The reason I'm writing this is due to their inexcusable lack of customer service.  Our internet went out February 8th.  When we called them they told us it was an equipment issue and the soonest they would come out was the 18th.  I called them to tell them that was not acceptable since our daughter is in an on-line program of study and this would put her behind.  Well, no return call, no acknowledgement of my contacting them.  You want to bet they want their full month of service fee?  I am hopeful that there are more providers into our area so we can get a better product for our money.<//Review>

CRAP....ABSOLUTE CRAP. We've had DigitalPath for over two years and have had nothing but problems with connection speeds. Sometimes it's actually so bad we get less than 56K, and when it is "fast"..haha...it's inconsistant speeds, just up and down. This is very frustrating because we are paying $77 now for BAD internet. Tech support is worthless amd gives all sorts of interesting excuses and I quote "there isn't like a magic button I can push to make your speeds go up"......SERIOUSLY Tech "Support"!!!??? Another favorite when asked why there is always on average 7-15 callers in the waiting list for Tech Support is that and I quote..."OLD PEOPLE clogg up the Tech Support lines and they take a long time to understand us"......BECAUSE....OLD PEOPLE. Really, Tech Support!!?? I wonder what the excuse will be next!!?? I have to admit it's getting quite entertaining.< /Review>

<review>I've been a digital path customer for about 4 years now. Unfortunately every year they just seemed to get worse and worse. Times when you're connection does work, generally you get about 1/3'rd the connection you pay for. And if you're connection does fail (which innevitably it will) The customer support lines are more crammed than at&t sometimes you can't even get your call answered before they close. That and the fact that they only blame the customer if connection fails and try to get you to "upgrade" to a more expensive plan instead of actually fixing you're issue. Lastly there cost is huge compared to most isp's being around 80 to 120 dollars for both phone and internet at speeds "up to" 25mbs.. Which is rediculous concidering many other companies max out at around 30 to 100 dollars. So my suggestion is that if you have other options in your area, I would suggest you try them first. Thanks for reading!</review></record>

Most of the time our internet will hardly work and if we call them they claim that they did a test and it is all on our end.  But other users have been reporting problems such as these.

They say you will get download speeds in the megabytes but I have never gotten over 700kbs.  Also it is stated in the contract (and I'm paraphrasing) that the consumer will be marked as a "heavy user", and they will slow down your internet speeds during "peak" hours if you use your internet for more than checking your emails.  It is also stated that if you use more than your plan amount per month (Which are pathetic amounts like 100GB) your internet will be slowed down even further.

Such a poor excuse for an internet provider.<//review><Resp>None</Resp></record>

The worst company I've dealt with in my life. The internet is down every week (been with them over a year). Constantly excuses. You will wait on hold for at least 15 min minimum every time you call. It also takes them at least 5 days to come out to your house - even if it breaks the day after they've "fixed" it. And here's the kicker, your internet can be down more days than it's up in a billing period, and they charge you for a full month. These people are a joke. Satellite is soooo much more reliable.</Text>

If I could discribe digital path In one word the word would be "inconsistent"

There coustomer service is as bad as it gets. The rep will of course not know the answer to your question. So they claim they will call you back. In all reality they will never call you back.  Now onto the actual service. It is terrible. I personally never get the 6 Mbps upload and 1 Mbps download I am paying for. If you call and ask they say "we are sorry but we have gained a lot of customers and are having trouble keeping up with the demand." If digital path is the only option of Internet in the area you live and you want consistantly fast internet. You will have to move to where another company can actually provide the service you pay for.</Review>

Extremely inconsistent.  They blamed it on my router so I bought an AirPort Extreme - same issue.  Bumped up my mobile data plan and create a hotspot when DigitalPath isn't working.  Frustrating, but no other options where I live.  Would change providers if I had the opportunity.< /review>

<Text>God I hate Digital Path.  I pay for 6Mbps but feel incredibly lucky to get 4.   Most of the time I get 2 or 2.5. Since July of 2015 I've had the technicians to my house three times to fix problems that can't be solved over the phone and each time the wait to have a tech come out is over a week. I have to call tech support to solve packet loss problems about every other week and the wait time is never less than 45 minutes. If I had any other options at all I'd go with it.  Unfortunately where I live, and it's the same story with the majority of their customers, it's Digital Path or nothing and they know it. They have no incentive to improve service, speed, or reliability because they have absolutely no competition in most areas. They did recently raise rates and impose a 100GB data cap though. So now I have slow speeds, terrible reliability, high rates, a data cap, and absolutely nothing I can do about it.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
The service was canceled less than 7 days after the installation because of poor signal and very slow un-reliable connections..
Then the customer service department was notified that the equipment was to be removed.. The customer service people advised they would remove the equipment right away?? Now 6 or 8 months later the equipment is not yet removed and the roof has begun to leek water into the attic of the house and bathroom due to the holes drilled to install the equipment originally..
I have contacted customer service to see if the equipment can now be removed and the roof repaired before the damage becomes more costly and requires additional cost to repair??
I was put on hold,first thing,told the person that handles these issues is out of his office and to leave a message on his voicemail?? Mean while the roof continues to leek...
Not only does there service not work well,but now I have a leaking roof as a result of there installation...< /Review>

Lots of space between fuel dispensers,a store that stocks all the typical items you find at a gas station and more. They also have Thrifty ice cream and delicious deep fried chicken. Staff is friendly and the store is super clean.</Text>

They were all so nice, even the lady who helped me was nice. It just made my day! It really does make a difference in someone's day.< /review>< Response>

<review>Post office is horrible if you want your package to get lost use USPS their is no way to call the local post office either, Person delivering normal mail is also no help, online you make a claim you'll get an email from someone but never get any updates. They have the worst system ever. Defund this place this is the 3rd time this has happened. They should attend training sessions at UPS or FEDEX or even AMAZON delivery, everyone is so much better, I understand things happen but at least provide support that's what really gets me specially when you pay for the faster shipping.</review><resp>None< /resp></record>

<text>I've been coming to this post office to drop off packages for my Ebay business for about 3 months and I've never had one issue here! All the personal are friendly and quite knowledgeable. For example I also used to wait in line to drop off packages, but after learning about using the self service kiosk from one of the employees I can just scan my packages through the machine then you can drop off the mail through the little mail choot contraption lol and avoid the lines (:</text><response>None</response><user_name>Juan J</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I like this post office and it’s right up the street from my house. But every time I have multiple boxes to ship for work, 10 at the most, I get pressured by the workers to leave them in the back. Where they have a huge sign that says they’re not responsible for stolen items and there’s no one ever back there protecting dropped off packages. So I’m taking my business to another location, I’m tired of getting dirty looks from the employees for dropping off more than 3 boxes at a time for work :(< /Text>< Pictures>

I have a PO Box at this branch and this is the best staff at any local post office here believe me. I’ve been to all of them and this is the best and fastest moving post office there is locally. If it’s ever moving slow it’s the clients fault for not being prepared when they get to the counter. Highly recommended !<//Review>

<Text>Fantastic Post Office and great parking!
All the clerks are very nice and the employees on the shipping / receiving dock are always very helpful with which bins my outgoing prepaid packages should go into.

I have never had a problem at this location I don’t understand all the bad reviews left by these disgruntled customers.
They must have never learned how to do things properly or for themselves, or maybe most of the negative reviews are from lazy millennials that need everything done for them and can’t take the criticism that they did something incorrectly.

Eitherway, this USPS location is always fantastic!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>I've had very good experiences here. There are 2 self service machines in the lobby, and 2 more self service machines Inside. I needed to mail something to Norway, which meant a trip to the counter. There was quite a line. To my surprise, more counter help arrived. There were 6 people helping us. Very happy.< /text>< gmap_id>

Unbearably slow and endless lines at nearly every time I've ever gone. The staff are friendly, but there simply aren't enough of them to handle demand, even for simple tasks.<//Review>

I have never seen employees at the Post Office hustle like they do here.  They have trained me on how to use the kiosk, so I can get in and out even quicker.  I appreciate everyone here and all that they do to expedite me through the line.  Plus they are always smiling and willing to help me.  Thank you for everything you do!!</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>The USPS is not paid for by tax dollars any more. Getting your mail is a privilege not a right. The USPS is a company run by human beings, human beings make mistakes, no one is perfect. The vast majority of USPS employees want your experience to be positive, carriers are not intentionally trying to damage or slow down your mail. Postal carriers are breaking their backs in the heat, cold and rain hauling your heavy packages up and down stairs and hills every single day. USPS carriers work Saturdays and Sundays to make sure your packages are delivered in a timely manner. Carriers frequently walk 5 to 15 miles a day. Mail carriers put their lives on the line every day to make sure you get your mail delivered. A simple "thank you" can go a long way sometimes. Blowing up on an online forum or review site because you didn't get one  package delivered on time is completely unfair and inconsiderate of the massive amount of work that the USPS does every single day for their millions of customers.

The vast majority of complaints I am seeing on here may be caused by errors on the customers side.

#1 Make sure the address is 100% accurate. If you don't include the apartment number, suite number or complete and accurate address (North, South, East, West, etc.) it will probably be held at the office for a few days while the carriers try to locate the correct address or sent back to sender if they are not able to locate you. Sometimes packages end up on the wrong route and will be delayed. The USPS does not guarantee delivery time on any of their mail except Express mail. If you are sending something that absolutely must be there at a certain time send it Express mail.

#2 Check your mailboxes regularly. Your mail will be held at the post office for a few days and then sent back to the sender if your mailbox is full. Mail carriers cut their hands, jam their fingers and sprain wrists trying to put mail in mailboxes that have not been checked properly by the customer.

#3 If you move or go on vacation talk to your mail person, go online or go to the office and let the USPS know. Your mail may be held at the post office for a few days and sent back to sender if you do not let the USPS know ahead of time.

#4 If you order an extremely over sized package do not be surprised if you have to go pick it up yourself at the post office. The mail carriers vehicles are the size of a small pickup truck bed. Large packages can take up to 40% of the truck space and keep the carrier from loading the rest of their days mail safely and securely.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c295153a67f589:0x8c662e64f1baf35e</gmap_id>< rating>

<review>This post office is sketchy, I can recall numerous time my mail has been tampered with, either a slit small enough to look in or just plan open. I got a letter today and low and behold, it was in my box magically open with the coupons resting on the letter as if someone took it upon themselves to take a peek at them. Make sure to keep track of your letters and report any suspicious activity.<//review><Name>Arnold C</Name></record>

Completely useless staff, no information ever given to you, uncaring staff with no answers to the most basic questions. As an added bonus they talk back to you in the most rude way they can! If you never want your mail recieved or delivered, I highly suggest this place, as they are the best at not doing their one job!< /review>

I loathe having to deal with this place. USPS is the absolute worst. I would prefer all my packages be delivered via UPS or FedEx but unfortunately sometimes I get a package through USPS and it is always HELL.

They absolutely NEVER leave my package at my door, nor do they make ANY attempt to actually deliver anything. There have been countless times where I'm home waiting for a package and then a few hours go by, I check my mailbox to find the infamous "peach slip" stating that they "attempted to deliver" my package... Even though I have perfectly working ears and a perfectly good doorbell, they make NO ATTEMPT to deliver my package. Instead the package doesn't even leave the facility. It sits there and they just fill out a bunch of peach slips to drop off in mailboxes because the workers are TOO DAMN LAZY to bother actually carrying boxes around.

It's no wonder the USPS is struggling to stay in business. It's the worst service I've ever seen... and since when do you have to pay extra just to make sure your package doesn't get damaged? What the hell? Isn't that the entire point of their service? To deliver your mail? Why do we literally have our packages held for ransom?<//Text>

Anytime I have tried to call this post office it is constantly busy.  It seems no one here answers the phone.  The phone is in a constant busy signal which is not logically possible so one can only conclude they purposefully do not answer it.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Not professional nor should this be tolerated as it is poor business practice.  The management and/or employees who participate in this practice should be reprimanded  for incompetence.  Very disgraceful.  I would use a different post office or UPS/FED EX first for my postal/shipping needs.<//Text>

If you happen to miss your package and receive a peach slip don't even bother trying to reschedule a delivery. For the past couple of months every time I scheduled a redelivery the package straight up didn't show up and they made no attempt to get it to me. The only way to get your package is to take time out of your day to go on down to the post office and pick it up.< /Text>

Expecting a very important package for my daughter. The postman did not leave the package  even though there is someone to receive it. Tried to pick it up at their facility, unfortunately it's not available until the postman comes back later the day/night. Now, my daughter have to wait one more day to receive the gift from her mom that she's been waiting for.</text>

There is street parking and about 50 parking spots in the parking lot.

Inside the main lobby the service countertops have an ample supply of mail forms/slips. Also, I noticed there is a small handful of automated mail machines, which you can use for just about any mail service, including those requiring Certified Mail receipts, insurance etc.
One of the employees showed me how the mail machine works so I can use this next time in case I want to skip the line.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c295153a67f589:0x8c662e64f1baf35e</gmapID></record>

There is new woman running the P.O. Boxes - and if she doesn't recognize a name on the P.O. Box, she sends the packages back - I run a record company, and we get packages for several different people, and we have lost packages, and have had to pay to re-ship packages because this lady is "filtering" the mail - YOUR JOB IS TO DELIVER THE MAIL!...
Most of the people behind the counter are pleasant - but they move very slow - They should treat the lines like they do at grocery stores, when there is a long line, open up a new register to help people move along.
Also - there should be someone who deals with people who have to pick up large packages from their P.O. Boxes, - closing that service at 9:00 a.m. is lame, that should be a service ALL DAY LONG!< /Review>

I would give 0 stars to this establishment if I could. I've been receiving packages at my office for years without any problem until now. Apparently, they claim to know more about how my office system works. The office uses "suites" to determine whose bin a package goes into/who owns an item, but USPS had the gall to tell me that the address is not supposed to have suites since it is not an apartment. I spoke to them several times, but they still refused to make themselves useful. "Oh too bad, there's nothing we can do" or "The address is invalid". Hello-- I already said it was, yet they adamantly insisted that the address cannot have a suite number on it. Incompetent fools!<//text>

I waited all day at home because I knew a package was coming that I needed to sign for. The postwoman finally showed up at 5:30 PM with no package. What good is the tracking system if it isn't truthful? And why couldn't the postwoman tell me why it wasn't in her truck when the tracking system said the package was "Out For Delivery". Completely unacceptable and idiotic.< /Text>

Got a notice that an item I had ordered was "out for delivery".  Never got to me.  I talked to someone at the P.O. several times.  According to him"out for delivery" just means it got to the post office.  It doesn't mean it is actually "out for delivery."  They can't find it.  I have to wait 30 days, contact the sender and have him file a claim.  The post office will only refund him his money for the postage, not for the item.  So, it looks like I'm out of luck.  Pretty poor service if you ask me.< /review>

<Review>Top this:
I was mailing several packages from this post office. Paid with my debit card.  As I was leaving I looked at the receipt and saw that it was significantly more than the mailing price. I stepped back to the clerk who had serviced me and held up the receipt and before I could say anything he said "I must have pressed the cash back from this side."  That criminal pressed $20 class back and pocketed it. I wonder how many times a day he does that.  I took my money--haven't filed charges--but never going back to that place again.< /Review>< GmapID>

When you call, they just say they will ask the carrier.

It's awful the service provided by this post office, letters were returned to the sender instead putting them in the appropriate P.O. BOX, even put sticker on letters saying I was  temporary away from home. A real nightmare. This office is poorly managed.< /text>

Stolen packages, packages delivered to the wrong street, other people's mail in my box, my mail in other people's boxes.  No mail for anyone for almost a week...no Tuesday ads or anything.  When you call, they just say they will ask the carrier.  Packages are often left in the basement where anyone can pick them up because the carrier doesn't want to walk to the apartments they are addressed to or they dump them at the closest apartment.

This is the worst office to come to. I spoke with elaine and her answer to my question was i can't help you. Asked to speak with supervisor and she replied they did not have one. So i told her that response was unacceptable, which then she replied give me a minute. After 25 min Mary came out taking her sweet time while an edelry lady and I where waiting to talk to a supervisor. Her response to the lady and me where the same i can't do anything.
That type of attitude and service is not appreciated specialy when they feed there family from our tax money. Avoid this office if you can time to use other logistics companies.</Review>

This office is the worst in the country!!! I have called over 20 times today and they do not answer the phone.  Yesterday they claim they delivered a package on my front door and that was b.s.  I think they kept it.  The carriers cannot read.  They cannot deliver to the right apartment numbers so they just dump mail in any box.  I have finally had enough and will not order anything that is shipped USPS and will be paying all the bills I can on-line.  Screw this post office!!!!  Please avoid it at all costs to keep your sanity.<//review>

This postal office provides awful service. They didn't deliver my daughter's priority mail on the designated day. They Left a note in her box that an attempt had been made to deliver. Hello! My daughter works from home so that is proof that they never made an attempt to deliver it. Then, four days later I called their number. Phone kept ringing. When I called back, the line was busy. Sick of these people taking my mail for granted. Someone owes me money for my lost package and such.< /review>

<Text>Absolutely the worst postal delivery service in Los Angeles. Despite having a closer post office nearby, this is the one that delivers to me. Whomever is doing the Saturday shift is the absolute worst. Not only did they deliver one of my packages to the wrong apartment at this complex, but they claimed they "tried to deliver" the other package at 8:45 PM (I was home) and didn't leave a door tag. Two weeks ago the same guy left a "we missed you" slip in my mailbox while I was home again, but left it for the wrong post office and didn't write any information in the boxes. I've filed complaints online, filed complaints through the other post office, and I'll be calling to complain some more so I can get some decent service.<//Text>< rating>

<user>100341793009940391263</user><Review>If I could give negative stars I would. I believe this is the worst post office I have ever had to deal with and I have lived in locations all over the USA. I have not received 8 or so packages and have tried to get many packages redelivered with no success. When going to the post office I asked if there was any trouble getting to my apartment and the person on staff wouldn't even humor me and just said it was probably a substitute mail man. 8 times!? When I have called I have been hung up on and there was an occasion that phone was disconnected for 4 days consecutively during the work week. I wish that the entire staff would be fired and replaced. Worse service ever.< /Review>< Date>

We used to have a regular mail carrier, but the last couple of years we seemingly have a different carrier every week.  We have had mail lost (bills with resulted in late charges), mail thrown on the ground, and mail not delivered until after 7 at night.  The service is terrible.  When I try to call the 800 number all I get is recording and no live person to talk to.  Will no need to go over to local PO to loudly complain, taking time out of my day. Not happy!!< /Review>

I went yesterday to United States Sun Valley Post Office to return all the mail that was being sent to the house I rent with different people names using this address from previous people who live in this house will use this address. As they advice me to go visit United States Postal Service in Burbank,CA to make sure all these people don't use this address again.< /review>

<text>This post office has delayed my package and when I call no one answers! Finally they answered today and I explained how I have not received my package. The lady asks what's my zip code, I tell her and she says to hold on. I was literally on the phone waiting for 20 minutes with no response!! I'm at work and had to hang up because I had to get back to what I was doing! I just called back and now it says all circuits are busy now! its horrible!! When I try to track my package its says it has not been updated but yet says it went out for delivery on the 18th and today is the 23! wtf!! it suppose to be an xmas gift and seems like this usps either lost or stole it!!! this is ridiculous!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Incompetence to the nth degree. I went to pick up a package the other day and was flabbergasted with what I encountered. The woman who helped me had poor poor communication skills and her English was difficult to decipher. After having me wait over ten minutes she comes back with a look on her face like "You're out of luck." She told me to come back tomorrow in hopes that they'll find it in the abyss behind her. Instead of admitting that it's lost and helping me get my package refunded she makes a sideways comment about how most people come the day after they get a notice and that's why it's not there (hinting that it's my fault it's lost). I could go on and ramble about how it's unorganized with boxes and papers everywhere; about how the staff doesn't know how to communicate properly with patrons, they lose your items and never apologize, but I think the vast number of 1 and 2 stars speaks for itself. Use a different mailing service if you canm<//Review>

The girl that's here named Kaitlyn is IMHO the best gas station attendant/cashier in the world, yes i said it the whole world.  She does so much for everyone maybe she can take a break and I'll check her oil. In her car.</text>

Not bad but the amount of homeless and derelict people hanging out around the building generally cause me to go elsewhere. I don't want my car broken into or damaged, especially when my child is with me.</Text>

The staff here are always really nice. I like the hot food and I almost always get gas here instead of the Valero across the street. That place is full of weirdos.</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>Sent work order in last Monday asked for the Tech to come on Tuesday to replace kitchen light. Tech came Monday afternoon asked him to come back Tuesday. Tech said no problem. No tech ever came back. Called the office Friday and spoke with Brian. Brian did a lot of talking and told me techs come the same day they cant come a different day. I wanted to ask Brian why my work order was cancelled but I couldn't really get a word in. I then asked Brian if he could send a tech Friday but delay 30minutes since I just got home. He said he couldn't do that and I need to go online and place a new work order when I'm ready.</text>< pictures>

<text>This place is not perfect: Tennis courts either have no nets or need to be replaced, and dog owners are not conscious in picking up after their dogs, and in my opinion, rent is getting a bit too high, but staff is nice and on the corporate level, they do try and work with you. I would encourage security to increase and be more present as well.but not a bad place to live at all</text>< gmapID>

Wow! I have lived at Chesapeake Commons since 2010! Last night our lights went out and I suddenly realized why I love living at Chesapeake! It's the fireplace! Although the power was only off for 30 minutes I felt safe! Having the ability to control your heat in a storm on a cold winter night is worth so much. I started a fire and sat there watching the fire until the lights came back on. It was so warm and toasty! What a real treat that was. I felt a little sad when the lights came back on. Living in an area that has easy access to the freeway is a dream. If has to be one of  the best places to live in the area.
Just a few minutes away,food hardware,banks,and,a community college within 10 minutes from my door. An ideal location to handle all your needs! It's been a blast living here! Have an Awesome New Year! Come check us out!</Text>

Just moved in, happy with location of apt., lots of stores, restaurants, hospitals & close to hwys.. Maintenance staff are great-they get it done quickly!  Admin. staff are great also.  One complaint,,,, PARKING is horrible!   Not enough parking.  I am constantly looking for a spot-& it is usually far from my apt. location.  Being a senior on a limited income, management or owners should provide discounts for covered parking spots close to apt.-for seniors.</text>

Air conditioning unit was not working 90 degrees in my apt. Repair man came said he would return on July 23rd and never came back. Called the office stated they had no record of repair man coming to my apt. Stated the maintenance man could return tomorrow afternoon. It’s suppose to get to 102 today on July 24th. This is the 3rd time they were suppose to fix my air conditioning unit. Very frustrated and hot. I think the maintenance should have come back and if not should have come back the following day in the morning not the next afternoon. Didn’t feel the leasing office was much help.<//text>

<Text>UPDATE SINCE LAST REVIEW: I would first like to suggest removing the current office staff and replacing it with better people who actually do care about the residents and who actually WILL make things happen for me to be comfortable here. It is ridiculous how Josh is the only one who knows about the finances and the guy talks in circles. The property manager there is also rude. I called in to request information about what they are doing about COVID since there was NO COMMUNICATION ABOUT IT and she had an attitude with me and was very rude. I never called the office again unless it was for a maintenance request. I called upper property management regarding this and expressed my concerns about my apartment and she never got back to me. I do not feel cared for and valued in this complex and I refuse to speak with the office staff about any concerns I have because there’s just no point. Nothing will get done about it.

Another thing that needs to be changed is separating the utilities from the rent. That is inconvenient, unlawful, and inconsiderate how they combined it and my paycheck does not cover that. Leases MUST be renewed if you’re going to do this!

Here’s another thing: GET RID OF THE $20 MONTHLY FEE FOR PARKING IN A SPACE! I pay too much money in rent to have to pay for that! It should be included!!

Lastly, the apartment complex has trash and dog poop everywhere! I’m always seeing soda cans, trash, clothes, and dog poop not picked up, especially near my apartment. Have your maintenance people pay MORE attention to the apartment grounds!

Even after reading all of this, I know and feel that nothing will be changed. All the property management will do is respond to me and say, “We’re sorry for this and that...” and blah blah blah. Don’t even respond because you can’t and you WON’T make my experience here better.

To the people considering moving here, I hope you have a better experience than me and many other residents I’ve spoken to. We all have the same issues with this complex but we refuse to speak with management about them because nothing will be done about it, which is why we can’t wait to move elsewhere when our leases are up. Choose wisely!

I feel that the move-in process could have been way better. I did not know the office staff member I was in contact with no longer worked at this complex and no one contacted me to follow up and take the lead to assist me with my move-in. I had to keep contacting the office. Also, I would highly suggest implementing a smoke-free policy. People who do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana should not have to deal with second hand smoke or the smell left behind from people who smoked in the apartment previously.  I greatly appreciate the help the office staff has provided me, but I ended up buying a candle in the end since the cigarette smell is in the air filter.

Another thing, they tell you to pay for covered parking and they say that they don’t put apartment numbers on the carport when others have them! What kind of business is this? The office staff has rubbed me the wrong way since I moved here a month ago. Don’t rent here, stay away!

To the owner who replied, there’s no way I’m coming in to address the issue. Nothing is going to be solved!<//Text><username>Stefeni Brown</username>< Rating>

I decided not to move forward with the application move process and the complex kept my $250 deposit! Yep you guess it! No refund. They said it was some sort of back rent policy (mind you, I never even moved in lol) moral of this story is DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE ANY MONEY UNLESS YPU ARE 100000000%sure you’re going to live there.

<Text>Having at least one parking spot (carport) and (Free) no charge and have it by your apartment, we do pay a lot as it is for rent and utilities we should at least get that. I've had to park very far one night after work and I had to walk alone very late because there was no parking near my apartment or around the corner. Also with landscaping they leave a mess all over the pathway/sidewalk and it trails into the apartment. Otherwise, I really do love living here just too expensive.

Finally got out of this hell-hole. Had a walk-through and was told that everything looked good and that the only deduction from the deposit would be the carpet cleaning (check your lease for the small print). Well, SURPRISE (or not), they came up will all kinds of BS deductions and kept all but about $30 of my deposit. Guess that's the cost of doing business with this HORRIBLE place.

If ZERO stars were an option, that's what I would give this DUMP. The old office staff were HORRIBLE people and the new office staff are even worse. Corporate is just as horrible too. They will do ANYTHING to keep your deposit and cheat you out of money. DO NOT LIVE IN THIS PLACE! Find anywhere else!

** I find it hilarious that you would even bother to reply. This is the most polite of a response I have ever received from the staff. I'd come visit you in the office, yet again, if I thought for 1 second that it might make a bit of difference, however, I know better. Can't wait until I can get out of this DUMP!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We moved from a neighboring complex very dissatisfied with their management and lack of response to maintenance concerns. Our walls were paper thin and we could hear everything, including our upstairs neighbor vacuuming at midnight. To which management would not address. We are so absolutely thrilled we moved to chesapeake and couldn't be happier with the communication, the management, the maintenance and quality of our apartment.</Text>

<Review>How about you try not raising the rent EVERY SINGLE TIME A LEASE IS REKNEWED! iN THE FOUR YEARS i HAVE BEEN THERE, THE MONTHLY RENT HAS GONE FROM $999 TO $1409! That is a 40% increase and it is highly unlikely my pay, or any other average persons pay has increased 40% since then. Try to offer me a lease without raising the  rent this time and I can consider staying. Otherwise I will have to not re-knew and leave.

<review>Management has been nice and the tour went well. I Just found much higher quality apartments with 0 bad or skeptical reviews so I went with them. I would have tried here possibly if I didnt find the amazing ones i stay in now.

My complaint: Still waiting on my refund of my holding deposit, its been 5 days short of a whole month ive been waiting. Chesapeake (to my knowledge) isnt the one who handles the check directly but still. It takes 5 seconds to take my money out my account for the holding deposit but basically a month to return it??????<//review><time>1569273922518<//time><response>{'time': 1569344008898, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.

Wish I could give them no starts. There is some kind of "policy", that I have yet to be shown a copy of, that states if you cancel the $250 intial fee within the 72 hour time frame it will take 21 BUSINESS DAYS TO RECEIVE A CHECK! It was taken off of my debit card in nothing flat, but because we decided to go with another complex we have to wait a month for a paper refund?!?! I am contacting their corporate office, because I have still not received a copy of this policy after repeated requests.< /Review>

<Review>Where to start? The staff is really nice and knows their job well. They are quick when it comes to maintenance, getting things done. The complex is always kept clean and looking its best, not only the access that is given for gyms and tennis courts. If I could rate this place more than 5 stars I definitely would.< /Review>< Pics>

BEYOND RUDE AND EXTREMELY FULL OF PESTS! From the rude as hell manager Sylvia to the fake Lori and Lara.  These people absolutely lack the skills necessary to deal with the public.  I personally feel they are miserable and quite pathetic.  I personally know of a lady that lost her husband and because he was the bread winner, she needed a little additional time to come up with the money to pay the rent.  She was a few days late and they refused to accept her payment.  They turned her over to collections and she was living in her car for 2 weeks.  I personally have had nothing but rudeness from these sad and very pathetic people.  Sylvia used to work at California Place Apartments and is now at Chesapeake Commons.  I'm sure she probably had to be transferred so that one of the people living in that complex didn't attack her.  I'm shocked she is as bold as she is. Lori talks condescending and Lara is so rude that it seems like her face should hurt.  I'm sure glad I moved out of their mice and roach infested apartment complex.  They're a complete joke and I don't wish this filthy place on anyone.<//review>

The staff is very quick to respond to any repairs that need to be done. Very friendly when adding a tenant name onto the lease, and helpful when adding a pet to our lives and how the process would work. Love the newly remodeled interior and exterior, quiet community, close to hwy 50 and nightly security. Multiple pools, hot tubs, tennis courts and fitness center indoor washer and dryer and walk in closets!< /Review>

I am changing my review in light of the apartment complex yet again shutting off our water WITHOUT WARNING!! What makes this worse is that you are required to pay for water while you live here. What that money goes toward is a mystery for me but it isnt for the actual maintenance and repair of the system. 2-4 times a month for our water to be cut off due to repairs is unacceptable. Here is a shocker, at the time of me leaving this review my water was shut off due to repairs!!< /Text>

The staff at Chesapeake Commons is outstanding! They are friendly, responsive and efficient.  The apartment itself is comfortable and aesthetically pleasing with upgraded amenities such as fireplaces, in-home laundry and balconies.

<rating>5< /rating><text>I just got done talking with one of the Agents at Chesapeake Commons Apartments and his name was Elliot, I think but just one of the most genuine best customer service quality's I love about a person. I had called because of the ad that was listed on Craigslist and I wanted to get some information about there bonds program which is a great idea for someone who has limited income and just moving out here from another state. I feel like this is the place for me. That call that I made today and the Agent name Elliot was the best Marketing customer service person. We need people like him to not only sell but to have knowledge about what there selling you and with good customer service. I'm so looking forward for my appointment with them next week because just seeing the pictures the call that just blew me away. Made me a happy customer. Thank You. Catherine L.</text>< Pictures>

Worst apartment complex there is. Management is joke here. They said if there is ever a problem it will be fixed within 3 hours. Took them 3 days. When you walk through the model apartment it's a bait and switch on what you really get. They say you will get and pay for an "upgraded unit" when it's just a basic unit with a microwave.
Save your money and live somewhere else. You will thank yourself in the long run.<//review>

WORST APARTMENT COMPLEX! First off they have rats! The showers are moldy and no matter how many times you clean and bleach, it just keeps coming back because they didn’t caulk the tub correctly. Sean in the office knows nothing about this complex and was the worst guide. Every time we call about a question he has no idea what the rules are and the price he gave for our apartment was $300 less than what we are paying now. Also there is trash and dog poop every where you walk. The kids that live here throw garbage and the pool chairs into the pools and hot tub as well as staying out there until 12am yelling even though the sign says it closes at 8pm. Turn and run from this POS! You will regret living here.<//Text>

< review>
Worst Renting Experience Ever. Only Stayed for 4 Months. Carpet was new when moved in and i cleaned myself. apparently in 4 months the carpet was so bad it cost 400 to clean it. BS... Rude service upon moving out gave me 4 days to pay and because my mail where i moved to was slow i got sent to collections. thanks Chesapeake for screwing my credit. This Place is shady. Also While living there my infant son started to get sick. checked to see if there was a hepa filter installed in hearer/ac unit as i was told it was and i was charged for. No Filter present in the apartment at all just mold stains and dust. Also found mold in walls in both bathrooms. Stay away if you love your family.<//review>

hire staff who can remedy tenants complaints
staff who can deal with tenants who are abusive, arrogant, scrupulous & un-respectful to their neighbors peace.
provide tenants thru writing your guidelines and protocol on how to handle tenants complaints and problems.
every tenants pays their rent, so everyone deserves to sleep peacefully at night and undisturbed with unnecessary noise during day time.<//Review>

<date>1511898198110</date><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>This place has a habit of not refunding people's deposits. They like to keep your money, stating that they found urine stains on the carpet from your pet, when in fact you don't own a pet. When I moved in, I had to reclean the entire place. They had painted over the dirt on the walls & vents. Management conducts business very unofficial. They are rude to tenants when they come in with issues concerning their apartments. They don't move on issues of concern at all. I would never move back there & I would never recommend anyone to move their. Only reason they received the star is because I didn't have the choice of giving them zero stars. This property & it's management personnel needs to be under investigation. And this is jus my personal opinion...< /Review>< user>

<rating>2</rating><Review>I moved in to Chesapeake back in November,  I signed a year's lease because I felt that I wanted to make this long term, plus I really like the area. Well my excitement quickly faded , because I started getting notices on my door that the management/maintenance needed to come in for a variety of compliance issues and to check everything for the city. At first it was fine, because I understand that some regulations aren't generated solely by the office. Then it seems like I got notices all the time (at last count I have at least 10-11 since moving in since November)  I brought it up to the management office and was told to "have patience with them". I feel I have been patient enough and if I would of wanted maintenance in my place all the time then I would have gotten them to sign the lease with me and been my roommates.  It feels very intrusive, for them always being in my place and then when they come in, they don't leave my place the way I have left it (ie. Blinds closed, cabinets left open) Then my upstairs neighbors are raucous and always making a ton of noise day and night. Totally oblivious to the fact that they have downstairs neighbors. Trash is always overflowing and a bunch of it ends up on the ground, opening up breeding grounds for all types of varmints. I DEFINITELY will NEVER renew my lease here at all. I cannot wait till my lease is up in November. Counting down the days. I would recommend anyone considering living here to ask a few questions for starters:
1. How responsive is the management team.
2. How many inspections will they conduct ???? (Trust me it's a lot)
3. Section 8......
4. If you can have an upstairs unit... specially if you have loud banshee neighbors.
5. If you want to get out of your lease...how it works...
(You have to give 2 months notice btw)
Just be informed...get all questions answered....don't believe the hype and fluff.

<username>Teena Marie<//username><date>1537386685701< /date><rate>1< /rate><Review>We moved from the bay area and at first thought C.C was a nice place to live. The maintainence workers always fixed what needed to within 20 minutes for us. The Building we was at for the 3 years was quiet. Neighbors are friendly. But then the shutting off water notices started. Every few weeks the water gets shut off from 8am til 5pm. When it was time to leave (which was a blessing) they charged for everything. Things we didn't even use. We did get charged for the carpet ($200-$300) but i mean it's hard to keep a carpet clean for 3 years with 2 kids. They do have a small problem with unwanted crawling guests. As for patrol.... It's a little pointless. He will drive around some but be parked for most the time. He comes off as a lil creeper.
So glad to have moved out. Got a bigger place without unwanted visitors. Woo-hoo come up.<//Review>< pictures>

Every staff member here is amazing from maintenance to management. I've worked with several prop management in the area and in Yolo County and by far Chesapeake has been the best.

Chad specifically has been great to work with in both clearing up issues and assisting with maintenance problem resolutions.

The key to working with customers and communication and these guys nail it. They send out paper notices of any work that would impact you as a renter and also send text messages if you sign up for it.

You should really consider this place if your going to move into the Rancho Cordova  area!<//text>

Hi There</name>
<Rating>1</Rating>< review>
How can i put minus 5 stars on here! The manager here is a real piece of work. This is why the incompetents are running the insane asylum Jacking the rent up for this place is a joke. They have done 4 remodels and they want you to pay for parking and some appliances. Maintenance is a joke, where the hell did they get those people? I found cheaper rent and better maintenance people at River Pointe Apts. I used to live at Cheaspuke Commons and glad i got the hell out of there.<//review>

The apartment views from the street is amazing but living here the complex is a bit shady...weird people walking around. Firstly, you have to pay for covered parking. Secondly, you share water with your building and split the bill which I find is ridiculous! Then the trash is always full! You can clearly hear your neighbors through the walls! The faucet makes noise like a haunted house and the cupboards are all old and broken. I don't think we will resign.< /Text><name>Juanita Vyfhuis< /name><UserId.>106445444703197727564< /UserId.><Date>1477543180190<//Date></record></dataset><record>

The management staff are rude, unprofessional, and they talk to you like you are one of there subordinate. I googled the company and see they own a lot of communities across the state.
Shame on the owners of Chesapeake Commons to employe a staff like this to represent your company.
I wish I did better research on the community before I moved in. I only been here less than 6 months and I see and heard tenants vent there frustration and even seen a tenant in the office about to give a beat down on the management because of how rude they spoke to her in front of her kids. Shame on the owners once again to have your employees represent your company in the manner that they do.
I have complained about all the trash and smells that come from the dumpster which leads to roaches,  rats and mice. Being a spouse of a military man this living condition is getting like a third world, when management shows you they don't care the tenants follow suit. I will definitely not be renewing my lease and I will tell anyone don't get fooled by the office on how pleasant they seem, it changes 180 once you sign the dotted line.  Shame on owners, may be you should do *Undercover Boss* to get the real story of your employees and there interaction with tenants and there resolution.</text>

<Text>Staff needs to be trained in customer service soft skills. If I'm calling in regards to my application, because I'm trying to rent from you, don't hang up on me. If I'm asking for information or advice on how to handle a situation, don't repeat yourself over and over again. Making people feel small or stupid is unacceptable. To top it off, a co-worker lives there and has told me how many times his cars been broken into and how they are accepting everyone and anyone, and how poor the community has become, yet I was still willing to live there due to how close to my job it would be... never mind. No wonder he's moving. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPLEX.<//Text><rating>1</rating><Resp>{'time': 1460388756526, 'text': "Cynthia- Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

Do not, please do not rent from here. I've lived all over the country and have NEVER had so many issues with an apartment.
The first of many things on the cons list is that the water gets turned off twice a month for an entire day. We've been here a year now, and they are still doing unscheduled maintenence.  Now I'm a fair person... if they paid water, sewage, trash then I'd be more lenient,  but we are charged $100 a month or else we'd be evicted.
Next is the so called renovations.  They replaced the windows, but never fixed the paneling afterwards around the doors and windows. Also taking a chunk from our wall in the process.
We were told we had a new washer/dryer, but when it broke down there was garbage underneath it dated several years earlier.
Also the security isn't all the best. A guy who wanders around the neighborhood threatened to kick my dog a few weeks back.

We just got our charges from them. They charged us for things without doing a walk through with us. We were told that they would call us to schedule it, even after we went there to do the walk through.<//Text>

<Text>I have live at Chesapeake Commons for almost 6 years. Living in such a huge complex has its plus side. Chesapeake is a community all by itself.  You can walk around and get your cardio without leaving the property! An awesome fitness room that provides tenants with privacy to workout when you wish. The staff has always been professional and repairs have been made in a timely manner. I have read some of the reviews and it just isn't fair to judge the entire complex by some past tenants experiences. I can't imagine trying to maintain such a huge property. Trying to keep everyone happy is near impossible! I have lived in smaller complexes that  weren't handled as well as Chesapeake.  I personally have never had a situation where I could not talk to management if I had a question. Sylvia Gamboa, our current property manager and her staff  have turned this complex into a place I'm proud to call home. There will always be people who are unhappy about something and I simply want to say that we are the best complex in Rancho Cordova and I am happy to live here. When people complain about something I simply say what are "you" doing to make the situation better? I feel safe and the grounds are clean and well maintained. With so many people from so many diverse backgrounds Chesapeake Commons is makes it work!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Nothing good about these apartments. They charge for parking, water and sewer are seperate charges, parking is terrible (not assigned close to apartment) the staff don't care about issues with anything. No microwave in apartment, or shower doors. The models they show you are nice but, what you get is completely different. I had a banking error with a bounced check and was forced to pay with money orders for 6 months. Verry cold and inflexible staff. Save some headache and stay away!<//text>

My family and I moved into Chesapeak Commons in 2008. We wanted something affordable and small. The place provided a decently size living room and somewhat smaller than normal kitchen, but it's something that should be expected when moving into an apartment.

After living there for 10 years already, we very slowly disliked the location, but since we had no money, we had to live with the negatives...but for 10 years.

The first thing is MAINTENANCE. It ridiculous on the timeframe they gave you for the maintenance people to come and fix a certain item in your place. We had to fix our washer and dryer, oven (that was never fixed, which I'll explain why soon), replace our microwave, fix our sink and food dispenser, and lastly a major leak from the washer that spread  throughout the whole living room. Now all of these problems did not happen in a short period. It happened over time. What my we didn't like was that the maintenance people took too long to come by and FIX the problems that was happening. Their time frame to fix something was between 9am to 5pm and a specific day/date would be given. That is a long time between those the time frame. Someone would have to be home to ensure the door is unlocked and ready to ask questions just in case. BUT 80% of the time, THEY DO NOT SHOW UP. They did not show up AND did not give a notice that they would not show up. IF THEY DID SHOW UP, they would look at the problem, THEN schedule another day to fix it, AND BY GOD if we are lucky if they stick between the time frame. WE HATED IT EVERYTIME they missed the time frame. Of course we know there is other units that need to be fixed, but GIVE THE TENANTS A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME ON A CERTAIN DATE THAT THEY ARE DEFINITELY READY TO COME BY. We called the office, but there excuse was that it was up to the maintenance if they would be done or not with their previous fix.

Next the neighborhood and the area is not a safe area. We have seen people move in and move out for a long time. Their reasons are on their own, but what we have noticed was the following: multiple cars pass by playing loud hip hop/pop/rnb or just ghetto music late at night, someone stole a car part under our vehicle at night, someone BURNED a marijuana plant above our unit that caused the fire department to come by to assess the situation, we found 7 (yes we counted) people sneaking around the master bedroom window and their reason was that they were peeing, and lastly the individuals that move in are not THAT nice to other tenants.

They made multiple upgrades to the apartment, which is a positive thing about Chesapeake Commons. Every year since 2008, they increased our monthly pay for a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom unit. So, make sure you're reading your lease agreement if you're planning on renewing it. They assigned parking for the units, upgraded other people's equipment, improved the decoration for the clubhouse for parties, and made sure the grass is always green, which was not always trimmed before the upgrades and new policy changes.

The agents seem nice at first, but what I think is very intimidating about them is that they seem to NOT care about the tenants needs. One individual, though, who is nice and reasonable is Laurie. Before we finally moved out in 2017, she understood our situation of how short in money we were, so she helped us out definitely. I would recommend seeing her first and foremost about anything. EVERYBODY ELSE seem like they are about to find something wrong OR trying to find something wrong in your apartment and try to charge you. They don't call you or anything but instead stick a paper on your door, so it makes you WORRY and always LOOK over your shoulder. IT keeps you not safe from any ACCIDENTAL or a small mistake you did. THEY WILL CHARGE YOU NO MATTER WHAT. IF MAINTENANCE COMES BY, THEY WILL TELL THE AGENTS OF ANYTHING THAT SEEMS OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

So DO YOUR RESEARCH OF THE PLACE. AND IF YOU COULD,  DECIDE ANOTHER PLACE IF POSSIBLE. THIS PLACE SHOULD BE YOUR LAST RESORT. Please and thank you.<//review>

The part of Chesapeake I live in is pretty quiet. I enjoy this complex greatly but I find myself being CONSTANTLY bombarded with notices from the staff regarding maintenance. Since I started living here, I've received at least 8-10 documents on my door regarding when water was going to be shut off (sometimes for the ENTIRE day) or when staff would need to 'check something in my unit' or paint the exterior of my building. Doesn't sound like much, but can you imagine receiving a document at least once a month stating the very NEXT day your water would be off the entire day? That's terrible! Parking lot leaves a bit to be desired as well. Not a bad place to live otherwise, but I can't in good conscience recommend this place for those that DO NOT LIKE TO BE INCONVENIENCED.  **Been a resident since December 2014...will not be one after March 2016**<//Review>

DONT RENT HERE! DONT RENT HERE! DONT RENT HERE! DONT RENT HERE!

ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES

BLACK WIDOWS

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

CONSTANT WATER SHUT OFF NOTICES

SINCE DECEMBER 26, 2016 MANAGEMENT AND STAFF ARE IN VIOLATION OF HEALTH & SAFETY CODES, DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE, GENERAL CODE, & DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. CONSTANT HARASSMENT and EFFORTS MADE IN RETALIATION  FOR REPORTING VIOLATIONS TO RANCHO CORDOVA CODE ENFORCEMENT.

Manager Sylvia Gamboa and staff under direction of general manager Dave Tanfaran are severely lacking in any ethics or morals related to landlord responsibilities as sited in CA Law.

If you have maintenance issues they get pissed off at you for creating work for them. They begin retaliation and start harassing you. Leaving 3 day notices for any reason at all, threaten to tow your vehicle, pull your rent late and then charge you late fees, charge you $50/month rent for a washer and dryer that are so small you cant wash blankets in them. $15/month for a carport space where you have water puddles to avoid, over flowing trash enclosures, car was broken into twice and items stolen, dog crap all over, the pool and spa have been closed for 5 months, they don't honor their word at all! They refused to honor the gift certificate I won at their BBQ for a carpet cleaning. They told me I could use it at any time when I won it. Then when I tried to use it they told me it was no longer valid. Said I had to use it within 30 days of winning it but I won it the 1st day I moved in so I didn't need it then. NEVER said this anywhere on the gift certificate.  Then they threatened to evict me when I argued with them that they had to honor it I had it in writing. Washer flooded but took them forever to replace it and tried to place the new one before I finished cleaning out the debris and drying the water from the walls. Then they bent the drain pan when installing the new one. The list goes on and on. My advice is to simply rent elsewhere and save yourself the hassle and headache.</Text>

<Text>the apartment itself is ok. the complex is a little ghetto but its so huge you never have to see anyone.
FIRST off my girlfriend and I moved in back in 2010-2011 I believe. When an apt opened up we went and looked at it and it wasn't finished but the lady who showed it to us said the high traffic area in front of the door needed to be cleaned again and they didn't paint the accent wall. We picked a color from their samples and finished up paperwork. we were supposed to move in 3 days later so we rented a u-haul and loaded everything up the night before. We show up to move in the day and time we were told and the apt was not ready, they offered us another apt upstairs by the pool. we declined. now this put us in the "do we keep the truck loaded for another and pay for another day" or move into this apt we didnt want by the pool that will be loud?
so we went to go look and see what needed to be done in our first apt. nothing was done at all, we were the last people to be in it 3 days before. so out of pure we really don't have another choice we just said screw it we'll take it like this and send somebody over to paint in the next couple days so we can unpack. they wall never got painted and the carpet never got cleaned. When we did the walk through I marked every tiny spec the human eye could see top to bottom wall to wall. i ran out of room to mark things. the carpet and wall were noted also. good to go.
me and my girlfriend breakup and I move out a few months before the lease is up but still helped with the bills and I was still spending time and the night there occasionally. When she moved out she had all her sisters and I come and help clean. it wasn't very hard because we kept the place fairly squared away. the kitchen was the biggest problem which it always is with most. We left the place looking better then we got it.
So apparently this is how they get their bonuses or have a hustle where they take all of your deposit and say it was uses to clean the entire apt because of the mess then do another inspection and tell their boss its good to go no cleaning needed and pocket the money.
I read another review just now that says pretty much the same thing.
out apt never got painted or carpet cleaned, so whos deposit was that before us that never got used?
my girlfriend was informed that we actually OWED THEM MONEY because they had to steam clean the walls and replace the carpet...seriously a joke. To take the entire deposit and say we still owe is a mystery to me.
my girlfriend after moving out into another apt on the same street said she talked to the lady there and worked something out. apparently she didnt write down or forgot to note about the wall and carpet. THE REASON WHY IT WASNT READY FOR US THAT MORNING.
my GF told me that the lady told her it would be taken care of. NOPE! whatever she did or did not do still left us a balance that got forwarded to some collection agency.

I just found this out a few weeks ago...from 2011

Responsibility 	Individual Account.
Balance 	$192
High Balance 	$140
Remarks 	Consumer disputes this account information

absolutely I do. what a rip off. someone there was or is running a scam and ruining peoles credit and I didnt even know about it.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Took forever to get our two coffees and then when we got them they were so sweet my husband couldn't finish it, gave it to our 15 year old son who couldn't finish it either. I drank mine and ended up sick. Too sweet and too long of a wait.< /review><user_id>117424987184184539424</user_id>< date>

I really like Starbucks. Good food and good service plus grt. Coffees the only thing I can say about it is I wish they had bigger cups, like Dutch Bros has. Dutch Bros by the way has good coffees too.<//text>

Tried the sous vide egg bites for the first time, they were very good. It's too bad that this Starbucks location is closing at the end of the month. It is located in a good central meeting location for I and many of my friends.< /Review>

The employees are always friendly & helpful. I had some papers to go over with a notary, we ended up not getting done before closing,  they let us stay & finish up! It was super kind of them.<//review>

My favorite Starbucks in town you can sit in a clean and spacious environment. The people behind the counter always make me laugh. There is no drive thru and no place to put a bike... but I still enjoy going there when I can.</review>

Clean shop, friendly staff, nice selection.  It's on a busy intersection, so it can be a bit tricky to get in/out, but definitely worth it over the other shop across the street.<//Review>

<text>A decent place to meet up over coffee to chat with a friend. No drive thru if you're on the go. Room is a bit loud. I wish they could improve the acoustics to be a little more subdued. But free WI Fi is always useful.< /text><date>1472922826258</date>< pictures>

<review>Super kind staff! Even if it is cooperate . . . It's a shame that they close so early. My understanding is that they close early because of the Redding freak show.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>The worst service I have gotten from a starbucks staff. And I have been from Chico, San Francisco, Alhambra, Red Bluff, Madrid, Barcelona, Yuba City, Sacramento and even in Beijin China Starbucks. Not once I have gotten a bad service like I did from this Redding chain. Not only they filled my coffe cup half way with foam but gave me the wrong order. To top it off, I got questined as to why my cup was not filled up, and yelled at to wait my turn when there was nobody around. Not even an apology for their incompetence and lack of prudence.  Customers, please be aware of this starbucks personnel. Extremely rude staff. Not worth your time and money.<//Text>< Date>

The specialist Pink is great. She was efficient and detailed. My daughter and I walked in n she was available and willing to service us. Her nail designs was nice. The prices was affordable. All in all my daughter liked her nails and so did I.<//review>

Great service, very detailed manicure and very reasonable prices. When I smudged my nail after walking out the door she fixed it immediately! Great spot.</Text>

I needed a fill badly. Called my usual early to get an appointment or if another tech could do it. His response was I can come in at 3pm for an appointment but other than that no one was available...really? At noontime not one tech available? That's fine I wont be going back.
Walked into Tip O Nails, requested a fill and started getting worked immediately. V did an awesome job! My nails look great. V was thorough in doing my nails. I've had a pedi and eyebrows done there before without a problem. Looks like I'm going to make this my new nail shop.< /Text>

I went to this place got a short set by Joanne, that was horrible, my pedicure was also horrible. I should have know when I saw how dirty the place was and the unprofessional customer service, I have to go get my nails and toes redone I can’t  go around looking like this. Do not waste your money.<//Text>

Today I wanted to see my regular lady. But she wasn't  in yet. So Joann did my nails and eye brows for me. She did a very good job. She has been added to my backup list. Also the lady(I didn't catch her name) that did my feet was awesome too!!!! Not even there a full hour... Great visit today!!!!🐞</text>

<text>Horrible experience, I was a walk in at 9am. And the lady barely spoke English. Super dirty in there. Made me sit on an office chair instead of the pedi spa chairs. Even  though I pointed at them  and said do those not work? The nail polish was old and dusty no variety of colors. Then another lady came in who spoke more english and so I asked her do the spa chairs not work and she told me yes and said it’s more expensive. And I told her ok well i don’t mind paying more, why didn’t she say that and her excuse was she doesn’t speak good English. But what i don’t understand is how did she under stand everything else i said. At least have a menu with prices if your not going to have English speaking people.  They made me feel like I was being stereotyped and just assumed I couldn’t afford it. After already feeling some type of way about it being dirty in there plus not having any colors and feeling stereotyped I decided to not give them my business. And as I was walking  out they were speaking their language and laughing. I highly recommend people who can afford a little more then 20 bucks for a pedi to go elsewhere. That place and the employees are disgusting not just the shop but the way they treat customers.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

People seemed nice. Real community vibe among the patrons and some of the staff. Problem as a new customer was that I think it was kinda assumed what I wanted. Which caused a problem when I was done. Luckily, it was resolved without too much hassle :)

Not sure I would recommend this place but my view may change after another visit

I’ve been coming to Joann aka Chao since 01/02/2009. When Chyna refused me. Even after making an appointment. No worries. Joann does it EXACTLY how I love it. Even if she gets her times mixed up, I patiently wait. I love her.</review>

Decent for a low price. There is nothing luxurious about this place and please do not dare to ask them not to use a drill on your natural nails.  That's like asking them to give up their first born.

It's also a cash only spot, so stop by the atm before you go there.<//review>

<text>Their customer service experts are worth mentioning! A rep came up TO ME to assist with my purchase and walked me directly to the section I needed! Not like other stores in the same mall where the reps get a look of fear in their eyes when you make eye contact and look like they want to duck out around the corner!
Have to add, the cashier was above and beyond explaining the rewards program. I will go back!!<//text><UserId.>103669399345483641661</UserId.>< Rate>

Anyplace that has a price match garentee and sells airpods is my kinda place. Especially recommend for those avoiding throwing more money at places like Walmart but still not trying to be bled dry by price-hikes</Review>

These guys are amazing at their jobs. In a small town, they don't have the same resources as the big stores yet they deliver BIG TIME! Keep up the great work.</Text>

UPDATE: I called back and asked to speak with the manager--she is a manager. She said she was super busy earlier, apologized, and helped me figure out what I needed. She was very helpful this second time. I also apologized for hanging up. Rating this 3 stars instead of 1.

I don't write reviews, but the customer service was so atrocious I felt compelled. I called with a simple question: Do you have any two-line phones that a headset can be plugged into? Their answer was "Come in and check yourself." Unbelievable. I explained that I work late and will get there by the skin of my teeth at 8 PM--she said nothing, so I hung up.</Text>

<text>I couldn't be more upset. Two girls behind the counter (Clarissa and dark girl oversized glasses not displaying a name tag.)They talked down to me the entire time and also printed the most expensive color prints. I never asked for that. So I asked for the cheapest copies. But when a man came in they were more than helpful with him, gross!
I knew I should have given my business to the local copy and print place.
The documents being printed were time sensitive.
They couldn't care less. They repeatedly wanted me to use the self print center. But I didn't know how. Plus there was no one else in line!
I've learned my lesson. If you want something or anything printed don't go to the Sonora ca Staples!< /text>< username>

I have been going into Staples in Sonora for years but have never written a review for them. I just want to say that they give you the small town warm and fuzzy feel by the way they take such good care of you! Aaron in the print department is amazing! He can take care of three or four folks at the same time and get you all out of there in a heartbeat with a big smile on your face! I have to have work done all the time and this guy gets it! Thanks Aaron! Thanks to Maria in your department too! You guys and gals are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</review>

I had a very pleasant experience i went in to get some ink for my printer and some for my calculator.  Michael was very knowledgeable on it and helped me because i can never find anything in a store .  I actually hate shopping and impatient and i would leave if i dont get help when i need something.  I just want to tell you how much he helped i even got other things that i needed and probably would not have purchased them.  So thanks for hiring him.                Barbara kearney< /text>

Employees who didn't know how to work their own machines. Took 1 hour to simply print 100 pages. Unbelievable.</Review>

< Review>
I needed to fax some legal documents to an agent.  The first question they asked me was it lost distant.  I responded does it matter these days because most rates are the same.  Anyway,  I faxed 19 pages, cost was over $40.00.  The agent just called and said all of the copies are difficult to read.  I need to either mail of refax.   I will call the store for a refund and probably dispute.</Review>

We use a lot of ink cartridges and  they are supposed to give credit for them, but  for the last 16 turned in, they said we have no credit coming.  Do they do this on purpose or is it an accident?<//text>

<Review>Whomever hired the unprofessional girl behind the counter probably should slap themselves...That girl needs to GO, i mean she was so rude when I went to swap a battery out covered thru warranty. She refused to believe i don't have to pay, and by the time she caught onto the transaction, wisdom led me out the door and to ANY other place that didn't provoke me to such rage!

I called AAA and they contracted the job out to S&J Services. I am very happy that they did. Rafael came out quickly to handle our situation. He was very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. He diagnosed our battery, replaced it, and answered all the questions and concerns I had. These are the moments that make you appreciate your AAA membership.<//review>

Needed a tow. They were great and fast. If you car breaks down in the Pomona-Claremont I would definitely suggest them. Couldn't ask for a better driver. :) thanks for the tow!< /review>

<Text>One employee of this place hit my truck on the left rear wheel on the 10 east, 15 north ramp. After a few phone calls and emailed pictures the coward owner does not answer or return my calls. This is a company that displays the AAA logo and is recommended by them as well which i don't understand why if they are so dishonest.< /Text>< Pictures>

Good gas and price per gallon. Courteous,clean and consistent! I get a large coffee every time I  fill up, excellent coffee  for only 2.25 . Thanks Lompoc Fuel . Good job guys, keep it going! Remember,  lower fuel means  more patrons, more patrons make  the shift  fly by!</Text>

It's a very clean and well kept business. The store and bathrooms are always open, even through this virus when other places have closed their restrooms. Chevron is open, their floors are moped,paper towels, toilet paper and soap always available. The place is well kept and clean, inside AND outside.
Thank you Chevron especially the PM and Night shift. You know who you are "Thank you"</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I’m a regular customer because I need good gas for my motorcycle. Chevron is the best. I was in this station just yesterday to get gas. I came by today because I had a low tire. On my motorcycle. Anyone who rides can appreciate the need! The employee who was working not only had her kids with her behind the register “helping”, but she refused to turn the air on for me since I did not buy anything. This is unlawful. I now hate this Chevron.
UPDATE: Followed up with this with the manager, who ARGUED with me about the issue, and said “It’s only a buck for air! Why should I give free air to everyone? The law only states that I have the air/water available”
His refusal to keep an unhappy customer happy cost him mine/ my family’s business due to his bad attitude.</text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Horrible experience. When we got to the window our order had been deleted and had to be replaced. We were asked to pull forward and waited for an unreasonable amount of time. After a short ride home we discovered my husbands whopper was mushy and had cheese(asked for no cheese). My sons whopper junior had a tiny patty that didn't even cover half of the bun. To top it off all of the food was cold. We tried calling and they have taken their phone off the hook!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Normally  I been eating at burger King over mc Donald's, but today ordered a whopper meal deal the girl said I had pick size of unflavored ice tea, I said I wanted to one for $7.99 she i had to pick what size of drink , I replied  the 7.99 one , she still insisted that tell her what size drink. I thought I was getting my meal for what the sign said got food rung up it came to 10.00 dollars. So I told her I think I'll  change to another fast food company. That charges the price stated on sign.  Left upset.< /Review>< user_id>

Avoid this place!! I hate to be so critical, but my experience wasn't just their incompetence but the manager was extremely rude and unwilling to correct the multiple wrongs they made. I didn't even receive 2 of the 4 sandwiches ordered, got the wrong drinks repeatedly, and had to knock on the door just to be let in and try to get it fixed. It's literally taken over an hour to get my simple order of 4 meals fixed and not a single sorry. To top it off, I ended up having to pay an extra $5 to get my order right and still deal with their mistakes and the ridiculous wait time. All around disappointing.<//Review>

Was a bit disappointed this time. The fries were VASTLY undercooked, the burger patties were kinda old and per their procedure, re-nuked. They forgot the other half of our order of mozzarella sticks, the girl actually got saucy with us about it, pun intended, and they refused to give us our receipt!
That's what I get for trying to save a few $ and going out to get it myself...sadly, the deliveries were usually hot, fresh and correct! 😔
But bad days happen; it's not the end of the World, it's just my birthday, teehee. C'est la vie. ✌️🤟✨<//Text>

<text>Person on drive thru didn't pay attention to what I was ordering I told them "2 mix & match for $5, both w/whopper & chicken sandwich." First they asked you want 1? I told them, 2. Then they said 1 w/2 chicken sandwiches, 2 w/whoppers. I told them yes cuz I was getting annoyed. Is it same either way? Yes, but pay attention from the get go.< /text>< Response>

One if the last place to eat at. Service isn't even good. Food isn't close to warm. The people in the back who try to act like they know what they're doing. Managers unprepared to operate the business. Can't even order cup carriers to carry drinks in then have you go back because they got the order way wrong.  BEWARE OF THIS PLACE.</Text>

Food was fast and accurate. Michelle was a bit abrasive at first but was nicer towards the end of our interaction. She made sure our order was correct (good thing cause it wasnt) and was overall a good manager.<//Text>

The worst experience I have ever had.
I ordered my food and when I got to the window I told them that I had a coupon. The guy looks down and shakes his head in frustration. He then starts complaining and yelling about how i should have told him when i ordered. He goes on a rant for a couple of minutes as if i knew that was what i was supposed to do. Horrible service.< /Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>They closed unexpectedly at 7. I had an online order to pick up through drive thru that I ordered at 6:59. The drive thru was closed off so I went to the front door only to see it was locked. I looked at the time and it said they were opened till 11. I saw there were 2 employees in there. One at the counter and one at the food service station making something. I  called them to see if they were still opened and how can I cancel my online order in the app since there is no option. No one responded or even cared that we were out there till 15 mins later. That was when they signaled that they were closed.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809adbb8e2b84079:0x75b0a05ebcadfe13<//gmapID></record>

< review>
Yesterday Monday Oct. 12 at 4 pm. I took my daughter to go try the new pretzel burger!

As soon as we placed the order the women sounded angry!

My child ordered a choclate shake, and a pretzel 🍔!

When we got to the window I said can we please have some ketchup?

The heavy set white women then says super rude!

The burger already has some on it! But whatever! Then shuts the window and leaves us waiting on the shake!  So nasty! We will never be back to this location!<//review>

Very slow and dirty. I got the 2 for 6. For one of my item, I chose the crisp chicken sandwich. It came out very bad, it seemed to be past it's due date. Carl's jr spicy chicken sandwich would have been a much better choice. HIGHLY recommend taking your business else where!</review>

<review>The classic Whopper and a crispy chicken sandwich were a nice deal at 2 for $6. I don't want to admit I like the $1 taco but I can't guarantee I won't buy it again. I'm just not sure what the filling is. I had a longer wait than I would have liked and since there are 3 other restaurants in eyeshot of BK it kinda bothered me. The chicken sandwich more than made up for it. I'll go again because a $3 burger is appropriate for all the fresh veggies. I can't get enough of those tomatoes!!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Friendliest place for fast and delish sustenance. The evening shift and the young lady at the drive through displayed a significant measure of profound consideration and patience, as I had fumbled for some coupons (admittedly), and even smiled as genuinely as the sun will rise. Basically,  people like this deserve leadership roles and should be training the industry.  Much appreciated BK. I know someone who could power wash that parking lot for you in the longrun.. just a suggestion. Cheers< /Review>

First time I came here they lost my mobile order and it still took forever for my order. The next visit I waited over 15 minutes to order and I still ended up leaving before having my order taken. Not even a single person bothered to say it'll be a wait. Last I'll be here.<//Review>

<Text>This is one of the worst if not the worst Burger King I have ever been to. The staff is terrible at serving the customers and don't know what they are doing. There is a reason why there is close to zero customers in the building. Do yourself a favor and look for another BK if you're craving for some burgers.< /Text>< pics>

I drove through the drive thru, got to the window, I noticed on my receipt it didn't have my custom order for my Whoppers. I wanted one plain and the other with no tomato. The young girl argued with me that that's not how I ordered it, I advised yes, I did. She said, with attitude, we'll fix it but you'll have to pull to a spot. I pulled into a parking space and began to fill out the survey, but I wasn't given the correct receipt. The young lady brought our food to us, I asked if there was a different receipt that had the survey code on it. She said, with attitude, you're holding the receipt. I asked for her manager's name, she said she didn't know it, but I could come in and talk to her if I wanted. I asked what her name was and she said that she has other customers that she has to go help as she was walking away. When I got home, my order was still incorrect and I tried to call the store three times, without an answer.<//Review>

The food was soggy, luke-warm, and obviously [deduced but not verified] not fresh. As for the staff: a staff infection would have probably been better suited for the job than the curmudgeons they have working behind the counters here. All-in-all a very disappointing experience.<//text>

The texting app is great. The food is inconsistent. When you pay for cheese on a whopper you should get it.</text>

I would rate this store at a minus 3 over a two month period ether the homeless are hanging out and sleeping on the tables or you are not able to place your order in a timely manner over 4 minutes when they are not busy and then they take 15 minutes to receive your meal or like today they were under stafed because the manager decided to get her nails done at rush time (lunch) and  the tables and floor are dirty I eat at BK because I like the food better than others I will not return to this store good luck the manager got indignant when I got on to her and threatened to call the police<//Text>

<time>1494613604605< /time><response>None< /response><Review>This was the very first time I've been here personally.
I went through the drive through.

I ordered two double Whoppers and some chicken fries since I've never had those.

Nothing special or bad about the chicken.
I could take em or leave them.
Kinda pricy.

The low rating is because of the terrible meat. The patties were very dry, and didn't tase fresh at all.
Adding insult to injury, the total for the aformentioned, was around 16 bucks. !!
I don't have a problem paying more
For a good burger, but these were gross.
This was the very worst bk I've ever been to.

I couldn't back track to return them​ since my schedule was tight.

We crumbled the meat up later and fed my dog.< /Review><user_id>117303458479207691626<//user_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8_EhSn_hHgkNPcsYhW2So-8xGX3sKADwIChQ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><username>crow< /username>< rating>

Whoppers and fries were good, service not so good. I was asked if I wanted a small medium or large I asked is that a junior Whopper or a regular Whopper on the small order then the server called for the manager then the manager started speaking Spanish to me I replied in Spanish back and ask the same question about the order. I was speaking English the whole time before the manager came to me and spoke Spanish. Why would he speak Spanish to me when he heard me speaking English? I would have given a 5 start if the service wasn't rude.< /text>

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not to upset that they weren't open in time, for Wutever reason, but the complete rudeness and disrespect from the manager is wut prompted me to leave this review... This burger king has frequently unprepared, routinely closes early, and opens late. But today, I was at this burger king, around 5:50am, the door sign and online said they open at 530, I went through the drive through no one responded, so I knocked on the front door, the manager (young nerdy, flamboyant looking African American man, with glasses) opened and said "wut do u want?" I asked him what time do u guys open (as it was after 5:50) he replied "our hours are on the door." I pointed out it said 530, he replied "well I'm not ready to open" so I asked when/how long will that be, As he was already closing the door Which he replied "I'll open when I'm ready to open" and closed the door and walked away....<//Review>

I would not recommend to deliver from this Burger King me and my brother were working on a project for school we want to order some lunch from this Burger King we ordered two of the extra long a chicken sandwich large combo and we told him to bring it to our apartment and brung fries and a cold soggy chicken sandwich the only thing I did appreciate from my order that I spent $21.04 gross meal me and my brother didn't even finish the sandwiches the only thing I did appreciate from this whole situation was they bring me a bottle of coke not that water downed cup so I recommend if you are craving Burger King because we all love bird in those charbroiled burgers please try to find good servers that actually care about their job thank you</Text>

1st visit: The service was very slow. I ordered on mobile, and they lost my order, so it took a long time to fix the situation.

2nd visit: I waited at the counter for 15 minutes, recieved no service, so I walked out.< /text>

<time>1513467210928</time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I keep trying to give this place a chance, but wow. Today, they “were out of receipts”. I had to ask the cashier to show me the screen so I could see how I was paying $6 for a Whopper with NO MEAT. The man after me ordered, paid, walked away perplexed and then came back to the cashier. “All the signs say 2 Whoppers for $6. I paid $10” The cashier said, “You have to ask for it.”

I still paid that much for one, btw, that has no MEAT. Vegetarians get a raw deal.

Last time I came here, it was about 7pm, dark. As soon as my daughter and I parked and got out of the car, and a man in the parking lot started acting crazy and screaming. We quickly went to the door and found it locked. A man inside opened it and said, “Sorry, we’re cleaning.” I pointed out the guy screaming - not like I needed to, but he shrugged and shut the door. We ran to the car, then the crazy guy started laughing and chanting that he scared us.  I was so pissed I got in the drive through line and asked for the manager who said, “I can close and lock the place for cleaning whenever I want to.”

I am stupid to have come here after that incident, but now that I remember, I can warn you!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Both of my mother and father in their late 80's were making their plan go to this Burger King just after, 11:00AM Monday January 11Th. I had told my mom, to special order 2 burgers to grill it on prime time for fresh and much better taste. Because of larger surplus of burgers that sitting under the hear lamp during very low customers flow. My mom had ordered for special grill it, fresh. Instead of no, but cashier had enored my mom's request; "NO-CHOICE!" at this location. So, they had ended up to get burgers from the heat lamp instead, "GROSS!" and nasty texture that sit under the heat lamp for several minutes before it's served. No value to their paying customers. Even at McDonald's will give a choice and at the Jack in the Box, they do not grill it until your order is completed. Public; you'll have your choices.</text>

<Review>Stopped by to pick up some milkshakes. The strawberry one was fine but the girl added only a couple of squirts of chocolate syrup to the chocolate one and when I complained,she gave me a lot of attitude. The lady at the drive thru had her fix it. But won't be going there again.</Review>< Pictures>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This is the worst fast food restaurant I’ve ever been to. I live close by so I’ve been here a couple times and if you’re lucky enough to get someone even remotely nice at the counter, it still takes 15 minutes , no lie, to get an order for two people. You can listen to the workers argue in the back. One time they didn’t have cheese. They didn’t say anything either and just put noerella on the burgers. Thu place is horrible. I now avoid it like the plague.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809adbb8e2b84079:0x75b0a05ebcadfe13< /GmapID></record>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Worst burger king ive ever been too. Stopped in with my wife on the way to great grandmas and thought we would get some burgers to take for the grandma and cousins on august 24th at 5:32 pm .... We did order a lot of food $34 to be exact so naturally i knew we were going to have to wait for our to go order .... It took about 20 mins plus they were getting busy so it was understandable. We finally get our food and the lady asks us which sauce we want for our chicken fingers (my wife and i planned to eat in the car on the way) ... We get in the car already cruising down watt and wife cant find the chicken fingers. We finally get to grandmas and unpack all the small bags from the large to go shopping bag they gave us.... No chicken fingers and missing my 2 bacon cheeseburgers and all the fries were barely cooked in the fryer like soggy and gross all 7 orders of fries. We are at grandmas at this point and im hangry and now we have a lack of food and cold to boot. I called and the girl on the phone said nope we dont have your chicken fries or other burgers. We can take your name or something.... Yeah ok whatever.... Im never giving burger king my money ever again<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

What kind of fast food restaurant says they’re not taking any orders right now and turns their customers away? This Burger King in Arden and Watt. Disrespectful manager, store was a mess when I went in, I’d steer clear away from this disgusting place.<//review>

Afican American female manager was very unprofessional. I witness her yelling at 2 Hispanic workers more than one. She said things like dnt give me attitude rollin your eyes i will write you up etc etc. And were blamed them for not noing something was out of stock. She yelled im not putting up with this today while takin orders in the drive thru. The poor woman were scared and i felt so sorry for them. I never once observed then doing anything but working. Overall if you have a problem with employees you should handle in a more professional way. She needs a crash course in integrity and customer survice!<//Text>

Service was friendly, albeit slow for an empty dining area, but the food was hot and pretty standard for BK. I'd return if I was in the area.< /review>

<Text>It Was 10:30pm I'm sure everyone was tired
In this establishment at the time however my experience with this establishment wasnt the best... i ordered a strawberry milkshake  a number 3 large soda and onion rings however i only received a burger with half a patty and fries with a soda
Didn't bother turning around cause i'm sure they were all beat from work today and i believed they were gonna close so its ok

Terrible service, dirty tables, rude customers playing raunchy music full of profanity with my small children within ear shot. Asked the guy if he could turn the volume down please and instead he turned it up and put the song on repeat. Management didn't care and was fine with the ghetto environment. Won't be back.<//Review>

Slowest drive thru ever. After 12 minutes I moved up two spots, and I'm still 4 cars back from the window. Line moves up one space and the next two cars up just fly past the window tired of waiting. Total crap show here.< /Review>
