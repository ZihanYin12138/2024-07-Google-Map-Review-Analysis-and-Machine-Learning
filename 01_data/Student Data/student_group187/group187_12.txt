Great atmosphere and group of people. One of my favorite bars in PB. They also have incredible steak tip baguettes.</text>

I've never felt more welcome and at home at this bar. I look forward to coming back. This will be my small town hometown bar as long as I preside in San Diego.

*One type of advice is adding a jukebox so we customers have options for music rather than one playlist (or a country DJ *wink wink* *hint hint* lol). If there's 2 things I like more than most, it's my beer ice cold and good music while I drink*

Great Steak Baguette. My only complaint was that it was a bit over salted. The bread was delicious, and the steak was well cooked. The service was great and really quick, with very safe and limited contact!<//text>

This is a awesome little bar. Yeah the stools ain't the greatest and stuff is a bit outdated, but it has history behind it. The food and service is why it's 5 stars. Everything I see leaving the window looks amazing. My salad was so good! The dressing on the Asian salad was dank! Tara  took great care of us and was very knowledgeable about the menu, and delivered great service.  This place has pool tables too!< /Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Drove up from Long Beach to try this place. When me and my family first arrived there was no parking and it almost deterred us, then I saw the long line and said we are going there find parking and go because if it has a line it must be good or at least a try. Well it was good very worth the try. The staff and atmosphere was very nice. A little pricey though but somewhere you go once or twice a year or take friends and family who want to try new positive places.</Review>< time>

Highly recommend this place! I'm not really much of a hot dogs type of gal, but they changed my mind on it. They are delicious, price point is great, and great quality! I had the Dirty Chili Dog that I enjoyed although the garlic fries that I had were good. But for my personal taste they didn't do too much for my taste buds. I tried some of my boyfriend's fries, he had the house fries and those were delicious including the sauce!<//review>

Nice local bar atmosphere. Great prices. And the kitchen is amazing. One of the best restaurants in PB. Note that the food takes a bit because it's made fresh by one cook. And they don't serve liquor.</review>

My wife and I sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Evy. She was friendly and attentive our entire stay. They have a great selection of draft beer! I was stoked to see Coronado Blonde on draft. I had the Steak Bites, which were awesome and my wife had the Oriental Salad, which she loved. She would recommend you get the dressing on the side though. The vinaigrette on the salad  is delicious, but can pool at the bottom of the dish, so best to get it on the side. There were a few other people at the bar and the manager (Angela I believe was her name) was out on the floor talking it up with the customers. She stopped by and asked us how everything was. She also told us about some of the new beers they just got in and some of the promotions they do. We are definitely excited to go back and try some more menu items and new beers!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Called in for my Oriental chicken salad.  A favorite of mine for decades.  The service was friendly and quick but when I got ho e to eat my salad, I was disappointed the dressing tasted like vinegar.  I hope it was just a mess up. Please do not change the recipe for the dressing.<//review>< response>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Absolutely not what Cass used to be. New ownership has added some gimmicky punch drink that comes in a Kool-Aid pitcher. I prefer the pitcher of mimosas that came in a plain plastic water pitcher for $15, and the huevos rancheros that we would get from the walk up window. Change is inevitable, I get that. Food and drink didnt need to be changed here, it needed a clean up inside. Instead the new owners painted OVER all the old stuff without even fixing things, covered holes with pieces of wood or drywall and painted that instead, and called it a day. ATTENTION: those of us that have been in town for 20+ years see the fake fixes. It's still run down and needs work!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1583607130670</date>< UserId.>

Local bar but not the same as it used to be.
They dismissed the great doorman that set the mood and friendliness of the place. Food isn't as good and they removed the sharks and other stuff from the walls. It lost its local fun and ambience.< /Text>

This place is the ghost of what Cass Street B&G was before. Very strange vibes. The place is empty. Hardly any place to sit and enjoy a beer in company. I'd rather walk 1 more minute and find a better place in Garnet.<//text>

By far my favorite dive bar in PB. It's got the total locals only feel, which makes it rare amongst other trendy PB bars. Awesome food and bar games available  (pool, darts and shuffleboard). This place is truly an institution.</text>

Cioppino and Oriental Fish salad are our favorites. Burgers rock. Great chili. It's all good. We always see someone we know here. Locals place for sure, but a great place to send tourists. "Eat where the locals do." Cass Street for sure. Hi Kevin!</Text>

Great food, pool tables, and chill atmosphere. Doesn't have hard alcohol though if that's what your looking for.</review>

<Review>The food here is AMAZING!  I came in here thinking I would grab a quick drink but was very surprised to see the line of people waiting to order.  I decided to see what it was all about and ordered a steak sandwich.  SOOOO GOOD!  Will definitely be coming back!< /Review>< pictures>

Cass Street has a great atmosphere with different taxidermy big catch fish around. The ceiling is painted a huge map of mexico fishing shops. They have shuffleboard and a couple pool tables and overall provide a nice open air place for locals to grab a beer and some food. Good beer selection and fair prices. I live in the area and swing by here for a mellow pregame with pitchers before going out.<//Review>

We've been coming to Cass St. Bar & Grill for years, and it's always been a casual bar (nothing fancy), but had great food (fresh fish, etc) for reasonable prices. However, the prices keep going up, and now they are at the point we expect a lot more for the price. The food isn't quite as good as it use to be, it cost more than it should ($12-13 for a salad), and there seemed to be a lot of confusion between the workers on how to pay. The stools are completely worn out (terribly torn & wobly), some tables are very sloped (to the point that another customers beer slid off onto the floor while the guy was up placing his order). Not sure what's going on, but they need to  sink a little money back into the place and get it back to the way it use to be.< /Text>

Burger was good but the lettuce was one piece of yellow iceberg, pretty weak, it also came with no side, which is sad for a $10 burger. They were out of cheese for the dishes that my parents ordered, but didn't tell them when they ordered. Fish was over cooked. The oriental chicken salad was good. The people working were very unorganized, we were standing around with other people to pay because the lady didn't know what she was doing. Stools are thrashed and floors are only partially done. Have been here before and it has definitely gone down in quality. Very over priced for what you get. Will not be coming here again.</text>

While you won't find any liquor at this beer and wine bar, you can get your fix of classic bar eats and a game of pool or darts, before heading on down to all the action on Garnet.
My personal choice: a chicken baguette with some extra of their delicious honey mustard, bacon cheesy potatoes, and a sculpin.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Cass St is where you can find good beer for reasonable prices, regulars who are always up for a game of pool, shuffleboard (but it gets crowded) and GREAT bar food. I highly recommend the cioppino and chicken baguette for lunch or dinner. Cass has my favorite cioppino in San Diego and for a much better price than other places! The main fish will vary based on their fish of the day (check the board) but comes with shrimp, muscles and clams. It's also worth getting the extra garlic bread!

They also have a great and diverse breakfast menu. I've been known to split the burrito between two meals! Don't forget a pitcher of mimosas which contains two, yes two, bottles of champagne!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The teryaki steak sandwich is bomb too, but they've never had fries.  They have Burgers, chicken sands, and other sandwiches, but they have NO FRIES!  They have these cube potato things that you would only order if you were at another restaurant and had ordered an omelet, and they happen to be out of hashed browns so you got stuck with the cubes with bad cheese melted on it.  I need some crunchy onion rings or fries with my burger and beer, sorry.  Who on this lovely earth do you know that doesn't love french fries? All you need is a frier, easiest thing to make at any restaurant.  Anyways, the only other bad thing about this place is the way they store their pint glasses in the ice water germ infested little sink thing below the taps.  The bartender handles all this cash and change in her hands, and sticks her dirty fingers in "the pint glass pool" only to pull the pints out with her fingers INSIDE the glass AND around the rim where my lips are about to go!  I always have to wipe the rims because I am not about to put my lips on that, we all know how much an average bartender handles money and regular duties.  My lips and mouth don't want anything to do with dirty money fingers.  And I wouldn't have blown them up on here if they would have let me email them, but they do not have an email address.  Still a fun place to hang out at and shoot pool with some beers, maybe I'll just order bottled beers from now on..</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Store is closing. Company going out of business. All stores will be closing soon. Right now everything is 20% to 50% off lowest ticketed prices. Most of the store is already picked over. Limited selection. Deals aren't super great and you might not find what you're looking for. I was almost tempted to buy a couple things, but ended up walking out empty handed. Good luck shopping.< /review>

I used to look forward to going to OSH in Antelope every summer just to see what their new summer products were. Slowly I stopped going as their customer service seemed to disappear. I was there tonight and ran in to get my nephew his favorite Charleston Chews and saw 2 starfish decorations I also wanted to buy. I asked for help in trying to find a third one as I had my autism son, a sick dog and I had just had heart surgery last Friday and let the clerk know this. Everyone was on break. It seems every time I have gone every one is on break. Last time no one could help me find Alfalfa Meal after hunting for a half hour.The sales person didn't even know what it was! I finally gave up and left. Now I only go to get my nephew's favorite candy but I think I will just start buying it by the case and on line. It is too frustrating to see something you like and can't get any help in finding if they have "one more." It's become my "why bother store."< /Review>

nice people but their prices are just ridiculous. no wonder they are going out of business. they are a big corporation owned by lowes and i dont feel sorry for them. right before they announced the closure they changed all the price tags to at least 40% more and then said they were on clearance for 20-30%. what a scam. they deserve to go out of business for dirty tactics like that. and all the people who say they have great customer service....would you pay twice as much for something just cuz the employees are extra nice? only a moron would.< /Text>

Whenever I need to figure out what I need to finish a project, I come to this store. The departments are always clean, organized and inviting. I feel I can ask anyone with the green shirt and they have an expert in every department ..sometimes more than one that ask me questio ns to help me get exsctly what I need. They don't run from you, they calmly come to you and help. Thank you OSH. S.D. okie< /text>

It's a nice little hardware store for the area seems to be a bit overpriced and they don't always have what you want but they do offer other services that the other larger hardware stores do not screening measuring those type of things<//Text>

<Review>The Good: I am so happy that I joined SDRC last year. The monthly dues for membership and coaching are reasonable, you have 24/7 access to the boat house unless there's a special event, Coach Sean is really knowledgeable and helpful, and I've met a lot of awesome people here. Mid-weight racing sculls are often in use, so it's good that they allow you to reserve boats for free in advance. As a member, you'll also be able to attend their extravagant galas and informational seminars.

The Bad: I have had a few unpleasant encounters with grouches who almost put me off of joining SDRC, but I would say that the majority of members are friendly.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLh9cz-v6_lQPFKaQ5263oLSXNEq-SzrW0nJn8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Text>This is the go-to spot in San Diego for all things rowing. The summertime has Mission Bay getting pretty crowded, so very early mornings are definitely the best.

If you want to learn rowing, this is definitely the place that you want to do it at. Very good coaching, and a lot of knowledge around the whole place.< /Text>< Name>

Nice secluded spot you can find a spot to park and kick it at a beach. Getting pretty crowded everywhere else these days.< /Review>

I love spice, and I love chicken so whenever I see a place that has spicy chicken I'm going to try it. I ordered the chicken sandwich and fried pickles. Since I was headed to work I only got the extra hot. For sure next time I'll order Get Clucked.

The sandwich was juicy and delicious. For me extra hot was mild, but I have a high tolerance for heat. I think the sauce would be great on fries. I can't wait to try Get Clucked. The portion of fried pickles was enough to satisfy two people. They are definitely worth the money. This place is on my list of favorites for spicy chicken.

Dine in still isn't allowed yet, but there's plenty of tables outside. The place is clean, and all COVID protocols are followed. I think some spicy chicken would be perfect to take on a flight. It would drive the other passengers nuts<//Text>

This place is the epitome of human evolution.

I come here about twice a week and the food has always exceeded my expectations. Regardless if you like spicy food or not there is a heat level for everyone. My wife loves their country fried, while I am addicted to the extra hot.

Their portion sizes are huge as well. I still remember my first time here. I was absolutely speechless and had to sleep in my car for 30 minutes in the parking lot because the size of the sandwich knocked me out. Yes, It's huge.

As far as the sides go my favorites are the Corn Fritters and the Mac and Cheese. Their fries are of the curly kind but slightly on the salty side. Also, most of their sides are big enough to be shared, unless you are like me and vaporize a whole box by yourself.

Their cocktails are delicious too. You might be reserved ordering them since you do have to drive home after but I can assure you, after that size of a meal you could jug 8 of them and barely feel it.

Don't walk, run over here and get their food. Just don't do it when I am there, to keep the line short.< /Review>

Only advise would be on the breading, it is heavy, could get really greasy, bottom bun soaks up and sandwich ends up a chicken salad with soggy croutons. Overall 4/5 great staff, good food, would recommend.< /review><Rate>4<//Rate><user_name>Man-E Cortez<//user_name><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaz-ijbr2ZMKXGWB530QB2e3JmkfHf5H01RH-h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

The tenders were good. Nice and spicy.

But, the Mac and Cheese? I felt that my grandmother had risen from the grave to prepare this side dish just for me.

I highly recommend.</review>

My husband has the “Get Clucked” and it was a perfect heat challenge with just as much flavor. It even made him tear up 🥵 🔥 🤩  I had the “Extra Hot” which was still pretty fiery but soooo damn good. All the food was fresh, juicy and HOT!!! We’ll definitely be recommending this place and coming back as often as possible.</text>< pics>

<review>Hands down the best chicken strips I have ever tried! Nothing comes close..we ordered three of the best chicken strips from the area and did a blind test to see which one wins.

Nashville hot chicken, yes it is. I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich with spice level of hot and loved it. It was hot but tolerable for me and it tasted REALLY good. If youre not eating spicy food regularly, I would recommend going down to medium. The comeback sauce is their version of a thousand island. Their ranch is made with dill and is a classic condiment for all. Looks like its first come, first serve.  When they run out, theyre out. Can't wait to go back for more and suggest you give them a try.</Review>

<Text>My wife and I ordered takeout at Cluck for our two-year anniversary. Yep, it's that good, and yes, it was her idea. I think we've been here almost every week since this place has opened, seriously, it's that good. Staff is always friendly and there's plenty of outdoor seating!

MUST TRY:
- Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich: I mean, how could you NOT get this? We personally go with spicy level 2 which brings just the right amount of heat.
- Nashville Hot Chicken Wings: These are the absolute BEST wings I've ever laid hands on. They're PACKED with flavor; it's a perfect mixture of crispy, sweet, spicy, juicy - and all of it just melts in your mouth, y'all.
- Street Corn Fritters: One of the more unique sides on the menu; it's the perfect complement to the wings.
- Fried Pickles: This is just too good not to get. We usually try to order one side but we always end up getting both this and the corn fritters. And we always have leftovers because the portions here are way too generous.</Text>< name>

The food is good, but you can't customize anything. Also, no options to order ahead and they form lines inside the store. Pretty unforgivable for COVID. I can't tell you how many times I've wanted spicy chicken but passed because of this.</Text>

The spice here is no joke! I had the HOT and it was already bringing heat. Friends and family tried the EXTRA HOT and everyone who’s tried it said it burns. Tears were shed:)

The wings are also fantastic. Lots of flavor. You can tell they brined it well. Would definitely recommend.</text>

One of the best fried chicken sandos in town! If you have had cluck and blaze, this is just as good. The chicken is juicy and the spices are great. If you are a fan of spicy, I would reccomend getting extra hot. Hot wasn't cutting it for me, I like mines super spicy !</Review>

<review>Believe the guy when he tells you the mild is hot. Curly fries, which I don't normally love, but the flavor on these were amazing! Got the Nashville hot, and besides the hot, I wasn't thrilled with the other flavors (sauces, pickles, greens). Skip the cole slaw.<//review>< pictures>

I got medium and it thought it wasn't that bad; could have gone for one level higher. They have an assortment of sauces that will complements the sandwiches.

The chicken at Cluck Kitchen is good, and their 'Hot' heat level was just right for a person with average heat tolerance. My only criticism here is that while Howlin Rays has somehow found a way to hedge against it, I found with Cluck Kitchen chicken that with one bite the fried breading would come off of the rest of the piece of chicken, so I ended up having a mix of uncoated chicken and then just hot fried breading. Again not sure how some others avoid that.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Finally! Hot Chicken is back in the OC! Located near the SNA airport, this place serves bomb hot chicken and amazing sides. Most fried chicken joints do not have notable sides but Cluck takes their sides to the next level, I think I would even go here for the sides alone.

Warning for avid food lovers. Portion sizes are huge! I wanted to order a variety off the menu but it was a huge struggle to finish everything. Sauce portions are also huge. I would always run out of sauce when I get fried chicken but I had ample left after my meal.

I got the wings, tenders, sandwich, and fritters and pickle sides. All the chicken was super juicy and full of flavor. The skin is crispy and not overly bready. I'm also not sure what kind of chicken this place uses but the wings here are huge! They're about 2x the size of other chicken wings and I thought it might have been a turkey-chicken hybrid. Still tastes like bomb chicken though. But the sides are what really make this place. The corn fritters are almost like corn bread puffs and they are full of southern spices and bits of corn. This was bomb. I can imagine people coming here just to eat the fritters. Normally I don't like fried pickles but the frying took away some of the sourness of normal pickles. They taste almost like fried chicken coins with a bit of tang. Everything here was good!

There are five levels of spiciness and you can get mild or medium if you can't handle the heat. I went with Hot for all my orders and although I could taste the spice, I wasn't dieing or drenched in sweat. Would definitely go for the next level of Extra Hot next time.

Tip: I would recommend eating the chicken fresh or as soon as you can after you pick up your order. I took it home afterwards and let it sit for a while. Some of the chicken got soggy, especially the Tenders. Still good, but prolly would have been better if I didn't let it sit.< /review>

< review>
Really excellent! Our large group got some of almost everything (Nashville, Havarti, and regular chicken sandwiches, chicken fingers, fried pickles, corn fritters). Everyone loved their food. And the Nashville Hot sandwiches are really hot! I'm someone who likes spicy Thai food (the real spicy, not Americanized spicy) and was good with level 2-3. My teenager had to take a break in the middle of her level 1 Nashville. And the flavor on those is SOO good.

There are also quite a wide range of different sauces. I think we tried three; one with the pickles, one with the corn fritters and one with the chicken fingers. All were really special. Ryan Yi, who started this place, is a real gourmet and it shows. Oh, and as other reviews have noted the chicken is really excellent -- moist and juicy, and the fry is really excellent. I'm normally not a huge fan of fried chicken but loved it.</review>

I was giving them a second chance. But they failed, again.
It's definitely their first job and first time to be in the F&B business. I asked to add tomato/sundried tomatoes on my sandwich and said: NO
1st person: IT DOSENT TASTE GOOD
2nd person: IT'S RESERVED FOR OUR OTHER SANDWICHES

THEY NEED TO LEARN A LOT. I'LL NEVER BE THERE AGAIN.
It's a 9$ chicken sandwich place not a french cousin.< /text><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Wings are HUGE, fatty, and chewy = hormones. If they served hormone free chicken I think it would be a great place to return to. I just couldn’t  eat my food because of the obvious.< /review><time>1598497861670<//time><UserId.>103810985313162428640</UserId.><Rate>2< /Rate>< Pics>

Well, it was good, definitely, however I started to eat “get clucked” hot which is hooooooot, so after 15 min I still can’t feel my mouth 🤩
It is a bit pricey though.
When you order it is not a menu. But you can create your own menu.< /Text>

Got really excited by seeing all the reviews that compared the place with popeyes and howlin ray's(I tried both). Tried their classic cluck and Nashville sandwiches. Chicken is under cooked and chewy. Couldn't taste anything except the chilli powder. Probably my timing is bad. Surprisingly,  their sweet corn fritters are very good.< /Text>

<user_id>111131601602042276706<//user_id><text>Got the extra hot, I'm very heat tolerant but it was touch and go for a few minutes. I got the Nashville hot sandwich, just the right amount of toppings, and the flavor of the sandwich actually makes it through the heat,  and i just wiped my eye, that was a mistake.

update:
chicken strips are awsome too, and they're big strips, got the hot this time, solid strip, fork tender, crispy battering(most places are too soggy in my opinnion), and just enough heat to not have to spend time crying afterwards</text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I would choose this restaurant over Chick-Fil-A any day.

Absolutely a delight. Since going to Nashville I have missed the hot chicken sandwich and this sandwich satisfied that craving. Their spice definitely has some kick and for optimal mouth feel and flavor eat it fresh.

Sandwiches/Meat (that I tried):
Nashville Hot: classic and delicious, on the spicier side but still has all the components I enjoy. Juicy, moist delicious and well cooked. A bit on the pricey side BUT you can tell it is cooked with love and care (the chicken is thick).

Havarti Hen: a unique take on a fried chicken sandwich but in my opinion was too sweet for my taste, I could see this flavor appealing to other people.

Tenders: So much food. This in my opinion is the best deal. The tenders are large and not overtly battered but still have a nice crunch and taste. Tried it with all the sauces I had and it worked with all of them. Forget Chick-fil-A, this is a MUCH better deal and tastes fresher.

Wing: Decent size, decent amount of meat, definitely the order for someone who likes bone-in chicken. Otherwise, I would say the tenders are better.

Based on the mayo I've tried and chicken quality, I expect the original to be nothing short of delicious.

Sides (that I tried):
Fried pickles: crispy and delicious, they don't skimp on the batter or the pickle, the ranch it comes with is also delicious. TIP: if you're not eating it right away, open the box to release the steam so it doesn't get soggy.

Corn Fritters: Super super crisp and fluffy, not too heavy on the palette and good flavor. The mayo included is delicious as well.

Mac & Cheese: The least unique thing in my opinion, but it's perfect for the kids and satisfies the purpose.

Fries: Curly fries that are crispy and curly, not much that's unique but closest resemblance is if the McDonald's French Fry and In-N-Out French fry had a baby.

Sauces (that I tried):
Cluck Sauce: The better of the two custom sauces. It's like ranchy and creamy and flavorful. Can't really put my finger on the exact flavor.
Comeback Sauce: A lesser Cane's sauce in my opinion, much more mayo-y than I would've liked and blander than the Cluck Sauce.

Lastly, price and ambiance. The staff was very friendly and you could tell they enjoyed where they worked. The restaurant itself is well designed and trendy, I can't wait to go eat there when indoor dining opens again. As for the price, I see that there are people who say that it's expensive and yes, it kinda is in comparison to fast-food fast food but for a fast casual restaurant I would say it's on-par/slightly above. BUT this is the restaurant's only location so be cognizant that it is a small business. If you like the food, and find the price in your budget, continue to support.

Will be back.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

I had a great dinner at this Japanese restaurant! I really love the ambiance of this place. It was so cozy and very relaxing. It feels like you’re in Japan. Their staves were also very friendly and accommodating. I really love to come here again and again! Highly recommendable restaurant! Thanks a lot, guys!<//Text>

We love eating out. Last night we  visited this superb restaurant which friends told us about. We enjoyed a delightful time there with first-rate food and  an experienced crew and an impressive  cuisine. We  added this restaurant in our phone list  and we will certainly go again soon. We highly recommend.</text>

Small mom and pop Panda Express style eatery. Several tables, but no table service. The location is in the middle of the block of a very busy street, so it is easy to miss. The food is good and better menu choices than Panda Express. I loved the Shrimp Fried Rice which was excellent. Lots of shrimp. I recommend the place if your in the neighborhood. Parking no problem. Parking lot next door.< /Text>

<text>I go there at least 3 times a week been to many Chinese places around L.A. and believe me the portions here are huge. The flavor never changes which is a big plus for me. Plus they always have a huge variety of choices. The prices are great and people are regulars and people who are going to be or are becoming. Trust me try it out itl be your #1 choice in Chinese. I'm pretty sure itl be a famous east L.A. food place but Chinese in east L.A. ...oh and I'm not saying this because they are really nice that's a plus</text>< Pictures>

Working with Elias & Co. Has been the best experience I have had working for a staffing agency. They have found the best accommodations for me and have never placed me into a job where I would not feel comfortable working in. I will continue working with them.<//Review>

First time ordering from this joint and it was PERFECT. They made it super easy to order over the phone and they had everything ready when I got there. The best part is that everything was nice and hot by the time I got home! We had the ravioli and meat balls, VERY tasty. Will be coming back!😎💯🔥<//review>

The plate itself for the Chicken Parm was to small, meal flows edge to edge, the spaghetti portion could be a bit more. Taste texture flavor top of the line folks.. like Mamma's but without the touch of herbs. The Antipasto was fantastic. After we shared the first serving for 2, I ordered a second bowl for 1. Dressing was balanced perfectly! A must go!< /Text>

Excellent food and dine-in experience. The workers there are very nice and food service is exquisite. The pizzas always taste perfect and are just way the like. The Russian food during Russian week taste authentic and genuine. My personal favorites include the borscht and chicken Kiev. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this restaurant to pizza enthusiasts and Russian lovers.< /review>

< Review>
HAUS OF RAW DOUGH
First of all, notice how the owner doesnt comment on any negative feedback?  Only the 5 star reviews. ? Well that should tell you something right there.  I heard so many wonderful things about this place, I thought I should give them a try.  HUGE MISTAKE!!  I ordered and paid for it online and was there a little after the time suggested I arrive and upon entering, I hear somebody saying, "Oh Shoot!  I forgot to put the garlic bread in the oven..."  No biggie, I wasnt in a hurry.  However when I got home to unwrap my families dinner, I notice the garlic bread was a little raw.  Again...no biggie.  I threw it in the oven and tried to fix it.  But when I opened the pizza and saw more raw dough, I thought "Should have went to my old faithful COSTCO"   "Crust" should be "crispy"  somewhere<//Review>

<review>Are you a world traveler? Have you enjoyed German and Russian food? When you see the name "HAUS of Pizza" you would scoff at the pizza street food you get in Germany. And thinking that you would enjoy authentic Russia food here would never happen!

MARK Your Calendar for the 1st week of each Month!  You will find as we did a wonderful experience that will have you coming back each month for more!

This week, my husband and I enjoyed home cooked dinner straight from Iryna"s(owner)mothers recipe book. Delicious true flavors and the service was great! Did I mention the very surprising price.

Having moved here 3 years ago we had hunted for a decent pizza and on a lark tried Haus of Pizza. Our search was over! Fantastic each and every time!

Wish I could add pics to this review.  See their menu on line and whether you choose Russian,Italian or Pizza you will be delighted.

Thank  you for great food and experience each visit!

Whether you go for take-out or dine-in, you'll be going to love this place. Their pasta options are super yum and definitely shareable. The Baked Spaghetti at $12.70 was my girlfriend's favorite. Mine is the Manicotti. Soooo delicious!!!<//Review>

<Review>I had been coming here for a couple years regularly up until a couple months ago, but stopped when they charged me the entree price for a starter of spaghetti. I complained at the exact moment I was picking up, but they had already charged my card and were not budging on giving me the entree size or a refund. I found it to be petty and in poor taste and won't be going back.< /Review>< GmapID>

This place should be called Haus of bread and dough cause that's about 86% of your pizza. Hopefully with restrictions being lifted and more people spending this place will get to a place where they can offer a better balance of ingredients. I will try it again in 6 months and see. The chicken parm was fantastic.< /Review>

Food was terrible! I called to get a refund and when I asked for a refund they told me no because I ordered online. They also hung up on me. They said they had not received any complaints the night of and would not be refunding my money! As a customer service professional I found this type of reaction so rude and felt this review was necessary. So unfortunate because we were loyal customers. They obviously had a bad night and the food was not editable. The pizza sauce was so bad it almost had a metal taste to it and the fettuccine Alfredo was nothing but garlic and no sauce. It was basically a garlic pasta. Unfortunately I will no be recommending this place in the future. These days businesses are dying and the least you can do as a business is offer good customer service to those who are most loyal your customers.< /text>

It's my favorite pizza place! Whether you are a meat or a veggie-lover, this place has it. For me, pizza is all about the toppings and the sauce! Theirs is generous and loaded with tomatoes, cheese, onions, sausage, and other toppings, and of course crusty! Try this place and see it for yourself.< /text>

This place is a hidden gem! Amazing food, great service, and not too long of a wait when it came to ordering! Even with all the craziness of COVID 19, my husband and I were able to enjoy a date, with amazing rich flavored food, outside on the adorably decorated patio. We got our food in max 15 minutes, it was fresh out of the oven, and you could tell! The pizza was crunchy in all the right places, the cheese stretched a foot, and the garlic bread was buttery and delicious! The waitress came and made sure we had refills of our water, and even brought us ice cream (that we didn't order!) after our meal. I highly recommend this place!!💙< /Review>

First of all, customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. I rarely give 5 stars, 4 stars is standard for good service. 5 is reserved for those places that go above and beyond. Hence the 5 stars.
Manicotti was amazingly great and pizza is YUM. Can't wait for this place to fully open so I can dine in.< /Review>

My favorite place in the area. Subs are simply great. The pictures speak from themselves. My friend had Spaghetti dinner which is huge and comes with soup or salad and garlic bread. We liked it a lot, it is not the typical fancy place, it’s more like home-made. Hidden little gem. The owner and stuff are super friendly.< /review>

<name>Yanely Perez</name><user>106871306597773263936< /user><Text>I want to say that this is one of the best pizza places in the desert. Not only is the staff friendly but very helpful. The pizza here is absolutely delicious and if you're looking for the perfect cheese pulls, this is the place! When I first ate here, I was amazed at how cheesy the pizza was and picturesque when it first makes its way to your table and you pull that first slice. The only thing about this place is that they don't offer smaller sized soft drinks, you have to get this huge cup even though you probably won't finish one cup. Also, the soda is flat as can be. I've come here on several occasions and the soda has always been this way, basically sugar water. You may be better off (those of you who are 21+ years old) to get a beer with your pizza instead.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3qjA8lvX-okD5K-idMIseFUx0mJR1uCkdUnk4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaojo0BhrYYvCRe_CH0fvVGSQ9L4fTvrcsCfTZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><GmapID>0x80dafe735f4c241d:0xa65dd09510a4b323< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I really missed European influences and being to Italy American restaurants don’t compare in terms of pasta and pizza dishes. Just my opinion! This restaurant however excels in all areas other restaurants do not. A real taste and experience of Italy in Palm Desert. The food was great and my pizza was made to my liking. The basil is a must as any Italian will tell you. I love this restaurant and would highly recommend it. I will definitely visit again.< /Review>

We had an Italian Sub, Eggplant Parmesan,  Fettuccine Alfredo, and the best Antipasto Salad. Dinners came with Garlic bread and soups, since we ordered the salad. Prices are great. We will be back and will recommend this place to our friends,  neighbors, and family members.</review>

During difficult times, we are grateful to this business for being open every day. For the last two months of the Covid-19 we have tried everything in their menu. Thanks God! We do not have to cook at home.

Our verdict is the Panzeratti that served on Wednesday and Thursdays is the tastiest food for us. Then we became addicted to their Antipasto salads and we always order it with our meals. Salads are so fresh and delicious.

Absolutely LOVE all the food at Haus of Pizza in Palm Desert. We are recommend this place to our neighbors, family, and friends.< /review>

<Text>I Love Haus of Pizza. Great food at a great price. You really can tell that the cook takes pride in his cooking. The antipasta salad is one of my favorites with their homemade Italian dressing. Also the Russian tacos and borscht all homemade!</Text>< Pics>

Last weekend for our family reunion we ordered Family Lasagna, Family spaghetti that comes  with eight meatballs and half load of Garlic bread and blonde Pizza. Why blonde? Because the Pizza was half cooked and we finished to bake it in the oven at home. The result was great. See the picture.  Now we will order blonde pizzas at this restaurant. Fyi: you may order uncooked lasagna too and surprise your guests by baking it at home ;)</Text>

You've got to try this restaurant.  It's not German but the freshest Italian around.  Flavors on the scale of the high end Italian eateries.  I had the freshest ice tea ever, and an antipasto for one that could easily serve 2.  I ordered Eggplant Parmagian to go and I couldn't wait for dinner. EXCELLENT.  And order extra garlic bread otherwise you'll be fighting over the dripping butter grilled on stove bread.</review>

OMG, those folks are HEROES for being open every day since COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, they supported local nurces at Eisenhower medical center on Bob Hope Dr in Rancho Mirage. As a result, this restaurant became the locals favorite place to eat now. Cannot wait to sit down inside and enjoy a dine-in meal with a cool AC...< /text>

We visit Haus of Pizza a couple of times a month and have never been disappointed. Their pizzas are the best we can find in the desert. The crust is airy and crisp and the rest of the ingredients are well balanced. Great pizza along with great service.......a perfect combination!< /text>

Whenever I'm in the desert, I always stop by at this place. The staff is very kind and attentive. The food is always delicious and consistent. Salads, pasta dishes, pizza are all delicious. Bonus points: pup friendly patio where you can enjoy lunch/dinner with your furry friend during cooler months!< /text>

The pizza is amazing and is a favorite of any pizza lover! I have tried several dishes (all great). My favorite go to dish to take home after a long work day is the meatball sandwich! Delicious! Chicken Parmesan and Lasagna are also two of my favorites. The coldest beer in the desert on tap. And the main reason I continue to go back over and over is Ray and the entire staff! So friendly and outgoing! You’ll love this place< /Text>

<date>1550353683581<//date><review>It's so hard to write a negative review.
But here goes... I've visited this restaurant a number of times since 2009, when it first recommended to me. I've never been very impressed with the place, food, drinks or service.
Reluctantly, I would be convinced to give it another try..."why"???
There are so many really good Italian restaurants in the desert.
So today...I've make my final declaration ... never again.
Poor service, like warm food and excuse me??? ceiling repair being performed right above a family with a small child. What or who would ever imagine that would be appropriate to sit a party directly in the path of falling debris??? Trust me there were ...well...we were the only other customer...so it wasn't like there weren't other options.
Onto the final straw...I glance over to see the waitress doing a side job of buttering garlic bread without gloves on...now mind you, she's been handing out food, removing dirty dishes and handling payments ....all I can say is YIKES... and NO emphatically. I'll wait to eat later, thanks.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

<Text>What a great find! The food is sooo good and I mean it. The best Pizzas in the Coachella Valley  and a very tasty Eggplant Parm. This is the only place that serves Sausages links either in a Sub or with Pasta. Now the 1st week of every month they serve Russian Food: Borscht,  Russian Salad (Olivie), Meat Patties  (Katlets), Dumplings  (Pelmeni) and more. They made our day when we visited Haus of Pizza in Palm Desert.<//Text><userid>115968325244722654815< /userid>< user_name>

I have been eating pizza here for the last 15 years and averaging 5 x a month at the least.  They have always been consistently good, kept prices reasonable and always ready for pick up in 15 min even during peak times..they have long term staff who work hard and are friendly.  Great pizza at a great price.  Other 2 good places are over priced..especially Bill's ..known fir their sourdough crust.  Just saying save $5_$6 bucks for just as good pizza at Haus of Pizza..  You will love it!!!< /Text>

Too much cheese not enough sausage.  Pop machine broken.  Pizza was good though and would go back for another try.  Price was reasonable.< /review>

<text>Great Itialan food in Coachella valley. Their prices are so reasonable compare to other places who charges twice more. Their Italian, tuna, meatball sandwiches are the best in the desert.
The restaurant is very welcoming, clean and friendly. Great experience!</text>< resp>

<text>Used to be a very nice restaurant with friendly staff and good food.

However, recently my wife went there to get a go order for the family after work.  She gets home and we open the spaghetti and meatballs for the kid and guess what?  No meatballs... just mostly sauce.  Wow, what a way to really disappoint a kid.  So, I open the ravioli hoping to share that with him and guess what?  an entire container of sauce and 7 tiny ravioli hiding on the bottom of the container.  It wouldn't feed one kid let alone being able to split it.  And for the money this was one expensive appetizer.  You would be much better off with two cans of spaghetti O's.  Well, now someone has to get in the car and go buy some burgers at In-n-Out where we will actually get some food.

Anyway, we don't plan on returning there.  Far too much money to go hungry.<//text><username>Ivan Thomson< /username><user_id>103553384422095535404</user_id>< Time>

Two twin sisters and their extended family run a pizza AND pastaria their grand parents created. Great business and family story combined!!! Customers seem to be all regulars. VERY COMFORTABLE place to slow down. Small place but intimate not crowded.  Not the best Italian to me but I AM SPOILED BY ITALIANS AND EXPERIENCE. TRY EM. I REALLY ENJOY THESE PEOPLE. LUNCH
Too!<//Review>

This place is literally the best pizza place in the entire Coachella Valley. My husband and I eat here too much, if that is even a thing. Everytime we order food it is made in a timely manner, the quality is fantastic, and we are greeted with a smile. HIGHLY recommend a medium pepperoni pizza or the spaghetti and meatballs, or both in one order. In conclusion, eat at this restaurant as many times as humanly possible.</review>

After a recent return visit to Haus of Pizza I was like "wow, that was good, I should write a review!" When I went to write the review  I discovered I had already written one.

The first review was 5 years old.  Over that time, a lot has changed but everything that was good about Haus of Pizza stayed the same or only got better.

2014
We needed to do something quick after finishing play practice at church.  They have great food at an affordable price.  I can recommend the family style antipasto with great options in both pizza and pasta.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dafe735f4c241d:0xa65dd09510a4b323< /Gmap_id><name>Anthony Usera Power of Chiropractic</name>< user>

<Text>I constantly look for a good pizza and have not quite found it yet in the Desert after 35 years of being here.  I have not tried the pizza at the Haus yet because I have thoroughly enjoyed the soup, salad, subs and the “ghetti.”

The minestrone soup was just the right consistency – not watery and not too thick, with just the right proportionate amount of the vegetables.  The salad that came with the soup combo was fresh, with no brown lettuce, and the garlic bread served with the combo is the best – soft, yet crunchy and garlicky.The subs are tasty with generous portions of the meat/cheese.  The “ghetti “sauce was the best ever.  Everything beat my current haunt, Mario's, by 26 miles.  I have back to the Haus 3 times in a week and look forward to the pizza on my soon-to-be next visit.

A refreshing side note and not-to-be-taken lightly, the new owner and her employees were friendly, efficient, and helpful.  On my first visit, the cook even opened the door for me on the way out because my arms were full.  I was extremely impressed.

So, do I like the Haus?  Yes, hell yes.  Will I go back?  You betcha.  Will I take guests and spread the word?  Absolutely.

Continued success to the Haus.</Text>< Pics>

After a recent return visit to Haus of Pizza I was like "wow, that was good, I should write a review!" When I went to write the review  I discovered I had already written one.

The first review was 5 years old.  Over that time, a lot has changed but everything that was good about Haus of Pizza stayed the same or only got better.

2014
We needed to do something quick after finishing play practice at church.  They have great food at an affordable price.  I can recommend the family style antipasto with great options in both pizza and pasta.<//text>

Neither fancy, nor formal, Haus of Pizza is a local favorite for a reason: it puts out some great pizza.

Tucked in a strip mall off Highway 111, it would be easy to miss Haus of Pizza, and that would be a mistake.

The small dining room is nothing to behold: formica toped tables and linoleum floors.  But one does not come to Haus of Pizza for the atmosphere--it's the pizza that's the star.  The pies are neither Neapolitan thin crust, Chicago deep dish, nor New York style; they are medium thickness with good, yeasty dough, quality tomato sauce, and the list of usual suspects for ingredients, but are absolutely delicious.  The signature Haus Special pizza (medium, $15) with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, and sausage is a stand out.

While pizza is the star, Haus has other selections as well.  The generously proportioned chicken Parmesan sandwich (9-inch, $7.65) was hearty and filling.  The spaghetti and meatballs ($7.40) was very good; the sauce had great tomato flavor, and the meatballs were tender enough to cut with a fork.

Wine aficionados will be disappointed, as the selections are quite limited, but beer drinkers will be thrilled with the small (20 ounces) or large (32 ounces) chilled stone mugs and a good variety of beers on tap.

Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  Kara, the hostess, cashier, and waitress makes juggling multiple tables, answering the constantly ringing telephone, and serving patrons at the counter look easy.

All in all, this "hole in the wall" serves fines pizza at very reasonable prices.  haus of Pizza is a must visit, if you are in Palm Desert.< /review>

<Text>I started coming to Verve back in May and I did not know how much I needed this in my life! I took a few spin classes in the past, but always felt intimidated or out of place. The minute I got to Verve, the studio coordinators welcomed me with smiles, helped me set up my bike, and checked in with me after the ride. I thought to myself, they can't possibly be like this every time but they most definitely are! Every person I have met is willing to get to know you and it makes a world of a difference to feel included and confident to try it again.

I love the current mix of indoor/outdoor classes, and the instructors are amazing! They always bring a good time with fun playlists and challenging choreography. =)<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I’ve tried other spin studios and no other places are as spectacular as this one. Lena and every crew member really do their best to make each ride just as fun as the last one. Each instructor has their own flavor so every class is new and exciting. There are no amount of praises that can fully describe how grateful I am to have found this studio at the start of my fitness journey! The crew and even fellow riders really push you to be your best and challenge you to always level up.

Looking for a spin cycling experience? Look no further. Verve is an impressive independent cycling studio with an inspiring sense of community, not one of those soulless corporations. Service, energy, spirit, dedication and enthusiasm of its instructors, especially the owner, are first rate. Equally impressive are Verve’s equipment and facilities, and its ability and willingness to adapt and try new things, particularly during this past year.<//text>

I recently started taking classes here and absolutely love it!  Every employee goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome and part of their community.  The instructors, especially Missy, are so enthusiastic and fun that the classes fly by.  Furthermore,  I always feel that I have gotten a great workout.  I also think that their bikes are fabulous.  I haven’t seen this kind before, but they are easy to use and to adjust for a perfect ride. Everyone needs to give VERVE a try!<//text>

I was introduced to Verve by a friend when Lena first opened, and I have never regretted a single ride ever since. I keep bringing friends and family because I am just so happy to share such an amazing space where you always feel energized and welcome - It is just so rewarding to be part of a local business that kicks your butt to get back in shape, and do it with a smile :) LOVE VERVE !< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I never thought I’d stick to any workout as long as I’ve stuck with VERVE - so there must be something to their exercise madness! From the awesome beats to the fun theme rides and inspirational/motivational words from each instructor during class - it’s like going to the gym, nightclub and a therapy session all in one! It’s also pretty cool that they learn your name quickly and greet you with a big smile when you walk in. One of my favorite quotes that really stuck with me during a class “Everyone in here is with you, they’ve got your back” And it’s true - we’re all in there working out hard, feeling the burn, and you’re not the only one feeling the burn or struggling. It’s nice to feel part of something pretty amazing. :)</review>< pictures>

Love verve so much! The energy from everyone is always so positive and uplifting. I always take Ana Paula’s classes and she will kick your butt with the intense workout but it’s so worth it!!!</text>

I've been to a lot of cycling studios, but none are as welcoming and friendly as VERVE. The owner, Lena, is so passionate about her business and is one of the best instructors I've ever had. She makes cycling so much fun and I never dread coming to class. I also have planned a corporate event here and everyone loved it. It was such a great bonding experience. The studio is always clean and aesthetically pleasing. You NEED to try the VERVE experience. P.s. they have the most comfortable seats on their bikes.</Text>

<review>One of my good friends introduced me to Verve about 2 months ago and I am so grateful she did! I've always loved spin classes but after moving from LA, it was hard for me to find a studio that I felt a good connection with. Verve came along and I think I've found my match! I often times rush to Verve after work and the parking is super easy and convenient. The studio is sparkling clean, the spin shoes are new and comfortable (and free!), the bikes feel like riding on butter and most importantly, the instructors and the team are friendly, energetic, enthusiastic and have great taste in music!  I love that the bikes aren't so close together that I feel like I am riding on top of my neighbor and the room doesn't get so hot that I feel like I am going to pass out. I can confidently ride, close my eyes and focus on myself during class. The motivation of the instructors is super helpful and I always leave feeling much better than when I started. Thank you Verve :)<//review>< Name>

Verve Studios truly is the best spin studio in San Diego. This is the due to the amazing instructors, the studio itself, the bikes and the music and most of all the people who show up and motivate each other to get an amazing workout in. I have tried spin classes at various studios and its not the same.. If you have never tried spin or want to try a new studio I personally guarantee and promise you will have the best time ever. Lena, Shannon, and Missy will give you the best workout and you will be treated to some upbeat music that will keep you going.<//text>

Absolutely love Verve Studios! I have been going to Verve for almost 3 months now and have lost 15+ lbs! The 45 minutes fly by because the music and workouts are every changing. All of the instructors are personable and ensure that each class is an inclusive environment.  I highly recommend trying a local studio. #ridelocal< /Review>

<Review>Love this studio! I have been to just about every spin studio in San Diego but this one is definitely the best. The space is beautiful, the bikes are great and the class experience is amazing regardless of who is teaching. All of the instructors bring it every single time. Lena the owner takes the time to get to know all of the clients, offer fun events and challenges and always has a smile on her face. This studio is really something special.<//Review><rating>5<//rating><name>Jessica Hasselman</name>< UserId.>

I love Verve - Lena, the owner, brings her amazing energy and has instilled it in her fantastic team. I feel so fortunate to have found a local spin studio who cares about its clients. I always feel re-energized after my 45 min sessions.  I can not recommend more highly!</review>

Riding at Verve is unlike any other experience I’ve had before. From my first time at Verve up to now, I have always felt a sense of community and support. The Verve team takes the time to get to know each member and what their goals are. They genuinely care about each riders experience and aim to make every workout one to remember. With live DJ rides, themed classes and Summer games, like Verve for the summer, working out is something I now look forward to !!! So thankful I found my fitness family at Verve ✨<//Text>

I really like this spin studio because the instructors really pump up the energy and lead you through an intense work out. I am an Ironman Triathlete and a 45 min spin at Verve is a great training ride.  They were welcoming and friendly from when I walked in for my first class.< /text>

Fantastic brand new spin studio just off the 5 in Del Mar. The teachers are so high-energy and creative, and the facilities are clean and beautiful. I have always felt welcomed here and so is my mother who kicks butt and takes way more classes than me at age 65! Verve is a great addition to the community.< /review>

The owner is very kind and obviously passionate about the studio. I came here to follow my favorite trainer who recently left another studio and it does not disappoint. I just miss the cold eucalyptus towels at the end of the ride (such a little treat and pick me up after a long ride!). If they could do this it'd be the #1 place I recommend in SD.

New to spin but the entire staff is so helpful getting you setup all the way to clipping in your feet.  Music is unreal!  You can tell that Lena is passionate not only about Verve but about spin in general.  Great standard workout or change of pace.</Text>

I love Verve! This is the first studio I’ve tried that doesn’t have the monitors on the bike to show distance, calories, resistance levels, etc. at first I thought it would be demotivating to not see the stats and I wouldn’t work as hard. It’s the complete opposite. Without the distraction, it’s easy to just get in the groove, listen to your body and work even harder. I love all of the instructors and Lena has done an amazing job with the studio. I feel like a brand new person after each class!< /Review>

I've tried a few different cycling classes throughout SD and none of them ever wowed me so I stuck to bootcamp and running for the past few years. However, when VERVE opened it Del Mar I figured I'd try it out. I was immediately hooked!

From the friendly and helpful staff (I'm notorious for having trouble clipping in and out and they go around before class to make sure you're all set) to the high-energy classes with super motivating instructors, VERVE is now in my regular rotation of weekly workouts. Plus the studio is beautiful and always immaculate.< /review>

The VERVE Studios elevated me out of my rut of a traditional gym goer.  I love the studios atmosphere and I can't say enough fantastic things about the instructors.  I have taken classes taught by Lena, Emily, and KTB; all are amazing.  I can't wait to schedule a class with Shannon and Missy.  All are fantastic, bringing their own unique energy to the classes.  Every opportunity I get to take a class you will see me in the back row spinning to my potential.  Thanks Verve Stuidos.<//review>

<Review>I originally came to VERVE for a group event, but loved it so much that I signed up for a membership! They have a special going on right now for new members that is $100 for unlimited classes for a month, which is a steal. I live in La Jolla and drive up to Del Mar, because of how great the classes are (even though there are multiple spin studios in La Jolla). I have taken classes with all instructions and would take each of them again! Each instructor is different - different choreography and energy - but always a great workout! I would recommend anyone to join their studio - you won’t regret it!<//Review>< Response>

< Review>
Great spot! Defiantly recommend taking one of Shannons classes she has the best energy and creates unique, fantastic playlist for each class; you never know what to expect!! I would recommend going to a 630pm class if you don't live in Del Mar because the traffic can be very heavy due to the congestion of the 5 freeway. Everything in the studio is brand-new and the bikes are great as well. Great spot!</Review>

Lena really cares about her clients and their experience. The studio is clean, bright, and has the most up to date lighting and sound system. The bikes are my favorite in all of San Diego. They have a two system gauge for resistance that provides a smooth and unique ride. This studio is something special. I live in Encinitas but drive past multiple other spin studios to come here. It’s worth it!</text>< Pics>

I cannot say enough great things about Verve!

I am a newbie cyclist and I LOVE it! Before now, I always thought cycle classes would be too intense for me and I was intimidated to try one. I am so glad that Verve changed my mind!

The instructors are extremely welcoming and even know me by name! They do a great job of encouraging you to push yourself and motivate you to keep going throughout the class. I have ridden with KTB, Lena, and Chelsea who are all AMAZING, high energy, and inspiring.

Their playlists are well-planned and keep you pumped up throughout the class. They also do a great job of keeping your upper body in as good of shape as your lower body with an arm workout and upper body choreography.

Even though I cycle at a beginner level, I see people in class who are absolute masters sweating up a storm! The classes are great because you can get as much out of them as you want. You can make it more or less challenging to match your level and intensity of workout.

The best thing about Verve is how much passion the owner has. Lena really has made the studio a special place and I feel truly appreciated every time I go.<//Review>

Click your spin shoes together three times and you’ll find yourself at home here. Verve Studio is more than an indoor spin studio. Yes, you’ll absolutely get an intensely sweaty and motivating workout set to some pretty awesome, make you dance in your saddle playlists here. But you’ll also join a community of people who share a love and passion for healthy living.

There’s an empowering and welcoming energy at Verve that sets it apart from any other fitness studio I’ve been to. Lena and her team of instructors and front desk staff are creating some serious magic here. So whether you’re a new rider, spin junkie, or professional cyclist training for Tour de France, you’ve got to check Verve out. It’s sure to be your new go to fitness haven and home.</review>

This “ride to the beat of the music” spin workout and this studio is IT!!!  Super clean studio, brand-new smooth riding bikes, welcoming to all, positive & engaging instructors, awesome music, fun live DJ rides and collab events, complimentary shoes & towel, lockers not open cubbies, showers, easy to use app for booking classes/bikes, free parking, and locally & female-owned!!  My favorite are the Hip Hop rides!  Newbies should try at least 3 times.  If your considering a new spin studio or spin workout, look no further than Verve Studios in Del Mar!!</Text><Date>1565846593328</Date></record>

<Date>1575935697316< /Date><rating>5</rating><Text>I signed up for a FREE WEEK of spin at VERVE and boy am I sooo glad to find this gem 💎. The studio is located in Del Mar Heights right off the 5 freeway. It’s near a lot of different restaurants and Vons. So if you’re ever hungry after a good spin sess, like I am 😆, you have lots of good options.

Once you walk into the studio, you notice a nice textured wall that has different shades of blue and grey(you’ve probably seen pictures on their yelp reviews). You’re immediately greeted by their friendly front desk staff. They sign you in and offer spin shoes(if you don’t have any). I’m sure there’s a rental fee, but I have my own spin shoes, so I’m not sure how much they charge. But once you’re signed in, you’re given a tour around the studio. I love how clean everything is. They have 2 cute bathrooms and showers(I love the wallpaper in the bathroom). They have nice lockers to keep all your valuables in. When you walk into the spin room there are towels on each bike for you.

Now the instructors here are soooo freakin AWESOME! I’ve taken Anapaula, Lena(studio owner) and Cameron so far. They all have very high energy and are so positive and motivating. Just when you’re feeling tired and need that extra push, they say all the right things to give that extra push. I always left here dripping in sweat and loved every minute of it.

VERVE has a great community of people. Very warm and welcoming. I have really enjoyed my week here and appreciate all the positive vibes from everyone in the studio. I know I’ll definitely be coming back here soon 🤗</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Verve Studios has truly changed my life in every way. I used to be a Division 1 athlete who loved working out and then after graduating college – working out fell to the wayside. I was unmotivated, unhealthy, and not mentally in the right mindset to be the best version of myself. I eventually started going to the gym again, but never found the fire or passion that I used to have for working out until I walked into Verve Studios. The change for me has truly happened within the last month and I can tell you, I’m GLOWING. I feel SO motivated, SO much healthier, and my mindset right now is UNSTOPPABLE. The first time I took a class there I found myself so welcomed and supported that I actually worked out in just a sports bra, which is CRAZY for me! I have so many insecurities about my body, but the most amazing thing about Verve Studios is the support and "no judgement zone," feeling you get when you walk through the doors. You push yourself hard, you push the person next to you harder, and everyone RIDES TOGETHER. I’ve never felt more love and more sense of a community then when I ride at Verve Studios. Plus the founder, Lena Rakijian, is one of the kindest, most passionate souls that I have ever met. She truly hires teachers who are aligned with the company's culture and each time I go in to ride, I come out feeling like a more improved version of myself. I mean, how many workout places can you say that about?? I’ll wait…haha I LOVE YOU VERVE STUDIOS!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1565828038231, 'text': 'Thank you for being part of the VERVE community Kara!

<text>My amazing hair stylists name is Ale and all I can say about my results or should I say transformation is WOW! She really is a talented hair stylist and knows how to work her magic. I went in requesting a balayage with no hopes of getting it to where she got me in one shot. The results were outstanding not to say the condition of my hair was NO damage which I had never experienced. She is extremely honest and underestimates the results but over performs miracles in my experience. I had black boxed hair dye in my hair for many years and never thought I could get these results so quick. I did stop dying my hair black, two years back but there is no way I thought I would get these amazing results! I highly recommend her!<//text>< Pics>

<review>My hairstylist Angeline was amazing as usual ! This is the second time I’ve gone to her and I’m hooked. I love that she pays attention to her clients and she always tries to do what’s best for your hair. It’s been a process cause I messed up my hair myself and we’ve been working together to get it at a level that will not damage my hair ! I’ve gone the cheap route and it ruined me. I’m sticking with her cause she gives good prices and it’s worth is especially since you always has you leaving the salon making sure it’s exactly as you wanted !< /review>< pics>

<Text>This a great, comfortable space— open, clean, and high ceilings.  Everyone is friendly and they make you feel at home.  My wife and go to Ashley but all of the stylists seem like they’re doing great work.  We’ve been going here for years and we’ve never been disappointed.  There are also spa services and other salon services here.  Great place 👍🏼< /Text><Name>Kenneth .Johnson</Name><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFNJmesCNeRNwY9w1wJvH13PF_F0njdhVyqxa3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6WEkyR-WITGq9EepcYBIMFh1EIpZOfSzEH0gS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Love love love my hair! Angelie was recommended to me after growing out my hair for a very long time! I don’t know how she did it but she worked her magic and I’m loving my locks!!! Thank you Angelie, I always wanted hair like this when I was little and now I’ve finally glowed up!!! You are amazing and such a beautiful and positive person! I left sooooo much happy! Thank you a million times!

If you want lovely hair like this go see Angelie!!!< /review>

Everyone here is amazing. Customer service is exceptional, always personable and will not let you leave unless you are happy with the results. Worth the pretty penny when you come out looking like a million 🙌 If your a girl with a lot of thick hair like myself I highly recommend my girl Nicole. She is a professional when it comes to coloring and styling thick hair.< /Review>

I see April for facials. My skin has never looks so good.   I have such a good time it feels like I'm with my best friend for an hour. She makes you comfortable and you leave feeling pampered, refreshed, and glamorous.  Men if you are looking for a gift for you ladies buy her time with April, she is a total WIN!</review>

Love, love, love!  I'm in the process of letting my grey hair come out and play, but I didn't want to just let it root out.  Angie did an amazing job of bleaching/toning and cutting my hair.  Couldn't have had a better experience.< /Review>

(Copied and pasted from my yelp review)
First off, its nearly impossible to book an appointment because their receptionist is pretty much non-existant. I called three times. The first two times there was no answer. The third time I got put on hold for five minutes, then they hung up. When I finally called a fourth time, I got my appointment.

I went to see the stylist Annie, because I had heard good things about her. I gave very specific instructions about what I wanted. Half an hour later, I walked out of there, my hair looking nothing like what I asked for. It got cut way, WAY too short. Now I have to begin the process of growing my hair out anew, and live with a hair cut that is, in my opinion, terrible.</text>

<Text>Drew was my sales person. Nice guy got me in and out fairly quickly. I would recommend this location over an authorized retailer. If you only have access to Authorized Retailers I guess you gotta do what you gotta do but the official stores usually have more employees, stock and "deals".<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxSOVdY6PyiK4FFmoLfVJKDDut9QT6iTeF8M_a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>{'time': 1591208793043, 'text': 'Hello Aaron Cunningham.

<text>Bryan is an absolute wonderful salesperson. He is patience, thoughtful, sincere, and knowledgeable. He informed me of all my different options. I never felt pressured or rushed to make a decision. He answered all my questions thoroughly, crunched numbers for me, and made me feel confidence in my decision. After my purchase, he took the time to ensure the information from my old phone transferred over to my new phone. I walked out the door being satisfied with the great service he provided to me during my visit.

Thank you Bryan for providing such amazing customer service.< /text>< Pictures>

The client service Miguel provided was impeccable from the minute I walked in the door to the second I stepped out of the store. He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. It was apparent that he genuinely cared about giving his clients a very personalized and individualized experience. Helpful is an understatement. He is outstanding at his job. AT&T, you are lucky to have him working for you! If you ever go into the Fullerton AT&T, look for Miguel, believe me, you will not be disappointed.</text>

The Representative Ana was amazing! The customer service at the FULLERTON location is great and every employee in there is very nice and makes you feel welcomed. Thank you both to Ana and the store manager Aaron for being patient, kind and very helpful with all my questions I had and making sure that all my services and phone were up and running before I left. I recommend everyone to go to this AT&T store in Fullerton! Thanks again Ana and Aaron for all your help!!!< /text>

10/10 would recommend the AT&T store in Fullerton. It was very organized and the displays were very eye catching. I was most pleased with the assistance I received from Miguel. His detailed explanations of the various options to upgrade my phone were very helpful. I definitely left with a better phone than I expected to purchase which I’m very pleased with 😊</text>

We came into the store for a few reasons. Gerardo was able to help us with several items. He provided great customer service as does others in this store like Anna. But today Gerado was the one, he is great with helping us and the info. We appreciate him</text>

I came in today to return an Apple Watch only because I didn’t necessarily need it, and I was helped by the manager Aaron. I had ordered the watch online and never opened it. He was incredibly helpful and easy to talk to. He didn’t make me try to keep the watch or anything. He asked general questions and was able to do the return smoothly. It was nice to see more than two people on the floor, and if I ever need help with anything I will definitely be back! Some of the best customer service I’ve experienced! Thank you again!</text>

<review>I recently switched from an Android phone to an iPhone. German assisted me through out the entire process and was very knowledgeable about the phones features. He made the transition very easy for me. He was very kind and charming. I will definitely  be returning to this location in the future to purchase phone accessories and I would recommend anyone to come to this location if you are looking excellent customer service!</review></record></dataset><record>

I upgraded my phone here and Miguel was phenomenal!!! He helped me and my mom both get new phones. He was so patient and kind. If you’re going to get a new phone or have any questions I highly recommend him. Genuine people are unfortunately hard to come by but Miguel was one of them.</review>

Miguel was absolutely amazing. I told him I needed to simplify my mom's phone. She is 80 years old and lives in an assisted living facility which has been locked down for 11 months, so her phone is her lifeline. She gets confused and frustrated with her phone which is very disorganized and too complex for her. Miguel took over an hour helping me upgrade her phone, download her pictures, and transfer her information to her new phone. He simplified the home screen and organized the seven or eight apps that she actually uses in a manner that will make using her phone so much easier for her. All the while,  Miguel was extremely friendly. What a great experience. Thank you for your help and concern Miguel!</Text>

Miguel Mora helped my entire family switch from Verizon to AT&T. As a family we had a plan with Verizon that went back to 1999, because technology is overwhelming we forewent due diligence to shop for the right provider all these years. As a result we were limited with no international plan, we have a lot of family in Mexico and now with AT&T we have the right coverage when we travel to Mexico. Had I known that Miguel at AT&T would make the transition easy I would've switched moons ago. Miguel is certainly best-in-class, I am most grateful for his Spanish as it helped a ton with my elderly parents. Thanks Miguel and AT&T for the top-notch experience.< /Review>

<Review>Just switched to AT&T today and upgraded to the newest iPhone. I was helped out by Jeremie/Rose and received satisfactory customer service from both of them. Jeremie was extremely patient with my family and I and received step-by-step explanations all throughout my transition process. Despite the length of my purchase, Jeremie did a fantastic job in making my experience with this branch a good one! I would highly recommend these two individuals to anyone who is looking for services from this branch.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Javier was extremely rude to me when I came into the store to do a trade in. Since the moment I walked in it seemed if he didn’t to help me at all. I’d ask a question and he would rudely just point at the paper. I used to love this store but this experience didn’t help me coming back.< /Text>

Maria has excellent customer service!  She helped us out so much and even went over our bill with us ! She’s very patient and helped my daughter with her new phone . You need more employees like her . I give her 10 stars ⭐️!!!  Thanks again 😊 Marisol the manager also was so helpful in explaining everything to me and getting me the best deal for my bill .  I appreciate everything they both did .😊 Definitely will refer people to theses two ladies .</review>

Came in to talk about upgrade options for my line and  Jeremy was the rep that helped me. Was super awesome answering all my questions and took the time to make sure I felt comfortable/confident with my choices. He even went above n beyond by looking at our plan details and discovering that my line qualifies for a additional discount I didn't know about. Very happy with the service I received and happy to be a att customer</Text>

<review>I went to this store and was assisted by an ATT rep named Maria. I told her that there was a $35 charge that started appearing on my credit card from ATT that I don’t know about. She went out of her way in calling the ATT billing and through her assistance I was able to find out that someone is using my credit card to pay their account. I was referred to their fraud department for resolution.

Rep. Maria is an asset to ATT and I pray that she will have a fruitful career in customer service.<//review>< pictures>

Maria assisted me immediately and was very kind and willing to answer my questions! We went through options for upgrading my phone and she explained in detail everything I needed to know. I made my decision and just like that, we began the easy process to set up my new phone and begin the transfer of my files. Even when other guests came into the store, Maria introduced me to Chris who made sure I was all set to go before I left. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Friendly, fast, and efficient, AND SAFE! Thank you!< /Review>

<text>German was great. He knows his stuff and he helped my fiancé and I get new phones and on a new plan and was very good about explaining everything step by step. He got us the best deal and took the time to find the best solution for us. If you go to this branch ask for German for sure.< /text></record>

<Text>I am changing my review for this store because of an associate named Anabel. In short, she added features to my plan upon upgrading my phone, that very I specifically asked her not to. Luckily I was able to resolve these issues with online chat support, but I am extremely disappointed with how helpful Anabel appeared to be when she was really being sneaky with my plan rates. I really thought she was giving me great and honest service but no, instead I had to spend my Sunday morning sorting out my bill with online chat support.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

We bought an Internet plus TV bundle and we have told that we will charge $40+$40 (Internet+TV), so combo offer was for $80/month. But once we installed the internet and TV, we charged $50 for Internet every month and when we came to the store, every time they told us different story with different people. We had to back and forth every month for just $10 credit that they were charging extra. I am totally frustrated with the customer support provided by this AT&T store.< /text>

We went to the Fullerton store because my old phone was telling me apps had stop working and my storage was full. Then we had to come back because my new phone didn't work for landlines so I had to get a new Sim card.  The rep then answered all of my questions and was very helpful.< /Review>

Maria helped me today and omg changed my whole opinion about AT&T and believe me it wasn’t a good one. For the last year I have been having problem after problem with my account after purchasing something new at a store every time ! I was promised one thing and my bill delivered another :(  After today, going in to this location ( a corporate location ) Maria explained to me about the “franchise stores” and the frustrating differences that led to my negative opinion regarding AT&T as a whole. She was extremely patient and understanding and more than willing to make any changes to satisfy my wants and expectations for my companies phone plan. Amazing customer service on her end and made what I need to accomplish as fast as possible. I will be going in to this location from now on! Thank you again Maria, you were outstanding today !</review>

I called customer service tech support and was on the phone with them for over an hour 1/2  on Thursday.
They told me I had to go into the store because they couldn’t figure it out.
I drove down to Orange County to visit family and friends and was gonna be here for the week so I called the AT&T store on harbor in Fullerton and Just like that Drew was able  to help me get into my HBO max Account with no problem in less then 5 min I was streaming!
A big thank you to Drew at the AT&T store in
Fullerton CA.<//Review>< GmapID>

I was very impressed with Fernando’s knowledge and attitude.  I was here today to begin switching my account to another service provider but Fernando explained that staying with Att is my best option. He should be commended for his level of service and expertise.  Pete Kang</Text>

I was needing help with my apple phone. I thought it was a issue with my service. I actually needed to do reset and I was nervous to do the restart without loosing all my info. After having the run around with tech support and getting no where, I went into the store a few months back and a manager named Chris was so helpful. He not only took his time helping me with my issue, he also said I could do a follow up with him to make sure I didn’t have any further issues with my phone. Exceptional customer service! Ask for Chris.<//text>

Terrible customer service. Waited in line for 30 minutes only to get passed over twice. Better luck beating LA traffic than getting service.<//Review>

Did not try to help, stated debris in charge port and to go home and try to clean out😠...The supervisor had told him he was next for break or lunch so that was his priority to get us out of store. Was going to ask for someone else but I am sure they work on commission and at that point did not want anyone in that store to profit! I expected to purchase a new phone but will go a different store tomorrow....or maybe will take this opportunity  to switch carriers as AT&T really not customer oriented...too much of a  monopoly and they really don't care about their customerps<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None</resp><Date>1553432587859<//Date><review>This place is always a hit or miss for service. Most of the time the service is abysmal. Last night I came in about 30 minutes before closing. Just needed to buy a new phone. I could see that the store carried the phone I wanted because they had 4 in the store; however, when I asked the guy to bring me a phone he brought me 2 phones that weren't the ones I requested. I understand they wanted to get out of there but not only did they lie they tried to upsell me phones I didn't want or need. The men that work here are horrible. They don't care for their customers nor do they really want to succeed in a sales culture. They lost my business with a phone and I have bought it somewhere else. I will go back to file a complaint with someone above the store manager. Expect me to return for the sole purpose of canceling my service with this horrible company.<//review></record>

The star is for the manager Zoey; she is the only one who might know how to treat a customer in this location. This place should deserve negative stars without her presence. They are providing the worst/terrible customer service ever, making AT&T's customer service look horrible. Poor attitudes, disrespectful, arrogant, unwilling to help...are damaging AT&T's reputation. Nothing wrong with speaking Spanish, but speaking the language that a customer does not understand and laughing after giving an unprofessional and disrespectful service is making me so unconfortable. I felt like I went to their territory and fought for my rights. AT&T should focus on training and improving their employees’ knowledges, or their lifetime customer values will drop badly.

*Should not ask for Javier when you come here. It was a nightmare for me* Their customer service can't improve in this location because they are not taking customers’ feedback rather than protecting a group of employees. This is 21 century not an ancien regime. Stop working for a customer-oriented company if you don’t know how to serve.<//text>

I was pleasantly surprised at the service I received while visiting. It does take a lot to keep a business like this afloat and while making customer service your top priority, some may see this as challenging. I would definitely return as they rank high marks with me on the appearance and maintenance side. They got me up and running on my lunch break. These guys are the best!< /text>

This store at first did not want to help, after I initiated service with an older salesman he activated a new phone.I then explained that I needed to lower my cable bill due to not utilizing all channels.  He acted like he took care of it but he did not actually do it because it shows in his reflected sales quota. After finding this out from atnt service assistance I saw the unprofessionalism in commission sales and realized customer service was last. Shame!</text>

Worst experience ever came here to solve a problem I was having with the transference of my phones and the attitude of the people working here was terrible. They say they  couldn't help and told me to call customer service. The worst thing is that they even tried helping. So I went to another store near CSUF and they solve the problem completely. No like the guys in this store. So If you really want a good costumer service don't go to this store.< /Text>

<Review>Place is the worst for customer service.  Went in for new service. And ending up with 2 extra lines that I knew nothing about until I got the bill. It took 3 months and a lot of hours in store and with customer care  and I still have 1 of them on my bill 650 also have a collection company on my credit report from them. For a bill that was store error not mine. Save yourself the trouble and go to the store at main place mall in Santa Ana<//Review>< Rating>

The man who helped us "Carlos" I believe his name was, was horrible with customer service. He was rude to my grandfather about a simple math problem. And he didn't even attempt to help us. All he did was tell us to call a number which we have called a million times only been told to go into the store. AT&T is useless. And so is this store. Now not only did we not get our problem fixed we owe more money then we should. Most of the employees just stood around talking or looking at their phones.This place is a trainwreck. Can't wait to leave this company honestly.</review>

Didn't even tell me that they added more things until I saw my bill...go to another Att store rather than this dump.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
Came here after being directed by DirecTV technical support to exchange some equipment.  Seemed like a simple solution to my problem, but the right hand and left hand are not talking to each other with AT&T and DirecTV, so they had no clue at the AT&T store and claimed they did not do equipment replacement despite what DirecTV is telling people.

Okay, that's bad, but not really this store's problem.  My dissatisfaction with this store comes when the acting floor manager, Raphael, proceeds to refuse to provide any help at all other than smiling and waiting for me to leave.  He refuses to contact anyone or make any effort to sort the problem out for me.  His company is giving customers bad information which leads them to him, and he refuses to show any responsibility for his company's actions or attempt to make any correction.  Internal failures between AT&T and DirecTV are not an excuse for the customer, and if you work for either of those companies and see a problem happening right in front of you, you'd think as a manager you might feel some responsibility to do something about that, but not at this location apparently...</review>

It's a crazy busy store. Very noisy & claustrophobic. All cell phone stores suck, but this is one of the worst (of all carriers) stores I've been forced to visit, twice. Good Luck</text>

Much like everyones experience at a ATT corporate store, no help at all would be an improvement!

The store manager Crystal could not have cared less about me, other customers, or the job of managing the ATT retail store.  Seriously considering paying whatever i have to in order to switch to another cell phone provider for my family.  I have received better treatment/service at the t-mobile store when the guy shadowed me, no hovered on me, literally breathing on me as if i was going to steal one of their tied down locked up phones.  As irritating as that was, the pure ineptness i was faced with at this corporate store on harbor and orange thorpe surpassed that trashy treatment at tmobile.

ATT corporate why cant you hire young employees with the same enthusiasm to help actual customers as they have for their personal cell phones checking out their facebook account and gossiping with other employees laughing about nonchalantly.  At the very least let go/fire the current management at this store.  Your network and phone service is outstanding, its a shame that most people dont or wont get to experience it due to the fact this employee crystal she said her name was is so off putting, rude, disrespectful, fowl, and condescending most potential customers would head right out the door, if not for the hills, never to return !

At the very least i will never or any of my friends will ever return here.  It even makes me long for the days of siri helping me out (10 year Android Customer)

Sincerely Regret ever coming to this store - Chad Mac Donald 1/17/17</Review>

<review>Worst experience don't ever go there.
These guys are big liars.
I went to the this store on sunday and they told me that as they cant get the credit check done on sunday I have to come some other day.
I again went today.
I actually went to sign a 2yr contract for Iph 6 plus for my wife and add her to my plan.
The guy first apologized that they turned us down the other day so they are offering us the phone free but we have to shop for the accessories equal to the upfront downpayment for 2yr contract i.e. $300.
I thought that was amazing and we did get accessories for $300.
When i came home and tried to activate the phone it asked me to agree to the 30 month at&t next contract which has $0 downpayment.
So he actually made us shop for $300 saying that I talked to my manager and we are offering you this deal because of the inconvenience caused the other day and instead of getting a 24month plan he sold us a 30month plan.
I will be going back tomorrow to return everything to this place.
Never going back there again.
Dont waste your time guys.
These people are big liars.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
Came here after speaking to an att representative on 611 about an early upgrade for my phone. They allowed me to get an upgrade and I visited the store they advised for me to go for the new phone. Rene at the store was very helpful but the manager was just a prick. He wouldn't even honor what was written by att coorporate office on their notes to allow me for an early upgrade. Wasted my time and gas coming to this store. Called att again and they said they will contact me when they get the phone I'm looking for in their office and for now I'll need to use this broken phone. What manager doesn't want to hear what their customers have to say? I better get a call from someone from this store to fix this issue or I'll leave this review as a one star for now.<//Review>

Came in to add a watch to my plan and Javier took the time to review my bill and told me he was able to save me quite a bit of cash. He asked me if I had served and I did so he hooked me up with my military discount. It was my first time at this store and for sure I'll keep coming. Great service and very knowledgeable.<//Review>
