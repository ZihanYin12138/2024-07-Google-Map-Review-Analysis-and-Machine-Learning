<review>My experience with K-9 Companions is an A++.  Diane and her team of professional trainers worked to take my two overly indulged labradoodle puppies and after a matter of weeks, delivered them home as well mannered dogs who solidly knew 5 basis commands. Our 10 month old female puppy and her 5 month old male puppy sibling were, and still are, an absolute pleasure to have in the house. We could not be happier or more appreciative of the quality training, caring atmosphere and the excellent value. K-9 Companions reliably delivers what they promise and for a fair price to boot.  Thank you Diane and Scott! I highly recommend your company and your services!!< /review><username>Linda Victor< /username><user_id>104948151970421804614<//user_id>< Date>

Wow! Where do I even start! We love our Girl, but man...She is now the most obedient puppers we’ve ever had thanks to K-9 Companions Dog Training, our love is on overload for her now!! She sits, stays, comes on command, walking on a leash is now a breeze, goes to her crate/place when asked and stays there, isn’t chewing up things, bullying the cats, knows her boundaries and what areas she can’t cross... all around beautiful trained girl, I could not be more thankful for their amazing job and their even more amazing staff! We loved how her Trainer, Nova, came by the house and refreshed Our girl on her skills, we are so grateful for all she has been taught at this place, we highly recommend friends!</Text>

Recently had my 2 dogs, Ginger and Lando attend the bootcamp at K9 companions. We were so happy with the results. Our dogs came back well mannered, and calmer. They even worked with my husbands wheelchair and training the dogs to walk with him and the wheelchair. I will be sending my dogs back for the board and brush up program they have here too!!!< /review>

I went for our consultation and I'm very happy with the location, the atmosphere so peaceful and perfect. I have a young adult with Autism and just seeing his reaction when Diane spoke and how he felt at the location, very happy and at peace,  and for him to say yes my dog can stay here for his training, that's a miracle. That shows how good my son feels overall. We decided as a family that our English Lab will do his training at K9 Companions.</Text>

We are so pleased by the service and professionalism provided. Walks are enjoyable, boundaries are in place at home, commands are being followed.

The staff was kind, smart, friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The grounds were clean, well kept and large. Our Ben arrived and was very timid and shy. The friendly and helpful staff greeted him slowly and won him over immediately.
When we picked up Ben after the two weeks, he was happy, energetic and excited to show us all he learned. Walking him before boot camp was not as enjoyable as it is now. Ben is much more obedient now and we are enjoying him more than ever. We love taking him to restaurants since we know he will can be trusted to stay in a "down/stay" command while we enjoy our meal.
We have had our in home visit and took advantage of the training time we have at the facility as well. When we travel it is so nice to know when we drop him off to be boarded, he will also receive more training. Ben loves seeing the trainers and staying with them while we are on vacation. The facility is a little over an hour drive for us and totally worth it. We will forever be grateful for all the training and endless help we receive from K9.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I had a wonderful experience with K-9 Companions. They are very caring of my puppy Penny Lane, Penny for short.  Love how professional they are in caring and training Penny while she was at their facility. Penny was able to graduate from K9 Boot camp and now we have to get her to pass the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) before returning for her 2nd  phase of training to become my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Mobility Service Dog. KUDOS to Diane Vaughn (Manager), and Shelby Taylor (Penny's trainer). I highly recommend this organization to anyone that would need to have their dogs trained or boarded.</Review>

My fur baby's 2 weeks boot camp is so amazing.  I have seen a lot of changes on her, it really helps a lot!  The price i paid is worth!

All the staff are awesome, friendly and always ask questions if you have any concerns.  The trainers are all good, they know what they are doing.

They had helped my baby a lot.  I will save money again for the next level!  Can't wait to see my fur baby for more training,

Thanks K-9 Companions!<//Review>

K-9 Companions - what a great place!   The staff loves dogs and it shows in everything they do from their interactions, cleanliness and training techniques.   The facility is very clean, well maintenance and just beautiful.   Tucker, our boxer, after only one boot camp is a new dog - more behaved, focused and trainable.   We look forward to continuing our training with K-9 Companion.   Beverly and Kory Andrew<//Review>

My dog ended up better trained than I am. Although I was worked with also by the good people of K-9 Companions so that I ended up as refined as my dog. Our life together is more pleasant and easier with the training he received. It goes far beyond being referred to as "obedience school". I have no doubt that every dog could benefit from the expertise exhibited by the trainers at K-9 Companions. What a great place and a great value.<//Review>

After losing our beloved older female Husky, we adopted a two-year female Husky from the animal shelter.  After bringing her home, the sweet dog that we met at the animal shelter suddenly became a holy terror.  Not only was she driving our older male Husky crazy, she was biting and chewing on everything including us.  After three weeks of canine craziness, we contacted K-9 Companions and immediately enrolled Sierra in the three-week Boot Camp.  Now after attending Boot Camp and several follow-up lessons, we are proud to say that Sierra is truly part of our family.  K-9 Companions not only trained Sierra but they provided us with the instruction and tools to become the "Alpha" that she loves and respects.  The staff is great and we would like to special kudos to Shelby and Danielle for all their tips and insight over the last several months.  We highly recommend K-9 Companions.</Text>

I love K-9 Companions!  We have put five dogs through training over the years, and each one came back with their same wonderful personalities, just with much better manners.  Each trainer we have worked with has been wonderful.  The facilities are clean and the dogs appear to be happy.<//Review>

<text>I brought our newly rescued very angry/frightened 90 pound German Sheppard in for a 30 minute evaluation and the trainer was able to show me that she had never been abused and was eager to learn and very trainable. The trainer said this could be done by weekly training or in two weeks of boot camp and we choose the Boot Camp. Two weeks later we picked up a very happy very obedient dog who is really fun to be around. The price of the Boot Camp includes a training session at our home as well as six training sessions during the next year at the facility. We are thrilled with the follow up. And instead of having to pay for someone to play with her during boarding K9 Companions will board her and train her free of charge every day she's there as a brush up. This is a win-win situation for everyone! Thanks!</text>< Rating>

I have a new German Shepherd puppy that was in serious need of basic training because of his extremely high energy. I live alone which made the desire to have him under control even more of a necessity. When he was too young to get a rabies shot (14 weeks old) I found a private trainer that would accept him for 3 week basic obedience and keep him separate from any other dogs (full shots are a necessary requirement). That did help some and gave him a decent head start, but the results after a lot of $$ and 3 weeks away from my new puppy were not everything that is advertised, which is generally the same for most puppy “boot camps”. When he was a couple months older with all of his shots and much more work with him on my own at home, I decided to look for a more comprehensive training facility and was recommended K-9 Companions from somebody at the doggie day care he goes to. When I took him in for evaluation I anticipated that he would be going to the intermediate/off leash, 2nd level program. He was way ahead of the game from a first timer but not up to the standards K-9 Companions expects after their 1st level of obedience. He had to brush up and advance his basic training (sit, stay, heel, down, come, no, off...) for one week and was able to move on to the next level for the next 2 weeks. He came back a different dog! Still as sweet and playful as he had been from day 1, but he obeyed everything he was taught as if he was having fun doing it. When I take him for walks or anyone comes to the house, every single person who meets him can’t believe how well behaved he is for such an energetic puppy. I have even recommended to several people that they take their misbehaving or untrained adult dogs to K-9 Companions for at least basic obedience. I am certain that it has done as much for my dog’s quality of life as it has for my own enjoyment of him, and believe that would be true for any dog owner/parent. After a couple more months at home with me, he does SO well and enjoys working on everything he has learned so much, I decided to put him through more advanced training. I had already taken him back for short boarding and brush up training and he absolutely loves the staff, as they do him. No separation anxiety at all (I may have a little:) and he was genuinely excited to be back. There was no hesitation at all as the quality of the facility and the care he is given there is top notch. In researching dog training facilities the first thing reviewers and experts say is to do your homework on the facility, they are not all equal. I am 100% comfortable knowing my baby is in great hands at K-9 companions. He is currently there as I’m writing, going through his off-leash and advanced training. I could not recommend this facility and their staff any more than saying my dog is now on his third stay there and I know he is loving it as much as I will be when he comes home. The follow up training that is included has been invaluable more in the sense of training ME than my dog. He knows exactly what to do, it’s up to me to know how to properly communicate with positive reinforcement. This training is worth every penny and will pay back dividends with years of enjoyment for both you and your dog. I have owned many dogs throughout my life and never had one formally trained. I thought they were so smart (they were) but had never realized their full potential. I thought my own training that only came from years of repetition was enough. I had no idea the difference professional training would make and am now a firm believer that if anybody has the means to do it, like me they would consider it a necessity.</text>

< review>
We love k9 companions! We were challenged with having a wild husky puppy that continued to outsmart us and we didn’t know what to do. We knew we didn’t want to get rid of him but his behavior was a lot to handle and we couldn’t even take him on walks to get his energy out because he would drag us down the street. We came across K9 companions and after meeting with the friendly office staff decided that the best thing for him would be sending him to their 3-week training. It was hard to have him gone for 3 weeks but we are SO thankful and happy we went through with the decision. During the process, they had multiple trainers work with him and they keep them on a very consistent schedule. After the 3 weeks were up and it was time to pick him up we could immediately see how much he had learned and how much more obedient he was. Then they ran us through all of the commands in order to teach us how to work with him. The biggest part of the training process is to continue to train your dog daily in your home and they made it easy for us to learn what we needed to do. As part of the K9 companions program that we choose an instructor came out to our house about a month (might have been a couple weeks… cant remember) after we brought him home and went through all of the training with us again. To follow up on the training, as part of the package they also offered 8 monthly 1- on-1 training classes with us at their facility. Although it was hard to take our husky in an hour car ride each way it was totally worth it and this was a huge key to the success of having our husky trained. Not only did it keep us accountable but also allowed us to refresh our skills. There is no quick fix in having a trained dog and it is a lot of work but if you are willing to put in the effort I highly, highly, highly recommend working with K9 companions. All of their instructors are extremely knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. I can happily say that I can easily take my husky on walks with him heeling, he knows his name, knows how to sit, stay, come, laydown, he knows that he isn’t allowed on the bed/couch and he will even wait for us to give him the “ok” to walk through doors. Our husky is now almost two and continues to test us daily but we are thankful to K9 companions for getting him to a place where he listens to us.< /review>

< Review>
K9 Companions is truly second to none. I have been in the dog boarding/ training business for twenty years and I know a good place when I see one. I have also been a student in their trainers course and have spent seven weeks at the facility so I have first hand knowledge on how the business operates and how they treat the dogs. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, the facility is always clean, and the dogs well-being is always first priority.  Karen, the owner, has always been extremely friendly and always there to answer any questions that I have had. I have had many of my own dogs and my family's dogs trained by K9 Companions, and I have never had any problems or complaints. If you are looking for the best training facility in Southern California look no further.</Review>

<review>[This review is edited. I have since used their services and have added to this review! See the bottom.]

I used their service for my Great Pyrenees which is known to be a stubborn breed as it pertains to training. Upon his return he was completely leash trained, would stop at all doors and gates to be let in or out by me, but definitely the best thing was his manners. He would seem to want to understand what I wanted him to do and when he did it made him noticeably more happy.

I'm giving this place a 10/10! My only small gripe is the price but I am a firm believer in getting what you pay for.
------------------------------------------------
Old review:
I am considering this location for my Great Pyrneese. While I haven't used them personally , I have had friends with multiple dogs use their services. Having witnessed the difference I would say that you could trust this place. I will update my review once I get my pup through the training there.

Also, if you read a negative review, check out that person's review history. If they have a tendency to write negative ones it's probably a sign that they're unhappy somewhere else in life and aren't considering that businesses suffer from negative reviews; especially ones that are unwarranted.< /review>< Pictures>

He was a happy,  jumper, nipper, half crazed when he saw other dogs, dog. I felt every day when I walked him my arms were an inch or two longer, from him pulling us all the way. It was a little more that we felt we could handle on our own. So we put him in the boot camp. What we got back was a happy, calm,  well adjusted member of our family. Honestly like night and day. But we are even happier to take him back a month later for the first of his onsite long leash training.  He jumped out of the car, tail wagging a mile a minute. When he saw his trainer, he was so excited, he broke training and jumped up to greet her. All the time he was working with us, he was eager to please, focused on getting it right.We love this dog, and want him to be a member of our family for a very long time.; K-9, all the great staff made it possible.  We are confident if any problems arise that we can't handle, they will get Percy and  most importantly, us on the right track. Thank you, Thank you. Money well spent.

<Review>We just picked up our 6 month labradoodle from Boot Camp.  I could not be happier with the results.  She no longer jumps on the children and is following all her commands.  I feel confident that she will now be a wonderful companion to our family.  I look foreword to the in-home training to help reinforce her behavior.  I would recommend K-9 Companions to anyone who would like help setting boundaries with their pet.</Review>< Rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I think it is important for anyone considering a free consultation at K-9 Companions to understand that the reason for the consultation is to evaluate the dogs temperament and the needs of both the dog and the client. Some dogs need to see a veterinarian for medical or temperament issues due to medical issues prior to training. Some people wish to train their dogs in a manner that is as inexpensive as possible and therefore need to spend more time being involved in the training themselves (such as driving to the facility weekly) and not boarding the dog while training. Other clients prefer to have as much as possible done for them and would prefer to board the dog (costs more) and have as much of the training as possible done for them. Some dogs actually need this level of training due to a lack of socialization or due to them being fearful or aggressive. There is no way that a trainer can tell an owner over the phone what the dog is going to need. This is why the consultation is FREE. The training prescribed could be as little as a (local) in home lesson for $100.00. It could be lessons at the facility for $250-$495. The client might want lessons done in their home (at a higher cost) or they might want the Mercedes of dog training which involves the dog staying (boarding) at the facility, followed by lesson/s in their home and a number of follow up lessons over the next year at the facility.< /text>< pics>

This will be his third time at the center, and we would not drive 90 minutes for training/boarding if we were not completely satisfied with our prior experiences.  Leo completed basic training about 4 years ago, then off leash training last year, and now we're hoping to take him to the next level.    I was surprised to see a few really bad reviews about this place and felt compelled to write my own.  I don't normally write reviews, but I also never get very excited about any business.  This is a great place to train your dog and I highly recommend them.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I took my lab puppy to this facility for basic training. Upon checking in your dog; they do a health inspection. i was told that my dog had bloat and would die if I didn't take her to the vet right away. I left in tears took her to the vet to find there was nothing wrong with my dog. I called this training facility and told them that my dog was completely healthy and their vet had misdiagnosed my dog. Not to my surprise their health inspected is not even a certified veterinarian. I made the decision to put my dog through the training program that they offered. I was happy with the results of the training and liked the trainer they worked with her. Recently I took my dog back because we were going on vacation and they offer a boarding and brush up training for their stay. When I called to book the reservation I was told the price per day that there was a seven day minimum stay and that I needed to give a 50$ deposit to hold her spot. I told the staff that I would be gone 9-13 days and asked if there would be any issues if I had to pick her up a little earlier than 13 days. I was told there would be no problem with that. I dropped my dog off on the first paid in full for 13 days and called on the 3rd to let them know I would be picking her up on the 10th. Upon my return I was told that they would not refund my money for the 3 days she was not staying but I would get a credit for the money I had paid up front. I asked the staff for a copy of the agreement I had signed that stated that was the terms of our agreement. They could not provide me with one. I was then notified by management that if I wanted a partial refund of the 3 day boarding fee the contract would be voided and my dog would not be welcome to complete her training program. The amount in dispute is 134$ after I had paid them over 2000K. K-9 Companions staff have such poor business practice that they will upset a client over such a minimum amount and can not even provide Prof of this so called no refund policy.< /text>

{'time': 1368984997454, 'text': "This is a very unreasonable client.  She was in fact sent a copy of a 72 hour cancellation policy.  We are not a boarding facility we are a training facility that books our employees based on our training needs.  We are refusing other clients potentially due to availability.  The client called at the last minute to pick up her dog early.  Our policy is to unused funds on file with appropriate notice (which wasn't given) but we offered this anyway.  This wasn't good enough for her.  She then attempted to charge back for her ENTIRE stay meaning that she was trying to take back funds for services that WERE rendered to her dog.  Regarding the bloat issue, she was not told her dog was bloating.  She was told her dog's stomach was distended and it should be checked.  She actually agreed and said that it never normally looked that large.  Did she really not want us to point out something that could have been an issue?"}< /Response>

I read all the reviews about k-9 companions and I do not believe what everyone has to say about this place.  I decided to take my puppy in for puppy training as he is a handful.  I put him in the 3 week training course and when I picked him up he learned how to sit, stay walk on a lease all basic training.  He looked really good and clean when we picked him up.  We went over all his commands with the trainer.  by reading some of the reviews on yelp, and other sites people do not understand that training a dog takes not only a trainer but the owner of the dog to help with the training.  When your dog comes home it is up to the owner to make sure that dog keeps training on what he has learned at the training camp.  When you pick up your dog please do not think he is fully trained, it will take more than a couple weeks and you need to spend time with your dog and training.  I picked my puppy up and yes he walks by your side, sits when you stop, but there are times he get distracted and will not listen.  I work with my puppy every day on what he has learned and he is doing great.  I am taking Tiny back for 8 days while I am out of town and I know he will be getting a brush up on his training.  I could have kept him home with my daughter but she would not be able to over see his puppy training since she has a child of her own to care for and that could be a set back for his basic training.  I have good faith that Tiny is in good hands.  Love the place and the personnel that work there.  Thank You guys great job.<//text>

We live in San Diego (100 miles away), so we called K-9 Companions to get information.  I spoke with 'K.a.r.e.n'.  She gave me info and quoted me a price between $595-995 (max).

When we got there - the price had nearly trippled!!! (now it's $1699).

We wasted 3 hours in the car (plus 1 hour waiting for them because they were behind on appointment times) for a total of 4.5 hours wasted, all because they were deceiving to us on the phone, to get us in the door.

If you are considering this facility - you better think again.  They have hidden fees like you would not believe.</Text>< Rate>

Catie duffy, this place has been infected with this terrible virus for many years, 6 years ago I worked for a local veterinarian. We constantly treated dogs that came from k-9 companions infected with the pnemonia or influenza. Something is not right with this location. I wouldnt recomment this place to anyone. Maybe the training is good, personaly I wouldnt know, but the facility is infected and they lied to you about there unknowns. Its too bad making money is a priority over the health of there customers. They should have covered all your costs.<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1494267710699, 'text': "Absolutely not true. The facility was bought by a new owner and completely redone. It has passed all inspections with flying colors. We use the same disinfectants for sanitizing as veterinarian hospitals use, it is much more costly to do that but our main concern is for the dogs in our care. For your information we have only had to take 1 dog to the vet in the past year and a half and it wasn't for anything that we caused. Please do not post false reviews and comment on something you know nothing about. I notice all of your reviews are negative, if you would like to get anymore correct information please feel free to call our office."}</response>< gmap_id>

My family and I were in the process of moving into a new home in Lake Arrowhead and decided that our 10 month old Chesapeak Bay Retriever, Hank, needed formal training. We met with Dianne for our consultation and she assured me when Hank was done with boot camp that he would be an extremely well behaved young pup.We dropped Hank off August 2 and would be picking him up on August 23rd.

9 days into doggy training (August 11th), I received 4 back to back phone calls from a blocked number. I had my wife call and K9 Companions said Hank wasn't looking well so they took him to the vet. About an hour after they brought him back from the vet, they called saying we needed to pick him up immediately and take him to our vet. When we picked Hank up, he couldn't stand up and could barely lift his head. I had to carry him. You could tell he was extremely ill.

I took him to our local vet and the Dr took one look at Hank and said this is extremely concerning. He did X-rays and ran a parvo test. Hank came back negative for parvo and didn't have any foreign bodies lodged in his stomach but he had fluid in his lungs and was running a high fever. The vet told me, if I do not take Hank to the 24/7 emergency vet in Ontario, that Hank would not make it through the night.

I rushed Hank down the mountain and he was admitted immediately on the spot. The vet told me that Hank was in extremely rough shape and there is a chance he will not see the following morning.

Hank spent 5 days at the emergency vet with 24/7 care. Fortunately, he pulled through. He contracted a viral infection, a bacterial infection, para influenza and developed and pneumonia. Our total medical bills were over $6,000. The vet said he contracted it from this place.

K9 Companion assured us that they have never seen a case like this and that there have been no other cases of dogs getting this sick. The K9 companion staff seemed to be concerned about Hank the entire time, until it was time to talk about the bill. Dianne, the manager, was extremely worried about Hank and genuinely cared about Hanks health. She presented all the findings and bills to the owner. The owner, Laura said, there will be no reimbursement for Hanks medical bills.

K9 Companions is responsible for almost killing my dog and burying me in a financial hole. My wife stays at home with our 16 month old son. I am the sole provider. I am an Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran and still serve in the military. Our bills are worth two months of pay and we still have to take Hank in to be checked frequently to make sure his lungs have 100% recovered.

Once Hank returned home we had multiple vet visits and required attention at all times from my wife. We had to cancel a family vacation that was planned due to this nightmare. After 4 weeks of being on 3 different types of medication, having to doing breathing treatments, under constant supervision and having to be extremely careful with him, our puppy is starting to act like himself again. We are so thankful for the 24 hour Vet that saved our dogs life.

Bottom line is, do not take your dog here unless you want to deal with what we have dealt with. Morality has taken a back seat to these people and all they care about are pure profits.

***I have been in contact with another dog owner that had a similar experience as us. If you have had something similar to this, please get into contact with us!***</Text>

Woof!  My name is Peter Maximus and I'm a 1 1/2 -year old Weimeraner.  I would like to bark high praises for my Alma Mater, K9 Companions, a loving environment for a puppy away from home.  (Okay, it's a tough-as-nails (Grrrr!) boot camp and I passed Basic Training with flying paws!)  But that was a year ago and now I'm back for the third time (see, I can even count now)!  My owners are off traveling again and are very happy each time they come home that I survived, learned a lot, and came away a better pooch for the experience.<//Review>

This place is a joke it was court ordered for me to do dog. Obedience training so I picked this place  I did my consultation everything was good I came back a week later to make my first payment $375 out of 750 they were nice enough to split the payments for me    My third visit which was my second payment of 375 which is finally a total of 750 I was able to start dog training B The first training was OK pretty basic light training didn't really  learn anything I didn't already know the dogs didn't learn anything they didn't already know the second dog training class was last Saturday they switch trainers for my male dog but not my female my female is the one that needs socialization skills Saturday night  Nola my female started coughing real bad turns out she has kennel cough  And I'm pretty sure she got it from their considering I've been to court five times because of her I don't take her out in public or anywhere the only place she goes is k9companions on Saturday.     I've done two of the six classes didn't learn anything new my dog got sick they won't give me my money back not even my money -2 unfilled lessons !

I think it's funny they took $375 before ever seen shot records

Neither one of my dogs have the shot that prevents kennel cough

The lady is able to tell that by looking at the shot records at the dog training class but didn't care enough to recommend me to get the dogs though shots but she cared enough to take my second payment and get started right away  The lady is able to tell that by looking at the shot records at the dog training class but didn't care enough to recommend me to get the dogs those shots but she cared enough to take my second payment and get started right away
Now don't you think if they were as compassionate about their animals as they say they were they probably would've at least recommended or preferred me to do that I mean you're the professional .

Don't you think it's kind of weird there doggy boot Camp is the only thing that requires the board at Tele or board at nova shot shot which is the medicine that prevents kennel cough  boot Camp is the only thing that requires the Tele or board nova shot shot which is the medicine that prevents kennel cough
Which they say is an airborne virus

Why only the dog staying overnight need the vaccination for an airborne virus if you train those dogs in the same exact place as you train my dogs using the same melon cutters unwashed that just sit there this is Stipid  i'm out $750 didn't get any training my female dog is sick and now I can't afford it

Do not go here they are scam artist they just want your money</Text>

TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE place.  Do not send your pet there.  All these other recommendations are fake.  We sent our puppy there and after 18 days he ended up  sick and and neglected.  Our Vet said it was total neglegence and the owner of k9 companions didnt even admitt there was an issue, instead she blamed my husband and I of being overreactive, and treating our dog like a child.   Biggest scam Ive ever experienced.  We are filing a suit and reported them to animal control..  Be very careful.  I encourage anyone with a bad experience to speak out, because we based our decision on where to send Charlie on these reviews and that was a huge mistake...<//Text>

Her dog had a cold nothing more nothing less.  Yes, it happens in EVERY KENNEL at times just like a school of children.  If someone tells you different that is false.  The difference here is that this woman was provided with basic meds but took her dog to see her vet anyway. That's fine no problem with that.  When her vet told her it was an ordinary cold and her dog would get over it soon with the meds we provided she wouldn't believe him.  Took him to emergency, then a specialist, and demanded we pay for the unnecessary vet bills.  Her dog was fully trained but she refused to move forward so yes we do disagree and we do see this as a total overreaction on their part."}<//Response>

I've known Karen and George Duet professionally in the working dog community for over 10 years.

When I first became involved in French Ring sport is the first time I heard their names mentioned in the working dog circles and this was in the early 90s.  They even brought over a French decoy and trainer that really gave the sport a kick start in Southern California.

We then off and on through the years would see each other at dog seminars inwhich sometimes we both attended and other times one or the other were teaching.

They have an indept understanding of dog behavior and have trained all breeds of dogs.

Recently I had the opportunity to visit their facility (this month).  Very professional and beautiful facility with spacious clean kennels and beauitfully landscaped training field.  Beautiful setting to have your dog and yourself attend classes in Lake Matthews.

Duets have trained working dogs (police and detection) as well as advanced obedience and are very good with problem dogs.

Karen has also co-authored dog training book for Schutzhund.  I have learned a lot about the business side of dog training too from them.</Text>

We took our rescue dog Finn to K9 Companions in October 2015 for the 3 week boot camp.  We absolutely love our little Cairn Terrier mix that we rescued earlier on in the year, but he was showing signs of fear based aggression and some alpha traits that were not going down well in our home.  The last straw was when he tried to bite the roofers leg and we decided if he was going to be with us for the rest of his life (as we hoped) then something had to change. We returned to a new dog... one that sat, down and stayed for his commands.  One that listened, heeled and was generally a much better behaved member of the family.  His trainer (Karla) came to our house the same week we picked him up for a home session, and after he squealed and cried with joy to see her, she showed us some more fabulous commands to train him with.  I have just booked him back in for Board & Brush up which I know he will love (and I will be thrilled to know he is being taken care of and learning while I am gone!).
Thank you K9 Companions<//Text>

< Review>
I went for a 2019 Goldwing Update so I can use my Android Auto. And the technician went above and beyond. He completely checked my bike and adjusted my e-brake at no charge. The update was free as well. I will be back for service here though. They know what they are doing. The owner Robert was super nice too.</Review>

<Text>Fernando in the Parts Department ordered some small-but-important parts for my bike. He gave an accurate delivery estimate, called as soon as they came in, and then went the extra mile to get it installed before I left. It was a quick fix, and he sent me on my way with a handshake (well, elbow bump), a solid bike, and great service. Thank you and see you next time!<//Text>< rate>

Great customer service. It was my first time buying a bike and William (sales person) really helped me out and made me feel comfortable. No pressure on making me buy it. I would recommend to a friend who is thinking of purchasing their first bike.< /text>

Got a good price and had great service from Stefan and Casey in Sales.  Went back two days later to pick up my bike, and the owner (Rob/Bob) was the only sales person in the place.  He was helping customers without wearing a mask (the law in LA County at the time).  When he asked to help me, I commented that he wasn't wearing a mask, he said, "I don't wear a mask."  I told him that it was the law, and he shrugged.  I won't buy another bike from him.< /Review>

So I am currently looking to purchase an ATV and have heard good things about Honda so I figured I would go in and check theirs out first. I got there and was greeted by Robert. I had told him what I was looking for and at 1st he tried to have me look into a SxS which is not what I want. All he told me was that Honda was the best out of the other competitors (Can Am, Polaris, etc.) but he didn't explain why. This was the perfect time for him to show me what Honda offered that the others did not. To say the least customer service was mediocre and I will go elsewhere.< /review>

<Review>Liars! I called and asked for a availability for a ATV, I spoke to a guy in sales and he confirmed they had the specific ATV I was looking for, I drove all the way from the San Fernando Valley to Carson (40) miles FOR NOTHING! And when I got there the people there in sales were sitting there watching there phones so I had to walk into there office instead of being greeted and they proceed to tell me they don't carry the ATV and never have!

Worked with a nice guy named Eric on potentially getting a grom; ended up not pulling the trigger but appreciated that I could be honest about my purchase intentions without having a pushy salesman try and close the sale regardless. These are the dudes you wanna buy a bike from, no BS.< /Text>

<review>It was my first time at the dealership just walking in and browsing through. The newer Hondas look really nice there's some style and also a lot of prices that look pretty good. The salesman that I met was friendly and was willing to give additional discounts. I think I'll go back when I have more time and check it out again< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Fernando in parts! Hands down best experience ever. I’m rebuilding(while driving) a neglected cbr600rr  and this “gawd” sent saved me from waiting a month for a terminal nut.(stuck at work isn’t fun at all)

Along with the parts depo. All the them guys. I had to peace together my vt600 as well, answered every question I had and always gave me a lot of “inside” knowledge.<//Text>

Came here to buy a cb300r on a Saturday afternoon. Was not too busy and was directed to sales who was very helpful and friendly. Buying process took longer than anticipated but they managed to save me over $400 for choosing the right financing plan.

These people are NOT NICE nor do they go the extra mile as some have indicated. I had a horrible experience. Staff are unhelpful and DISINTERESTED. Ended up going to MidCity Honda and bought the Honda Monkey for 4800 - MUCH LESS than these guys quoted. Go to Mid City - they were wonderful and honest!< /Review>

They quoted me 800$ then after a day they started saying it will be 2000$ then 2600$ exact with "discounts" they gave me.I asked for written diagnosis they never gave it to me but instead they gave me a repair order of what needs to be done. Funny enough, that repair order says 0$ discount. Then they started trying to me make me sell my bike to them for 500$ and buy a new one for 14000$ and get their stupid citi bank card or the guy (Jimmy) he can personally buy it from me for 500. meanwhile the lovely mechanic who was "working" on my bike said he doesn't want to lowball me but he can buy it from me for 200$. they wasted a week of my life (the bike is my daily) and didn't even put my bike back together when I asked them to, to take it back. Literally worse customer service and scammers I've ever met in my entire life.< /text>< Rate>

Went to SoCal Honda Powersports to pick up a 2019 Honda CB300R with ABS,however only the base models were on the floor. Rob had no problem placing an order for one for me. The bike arrived very quickly, and I was able to get it delivered to my place of work. Shout out to Rob and Alan for taking such good care of me! If you're looking for a clean, friendly, and honest dealership to purchase your next Honda from, look no further~<//review>

<Text>Be aware, if you are a reliable customer as I was, they do not do anything nice for you.... NO commercial gesture for your fidelity, they even do not admit when they do mistakes with consequences for their customers. The rates applied for maintenance or repair the bike you bought in the same place are at 100$/hr (much more than the current rate) and Rob told me that they will increase soon to 125$/h... My last visit, they charged me 4 hrs of labor when it took only 2.5 hours.... That is not nice and at that rate it is a lot of money... No mercy for the customers.... The mechanic advises are good but their decisions are not. They replaced my OEM chain by an after market without telling me. 5 months later, my new chain broke during my slow ride (thanks god i was slow at that moment). I brought back the bike and they refuse to apply the warranty, and I was reproached many things I did wrong on the bike when I do regular maintenance and I proved to them. How a chain can broke so fast and easily!! I take care of my bike and I do care of my safety with regular maintenance. It is very rare and very dangerous to have the chain breaking, this never happen on a new chain... Except if you have a bad one like an aftermarket one and they never told you... I never put aftermarket parts involving the safety on my bike. Obviously they do. I do not recommend this dealership which does not care about the customers which is bad located, not nice and does not respect the customers and they just enjoy to charge you the most they can...<//Text>< Pictures>

Had some collision repair work done. Repair shop manager worked with my insurance and made sure every piece of the bike that was damaged/scratched was replaced. Bike was repaired to like new condition. Also had the dealership owner offer a loaner bike while mine was being fixed. When I'm ready for a new bike, I'm coming here.<//review>

Don't get your motorcycle worked on here.  Just brought in for recall repair and they scratched my motorcycle. The mechanic scatched the valve cover, parts of the frame, and the panel above the valve cover. He didn't put the panel back in place and didn't put the 2 hole plugs back. I'm very disappointed
This mechanic  didn't care.  This is not the kind of service I expected from Honda.I'll never buy anything from this place again.  I'll take my business elsewhere. I'm glad I warned these other 2 customers that were there to check their bikes before they leave.< /Review>

<review>Called today, 8-4-19, talked to Robert about a 2007 Honda Sabre 1100. It is listed for $3200.00 on the CycleTrader. He then tells me that the total price will $4500.00 with registration, inspection fee and taxes. Carson sales tax is 9.5%, that would be $304. That leaves $996 for "inspection fee and registration". I am glad I called first before driving 90 miles and be presented with this crock.  I call these BS.< /review><Rate>1<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x80dd34f7cad37e93:0x12dc3ccf29ae3d5< /Gmap_id>< name>

<text>Very highly recommend this place. Did not buy my bike from them but had to take it there for some warranty work. Bike had a body piece that was not fitting well. Had to leave the bike there for few days so they can work with Honda in addressing the warranty issue. Once it was completed, few days later, I went by to pick up the bike. At that time I was told that they didn't go through the warranty but fixed it themselves with no charge. This kind of things are not common place these days. While I was there I've had a very pleasant conversation with the service advisor, the mechanic. It is nice to see that a dealer who values customer service over making a buck. Thanks for the wonderful service. Will be dealing with you on my motorcycle needs from now on.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1469211872949, 'text': 'Thank you for your business.'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

The whole team was very friendly and took care of me and my cousin well. Keith was nice to help us load it onto the truck. Gave me tips on taking care of bike as well. You all are great! Thanks again. Ken< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Haven't purchased a new bike yet but my sales experience with Rob the Owner, was excellent.

Low key, refined & a gentlemen's approach was exactly how it should be done - I wanted to buy a bike without all the research just because.

Rob, his Employees & his store are a class act!<//Text>

<review>Salesman lied about the model I asked for saying that is not in production anymore.
This is a false statement and the guy should be fired because he tremendously damaged your dealership image.
The model was a 2020 Honda Forza 300.< /review>< Pictures>

Do not believe the false advertising!  The website advertised 4 vehicles at a reduced price.  After a few calls, the sales guy said that there was only one left. Per the conversation, it was "in the back" and he did not want to sell it to me.

At best, these guys are lazy and unwilling to work with you.  Or what seems most likely, these guys are using deceptive practices to get you in the door.    I would not do business with them.<//Text>

Called about a honda trx90 advertised for $2,289. Told me it would be $3,675 out the door.??? I asked about the dealer fees and was told they dont talk about the fees unless you are at the store?. Was just asking for a break down. So he just hung up on me. Great customer service. Tax and there fees are over 50% the cost of the bike. That is very miss leading and shady.< /text>

<Text>I met Eric today while I was looking for Honda motorcycles and he happens to be very knowledgeable with a very good attitude! he helped me to narrow down my selection I asking me questions and by presenting senarios. he has a lot of experience and I found him to be helpful and knowledgeable. of course he is focused on the sales process because that is why he is there, but at no time did I feel pressured or uncomfortable. I have narrowed it down to two bikes and I will be back on the weekend to make my selection.  I have some event this weekend too with demo rides and food or something. lots of inventory. Worth checking out for sure.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1469212225294, 'text': 'Thank you for the opportunity to earn your business. We hope to see you soon!'}< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>So I bought this F6B Honda 2 months ago from this store, it took a bit of negotiating , but in the end all was well and I drove off a happy customer.
I went to this store based upon my buddy having bought his there as well and was happy with the way they treated him.

Now comes the important stuff, since many stores have pleasant people working there to a greater degree,good inventory, selection, waiting lounges, free coffee, etc, etc, this is not what set stores apart from each other,and although important to some, for me the answer is the service after they have your money and what kind of service you gonna get in return for your time and money.

In my case I must say that I'm overly impressed by the way this store took care of business.

I developed two minor warranty issues with my plastic covers on the bike, went in to see the service   tech David who took a look of the issue at hand, took some pictures, and said he would contact Honda on the parts, and advise me on the warranty clause.

Two days later I was contacted by Mo in the parts department, who stated that my parts were there, Honda was going to cover the items, and whenever I was ready, to come on in for the install of the parts.

Now this is service, I did not have to hound them down, they contacted me, as it should have and gave me the option for the install time and date.

But it gets better, and no I do not get paid for writing this review.

The mechanic Dean who did this repair work was on the money,very professional,and knowledgeable and took time to explain the procedure .

This visit and repair was one of the best I have had, and I been around the block (riding M/C for 40 yrs) and have seen at least 3 other Honda shops for various state of repairs, but would not go back to any of them, for that there was always something what caused me to be upset, like they did not tighten the screws, forgot something, missing a part, etc, etc.

Anyhow I gladly drive the 80 miles one way to get my MC serviced here, and hope you will have as good fortune as I had.< /review>< pics>

Bought a new Honda 700x. Do not shop here they want your money by selling overpriced mortalcycles. Rob told me my service was free the first oil change for buying a new motorcycle but when I got there they wanted me to pay $250 dollars..  DO NOT SHOP HERE! They will say any lie to you while buying the motorcycle..the Asian lady is worst.< /text>

Rob (owner) did not think my business was important.
He did not want to be bothered to help a customer when asked for help.
Went by Friday to get help, was told that Rob would take care of me on Monday, instead Rob told me "why don't you go to where you bought the bike"  or come back when the bike has 600 mile.  They should have just told me on Friday we don't want to help you, so I could have taken cared of this simple issue on Saturday.  I would not come back to this place again. (I just bought a new Honda CBR 1000rr from Moto United....best deal in town)<//review>

<review>Amazing place to check out anything Honda power sports related. From street bikes to dirt bikes to riding gear and even a service garage. Excellent environment and staff is very helpful while not being pushy or mean like typical dealerships.

Took my cbr600rr in for service and the staff is super friendly and upfront with everything.</review>< date>

<Review>I came to this Shop few years ago. First time i brought my dirt bike in i spent $990 To fix it. On a $3000 Value bike. I rode it not even an entire Sunday and broke down again.
I brought the bike in (again) and i have been told that probably something else broke Inside the engine,(when they opened it One week earlier and i asked to check if any parts needed to be replaced)
After Inspection I have been told that i had to spend other $900 to fix it....
I decided to Do't fix it and i went to the shop to Get my bike yet.
Owner and Employee Told me that i had to pay $200 for Inspection,
Since i already Paid $990 and bike has not been fixed the first time i didi not want to spend anymore money.
Owner and employee Kidnapped my Motorcycle Because i didn't want to pay the $200 I almost had to call the Police and then I finally took it from the Shop without their Approval.
THIS PLACE IS A TOTAL SCAM AVOID IT IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF !!</Review>< name>

I'm going to find every possible way to never come here again.

Robert Cavenah is the sales and owner(GM) of this location and a complete liar and total thief.
Sure! He keeps a clean environment to shop. Everything else is shady business.
*Make them sign what they say they're offering.*

I feel bad for his parts dept. They're the good eggs. Casey and the team are the only reason I wouldn't give less than a 1-star.
There are stories of the mechanic dept holding bikes for months, because they didn't know what was causing issues.< /text>

Terrible customer service. Too lazy to help us get a quote. He refused to tell us any prices unless he ran our credit first, and he told us he couldn't get us an estimate when we were coming from another dealership that had done just that. They're dont take care of the customer, they only take care of themselves<//review>

<Review>DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.

I decided to check out the new Honda dealership since in the past I had to go out to Santa Monica or Irvine to check out new Honda motorcycles. Well, bottom line is, I will not be returning to this dealership. They wasted enough of my time today so I won't let them waste more by spending a long time on this review.

I stopped in on a Tuesday, spoke with the manager Mr. Cavenagh (Greg, I think) and said I was interested in trading in my 2012 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Custom for a 2015 Honda Fury, he said that would be great and I could come in with my bike any day and do a test ride and they could check out the trade. So i came in 2 days later with my bike, the sales person, Eric, whom I had been dealing with on the phone earlier in the day setting up the demo ride with, came out, checked out the bike, said it was great and had me turn it on, rev, etc. So then we go talk numbers, they offer me a fair enough amount for my trade, we come to an agreement on price after about an hour, which includes the usual way over invoice markup and whatnot, and they had the classic bait and switch (listed for $1000 less on their website) and make it sound like they are doing me a big favor by honoring...their own price they had listed... SO, Then comes the test ride to make sure I enjoy the bike (I have 4 bikes at the moment and am very particular about what I want in a new bike)

Eric says he doesn't have a demo bike for the Fury so it will be about and hour while they set one up so I can demo it. After some more waiting he comes back and says that  I can only demo ride if its sold to me (not much of a demo...if I own it) and also, they did not want to take my bike as a trade because its a Kawasaki and they are Honda only and don't really have the ability to take a non-honda in a trade. THIS is what made me really angry, the whole time they knew what bike I was interested in trading. They knew damn well it was not a Honda, and it's in great condition so that wasn't an issue (garage kept, only 3k miles, etc) Good enough condition that after checking it out they had offered me a good enough trade in value for us to advance to the next hour or so of negotiation. He said it was management that was to blame, yet when i spoke to general manager originally and set it all up, it was no issue at all. Nor is it an issue at any other dealership, even brand exclusive ones. Also, I should mention they have used NON HONDA bikes already on their website listed under pre-owned inventory.

So they literally wasted about 3 hours of my only day off (not to mention some gas money going over there again) What really pisses me off is that they were about to run my credit for financing, knowing they were just going to not take the trade and still try to sell me the Fury. Hoping I would just buy it anyways?

I'm still interested in the Fury, so I guess I will have to drive out to Mission Motorsports in Irvine (They have a great staff and no BS) What a disappointment though.

Totally a waste of time and energy for nothing.<//Review>< Pics>

<response>None<//response><text>I don't know where to start this i drop of my bike Wednesday around 5:30 they told me your bike will be checked by tomorrow and we will give you a call.  They never call back and i called Friday around 5pm and the guy on the phone told me we are busy with a police bike and we gonna check it tomorrow and give you a call . I waited to monday and i called back they told me he is not sure yet they busy but it might be value adjustment . And i told ok how much he said i dont know yet. I called back Wednesday and the guy on the phone told will call you back and he never call i went there to pick my bike and take it somewhere else and the manager was mad and told you have your bike not running for a year and you want it to be fix in week . Thats why i pay you for to fix it and thats why i took it to honda dealer which the bigest mistake i every done. And he said how old your bike i told him 2006 crf250r and he said we shouldn't accept it its old. And he charge me 100 for doing nothing to it. And told dont come back here because i asked him why you charge me that much for nothing. And i went inside his shop and they only have one mechanic. I will try to take them to court because they need someone to stop this business by next week i will file small claim. bad customer service bad management for big company like honda which i will contact them.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Horrible experience. These people ran my credit a couple of times causing it to drop my score and when it was brought up to the manager Erick and Rob all they said it was a mistake. Sucks I have to give them a star to write a review because -- they don't deserve a single start-- the way they handled the situation was so wrong and unprofessional. Never buying a thing here .</review>

(Translated by Google) The truth is, very bad experience, I canceled a guarantee for my truck and Francisco of financing gave us a terrible treatment, first very friendly and then very sharp for 2 years, the guarantee for the truck and, as you can see, it was very expensive, I canceled it after eight months and it was 2000 for two years and I had eight months with my truck and only four hundred returned to the bank, I think it was not fair to be careful with the guarantees of the purchase of those cars, ask what is deductible?

La verdad muy mala experiencia  cancele una garantía de mi troca  y Francisco de financiamiento nos dio un trato terrible primero muy amable y después muy cortante de 2 años la garantía  de la troca y como  mire q era muy cara la cancele a los ocho meses y era de 2000 por dos años  y tenía ocho meses con mi troca y sólo regresaron cuatro cientos al banco creo q no era lo justo cuidado con las garantías de la compra de esos carros pregunten q es deducible<//text>

Lovely stay. Relaxed and spent time with family. Beautiful atmosphere. Very close to clear water. Drinking water as pure as filtered water. Very cordial staff and guests. Tahoe altitude and thin air limited my activities. NP< /text>

You couldn't comfortably fit 4 adults but you could easily put a couple kids on the sofa bed. It was perfect for the two of us. We will for sure come back next time we are in Tahoe! Also, we left a few things behind and they called us right away to take care of it. Great service!< /review>< username>

Been coming here for years, during all seasons.  Great, quiet place on the north shore and it is a perfect get away for couples and families.  Property is small but nice,  with its own beach and dock.  Units are a little outdated but a absolutely sufficient for a week away from the rest of the world.  CAN'T BEAT THE VIEWS...<//Text>

< Review>
We are not very familiar with the resorts in Tahoe, but our experience at this one was very good.
Edgelake has a good size beach right on the lake that is especially good for families looking to spread out, with lots of sand for the kids. They also had the only two story boat dock pier that I've ever seen. Very nice pool area too.
They are timeshare condos, and are available at a discount directly from the owners. You have to go to websites like VRBO to accomplish this.< /Review>

<text>The condo was nice nothing special but the location was outstanding.  Wonderful dock that allows you to feel like you're out off shore and the water is so amazingly clear you can see the ripples in the sand from the motion of the water.  It's just magical.< /text>< pictures>

Fantastic lake side property with spectacular views, dock, swimming,  pool and hot tub. Rooms are quiet and clean equipped with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Arguably one of the premier Tahoe Vista lakefront properties. Value per dollar here is sky high! Stay here, I promise you wont be disappointed!<//review>

This is an excellent location to stay for an extended duration of time. It is conveniently located for both winter and summer activities. The lakefront access at a reasonable price really cannot be beat. It is best for families and not ideal if your desire is to have a rowdy party.</review>

The ladies working at the check-in counter were extremely nice and friendly!!!! The room was VERY nice!! Cozy, safe, warm and clean. We were CRUSHED however to learn upon checking in that the pool was closed. That was the whole reason i chose this hotel. they even show pics on their website of the pool open with snow around it. that is a MAJOR deception.</review>

I’ve been lucky enough to have been coming to Edgelake since I was a literal baby. There’s no where better on the North Shore in King’s Beach. Fun poolside area with BBQ’s, the absolute best staff, and gorgeous lakeside beach with dock and swimming platform. Dreamy summertime in Lake Tahoe 💗< /text>

It was a special occasion for my wife and we rented the lake view room which was priced more than a room without a view.  What a misnomer!! There was one chair inside the unit from which you had a peak view of the lake.  Ive become most adept usually at being able to ascertain ahead of time when the photo isnt really representative of the view.  In this case the photo was completely misleading.  The unit was clean, but dated.  Check-in was a bit of a mess too as the room was not ready at the designated time.  My biggest gripe, though, was a  very limited peak view on a room designated as a lake view room.</text>

Overall comfortable and pleasant.  Kitchen well-stocked with cooking and eating utensils, and fireplace provided a nice ambience.  Nice lake views from property.</Review>

Good location, comfortable room. Throughly enjoyed a week here with my family (including a 5 yo and 1 yo). Plenty of near by parks and the private beach gave space for my little ones to play in the fresh snow and on premise laundry room was very handy mid-week. I would recommend.< /Text>

I'm sure his place used to be nice some time ago, and it still has great potential being right on the lake, but there are obvious signs of wear and  mismanagement. Units need to he updated, wifi is weak, hot tub been out of service for over a month!!! Grounds are poorly maintained,  Buildings are old, with no sound proofing or insulation, old windows, you can hear the road and your neighbors... Cooking dishes and utensils are bare minimal...
Maid service non existent during your stay, only after you leave they come clean up...
Bedroom mattress is old, pull out sofa is even worse...</Review>

Management has clearly dealt with a lot of people trying to take advantage and the rules are very strict.  I've heard of some extreme challenges time share owners have faced, but once you get past the logistic issues the resort is lovely. Very convenient access to/from Truckee and Reno.  Beautiful and well maintained condos and public spaces with as private a beach and dock as one can legally get.<//Text>

This place has an old charm. Always clean, comfortable and for the most part, quiet. The exceptional view of the lake and a Pier with benches are an added bonus. It has a heated pool, hot tub, and new fire pit that extends enjoyment of a romantic, or family visit alike.< /review>

We've been staying here for years and would give all of those visits a FIVE STAR... always staying in #12 or #14.  This year we were place in #19 and for that reason I would give this stay only a ONE STAR.  The location of #19 is next to the office and the maintenance supply room.  Absolutely NO privacy as people walked by constantly, staring into our room.  The room was dark so at times we opened the front door and people would just walk in mistaken our room for a community room.  We had no personal chairs outside our room like the other rooms.  The roar of the street at night was terrible, you had to keep your window closed otherwise you were up all night.  We've never had these issues before, ever... always amazing and refreshed so my comments are just directed toward this unit location only.  We were pleased to see the updates to the property and as always other tenants were a pleasure to talk to each day and night.<//text>

The facility is pretty nice since it is right on the beach.  The rooms have been updated recently, but if you are a member here, just try and reserve a week.  It will usually take anywhere from 1 - 2 hours just to get on a waiting list.  They only have one line coming into the office and only one person taking reservations.  A very poor system.  It should be set up to always have the same week when you purchase at the property.  If that is what you want, then there is not the frustration of dialing and re-dialing forever to just get put on a waiting list.  NOT GOOD!! Sorry we bought in years ago to just be 10th on a waiting list.</review>

Great facility!  I've been going here for the last 30 years and the placement is amazing.  Right on the water with a great pier.  The hot tub overlooks the water and has a great fire pit sitting right to its side.  Beautiful.< /Review>

It's charming!!!  I love that is not trendy. It made my vacation seem like a get away.  The property and rooms are well maintained! Some people commented on the sound proofing and being woken up.  I ALWAYS  travel with a small fan fitter this reason.  Many hotels and such do not have the best sound proofing. The fan was plenty to block out noises of other guests.  Edgelake is lake side which is wonderful.  We saw bunnies,  geese and other birds while sitting on our porch drinking our morning coffee.  I will definitely stay here again!< /Text>< rating>

We've been going there since 2001. It is nothing but a great place to stay! We've been to a lot lake resorts and the way this one is set up makes it the nicest lake resort we've ever been to in our lives! There's a restraunt across the street and a GREAT, more than affordable grocery store beside that. The accommodations are FANTASTIC and you really can't ask for more than that! You gotta try it!<//review>

Pro's-
Right on the lake
4 Electric Grills (one was broke)
Pool & Hot tub (but were out of order many times during our week stay)

Con's-
There's only one washer for the entire complex. Plus, the house keeping's was broke so they were using ours.
The living room ceiling was under construction, they didn't bother completing their project before we arrived.
The pull out bed had springs poking out everywhere, VERY uncomfortable.
The bed was hard as a rock, I guess this is a pro for some :)
The pillows were flat.
No recycling available.
No outside night light, my Mom fell up the stairs because she couldn't see in the dark.<//text>

Edgelake is a great little place with a private beach, dock, pool, and activities. Its location allows for quick travel to Tahoe City and Incline with multiple restaurants and walking paths. Love going to Edgelake every year.< /Review>

What a wonderful surprise!! We stayed here through a VRBO listing and it was fantastic! Two couples and two children each had our own room. The kitchen allowed us to eat on site and we were able to socialize with other guests at the community BBQ's. The private beach, pier, pool, and playground were wonderful! We will definitely look to stay here again!</Text>

Great location beautiful surroundings. The units vary re upgrades and amenities. Some are nicer than others. They need to spend some time on maintenance outside. Paint needed, Beach cleanup needed, replace or repair broken lights and fixtures and some outdoor furniture is very worn out. A nice addition is the firepit and stone patio.</Text>

<review>On the bright side: gorgeous lake views and nice hot tub. Dated facilities. No soundproofing at all, everyone in my room was woken up by what sounded like some minotaurs and centaurs clomping around above us at the crack of dawn. Don't plan on the pullout bed being usable at all. The mattress was in tatters. I just put it back away and had to sleep on the couch.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Spent two nights at room 32, right on the water with a view to die for: Sierra snow peaks, pristine lake Tahoe, friendly staff, hot tub under the stars, deafeningly quiet setting with occasional sound from canadian geese in the distance. Perfect place to recharge.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>This place is AMAZING! I went there over the winter and it was awesome. It's quiet, you have the lake literally a minute or two. And it ACTUALLY feels like your at home. But people care about and will help at your service. It may be a little pricy. But trust me it's WORTH IT.< /review>< pics>

This was our first timeshare and one of our favorite places.  The staff was very helpful and courteous.  Also the other guests staying the same time we were there were also very friendly.  Just know that some people never have anything good to say....they just complain.< /Review>

The worst timeshare resort I have ever stayed at. The management was rude and unprofessional. It is outdated and the furniture and décor is just plain ugly. Our experience was so bad we left after three days. The only good thing about Edgelake Beach Club is the location on beautiful Lake Tahoe. But there are plenty of resorts and rentals on the lake. Would not recommend Edgelake !!< /review>

Rustic, quiet, peaceful just the place to sit by the lakeshore or on the dock and relax and unwind close to the Cusino if you want action and excitement. S king close by at incline or heavenly or sqawe valley!!</Review>

The barber was very talented, impressive, and professional. I loved the ambiance of the shop, it was clean, comfortable, and nice. The charges were extremely affordable and competitive. You are stunning.</Review>

I went in at 4:30 for a haircut only to be told that they were closed and I wouldn't be getting one. They had the door open, music blasting, a sign that said they were open. Their hours online say that they should have been open. Someone was in there getting their hair cut. He either lied to me or this business has horrible customer service. Obviously I won't be going back as I wasted a trip out there and wasted money on an Uber to get home, and they clearly don't want my business.<//Review>

Kaleb is the best barber in there. I was looking really bad and he got my self-esteem up. He is the youngest in there but the most creative with his cuts</Text>

Had a wonderful experience. I had an amazing haircut done by Peter which is the main one of the business. He is great go with him. He makes sure and tells you how you want it and does it exactly how you want it done. I'm going to keep on coming back to this Barber Shop and making sure that I go with Peter. I'm pretty sure the rest of them do an extraordinary job too just that I got Peter when I went.< /Text>

Young and chill barbers, but experienced and have been doing it for many years in the family business. I was on campus (USC) and needed a haircut for an interview the next day and these guys really came through! A safe and comfortable experience for a student who wants to look their best without breaking the bank.<//review>

<Review>Thanks to Adrian, I was so satisfied with the storage unit I purchased. Adrian made it a smooth transition.  I've had many storage units before & the one I purchase at Instorage is by far the best I've ever seen. If you're in the area & need storage space don't hesitate to check out this place. Thanks again Adrian.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dd4a97e3be03a5:0x9da9c382f13301e2< /GmapID>< user>

< Review>
I have been renting a storage unit from Instorage for a few months. It is Christmas time and needed to retrieve the tree, lights and Christmas decorations out of storage. The facility is very clean and very easily accessed. There are dollys to help transport your belongings. The personnel are friendly. The rates are super inexpensive as far as storage places go but the hours of access are limited. Plan you trips wisely and that is not an issue.< /Review>

I was helping a friend move and I noticed how clean the inside units are along with the hallways. They have a few portable carts to help one move in or out. They also have RV storage on the outside lot. The entry gate is code protected like most storage lots.</review>

The premises are clean and access is simple.

They do not accept cash. So you either opt for autopay or pay in person on the first.

Bring your own lock or purchase one there.

It's located across the street from Lowe's.</text>

My experience from start to finish was definitely satisfying. I initially spoke with Antwione on the phone. When I inquired about space availability, he followed through with everything he spoke about when I arrived to sign the rental contract. It's refreshing to experience no games.<//review>

They don’t value their old customers of many years. Constantly offer great deals & cut rate rent prices to new customers while raising the rent yearly for old customers. When I see their ads, I am embarrassed that I let it happen. We have been there for 11 years & now paying over $730.00 more per year than when we started. They know it is an ordeal to move so they have you “over a barrel”. You must give them a Declarations page from your Homeowners Policy yearly or they will add insurance to your monthly rent. Years ago, for some reason, I didn’t get notification of a rent increase. A few days after I paid my rent on time, they locked me out of the facility. I was clueless & they never notified me. Just locked me out.</Review>

< review>
Had a storage here. They lack cameras. Only a few outside. No cameras inside. I had a good lock on mine. And someone cut the bracket to get into my storage to steal my things. The cameras caught nothing. The torrance pd officer that did my case said they have constant break ins. Not to mention they dont help you with the insurrance claim. I been dealing with mine for months and they keep asking for a ton of paperwork. Wouldnt the police report be enough.<//review>

< review>
I tried to store several boxes with memorabilia from my dead husband in the storage I share with our son.  I was treated like a low down criminal, by a  very rude and nasty employee. I have not been treated this bad by anybody. My experience was devastating.</review>

<text>We needed a place to empty out a home while we found another place to live!
It was perfect place!
Large Clean Roomy and after we found our new place we were able to slowly move in sorting and separating what was to go to Salvation Army or into our home !
We are very pleased with the great size of storage and easy access and room to do what we needed to do!
Adrian was Excellent at checking us in showing us our options and working with our budget! Her Smile  Peaceful Joy was our number one blessing with all our craziness as we moved into our new journey! Mahalo “ Thank You” and. Aloha Ke Akua “God Is Love”<//text>< response>

< review>
I can always rely on her to get my hair cut done the way I need it to be. I call ahead to see if she's busy.  I like going in, getting my haircut done,  then leave; no fuss. She understands that and takes care of business right away.  I also like that she checks in to see if I need anything else before I leave.< /review>

I go here all the time but they expect you to pay cash and they don’t like it when you use your credit card and they always want tip which I think should only be about 3.00$. The haircut is ok< /text>

I liked this trail. It was a bit hard on the beginning, but then it became more or less flat. At the end you will be rewarded with the beautyful view of Lake Tahoe and the lakes behind the crest. Some snow patches today made the hike more enjoyable and fun :)<//review>

Beautiful hike, but get there early if you want a good parking spot. The trail gets a little crowded in the afternoon since you come back on the same trail, but take your time exploring the creek and Cascade Falls, there are plenty of little hidden gems all around. Also bring some lunch as there are plenty of places to hang out in the shade and enjoy the views while you eat.<//Text>

Recommend for sunrise/sunset hike as it's a short 3/4mi in and another 3/4mi out. Seems heavily tracked although I've only seen three people out there for my sunset hike. My favorite part was hanging out on a rock and sitting there with some folks but definitely go to the waterfall.

About the hike, it's not strenuous. Incline is steady. GOOD FOR KIDS. Be mindful driving to the trailhead. You drive through a campsite before reaching the parking lot.< /Text>

Was here and the views were amazing. The waterfall thats there doesn't actually run year round or much so it was disappointing to hike 40ish mintues to no waterfall.
However dont let that discourage you from going. Its breath taking.
What I would say though is make sure to use the restroom before driving in and to cool it on the water.
The restrooms are horrible. As in if I were to post a picture of it on here it would make you sick.
Let's just leave it at that.</review>

<Review>Cascade Falls was amazing. Huge water fall! (Hiked it end of June on a Monday). Took two kids 8 and 11 and they had a blast. Lots of boulders and rocks along the way, very fun!  This is an easy to moderate hike. Bring a snack or lunch to eat at the falls (trail ends above the falls, you see them as you hike in and out). 2 miles round trip.  Started at the trailhead 10 am done by Noon. Plenty of time left in the day to hit another site or activity. Parking is FREE but very small, go early.< /Review>< Pictures>

This is a great place to take a hike  To see the views . It is a tough hike up-and-down  Through rocky terrain. The views are great  Well worth the hike.</Review>

<review>Unparalleled views. Glad I went.  Even happier that I didn't give myself a heart attack.  Seriously, this trail is no joke!   Grades are steep and consistent ALL the way up.  Desolation Trail, you'd think the name would have given me a clue!!
Anyway, I am 55 years old and sedintary.   There was a woman up there looking for her dog.  She had already gone up and down the trail, and then JOGGED back up calling for her dog.  Wow,  she was a beast!!!!  So it's all relative to your fitness level.  Take water, for sure.   I wish I had sprayed bug repellent on my arms beforehand.  Otherwise, no regrets.  We went late in the day, no trouble parking or crowds. Nice!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<review>We hiked from here up to Maggies Peak, then down the other side to Eagle Lake, about 4 hrs total.

Great hike, INCREDIBLE views, a good uphill challenge. We left about 9 am, and saw very few people, until our descent. I highly recommend starting at Bayview and ending at Eagle - Eagle seems to be a lot steeper ascent. We were able to easily walk back to our car at Bayview.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Danielle Licht was a thorough professional in conducting the eye exam. I appreciate that she is freshly out of school (and a U of Michigan graduate as I, my wife and son are) with the latest knowledge. She gave the best advice for dry eye and I had excellent glasses made. The support staff was caring and very knowledgeable including the optical AND insurance departments. Highly recommend this group!< /Review>

<resp>None</resp><review>Great experience. The doctor really breaks down what best for your situation. Then the young women working the glasses made me feel comfortable about different styles and I needed getting two pairs because they were such awesome choices they present. They follow strict COVID-19 protocols and make sure everyone is comfortable and safe. 6 stars If I could.<//review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I want to show my appreciation to Kay Jung. I have eyes that have seen quite a bit of time, and she has treated me with professionalism, care, and grace. I cannot recommend her highly enough. Aces, top-of-the-line, thank you Kay.< /review>

<text>I have been going to Primary Eyecare Optometric for several years now and I have found it to be an exceptional office. From the friendly receptionists, who great you on the way in, to the technicians, who perform all sorts of eye tests quickly and thoroughly, to Dr. Dea, who expertly evaluates my eyesight and prescribes the perfect prescription for my needs, they all do so while also answering all my questions and even carrying on meaningful conversations! I'm especially grateful to Dr. Dea, who explains my scans in layman's terms each year; and in so doing, he also teaches me about my own eyesight and its progression. This time there were also additional sterile cleanings on each piece of equipment. It's always been spotless there, but now they have instituted even more systems to ensure there was a virus-free environment. I'm so impressed that I've recommended them to 3 friends and they are all going there, too. As you can tell, I'm a very satisfied patient.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

No explanation was given and I was only told someone would call to reschedule the appointment on the following Monday.
Monday came and went and there was no followup. I called and was greeted with an automated message that the office had been exposed to COVID-19 (Corona Virus.) This was never explained when my appointment was canceled nor was it communicated to me at a later point. DID PRIMARY EYECARE EVEN WARN THE CLIENTS THAT WERE EXPOSED? I can't be sure but their unprofessionalism would cause me concern.
Several days later and I still haven't been contacted about rescheduling.  Once again It was up to me to call the office and get a status update. The receptionist lied and said they were open Monday (even though they were letting an automated message do their dirt work that same Monday) And I had to pry what happened out of her. She said she would set up a new appointment for me... IN THREE WEEKS.
I understand there is a global pandemic and everyone is running a little short staffed or under duress. But it doesn't make sense that I should have to go nearly a month and a half without an appointment because of their mismanagement. Unless that particular optometrist is on available for two week because they have COVID (but I stress they didn't communicate this as an excuse) leaving me to only assume they just don't have the ability to accommodate me in a timely manner.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I actually LOVE my doctor here.  Great with me and my kiddo.  The eye doctor has always cause me a lot of anxiety, but I feel totally comfortable here.  However,  the front office staff needs some help.  I've never had a positive interaction with them.  I've been waiting for a month for my contacts, but apparently my mailbox was full.  So, they knew that I didn't get the message and never bothered to call back.  When they called to confirm my last appointment, my son was in the middle of a tantrum, so I asked them to call back.  Instead, they automatically cancelled my appointment, but didn't tell me.  So I showed up and was told I couldn't be seen that day.  Thankfully I pressed and they fit me in.  The only reason I stay here is because this is the first eye doctor where I haven't had extreme anxiety in the appointment.  Just wish the front office staff wasn't so rude and unhelpful.<//review>

I really appreciate how professional, clean and welcoming this office is. I have been going here for a couple of years, and the front desk is always very helpful when they check me in. I see Dr. Osias and he is really good about explaining every detail of what he is doing and whats going on with my eye. Overall good experience and got my contacts and glasses no problem.
Bonus: The fish tank in the waiting room is pretty cool :D</Review>

I have been with Dr. Osias at Primary Eyecare for many years.  I've depended on his careful attention and diagnosis to keep me seeing, even though I have optometric services through my HMO.  I was particularly impressed my last visit with the helpfulness and knowledge of the support staff this time.  I was in and out in an hour including a complete exam and glasses repair.</text>

I have been fortunate enough to have Dr. Osias as my Optometrist for a number of years.  Dr. Osias is like an old friend, and he treats me as such, he knows about my preexisting conditions and always keeps a watchful eye on my eye's and eye wear.
Normally, I see Dr. Osias for my annual eye exam, however this year I ran into a bit of trouble with my Primary Physicians request that I get an eye screening at Kaiser.  Kaiser "found" a problem with my eyes with the pictures they took. Not only did this put a good scare into me it also added a lot of stress to my world.
Dr. Osias was happy to recheck my eyes, and run a new Optomap series of images on my eyes even though I had a series of pics done in February at my annual check up.  Dr. Osias worked with me to figure out what Kaiser had likely seen. It turned out Dr. Osias had already seen the issue and was watching it. He collected data and drafted a note for the people at Kaiser, explaining his findings and the promise that IF my eye's developed a problem he would without hesitation direct me to the right people to get any corrective action taken.
I have loyalty to Dr. Osias, that only comes with years of working together, trust and mutual respect.
Primary Eyecare has been there for me when i was a cash paying customer as well as when I had insurance.  They have always tried to work with me to save money, and they are flexible in working around my schedule.
I would and will recommend Dr. Osias without any hesitation.<//text>

<Gmap_id>0x808f9188f0c70495:0x2fec3ed485010113<//Gmap_id><review>I saw a doctor in this office. Following the exam, I went to order the glasses I had already chosen while waiting for the exam, and was told that I needed a separate appointment to buy glasses. I drove down the road to Visual Insight, ordered glasses, and they have been my family's eye care provider since then.

It's now been a year. This office has apparently taken it upon themselves to schedule another appointment. I first received a phone call asking to change this appointment, which I never made, and I told them to cancel it. I then received a text confirming this appointment, which I never made, and I called and told them to cancel it. I have now received an email reminding me about the appointment, which I never made, with the warning, "Please note that we do not accept changes or cancellations via email." I regret having given them my contact information.<//review>< date>

Dr. Dea is wonderful! I've been a patient in his practice for almost 20 years. Dr. Dea is knowledgeable & always friendly and explains every process of the eye exam. I just love him! I do have to say some of his office staff is rude,  the front desk staff is good but the assistants really need to improve on their customer service. The last couple of years they tell you to come at a certain time to pick up glasses and then always cancel last minute saying they're not ready...kind of frustrating. Otherwise I am very pleased with Primary Optometrics. I also love the new location in Castro Valley. Kudos to Dr. Dea.<//review>

<Text>I've been going there for over 25 years when they had the old office in San Lorenzo. They had excellent customer service and great staff. My father is the one who introduced me to Primary Eyecare. Since then I have referred family members, friends, and co-workers due to great customer service and there professionalism. However, for the past 3-5 years it has gone downhill. All of the friendly and courteous staff is gone. I walk in for an adjustment and they say everything has to be done my appointment. I can understand if they are busy, but sometimes it'll be only myself sitting in the loby. I always paid cash and did not use my insurance because when you pay with cash they give you a two year warranty on your lenses and frames. I have used their services more then once in two years. All of a sudden, if you pay cash you only get one time exchange. Also, if you pay cash you only one exchange in two years. I asked to speak to the supervisor and she tells me this has always been their policy. I told that you have did this before where you exchange it for me past practice, and she said no. I told her to look at my file so she could see it. I asked to speak to the owner.  I was told she would replay the message and get back to me in a week, which he never did. I usually spend between $500-800 on a single pair of glasses every year at their office for my 3 kids and I, so I expect when there is a deep scratch or a problem with the frame they'll honor their product and their warrant. Unfortunately, this has changed. My dollar is good anywhere. Thereofore, I will not be purachsing glasses here for neither myself or family and will be informing my friends and coworkers about this policy change.</Text>< pics>

This place is a life saver! After going to The used Tire King and being turned away these guys were OPEN and Welcoming. Very helpful over the phone and in person. I do not live in Fontana or neighboring cities but my family does and I have recommended Willy's Tires to all of them! Great used tires for a great price very nice men working they speak Spanish also. They take cash and card. I will support this family owned business by continuing to purchase at Willy's Tires, thank you.< /text>

This is not my first time going to Willy’s. Today, my tire was severely punctured on the 15 Freeway, and thank God it happened near Willy’s Tires. They never disappoint! I made it in time just before they closed, and they very quickly took care of it. Owner also charged my dying phone while I waited, and we had a good conversation—truly, a great man and top notch service. Thank you!!< /review>

Great guys with plenty of used to new tires and space to pull right in and get the job knocked out. I bring a lot of my own cars and some friends' and am in and out in just a few minutes. Pretty sure even the big dealer auctions use them as will side I've seen some of their own cars here from time to time.< /Text>

<review>I had a flat tire with my rental car while I was visiting socal. Went to Willy’s after seeing the great reviews. They treated me great, showed me how big the hole in the tire was and sold me a good used tire for a very fair price and had me back in the road in no time. Very impressed with their service and work ethic< /review>< pictures>

< review>
I get diesel fuel here in the morning and sometimes grab something from the mini mart. Its well lit, clean and fully stocked with all you might need. Friendly sales staff. I don't know what else you would expect from a gas station, it is a well run business making every effort to keep the customers coming back.</review>

Pull into the store on March 15th 2020 and signs are posted that I must have a mask to enter the store. I have a mask so I enter the store and the employee is not wearing her mask. She has it but she says she doesn't want to wear it. The employees at this store are putting the public health and safety at risk the time is 1:06 p.m.< /text>

I love this place because they always have my favorite soda in stock, and I can't find it in most places even the big box stores. Very friendly and clean as well.< /Text>

Service was amazing and fast. I highly recommend coming to these guys to fix your phone. I liked that after my phone was fixed they made sure everything worked. I'm honestly so happy with the service they provide. I definitely will be coming back whenever I need to fix my phone or my kids phones.< /Review>

Sam helped my brother with his cracked phone. My brother cracked the front and back of his IphoneX (first generation). As soon as we walked in we did not have to wait more than 2 minutes when Sam greeted us and assisted us. Sam was very helpful and friendly. And May I add very knowledgeable. Not only is the service outstanding but the prices are unbeatable. We ended up paying half the other places. If you guys are in the area don’t get fooled by the vendors outside in the same mall go to “The Fix” on the second floor of the Northridge mall and ask for Sam to help you!!!< /Review>

The best place I have been to. The clerk is very nice and does a great job. I had my XR broken front and back and they left it like new. Much affordable than Apple Store and other competitors. They also threw in some freebies which makes them even better. I am very pleased No Wonder They Have 5 Stars with hundreds of reviews. Keep up the good work!! People remember and come back. I will recommend you to 10 people more.<//text>

I've needed to come in here several times over the last few years after dropping several different makes and models of phones. Every time they've been very nice to work with and have been able to turn around a repair while my wife and I peruse the stores at Westlake. Had to make another trip in today and I just wanted to recognize this store for its great customer service and expertise!</review>

I went to Sam to get my cracked screen fix on my iPhone 6s+ this morning & I couldn't be happier. I went to a few places to get the estimate and by far Sam got the most affordable rate. It was a bonus since my brother been to him before.< /review>

My husband came in to fix his iPhone 8 front and back screen. After coming in and fixing the screen the camera messed up, speaker wasn’t working , and it wasn’t touching properly. Had to come in again and same issues. Decided to order original - not their after market screen - and they couldn’t install it so we had to come in again. In the end we came in a total of 6 times the screen is still not the original Apple screen , the True Tone doesn’t work, the front view camera is blurry  and the viewing angles are not up to par with the original Apple screen.</Text>

A great experience I had today when I walked in the store . There were a nice lady that greated me from the entrance . I was totally amazed by the choice that i had. They have hundreds of nice cases and accessories. I got my phone fixed in 20 minutes and I got a good discount for a case a tempered glass protector . Also they gonna give 10 % off for the accessories next time . This is definitely best experience since I got my iPhone . I'll come again , I'll buy more . Thanks guys< /Review>

My daughter had dropped my phone and completely shattered my screen to where glass had chipped off. I had went to a few other places including UbreakIfix and they were going to charge $90 that’s if nothing else was wrong with the phone so I finally called The Fix and they only charged $59 I couldn’t beat that deal. Arrived and store was super clean and well stocked with cases and accessories. Was greeted right away by Sam. He was very nice to my husband and I. Service only took 20 min and on top of that inspected phone to make sure everything was working. They offer great deals there if you break your phone on a regular and really motivate you with perks to keep you coming back. Will use this place again and will refer for sure!< /review>

We stopped by this shop to check the prices and all and to my surprise they charge hella less compared to the others we had inquired. I got it fixed in minutes and its like new again! The employees are very helpful and i am more than satisfied with the work done.
5 stars and more to you guys!
P.s readers, buy yourself a screen protector too. They charge less and might give a warranty too.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUY39XYMbU89BxAet9IUoXS2e1ebshgKYs1z53=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>For iPhone users who need battery/screen/and so much more, THE FIX is the place!  The owner answers the phone even before they open.  The employees are kind, not aggressive and the work is warranted and costs much less than you know who/where would charge.

Leaving a gap that was big enough for me to put my nail in which means my phone is no longer water proof. They said it was because of the glue. They tried 3 times to fix it. I finally said fine and left only to find then had that my sim card wasn't in my phone. They put my sim card in and the sim card slot didn't work.

A great experience I had today when I walked in the store . There were a nice lady that greated me from the entrance . I was totally amazed by the choice that i had. They have hundreds of nice cases and accessories. I got my phone fixed in 20 minutes and I got a good discount for a case a tempered glass protector . Also they gonna give 10 % off for the accessories next time . This is definitely best experience since I got my iPhone . I'll come again , I'll buy more . Thanks guys< /Review>

<text>The Fix Phone repair inside the Northridge mall has the best phone screen repair prices in Northridge. I was on vacation and I went to the Northridge mall and I saw the store located in the second floor and I asked the price to repair my ixr , the price was really cheap! They fixed it in less than 30 minutes and Nicole (an employee) was very helpful putting on a glass screen protector for me! I’m leaving satisfied and with a new phone screen. :)</text>< userid>

First I went to uBreak iFix and they wanted nearly $300 to rebuild my Samsung S9 to fix a stuck volume button. They said they had to basically restore it to like new, which included replacing the screen.

I then found The Fix. Sam was great and within an hour my button was fixed without a complete rebuild of the phone. Including the protective case I purchased,  I was out the door for about $125.< /text>

I dropped my friends LG g4 phone while playing a prank, and he had no screen protector on so the screen cracked big time (as you see in the picture). We stopped by this shop to check the prices and all and to my surprise they charge hella less compared to the others we had inquired. I got it fixed in minutes and its like new again! The employees are very helpful and i am more than satisfied with the work done.
5 stars and more to you guys!
P.s readers, buy yourself a screen protector too. They charge less and might give a warranty too.</text>

They helped me fix my phone multiple times and every time they came back they were always kind and helpful. I especially appreciated the little candy they had available at checkout. I would highly reccomend this store to anyone who needs their phone repaired with quality parts for a low price.< /Review>

I dropped my phone while at work and decided to check this place out. The Fix really caught my attention in the Northridge Fashion Center because it was so bright and clean. The clerk George was very helpful and fixed my phone within the hour for a reasonable price. I also decided to get a case from them to protect my phone. Very pleased with the experience. Absolutely will be coming to them if my phone breaks.< /Text>

The guys here are really friendly and helpful. I came in for a screen protector for my iPad and they did a great job plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. They also have a great selection of phone, iPad covers and accessories.< /text>

I began having difficulty charging my phone so I brought it in assuming I would need a new battery. The rep took a quick look at my phone, cleaned out the charging port, and now it charges like brand new. I was very impressed by The Fix because they easily could have charged me for a new battery if they wanted to.</text>

I walked in the fix all the employees were very welcoming, Debora helped me in picking a case that was PERFECT for me. I really liked the service she provided because she gave me her opinion and which case provided the most protection. Really recommend this store, ask for Debora!!!< /Review>

<userid>116917336745646626095</userid><text>First off I have to say their customer serives is awesome. I was shown much needed kindness and generosity by Bleu and George. For my phone died and I was in a city I did not know very much about, I didn't know how to get home. Long story short I had a very hard day and found my way to their store. And they helped me out in charging my phone. They were all very patient with me and other customers. As I waited there I saw them attending their customers with such attentiveness. From over hearing a woman that was basically the middle woman in her situation. Taking her husband's phone in for repairs. She was not having a very good day from the sounds of it and George was very patient with her as well. Not that she was out of line or anything but she just wanted to get home as well. But as I stood there I was able to realize they fix phones, computers, and tablet. And even hover boards from over hearing a conversation. They have so many accessories for your phone and much more. So even though I wasn't there to buy anything or a repair. I was able to witness their service skills and I was very pleased to have met Bleu, George, and Alex as well.

It was raining and I got out of my car, but I accidentally dropped my phone! It was really hard to see due to the cracks so I had to get it fixed ASAP! I looked at my nearest phone repair shops and found The Fix. The employees were super friendly and helped me every step of the way. They fixed it super quick! My new go to store!<//review>

I had some problems with my phone . I've been charging the phone 100 % , but it last only for 2 hours . The guys from this store offered me a free diagnostics, and in less than 15 minutes i got a new battery replaced . Now i can spend more time on social networks :)) .
Because i changed the batterie i got 10 % off , for this termo case . Love this store. 5 stars from me .< /Review>

I left a deposit so they could order the part. Once it was there they called me and fixed it within 2 hours. Now it's as good as new. This will be my to go place to fix any broken screen on a phone.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) I went to change the screen on my iPhone 11 phone they told me the price $ 169 they never told me it was a false screen I realized when I couldn't use Face ID afterwards and then the screen didn't have much touch I also got dark the screen for a long time and didn't turn on the phone I went where they changed the screen they did but I realized for themselves that the screens are non-original screens. I do not recommend this place because I honestly think that from the beginning as a customer they would have told me the product they were selling me more, however they did not, I found out in the Apple store and the screen costs $ 200 and it is original so I think it is better not come to this place where nothing else will ruin your phone

Fui a cambiarle la pantalla a mi teléfono iPhone 11 me dijeron el precio $169 nunca me dijeron que era una pantalla falsa yo me di cuenta cuando ya después no podía usar el Face ID y luego la pantalla no tenía mucho tacto también se me quedaba oscura la pantalla por un largo tiempo y no encendía el teléfono fui donde ellos a que me cambiaron la pantalla lo hicieron pero me di cuenta por ellos mismos que las pantallas son pantallas no originales. Yo no recomiendo este lugar porque sinceramente pienso que desde el principio como cliente me hubieran dicho el producto que me estaban vendiendo mas sin embargo no lo hicieron averigüé en la tienda de Apple y la pantalla cuesta $200 y es original entonces yo pienso que es mejor no venir a este lugar donde nada más te van a arruinar el teléfono< /text>
