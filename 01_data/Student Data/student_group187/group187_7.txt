<rate>5</rate><Review>I've been here twice and received excellent customer service. On my second visit, a panel underneath my front bumper got loose and was dangling and scraping the road. Diamond Auto Body was able put it back in for me free of charge since it was super minor work. Super friendly staff, clean facility. I was very comfortable here both times and this will be my first choice auto body shop in the future.<//Review>< resp>

<review>Bad communication when I'm there or during phone call.

Run don't walk away, not sure the owner knows what's going on in his business.  They build AAA for a new part, used a used part, it went bad and caused over a thousand dollars in damage, had extra work done wish we had used a check to pay for the extra work. I prefer giving praise.<//Text>

I would give more stars if I could! Took my car in to have some work done, and they did a great job. Aside from the top quality work, I also appreciate their dedication and honesty to costumer service. Not to mention that Arthur and Peter provided me with regular updates and had my car looking like new. Highly recommend Diamond Auto Body &  Paint!!!</Review>

<review>Hello everyone
I’m taking the time to write this review because this body shop did an awesome job with my BMW.  I’ve never seen so much good detail done to a car.  The bottom line you want to get your car done right take your car to Diamond Auto Body.... 5 star service!

I wanna give a special thanks to Mary,  really showed a lot of professionalism.

Thanks< /review>< Pictures>

My 4 year old son thought it would be a good idea to spray paint my husband's truck black. It was only a couple spots but it still was obvious. I took the truck to diamond and they had it fixed within 20min. Yiu cant tell there was ever black paint on it. Diamond auto body was polite, professional and knowledgeable. We will forever be customers of Diamond auto body and will continue to refer them to evwryone</Text>

My daughter was driving my car. Got hit by an illegal alien and destroyed my right rear wheel assembly. No insurance of course. Took the car here and they did a pretty good job of fixing the door. However the right rear suspension wasn’t tightened properly. So spent more money to get it done right.<//Text>

I've been to a few places to get random repairs done to my vehicle and these guys did an amazing job and on top of that the price was really reasonable to fix my Subi.Thank you very much!!!
Also I'm pretty sure with as many careless drivers on the road now a days.You can bet I will bring my cars there every time.Thanks again Danny and your team!< /text><gmap_id>0x8094681a1b3be579:0x4d78a25569685dce< /gmap_id>< userid>

My company's truck got a dent on its side and I needed it to be fixed asap. Diamond Auto Body fixed it completely and did an impeccable job. I will for sure be a returning customer.<//review>

Great work doesn't happen quickly.  I would rather have a job take a couple extra days than not be done well.  Diamond does fantastic work, better than factory!</Text>

It is hard to find a company whom you can trust to give excellent service and will not cheat you. We have been fortunate enough to find Diamond Auto Body. My husband and I have gone to Diamond Auto Body for three separate occasions - once for a new windshield, and twice for auto body work. They have gone above and beyond, coordinating with the car rental company and the insurance company. Besides the excellent customer service we received there, the work on our vehicles was impeccable. We will not trust our vehicles to any other auto body company.

I must add - the three cars they have worked on are a 2001 Ford F150, a 2005 Scion XB, and a 2014 Toyota Rav 4 - all of which do not even total $75,000. I was still treated with the same respect as the people with the fancy cars.

I want to end with an observation that speaks to their customer service - the other day I saw an accident not too far away from the business. I saw one of the employees helping a gentleman push his car to the side of the street away from main traffic. I don't know too many companies who would do that, especially in the heat.<//Text>

Their management and workers are all professional, I watched some of them working on the car and they clearly knew what they were doing. Got the job done early and at a great price for the workmanship<//Text>

I took my car to Diamond Auto body after my brand new 2017 Audi was rear-ended on the Friant off-ramp of HWY 41.  After getting hit, I had a lot of bad feelings about getting the car repaired because the car was brand new, and I had felt that nobody would be able to fix it correctly. I was totally wrong. The guys at Diamond Auto Body had my car back to factory-looking conditions. After my car was repaired here, my dad had some body issues with his car and he went here. His car came out of the shop looking brand-new like nothing ever happened.
I would recommend these guys to anyone, and I will be bringing my car back here for any issues I have in the future. They get things done right the first time around.<//Text>

<Date>1513731441530</Date><text>Waited 2 months to get my car in this shop to repair a scratch on my back bumper and trunk. Took a week and a half to get it done. Never called me to update on the progress. I finally walked in to find out the status of my car. Told they were still waiting on a part but would be done by 4:30. Here I sit at 4:55 waiting for them to finish "washing my car". And now my bill is $200 more than quoted. I'm really disappointed.<//text><rate>1< /rate>< userid>

Many years ago I was experiencing some health issues so I went to Dr. Kelly.

Based on the Total Body Modification, Bowen Therapy, and Active Release Techniques (A.R.T) she recommended tons of supplements.  After only one week of taking the supplements my health went from bad to worse.
I told Dr. Kelly about these new symptoms that I was experiencing. She dismissed it immediately and she insisted that it had nothing to do with the supplements. After two weeks my health declined so badly that I was bed ridden.

It has taken me many years to bounce back.
The supplement she recommended ruined my health! But profited her pocket.
Please do your own research before you take any supplements.
She is not a patient advocate!<//review>

I was seeing a different chiropractor and developed lower back pains while being a client.  Having seen Dr. Kelly and my current chiropractor at the same health fair and having had her free evaluation I thought I'd try her again even though her location was slightly less convenient.  Dr. Kelly addressed my lower back pain immediately and after a couple dozen visits I'd swear by her treatments.  My back is noticeably better.  Thank you Dr. Kelly.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The first day I stepped into Kelly’s office, I had suffered with neck, shoulder pain for weeks and constantly wake up in the middle of night in pain that has affected my day work and life quality.

Dr. Kelly not only helps to treat my neck and shoulder pain. She also helps to check my home working environment photo and recommend me to level up my monitor, padding the chair cushion so my neck, shoulder and elbow could be in the best position when I am working. For someone who has to sit in front of computer and working 10+ hours, her recommendation helps to reduce my neck pain greatly just within a week.

From having problem raising my arm over my shoulder, suffer in pain just taking a t-shirt off or scratching my back. I could do these daily routines without issue now. I am following doctor’s instruction to do daily exercise to train my shoulder muscle and should be able to get to my old self soon!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1575324027537, 'text': "Thank you for the amazing review, Jenny!

<Time>1567531729253</Time><Review>I am grateful to Dr Kelly, she definitely knows what she’s doing. I had an injury happen in my neck while my normal chiropractor was out of town. Dr Kelly was able to help me to be able to gain mobility again, I am so thankful because I was in so much pain before.

To be clear, I respect that each chiropractor has their own choice on how they run their practice. The reason I am giving only 3 star rating is because  I personally like a more hands on approach to chiropractic. Dr Kelly mainly uses the Activator tool to do most adjustments (from my observation from my  one visit). Also during my visit my ankle was hurting from a sprain that happened a couple weeks before and when addressed Dr Kelly tried to help it get better by adjusting it with said tool and I feel like it made the pain worse and  still days later thinking I need to let this injury heal all over again.

I am not upset, I genuinely feel like she was trying to help, her technique is just not my preference.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fb5a1b1671b79:0x1ec68ec0b1b1e846< /gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp></record>

I had a recent fall and hurt my back. I had never been to a chiropractor. Dr. Kelly was so friendly, informative, and explained everything thoroughly. I’m back to feeling my normal self with the help of Dr. Kelly. Her staff is also amazing Yuni & Beth & Briana are all friendly and very helpful. I enjoy coming into this office.<//Text>

<review>I first met Dr. Kelly and her staff at the Spring Forward 5K/10K run in Mountain View in 2015.  At that time, I had a concern about chiropractic care because people that I knew who regularly saw a chiropractor seemed "addicted" to it:  that is to say that at times they didn't feel right unless they saw the chiropractor regularly.  I didn't want to get into a codependent habit.  I figured if I stretched, stayed limber, got a massage once a month and just did common sense things, I would never need to.

But I was all to happy to get the free 15 minute massage that their booth offered and leave it at that.

Later that same year, I experienced actual shoulder and back pain that wouldn't go away.  And I realized that I was just medicating it with pain killers and waiting for it to go away, like you would when you see your personal physician.  That didn't seem healthy either, and I didn't want to get to the point where more powerful muscle relaxants would be needed.  I figured I would give it a shot, and trust my own willpower to discipline myself to only go when I needed to.

But upon visiting her office and meeting her staff, I was shown the videos and learned about vertebral subluxation and its effects.  And through the process, my first experience of being adjusted, and the way that the pain was actually treated instead of waited out, I came to understand the value and purpose of chiropractic and its preventative benefits in avoiding bigger, more painful, and more expensive orthopedic medicine.

When the pain went away, I stopped going just as I planned.  Personal care isn't necessarily cheap:  grooming, pampering, hobbies or activities.  I wanted to only invest what I needed in what I needed.

But through the journey, I also developed a more active lifestyle.  Not that I became a gym rat, but free of pain I found myself being more outdoorsey.  And in the course of time, I developed pain again.  Over time I'd experienced pain (although less severe) from doing stuff:  playing golf, or riding my bike more after not riding for a while and having back pain from being hunched over handlebars, or stiffness from maintaining posture when I rollerblade for the first time in months.  But then, I found myself lifting stuff and doing stuff while cleaning my storage and my apartment, and tweaked my back to where it was actually painful.

And I went back to Dr. Kelly, and once again the pain was treated.  And now I understand the reality of what I used to fear.  Maintenance is less painful than remediation; and in the long run less expensive.

So today it is part of my personal care regimen.  I've adjusted my FSA and chosen my open enrollment to more easily accommodate the healthy habit.  If I tweak something while doing my normal stuff, it is caught early and treated early before it becomes seriously painful or expensive to treat with therapy or medications.

That perhaps speaks to the value of chiropractic care, but then becomes the question of choosing a practitioner that works for you.  Here's where Dr. Kelly and her staff really shine.  Between being both knowledgeable, professional, and personable I have found them to be the perfect partners in maintaining my health.  I had developed the mentality, when I got over my fear of going to doctors or dentists, that what works best for me is to have teammates in maintaining my wellness.  I really do feel like we're on the same team.  When it has been prudent or necessary to re-evaluate practitioners based on my insurance network coverages and whatnot, this is one concession I would not make.

Realities have forced me to change primary care physicians before, when my employer's insurance programs differ.  I've always been dissatisfied with that process.  And so in this case, where I see the chiropractor more times per year than my primary care physician, it doesn't make sense to me to roll the dice.

And so fast forward four years, I can say that I am happily a patient of Dr. Kelly; and I have no fear of doing things knowing that I've got teammates on my side.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1575330414303, 'text': "Thank you so much for sharing your experience, Alvin!

I was in a severe auto accident a couple of years ago and went to at least 10 different chiropractors and none of them seemed to help. My daughter started going to Dr. Kelly and referred me to her clinic, so I decided to give it another shot. I was in so much pain that I was not able to turn my head at all or walk around more than an hour without having intense pain in my lower back. After being treated at Dr. Kelly’s for about a month, my pain has decreased immensely! I am able to turn my head with no problems and my lower back feels so much better! I went Black Friday shopping with my daughter and was able to walk around Valley Fair for 6 hours with no pain in my lower back! I’m so glad I gave chiropractic another chance and went to see Dr. Kelly. I feel like I have my life back again!<//review>

Dr Kelly & her team have really helped me be able to laugh as much as I want without the back of my head hurting so much. It hurt alot when I would crack up laughing to the extent I stopped letting myself have a good time just to keep from the pain laughing caused. They did ultra sounds & adjustments on my neck & head on a routine basis until I got to the point of it not hurting if I laughed. It feels real good to be able to have a good time again. Thank You Dr. Kelly & Thank You to her Team< /Review>

Dr. Kelly and the staff is amazing. They are all extremely knowledgeable and professional. I enjoy going to my appointments and I learn something every time I go. I use to suffer from tendonitis on my left arm a few years ago where it was really hard to move it. Medical doctors recommended me to take a load of medicine or do surgery which I was not comfortable doing. Through word of mouth, I was recommended to Dr. Kelly to help heal my arm. She not only healed my arm but also my entire well being. Thank you so much Dr Kelly and all of the staff there for taking care of me!<//review>

She treats her patients with utmost care. My husband and I sought chiropractor treatment a week after our car was rear ended. We came to her clinic with severe neck ,shoulder and lower back pain. In a short time, my husband was immediately released from the treatment and was back to work healthy and pain free. Meanwhile, I am still undergoing treatments and she has helped tremendously to alleviate my chronic lower back pain. Within 5 sessions, she was able to relieve my knee problems and it was completely healed! We will definitely be returning for maintenance care. We also appreciate the warm welcome that her staff at the front desk (Beth) extends to us each time we visit the clinic. Dr. Kelly's personable expertise is worth recommending! Five stars to Dr, Kelly!!!!

<Text>This is my story; I was in my late 30's I was depressed, moody and had really bad anxiety. I felt suicidal. The doctor diagnosed me with a chemical imbalance and prescribed Paxil for me. It helped but as the years went on I didn't want to be on it all my life, so I tried getting off of it numerous times. The doctor would slowly wean me off but my body had bad withdrawals, anxiety, and mood changes and irritability and I felt like  crawling out of my skin.  I had to get back on it. I finally accepted the fact in order to live a normal, stable life I would have to rely on Paxil the rest of my life. I'm now in my late 50's and I'm going through menopause. With that and the Paxil combined I've gained weight and no matter how much I work out and eat healthy the weight doesn't come off.  I started feeling depressed, tired and I had no energy to work out. After work I would come home and go to sleep. It started to affect my marriage and I started to give up hope. Then I heard about Dr. Kelly and how she treated, family members and friends for different situations. I was hesitant because in the past when I tried getting off Paxil it didn't work. I thought well maybe it can't hurt, so I started seeing Dr. Kelly in May I told her my situation and she was caring, concerned and compassionate.  Dr. Kelly started me on a treatment and it's been 3 months now and I feel great! I have energy and the depression has diminished. She started weaning me off the Paxil and in my past experience the first week when I would try to get off it I would get fuzzy and irritable, anxious and crawling out of my skin. It was awful and had to get back on it. Not this time. I was like wow!! This is actually working. My husband even sees the difference in my personality and appearance.  I still have a ways to go, but I feel confident and know with Dr. Kelly's help I will finally be able to get off Paxil and live a normal healthy life. I highly recommend going to Dr. Kelly. She is an amazing, beautiful talented woman and very intelligent. She knows what she's doing. The staff is friendly and their service is excellent and professional.

I've been coming here for about two years now and my final appointment is coming up soon. I've never felt better. Dr Kelly is attentive to wherever you're pains and she knows how to fix you up in an instant. I wish I could continue coming for treatment because I tend to not sleep properly and the treatments always fix that. I'll definitely start coming back when I have more time! I gotta stay in good shape.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Kelly is very knowledgeable, kind and very involved in every aspect of the treatment. I was suffering with neck and lower back pain for more that 10 years, and after only 4 sessions  treating my neck and middle back the pain has been decreasing and I feel great! Dr. Kelly will continue with the treatment of my lower back. I feel that my quality of life is improving and pain is gradually getting less intense. I highly recommend Dr. Kelly.

Had hurt my lower back to the point where I couldn't bend to wash my face. I was recommended to Dr. Kelly so I decided to check it out. So far, had a couple visits and she has helped me get my range of motion back. Check this place out if you're having any back pains. She'll explain thoroughly of what the root cause may be.< /Review>

I got into a car accident and went to a really bad chiropractor for about month before discovering Kelly. At this time I had already built up a lot of scar tissue, but Kelly has helped me heal in every session with her. She made sure that I left feeling better, if not, she would continue working on me! Another great aspect about this clinic is that they also teach you all about your bones and muscles to help you understand your own body. They truly care about you and your wellness. This is the place to go for all your chiropractic needs :)< /Review>

Dr. Kelly is very professional. I started seeing her for back ache mostly experienced at work. After a few treatments with her, I have noticed a great difference with my back. It does not ache as much and I sleep better at night too.

I also like the fact that Dr. Kelly and her staff take the time to explain what Chiropractic is all about and how the spine is an integral part of keeping the body in alignment to prevent further injury.

I totally recommend her practice.</Text>

I'm a fairly new patient and already I've gotten so much relief in my back and neck. I took a bad fall a couple of years ago and didn't realize the extent of the injuries until recently when I was experiencing what I thought was tension in my back and neck. After a couple of treatments, I realized what I was feeling wasn't just "normal" tension.  Dr. Kelly also advised me on exercises that would support my treatment program. I'm feeling much more relaxed, less fatigued and my posture is improving without having it feel tight or unnatural. I always look forward to my treatments.< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><pics>None<//pics><text>I had been to a highly recommended chiropractor for years.  But when my sciatic pain was non-stop and prevented me from sleeping at night I tried my friend’s chiropractor.  He too was highly recommended.  But I felt very little improvement.  I then turned to google and found Dr. Kelly near my work in Cupertino.  Believe the reviews; she is great!  After one visit with Dr. Kelly, I was able to sleep through the night!  She set up an MRI for me and found my lower back was in worst case than I thought.  But under Dr. Kelly’s care I improved with each visit.  My sciatic nerve pain reduced to tingling in my calf to completely normal after a month of treatment.  I highly recommend Dr. Kelly especially if you are suffering from nerve pain.<//text></record>

< review>
I've been seeing Dr. Kelly for about 10 years now.  I've seen her for neck and back issues from car related injuries, sprains from training for half marathons and for nutrition consultation which has made me feel healthier by feeling more energetic, lose weight, and have more endurance to run faster half marathons.  I was referred by my older brother who has been seeing Dr. Kelly even longer than I have.  Most of my family see Dr. Kelly because she is very knowledgeable, kind, educational, and great at what she does.  I recently sprained my foot and was hoping it would get better on its own, which of course it didn't, so I was limping for about a month before seeing Dr. Kelly.  When I finally saw Dr. Kelly, I was able to mobilize my foot as soon as she adjusted it which was necessary for me to live my active lifestyle.  I recommend Dr. Kelly to anyone.  Her office even has massage therapy which is great because you can get your muscles loosened before getting an adjustment which makes the adjustment a lot easier and last longer.< /review>

I first came to Dr. Kelly for sciatic nerve problems. I had gone to my regular doctor numerous times and her response was always to strengthen my core muscles. I did not know that I had a back problem, so her recommendation never worked.

When I came into Dr. Kelly's office, within two weeks it was 75% better. It is stabilized now.

I recently was in a car accident and sprained my ankle. All my regular doctor could tell me to do is to ice it and keep it elevated. After 3 and a half weeks, my ankle was still swollen and I could hardly walk on it. Within a week of coming to Dr. Kelly most of the pain was gone and I was able to walk.<//text>

I was at a City gym open house, when Dr. Kelly's staff member Beth did some posture tests, And found that I needed some help.  That was very lucky for me because I did not even know I had some issues. Which would have become much worse as the years go by.  Sometimes I see people who are bent way over,  and I think that if they only had seen Dr. Kelly some years ago they would not be like that now.  In addition to providing  posture benefits, I am almost certain that she improved my golf game. And most likely helped in overall wellness, such as better blood flow etc. Dr. Kelly is an unusually pleasant person; and her staff including Beth and Brittany are also friendly people.<//Review>

<review>I play tennis and badminton regularly, couple of months ago I got the tennis elbow problem and also I sprained my wrist badly and the sprain got so bad I could not even type, my work requires a lot of typing so it also put a lot strain to wrist. I did a quick search and found Kelly Chiropractic and Wellness center, I was able to get the appointment quickly and they are very flexible. I meet Dr Kelly and she did full check on my problem and explained my situation perfectly and described history of the problem and also she explained the importance of routine checkup and how to take care of my wrist problem. It was a wonderful experience taking to her. After three visits I was back to normal and from sixth weeks onward I was able to play for close to hour and half with any discomfort. She is awesome and his support staff remarkable, in total it was fantastic experience..!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fb5a1b1671b79:0x1ec68ec0b1b1e846< /GmapID></record>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I have been getting wrist pain for years and it got more prevalent through out college and as I found jobs that required me to sit at a desk all day. I would usually just wait out the pain. Some times it would go away in a few hours and other times it would take days of tylenol and less use of my arms to feel better.

Dr. Kelly was able to identify what was wrong with my wrist immediately. It was actually a muscle near my elbow! She used an ultrasound treatment to get my muscle to heal properly and advice on how to take care of myself better. She even told me the right arm brace to buy to give support.

I also just ended the detox program and I am feeling great. Before the detox program, I was constantly exhausted, had headaches nearly every other day, and I was at least 10lbs over weight. The detox made it easy to change my eating habits. I haven't been tired or had headaches since I started. I also lost 5lbs within the first two weeks! I would definitely recommend this.

Dr. Kelly is also super nice. Her clinic is pretty and really clean. Major + all around!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Dr. Kelly is truly a life saver! Not only is she the sweetest person EVER, she really cares for all of her patients. I have a lot of nerve damage in my arm and happened to see Dr. Kelly's office on my way home one day. I was in so much pain and almost in tears as I told her my symptoms. The office was closing in 5 minutes when I walked in and Dr.Kelly stayed late to help me with my arm. I have been coming to Dr. Kelly frequently for the past 2 weeks and not in nearly as much pain as I was. I feel a little better every time I leave her office. I would recommend her to anyone!<//Review>

I went here after a car accident and whiplash injury. After a series of sessions, my pain in the mid back and neck completely stopped.

Friendly staff and experienced  massage therapists.

I would definitely recommend to go for chiropractic sessions to ease your muscle stiffness and lifestyle.< /Text>

This year, I ended up with not one, but TWO pinched nerves in my neck, near the base of the skull, which has been very painful.  Dr. Kelly not only remembered me, she remembered who referred me to her and it's been just as great an experience.  Her staff is also totally awesome!

I'll always recommend Dr. Kelly to anyone who asks!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fb5a1b1671b79:0x1ec68ec0b1b1e846</gmap_id></record>

I have been going to Dr. Kelly for few weeks and I am feeling 75% better with my back and neck pain. If your in pain or constant bothersome you should come see her. She's really professional and her staff as well and they all make you feel welcome every time you go in.< /Review>

I have been here for at least half a year and Doctor Kelly has helped me with my mom, dad, and brother. Now I don't wake up with back pains or neck pains. Doctor Kelly and the staff were very nice to me. During my basketball season, I jammed my fingers and thanks to Doctor Kelly my fingers are no longer jammed and I can continue to play the sport I love. My volleyball season is coming up so I'll probably be visiting Doctor Kelly again.</Review>

I have been suffering from sharp pains in my back for over a year and I have always had a weak back that caused me to slouch a lot. I have been diagnosed with scoliosis which is the cause of my pain. After going to Dr Kelly's, my back has been feeling much better. I can use a lot more muscles in my back without pains constantly jabbing at my back all day and would definitely recommend Dr Kelly to others. :)<//Text>

I've never trusted chiropractors - a well respected physician terrified me of them when I was in my early 20's. About a year ago I met Dr. Kelly's team at an event that my job sponsored and I decided to check them out. As someone who has dealt with long term back pain, that has never been properly addressed by general physicians, I decided that maybe doctors didn't have all the right answers after all. Taking a leap of faith with Dr. Kelly has been the best thing I've ever done. A year later and my back has never felt better. I look forward to my weekly visits and have developed genuine friendships with the office staff. I also recently experience a strained muscle in my back and an urgent care doctor sent me away with meds and some printouts of stretches. I called Dr. Kelly the same day and she made room for me due to the severity of my injury. She saw me two more times the same week and made sure I was properly treated without the need for muscle relaxers. I love this place!<//text>

I began having migraine headaches after being free of them for many years.  After a few treatments from Dr. Kelly, I am now free of them.  Even the stress of travel to Dallas to teach did not bring them on again.  I am very grateful.< /Review>

Dr Kelly has been my go-to doctor for almost everything since 7 years ago. From neck and back pains to headaches and chest pains,  she is always able to give me instant relief after her adjustment on me.  she also showed me the importance of spinal health to overall wellness. I would totally recommend her to everyone.</Review>

I went to Dr. Kelly at least once a week for 6 months and my pain did not get any better, not to mention I was paying almost  $400 a month! I spent almost $3000 to get "treated", and I still had to pay over $300 to get out of my contract. Don't waste your time or hard earned money on this place.< /Review>

<review>Met the friendly staff at a local community event. Met Dr. Kelly and had a consultation where she reviewed my aches and pains and worked with me (and within my insurance limits) on a treatment plan. Have only had a few appointments, but things are already markedly better. My chronic lower back issues and more recent neck issues already feel better.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<text>Approximately, 6 months ago I had lower back pain and pain in my right rib cage. The pain in my back caused me to have problems walking without pain. The problems with my rib cage caused me to have sharp pain when I took deep breaths or when I tried to do any physical activity.
After each weekly visit there was improvement in my ability to walk with less pain and after a few weekly visits I was able to walk without pain. The same with the rib cage injury. I was able to breath without pain. Being older (82) I was having problems with the strength in my legs from the knees to the ankles. Dr. Kelly started to focus her attention to these areas about 4 weeks ago and each time I go there I have witnessed improvements in my ability to do things that involve my leg muscles. Dr. Kelly has found the right areas to probe and she follows this up with the special stretch bandaid material that is used on athletes for these kinds of injuries. I highly recommend anyone who has a back problem or other physical issues to make an appointment with Dr. Kelly.  John Husher<//text>< Time>

<Text>I had severe sharp stabbing pain in my head triggered every few seconds back in April 2012.  Prior to visiting Dr. Kelly, I visited acupuncture doctor twice with intensive treatment and the symptom did not get any better.  I was told that it could become stroke.  That is a shocking and scary news to me.  After suffering the weird and unbearable pain for 3 days, I decided to visit Dr. Kelly whom my husband has visited for several years.  Dr. Kelly is very experienced and patient.  As soon as I described the symptom to her, she got the idea of the root cause.  The root cause is my cervical vertebra is not straight which would press the nerve then triggers the pain every few seconds.  Dr. Kelly suggested to have intensive treatment three times a week.  I gave it a try.  I felt much better at the first day I got the treatment.  After doing for two more treatments, the stabbing pain was completely gone.  I was so happy and relieved.  In order not to have the pain come back, I continued to have the regular visit to improve my neck problem.  It's been almost 10 months, the stabbing pain problem never comes back(keep fingers crossed).  Moreover, I am able to sleep better.  (I used to have problem to sleep few days before menstrual cycle starts).  This is the bonus I have never expected.  I really appreciate the treatment I received from Dr. Kelly.  I would recommend to anyone who has the similar symptom as mine before.  You can really feel the difference.  What is better than this without taking any medication?<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fb5a1b1671b79:0x1ec68ec0b1b1e846<//GmapID></record>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr. Kelly for about 4 to 5 months now and I must say my back is feeling so much better. I have scoliosis and it would give sharp pain in my lower back. Dr. Kelly knew exactly what to do to make my back feel alot better. I work in a operation center and I sit most of my day. Before seeing Dr. Kelly, I would not go through a whole day without sharp pain all over my back but now I can go through the whole day and work out with no pain at all. I also want to mention that I feel incredible after my appointments. The electric machine that shoots electricity into your back feels amazing. I highly recommend Dr Kelly to anyone who has scoliosis or anyone who just wants to get those knots out of their back.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>I had such a bad knee problem over the last weekend. It was very painful for me to move my legs, let alone walking.  I could hardly walk.  After one visit with Dr. Kelly, I was able to walk the next day (pain went down from high to low).  Now after 2-3 days, I am walking with no pain and go up & down stairs with no problem.  Thank you so much, Dr. Kelly for awesome job!</Review>< Pictures>

my first visit,  I was skeptical  because they asked a lot of questions that I thought irrelevant  with my pain, but I was wrong on the next visit I got relief already. This is now my 2nd week and i scaled  my pain from 6 (more pain)  to 3(less pain). The doctor and all the staff makes you very comfortable . I love them all!!!!< /Review>

I have been suffering from migraines and headaches for many years, but never looked into chiropractic treatments until recently. After just two weeks of coming to Dr. Kelly they have almost disappeared completely! I haven't had to use any pain relievers since starting my treatment and I couldn't be happier with the progress. She has also been able to help the pain and tension in other areas of my body and overall I feel like a weight has been lifted. If you've never tried chiropractic treatments, start with Dr. Kelly.</Review>

My experience with Dr. Kelly has been life changing. For so long I have been in and out of doctor visit with issues regarding my back pain. I was prescribed a variety of medication and asked to go see a back specialist for physical therapy. Both of these attempts only helped alleviate some pain but not all. I finally decided to go look online for a wellness doctor who was my last option of help for my back. I'm so glad Kelly Wellness and Chiropractic was one of the first places that popped up after googling wellness centers in Cupertino. I am now in my third week of treatment and I am finally getting my strength back in my neck and back that have been in chronic pain for months. I'm so grateful for their services and support :)< /Text>

<name>Mia Nguyen</name><text>I must say, I am the most skeptical person when it comes to Chiropractors and what they do.  I've been having lower back problem where my disc is bulging out and is hitting my nerves which causes sharp pain up my right leg.  I am very active so imagine when I found out that I can't run, lift weights, do yoga, and/or anything that might injured my back more.  I've tried physical therapy and acupuncture.  I finally caved and went to Dr. Kelly because I was not getting the relief that I was so hoping for.

To make the story short, I've been going to Dr. Kelly for a month now and I'm a believer!  Her style, the equipment that she uses, and her method to "wellness"  is so different and so effective.  It takes time, but I am so hopeful that I will have a chance to run again.</text>< user>

I have been coming here for about 6 months now and previous to coming I noticed my foot was always in pain in the heel area. I did not know what it was and when I came to Dr. Kelly she told me I had plantar fascitis in my foot.she gave me information and we started a treatment plan.after some sessions I noticed a big difference as there was less pain.we are still working at it but the treatment and recommendations Dr. Kelly has given ne has helped tremendously. I would highly recommend coming in even if you only have minor pains as it is easier to catch things early.< /text>

She not only was able to adjust my neck immediately, which eliminated the headache right away. She also diagnosed the source of my chronic pain at lower back which other physicians weren’t capable of. My session included adjustments plus physical therapy routines. Additionally, she also provided valuable information on ergonomics of sitting in an office and driving a car. Since then, I have never experienced sudden collapse on my knees like I did before.

About two years ago I sprained my ankle during a softball game. I first went to the emergency at Samaritans in Los Gatos. All they did was take x-rays and ask me to keep my leg elevated and take pills whenever I experienced pain. Well, after 2 months on crutches and one more emergency visit, the swelling did not diminish. Worse, I completely lost the feel for my entire foot. Finally, I turned to Dr. Kelly again. After Dr. Kelly examined it and made some quick adjustments, the swelling ceased in about 2 weeks. When all muscles, tendons, bones were properly adjusted; she began recommending physical exercises to strengthen the ankle.

Today, I continue with my regiment to strengthen my ankle while maintaining correct posture whenever I can. I am walking taller than I can ever remember. Thanks to Dr. Kelly who has exceeded my expectations and preformed better than a major medical institution.</review></record>

To give this review some context....I am nearing my late 20's and one of my goals is to get into really good shape so I could once again play competitive soccer, but in order to do so I needed to lose some weight. Before seeing Dr Kelly, whenever I would go for a brisk jog, my shoulder blades would always seize up and I would be in incredible pain to the point that I would have to stop. Having played sports competitively all my life, I have always been the type of athlete that ran through the pain, but this pain was unbearable. To make a long story short, Dr K fixed my problem and I ended up running a half marathon with no back pain. To anyone who is on the fence on whether or not to see Dr K or not, I too thought of chiropractic science as a black magic with no medical science behind it, but I am a believer now. She is incredible.

Dr Kelly is friendly, honest, and will not sugar coat anything. If I could give her 3 thumbs up, I would.< /review>

Dr. Kelly is a fantastic pain miracle worker! I first found out about her through her marketing gal at my gym in Mountain View. She asked me if I had any pain and so I go on with my list of lower back, mid back, neck, left knee, and left shoulder lol. I can't remember the last time I crawled out of bed without back pain but only after a week of seeing her I woke up without it and what a blessing it felt like. I enjoy coming in regularly and seeing her very friendly staff. They are all a bunch of sweethearts and anyone who comes for the care will quickly learn exactly what I'm saying. I recommend anyone with any kind of pain or discomfort to make this place your first option. Don't let it become your last.<//Review>

I am not sure if she is aware of HIPPA but she has definitely violated it.< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I came to Dr. Kelly a couple of weeks ago because my right arm was tingling and kept on going numb. Now, after just 2 weeks, the tingling and the numbness is reduce by 50% and I can sleep better.  Also, last weekend, my elbow was very painful; she adjusted and tape it up.  After 2 days, the pain is almost gone.

Thank you Dr. Kelly!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<pics>None<//pics><Name>Alison Higuera</Name><rate>5<//rate><UserId.>100275949370312448883< /UserId.><Text>I have all great things to say about Dr. Kelly and her staff. I have been going to Dr. Kelly for 2 weeks now, and have seen her NINE times in the two weeks. That alone speaks volumes on how much Dr. Kelly cares for her patients wellness, especially for those of us that walk in experiencing extreme pain. I'm just going to quickly offer my story in case anyone in experiencing pain is looking for a chiropractic center that will take great care of you.

Two weeks ago, when I first walked in to her office, I could barely walk without experiencing excruciating shooting back pain every step of the way. I could barely sit down, and every time I stood up I had to wait 3 minutes before I could stand up straight. I had back pain that I just ignored thinking it would just go away on its own, but this time it just got worse and worse. By the time I started seeing Dr. Kelly my back was a mess, the muscles were really inflamed and would spasm at any mere light touch.

The first two consultation visits were very informative. Dr. Kelly likes to make sure her patients are well-informed, so you get mini tutorials on what a healthy spine looks like, common spine issues, and chiropractic care. She is thorough and realistic about the limitations of our body - especially a body in pain - and is honest with patients about what they can expect with progress.

She was very gentle and very careful with my incredibly pained muscles. She kinesio-taped my back to offer extra support and gave me instructions for home care until my visit the next day. That night she personally called me to check in on me because I had been in so much pain. I felt really cared for.

The next day she did a few adjustments to re-position a vertebrae that was out of place, and I could feel immediate relief. For the first time in weeks I could actually walk without feeling the shooting pains. Again, Dr. Kelly gave me instructions for home care until my visit the next day. Unfortunately, my back was so unstable that accidentally I popped it back out of place pretty much as soon as I left the office.

I toughed the excruciating pain out until my visit the next day, but as soon as I got there the next day, Dr. Kelly told me that I should have called and they could have figured out how to help me, and encouraged me to call if something like that ever happened again. I didn't even think to do that because it's so unusual to experience that level of care. So, she re-positioned that vertebrae again, taught me the proper way to move to avoid popping it back out of place, and this time it stayed.

I continued to see Dr. Kelly one more time that first week, and then 3 times this past week . Each visit of adjustments restored more and more of my range of motion and reduced my pain level. Each time she taped my back to offer extra support. After my third visit this week, l I accidentally popped my vertebrae back out again and I could feel some of the old pressure return. I called Dr. Kelly's office and they squeezed me back in even though I had just been in the office 5 hours earlier. Then, she squeezed me back in for a follow up 2 days later to make sure everything had stayed in place.

Now, two weeks later, I am experiencing no pain. I still don't quite have restored full range of motion, but it's improving day by day, and I can do many things that I have not been able to do in weeks. I know full recovery is going to be a long process.

I highly recommend Dr. Kelly for chiropractic care. Her office is a clean, bright and calming place to go to, her front office staff is cheerful and friendly. She is a doctor that cares first and foremost for her patient's wellness.</Text></record>

<review>It's been about 8 years since I injured my right knee playing soccer. After the injury I though that I would never recover again from a constant pain. I learned about Dr. Kelley from the Cupertino Farmers' Market when her staff had a table of information.  Because the injury on my right knee is getting worse, and I was starting to feel pain in my left knee as well, so I decided to seriously work on my knees. Dr. Kelly explained me that I have to follow a plan, that I need an MRI first that would determine how and where to start. After the first few visits with Dr. Kelley, I started feeling the difference on both of my knees. My pain already has demished, especially my right knee. I now feel that I will recover from years of knee pain. I've tried to improve my pain with other doctors in the past, and Dr. Kelly has given me the best results of all. I am very happy with her service.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I have been diagnosed with a few conditions and prescribed so many different medications, I’m not really sure where to start. Over the past 7 years I have been prescribed many steroids the worst being prednisone. When I started seeing Dr. Kelly I was on prednisone, along with a medication I was allergic to, so they prescribed another pill to help fight the nausea. Vicodin to help with the pain, that none of the medications could cure. I had a pill to help with the acid in my stomach. With the help of Dr. Kelly I am no longer on 6 of those medications. We still have a few more we are working on removing from my daily routine.< /text>< Rate>

Applied for a job, got other offers,  then when I asked they said take the other jobs, how professional no wonder the reviews are bad. Bad professionalism from the owner trickles down to bad food. Glad I didn't accept the offer, shows how they value potential employees. Trash like the food they serve. This is a message to the owner, good luck being that stupid.<//Review>

I ordered the carbonara pasta.  First of all, the menu says it has pancetta.  I have no idea what that was but it definitely wasn't pancetta.  Carbonara doesn't have cream nor does it have mushrooms.  I also ordered the fettucine and I didn't get fettucine, I got spaghetti.  The taste was sub par.  I do not recommend eating from here</review>

<text>I really wanted to like this place and the owner was so, so sweet... but the pasta is just awful. The pasta and sauces are pre-cooked, they just heat them up and then add whatever ingredients you choose, but they don’t mix the whole thing, so your veggies are still dry and cold. It’s also really hard to eat out of a weird paper container. The wine is “on tap” but, for some reason, it’s warm, so they mix it with a generous amount of ice. Yuck.</text></record>

<text>The worker (possibly the owner) had a great attitude. She is proud of her product and rightfully so, it is delicious! I had the feta pasta salad with pesto sauce. I love the process of seeing the ingredients, and choosing what is put in my dish.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

A bit pricey for the quality and it seemed like they didn't know their own menu, but the food was good. The sauce ended up a little watery, idk if it was an issue with the zucchini noodles, but it kinda took away from the flavor. Would love to try out some of their other combos though.< /text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. They sell something called “grilled Mac and cheese” that is just 2 slices of toast filled with about a third a cup of bland Mac and cheese. They barely even toasted the bread, and also gave me an end. Don’t bother. This place is a waste of money.<//text>

Fast service and multiple options for everything. However, my pasta is usually slightly undercooked when I dine here.<//text>

The pastas are good. I didn't like the fact that I was induced to think that the price included the beverages, and then they charged me two dollars for that.< /review>

2nd time I've ever given a place 1 star.

Waited an hour for my order than received a call from grubhub saying the order isn't coming. Apparently the restaurant had trouble contacting me. (Of course calling, texting, emailing, any of those things would've helped them to do so. Lying about attempting to contact me doesn't help so much.)

Will update review when I finally get to try some food, but this has been a 1 star experience so far.</text>

<text>Quick, efficient, friendly, communicative with each other and me, informative in a way that was not degrading. Receptionist was so sweet and polite. Vivian(I think) hopefully will be there for your visit and my next one! Very funny , courteous and kind. Professional and funny are a rare combination! Ed worked on my car, explained the suggestion of replacing my air and cabin filter,their purpose and price as well! Vivian, explained the pricing,cause it did seem pricey, but explained it's a whole service, not just an oil change! Windows, inspection of batteries,lights,fluids, filters, tire pressure, wipers, made me feel better about spending my money.Ed & Vivian, thanks for the best car shop experience,i wish I could've given you guys a tip!</text>< Pics>

So (the next morning) I get there at 7:59am walk up to a locked door and no one was inside. So I called to the jiffy lube I was located at, someone answers and says one word then hangs up the phone... I called back 3 more times, no one answered. What the hell??? That's how you do business?? So it's now 8:10am and decide to call the next closest Jiffy Lube (downtown Concord) and they answered within seconds and say theres currently no wait. Point of my story is DONT do business here go downtown Concord.<//Text></record>

Fast with their oil changes and service recommendations. In and out under half hour. I enjoy that they open at 8 Saturday mornings. Most other shops don't open til 9. One small detail I'll mention that the attendant pay closer attention to is clothing items that can scratch the side of the vehicle when leaning into it. Front panel section was showing new surface scratches in an area where something was spilled. When I cleaned off the spill I saw the scratches. They are small and shallow so I can more more than likely buff them out but they need to be more aware of zippers or anything else on the front of their clothing that could potentially scratch.</review>

<Review>Had a car wash a day before going to get my oil changed so I asked politely if they could skip their additional services like window cleaning, vacuuming, air filter check, ect and only perform the oil change. The man checking me in said he would let the technicians know. Clearly he ignored my reuqest. I had to walk out of the waiting room and into the shop where my car was 3 seperate times in order to tell workers to stop cleaning my windows, stop taking my air filters out, and all the rest. As I arrived home I had to spend an additional 30 minutes re-cleaning my windows because they left streak marks on the ones they got too, cleaning greasy (or sweaty) finger prints off of my door handles and dashboard, and fixing my in cabin air filter because they reinstalled it wrong. My simple request would have saved the workers time and effort but instead I was ignored multiple times and had to spend additional time on my own as my car left dirtier and more broken than it arrived. Unacceptable for a $70 oil change.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

I've gone to other Jiffy Lubes and they've always charged me only $30 for the labor without taxes. When I looked at the receipt, charges were reflected as if they provided parts. Needless to say, I won't return to that location any longer.</review>< pictures>

Last time I had the same service and was told to return in 15,000 miles. I was given misinformation either this time or last.

I used to go here all the time. I don't know if management changed, but the employees and quality of service has gone down the drain. Not sure if the owner is part of a juvinil release program for troubled youth. This place is as ghetto as you can get. No one greets you when you arrive and on two separate occasions I waited 10 minutes without a greeting or direction and left. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go to Jiffy lube on Concord Ave. Best service with people who care about customer service.< /review>

<review>As the man who worked on my car was ringing me up at the register, I asked him if he put coolant in my car. I asked because i knew it needed some. His answer was yes. When we went outside he said “let me just check to see if i did or not.” He did not put any coolant in. He then proceeds to fill it up and WAY OVERFILLS it, spilling the coolant all over my engine. He then has to back up my car into the garage to take some out. It is disgusting that they first of all lied to my face, and then didn’t even know how to properly fill a coolant container. These people really need to be trained better. I will never return to this jiffy lube.</review><user_id>113436639130682874345< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I like how they explain everything to you so that you can see what's needed. I am only giving them 4 stars due to the fact they charge for tire rotation after a synthetic oil change is rather cheap. $100 oil change and $300 brake job should get a free tire rotation. All the other oil change places have free tire rotation with high end oil changes, so what's their deal?<//Review><userid>110034715920794579201</userid>< rating>

I was Sent to this jiffy lube from the one on Concord Ave because their diagnostic said I had 1 spark plug that was bad  and they didn’t do full service. Told them what the other other Jiffy Lube said and Saul said they would do their own diagnostic. Diagnostic code said same as first jiffy lube I went to/ spark plug. Code P0301. Saul came in gave me an estimate for full set of spark plugs and wires. Spent 2 1/2 hours waiting. I was patient. Knew it would take about 2 hrs. Mechanic that did work came in to cool off and rest. I asked if it was almost ready. He said it didn’t fix the problem and there was so much wrong. I’m like What?  He couldn’t tell me specifics. Worried I go out to the car with Saul and mechanic only to be told that using their little hand held diagnostic machine was now reading all kinds of codes and they had no idea why. The check engine light still on and the car still vibrating very rough like it was when i brought it in.   Mechanic said that doing what they did doesn’t guarantee to fix the problem. What?    Code says spark plugs, replace, code goes away but now all these other codes start showing up and NOTHING fixed the problem $300 later. Saul said he called his manager Sade Harris and she said there was nothing they could do. Many other little discrepancies but too long to list it all. They even had the guts to tell me good luck while they walked away because they were closing. NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THEM. AND I WILL RELAY THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO GET WORk DONE. .</text>

The staff was professional, explained everything with an easy to understand chart. Not complicated at all. No pressure to purchase any extras. Reasonable price and I was in and out within 30 minutes at 5pm on a Wednesday.</Review>

<Text>This was my first visit to this location. Oil change cost me a little bit more than other places.
I think the cashier was new and talking but he himself didn’t know what he was talking about. He didn’t know anything about cars and repairs. But he was polite.
They also offered me to change something’s like every other places but I refused because my car is new and I knew that didn’t need anything else other than oil change.
If they provide me better service and try to be honest next time I will change the rating.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>Guy told me it would only take 25 mins to replace my oil, then i asked if i could use the $10 off coupon if I brought my own oil and filter and he said sure and that he would take it off the total. Then once everything is finished MORE THAN AN HOUR LATER another guy says that he cant do the coupon since i brought my own oil and that i had to pay full price.

I dropped my car at 9.00 am to do the SideCar inspection, I was told they would call me back in one hour, but nobody called me. Around 12.00 I called them several times but the phone number was busy, I came to them around 12.15, I went to the office and gave them a call, in my phone there was signal that the line was busy but there was nobody at the office, I had to change my schedule for today, they should treat the customers little bit better.<//Review>

Service Date: 01/26/15
Facts only: I drove to the facility with a car not making grinding noises.
I left the facility after an oil change with my car making severe grinding noises.
I had to make two u-turns to get back to the facility and looked under the car. The skid plate was dragging on the ground.
I asked for the manager, and advised him of the issue. After handing him my keys, he threw them across the shop to another technician. The tech pulled my vehicle into the bay and they started fixing it. After a few minutes had passed, I went out to see why it wasn't done. The manager said they were having a hard time fixing it because of damage to the skid plate. I advised him it was attached fine when I pulled into the facility. The manager then said they don't touch the skid plate. I repeated that it wasn't dragging when I came in for an oil change, and now it was, He repeated they don't touch it. I asked for his business card and he said he doesn't have one. I asked for his name and he said "Rob". I asked for his last name and he said I'm not giving you that.  He told the technician "Cosmo" working on my vehicle to just zip-tie the skid plate back on. He also gave him his phone and asked him to take pictures of the undercarriage "Just in case".
In closing, I was able to leave the facility without any grinding thanks to their zip-tie repair. Not once was there ever even an attempt to apologise. I had been coming here for over 9 years with 5 different vehicles. I will be taking my business elsewhere. Hopefully this facility can improve, as most of the recent reviews seem in line with my experience.</Text>

Ehhhh... I just said I just needed an oil change on my car... was going to be about $80. Sure... but after they told me they fill up the washer fluid and some other BS (that I could of done myself) ended up sending $120... service was ok but noticed they just slam you woth other stuff.. all I need was just an oil change, nothing else. I just did want to do the oil change because I still have to go and dump it at the newest recycling center...< /Text>

Ive never been asked to get out of my truck to have my fluids topped off. Not only was I asked to get out of my car this time, but I stood around waiting for 45 mins atleast...  I don't know what changes have been made recently to the operating procedures but, They need to go back  to how they ran things before .</Text>

< Review>
Took my car here for the first time today. I had never been to a jiffy lube before, but I was impressed. Everyone was very friendly, and they had the oil changed in about 20 minutes. Can't beat that, the shop down the street wanted my car for 6 hours to do the oil change.< /Review>

The first tech argued with me about having the right tool to release the spare tire, left, found out the guy they sent did not know what he was doing and released the spare tire myself, said they would send someone else within an hour, did not answer their phone after that from a non listed response number!  Part of it was my road side service not making the connection, but the catalyst was an untrained employee that made the first response and my night hell!  Vehicle sat for 20 hours and I am a person with a spinal injury that could not change it myself as my upper body strength is not there!  These people should be ashamed of themselves with their lack of poor professionalism, I understand there are a lot a whack jobs out there, but even waiting for a bureaucratic paper work in this instance when their employee caused this mess is inexcusable!  Still waiting the next day to get my tire changed and is obviously feels like I've been tow blocked in the area, they finally made right after the road side paper work went through, but not right ethically!  It could have been worse, but I'm glad it wasn't!  Further investigation is 443-3507 requested my roadside service, the primary number that contacted me from the towing service, as my primary number blocking all contact to me for the rest of the day!  REALLY?!<//text>

very professional. towed away 2 large commercial truck that were destroyed by vandalism and had been sitting for years. They were efficient, on time, & fair pricing. They cleaned up the area before they left and took good care of the property around them. GREAT JOB!!! Thanks so much</review>

I had to have my van towed 2.2 miles because it wouldn't start. The driver was very nice BUT they charged me $90.00. This was the day after my Mom's house caught fire and she lost everything. I needed to hurry up and get it fixed and didn't have time to call around and look for someone else. Don't make the same mistake.</review>

Needed a tow from Eureka to McKinleyville. They were able to do so within a couple of hours. Pacific Towing was unable to get a driver at all. Was about $200.<//Review>

Brian safely loaded and transported our F350 dually to a dealership over an hour away. He was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to load and reload the vehicle to prevent engine damage. Easily the friendliest tow truck driver I’ve encountered, thank you for your professional service.</text>

Humboldt Towing did an excellent job moving an oversized air stream trailer to what seemed like an impossible location. They said they could do it and they had the knowledge and the equipment to see the job through in a very short time. These folks know what they're doing. I highly recommend them.

These guys are fantastic. We were having a hard time with the various agencies to get the paperwork straight,  so we could get our friend's truck back. It ended up taking several days and they worked with us so we could afford to get it.  To thank them I made
them a great cake. Shout out to Teresa and the guys.< /review>

Dude was super cool helped me get my truck home when my tire blew because my tire bearings went out. He took his time making sure my truck didnt get damaged worse by loading it and unloading it carefully. I wish there could be a sixth star cause this place rocked< /text>

<text>If I could give minus 5 stars I definitely would. My truck was stolen and the Eureka police had it towed there. They had the truck for less than 2 hours and I was charged almost 400$ to get it back. When I arrived to pick up my truck they were very rude and caddy with me and my son. Then after I paid the money they informed me that the battery was gone and the clutch was burned out. They then pushed the truck out of the garage because apparently we weren’t allowed to start the truck inside the garage. So after buying a new battery and going back we were told about the clutch. The owner was able to get the truck to drive in first gear but him and his wife were really rude to us. The secretary was Also very rude and caddy and had the personality of a wet mop. The workers gave us dirty looks and when I asked a question I was looked at like I offended them by speaking . I’m really surprised that they are still in business. Very poor form Humboldt Towing! Grow a conscience.!!!< /text>< user_id>

Locked my keys in my car, while it was running! I was working, my car was almost in the road, as I was locking a gate before I left the site. They were super nice, said they would be there in 20 minutes tops, they were there in 15. Amazing guys!</Review>

My car was broke into and my ignition lock cylinder was destroyed rendering the car immobile and even unable to put it out of park. The guy who helped me (Brian I think, I forgot) was super cool, super friendly, and was able to go under my vehicle and manually put it neutral to take it to a shop. The mechanic was only a few blocks away and it cost $85 which was kind of a drag but it's what I expect, most towing company's charge a minimum and there's was actually less than most I've dealt with. But I still gave Brian a extra tip cause he was such an awesome dude.
P.s. I hope the guys name is Brian I forgot...... it started with a B for sure< /text>

We contacted roadside assistance because the battery in our van had died.   Humboldt towing contacted us immediately and were out to help within 10 minutes. They were fast and friendly.<//review>

They towed it and when we tried to get our car back 6 hours later they said it would cost $492 because it was the weekend and there was an extra cost for someone to come out. They only had it for 6 hours! Or we could wait until Monday but it would still be $477 because of the daily storage fees. This car was not even worth that much! This place is a rip off and the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the owner was there when we were complaining about the cost being more than the car was worth so he lowered the price for us to get it out.< /review><Gmap_id>0x54d1557af8c94103:0x5c6ed0211973c45d<//Gmap_id>< rating>

< Review>
Eureka police dept.had contact with my son,and had my car towed and when I received notice of that,it said it was towed by humboldt tow,I called to get information about the car,they didn't think they had my car,so they took my phone number and said they would get back to me,I waited all day,so I called them again,that's when tey told me they didn't have it.When I told them I wished that they had let me know when they realised,the woman in the office was extremely rude.and because of her not getting back to me,I was charged for another day at the other tow company.I would never refer anyone to this company..VERY RUDE</Review>

<text>My mom's car was wreaked and she asked to have her car taken to her house and they stole it. They have no right to take a car like that. thieves is what they are. then my mom went to get her stuff and the dude followed her and my brother right behind them the whole time being a rude jerk. Reality check dude, it is HER car and HER stuff. What you are doing is wrong. You cannot steal someones car. they were following her around making sure she didnt steal parts off of HER car. I will never deal with you and if you ever show up and for a wreak i am in you can be sure i am keeping my car. THIEVES THIEVES THIEVES.  Yup it's so american to think you have a right to someone else's stuff.  She has new tires and parts on that car and they will get away with STEALING them and selling them. Makes me so mad that people get away with this crap everyday. You are not the law, you do not have a right to take peoples cars............................................</text><resp>None</resp></record>

Alyssa had helped me earlier with my previous apartments' renters insurance. I was so impressed with the quick service she provided. This year I contacted her myself so that she can provide me with renter's insurance for my new apartment. As expected, she was so easy to connect with , all my work was done within 30 minutes. I  would highly recommend her if anyone wants to get their renter's insurance done. I have found my permanent go to person for upcoming renter's insurance. :)<//text>

My agent April Aguirre, was knowledgeable, understanding and most of all kind. She made me feel at ease knowing she had all the answers to my questions.

Kim Whippie with State Farm Insurance Agency in Glendora is one of the best insurance agents I have ever had.  I have moved my business from company to company, but I am staying with State Farm.  Kim provides professional service while continuing to be friendly and personable.  Always advising options for better coverage while trying to keep State Farm price conscience.<//text>

Alyssa has been the most helpful representative at State Farm. We currently have a home policy and 3 cars insured under State Farm and when we ask for quotes and have any questions in regards to our policy we always get a call back immediately and email confirmations. My husband has been insured with this agency since he was around 16 years old he’s now 48 and we have been so happy them! Great pricing & friendly service go a long way!</Review>

<review>I have been with the agency for several years and have always been very satisfied with the customer service. Alyssa has gone far and beyond to meet my expectations and always made sure she took care of my policies in a timely manner. Hilda Granados is a great agent and makes sure her clients are taken care of promptly. If I could give this office more stars I would cause they supersede all expectations.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Been with Hilda over 20 years. Recently had to look into an umbrella policy. Spoke with agent Kimberly W., she was able to walk me through the entire process smoothly. She was quick to respond to all my emails. And this is why I stay with Hilda's office.</Review>

You are so willing to help at anytime and I appreciate that.
You go above and beyond what work requires.  You take your time helping me and you never rush me.  You look for the best coverage for me.
You even help both my sons too.

So. Gotta Say Vanessa Garcia is hands down the best agent i've ever operated with within the insurance realm. Most of the time, you never know who you can trust in this industry...however whenever I need help, she is the one who gets me taken care of, always does her best to give me the best deals she can and qualify me for the most competitive rates and always ends our conversations with laughs and great vibes. I not only would but already have recommended so many friends and family members to this branch solely because of her service and hope she is seen and respected amongst her peers for her outstanding work. #RealTalk<//text>

I read online that State Farm had bank products. So I walked in while getting my haircut next door and asked if they can help. The girl at the front desk April explains everything about the credit card I wanted to apply for. She even advised me through what she thought was best. I have had this card for 4 months now and I've had one question. When I called they were able to answer my question without putting me on hold or make me wait. They have a very friendly staff that's been around for a long time! You won't waste your time coming here. You'll get what you're looking for.</review>

For the contractor I work for, I deal with sub-contractor's insurance agents on a regular basis.  I have worked with some good and some not so good.  Kim responded fast and efficiently to her sub-contractor's needs.  I appreciate that and I know her client does too.  Kim helps both of us do our job better.

I HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone looking for a solid long term Insurance company.</Text>

I have been with Hilda's office for years.
Everyone in her office is dedicated to helping her clients, always there ready to help. It's definitely a family atmosphere office.
I have several policies that Kim has always graciously written for me. Very happy my family has also joined her office.  Would never consider going anywhere else.</Text>

<Review>What a FANTASTIC office! My family have been members for over 15 years. There is no other insurance agency that will work with you the way this office does. Please ask for Kim, she will get you the very best coverage at the perfect price.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Hilda Granados is an outstanding agent, she has a great team in her corner. Most of the time when I need help, I call and ask for Kimberly Whippie, maybe because she has helped me since day one. Kim provides excellent customer service, she is on top of things and will get things done no matter what. Kim goes above and beyond to make this customer happy. I appreciate all you do. Keep up the good work.< /review>

Kimberly Whippie always makes me feel comfortable. I trust her and know that she has my best interest at heart. She goes above and beyond and that is why I am still with State Farm after so many years.  She explained a policy that I had that allowed me to pull cash out with zero penalties. I was unaware that my universal life policy allowed me to do so. I thank her for saving me by informing me. I was just about to pull from my 401k.< /review>

My family and I have been with State Farm Insurance for many years. Kim Whippie in particular has always been so responsive to any and all our requests. When I was in a car accident, when I purchased my first property it has always been a pretty smooth process. She is always friendly and very easy to communicate with. Always great customer service from Hilda and her team.< /review>

My Experience is second to none. My exeperience having Leslie Carrillo as my agent is more than just security for my self and my future daughter to come. It's one less thought of stress knowing I am in good hands. All state says they have people I. Good hands but not like my State Farm agent leslie.

My mama has "triple A" (AAA) and let's just say she gets a little jealous that she get put on hold when calls her insurance agency. But with leslie my calls, questions, and concerns get answered before you can say State Farm. Not even kidding. This place is legit. I appreciate the personal at this agency and can't stress that enough.

So if your looking for insurance and a peace of mind  Leslie Carrillo will easily have that covered.

Thanks< /Text>

I have been insured by State Farm Insurance for over ten years and just recently I had my car, which is a convertible Toyota Solara, vandalized. The convertible top was ripped horribly and the right side passenger window was shattered with glass sprawled everywhere. To top it off it apparently happened on New Years while I was out of town. As soon as I became aware of the situation I contacted Kim Whippie. She immediately provided me with the information I needed to begin my claim. Once my claim was submitted I was scheduled for a vehicle inspection. The inspector provided the estimate and I was handed a check for the damages. I was also given a detailed list of the companies that provided State Farm with the estimates. Thereafter, I took my car in for repair, only to find out additional issues were identified. The repair shop contacted State Farm and another inspection was scheduled within a few days. After the 2nd inspection State Farm approved of the additional repairs and issued another check directly to the company repairing my car. Overall I just want to say that State Farm is the most professional and prompt insurance company that I have ever worked with. I use State Farm for car, home and renters insurance and because of that and my good driving record I receive discounts; that helps when you're on a budget. For the majority of my dealings with State Farm I have worked with Kim and she has repeatedly provided exceptional service. Her professionalism and friendly personality make me feel like family. Thank you Kim for your outstanding customer service as well as your prompt assistance each time I've needed it!! For anyone looking for a prompt, professional, honest and trustworthy insurance company with State Farm you will find just that!!< /text>

<Text>Joe was extremely helpful. He made sure that my tires matched the old ones and gave a great deal at check out. He was very committed to great customer service and gave me a new experience now driving my car. I could feel more safe in it and drives smooth on the freeway now. Which is important since I drive far distances a lot.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I give American Tires 5 stars. Joe, whom was at the front desk at time I needed service exceeded my customer service expectations. He addressed my car issues in a concise manner which is gold when car language is foreign to me. I don’t know why this place has so many bad reviews, perhaps there is now new staff but this place is far from a 1 star. Thank you so much American Tire Depot for the great customer service you provided.<//Review>

<Review>unfortunately I had a very upsetting experience with this company. Other tire shops that I’ve been to always give you a alignment sheet of what your cars alignment was before and how it is now, if they don’t do that upfront without you having to ask for one their work is trash, other words how do I know if I got a 4 wheel alignment if I have no proof? Also while charging me 89 dollars I expected for them to be a little more professional, others charge 60 dollars for 4 wheel alignments give you a sheet so you can be informed their work was 100% well done and makes you even tip them for good work, this shop is the opposite. Be aware of this shop.< /Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Would most deffenantly recommend going here! Came in for a family vacation and on our final day we realized we had a big bubble and just would prefer new tires for our long drive home. Not only did they squeeze us in but their prices were a huge shock to us,wonderful deal on all four! He also recommend where we could get food while we waited which was also a wonderful recomendation!(Ruby's , if anyone is curious) He helped direct us towards where we needed to go and what interstates to avoid given the time it was. They were quick, efficient, kind and just a good choice all around.< /Text>< user_name>

<review>I don’t know who Eno is but he was EXTREMELY rude to me over the phone and I had a simple question for him about gettin air into my tires, he was cutting me off in my sentences and not allowing me to explain my situation entirely, even before I could finish my last sentence he hung up the phone and cut me off! I’ve never dealt with a more inconsiderate person in a single 3 min conversation in my life. I hope this business does better with customer care and not forcing me to make decisions that will affect me car in the future.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmap_id>0x80dcd627458c6d4d:0x1f122cde9b43f2af< /gmap_id>< Time>

I just went in for tires yesturday morning and my car has a flat already. Disrespectful. I went in with my uncle to get tires on my car and they kept ignoring my request on what size tires I needed and choose to put whatever tires they wanted . A size bigger. They went ahead and did  what they wanted without permission.  They didnt want to give me a price until they finished .and they didnt give me a recipe either.<//Text>

The staff here cares more about their coffee than customers. This post will be followed by a letter to corporate. In an attempt to receive service from this poor excuse of a business, I was treated poorly and disrespectfully by an employee.  I can to get mybture checked out and attempted to wave over an employee to get assistance.  Mind you, it was pouring rain outside. When I attempted to drive into the stall,  then and only then did the employee then attempt to participate in doing his job. Upon stopping and talking to the gentleman,  which is a word I would not use on his behalf, but I digress, he told me I couldn't park in the bay. I let him know that I was trying to get his attention. He arrogantly responded then you should have gotten out of your car. Well maybe you should get off your butt and participate in working and tend to customers. But as I drove up, it was obvious that his coffee was more important than dealing with customers while his fellow employees dealt with customers. I didnt realize that he was being put out for an hourly wage. In turn, I WILL NEVER spend my good, hard earned money at this establishment EVER!!! Anaheim city employees and residents deserve to be treated respectfully by Anaheim businesses.  If you don't wish to work, stay home.</Text>

Didnt honor tire warranty last month when the tires were defective by not holding air.  Nelson at the store was extremely rude and kept saying he showed me the negligence on the tires, but he didnt, instead he wlrudely argues with me & charged me an extra $290.00 for 2 new tires when I spent $490.00 for 4 new ones in November 2018. Never shop there, they are not corporate and have no accountability to the America tire Depot corporation!</text>

I brought my car here for 2 new tires. I asked the mechanic what was a good inexpensive tire for my type of car 2008 528i , he showed me a very inexpensive tire so I questioned him about the performance of the tire and was told that this tire is fine and would be OK. OK so here where it get's kinda fishy..during the installation the mechanic calls me over to show me that the rims on my car are bent?? So I asked him to move the tires around and I will have them checked immediately. I am in the process of having them checked out right now, will post my finding later however, I am being told it's going to be a cheap tire not a bent rim??  Previous work here has been satisfactory..</review>

<review>Terrible......i broke down near the freeway and got my car to this shop thinking I would be treated with courtesy. Diagnose was 50 bucks and after they come to me telling me I needed a new radiator, thermostat, and upper and lower hose, and the total would come out to "only 632". This was to much for me to pay so I got my car towed from here. Got home and a friend checked out my car and discovered that  I only needed a single $20 hose replaced. Got it done and the car runs perfectly fine. Watch out for these guys, they're not mechanics, they're just salesman getting paid on commision.  No heart.</review>< resp>

Avoid this place!
The first time I tried to give them my business, I chose the tires I wanted from their website and they called me saying that they didn't have them and wanted to use more expansive, weird brand tires. They told me they wouldn't order the ones I wanted. The ATD in Lake Forest ordered the ones I wanted without even asking anything.
So I bought my tires in Lake Forest and was told I had free tire rotation in any ATD. I got my appointment at this location in Anaheim and they said they wouldn't do it because they are a franchise.< /review>

I just went to get some rotors turned and the guy was a prick giving me a hard time saying he'd rather not turn them just because I asked to measure them I was being polite and everything $1,000 tires there last year I will never go there again. I called him back and explain to him that I was a long time customer and he didn't seem to care I would never go there if I were you<//Review>

I went there this AM (5/12/2013) with a tire that had lost pressure (and would not stay inflated properly).  They quickly discovered they could patch the tire and had my car back in my hands within an hour.  They were fast and the manager was friendly and professional.  I recco this ATD.</Text>

I have tried going to this place for three years, everytime I go here he denies me service. I don't know why I keep coming back besides its close to my house. Even in a desperate situation of a flat tire with my current and previous vehicles they say there short staffed and refuse me service or tell me to come back tomorrow because there too busy. I don't know what's up with this dude but I cant help think its a race thing or I'm not sure but horrible customer service either way. I'm going to officially take my business somewhere else.<//text>

I love their sweet hot sauce! It reminds me of the Asian Zing at Buffalo Wild wings and I love that sauce so much I always buy their bottles of sauce. If this reminds me of that sauce, it means it's really good! I always get the wings when I go. My boyfriend loves the Cali heat and he'll get the chicken sandwich and sliders in that sauce. If your in the mood for fried chicken sandwiches, this is a great spot.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I really enjoyed this sandwich. I had the traditional chicken sandwich. I ordered via Postmates and appreciate that the restaurant staples the bag. The breading looks intimidating however it had a mild flavor. Not overpowering at all. The chicken was very tender. The bread was soft. It was a very delicious sandwich.</review>< pics>

I got the Cali heat and lemon pepper sliders and that ranch is amazing.  I gave it a 4 only because the buns should be heated, it would add that extra umph. Other than that I will definitely be back.<//text><rating>4<//rating>< Pictures>

<rating>3</rating><Text>Fyrebird is located right across the street (Crenshaw/Manhattan Beach Blvd)from El Camino Community College inside a small strip mall. Parking here he plentiful with two-disabled spaces which includes one van access and one regular.

Once inside, their menu is on their entrance wall, simple menu with gourmet tasting food. If you were planning on dining in, bring a table because they only have two chairs, yes, only two chairs...😅</Text>< Pics>

How big is your bite? Fyrebird serves up plump, juicy chicken sandwiches, tenders, and wings! Lots of flavors, including their special “fyrebird sauce”. Levels of spicy range from mild, warm, spicy, and FIRE. We had some of each. Friendly service - they greeted me like I was a neighbor, a local friend (right across from El Camino College - there is a student discount too). Excited to add this small business to our rotation!< /Text>

Great portions and you can tell they care about their quality control. The ranch is obviously made in-house and I highly recommend it!</Text>

<text>I wasn't super astounded but maybe because this place is so hyped up I was expecting a bit more. Don't get me wrong this place is delicious but just didn't live up to all the hype for me. I would definitely try the sandwich again maybe with the waffles next time but would not wait 2-3 hours for this.<//text></record>

<Text>The heat to taste ratio is perfect on the fyrebird style sandwich. Is it the hottest? No. But that's what I really enjoy about this place. The flavor of the seasoning and sauce, the textured crunch of the crispy chicken, the soft and fluffy toasted bun all come together for one amazing sandwich that keeps me returning. Even the sweet heat flavored chicken strips are perfectly yummy and sticky for a filling lunch. Highly recommend, will be returning as often as I can.</Text>< Pictures>

Ordered chicken sandwich and fries. Food was frozen for so long the meat was dark from the inside and rubbery on the edges. Same with fries. They were stale. The flavor was pretty good but Not good enough to make up for the old and stale food.<//text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>Their food is DELICIOUS! The Fyrebird chicken sandwich packed some heat, but not too much where it's hard to enjoy. The fries were similar to In N Out fries, freshly cut and fried. I wish their wings were crispier, it seemed like they were crispy and the sauce smothered out the crisp.
I think their dipping sauces are homemade because they tasted so fresh and AMAZING. I could spend all day with a mess of their fries and dipping sauces.

Their staff is super nice and welcoming, too. I'll definitely be back.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b5eab17e7181:0xab5f3d66f01c5b89</Gmap_id></record>

Ong , it was so delicious. The customer service was on point. I ordered the family pack. Every piece was cooked right. The fries taste homemade..yum. I had 3 different flavors..I couldn't tell which was best, all were amazing. It was my first time. I live down the street. I see long lines here all the time. I had to try. Now I see why. 5 stars.. so good.<//Text>

<Review>Honestly. This is better than Chick-Fil-A. I got the Lemon Pepper Chicken sandwich and filled my fix of wing stop lemon pepper flavor and a Chick-Fil-A sandwich all in one. Definitely recommend. Boyfriend had the Honey Chipotle chicken sandwich, rated at 4 spicy but good over all, said it wasn't that spicy but delicious nonetheless. I am definitely returning. Next try- Cali Hot chicken sandwich.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTxLoQMTfjVcXALhf9QRfFuOT06JypTSlH9aIc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBCBBrvdhjOPeLZVgt3ZzTC6G64emc4LAtwNsw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record>

<user_name>Israel Wagner<//user_name><review>They give you a lot of food. The menu says "2 sliders" but it's more like 2 full sandwiches, the biggest sliders I've seen by far. The "Hot" flavor is pretty hot but not unbearable in my opinion. I'm going to try the "Extra Hot" and the Reaper when I go back! Thanks for the good service.<//review>< Date>

This is the best lunch deal in the Crenshaw Mall!!...2 tacos, chips and a drink for just $4.99!!  I get the shredded beef or shredded chicken tacos and they are delicious. I always pair it with Jamaica and get plenty of salsa to go with my chips.  Always feel satisfied afterwards...truthfully I really want a 3rd taco but I try not to be greedy plus I really like only spending $5 for lunch lol<//text>

I have previously catered my event from this location with Good results BUT I will not use this location again.  The tacos were soggy,  very skimpy as far as filling.  The hard shells were white and soft. No salsa provided with CATERED ITEMS. Will not go back.....enchalades were like little egg rolls definitely not what I've had in the past. Service was provided on Friday Dec 14, 2018< /Text>

The people that work there act like they are doing you a favor.  There attitudes are horrible and so was the food.</Review>

This is my favorite location with my favorite food the staff here is a little on the up and up and does need some getting used to but overall the quality of freshness always remains top-tier at this location highly recommend.< /review>

<Review>Just had the worst experience ever here. So upsetting im still sitting here as I write this. First the young man at the counter rushed us through ordering as if we were inturrupting something important other than him being at work. once our food was ready, it sat on the counter for aboit six minutes, after seeing the food just sitting there for some time my wife and I had to interrupt the two young people behined the counter having a full on discussion to ask if that was oir food. Agaain the young man with a hreat deal of attitude retorts they did call us we just didnt answer, wich would have been ok if we had not been sitting directly across from them watching their conversation. I am not an arguer so I took my food and went to eat. I ordered guacamole on the side but it was not on my plate so I went back to inquire about it as the young man barked me down that i requestided it in my burrito amd not on the side. I ask to speek to another staff person becaise at this point it could have gotten a bit agressive. Im a pretty easy going customer who really just wants good service amd friendly faces, I did not get that here. If you want good service I would pass by Green Verde in Crenshaw Mall becaise it doesnt seem like they have enough time to serve their customers and I would hate for anyone else to inturrupt the staff by ordering food and breaking up their staff conversations.< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) This place has flavor and very good flavor but the people who work here have to be more friendly because as a client we want them to tend us well
When a person takes good care of me, I leave an exaggerated tip, I don't care if I tip 100 or 200, but they take good care of it and this is what this place needs, more professionalism, in my case I work with pure famous people from here in Hollywood and I work in 2 private and well-known hotels

(Original)
Este lugar tiene sabor y muy buen sabor pero la gente que trabaja aquí tienen que más amables por que como cliente es lo buscamos que nos a tiendan bien

I ordered from Mama Mia’s through Uber eats recently. I was horrified and how dis is ting the pizza was. I told my roommate and she was surprised because she had been before and loved it. She went a few days after o had ordered and confirmed to me that it was horrible.

Apparently it is under new ownership. Whatever the new owner is doing is definitely not working! As my roommate said not even close to new you’re style pizza any more. She didn’t even finish the one slice she got. When I ordered I threw the second slice away. If I could give zero stars on this restaurant I would. Hopefully the new owner will get a clue and change what he is doing.<//review>

This is a hit or miss. You have a better meal if you order the whole pizza pie...cheese and crust nut not contents. Ordered a pepperoni and we received seriously about 2 pieces of pepperoni in each slice.  Not worth the price!</Review>

Best NY style pizza I've had in the Santa Clarita area. It's thin and tasty. Nothing fancy or crazy additions. Just a good slice of New York style pizza.<//review>

< Review>
This was one dirty restaurant with some of the grossest food I’ve ever had. I’m shocked to see so many positive reviews. They have got to be fabricated. The place is filthy. We ordered and on the way to sit down my son spilled his water so I got some napkins to clean it up. A couple wipes later the napkins were filled dirt. As we sat down and I looked around I noticed that all the tables were dirty and that there was a thick layer of dirt throughout the restaurant floor It was obvious they hadn’t cleaned anything in awhile. Multiple sodas were watered down or out of order. The food was really gross. I saw them microwave my sons pizza slice. Yes, microwave. The cheese pizza, calzone, and mozzarella sticks were swimming in grease and had a strong oil aftertaste. It was so bad we threw more than half of our food away. My stomach has hurt most of the afternoon which turned into diarrhea, and eventually my acid reflux was so bad from all the grease that I just barfed my brains out before typing this review.

I’ll also mention that I love pizza, and my family goes to all types of restaurants often. I’ve never had such a poor experience at a restaurant here in SCV and I hope nobody else wastes their money here.</Review>

What this isn't is 'Cali' style gourmet pizza; if you are expecting an ultra -thin crust with scant cheese and odd toppings look elsewhere.
A lot of the flavor is in the dough, and it takes someone with a lot of experience to make it taste 'right'. I've eaten at many pizza places here and can honestly say there are  very few  in So-Cal  where I've had authentic New-York pizza (Maria's comes to mind)-- and this is one of them.< /Text><username>Roland 13</username>< pics>

It taste like they just put some cheap tomato sauce and cheese on top of  and it was completely burnt. Next day I got sick. Bad, bad, bad!!! I never thought that I would write a bad review for this place but they totally messed up!!!! It was totally a waste of $30..Tried to get the manager, never got response back.</Review>< gmapID>

Absolutely delicioso!!  Thin, crispy, exactly like I get in New York!  When we first walked in, we didn't like the look of the slices that were available,  but the very nice guy working said, "just tell me what you want, I make them fresh for you"...it was national pizza day, and we have never been here before, but I guarantee it won't be long before our next visit!< /review>

<user_id>107489707094529733249< /user_id><rating>1< /rating><text>Absolute joke!!! They didnt bother to tell me my order was cancelled till over an hour and a half later. Their excuse? I was outside the delivery distance, upon punching in their address I was 4.9 miles away. When he explained the route he had set it was way out of the way to make it go over their 5 mile radius. That doesnt even top the absolute absurd attitude this guy had with me calling me a liar whilst I have the email stating it was confirmed and an eta for the delivery. I will absolutely not order from here again and will not recommend them to anyone!</text>< Date>

Would recommend getting there early, since everything usually ends pretty quickly and there isn't much of a selection afterwards.  However, best bakery in town< /review>

The short chubby chick was rude. I think she was the owner or the manager. The bread was mediocre at best. Decent bolillo, but who just wants decent?  Honestly though, if it wasn't for the rude chubby chick, it would have been 3 stars for the mediocre bread.< /review>

Great place for bread, note that there are no public bathrooms! But other than that the bread is great and there is variety! They even have warm bolio to be served at any moment!</Review>

I have already made a report to the public health agency hpffly they investigate it as its not the frist time they have served bad quality bread. They once sold me a very dull dry cake!! Its too bad because their bread smells so good but ill pass from now on cuz i dont want to get sick again and miss work!!!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) Delicious 😋 !! Although I live retired from that bakery I try to go more often, because we really like the taste of bread, Puebla style, it is very very tasty. However, the only problem I see is that there is almost never parking, especially on weekends, it is really something very annoying for me that it is always the same problem in all that area of ​​Los Angeles.

(Original)
Delicioso 😋!! Aunque vivo retirado de esa panadería trato de ir más a menudo, por que nos gusta mucho el sabor del pan, estilo puebla, es muy muy sabroso.  Sin embargo, el único problema que veo es que casi nunca hay estacionamiento en especial fines de semana, es para mi de verdad algo muy fastidioso que siempre es el mismo problema en toda esa área de Los Angeles.</Text>

(Translated by Google) This bread is good that they do the only thing is that there are no restrictions as in others that do not allow one to grab the bread for health many people do not save if they are healthy here one can serve himself and there is no social distance, much less ... in these times they should be more cautious 😳😳😳

(Original)
Esta bueno el pan q hacen lo unico es q no hay restrictions como en otras q no dejan que uno agarre el pan por sanidad muchas personas no savemos si estan sanas aqui uno puede servirse solo y no hay distancia social😷mucho menos .. pienso q en estos tiempos deverian ser mas prudentes 😳😳😳<//review>

The cashier is the most odious, it shows that he has no preparation to serve the customer, is rude in the way he answers and believes that this bakery is the only one in that neighborhood.
OAXAQUEÑA EXPRESSION bread is better

(Original)
He probado pan mucho mejor.
El cajero es de lo más odioso se nota que no tiene preparación para servir al cliente es rudo en la forma de contestar y cree que esa panadería es la única de ese barrio.

(Translated by Google) The bread is delicious, what I did not like was that they did not give me permission to take my girl to the bathroom, I know they are not public toilets but at least to their clients, we go from Las Vegas Nv to buy and that they agan that as I did not like it

(Original)

(Translated by Google) I give the cashiers from 1 to 10 a 6
The bad thing is they don't have a public bathroom
Another thing they do not have much variety in the sweet bread
Another problem is parking, it is difficult to find a place even on the street, it is very difficult despite its location.

(Original)
A los cajeros les doy  del 1 al 10 un 6
Lo malo esque no tienen bańo publico
Otra cosa no tienen mucha variedad en el pan dulce
Otro problema es el parking cuesta encontrar un lugar hasta en la calle es muy dificil apesar de su ubicacion<//review>
