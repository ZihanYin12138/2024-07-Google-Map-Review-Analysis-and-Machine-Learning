The attendant at the gas station was able to fix our flat tire on our vacation. He took the tire off the car, and took it off the rim. He patched the tire on the inside of the tire.All this took around a half an hour.We sure appreciate his help. Thank you !< /text>

<Review>Gas is gas except when you're out.  Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells are the only stations in the Park.  They are both a bit more expensive than an urban setting, but what did you expect!  Not exorbitant, but welcome, with standard credit card pumps.  Service for serious problems is likely to require a long tow to Nevada.  Don't come here with sketchy tires or overdue maintenance, and no harm in carrying back up a fan belt and fluids--gas, oil, antifreeze, water, and beer in case none of the above work.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Hole in the wall. There is no store or clerk. Soda machine outside $1.50 coke products.
Gas is 4 something<//Review>

This is expensive place, but if you don't have another options,  it helps evade death! So, prepare your wallets, before visit Furnance Creek Gas Station! Poor people will die!< /text>

<Text>They say that they are open 24 hours, but you can only get propane from 8am to noon. That's not good if you are out of propane. The next nearest propane tank filling service is 50 miles away.
So after spending $95 to fill my diesel tank with their very expensive fuel, they wouldn't fill my propane tank. This is December, which is a high tourist season.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Only stop if you absolutely have to. Even Stovepipe Wells not that far away was 50 cents cheaper with more amenities including being able to buy a cold drink, some food, and gifts, which isn't offered at Furnace Creek Gas Station, even the vending machine was broken.< /text>

They have three grades of gas, plus diesel. Prices are high, perhaps the highest you've  ever paid, but get over it. Unless you drive a gas truck, you will be happy to see this place.</Text>

Stick your head out the window of the moving car... it felt like a hair dryer blowing in your face on high, close up.  Anyone who stays in this location to sell gas to travelers... deserves a bonus/premium on the gas price!  If they are open... and selling gas... service is excellent... I don't care how high the price, how dirty the bathrooms may be!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Roadsign posted price was not the same as the pump price. Inquired what the price was and if difference was cash or credit and they quoted the roadside posted price. Pumps charged more than roadside posted price. Typically in the $5 bucks a gallon. Most positive reviews are locals associated with he station. Do your self a favor and get gas before this point, Many within 20-30 miles. Dollar or more less per gallon.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c7415555555527:0xd3171a5d8f792048</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Avoid this station unless you want to get gouged. Gas in surrounding areas is $3/gallon, and $5.50 a gallon  at the Furnace Creek Station. They know that they are the only nearby station, and will take full advantage of people for that fact.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Outrageously expensive at 3.28 / Galone.
They know they can afford it. Around it, within 80 miles, there is only an even more expensive gas station.
The service was good though. We were helped here quickly and free of charge because of a tire problem.

Unverschämt teuer bei 3,28/Galone.
Sie wissen, dass sie sich das leisten können. Drum herum gibt es im Umkreis von 80 Meilen nur eine noch teurere Tankstelle.

<review>(Translated by Google) Expensive gas station in Death Valley.
The best way to refuel before entering the Valley, then you save those expensive prices.
Even ice cream costs a fortune here.

Teuere Tankstelle im Death Valley.
Am besten vor Einfahrt ins Valley tanken, dann erspart man sich diese teueren Preise.
Selbst ein Eis kostet hier ein Vermögen.<//review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Since it is expensive, let's manage it firmly so that you do not need to enter here.

Its a romantic ride in this double decker carousel. Nostalgic. For me non-American was out of the old Hollywood movies. The whole experience is pretty nice. I do not like the fast rides.<//review>

<Review>The showpiece at the front of the park since the park opened in the 70s. It (along with its sister the Columbia Carousel in Illinois) is the tallest in the world. The double decker features a number of whimsical animals and horses (modeled after famous carousel horses) on the lower deck and horses alone on the upper deck. The song played as it turns was composed for the merry go round. Its lovely at night on the upper deck seeing the lights of the park go round.</Review><username>Lacey Bryant< /username><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

It is very beautiful at night! We were there on Dec 31. Lights and music made the ride very enjoyable.</Review>

Weird hearing all those adds over the loudspeakers about having the "best day ever" when people are constantly cutting in front of you in line and the staff does nothing, even when they see it directly in front of them.
Would give 4 stars if I didn't have options of either being a line monitor or constantly getting cut in front of in line on my "best day ever."<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><username>Adam Still</username><review>Not often do I give compliments, I recently visited the Blythe store and had a Terrific experience with the manager Amber! I’m not by any means mechanically inclined,Amber had great knowledge on my situation of a cracked fuel line (impressed) , I followed her through the store and gathered the parts needed to do the job! Thank God for Amber, she is polite,incredible knowledge with a great personality!! At first I said to myself Oh NO a girl behind the counter, Wow I was wrong! I’ve owned several sports Bars for over 35+ years and you don’t find to many ladies of this caliber ! I can imagine most customers coming in are not the happiest but I’m sure when they leave they have a smile on their face ! There not many employees left out there that have the drive & personality - care about the customers situation! Again I very seldom give compliments, it is with great pleasure to let you know about Amber!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>107991254589569662374</userid></record></dataset><record>

Bought a battery a while back. It lost its charge. Didn't have a receipt when I took it back. They kept the battery overnight and charged it for me no questions asked. Worked perfectly. Thank you Napa!< /Review>

<text>Travis and Will are great people to work with and know how to get you the correct parts. After dealing with that joke in alpine it was nice to work with professionals and pay a fair price for the parts I needed.

Dealer quoted 3K to replace brake boost pump on my tundra. I was able to purchase the same part for 600 exchange. I went back to the dealer and they agreed to install my purchased pump. I returned the core-pump back to County Motor Parts and was out the door for less than 900 including the dealer’s labor. They saved my truck!!<//Text>

Wow! A nice big store that looks like it must have everything, just like in the good old days! When you had to replace spark plugs every year! Ok that part wasn't so good, but back then there were well-stocked parts places everywhere.<//Text>

All I wanted was to buy a funnel and leave.  The cute tattooed girl behind the counter was too bust "chatting" with the previous customer  to allow me to pay for my purchase.  After standing there for several minutes, I gad to butt in and ASK to pay fir my funnel.  Unprofessional, won't be going back.</Review>

This is our neighborhood place.  Great food. Good service almost all the time. I saw the review about the rude guy.  I think I have met him. That us an outlier.  I've been a client for 20 years and the service was always great and usually female.  When the pandemic is over, this is a great spot for an early or late lunch.</text>

Some of the best Indian food in this part of Oakland! The portions are decent, flavor amazing, and they don’t play around with spice levels! Don’t ask for Indian hot if you can’t handle it! The okra dish is delicious and every time I order lamb and I’m never disappointed. They have chai available free of charge in the dining room too, goes well with the spicy dishes. The naan is also in good portions and not skimped on. Sometimes the restaurant can be super crowded, so try to visit on slower times or order takeout.<//review>

< Review>
If, like us, your favorite indian food place closed, try this place. We called the restaurant and picked up our order about 20 minutes later.  The food was not quite ready, so we waited about 5 minutes.  Warning, look for the Kerry House awning- the place is under it. We are about 10 minutes door to door.  Our food was so hot we had to be careful dishing it out.   We enjoyed chicken  tikka masala, tandoori grill, lamb curry, and dal makhani.  Since it was our first time ordering, we got everything medium.  It was hot enough to complement the spiciness and leave some burn in your mouth, very enjoyable.  We also had veggie pakora and veggie samosa.  We ordered plain naan and garlic naan.  The last of the naan was used to mop up  the curry and masala sauces. I even got some papadum.  We paid $83 for all that Indian food wonderfulness.  We will definitely be back.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I'm a professional chef. The service was professional and patient. One server and three cooks handled an increasingly busy dinner service. To have a full dining room and not rush the diners takes patience and professionalism.

The food was made to order. I watched it with my own two eyes. Vegetables weren't overcooked, curries were delicately balanced, and the fish was juicy. My guest lived and cooked in India for years, raised a family on Indian food, and after eating seven dishes from Raj's even she was satisfied.

The atmosphere was intimate. I could hear the conversations of the other happy diners mixing with the sounds and smells from the three man kitchen.

I wish their large menu was larger. That would give me more reasons to return.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Was craving late night briyani . This place was open I decided to get lamb briyani, chicken tikka and some naan . The dishes didn’t have Salt at all. I added my own salt and ate but the briyani  was terrible it looked like someone just mixed lamb curry with rice& raisins!!! .. no flavor . The garlic naan was stuffed with so much garlic it was too over powering. Chicken tikka was made with cashew and it was sooo blend the chicken was soo hard
Complementary kheer was just boiled rice  milk& sugar no cardamom nuts or anything!!
Very disappointed</Review>

If you want a spirit drink, no worries, this restaurant it's connected to a Bar.

The foods is pretty dank but be wary of ordering take out. The delivery driver doesn't always call and some ordering services won't refund you and will only give you a 50% off your next order which is useless.</Text>

Loved it! Ate there the other night w/a Pakistani friend who introduced me to this place. We had 2 dishes: the Lamb Biryani and the Chicken Jalferzi. Both are so delicious & substantial, too!
The ambiance of the place is fairly lacking, but go there for the delicious Indian/Pakistani cuisine!</text>

<Review>I am so GLAD that I stopped in to lunch at this sweet family restaurant on Piedmont Avenue! The atmosphere is warm, friendly, and wonderfully old-timey. Nothing artificial or trendy about this place, it is an authentic, seriously delicious Indian food experience! The food is incredibly tasty, well seasoned, nice portion sizes, great service, excellent value, especially yummy lamb koorma, daal, naan, chai tea. I look forward to having dinner there soon, when we can try their other specialities, with friends.< /Review>< Pics>

Ordered food from here through Doordash, specified Mild (for my kids) but it arrived super spicy.  When I called to complain, they agreed the order was specified as Mild.  When I asked for either a refund or a replacement, they refused saying that was Doordash's Orleans but theirs.  No accountability.  1 star for terrible service.</Text>

Be alert before you have food - This is the one of the irresponsible people, who are maintaining this hotel. I had a very bad experience with this restaurant on May 11. I had a dinner with my family. In one of the item I found 1 inch size plastic item, which has very sharp edges. Luckily we found it in advance. But management response for this issue is very bad..😡😡😡 be careful before you visit.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>The employees were super nice. My favorite dish is the vegetarian samosas they are so good with the red sauce which is sweet and the green sauce which is a little spicy. I would totally recommend this restaurant to anybody who loves Indian food as much as I do. The chai tea is also so very taste. It has spices which want to make you dance you heart away and make you feel warm and cozy.< /Review>< Pictures>

Plus they're never on time. Always say 25 minutes and it always takes at least 40. Very annoying.

<Review>I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy my food from Raj Indian Cuisine. I found it bland and lacking in flavor and seasonings. I ordered saag paneer and tikka masala and I requested spicy because I can take very hot food. I eat a lot of Indian cuisine and even know how to cook a few dishes myself. This was a waste of money and taste buds.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

If there were ZERO star rating I'd give it.  This restaurant is 2 miles from my house.  I ordered online via GrubHub.  Raj Indian Cuisines acknowledged my order, charged my credit card, and gave an estimated delivery time of 45 minutes.  After 1 hour and 10 minutes and NO FOOD, I called GrubHub who called Raj Indian Cuisine.  After waiting on hold, GrubHub came back to tell me that this place doesn't deliver to my house because "it's too far".  Two miles is too far??????????????  Never had a chance to eat this food and based on this experience, I NEVER will.<//Review>

Food is fresh and delicious. I ordered the vegi curry not too spicy and it came out just as I hoped for--flavorful with freshly cut vegis and sauce was just right because I can't handle too much spice. And the staff are very pleasant!!5star for customer service. It's 4stars because it doesn't top my number 1 Indian cuisine Swaggat.</review>

They forget an entire item on my order. I only got my chicken biryani, but no lamb vindaloo. Thanks for ripping me off that $16.17< /Review>

<Response>{'time': 1596386906448, 'text': "Saul - I'm sorry about this experience. We did fix your initial problem which was an oil cooler that was leaking badly. We still have the old part if you would like to take it. Regarding the water pump, we don't try to scam anyone. We pressure tested your car and noticed water coming from the weep hole on the water pump when examining from underneath the car. Hopefully it was just the bleeder screw leaking and running down the front of the engine/water pump. If so we apologize, and I'm glad it worked out for you."}< /Response>< Rate>

<text>Update #2:Better Business Bureau Reported, it seems this wasn't the first time they tried to scam someone at this location for a water pump when not needed. Glad i went else where.

Update: When the repair was done but issue remained, i took back to meineke they said i needed a new water pump at $500. I got second opinion this is exactly what my second opinion said:

Check out the pic Saul, I found your thermostat bleed screw leaking. I ordered a new one (cost $50) then I have to retest for any other leaks. Ill let you know what I find.

Dropped my Dodge Challenger off on the 7/27/2020, picked it up on the 7/29th/2020 around 11am. The issue was not fixed after paying $1065. On top of that, they left my engine cover in car in the back seat that still had residue  of oil, coolant etc. Also on top of opening the hood to check things out, they left a 8mm head attached to a bolt in my engine. Very poor value, not to profesional standard at this location unfortunately. BTW if you neex your 8mm head, call me!< /text>< UserId.>

Had never been in for service, but decided to give a try when another servicer was unable to accommodate me that day. I was already way behind on getting my oil changed and had no other days off for awhile, so gave them a try. They were so friendly and were able to help me right away. Also gave me a list of things to get done, but were not pushy and didn’t use scare tactics to get it done then and there. I will be back for future repairs!< /review>

<review>Heather and Scott were our heroes yesterday. At 6PM on Friday, we had a nail in our front right tire of our Tesla. We received the best service which was very friendly, and allowed us to be able to go back to our home safely. Meineke gave us a very nice and caring service after we got rejected help (for a very simple fix) by Wheel Works since we didn’t have the actual Tesla key but we had both phone and valet parking mode by Tesla. Scott was super creative and he found a way to fix the tire without even having to drive the car, he also took a very short time to fix it.

I have used this shop to change my oil for years. 5 months ago they stripped my drain plug. Since then oil has continually been leaking. When I went back to get it fixed I met a few people there who were having the same exact problem. They tried to fix it three times and it is still leaking. They told it leaks because my car has over 200,000 miles and the metal on the drain pan was old. This is ridiculous metal doesn't just get old, it was damaged. They wanted to charge me $450 to change the whole drain pan that they broke. I got the drain pan for only $100 so they want to charge $350 just for labor. They should be covering all the cost because they stripped it. However, they just keep LYING about it and trying to blame other shops when I've been going there for years. Don't trust anyone there, they will brake your car and lie to your face about it .I will never go back! LIARS, LIARS, LIARS.

Update: What can you lie about now with the pictures I added. It's clear the threads were damaged they are just about gone completely. This is not normal wear. Someone did this and they all lied about it.<//text>
<response>{'time': 1537831345416, 'text': "Seeing as how you see fit to write the same negative review twice under different names, I will repeat the facts. Your oil pan threads are worn. It does happen from time to time, especially when you have over 200,000 miles and have had many oil changes done at many different shops. I'm sorry you don't like to hear this but that is the truth. We tried multiple times, at no cost to you, with 2 different mechanics - to try to address the leak so that you wouldn't have to replace your oil pan, but at the end of the day none of those fixes were able to overcome the fact that your threads are worn. As far as the labor, I looked up the quote that we provided you - it is $256 for labor, not $350 that you mention above."}<//response></record></dataset><record>

I recently moved and this is no longer my local Meineke but I make the drive to this specific location at Westgate because of Anthony. Over the years of work I have gotten here I know I can trust Anthony and his team. I have been going here for years with my older Subaru. Mostly just the routine basics getting fluids and brakes done here. I recently bought a newer used car (2011) that I had no history on and I admitted that when I walked in. I had asked for the engine, trans, and diff oils to be changed. Anthony said they will do the engine oil and check the other fluids as well as do a full inspection that comes with a synthetic oil change. I got a call when it was done with some good news. He said that whoever I bought the car from took really good care of it and that the other fluids all look clean and new. When I went to pay he noticed that I had a bunch of points racked up from all my visits over the years. I ended up finally using my points and getting my full synthetic oil change and amazing service that I can trust for a whopping 11$. If there was ever a chance to up-sell some work it would have been this car that I had no history on. Anyways thanks to Anthony for always taking care of my cars and I will be back in a few thousand miles!</review>

<Text>I brought my car in for a window repair, they diagnosed my car for 165 I asked before hand what’s the most I can leave paying if the diagnostic is already 165? They didn’t answer me. Then when I do finally get the quote the lady confused the labor price and the parts prices. Which felt like a scam because she didn’t want me to haggle with the prices. Overall I didn’t get much help. I asked for a diagnostic from the mechanic didn’t get to talk to him.

I love this service shop. When I relocated to California, nearly 5 years ago from Texas, I have chosen businesses that are honest with women, takes the time to explain things, charges reasonable rates and does quality work.  The team here exhibits all those traits and more. They have cared for my car for all general maintenance including replacing my tires and battery. I drive 40 minutes from my home to use them. A friendly and professional team and I highly recommend them.
Thank you for the opportunity to give my feedback.</text>

I am so thankful for Meineke.  They really take good care of my car and me.  The staff is super friendly and professional.  They will not just change things or tell you that you should change things to charge more, like I have been overcharged at other places.  They are honest and trustworthy.  And I love the fact that I receive everything in a text message about the inspection and repairs of my car.
Thank you Meineke for your great service.< /Review>

I've been coming to this place over 10 years. I use to live at Hamilton apt which is literally cross street but though I've been moving around like blossom hill, Sunnyvale, just about everywhere in bayarea but find myself landing here because simply put... They are reliable, and people work there are very professional. THEY ARE ALSO VERY ECONOMICAL.</review>

I’ve been a frequent customer of Meineke at Hamilton Avenue, San Jose (I have 7 cars). The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. They have a waiting room and Anthony (store manager) always have some cool movies playing on to pass the time while your car is getting fixed. Highly recommend!<//review>

I couldn't be happier with my first experience with Meineke. The staff at the San Jose shop by the mall were excellent. They were very honest and although I was worried that a diagnostic would turn into a really expensive ordeal I couldn't afford, they were exceptional. They not only did the diagnosis but they took it upon themselves to fix my AC unit themselves without any additional charges. I was so happy when I received the return phone call saying your car is fixed and all ready to go.

I live in Seattle, WA and my mother and I decided to take a road trip down here to Saratoga to visit family. In the process our AC unit went out and we literally died driving through Redding as it was 100+ degrees. Not knowing how expensive these repairs could be, I was apprehensive. But these guys are the bomb!

I would highly recommend using their services! Complete satisfaction is an understatement. Thank you guys so much!< /text>

The service are good. All contact are friendly.
The case I have are car do not start.
The tester will not go on the test without replace the battery.  I known my battery are ok. Since I do need the car fixed without tow to my home. I agreed to replace the battery.
And shop want to replace all water host and cooling.  This had nothing to do with what the problem was.
At the end I have a bill of  over thousand dollars before I can get the car back drive to other shop to fix real problem.
By fixing unneeded part cost me a lot more this time.</text>

The duo of Anthony and Rea were very helpful in getting my car up and running again. Brought it in on a Thursday night and the next morning Anthony kept me updated step by step on the diagnosis and eventual repair of my car. Great team over there. Will definitely come back again.< /review>

Extremely fast oil change service. I drove 13 miles from mountain view as the meineke around me had bad reviews. I was late for my appointment but these guys took care of my oil change in less than 10 minutes and were very friendly! Highly Recommended.< /Review>

<text>My check engine light was on. Another place said my EGR valve was bad, but noticed some worn and loose vacuum hoses and wondered why they didn’t mention that.
I decided to get a diagnostic somewhere and remembered this Meineke from before and needed a tune-up any way.
Sure enough was just the hoses. Drove around about 80 miles with no problems and engine light is still off.
Saved about 2 or 3 hundred dollars.<//text>< pics>

Had an appointment for oil change service and when I arrived to have service done I was told they were running behind...like 2 1/2 hours. The problem is this is the second time this has happened. What is the point of making an appointment if they can't manage their workflow better I suggest doing first come first served instead. End of story I didn't leave my car and I won't be back.<//review>

I scheduled a 9:30 AM appointment. The oil change took over two hours to complete and they only finished by 11:45 because I told them I had an 11:45 appointment I was going to be late for (which I was). When the man pulls my car around when it was finally ready he backs my car into a shopping cart! And to top the whole experience off, they said they couldn’t clear my oil change light because “their manager had to do it and he wasn’t there” so I’d have to come back another day to have it done. Horrible service.<//review>

I highly recommend this auto shop, for it's top notch customer service, and for doing excellent work on my car. I had an emergency situation, the clutch was out in my PT Cruiser and I needed it urgently fixed, we dropped in after noon and they were able to fix the car same day. I very much appreciated the professionalism displayed, the staff didn't try to up-sell us on parts/services that were not needed; instead they got the job done and now the car runs great! If your looking for an excellent place for maintenance or repairs – look no further!</review>

I couldn’t be happier after getting my wife’s pilot back. It needed a lot of work done. Timing belt, water pump, crank shaft seals, control arms, tires, brake flush, oil change, and then the alignment. Dropped it off on Friday, in hopes they could get it finished Saturday. I asked if they could get it all done in a day, and expressed how I knew it was a lot of work to do, but our pilot is our only family vehicle. Ria said she’d try her best to make it happen. She said she’d have the pilot worked on as a tandem job, so while the timing belt was being done, someone else would be doing the control arms and tires. She was very patient and understanding while my tired and hungry 3 year old sat on the counter while we prepped the “surgery for the car”. And. I added up everything I needed to get done and estimated it to $3,200-$3,500. So my wife and I were aiming to get it all done at or under $3,000. Guess what. $250 under budget!! And they fixed it all the same day. Drives like a champ!</Review>

I came in for an oil change on 3/2/2020. Everything is good except for the clean up. My car door handle, the hand grip inside of the door, the gear shift knob, and the steering wheel are covered in car oil.

Last impression is what count and how you keep your customers. Need to do better.</review>

I am amazed and impressed by the work and the service that Anthony ( Tony) did. My mom works next store at sylvan and she has taken her car to Tony for a few minor things and she recommended Meineke when my car suddenly broke down. I wasnt so sure but I agreed to give it a try. WOW. SO glad I did. When we explained the problem with the car to Tony he immediately said he thought he knew what was wrong but would look at it anyway. We had the car towed to Meineke, Tony called to let us know he got the car. That on it's own was so nice. An hour or so later Tony called again and explained exactly what was wrong and what options we had and his recommendations. I needed a knew alternator, serpentine belt and an oil change. Tony did all that work in one day and I had my car back that evening! And all at a price I could afford. This place is top notch and Tony you have earned a customer for life . I can not say enough good things about the service and the work you did. My car runs like it's new. I will definitely be bringing my car back for maintenance and whatever else happens. SO HAPPY!!!<//text>

Took my car in the other day, these people charged me almost $200 to simply look at my car just to tell me hours later they don’t know what’s going on with it. Then still proceeded to throw numbers at me for costs considering they just said they couldn’t figure out the issue, and that they weren’t even for certain if the estimates they were throwing my way would fix the problem. Why would I pay more money for something that isn’t going to fix the problem ? Very disappointed and feel taken advantage for my money.<//Text>

Great friendly, knowledgeable staff and good quality service. I have taken my last three cars here and I have never been dissatisfied with the service. The work has always been done in the time promised and the price is as expected for this kind of place. I like that it feels like you are at a neighborhood mechanic instead of a big chain but the assurance that the big chain stands behind the work is comforting.</Text>

My husband’s car needed a lot of work, and Meineke did their usual amazing job to get it running, and hopefully pass smog.  The car runs better than it has for many years,</review>

I've have been using Meineke for the past six years and during all this time I've had not one incident where I have not been completely satisfied with their work and their interaction with me and helping me to understand my vehicle. I would recommend Meineke to anyone that needed any type of repair done.<//Text>

STAY AWAY from Meineke!!! I went to have a water leak fixed. The owner of the shop in West Gate said they would do a complete diagnostic to tell me what needed fixing. I get told it was a small hose that they fixed for free. And they came up with a bunch of other stuff they said I should take care of right away. I left their shop and went two blocks home. The next day I went to the Pruneyard which is less then 8 miles away. I was overheating when I pulled in. After waiting an hour for the car to cool, I went back to Meineke and talked to the manager. He said he didn't have time to look at it today(it was Friday about 4) but I should drop it off so they can do a diagnostic to find the problem. I said I already paid you guys 80 bucks to do a diagnostic and you need to do it again? He said they my not have done a complete diagnostic. They may have started and stopped when they found the water leak. I asked about the COMPLETE diagnostic I already paid for and was told they needed to do it again. I was ma's so I left and wanted to talk to the owner the next day. Saturday I talked to the owner and he said the same as his manager. They want to charge me again to do what they said they did just a couple of days before. I was offered no refund no apologies. I emailed the corporate office and got no reply. I sent another email a couple of days later. Still no reply. 3 more emails in the next week and no reply. I called customer service and got no help or a return phone call I was told I would get. I ended up replacing my thermostat on the side of the freeway after overheating again. I never heard from the owner I has talked to at the beginning nor did I hear from the corporate office. Meineke doesn't care at all what their franchises do. STAY as far away as you can. It's not worth wasting the time or the money just to get screwed over by another big corporation. I would give a negative star if I could.</text>

{'time': 1568054989777, 'text': 'This is from service done back in January of 2018. I will post the same reply that I did back then:\n\nMonte - you came in complaining of a coolant leak. We replaced a torn hose at no charge for the part and a minimum labor charge. We tested your car, making sure that it reached normal operating temperature and stayed there.\n\nHowever when you picked up your car we advised you that the your radiator and coolant were extremely rusty and recommended a coolant flush, and that you likely would continue to have issues if you didn’t address this.\n\nYou declined to have this service but told us how happy you were with how we quickly addressed your coolant leak at a very fair price. Your prior review reflects this.\n\nI’m sorry your car overheated. We did address the issue you came to see us about, and recommended further service which was declined. However I’m willing to waive the diagnostic fee for this new issue and take a look at what is causing the problem. I would appreciate however that you take a hard look at what you wrote above and correct multiple inaccuracies.'}</Resp>

<Review>Anthony was super helpful! I came in a rush I. The morning before work and he took the time to make sure I got out of there fast. It was just a tire pressure sensor but my wife had to get to work an hour away and he realized I was stressing out and took the time to check my car and get me out of there and onto work in time. Much appreciated!!< /Review>< user_name>

I have brought my old clunker Honda into this Meineke many times and have always been happy with the results and the price. But I want to give a special shout out to the front desk- Anthony and Rea. Their attitude and service has been terrific. Yesterday, I had a complex issue to deal with. My starter went dead in a parking lot and I had to have my car towed to Meineke. I was unable to stay with the car, so I left the key in the car. I called Meineke and gave Rea a heads-up on what was going on. I called in again this morning. Anthony found the key (the towing company had hidden it in the car) . He had the car checked out, confirmed a defective starter and called me back. He got me a replacement and had it installed in a matter of hours. Really great service!<//Review>

Close proximity to my house, they're always busy so it's best to make an appointment. I've been to this location a few times and have zero complaints! They're very competent in their work and they even make sure to apply any and all coupon or discounts for any services you're getting. I take both of my vehicles (car & SUV) you them for all my light service needs ( fluid changes, tire rotations) if you're looking for a dependable service shop that won't shaft you on prices and actually do the work you want them to do, this is a reputable shop to choose.

- did not have 0 W 20 synthetic blend available (even though I noted that in the appointment notes), used 5 W 20 instead; for my car, manual states only 0 W 20!

<text>I didn't want to go in detail , but since you asked:  I had repaired my car couple of times from your Meineke shop.
First time, it was for a flat tire. During the inspection, mechanic at Meineke suggested me to replace my break pads and i agreed for that. Later I got a phone call saying other components needs to be replaced and it's not safe to drive the car without changing. Meineke charged me more than $600 which i found way to expensive later ( totally my fault in agreeing for that price as i didn't do my research) . The part really unprofessional was that , My stopping distance after the changing break pad was very high and i was hearing noises when i brake. I took my car back and the front desk staff was really not listening about what i wanted to say, and the conclusion was to drive car for some more miles and see. When the brake was not working as expected , i took it again and they found it was some loose components inside. I felt driving with a worn break pad was better than repairing and driving with loosely fit break pads
Second time: Constant oil change warning came before my scheduled service appointment  at another shop. I came for oil change to Meineke .Same unfriendly response from front desk staff.  Never wanted to respond to any questions asked. (It's up to you how you want to treat your customers and i am ok with it ). Charged me for filter change along with oil change. What i found from my appointment at service center 3 days after my oil change at Meineke was that the filter was never changed and i had to change it again.

Third Time : Found a nail on my car tire and wanted to know if it can be repaired or how much it will cost me to replace the tires. As expected, front desk staff was so busy (even though only one customer sitting there ) and very unfriendly in answering any of my queries.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

We first aligned your car almost 16 months ago, back in April of 2018. When you came in this week and complained about pulling we did a free alignment check first so that we could see what was going on. Our assessment was that the vehicle had hit a curb (multiple times) based on the toe angle of both tires being way out of spec, and damage on the front wheel covers. The warranty does not cover this or if your suspension/ride control has obvious issues that need to be corrected. We did try to help you out by giving you a $15 discount off of this alignment. We corrected your toe angle on both tires and notified you that due to your directional tires and tire wear you will continue to experience slight pulling. This is all documented on your invoice. We thought we were being fair and upfront, and didn't get the sense you were unhappy. Hopefully you will reflect on above and give us another chance."}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Worst experience ever. Went in for an alignment after car was pulling to the right...left with the car still pulling the exact same way. I went in a second time to get it fixed ....it should have been covered under warranty but they didn't honor it and I had to pay again. Left the second time with the car still pulling to the right. $200 dollars later.</text></record>

I highly recommend this auto repair center. I purchased my new tires, an alignment, brakes, and oil change. Timely, competitive, and professional. Anthony(manager) communicated effectively and with out any "sales" pressure. Answered all my questions, "pros and cons"... including "Thai Tea-50%-w/BLACK PEARLS."-A+. Thank you Anthony!
As well as Heather...aka "Showgirl", who helped steward my transaction. She was customer service oriented with a ready smile and... a willing singer and hand dancer.-A+. Thank you Heather!
Thank you Meineke You appear to have a top notch team. That was my experience.  I am not fond of writing reviews, but they deserved it... better yet they earned it. Thanks Again!!!</review>

<name>David Smith</name><date>1564421085256</date><rating>5< /rating><review>I've been going to this Meineke for almost 5 years. They're not after quick expensive fixes, their whole model is around maintenance and trying to stop things from breaking. That said they can tackle any job and I feel they've looked out for me, well obviously since I would have stopped going there a long time ago if I didn't trust them, there's plenty of options. They turn repairs around within the time they estimate, have flexible pickup and dropoff options, and do quality work. They've also been around with the same owner for a very long time compared to other places which either go out of business or need to change owners because they can't keep their customers. Highly recommend.</review>< pictures>

We took the car to a local mechanic and even to a Toyota dealership to be repaired. After a few trips, leak was finally patched. My daughter came home, called me freaked out that her car was leaking oil again. I’ve been to the Meineke on Hamilton a few times to get oil changes and instructed my daughter to take her car there. She got to the shop, explained to the manager her situation and within 10 minutes they had her car on a lift. After inspecting the car for a few minutes, the technician came back and told her that the leak was only condensation from the AC. They didn’t even charge her for the time spent. She got in and out in under 30 minutes and left feeling that she received great personalized service.

Thank you Meineke for everything!<//review><user>109388911924317329167<//user><Time>1570681463726</Time><user_name>Ismail Chaudhry<//user_name>< pictures>

I've been bringing my car here for a few years for oil changes and service and have always been satisfied. I believe that a little maintenance goes a long way in avoiding future problems. My car had been running rough and they were able to diagnose what it needed and now it runs like new. It doesn't hurt that Nordstrom Rack is a right there to occupy my time while my car is serviced.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Had a suspected nail in the tire of my 2013 Jaguar, so I urgently called Meineke to see if they could fit me in.  "Ria" was absolutely polite and understanding of my situation, and was able to get me in on such short notice.  The team inspected the tires, and found that all 4 were low on pressure, but no nail in the front left as I suspected.  They filled and checked again, and all was good within an hour.  Unbelievably, the charge for their service was $0!  They do not need to print "Honesty and Integrity" on their invoices... These guys live it every day, and they have a new customer in me.  Thank you Meineke team!<//Review></record>

I don't usually write reviews but I just have to give the service team at the Meineke Car Care by the Westgate Mall a BIG SHOUT OUT for their great customer service!  They are very thorough and explains everything clearly.    I don't feel pressured to do repairs and they will advise on which concerns need to be done sooner.  Takes away the anxiety going into a repair shop!< /review>

<Text>Been having both me and my husbands car regular oil change and repairs here, This place was a total package!!! From  nice, clean and comfortable waiting area and restrooms to good service(not to mention their amazing and wonderful staffs!). Specially to Ria and Anthony they are both very accommodating and are very concern with you and your vehicle, but not to the point that they made you felt obliged to have all the repairs done right at that moment. They also gave you  recommendations and certain options  on how to deal with some minor problems. Prices are reasonable and even offer great discounts as well. Overall I do recommend this place and will be forever customer. Keep up the good work guys!<//Text><date>1545531906938</date></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>They charge $29.95 for inspections. Satisfaction is not very important to them . They are a franchise and the girl behind the counter is more concerned at looking at her phone while speaking to a customer. I told the mechanic there I need brakes,calipers and roaters. How much would it be to get that done? He told me we won't know until we look at it.  I informed  him what I needed done but they insisted on an inspection anyways. So apparently a quote is $29.95. Save yourself time and money go somewhere else. When you call the call center they will inform you it is a free inspection.  There are no free quotes or inspections.  Buyer BEWARE! A real good indication of bad customer service is when there employees are on there  personal cell phones while a customer is speaking to them!! That is why I left!

Update tried to come back  and give them a chance the employees were rude and told me to go somewhere else.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1553797938594, 'text': "Katrina - I'm sorry you weren't satisfied with your service. I'm not sure who you spoke to in the Meineke call center, but brake inspections are never free. This was explained to you up front when you came in to the store, and you agreed to the $29.95 fee. It takes time to remove all of your tires, take measurements, and inspect the action of your calipers. As was explained to you, if you have us do the work then the fee is waived. My understanding is you were demanding that we match the verbal quote you received from another shop. Anthony went out of his way and got to within $30 of their quote, using OEM (original) quality parts. Compare this with what you told Anthony the other shop was going to use - O'Reilly brake components. We stopped using their brake parts years ago because of too many quality/comeback issues. I'm sorry you don't feel you were treated fairly but we offered you a fantastic deal with high quality parts. You always have the choice to go elsewhere, which you did, but please don't criticize us for holding our standards on using quality components and charging a reasonable cost."}< /Response><gmapID>0x808fcaacc199134b:0x5809d5b9d3daaf5c</gmapID></record>

<review>Usually, I receive 5-star service from this Meineke. However, I can no longer rate them this way, and observing the reviews in Google, I know the owner will take offense as no accountability is ever taken. I went in for an oil change and general diagnostic/tire rotation on October 1. Apparently, nothing was mentioned about my battery and it was said to be in "good condition".  5 DAYS LATER, my battery died and I practically spent the whole day rectifying the situation which wasted my entire Saturday. We called the 'fantastic' Meineke Roadside Assistance program, which gave us an HOUR AND A HALF estimate to come and tow our car to Meineke (which was a mile and a half away). We decided to cancel this and go with AAA. We received terrible customer service over the phone and demanded to speak to a manager when we tried to cancel the Meineke Roadside Assistance. They told us that they didn't "recognize" the phone number. Anyways, back to the Meineke mechanic: once AAA came through (only after a half hour mind you), Anthony was able to work on the car immediately. When we suggested that the work 5 days ago may not have been thorough, he became defensive and dismissive.

Even though the battery was clearly 5 years old and had visible corrosion all over it, NOTHING was mentioned at the oil change and diagnostic, but he claimed that when he tested the battery, no red flags were risen. IN FACT, the AAA battery technician who came to jump our car told us that if we brought in this car so recently to Meineke, then they probably didn't check it thoroughly enough as the battery was clearly in need of replacement. When I told this to Anthony, he trivialized the Battery Tech's job at AAA and said he was "just a tow truck driver" and that he basically didn't know what he's talking about (even though his position is that of BATTERY TECH and he does this everyday). How 'professional' of Anthony. This screams to me two possibilities: (1): Meineke needs to update its processes when testing batteries as they're inadequate
(2): The service provided was not thorough
When I suggested this to Anthony, and I told him that I'd rather complain to him directly and not via Yelp or Google reviews, he smugly told me "well, yeah, you'd have no reason to." And then he continued to be defensive--this was after I was speaking with Rhea (a front desk person who wasn't particularly helpful and rather rude who was more concerned about talking to Anthony about how much sugar to put in her coffee instead of helping me when I was standing right in front of her) who was also defensive. I have to say that this will be my last visit to Meineke as they do not do a thorough job; have sub-par customer service; and do not take accountability.

UPDATE: I directly called Meineke and I was hung up on three times by Anthony Trayer. I was told that "there's nothing else to say" and he condescendingly mentioned that he wishes me "good luck on my journey." No apologies, no "thank you for for the $1000s of dollars you've spent here", nothing. TO  THE OWNER: If you really care about your business, then you'll need to put your staff through customer service training as this is unacceptable. I want Anthony reprimanded and held accountable for his horrible customer service skills and his lack of his attention to detail.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1570811887462, 'text': 'James - I’m sorry this happened to you.

Dishonest place! Changed a 3 year old Interstate battery on Thursday afternoon, that had a 6years waranty.  Lied to their teeth about a prorated refund. Even claiming that Interstate picked it up when I asked for it back the next morning. To take it to the previous garage that was willing to give me a partial refund. Called the local Interstate shop that directly deals with them and they told me that they did not pick it up. Last pick up was Monday and today is Friday.  Liars.  The guy had the nerves to tell me why I looked and sounded upset! Because you are liars and people are not stupid!
To the credit of the owner.  I was given a prorated refund on the credit card, after the above review.  I changed my rating from 1 to 2 stars, because I still do not care for the original treatment as well as my effort and frustration .  It is not only about the money but also the principle.< /review>

Reasonable and somewhat patient people. I really want to give them a good rating but the oil change I had an appointment for on a Tuesday morning took over 2 hours. Not worth the few dollars saving.

They also put the oil change reminder for 2k mi. Not sure if a mistake or on purpose.<//review>

UNSAFE, & UNTRUSTWORTHY. I had some work done at this location, a few days later one of my wheels fell off my truck on the highway. They took DAYS to return my call(s). You would think that an incident such as a wheel falling off on the highway would warrant a faster response. The truck became inoperable, they told me it was my fault, (like I was the one who over torqued the studs) wheels do not just fall off. They left me stranded in AZ. The only offer I got was to replace the wheel to make the car roll again. The driver door got slammed by the impact of the tire so the door didn't work anymore, plus the other body damage associated with the incident (bumpers, lights, inner paneling trim pieces ect).
For weeks I had to rent a car to get to work while the owner tried to figure out a way to escape responsibility. There was no integrity displayed on behalf of Meineke, an absolute shame.

This location is an absolute nightmare. If you are traveling with kids or loved ones, or even just like the car you have, DO NOT LET THEM SERVICE IT!!< /Text>

I've been coming here for 2 years. Great customer service. I like that when they do the oil change, they give you a print out sheet of what needs attention next and in the future. Anthony and Reea are very helpful.

< Review>
I’ve been going here for a few years now and every time has been a pleasure. The two friendly faces at the front desk (Anthony and Ria if you’re lucky) are always nice and very genuine about what is needed with the car. I always appreciate the service report they provide after each oil change as it keeps me up to date with the wear and tear of my brakes, tires, lights, and all the little things I may not pay attention to between visits.

I have recieved numerous oil changes, I got my brakes done, and I had a bunch of the vacuum lines replaced in my WRX. I never second guess their work and the turn around times are usually pretty quick. I have never had anyone attempt to sell me services that were unnecessary.

Also I don’t think you can beat their prices for a oil change. They also seem to always have some type of coupon online if you check.</Review>

< Review>
I have been coming to Meineke for about a year now and both Anthony & Ria have been very helpful each time.  I don't feel any pressure sale like at the other shops I've been to.  They explain services and recommendations clearly and prioritize work needed for my Subaru.  I am so happy I found this place.  I have spoken to other customers who are waiting in their lobby and they too are very happy with their service. If you are trying to find a place you can trust, try Meineke on Hamilton Ave by Westgate Mall!  I would give this place a 10 STARS if they let me!!  =)<//Review>

I was not happy with the service here and will take my business else where. I set up an appointment for 7:30AM right when they open, so my car could be done in an efficient time.  Well not as I planned, they didn’t have the filter in stock for my car so they had to get it from another shop. I would assume you check your inventory for scheduled appointments. I believe that’s the whole purpose of setting appointments to be ready for the client. So I left because it would take longer than expected. They never called me after almost two hours. I had to contact them turns out the car was ready but they had been trying to put a headlight bulb back, that they took out. I don’t think you need to take a headlight bulb out to do an oil change. You need to consultant the client first and let them know a headlight is out before even touching it. I could be wrong but that gives me the idea that it was messed with, because my headlights worked fine in the morning when I arrived and they were installed brand new August of 2017. Luckily I have warranty and won’t be paying this shop to replace my bulb. Of course when my fiancé arrived they were struggling to put the bulb back into place. Overall won’t do business here. Leaving this review here and also putting it for the Yelpers. Have a nice day.</Text>

It seems like there was a miscommunication as you told us your girlfriend would pick up the car. She came in about an hour after we called her.\n\nIf you look at your inspection report, the bulb was noted as out at check in (first thing we check are horn and lights). Our service advisor pulled the bulb out to show your girlfriend that it was indeed burned out. There was no struggling as it is a push in and twist bulb.\n\nWe really have no reason to lie or "mess" with your bulb, not a big money maker for us. We did call you the next morning to follow-up after we saw your review - we didn\'t get any sense of dissatisfaction from your girlfriend at checkout, she seemed generally nice and  positive about how we were trying to help.

I went this morning to get an oil change and as usual the staff is AMAZING!!!! This morning i told Anthony that the service notification came on and he assured me that it would be taken care of.  Anthony deliveres as promised everytime.  Anthony also continues to educate me on my car and cars in general to ensure i can understand how cars work and whats next for my car.  I will continue to go here eventhough i live in Hollister.  The team is is ALWAYS fantastic, thank you guys for all you do....<//text>

I changed my oil here and it has  been leaking ever since. They stripped the drain plug bolt. I went Back three times and they still can't fix the problem.  The oil is still leaking now and I will never be going back to this shop again.< /review>

With over 200K miles on your car and many oil changes at I’m sure many different locations, it is not unexpected. We tried to help you a couple of different ways, both an oversized drain plug, a heli coil and a tapered plug, but unfortunately nothing is going to fix worn threads on your pan other than replacing the pan.'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fcaacc199134b:0x5809d5b9d3daaf5c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I will never go anywhere else. I love John and Ria. They are always quick to help and always take in my car overnight when something happens last min. They explain things very well and always figure out what is wrong. I have never had to bring back my car for the same issue. Thank you guys and the techs. Without you, I'd be walking lol.<//Review>

Edit 4/2021: very disappointed in my experience here. We brought our car in for a  synthetic oil change. We scheduled our appointment at 8:45, finished check in at 9, was told it'd take an hour, and didn't get our car back until 11:30 and they didn't even call us to let us know (WE had to call them to ask). They also charged us extra for needing cartridge oil change instead of the apparent standard - it would have been nice if they had called to inform us of this beforehand. In addition, the tire pressure light turned on right before our appointment and they said they pumped it and that it was probably just the cold air. However, the next day our tire pressure light went off again so pretty sure it's more than just the cold air and it feels a little frustrating that they didn't properly inspect our tires.

2016: Very nice workers who were helpful as it was my first time going there and was a little unsure of how things worked. Prices are great (especially for the standard oil change; there are online coupons on their website) and they are very fast and efficient! Got my car oil change done in less than 30 minutes!</Review>

I've been a customer here for years because it just feels right.  More specifically: 1) this place is clean and organized in both the waiting area and the work area (which indicates reliable jobs), 2) the explanations they give me about necessary work make sense, 3) the bills I get are itemized in detail, 4) their computer records have been reliable for me, and 5) their repair jobs come with warranty.< /review>

This establishment is not to be trusted with your car. I have filed complaints with with this location's Manager, Anthony Tayer,  the owner "Bob" , and the corporate office about my dissatisfaction with there're work on my car. "Bob" the owner said he would reimburse me for the cost I paid, but only in future service on my vehicle. But that would mean allowing them to work on my car again, and I am not willing to do that. Corporate said it was out of there hands because it was the responsibility of the owner of that franchise. So you decode,... would you let someone that betrayed your exceptions of professionalism at a sevice center to do work for you?< /Text>

After reading all these reviews I have decided to go for break service here and it turned out to be a total disappointment. They inspected my car for almost 1.5hr then they were whispering for almost 30 minutes and finally gave me an estimate of total 700$ for both front and rear though there is nothing to replace for front just the labour cost. And they were not disclosing the current thickness of pads, just saying need to do all these. Also they were telling that these are breaks it's so confusing. Looks like they aren't sure what to do so they have asked me to do everything. They advertised 50% for all the break parts and charing double amounts somewhere else.</review>

If I could give this auto shop no stars, I WOULD. This shop just really wants your money. We took our car here to get fixed, as it was not running. The manager, Charlie stated that he will get back to us. He calls us a few hours later, and tells us it"ll be about 500 to get it running again and to come by to the shop to discuss further. We went to the shop and he physically showed that the car turned on. However, 5 minutes of running the car, it was heating up. That gave me the impression, they did not really thoroughly inspected the car. We trusted the shop to get our car fixed and was willing to pay whatever the cost was. Charlie says the car will need to stay to overlook the cause of the overheating. well, duh, that was the reason why we brought the car in, in the first place. The next day, charlie calls, and says it will cost 1000 flat to replace a full list he says verbally through the phone. We asked if that list can be emailed. Twice we asked. Twice we verified and confirmed, nothing. No email. Charlie calls back a few hours later and says something else needed to replaced, which will cost another 200. Over thinking everything, my husband and i just wanted the car fixed, so we trusted them to fix EVERYTHING fully. It took a whole day to get our car fixed, and when the time came to pay it ended up being 1330. We were put on the spot, manager saying itll be 1200, to now paying 1330 because of taxes? Of course as customers, we pay because they provided their service. Not even of 10 miles of driving our car, it started over heating. We took the car back at 730 am, the time the shop opened!  That WHOLE day, our car was never looked at!  We had to reach out them just to know the status of our car. CHARLIE, the manager, says he will let his mechanic know what the issue was, as i specifically told him what happened. He said his shop will call us tomorrow. Well, tomorrow has came, and yet again, no call on the status of the car. I had to call!! i talked to someone named Matt. he states that "charlie" aka the manager aka "mechanic specialist" taken a look at the car and says its a water pump issue? which will cost us 2k! THAT RIGHT HERE BLEW ME AWAY! Not even 10miles of driving, and all of a sudden the same issue is happening. AND, why am I speaking with someone other than charlie. aka the manager, aka the mechanic specialist.  Again. I specifically asked to get the list emailed to me. NO EMAIL! my husband and i went to the shop because the manager, charlie has been MIA everytime i try to ask for him. 730am, when it opened i walked in their shop. charlie was not there yet, when i had asked regarding about our car. The man at the desk states, charlie is a customer service specialist and will be right with me. Oh my gosh, OF COURSE. the manager, mechanic  specialist is also a customer service specialist BUT has been MIA the whole time, and i have been speaking to Matt. Charlie finally showed up, and gave us such comforting words. "Yeah im sorry, unfortunately itll cost this much, it started over heating because it was poorly maintained, and things happen, BUT the owner of the shop will be in a few hours, he can do something for you. Maybe fix it for free or half off. I had to head to work, so i gave him  the benefit of the doubt. 3 o clock came around and OF COURSE, NO CALL. i called the shop. Reaching OUT to charlie and OF COURSE, HE IS NOT THERE and OF COURSE IM TALKING TO, U KNOW WHO? MATT! He told me the owner will call me in 5 mins. It took the owner 15 mins to call me and I swear he was giving a bunch of excuses as to why he cant give me exceptional customer service
Offering me 10 to 15 percent off the 2k service to fix my car! How pathethic can this owner be? I demanded for reinbursement for the labor they put in my non driveable car.  As an owner, u make customers happy, and he is all about his damm business and money.i called They are all scam artists, and make you think they will help fix your car!!! They rob you for your money!!! Do not go to these people, they are bad business, i called corporate, and filed papers</text>

This place was just ok. Came here for a couple of oil changes but they always seemed to take longer (45+ minutes) which is on the long side for oil changes. On average they should take only 30 minutes.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Last minute in need of storage space and everything was just not inside my budget.  Trojan storage was not only close to home , but who I really have to give props to is their employee George! This man took me through the smoothest most easy going experience from calling me back on the reservation over the  phone the same day and walking me through the best option of space for me, all in the same day! I recommend nothing else out there for your storage space. I have no doubt that if you leave it up to George he will keep your stuff safe and secure @ TROJAN STORAGE.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Stayed here for three years.  Clean and new facility, but the rent has gotten out of control. Started at 178 per month and ended at 275. Originally, would get quickly returned calls but in more recent times, people often don’t answer or call back.  The office doors are often locked during the day during office hours. This can be inconvenient.  The first month is pro-rated. You are required to give a 30 days notice to leave, but they don’t pro-rate the last month, even though they will likely rent it out quickly and had ample notice.< /review>

These guys are the best!!.  We moved out of state and had movers come to the unit to move our belongs out and the left most of our belongings in the unit.  The staff worked with us to schedule workers to remove the contents and even took a bag with expensive electronics to UPS and mailed to us.<//Text>

<review>State of the art storage. Everything about Trojan is 10x better than other storage facilities.

Applaud the owner and operations. Seriously great deals better facilities than anything you'll find.

Incredible front office service Lachelle and the other front desk person (handsome australian man sorry didnt want to get your name wrong) are seriously perfect. Professional, polite, even headed, customer friendly and while I don't recommend doing this, I had temporarily misplaced keys, had movers come to liquidate my design furnishings and drop off items 2x and due to their tight timeline, 2nd time they couldn't wait to have items stored. Lachelle went above and beyond to make sure my items were secure until I could get them into my storage. That is going way above and beyond.

I purchased 10 queen and king size mattress bags which worked great for all the mattress I was storing for staging.

They have great prices on their protective materials and merchandise. It's well worth the $5 to protect a $1000+ mattress set and it fit the king size mattress and boxspring.

The 2 storage 10x10s I rented were immaculate the facility is very very well run, great ac, no dust literally AT ALL, no moisture and I can't have it as humidity ruins furnishings. Well lit, safe, the security codes they have you create for each storage garage controls both the front gate and access to the elevator and keys your smart garage know you're on your way there to access your garage.

I am a super happy customer. Not paid to do this review!!! Just relieved I found you guys when I really needed it and it feels really clean and safe.  Also not crowded though it has the capacity. Smart use of space for lockers that you can keep files in though I needed more space for furnishings.< /review>< Pics>

<text>This is the best kept secret in Burbank. Absolutely wonderful place, top notch. Maybe a little pricey, but it's well worth it. Staff is superb, security is excellent (both electronic and physical), and the climate control works great. I feel comfortable and secure with my things here.

Trojan storage is fantastic. Very clean, I never see any trash on the ground. Very safe, your lock is not the only form of protection for your items, in fact many lockers don’t even have a lock on them. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Oh and the reason I found them in the first place, climate control! I know my items will not get warped or harmed in any way by the scorching hot weather of a valley summer.</Text>

Hello I just love the staff here are so polite nice and respectful I love the way they conduct their business and I love the business hours of access until 9 p.m. I wish I could be extended longer sometimes after the holidays I'm running late on my bill payment lost my bank card over the holiday had to order order another one and I missed going to the storage to discuss it them but I'm sure they'll be understanding and it'll all be taken care of anyway I would recommend Trojan storage to anybody I've already referred a few of my friends so I hope that you will want to rent here too also they have double security I just love the security features that they have here on their storage units cuz you can punch your code in at the door and it unlocks your your storage unit if you lock your keys in side or something like that you can still get in your unit I think that's a great feature don't you anyways enjoy your day and have a very smooth day this is Donna Walker< /review>

<Text>I stopped by on Wednesday because the website said they closed at 9 and when I arrived the store was already closed and I was ok because they guy at the door told me it was closed but by the time I got to my car and turned around he let two other people in . I then when back and told him and he said they were closed that no one was inside the store and I just left it like that. I called today to see their hours and they don’t even pick up the phone. They were so good but now they don’t even update their hours and can’t even let you in after they are closed but let someone else go in. No wonder they don’t have a lot of customers as before< /Text>< pictures>

I am disappointed with the management. After spending 42 dollars and some change, I was given the dollars folded up and would never suspected the store owners son to deliberatly short change me by 10 dollars. Only to return fir my change and find out that his mother who owns the corporation lies for herself and for her son. She insisted that he would never do anything like that. Of course not thats her son. Wrong everyone is capable of skimming if they think they would get away with it.< /text>

We were seated toward the edge of the patio, which had a spectacular view of the vineyard. The goat cheese was phenomenal, and the apples were honey sweet! The wines had subtle accents that did not distract from the wine itself.

Elise was great. She was charming and very welcoming! She studied geology, so she was very informative of the environmental elements that produce the best wine. Great stuff!<//Text>

Nested at the top of a hill, VIANSA winery offers beautiful views of the Sonoma Valley and the Mayacama Mountains.
The wines are very good and affordable. I recommend the Sauvignon Blanc. Excellent service by Gabriel, we were lucky to get a table outside in the terrace, facing the valley and the marshes. The cheese & Charcuterie board was delicious and perfect match to the 4 wines flight we sampled.
Adding this gorgeous place as a must stop on my Sonoma-Napa trips.</text>

Viansa Sonoma Winery 🍷 was my first experience in America in 2010. It was a fabulous experience because I got a chance to taste wine and they taught me how to do it. This is a nice cosy place in San Francisco city. You can taste wine and enjoy it. This is situated in Sonoma Valley and it has a proud history of wine making. It was started by Samuele's grandson in 1989.
I love this place. I feel like going there again.<//text>

Wonderful experience and such a beautiful place. Very worth a visit, and Don was such a great wine educator! Amazing that he came from a gaming background, he was so hospitable and really enjoyed the work and talking with us. The overlook alone is worth the visit, and you add the pizza and live music on weekends in and it makes for a great stop in Sonoma.< /Review>

<Review>We have been club members here for a few years now and love coming back for visits often. This last visit was excellent as usual. They were on top of their mask and social distancing procedures; we felt very safe and relaxed spending the afternoon in the comfy members area. This winery is rare in that I enjoy both their reds AND whites, it’s hard to pick a favorite. The staff is knowledgeable, prompt, and conversational. We can’t wait to come back to enjoy the wines, the views, and the picnic baskets!</Review>< pics>

We booked outlook. We were 30 mins late so they cut short our experience by 30 mins. Michael was very slow and did not provide us coffee beans or chocolate while tasting wine. He also didn’t provide a jar to empty and rinse our glasses at one point suggesting we should just chuck it. Lol. Which my husband did .. being the sport he is. Michael even dropped the knife while coming over to outlook and didn’t replace it. So my husband ended up using his hand with the goat cheese. Experience just not worth the money. Rather go for patio seating. Wine selection is good. I would recommend Sebastini vineyard over this.<//text>

We really enjoyed our tasting at Viansa. The views are amazing. During the pandemic, I felt like the winery was making a significant effort at keeping things safe. The wine was fantastic and the charcuterie board and sandwiches hit the spot.  I would highly recommend visiting Viansa.< /review>

Most beautiful vineyard we went to this past weekend! The winery is stunning and located on a hill top, so the views are incredible. We had a larger group and they couldn’t have treated us any better. The stone fire pizzas were incredible and the salads were so fresh. We were all amazed by this winery and cannot wait to go back! Oh, and they had the best live musician playing on the patio. Thank you Viansa!</Text>

Had such a terrific experience wine tasting with some friends this past weekend. View was absolutely breathtaking, service was great, Elise was so wonderful to us— really made the experience that much better! A must go to if in Sonoma! Also had a pizza station which was delicious and needed after drinking wine all day.< /text>

<Review>We were very excited to enjoy our valentines tasting. Sadly viasna did not meet our expectations. The service was subpar and we were met with sarcastic remarks shortly after we arrived. As the day went the comments went from sarcastic to plain rude. I’ve never experienced this attitude from any service company before. I don’t usually rate companies for poor service unless they were extremely incompetent. 1 star deserved.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>The people here we're so nice and it was a beautiful day/vineyard. We ate lunch on the patio and hung out. They had an area with white picnic tables and grass that had a couple games like Cornhole and croquet.

My husband and I visited on a Monday and it was such a peaceful and enjoyable experience. Everyone was wearing masks and we were able to take them off once seated at our table. The view was great and everyone was exceptionally friendly. Definitely will be going back again <3 Thank you for giving us the perfect tranquil break we needed during these chaotic times, and making us feel safe all the while.< /Review>

Will definitely come back for the views, ambience, and snacks.

~1 hour (39 mi) from SoMa
No Reservations Required
Food available (Pizza, deli)

$15 for Classic Tasting  (4 pours)
$20 for Reserve Tasting (4 pours)
(Waived with two bottle purchase)

Pro:
* Fantastic overall experience
* Fabulous views (see photos)
* Plenty of outdoor seating, including comfortable lounge chairs, high tops, and tables
* Good wine overall, but not particularly notable. My favorite was the 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir.
* Several games, including cornhole and croquet
* Great place for lunch or afternoon snack; They have a wood fired pizza (~$20 pizza) and full deli
* One free pour with Yelp Check-in. The more friendly staff will also happily throw in an extra pour if you ask nicely.

Con:
* Felt too mainstream and touristy, meaning very little emphasis on the wine itself, more on the experience (which was good)
* Staff didn’t seem that knowledgeable about the wine. They couldn’t even tell us which grapes were in the blends, and they had no interest in telling us about the wines.
* One lady in particular was very unfriendly, but luckily there were enough servers we were able to switch.
* Best seating are reserved for wine club members
* A bit pricey compared to it’s neighbors

Being a Napa Native Viansa is hands down a must winery to visit on your Sonoma/Napa trip! The view is beautiful and the wine and staff are always so inviting and knowledgeable. I absolutely adore working with Jeannine and Victoria. They always make the booking process so easy and take excellent care of anyone I send or refer to them.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We had a very pleasant visit to this winery.  We enjoyed that we could take our time with the tastings and sit out in the fresh air over looking the beautiful views, unrushed.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and engaging.  I typically prefer whites, though found 2 reds that I could enjoy here.  Impressive gift shop area inside.  The grounds were breath taking and such a pleasure to enjoy.  We definitely felt like we were in an Italian country side.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNij8o98B6K4eOug3HjG5tS6E4akK8k0DFZ0yXC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-5q_27tPeTDtYd6lNUpzrkKUz8vSalu5RSIAM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxsb9X8ZIRArf_PYofVojg-pkfT6exMaOd9wYW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdHqMPgK53klK31lJmUWUQA6oEnHRedtrZncuQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCCJ90r9AIHcnOPwqBAmXaM1FYy75DCG6TT8Xf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxEfJKo2GEknDvQEh_aP4aZ2pXkeg6w_WmHSW9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNruidlCO62HzzBD2OWVs9WruqsFoaEX37Qb5Uk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwpV4v5tAcobQCNf1mweIEJjR1ea93LzQHRMhZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>{'time': 1562348361708, 'text': "Hi Coraline!

We loved this winery! The views were incredible and the property was gorgeous. There was a ton of seating options spread throughout the winery - tables overlooking the views, picnic tables on the grass, and lots more spots in the shade. The wine was also very good and the staff serving it was very friendly and accommodating. We look forward to returning!< /Text>

As a local, this is one of my favorite wineries in Sonoma.  It's a beautiful property with an absolutely amazing staff!  If you have a chance, book the Private Outlook as it's got the most stunning views in the area.  We were just there for a ladies bachlorette outing and they took such great care of us (btw, they host weddings too).  Thank you so much Viansa!< /Review>

We had a great experience on the winery grounds. The tasting area is cozy and there are great view around the vineyard.</review>

Horrible!! Tried ordering multiple bottles of wine for our one year anniversary (for our wine box), since we visited your winery on our honeymoon last year. Due to a "shipping error" in their warehouse, they wouldn't do anything to try and expedite the order, even though I placed the order more than two weeks before our anniversary. Nikki wouldn't offer any resolution. Horrible experience. Just lost a patron and a customer. Better experience at Mondavi, Truchard, and Madonna!</Text>

We enjoyed our tasting with a younger gal who was very spunky (I cannot remember her name, but she had dark hair and was wearing high wasted black jeans with buttons). At first we were confused when we first came up to the tasting bar (gentleman named Dan started to help us) where we just left at the bar alone intermittently with no explanation of how the tasting worked and not really sure what to do next. We crossed the room and found the gal mentioned above to be very helpful. We also enjoyed a reasonably priced cheese board that was sliced for us and the view as seen in the photo. Overall a great time and we left with two bottles. Would recommend!< /Text>< Pictures>

This is hands down my favorite in Napa/Sonoma. The delicious wine and the intoxicating scenery and outdoor seating area make it the perfect spot to spend an afternoon. Whenever we’re in the area we make sure to stop there and it’s always the best spot.< /review>

<review>Nice vineyard up on the hill near the swamp flats in sonoma. The winery had lots of variety of wine. Nice layout has a simi private booths for 4 to 5 people to drink in style with a great view. The place also has a party hall. Lots of snacks, sandwich , cheese and crackers for our base. Tables indoor and outdoor for tasting wine, or for sitting around and drinking wine or champagne. The winery is a nice place just to visit and look around. It also has lots of lemon trees and other fruit trees if you take a walk around the place. Plus some nice sculptures. Overall a great place.<//review><gmapID>0x8085a5e352f65d45:0xc0b8363aa93ab188< /gmapID>< Pics>

Booked a hilltop gazebo for a my engagement proposal. The staff was very accommodating with helping set up everything and playing along with the surprise. The view and setting were even more beautiful than the photos. We were severed cheese, bread, meats, and of curse wine. All of these were great and it became my Fiance's most memorable day.< /text>

<review>Based on the recommendation of a friend, my girl friend and I made this our final stop in our multi-day Napa & Sonoma trip. Boy, are we glad we did! The views were amazing! Breathtaking truly. Unlike any other view in the region. The service was impeccable. We had a great server with roots in New York state, which is where we hailed from. Atmosphere was laid back and fun, which we enjoyed. Wines were pretty good, too!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1569683701571, 'text': 'Hi Dave!

After a quick tour among the acres of vineyards, we enjoyed varieties of wines in the huge & beautifully decked tasting room with accomodating manager, Kelvin. The wines, both red & white didn't disappoint & the brief orientation before each sip helped me in appreciating it more. Of course, we didn't leave without the prerequisite photo ops at the IG-worthy vine-draped walls 🍁 of the villa. It was magical and romantic with the experience straight out of a Nicholas Sparks novel.♥️ #SanFranciscoStories #LocalGuides #WineTastingFantasy< /Text>< Pics>

Leo was a great guide: very funny and generous. The location was beautiful and had amazing views and photo ops. However, despite all the charm, there is nothing you can do about poor flavour. The wines were all very dry or weak in flavour.<//Review>

I visited Viansa with my family. We spent the whole day wine tasting at different vineyards. Viansa had the most beautiful views and best cozy places to sit outside and enjoy the views. It was very fairly priced and the staff was so friendly. We were helped by Len who went above and beyond to make our experience fun, relaxing, and social! If you like a great red wine and you're in Sonoma you have to visit Viansa!< /Review>

Had an awesome wine tasting with Leo and Michelle. The wines are wonderful. We especially liked the Pinot reserve, Sangiovese and Cabernet franc. We are excited to be new members. We highly recommend this winery for the wines and views.< /review>

I’ve been here 3 times and only had AWESOME experiences. The staff is friendly and accommodating; the grounds are beautiful; the wine is delicious. This is a laid-back winery experience - I recommend the tasting or just getting a bottle and sitting on the patio with a cheese board ! It’s a nice place to spend a few hours hanging out. The last visit my friends and I were helped by Len and Michele. They were knowledgeable about the wine, very friendly faces, and went above and beyond to make our experience special.</Review>

Beautiful spot and great for large  groups. Their customer service is definitely a highlight and I hope they are proud of their people (and pay them handsomely) because they definitely portray the brand well. The cab Franc was phenomenal!< /text>

Today's visit was disappointing. Nobody was interested in helping out, everyone seemed to be driving through the day. Also they no longer had the great Italian meats they used to serve with their awesome cheeses. Wine is still good though. So if ambiance, personality and good food aren't what you are looking for, then this is your place. Oh and great views from their patio.</text>< Pics>

<text>Our latest experience at Viansa left us longing for the days when this winery was owned by the Sebastiani family.
There are no more foods to sample or buy.   the bar on one side was completely closed with no wines in the racks.
It used to be so busy, but this time there was hardly anyone there.
The wines we just OK this time.
We planned to eat lunch there after doing a tasting and buy 2 glasses of wine and sit outside to enjoy the view.
The pours were very small and the hostess seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. They used to be super friendly.
We bought some sandwiches and 2 glasses of wine and my glass was $14.  I asked her why it was so expensive and she said "welcome to Wine Country" like it was my first time in big-boy pants.
We also went to Jacuzzi and Cline that day.  The wines were much better and the service was much better.
This used to be out first stop when we got to wine country, but not any longer.</text><Gmap_id>0x8085a5e352f65d45:0xc0b8363aa93ab188</Gmap_id><time>1440480268026<//time><rate>2< /rate></record></dataset><record>

We visited Viansa yesterday. I love this winery and have brought many friends here through the years. I love the views and tranquility.Yesterday, unfortunately there were so many kids  running around, screaming, you would think it was a day care! As we were walking down the stairs, a group of young girls were running up the stairs, and almost knocked us down. There were dogs there, and we almost stepped in some poo on the lawn...when did this place  become a daycare and allow dogs? I was hard to take the beautiful sight in with a family nearby with a screaming baby and little boys running around screaming. Who brings kids to wine tasting?

We bought some wine glasses and wine and the heavy set guy behind the counter put everything in the bag without any paper to protect the glasses. I asked for a second bag and he was rude....so sad. This place use to have the best people working there.<//text>

I came here with my boyfriend and his mom. We couldn’t have asked for a better expierence. We booked a private villa and it was absolutely perfect. The wine and cheese board was delicious. The servers were attentive and even brought two extra wines for the tasting. I would recommend this winery to anyone who is visiting!< /Text>

This winery has nice views and is very well kept, however the wine leaves much to be desired. I have had better wine for less than $10 in Trader Joes. Also, the service was terrible, a grumpy old man that could barely keep up with the 6 people at the bar. it was embarrassing. This was on a week day, we were taking some international guests to experience the world renowned wineries of Northern california. We decided to stop at this beautiful winery only to realized after spending 80$  for 4 samplers that the wine is terrible. Don’t go here if you like wine, disappointment guaranteed.</review>

This is a great place to kick back and slow your pace while taking in the beauty that is Sonoma.  I recommend buying a bottle and some snacks to enjoy the true splendor of this winery they have yummy food choices and a tasty wine selection you can purchase by the glass or by the bottle it's all good😀<//Review>

The grounds are gorgeous and lots of great photo opportunities. There was a guitar player that was playing very chill yet popular music. The wood fired pizzas were very delicious; I had blue cheese and pancetta pizza. The cabanas were cozy and allowed for a great atmosphere despite some wind. Our host, Lindsey, was incredible. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the wines we enjoyed and the charcuterie board was fantastic. Told my leadership team at work we should plan a social here because it really is that great.</review>

Does not get better than this. We arrived early on a Saturday and had such a good time. Dan served us to a great selection of wines and the history of the Vinyard.  We has a number of bottle shipped home and joined their club.  Nice to get wines that are not sold in our area.< /review>

I was a member at Cosentino Winery, they told us we can go wine tasting for free at Viansa Winery for free because it was their sister winery.  We were charged, which was disappointing, we still bought a bottle of wine. Place is beautiful but is very empty outside, bring it some food and outdoor entertainment.  Felt a little franchise which we didn't like.  Would love to come back and visit again.  Cancelled our membership at Cosentino......</review>

The view at Viansa can't be beat. The wines are great and the tasting fee is reasonable. The food is overpriced but not a deal breaker. Definitely visit this place to have a glass of wine and enjoy the view!</Text>

It was fairly large and a bit busy, and it did seem like they were herding people through off of tour buses.

The 2009 Zin and the 2008 Cab Franc were the best wines and they were worth the drive out here. The staff was friendly if a bit rushed by the crowd.</text>< pictures>

The view and the property were beautiful and the wine was decent. Pours seemed a little light for the cost and although I am sure the glasses were clean, they had pretty bad water spots and it was a little distracting. The person pouring for us looked like she’d rather be somewhere else. She was slow to acknowledge us and not friendly at all so that affected the overall experience.

<Date>1383262637175<//Date><Text>Let's face it, it's challenging to get to all the tasting rooms you might wish before closing time. Why stress in traffic when you can chill out on the well-landscaped terrace at Viansa, one of the first places you come to on Route 121. Even the ironwork on the stairs is lovely. I heard the traffic can be a nightmare if there's racing at Ifineon -- worthwhile to check.<//Text></record>

This place used to be good until the new ownership took over last yr. It still has great views and all but the winter tasting experience has gone down the drain. They also don't allow to taste or most of the time even have the great aleatico wine which is perfect for the sunny Sonoma weather in summer.
I hope they bring back the old ways of treating customers.< /Text>

<Text>Viansa was a great winery under previous management.  It is sad to cancel my membership due to a inferior staff.  Do not recommend Viansa any longer.   They are dissripecfull now; could be due to my ethnicity.  However, my miney is worth the same.   I am taking it to a better business.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8085a5e352f65d45:0xc0b8363aa93ab188<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Two stars just for the views. Got there and hour before it closed and the lady at the bar was not very helpful. We were torn between doing a tasting or just getting a bottle and sitting outside. She said "as long as you're out of here by 5". Didn't really give us any info on any of their wines. Very disappointed.<//Review><Rating>2<//Rating><GmapID>0x8085a5e352f65d45:0xc0b8363aa93ab188<//GmapID><user_name>Debbie L<//user_name><resp>{'time': 1528832700390, 'text': "Hi Debbie,  we're sorry to hear your visit was disappointing!

<Text>They have wood fire pizza and the smell of smoke was in my hair, my clothes and my wine. It was disgusting. The wine was way below average, especially the reds were really bad. Service was ok. The view and the location - it's very easy to get to from 37, were the only redeeming factors but will not visit again.<//Text>< Rate>

Poor experience!! Not the same Viansa I knew 7 years ago! Wines have gone down hill, hardly any product in stock, limited selection, and price for the wine tasting is overpriced!! Sad but don't recommend this winery!!< /text>

After change of ownership, Viansa removed sweet selection of wine, which is very sad. Overall selection shrunk dramatically and overpriced.< /Text>

A first vineyard!
We are finally on the road to the Napa Valley to taste wine. Our expedition begins in force with this magnificent vineyard located on a hill. On this first January, the view is superb, I don't even dare imagine what it will be like in summer. The wines are very good, the service impeccable and the meats and the cheese perfect. A very nice experience.

<text>(Translated by Google) This was the nicest of the four wineries we visited in Sonoma and Napa Valley. Here we could sit and enjoy the view while tasting the wine and we were encouraged to taste the grapes. It cost $ 20 to taste 4 different wines, but the portions in the glasses were generous.

Dette var den koseligste av fire vingårder vi besøkte i Sonoma og Napa Valley. Her kunne vi sitte og nyte utsikten mens vi smakte på vinen og vi ble oppmuntret til å smake på druene. Det kostet 20$ å smake på 4 forskjellige viner, men porsjonene i glassene var generøse.<//text>< Rating>

Ranch Side Cafe in Lake View Terrace. It’s a random looking cafe set on a busy intersection just off of the 210 freeway. It sits just outside of Angeles Crest National forest where you can go to ride horses, hike or shoot clays. Ranch Side cafe serves Mexican, American and Ethiopian food, which is a weird mix but it works. I had their Ranch side melt with is chicken salad with tomatoes, melted cheese and cashews. The cashews was a little weird at first but it grew on me. Make sure to upgrade the side to onion rings. They were great.

Ranch Side Cafe is a great local spot. Check them out.</review>

<text>It was just ok. The food had no flavor!! And I think it could have made it better than they did!! And the price was too high for what you get!! I would not come back to eat there again and if I was you I would not even go in the first place!!!<//text><Rate>1< /Rate>< pics>

Great food, made fresh and the owner is so friendly. I was super excited to try Ethiopian food. They also have Mexican food. We got burritos also and they were delicious and big. I'm definitely going back for breakfast.<//text>

Found this place by chance. Glad I went in. Wasn’t busy for a Sunday morning which I liked. Lots of options for breakfast on the menu, but went with the Ortega Chile and Carne Asada omelette. Huge plate and lots of food. Price was reasonable as well.<//review>

But the food is top notch for a little mom-n-pop restaurant. You can also get Ethiopian food which I would highly suggest if you're feeling adventurous. The service and food are great and the restaurant is clean. I cannot wait to come back to this gem in LVT.<//Text>< Rating>

Found this place by chance. Glad I went in. Wasn’t busy for a Sunday morning which I liked. Lots of options for breakfast on the menu, but went with the Ortega Chile and Carne Asada omelette. Huge plate and lots of food. Price was reasonable as well.</review>

The food has always been fairly good grub! And the owner is a very hospitable human  being. Only reservations I had was plastic open rewashable cups being used to serve beverages. I strongly believe bottled beverages need to be consider in helping to eliminate the spread of the virus. Considering the covid pandemic is not yet over or under control.</Text>

<Review>Personally, I've only been here breafast and lunch. They have great selection of entree for at least those time's of the day.  But the food is top notch for a little mom-n-pop restaurant. You can also get Ethiopian food which I would highly suggest if you're feeling adventurous. The service and food are great and the restaurant is clean. I cannot wait to come back to this gem in LVT.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I arrive at this excellent restaurant from time to time  as I love the  special atmosphere that is part of this place. The crew is extremely attentive and well trained. The service is awfully quick. Also, the food you get is good. I visited more than once and I was always delighted. The pay is modest. I highly recommend this place to to all.<//text>< Pictures>

Breakfast all day! I had California Omelette and asked it to be scrambled. I added Ortega chili’s, bell peppers and onions. My meal came with a side and I had pancakes, they were fluffy and delicious. My wife had 3 soft tacos, 1 chicken & 2 carne asada. The carne asada was little over cooked, though was good. We shared a piece of pumpkin pie!! The server was friendly and attentive! They have Ethiopian items on the menu too</text>

<text>It's a very good place to eat. One of the best places that I have been going to for many years in this area.  I think that it predated that freeway,  but not sure.  Gateway to Little Tejunga if you ride motorcycles or go to the Range. The food is great if you get hungry like me.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>If you never tried Ethiopian cuisine, then, you're missing out on a delciuos and healthy experience. You gotta check this place out. Not only does this hidden gem offer Ethiopian specialties, but, they have American & Mexican options too. The food is always fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. The service is excellent and the atmosphere is relaxing and casual.< /text>< Pictures>

Nice people and OK service, but uninspiring food and just "canteen" coffee. This is what is known as a "greasy spoon", workman's cafeteria. It would take so little effort and investment to make it into a decent, modern Cafe with a choice of quality coffees and some food not cooked in old fat. The fren h toast tasted old lard that had been used to cook grits or eggs... Just sloppy and cheap.<//review>

Nope. Waited for an hour for food even though the place was half empty. A wait is worth it if the food is good, but everything tasted bland. Keep in mind my family and I only had breakfast items, so this criticism is for the breakfast items mostly. I recommend eating elsewhere.< /Text>

They are listed on UberEats, but jack up the prices almost 30% .

What a delicious breakfast and there were fresh flowers on all the tables. The coffee is not the usual 'breakfast place coffee'. It was flavorful and smooth. Service was great and the clientele was varied from old cowboys to younger hip. They have been there for 16 years so they are doing something right. I think I will go back to try the Ethiopian food sometime!< /review>

I always stick to the breakfast but there's a lot of choices here. The coffee is pretty top notch too. Some diners have bad coffee that almost tastes burned but they do a good job of keeping a fresh pot. There's not too much around this area but I'm glad we have this cafe< /review>

Awesome family owned cafe, have been going here for years. The food is authentic and they have plenty of healthy options. Eat inside and enjoy the artwork or on a really nice day you can eat out doors and enjoy the scenery.</text>

Fast and friendly service, but coffee WAS typical American watered-down (although had a good taste), English muffins were the kind you get from grocery store, but the pancakes...those were perfect! Overall, I hope they make their coffee better, and not just because we need to conserve water for the drought;)<//Text>

Meh would be the best description of this place. Stopped here because of the reviews. The servers we're confused and stepping on each other. Three different servers asked us if we wanted more coffee to which we said yes and no one brought out another cup until we pinned one down and ask them to bring it directly out. They were very nice however. The owner on the other hand seem to be a little bit snippy. I wouldn't have rated this place down for any of that, but the food... out of a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 4. The hollandaise for the eggs benedict was pre-made and gritty. The egg white omelet was just strange.  it was turkey wrapped in a lot of spinach, with minimal egg whites. Overall just a strange experience. Also, what I found weird was that the bill was broken down in departments, not food orders. We have 7 "dept 002" on the bill at various prices.</Text>

Great place to eat, if you're in that area I highly recommend it. Friendly servers, friendly staff, friendly decor. The food isn't a gourmet meal but what they do cook is excellent, every time.<//Review>

<user_id>102350308472201400158</user_id><Text>Cane here for an oil change and costed $92.96. Its good if you want them to check everything that you don't have a clue on. They do a full inspection and add synthetic oil. They don't replace air filter and cabin filter you need to pay extra for that or bring your own and they'll do it for free. Kinda crazy that your already paying 100$ dollars and you don't get something like that included. Cashier's were nice but Richy Z. would get a little frustrated with me cause I brought my own oil and filters and that I had alot of questions since it was my first time. Pricey and average customer service.</Text>< rating>

<user>108388999902830023152< /user><rating>1</rating><text>every time I come the price of the oil change goes up 😔 they also no longer work on Lexus due to Lexus up charging since we all got smart and went to Toyota now your forced to go to Lexus. I brought in my car to have the AC fixed when I got it back my stereo was not working. I brought it back and was charged 140$ to be told it doesn't work take it to Lexus....I already knew it didn't work that's why I brought it back. I was told it was a coincidence that it quit working when they worked on my car and Lexus now wants 3300$ yes that is not a typo...three thousand 3 hundred dollars to put in a new stereo and aftermarket is not an option due to the AC running through it.....hm AC running through my stereo Toyota fixed the AC and my stereo quit working....seems easy to figure out Toyota damaged my stereo but won't admit it or help to fix it....I now cannot use it but hey the AC works</text>< user_name>

<review>I used to order from this place all the time. Uber Eats mainly, and my go to order was the bourbon bacon burger with seasoned fries and a strawberry milkshake.

Well, recently I've been ordering breakfast menu items, but this Denny's store, this particular one never ceases to amaze me. Now I'm not saying that they're perfect, but pretty damn close.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I hate to leave a poor review but although modern Denny's are decent and fairly reliable, skip the one on El Cajon Bl. The service is lacking, but worse the food was several notches under par in almost every way. Edible, but not well prepared. Toast was dry and stale, sausage burned on one side not even brown on the other. The eggs were decent. Hash browns boring and slightly undercooked to my taste but acceptable. This was not the Denny's brand breakfast I've come to expect from other Denny's. My daughters sandwich looked awful and not fresh. We had to wait too long to order, despite the waitress coming to our table to inform us that she couldn't take our order, twice.  And the food took a long time to get there despite not being terribly busy. Anybody can have a bad day but Ive been there before and now vow to never go back to that location.  Denny's is great, but skip this one unless your a gambler. They don't have good food and the server we had didn't seem interested in her job. My daughter thought she was rude. Not sure Id go that far. Just apathetic. Databyter< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80d954e4cad01227:0x278caca764810e1c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My cheese burger was the JAM!!!
Had an amazing server believe her name was Marcella not sure I'm inebriated.
But top quality service in a time were customer service sucks.
Great job you guys!!!< /text>

<Review>How unfortunate,  a bad service restaurant in a good area. Food portion was relatively small and the server picked up condiments me and my wife had asked for from another table that was occupied when we arrived and placed them on our table without sanitizing them. Luckily my wife took notice and sanitized them with our Keychain sanitizer. Will not be coming back.< /Review>< Pictures>

Denny's has pretty good diner food. During covid, they have a wait list for seating in/outdoors. Their out door seating is all very close (I'd say closer than when eating inside.) So, if that bothers you make sure you say something to be seated accordingly. They are doing well during covid to keep guests comfortable and happy.< /Text>

I visited this spot in thanksgiving day because it’s the only choice. I had Holiday Turkey Melt in addition to Zesty Nachos. It was as expected. Also, they have brilliant feature which is 24/7 in 365 days and provide a wide range of food such as: Pancakes, Steaks, Omelet etc.<//Text>

This is by far my best experience at a denny's. This denny's was clean and quick. I had the lumberjack breakfast with am extra egg all cooked perfectly and great tasting. I also had ybete green smoothie, which was refreshing.their tres leeches pancakes were sooo good!! It is an awesome idea!Manager was walking around making sure all coffees were filled and greeting guest! And you can't beat these prices plus there coupons in the mail! Which I used saved me $7!</Text>

Great ppl, and quality consistent food. I am not a fan of "fancy" breakfast. And some diners don't know how to cook eggs. So Dennys is a good choice for breakfast that you know and love.< /Text>

This is an older Denny's we had never been to. Plenty of parking and really great service. When we ordered we weren't very hungry and I just sort of mentioned my wife and I would be sharing what we ordered. We received the food with plates of food for my wife and plates of food for me. I thought we had double ordered. The kind woman said she over heard what I said so she brought the order already, perfectly divided, and boy was it delicious 💞.</Text>

<Review>Great food and fast service. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. A good choice for any meal!

A family environment that caters well to both children and seniors.  There is definitely something for everyone.

Once you have made a decision you might regret your decision because there are so many good things to choose from making it difficult to decide.

I would come here again and again knowing that I will not be disappointed as the food is served extremely consistently.

I am looking forward to the next time I come to eat here!< /Review>< UserId.>

<review>The food is good, but I can’t stop thinking about the amount of flies I’ve seen. And the food took forever to come out. And plus while sitting next to the window I realized there were 3 dead flies and 2 about to die.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Our table was on an incline due to the uneven street. Couldn't eat comfortably due to the fact that my chair that was leaning back. Food was solid. Sevice was decent but my group had to wait till we got the check to get any napkins. Not the best experience but then again maybe thats what I get for wearing a LA DODGERS CHAMPIONSHIP Hat in San Diego.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80d954e4cad01227:0x278caca764810e1c</gmapID></record>

Good basic all American food. Service was great here even when I ordered from postmates and my order was messed up the server on duty went above and beyond in making sure it got corrected and even gave me some extra goodies for the inconvienance and I left happy with how the mistake was made right and handled. Plus my food was delicious.<//review>

The service is too slow. The hash browns are too raw. Hash browns are supposed to be crunchy not just crunchy on top and raw through out the rest of it! Eeww! They can't get your order right to save their lives. I ordered a burger once and they brought me a veggie burger. I found out the hard way by bitting into it. Gross! Then they still couldn't get it right. They forgot the cheese then they forgot my tomato. My goodness. By the time they got it together my friend was already done eating. You know how hard it is to watch someone eat while you wait for them to get your order right and your hungry. I only go now because that's where my friend likes to go but if I had my choice I'd choose somewhere else entirely. If you can, don't go to Denny's. They really stink.<//text>

The food was warm. While everyone else's food comes with Steam coming off the Meal. The Crepe was like leather. It was wet with syrup and I, still couldn't cut it with a fork without etching the plate. Not enough Syrup options. Food presentation was 👎. Looks like the Cook was in a rush.  ☕ costs $2.69 a cup. But I only received barely half of a cup of  ☕.  $23.89 for 2 people. The Men's bathroom 🚻 was wet, ice cold and had water dripping from lights in the ceiling. If you sit on the 🚽 you better have a jacket on. And something to keep your butt cheeks from getting frostbite.<//review>

Unfortunately our Denny's in Encinitas closed and we miss it. We were in North Park and decided to go to this Denny's. Elizabeth our waitress did not dissapoint. She was friendly, courteous and very attentive. We enjoyed our steak and eggs very much. Awesome meal and kudos to Elizabeth. Thank you!</text>

<Review>Not my favorite Denny's! Food & price always spot on, but mgr needs to watch his front door, for people sneaking into bathrooms. Disgusting! No longer feel safe here!  Sorry</Review>< Pictures>

Then, come to find out I put myself through some ridiculous struggle over nothing since this establishment apparently never accepted EBT, and after the fact that all I did was let whoever was working right then and there know about the false advertising about them online, they felt like they needed to waste my hard earned cash just a little more by selling me pancakes burnt to a crisp that also tasted as if it were cooked in a pan that hadn't been cleaned from the night before. Simply, I am just seriously unimpressed.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Very small location, but frankly that adds to the charm of an old world diner. Staff were friendly and service was fast and efficient. For a Denny's you can't go wrong at this location.< /review>< pictures>

<text>No hi welcome to Denny’s like other customers received. I stood at front the two workers didn’t say anything. They looked at me but didn’t even say hi LOL WOW. Than one finally says you can have a seat there and I said no I rather sit on that side she said that’s fine. I asked for water they bring me the water with a fly in it. I immediately saw it, so if I can see idk why they couldn’t before bringing it to me. I was staring at the water the fly was at the top as soon as she set it down she noticed that I was staring at it but couldn’t figure out why I’m saying to myself you don’t see it?? but I said thank you anyway. But I’m like just gross. There were also two flys flying around our table and my daughter who just turned 4 that’s why we were there it’s her birthday said mommy behind you loud kept talking about the flys. I eventually asked for another water I said there’s a fly in it. You know cuz it’s always awkward for the worker to hear that so I made it seem like it just landed in it since we had flys already flying around us which she doesn’t know that probably but no it really actually came from wherever they fill the drinks. So that’s disgusting that they have flys everywhere and I’m afraid for my food. Who knows what they have in the back. So that place had a lot of flys. Than the food came, didn’t even separate mine from my daughters. She asked after if you want a separate plate it’s like no duh ! But I said I’ll just use the saucer you put the ranch in. So she doesn’t have to do extra work. I was really a decent customer who didn’t complain about ANYTHING when I had a right too. I understand being a server is hard. However I’m a customer a PAYING customer and I deserve decent service and food quality in return. So the last hope of this birthday meal for my daughter was the food. They didn’t have any drinks I asked for, Shirley temple they are out. Mango or strawberry banana smoothie they are out for my daughter I’m like well what do you have my Jesus. Come to find out they had the smoothie I’m like oh wow the unsure run around. My daughter wanted strawberry banana one. It was overly sweet. So the food finally came was disappointed as well. It was so disgusting. Even the ranch tasted thin and like salad dressing not dipping ranch. WHICH I had many times at Denny’s including this location and it was always thick and creamy and consistent. Also the sausage links say ON THE MENU 4 my daughters plate only had 2. I was laughing inside at that point. This was such a disaster. I don’t know what happened with Denny’s or if it’s just this location but it wasn’t the same. The experience was bad, the environment was bad with the flys flying around us and actually being in my water that they brought me THAT THEY DIDNT EVEN SEE that’s so embarrassing I would be embarrassed as a worker, and the food was bad. I still paid for the meals and gave a tip. I’m not gonna make the working man or woman have a hard time I understand they’re stressed but at the same time I should be respected. And the fact they didn’t even say hi welcome to Denny’s from the start and the whole experience ended up being gross. A little goes a long way. It just wasn’t there. Like I said, I’m not gonna be a “ “Karen” customer I will still tip, I just won’t be back. I may try other Denny’s in future but not that one. The decor is outdated just stale the flys and the customer service like they don’t want to be there and the food idk if it’s simply just the chef who don’t know flavor and how to cook or the corporation changing everything and getting rid of certain drinks. Either way that experience was so gross and bothersome. Just simply won’t be back to this particular location. I love Denny’s as it is a classic restaurant been going to since I was a kid. But this particular location no thanx. Maybe years from now with new management, servers, chefs and staff but not any time soon.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Stopped in here after taking my wife to the airport for a pre-rush breakfast. Been to a lot of Denny's, even one with a bar in Bakersfield. This spot has got that clean, classic diner feel that you only see in movies. Quick service, not stingy on the coffee refills. Got the lumberjack slam that morning. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was sourdough toast was chewy-er than I expected.</text>

Don’t waste your time here. Bad customer service. First time in San Diego and they told us we had to wait outside. When we went outside they told us we couldn’t sit down. They took forever to bring us our food and then forgot to give us napkins and straws.< /text>

Quiet and relaxing. I ate the fish n chips.  They have the best French Fries here but sometimes they under cook them.  The new Fish product is a great addition to the menu but when it is allowed to thaw out it cooks up dark dark almost black in color product and tastes burnt. When the product is cooked from a frozen state it comes out golden brown and the taste is perfect. The service is hit and miss depends on the time of day. Overall it's a decent place to eat.<//text>

I wont complain about the wait time because it's not the employee's fault.  Food was good. Glad we were able to switch out the rotten grapes for bananas without an issue. Smaller diner compared to others. Very humble waiter Susan I believe.</Text>

<review>We just got our order from uber eats. The pancakes are always great, but unfortunately the service from the dennys worker was not very helpful over the phone. Dennys didn't have a section to select sides for dinners. I followed the directions and called the establishment. The lady who took the call pretty much brushed me off when I asked if I could have mashed potatoes and asked for a veggie side. She said she was too busy and I need to fix it on the app. I told her uber said to call the merchant.  She hung up on me and I wasn't able to get any resolve. I ended up getting a whole mess of just dry mashed potatoes with a chicken fried steak plopped on it. I highly suggest Dennys management look into that, please. I also sent review to UberEats and sent an email to corporate. Thanks.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Food was ready pretty fast & my burger was really good... only thing negative is the fries were so over cooked I could barely eat most of them. Our waiter was extremely nice & very good, always kept our drinks topped off. Good place to eat.</review>

Service was really great... Attentive, quick, and answered all our questions, she made good recommendations. Food was OK, but can't complain for the price. It's a good value. Did not have to deal with drunks or homeless people like in the past. A good alternative to the diner down the street.< /review>

Dennis could really be a hit-or-miss depending on which location really depends on the service you'll get crappy service not that they're too busy or the food isn't up to par. I found some locations with insufficient staff where there be just simply with numbers hope the food handlers for the mental capacity of their employees. But this location on El Cajon Boulevard just so happens to be one of the good ones friendly service and I like to judge a breakfast house on their pancakes and Denny's pancakes are always fluffy and very good. Lunch fast easy and cheap can never go wrong with a burger dinner to enjoy.< /Text>

The chicken is tender and veggies are fresh. Toped with cheese's and sour cream it makes for a delightful meal!  With friendly staff and quality Cook's it is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy alone, with friends or family. Yummy!<//Text>< user>

The French Toast Slugger also comes with 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon, full size juice AND coffee for $8.99. Our waitress, Maria was so patient, gave excellent customer service. Food was delicious.</review>

I give Denny's a 5 star especially at this location because I felt some LUV from my server and it was from the ❤ heart...just a real lady doing her job and making me feel like family.  That's worth 5 stars and more to me,   Thanks Denny's....this is being 100....u feel me?   The world needs more people like this for our next generation to know and understand that its takes more than a slogan it relay that feeling it takes courage to care openly💜   That is the best way I can explain it. HAVE A GREAT DAY...   :)< /review>

Just had the Chicken Loaded Potato Skillet from the value menu and it is a very satisfying meal. It has a good combination of ingredients served on a sizzling Skillet. The chicken is tender and veggies are fresh. Toped with cheese's and sour cream it makes for a delightful meal!  With friendly staff and quality Cook's it is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy alone, with friends or family. Yummy!</review>

EVERYTHING feels RUSHED there. We only went there ONCE and that was enough for me/us. I dont care if we are on EL CAJON BLVD. or on La Jolla Drive. The service should always be the same BUT you only can accomplish that when YOU have a LEADER ,POINTING the way and not a MANAGER. BIG DIFFERENCE.< /Review>

Food was to typical Denny’s standard, server was great but the rest of the staff seemed to be uncomfortable that my family and I were there. We were a party of 8, but we were completely polite and didn’t ask for anything out of the ordinary. Alexis Estrada was extremely rude to our party and asked us to move from 3 tables to 2 tables because he needed the table.<//Text>

<text>Food is great service is friendly no complain whatsoever 👍

04-14-2021    5 years ago, they had great service. But unfortunately today there was no “soup of the day “ , no Buffalo wings, no tarter sauce for my fish fillet, no coke ( as in it was mostly clear, and it tasted like the filters needed to be changed ASAP ) staff made light of the situation. Sadly I am forced to give it a star because it’s the lowest I can give, but they also deserve a thumbs down 👎<//text>< Pictures>

Not my favorite, seems that service is getting worse every time I go in. Yes I request my bacon crispy (it never is, more like almost raw) ALWAYS have to send it back. I get the confused look... seriously does any restaurant advertise limp, raw bacon? I'll get eggs but no toast, toast arrived eggs are cold. I'm done!</text>

<Review>Dennys has been a staple in my life for a long time. Whether it was in highschool as a goth kid and I needed to get outve the house and relax with a meal or a coffee. Or a reasonably priced dinner with my daughter and fiance. There is always a new promotion going on and food to price ratio is usually very good on the wallet. Plus being open 24/7 for someone with restless leg syndrome and sleep issues is a blessing in disguise.<//Review><time>1563344676281</time><GmapID>0x80d954e4cad01227:0x278caca764810e1c< /GmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

But c’mon they’ve got breakfast, dinner, dessert, whatever you could possibly be craving. Want fries with your pancakes? Why not. Take it from me, overdosing on chocolate milk never hurt anybody.</Review>< pictures>

It's only hard to get a seat on Sundays, besides that there's usually a seat or table open, or the wait is minimal, like 5 minutes.. They refill drinks regularly, they even let me take some coffee to go. The food is what you paid for in terms of taste and quality. They service is usually pretty good too.< /Review>

Marie Belle Rodriguez had horrible customer service skills. She hung up on me. She told me to call back. She told me to ask for the manager, which oh by the way, she is the manager. I want more then my money back. I want my time back which is what she waisted. The worst part about it is that she (and the employees) answered the phone in Spanish. I continued to asking about it my order and there was no  communication because your employee did not know any English. I am no racist or fascist by any means. But if I can not understand or communicate with the people in my own country to order food, this is a problem. Yes, this is me making a point while I file a formal report to your corporate office.< /Text>

A great Denny' s located right on El Cajon Blvd, it is frequently busy, but service is excellent. Not the largest location, but I've never have to wait too long. Food quality has always been great, and prices are fair, as usual for this chain.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>One of my many home Dennys I go to.  When it comes to a cheap Breakfast platter, this is the place I go to.  The waitresses are nice, they're bilingual, and they aim to please.  One flaw, they sometimes memorize which can be to their downfall.  If you have a complicated order and they're not taking it down, check on your order because  it may not have mentally been implicated.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Not sure what's up with the Denny's restaurants but they have been seriously dropping the ball lately from old stale food to to racially questionable service. I don't feel comfortable eating at Denny's anymore seems to be having some kind of negative vibrations. This wasn't just one bad experience it's been multiple negative experiences.</Review>

It is the BEST Denny's that I have ever eaten at. The staff is OUTSTANDING. They are like family! I have been a regular here and LOVE the pancakes. The MANAGERS JOSE, MARIBEL & ALAN are so ACCOMODATING so I am guaranteed a excellent experience every time I dine there. They have a new waitress, Male, from the South, OMG!, like icing on a cake, he is such a compliment to the team/family. This location is my #1 choice whenever I dine out. The Banana Split is excellent for romancing! Yes, Yes, this Denny's is the BEST!< /text>

Lucky i even gave it a star wouldnt even consider it after my expirience at this establishment .1st i came in at 4am hungry tired and just going through alot , justbwanted to enjoy a place to sit a warm plate of pancakes , rather then that i got to enjoy looking at the menu for strong half hour to witch i was asked if id like to start with something to drink and my server would bring it shortly ... Well 45 min later after blaintently ignoring me serbing an entire table that arrived after me , repeatedly ignored my gestures eye contact and of course polite attempts at asking to take my order .. Still no water or even a hello .. Finally i called the front desk.. On my phone ..witch was 3 seats in feont of me where my waitress answered politely and ready to help, and i say i was wandering if i could order for pick up of short stack of pancakes she said yes of course who is this for ? I said oh just the guy sitting in the back that youve been ignoring for rhe past 45 minutes.. She immediately went back to looking around like i dont exist dumb look on her face .. I am sorry but i just lost it there and stormed off ... With out ne water whatsoever .. I have never felt so utterly disrespected by a food service worker ..doesnt matter what any of her issue is i did nothing wrong to her to be treated that way .. The fact i had to call a server 20 ft away on his cell phone to ask for his order because the server doesnt think its her job to not ... Do her job?? Worst resturant ever seriously lady nothing personal but i hope you find yourself in a similar situation some day when its already been alot of things
This is episode 1 of three please see dennys store on midway for part 2 ..</Text>

<review>The manager "E", for not saying his entire name, spent time talking to a woman as I entered the place. He didn't acknowledge my waiting as they continue talking. They both realized that I was standing - waiting to be seated - and he was the one with the task of greeting and seating people. I got tired of waiting and left the place... Not even a welcome to Denny's. I called the place to notify the real manager, but "E" answered the phone saying that he was the manager. I said that for a manager he did a crappy job, and was rude to me...along with the lady who also knew I was waiting and continued talking with him. Then he rectified and said he was the "manager at the time".
I left him know that both should learn how to treat people and be polite. I'll never go there again. I went the day before this incident, which was Mother's Day, but it was crowded, then I tried today with much less people and got this? Never again!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dennys is Dennys.  You can order anything  just by pointing at the the menu and prices are okay.  They no longer carry onion rings but you can still get French frys and gravy. Waitressesvand waiters are polite and prompt. Worth 30% for tip.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

They scratched our name off the list and never called our name. Realized they skipped over us when two other parties of same size was sat before us. When brought to their attention they did seat us right away. Food seemed much improved uopn than a few years ago.<//Text>

I got a coffee to go and the staff was nice.

It is Denny’s so, I expect nothing more than three stars from this typical restaurant.<//text>

<text>How can anyone go to an establishment to eat and your waitress cant understand  english. Most of our order was pointing fingers at the pictures. The only thing we could order was the choices that had a picture. How could I experience this at a dennys. The only good thing was the food. Delicious. She never returned for refills.</text></record>

This Denny's gets two stars. All star credit goes to the graveyard shift Latina Women.
The negative three stars belong in their entirety too the graveyard cook, and punk managerial type beta Male,
That pretends  to to be there...
Ridiculous.  Notice dic is up in the middle of ridiculous?< /Review>

<text>The service was adequate for the late night drunk crowd. The people I was with didn't believe in tipping but I tipped anyways. The food was cooked to perfection. But everyone else in my party complained about every small thing.<//text>< UserId.>

Service was downright terrible. Waitress seated us in the back corner and goes "sorry I'm putting you in the back!" We were ok with it since we liked how quiet it was then after we get our drinks and condiments (which one of our party touched with his finger) she comes back to say "hey so this spot fits a group of 9 could you move to the booth over there?" And the group she promised our spot to, the seats we were currently sitting in, was standing at the entrance watching us, so do we have a choice? We discreetly and reluctantly move and staff doesn't help us move our things basically move what you can hold and leave the rest. What pisses me off is that we actually waited for our table and they walk in and basically get vip service. Sorry is the money my group worked for invalid compared to this group of 9 who just so happened need our specific booth when there was literally a row of empty tables along the wall parallel to us. So the manager Fran decides to be the one to ask about billing and pissed off as I am I ask her "do we seriously need to pay this entire $42.58 meal after your staff literally moved us as we were about to enjoy our meal? Because that was extremely inhospitable and embarrassing having to move our dishes and personal things and lug it literally across the room in front of other people scowling at us" and she has the audacity to cut me off and raise her voice saying "WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU LET ME EXPLAIN THIS HAS 16 TABLES." So I cut her off right back tried repeating myself and she said no you're paying and walked away. She understood me clearly, I have a stutter but not to where I can't form a coherent sentence. So now knowing were all displeased the entire staff shuns us until we have to sign the bill they send ANOTHER person and he is short with words basically meaning "sign and leave quickly"  he didn't want to have to deal with an angry group but his unprofessional manager forced him to since she didn't want confrontation. I wouldn't have been as pissed if I was still told wed get no compensation if she had a valid reason as to why or if she didn't yell at us but being that she did here I am putting her on blast. Thanks Fran wasting my hard earned money oh and I hope your party of 9 knew that the ranch we had to leave at our old had fingers in it because I totally saw them using our dishes they didn't switch out</Review>

They took over an hour to bring us our food, when there was only one other customer in the restaurant. And there was a hair in our food and overall very bad experience.<//Review>< Name>

I usually love dennys , put in an order to go , classic burger, suppose to $6.99, I paid extra for seasoned fries , also an order of pancake puppies.and a pot roast dinner. Picked the food, I asked why the total was so much, they charged me $ 9.59 for a build your own burger, the cashier's said he changed the price , I used a coupon. I got home looked at the food the fries were over cooked , unedible .I looked  at the receipt the price had not been changed, I call them , all the manager kept saying was sorry<//Text>

The burger could have been done better, but I digress. The problem was when the manager was supposed to correct a mistake and take $3 off, he only took about a dollar off and I didn't notice until I got home.<//text>

They sat us close to the bathrooms and u can feel a bad smell coming from their. Its 8:40am they shouldnt have that smell. I even told my husband they needed to use bleach to clean the bathroom so it can kill the smell. Another thing the menu i received had a hair eww 😷 and they where some flies too, bad bad. They where trying to land on our food some even stop by on the syrup good thing we didn't eat pancakes. Anyways service was good food was okay.  Wont go again!</Review>< gmapID>

Dirty place, dead flies in the bottom of the widows. Very narrow dinning room. Banged up cushions in the booths. Probably the worst Denny’s I have been to. The only positive highlight is friendly stuff.</Review>

Won't be going to that place any more .what wrong ? A lot . To star our order was wrong .then they take it back to fix it and took forever .when we got our order back bacon was cool .they took bacon back and we ask to talk to the manager .he stud up in front of our table and said  yes (on a very passive aggressive way) we finish breakfast and 15 min later pancakes finally  arrive .the manager give us the money back from 1 breakfast  only to find out  we got xtracharge for caramel and vanilla  cream that the pancakes suppost to come with (dulce de leche pancakes)</Review>

Decent Denny's to go to for Sunday brunch or heck any other day. Most Sundays it's packed and the time I went was no different. The wait staff looked overworked and understaffed so I'm gonna cut them a break. The food was just like any other Denny's though so not much to rave about.</text>

I gotta tell ya this little Dennys on El Cajon Blvd. is one of the better Dennys, I've been here between 5&7 pm for a quick dinner several times and the cooks here are really good & "Perfectly Cooked " meals every time. I had a waitress named Karina really "Nice & Attentive" worthy of a big tip too. My wife had a "Senior Turkey Dinner Plate". She let me have a taste and I wanted to cry, cuz it reminded me of Grammas Turkey Dinner from the early 80's. My Moon over Mihami was over the Moon too Karina exchanged the hash browns for fries then pancakes for dessert OMG. We had to be wheelchaired out to our car we were so full.

I ordered a bourbon bacon burger with no veggies or mushrooms and I had to send it back three times because they kept putting veggies on it , by the time I got to start eating my guest had already finished their meal and was watching YouTube then the manager decided that taking only $5 off was sufficient and to add salt to the wound even acted like that was a problem, this dennys is not a good restaurant and I would not recommend it . Also the servers attitude was horrible every time she brought the burger out and I said "asked for no vegetables "
And she would argue with me this was by far my worst experience with dennys .</review>

The food was alright, but the waiter didn't seem friendly nor welcome, Alexis who was the waiter didnt seem he wanted to be there and to lean or not stand properly while taking an order its not professionaly not even good eye contact nor a smile.. The waiter only came to our table twice to refill a cup of coffee and to pick up the plates! After picking up most of the plates asked if we needed anything else it felt as if we were being rushed, didn't offer more napkins, nor a refill on a cold beverage until I was leaving. If your going to have some sort of attitude or not be greeting properly I advise you to find something better that will make you smile.</text>

Horrible!!! A family with a disabled child in a wheelchair comes in and you give the only table wheelchair accessible to another family and then tell them they need to either wait or go somewhere else!!! Absolutely BULL!!!!<//Text>

<Review>The people who work here are always nice and attentive. They have to deal with a variety of patrons who are at times not very respectful. I guess every restaurant that open 24/7 and corporate have to deal with the homeless population. It is not fair to the servers who work hard to provide for themselves/family.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Seriously, slow service, waiter spilled coffee on my leg, no apologies. Mediocre food, no offer to comp meal for the inconvenience of wearing my coffee. Was never really a fan of Denny's anyway, certainly not now.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80d954e4cad01227:0x278caca764810e1c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Not all Denny's are created equal......plus this one server/waiter really needs to learn what the DO/DON'T have as far as food, etc.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Typical American place where you eat well and cheaply. Also 24h and very friendly. Almost everyone speaks Spanish. We asked for 3 things to share between 2 people and it was enough. Half nachos, quesadillas and a chicken platter with broccoli and cheese sauce. With refillable drinks about 32 dollars.
Nachos very rich, regular quesadillas and healthy and rich chicken.

Nachos muy ricos, quesadillas regular y el pollo sano y rico.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_LYY4_hOVolFlMFOw7_XllUNv7kDlgr22l7U8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhURDvwNmHmdLwTTAx-Byh0uGEBWu4qb1bOcqY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXeSuUAA52rZkFBFVxaP0MP2Xb9ikO5P3ujgTb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) Good casual restaurant, open 24 hours, fast food service. They serve from brunch, lunch and dinner. Good for conventional sandwiches and fattening portions. Typical American food restaurant. It is worth eating from time to time a lot of calories per square meter.

(Original)
Bom restaurante casual, aberto 24 horas, serviço de fast food. Servem desde o brunch, lunch e o jantar. Bom para os sanduíches convencionais e porções que engordam. Típico restaurante de comida americana. Vale a pena comer de vez em quando m muita caloria por metro quadrado.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Dennys restaurant, everyone knows it, is the classic American restaurant with good service and uniformity in food and procedures; Or what is the same, there is good service - although not perfect - and good seasoning in the meals. Suddenly a waitress over there does not capture a request well, but that's all.

(Translated by Google) I went to have dinner with my family, I asked for an omelet and the omelet was not good, it was rough, badly arranged, it was not good that night.
Apart from that, the cook came out to tell lamesera that, like Melo, it would not matter the same as in the photo of the menu I mark marqiez
I think that cook has been working for a long time and serves things like lega sugana grasias. And there were also some winged clients that seemed to be pigs repeating some pure nonsense
Greasy
