Good handwash, but they charge more than their listed price. Even though the price is clearly written on a sign, he charges you extra and more than their listed price. The owner would not be happy about this manager.< /Text>

<Time>1550608616641< /Time><rating>4<//rating><review>Fast, easy, hand car wash. $15 basic wash. Cash only! If you want a quick wash and vacuum between rain or to have a shiny car for the weekend this is a great place. You get what you pay. There is an ATM inside the gas station which charges a $3 fee. You pay from your car, get out for the vacuuming, get back in your car for the wash, then pull forward and exit for the had dry. They have bench areas to sit and wait and people are friendly.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEDev3VYLMPYcS-kfaXrpN_vTwzaKMRtPXesx6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

My car always looks great after coming here. Sometimes they might miss a little spot inside, like in the door well, but usually it is spotless. Very happy with this business.< /Text>

< Review>
Love this car wash, only place I take my car. It's a family owned business and the owner along with his family are very kind and hard working. They wash the outside, vacuum and clean the inside of my car for only $14! Cheapest and fastest place I've been to in Concord.<//Review>

< review>
Stopped by because of all the positive reviews but my experience was the complete opposite.  I took my car in and decided to the get the top treatment ($25).  I highlighted some mud stains and bird poop on that car and I asked them to focus on cleaning those areas.  When the car came out of the "car wash" section - those areas had not been cleaned well and the stains were still visible.  I asked again for them to clean those areas and they said they would take care of it in the "drying" section.  I went other there and reminded them that those areas needed to be cleaned and the guy asked me to stand away from the car and wait for him to call me over.  When he told me the car was done - I again pointed out the stains and he told me that the mud and bird poop could not we washed off.  I gave him an incredulous look and he just said - they can't be cleaned, handed me my keys, called me annoying (in Spanish) to his co-worker, and told me to drive off.  A really bad experience and terrible job.  I will not be going back.< /review>

Wanted to find a place that hand washes, but didn't want to pay for a full detail. Found some good reviews and decided to come here. Guess they took an automated wash structure and turned it into a hand wash facility. It's a little hard to see from the street, but it's located on the grounds of the 76 gas station. One guy washes your car and the rest are ready to vacuum and dry off your car. Doesn't seem to be any posted prices, so that might be an issue, but ended up being $13 for a compact sedan. Definitely the best deal in the area.

Took my SUV there a week later and it was $15 for the same level of service. My only wish is that they would wipe down the seats too.</Text>

<text>this place is kinda ripoff....they charged me first time for 20 because my car was super dirty. I paid... I went back, they told me 25$ this time - my car was much cleaner than the first time. I think they just charge you base on how they feel not really have a scale of price. RIPOFF</text>< pictures>

<Review>All washing is done by hand and their wash area can accommodate just about any sized vehicle. They have a large crew for such a small space. If you are the only one there, they all swarm your vehicle and do a bang up job. They do NOT shampoo carpets. Pricing is based on the size of your vehicle. Be prepared to dicker as they do play fast and loose with the posted pricing (all prices are couched with "and up") - and they do not hesitate to try and gig you on the upside.<//Review>< Pictures>

Dont understand why there some people posting so low rating(probably their cars are way dirty and needed a high end cleaning :P). I personally had been to this place and they do the job pretty well. They give hand wash with vaccum for 14 bucks. Though they didnt ask for tip, I wanted to tip them. But the guy asked to do it next time. They are courteous and respectful.< /text>

< Review>
ZERO! This needs a ZERO option! Went here after jerk landscapers at my job blasted grass and bush trimming crud all over my car. Posted price is $13 for a car to do the exterior. Guy comes out and tells me $15 for me because I have mosquitos on my car and they have to spray. What? It's freaking car wash! After pointing out there was still pollen on my window after the hand wash and dry, I pay him his $15 and because I'm a generous person, tip on top of that. Why do I still have mosquitos on the front of my car and sap everywhere? DON'T BOTHER GOING HERE, you have to wash it all over yourself anyway. They've just ruined future tips from me to all.</Review>

<Review>I spend 6 mos out of the year in the North Woods of WI and MN. There are lots of things in the woods that don’t care to negotiate much and consequently firearms are a fact of life.  To meet that need, and carrying a CA drivers license prohibits me from buying firearms in those states.  As a result, I was in need of a local distributor who was knowledgeable about what he was selling.  I found them at this store.  Yeah there are lines; that should tell you something but he people selling the weapons didn’t make the rules. Just deal with it and you will be rewarded with knowledgeable, patient, and professional service.  Seems like a great staff and I congratulate the owner for figuring out the strategy for being able to sustain a business during this trying time. I admit that up north the gun and tackle shops are like coffee shops here, so my expectations are pretty high. This store does a great job meeting my expectations.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1612380590865, 'text': "We're proud to know our services met your expectations and that our professionalism and expertise was easily reflected during your time with us.

Becoming increasingly difficult to do business as FFL in Bay Area, especially extreme left radical like Santa Clara County.  The crazy Covid-19 protocol means they only let one customer inside at a time.  However, this shop needs to be more innovative, quite funny they are in middle of silicon valley and they don't even have a simple messaging based waiting list.  So customers end up waiting long lines outside and getting frustrated.  They need to get their act together, setup a simple online waiting list and ask customers to wait in their cars.  Oh well, things are starting to open up normal, but things don't look bright for FFL's.<//review>

Wanted to give it a couple visits to be fair, before dropping a review.  My recommendation would be to go elsewhere.  They're completely out of basic ammo even 9mm. The firearms they sell will be up-sold at 3 times above the price you could procure via FFL instead.  And the waiting lines take forever. About 1 new customer allowed in every half hour so if you see 4 people waiting outside, forget about it. Basically, I can't think of a good reason to go unless one is just desperate.  Try elsewhere.</text>

My favorite local shop. Most of the staff has been there a while,  and they're always happy to help unlike some other shops in the area who try to pull off some Operator vibe all the time.

There's a small consignment selection of pistols and usually a good variety of long guns and shotguns.  I've seen everything from vintage .22s to  M14s in their used rifles.

There is also a huge selection of gear for the home gun smithing crowd, a good selection of knives and a wide variety of pepper spray for your non-lethal self defense.

One of the best things here- there's always a gung ho movie playing on the TV in the store.</Text>

Well worth the wait -- I went to buy ammo and ended up buying another gun as well!  Lots of inventory packed into a compact space. Very knowledgeable staff, patient, competent, much better than the big box store where I bought my gun.  A great place to buy firearms or accessories -- ask for Tony.< /Review>

< Review>
Staff is very friendly and helpful,  however the waiting time in line is crazy.  Would be nice if they dedicated a time window or separate line for pickup only. I purchased a firearm and came back after the waiting period.  I was disappointed to find out I would have to wait in line for 4 hours or more just to pick up merchandise I had already purchased (and waited about an hour then also).
Bay Area Gun Vault.. If you are reading this, please come up with a system to get pickups through faster! After all, the item was already purchased! We should not have to wait that long for an item already purchased!</Review>

Even though I didn't buy my firearm at #GunVault, only because the one I wanted was for law enforcement only, they set me up immediately with my gun safety certificate/card. Aside from the Covid lines, which they are required to comply with, I highly recommend this business!<//text>< user_name>

<Review>Definitely one of the better gun stores in the Bay area. the reason I like this place so much is because the staff is always friendly and helpful as opposed to other gun stores where they seem to have a chip on their shoulder. I bought guns in the past here and I will continue to buy guns in the future here.</Review>< username>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>The store is amazing but sitting there for over an hour while watching an employee show a lady how to hold a shotgun that had no business buying one is not very efficient or makes me feel safe. Everyone has the right to purchase any firearm they wish but do your research first before entering a gun shop and if the employe has to cover point A to Z for you then he/she should be selling that item as it is not a toy. Employees need to a better job of managing the rush and understanding their customer as just to sell a gun to make a sale is not responsible.<//Review>< pics>

People know what they are doing here. During pandemic, while other places get no stock at all, this place still have 9mm pistol available. Impressive. The only thing you want to keep an eye on is, the prices are questionable. They are very expensive even considering the pandemic. If you are not in a hurry, I would suggest do some research and shop online, it's not that hard. And you can see glock, M9, mossberg available every week here and there. You can get info on Calguns, reddit and other places.

If you are really desperate and need a gun right now, well, this place gets the job done. But the price is like..they are not expecting you to come back and shop again.<//Text>

What a refreshing experience.  People who know what they are talking about, interested in making sure that the best match and "fit" is made between the gun and the person.  Maybe some other retail outlets and stores could take a lesson from the Gun Vault!  Good job.</Text>

First time customer at this store. Walked in looking to purchase a new firearm and was helped as promptly as they could, there were a few people in line before me but I was acknowledged when I walked in and the wait wasn't very long. Plus, it gave me time to check out the plethora of things they offer. They have quite a few new/used firearms in stock and prices on them are reasonable, lots of ammo in stock at decent prices too. Justin C. helped me with my purchase, he was very knowledgeable and straightforward. He was more than happy to answer all my questions to the best of his ability and show me around the firearm I was purchasing. Kenneth T. assisted me with pickup of my firearm and was also happy to help with the other things I was there to purchase. Overall a good atmosphere with friendly service and a knowledgeable staff. I'll definitely be coming back!</Text>

Outstanding group of guys at the Bay Area Gun Vault.
Huge selection of firearms both new and used. Upper end optics selection is quite nice and massive amount of all other accessories.
From lights to cleaning supplies and even reloading supplies I was blown away by their volume of firearm related bits and pieces.
Friendly guys who offer a Private Party Transfer haven for those wanting to lawfully transfer firearms to private individuals.
I have done two PTTs and even bought a excellent valued Glock handgun on my last visit.
Bay Area Gun Vault continues to impress.<//review>

I waited for 12 minutes and an employee walked behind the counter, looked at a pad of paper and asked about someone that knew to sign in, but was already gone. I guess you were supposed to know to sign in.  There are stores that just know how to treat customers right, even when it's busy - these guys don't.  Gun sales are strong so who cares about the customer.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great experience - thank you Erin!
I came in today to pick up my (first) rifle.
Forgot to sign in, but once that was done, I was helped shortly after.
Erin took care of the final paperwork and asked if I had any questions ...
I wanted to demo the functions again, just to make sure. He was kind and patient and went through all the basics and included some useful tips.
His feedback was friendly, honest and educated.
I left the store excited about my first purchase, but also feeling appreciated.
I know everyone expects great service when shopping, but I don't always receive it being a woman in this type of environment.
Thank you again for your kindness and expertise, making my first purchase amazing!
Sincerely,

<Review>First time going today. Pretty good selection. I did a PPT and was helped right away. Staff was very helpful and as I was waiting for buyer to fill out his paper work I got shown a few guns. And I really like how they had used guns for anyone to brows while you wait. I ended up buying a really nice Springfield for a really good price. These guys went out of their way to even send me a picture of the rifle so I didn’t have to drive all the way down their to take a picture myself. Again great place. I will be going back soon!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Bay Area Gun Vault is honestly one of the best gun stores I've been to, and I've been to more than a few over the years. Their selection is very diverse and their prices are certainly reasonable.

The best part by far about this store is the service. They have an awesome group of guys and girls working at the counters and they are willing to spend the time to help and explain something to you. I'll be a pretty loyal customer from here on.</Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Resp>

Impressive shop. They actually do Private Party Transfers. Very professional. I was amazed at the young man who helped us and the level of service he provided. I have owned a gun shop and I am a gunsmith. They go well beyond to insure you understand exactly what information you are providing and to minimize errors. All that service to only make $10. Incredible depth of firearm related items. Massive variety of firearms available and sensible wide selection of accessories. They earned this review. I would use this shop again without hesitation.

<review>I came in for help with a low a profile gas block on an AR. All my questions were answered and the staff made helpful suggestions, I ended up purchasing the free floated handguard as well. This looked like a busy day with many people already being helped however work began on my rifle right away, 15 minutes later the work was done and I walked out with a better gun than I walked in with. I will definitely return for my next firearm purchase.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Very helpful and friendly staff. Extremely important for gun stores these days - if an employee doesn't know something about a product, they will say "I don't know, but let me find out for you" instead of making up an answer on the spot.

After shopping at many gun stores in the Bay Area, the Gun Vault is my go-to store for most firearms-related purchases.< /Text>

As a new resident, I stopped by last Friday, to get  information on gun ownership in California. After a short wait, all my questions were answered and the hands on demonstration of rifle sights was excellent.  In the beginning, I advised I was not buying a weapon yet they still stayed with me, showed me weapons and answered questions.  I will be going back.</review>

Awesome shop with a very large selection of pistol and rifle. Surprisingly this small shop pack a lot of stuff. You can find everything for cleaning and metenance of fire arm.  Has also reloading component. There is a used gun section which is often displaying very nice piece. Has also some very high end gun.  Need to swing by often. Pricing is msrp on new stuff, so no surprise, that's why I put 4 star and not 5.  Staff is knowledgeable and nice to speak with. Also I never got pressured for a sale. Manager is nice to deal with. Hours are convenient. Open Saturday. And late on Wednesday.</Review>

Great selection of firearms, lots of accessories, and a customer friendly staff that's well informed and will even call the DOJ for you (to confirm laws) if they're uncertain. Seriously; I have high standards --especially when it means I could be going to jail because of ridiculous laws. This is my new shop. I'll make the drive to shop here.< /text>

The store is fairly nice and clean, staff members seem pleasant and professional, BUT...
If you call them over the phone, they will not give you their gun prices, claiming that their prices are the best of all and you just have to come in to see for yourself. This is a blatant lie. The prices are at average-to-high level.

I hate liars. 3 stars only because people were nice.<//Text>

< review>
I bought a glock from this store based on the positive google reviews.  I was shown a gun with scuff marks on the slide serration.  I pointed it out and the guy behind the counter said he will get me another one.

He showed me another one which appeared not to have the scuff mark.  He took the gun behind the counter to fill out the paper work.  He then printed out the forms with the guns serial number and had me sign.  At that point, I simply checked the gun’s serial number and signed the forms.  First mistake on my end.

I come back after 10 days and it was a different guy behind the counter.  I gave the gun a cursory glance once more and signed the papers.  Second mistake on my end again.

I get home and start examining the gun and I see the same scuff mark on the same area of the first gun shown to me.  You can only see it at certain angles but it still there and it bothers me every time I see it.

Now, I decided not to pursue it figuring the store was unlikely to replace it anyway and decided to shoot the gun the next day.  That is on me since I did not want to wait to go to the store show them plus I was excited to shoot.  I blame myself for not checking the gun one last
time before taking possession.

I probably won’t buy my guns from here in the future because I believe I was sold the first gun shown to me with the scuff marks.  Was it intentionally swapped or accidental?  I honestly don’t know.

Now I know in a year or two, the slide will probably show some scuffing/scratches due to wear.  However it’s like buying a new car, you want it blemish free when you buy it new and you accept it if you put the dings or scratches there yourself.

Bottom line, if you decide to go to this store, make sure to inspect your gun thoroughly again before you sign the paper work when you verify the serial number when you buy it and before you pick it up.</review>

Really bad service.  Placed name on list and was helped. We were shown a handgun. We like it and told him that we'll take it.  He told us to wait a min.  He went to help someone else which I thought would be a minute, but turned out to be 20 mins.

So what was the point of putting our names on the list when our guy helps another person in the middle of our service. They lost a $1800 sale. We took off feeling that we were not valued like other customers.</review>

EDIT- I decided to speak with the owner Gary K. and he assured me that he would provide me with excellent customer service. When a customer is looking to purchase a large ticket item, they are expecting that the sale of the item is done with professionalism and pride. When I meet Gary in person he was very professional and showcased outstanding customer service skills. We quickly made a deal on a Noveske rifle and it was a pleasure interacting with him. I look forward to future business dealings with Gary and maybe I can take that Tricon off his hands soon.< /Text>

I had understood that you were looking for a Gen 3 Noveske lower and I have had those on order for over a year without having one shipped to my store.

< Review>
I bought a Winchester Marine 12g riot special years ago 10+ from Gary...

Spent more time in Gary's shop like a local card shop for kids back in the day...

Very honest guy Gary!!!

Extremely knowledgable on guns...  And more...

Besides trusting the guy with my own kids and business...

Years ago I bought my 1st used gun from Gary...  45/70 Marlin 125 year anniversary special edition some guy tricked out fired once...  Had one tiny scratch on it, note: Gary pointed out....   I told Gary I was about to buy a $1400 - 30/30...

Gary said I can sell you that gun brand new or this one...

I would have never known...  How much Gary???

$750 I wanted to cry...

Years later I bought a night guard 10mm s&w revolver Gary, and two guys working the shop all agreed in that is the baddest revolver on the market in 2008...

I told Gary!!!   Is there a better gun I'll spend more money is there a better more better more reliable gun on the market right now Gary ???

Gary looked me in the eye and said it's not gonna get much better than that!!!  Specifically revolver talk note...

I just picked up a Remington 870 pistol grip for an unbelievable price$$$ picking it up This Monday...  I need for work...

Thanks for being that great/awesome patient gun guy that every gun guy needs Gary!!!

237highway/el Camino highway 11:30am  hit the road miss traffic get in get out ideal time for those living in Bay Area...

Gary is way too humble but I read an article somewhere Gary #1 dealer in California...   I don't know if that's a yearly thing or what dealer sold more guns then another Cali dealer...

That is why I drive to mt. View...

In my book, for life...

Note: I met Gary years after graduating high school...

Now I'm an old man almost 40...

Good luck everybody...< /Review>

Just stopped in for the 3rd time... Happened to be my 3rd time of not being helped in any way as well. They have a decent selection in general, just not much in terms of customer service. Prices didn't seem competitive either... Saw an SR40 marked for $529.. I picked one up less than a week ago for $540 out the door. A Pelican case that is $55 on Amazon is priced at $129!? Haha... I'll continue to do business with MilSpec Armory.<//review>

I purchased a rifle from Bay Area Gun Vault yesterday June 7th, 2012.

This is my first go at an AR and the man who i believe to be either the owner or manager of the store whose name is Gary was the most patient and helpful person I could have had the pleasure to deal with. He explained in great detail the differences between the rifles he had and was very willing to go more in depth if I had a question or didn't fully understand.
Going beyond showing me the weapons and telling me the price and taking time to make sure i was well educated is what gives them an excellent rating in my book.

I could have got a cheaper price online but i'm happy to support local business for the hundred or so bucks they will make.

I'd also like to add that people who complain about the attitude or attentions of the people in the Gun Vault probably went in with a bad attitude to begin with or were walking around with their head down like they didn't want to be talk to. Just like anything else in life be good to the people you're interacting with and they will be good to you.< /Review>

Don't do business here. In 2014, I purchased a firearm and my dros came back as being denied. I did the research and was told by a sheriffs dept that there was an outstanding warrant for my arrest. I turned myself in at the warrants desk at 850 Bryant and was told that the citatiin number attached to this "warrant" was a traffic citation that had been paid...there was no possible way for this to be a warrant. I told gary about all of this and he agreed to give me time to figure out what this was about. I refiled my dros and this time, it came back as "undetermined". I have no felonies, I've never been institutionalized, there was no actual reason for the undetermined. Gary refused to release to me, claiming he felt I would be a liability. I in turn sued Gary in small claims court where he perjured himself by claiming he had law enforcement officials that had passed info on to him. He couldn't name these officials (because they didn't exist) nor the charges (because there were none)...he was clearly trying to be a thief and the judge sided with me. This can all be found in state court records. Before the trial started, Gary assured me I would get none of my money back, which is funny because I was ready to send the sherriffs department to collect my judgement (plus extra for that lien!). Do not spend money here, Gary is a liar and a thief that does NOT support 2A rights.< /text>

I am amazed at the complaints in some of these reviews. I have been to this shop regularly for a couple of years now and have had nothing but excellent service and pricing.
The incident that won them my business was a couple years ago in the middle of the ammo drought I was looking for .22. I found a couple of boxes of CCI at another shop that was charging 19.95 per 100 rnd box. Needing more I found Bay Area Gun Vault online and stopped by, they had the same ammo for 9.99. This was the only shop I found that was not gouging for ammo. From then on they have had the majority of my business.
The sales people listen to me and then present what I would be interested in (they are almost too good at this). One of the things I hated at other shops is the constant pushing of AR style weapons. I am not interested in ARs and as such have met with rudeness at other shops. Not the case here, they realize that the way to sell a weapon is to present something the customer would be interested in.

I will never spend another cent at BAGV. I was turned away last night when I showed up for a private party transfer. The seller drove in from morgan hill and Gary the owner told me he would not do the PPT even though he is legally required to. His excuse was that he was tired of other shops "taking advantage" of the fact he does not charge storage fees and that he was tired of losing money on people who leave their guns past the 10 days so he is flat out refusing to do PPT's DO NOT GO HERE!!! I will be lodging a formal complaint with the CADOJ regarding this incident because by law he is required to process PPT's. Denying a PPT is grounds for having his FFL revoked. Send a message to this self absorbed piece of work and don't give him a cent of your hard earned money.<//text>

Did my first ever FFL transfer.  I went in to talk to them on recommendation from a friend prior to finalizing my out of state purchase.  They let me know the process as far as what to do and expect.  Once I received notification that my purchase was delivered, I went in to do the transfer.  At the same time, I needed to get my FSC(thanks California) which we squared away first.  The process was simple, the young man who helped me was informative and friendly, and I had my DROS in under an hour, FSC and all.  Clean store, lots of goodies and accessories to choose from, definitely a place where I will purchase from in the future.</text>

<Review>Mixed customer service. I walk in through the door and am greeted by a person at the counter and i explain that i am just browsing around as this is my first time in that particular shop. Instead of greeting or anything like that, his very first question is "Are you a US Citizen". I say yes.
There is a decent selection of firearms but the layout feels a little cramped. Also don't know why the staff has handguns on their holsters. Just for impressing clientele? (Although this is not unique to this particluar shop). Further staff does not acknowledge their lack of knowledge on a certain firearm but tries to bluster through. On a specific handgun they quoted some 4 months of waiting time, while its available almost immediately online.
Sticker prices for a standard m1a walnut stock are 1695, which amounts to about 1830 when including ffl and dros. you can get that for 1375 online, which amounts to about 1475 including ffl/dros/shipping.
Since the cost/service isn't outstanding, i can't recommend this shop. You can drop by to browse through the collection, but i can't recommend buying anything.
ETA:  In their response below, the owner continues to persist with deliberate misinformation (and wth is  'questioning the validity of my visit' ?). They should have offered an outright apology for the poor customer experience, but clearly they would just blame the customers instead. The 4 month wait that this shop quoted was for a springfield 1911 in 9mm. They didn't even bother checking its availability online since their intent is always to sell whatever they have in stock, at their ridiculously inflated prices. I had a local ffl get the 1911 shipped in 2 days flat. My recommnendation is still the same - Buy elsewhere.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1412566466286, 'text': "Dear Bikramjit,\nWe are always open to honest feedback or constructive criticism but we question the validity of your recent visit.  We understand that you are new to the gun world and a person can get easily confused about the process of purchasing a firearm.  We would never just ask someone if they are a US citizen unless they are looking to purchase or transfer ownership of a firearm.  The law requires that we obtain a proof of residency which is why we ask that question.  Our employees are encouraged to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights to bear arms and they wear their firearms at work in order to protect themselves.\n\nWhat was the hand gun that you were quoted 4 months of waiting time?  Waiting times can be very short or very long depending on the distributor and we would like more information from you regarding this hand gun.  We have the largest selection of firearms in the Bay Area and we make sure to put all of our firearms out on display, which can create a cramped environment on our shelves.  We never want to lose a sale by having someone walk into our shop to browse then walking out if they don’t see what they are looking for.\n\nThe price we have listed for the walnut is the loaded model, not the standard model.  It is not possible to find the loaded model online for $1,375.  We wish you would've addressed these concerns while you were here so you could see just how much we appreciate your business.  We would like to rectify this incident with you and we hope that we can regain your trust.  To further discuss this review please reach out to Gary at bayareagunvault1@gmail.com."}</Resp>< userid>

Went to look around. After being ignored for a while, longer than it should have been as the staff was in a heated discussion among themselves about the merits of two black rifle brands, a short stocky guy attempted to help me. Great, finally, there was fairly poor attitiude all the way around but these guys were not on par with the jerks at Tabors up the road in San Bruno.

To gauge honesty I did not let on my 35 yrs overall arms experience that included 20 yrs mil/LEO, 10 years professional gunsmithing, and 20 years competitive shooting.

As a point of reference I showed interest in a M4. They tried to up sell me like crazy. The retail prices were competitive but by no means the best that could be found. Since I buy wholesale I was really just looking around for fun but wanted to see what kind of place this is.

I asked a couple of questions of which I knew the answers to and realized they did not have a good handle on the topic.

On the way out (I was not buying on this trip), I was directed to look at their "vintage" guns as a last chance to well me something. "We got a good selection of WW2 guns" he said. Yeah, now we are talking. I have an extensive collection of standard issue, M1C, and M1D Garands (equivalant CMP Rack to Collector grades) and have rebuilt maybe 25 of them for clients. I know Garands,

The junk they tried to palm off was clearly rack grade (no I did not gauge them) but the pitting and wear marks told the tale - BUTwith GREAT stories attached. How he knew this particular weapon was used in the WW2 PTO is still a mystery - I should have asked.

Conclusion - good parking, fair to just about retail pricing, inexperienced help.

If you are a newbie and want to bust your gun cherry - you will likely be wowed, if you know much you will not be overlly impressed.

Maybe I should have bought that Garand that went ashore at Iwo Jima . . . it was only marked up 300% above it's actual value BUT it had a great story, what a steal!</Text>

Not your typical wine-tasting in the Funk Zone.

Vibe changes with who is behind the counter, and if you are a fan of natural wines, this is THE place to go check out. The Bubbly makes for a great mimosa, too.

There is usually a food truck close by or right in front.</Review>

So sad to have capped the night off with this wine. It is the next day hangover smell and taste in your mouth alcohol that I could not finish half a pour after spending $24 on two glasses. Highly disappointed.</text>

The servers were friendly, but not phony, and there is a nice outdoor seating area. Its not exactly cozy, and I didn't think the wines were terrific so I am going to give it a 3.</review><response>None< /response><UserId.>100655840952881713346</UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

I love that most of their wines are in the $25 range, which makes them affordable. We became wine club members a few months ago and I love the perks. We've come in with friends and family to do wine tastings (you get 2 free tastings each time) and the service is warm and super laid back. Be sure to try their Bright White, Grenache Blanc, and Bright Red (chilled). I also love that they are constantly releasing new stuff. We just tried their Chardonnay, which was superb.</text>< username>

<Text>A sad use of a treasured location. With a small selection of wine you are able to taste their full selection, though I wouldn't recommend doing so. Disengaged, uneducated (in wine) service led us to trying each wine as no recommendations or descriptions could be conjured. All the wine tasted severely corked and aren't worth the shelf space. Someone please buy this company as a turn-around. The potential is there for this shop space.<//Text>< username>

Very poor customer service.  If a crowd is getting a little too rowdy, they should talk to a responsible/sober one in the group about it so we can get the rest of our group in line.  What happened instead was the VERY rude gal just cleared our table, taking our wine glasses and all, even before we had finished all the tastings we already paid for.  We were stunned and didn't know what was happening or why she was being so rude.  She never actually told us to leave or that we were being kicked out.  She just took everything away and left us wondering WTH.  It wasn't until I went to her that she told me that part of our group was being rowdy in another part of the building.  I was very surprised that she didn't bother to communicate with us about it before or after.  For a business whose success is based on CUSTOMERS, it was amazing how POORLY these customers were treated.  I know none of us will be back to Municipal Winemakers.  Too many other great places nearby for us to put up with this one.  Hopefully they will learn to treat their customers better.<//text>

<Text>Municipal Winemakers is an awesome stop on the Urban Wine Trail! It's housed in an old diving shop and definitely has a unique feel because of that. I definitely recommend the Dark Red -- a blend of 53% Syrah and 47% Cabernet Sauvignon -- it was great and my favorite wine of the night!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<username>Phương Khanh Võ< /username><Text>I have no complaint about the desserts I’ve been trying, my favorite list is always D2, V11, M4.
And wonder about the customer service was pretty nice and the manager know is cool. The girl took my order with wrong item, but my fault that I didn’t check after check out. Then i knew my order was wrong when i was home. I called them just wanna double check what I ordered, they offer me a free dessert for next visit no matter the fault from me. Of course I won’t take the offer because I understand how hardly all business has been through this pandemic, also just wanna give a review for how nice they are.<//Text><rate>5</rate></record>

I used to love sweet things and I have been trying to eat less sweet as much as I can.  Luckily this dessert place had everything I wanted : they had so many kinds different of desserts with fruits and asian ingredients like peach gum, sesame,tofu..., very flavorful and especially is not too sweet.
Cons : the price is higher than other places<//text>

Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes. I also liked the modern interior.

<text>The almond soup tasted artificial, like it had a perfume smell to it. I don’t know much about Chinese desserts but my friend said the almond soup consistency was not legit. The black sesame soup was good. The rice ball was delicious with the sesame filling. I wish they put more rice ball in the soup. Or had the options for additional toppings. The curry fish ball was not legit and tasted average. The rice ball with peanuts and coconut and syrup was pretty good.</text><user_name>Erina K<//user_name>< rating>

Despite it all, the worker was nice and wiped down the table for us without us asking. Love that its has outdoor seating</review><user_id>104774382130163082725</user_id>< Resp>

<text>SweetHoney in any location has always been consistently good. Every item I've tried on their extensive menu have kept me satisfied. They have so many great options. A great place to try Cantonese desserts or if you just want desserts in general! Highly recommend this dessert chain.

The wait for this location isn't has bad as the ones on Arcadia or Alhambra locations (or maybe I just got lucky).</text>< pictures>

Excellent and authentic HK dessert! Lots of options to choose from in the menu. The mango with tofu and pomelo is pretty good and not too sweet, however the papaya sweet soup with the north/south almonds was overly sweet.  Had to water it down with hot water to balance the flavor. Overall a great place for HK dessert as there are none like this in the OC area.</review>

My favorite is the durian and matcha ice cream in shave ice. The durian japanese pancake was quite fluffy, but I recommend sharing it since it it gets a bit much after a few bites. Drinks are pretty good there as well. I personally like their takoyakis, but I know their not the most authentic.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Service was great. I have been to a few other locations. Overall I think this is my least favorite location. The desserts and all came out quickly. The takoyaki I know isn't a specialty here, but it came out warm not hot and that was kind of a disappointment. The flavor was just okay too. The "black pearl" vanilla and green tea ice cream was perfect though and the gyoza had a nice crunch to it that made it very enjoyable. The staff was super nice our entire stay and kept our waters full. Since this is the only location in the Garden Grove area I will likely return in the future. Check out the Alhambra locations though if you have the time.</text>< pictures>

The place was amazing, loved the portion and the items in the menu.
So good, we were probably the first customer of the day and was quiet when we got in, no wonder this place gets busy.

I loved their desserts, however the taro drink I ordered was a disappointment.</review>

Hong Kong dessert made with mangos and durian! Yes, stinky durians. There are other selections on the menus as well: soufflé pancake, mochi balls, grass jelly, tofu, drinks, etc. Give it a try. Everything is tasty!< /text>

<review>Good Taiwanese dessert shop.  The Taiwanese pancake is so airy and fluffy it's practically weightless.  The popcorn chicken is also very good.  Strongly recommend if you like Taiwanese style desserts.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>I've gone to this place a couple of times now and it's always been delicious and super clean.

You walk into a dessert place where they are busy but clean then you know they care about the location.

I usually get the rice ball with sesame and that never disappoints. We also get the jelly with ice cream mix that I don't remember the name of but the ice cream is always creamy and delicious.

I've tried their gyoza here before and it was good and I would like to try the other meat options they have as well.

Customer service is top notch and they make sure you are well accommodated .</Text><rating>5<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80dd2957310089c5:0xf1b414bb83bc9985</Gmap_id><date>1559019674986</date></record></dataset><record>

The tasty dessert saves the stars !! I have to dock the stars because of one server here !
I and my friends love the dessert here but every time we came, we always meet a grumpy guy. He seems like doesn’t really like his job much. He doesn’t smile to the customers and his attitude is unacceptable!< /Text>

Delicious unique desserts. Love this place. It's the 1st time my dad and I tried this place out. Our desserts took only about 1 minute before coming out so I'm guessing the ingredients were already ready. Our total came out to be about $35 which was totally worth it.<//text>

So after trying this place out I can honestly say that it did not wow me. The mini rice balls were not good because some were way overcooked and the others were hard. The soft tofu was a bit bitter and did not have enough sugar in the syrup to balance it out. Although it is a pretty place, it is a bit pricey for the dessert I got.</text>

Wonderful food and great variety.  Definitely not traditional American pie and cake (which I also like).  Nice clean restroom with paper towels, not just those silly blowers are the icing on the cake (pun intended).<//review>

The ambiance is nice. The customer service/wait staff are friendly! I ordered the coconut juice with red bean. The drink is a little too sweet for my taste and there are so many red beans! My recommendation is to tone down the red beans and make the coconut juice less sweet.<//Text>

After looking on yelp she found SweetHoney Dessert. It's located in a small plaza with plenty of parking. Anyway walking in...the interior is super clean and modern. This place is a Hong Kong style dessert place with different types of Hong Kong desserts like sago and sticky rice.

I wasn't super particularly hungry but I found the coconut milk sago with palm something and ordered that. My sister then went to order the mango smoothie, coconut sago with a side of fresh cubed mango, and then some fried calamari rings.

Let me just say...the portions look a little small for the sago but they're filling. Do not worry! The mango smoothie is rich and super delicious. The calamari was a bit over cooked but this is a dessert place so my expectations weren't all that high.

The service was great and the server was super helpful with all our questions regarding the assortment of desserts. Also, if you check in on yelp you can get a discount off your entire order.

Side note my sister loved it so much she went back a couple days later with some other friends. I will probably go back if I'm in the area.< /text>< Rating>

Cheated on my Keto diet.  Overall good place for dessert.  A little pricey but they got Durian desserts here and there’s no stinky smell😗🤤.  soufflé made to order.  The takoyaki was not bad either.   Stay away from the curry dumplings.< /Text>

Normally we would have to fly Hong Kong or Taiwan to eat this type of dessert! Thank you so much for bringing it to OC. This is going to be our GOTO place for desserts from now on!

Next time we're going to bring a bigger group so we can try everything and share. They have so many choices, all with descriptions and pictures to help you order. Nice touch!<//Text>< Resp>

The food was expensive for being bland. They do not make the deserts as tasty as other near by locations. Especially 85 degree does a better job and for a better price. The duriant cream pastry was especially substandard and not exceptionally tasty for $10. The tapioca pudding desert at meat fresh is also ten times better than what I was given here. Also, this business is harrassing me for leaving an honest review.</text>

<text>This is a beautiful, organized place and has great customer service. Me and my friend asked for the popular dessert which was The Snow Capped Mountains Mabao Jelly. It was delicious, not too sweet. Durian pancakes was good also, my friend really liked it.
One thing I like the most is that a bowl of dessert is not too big. This way, we can try many different kinds.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
I was totally disappointed after being amped up about trying this place out the whole day. The place is very nicely decorated with a modern touch. It is very clean and modern looking.  You can put your name on an iPad to be waitlisted. We ordered a mango pancake, it was the most disgusting thing I’ve eaten, you get a sliver of sweetened mango, stuff in this thin doughy skin, filled with a bunch of whipped cream. How is that even considered pancake is beyond me. Took a bite and pretty much tasted whipped cream, what a waste of my calorie consumption for the day. Then we had the mango pomelo sago with black jello, this was a little below average with nothing spectacular and the taste is borderline bland. The pomelo made this dessert a little bitter. The calamari ring was decent, but too oily. The best dessert for me was their red bean sesame dessert with three rice balls. I had the least hope for this order, but it was the best. Overall, I would NOT recommend this place, the portion is small, the price is high, and the taste was below average.< /review>

Whenever my friends come to town, I always have in mind to show them a really scenic bike route.

I love using this company because I just had such a great experience with them. The bike rental prices are reasonable, but more important, their customer service is up there!!

I've had problems before and they've let small issues slide by. For that, I'm grateful!</text>

Great bikes, friendly staff, and great deals, how can it get any better! Decided to rent bikes for the day to bike across the Golden Gate Bridge, and stumbled upon this place, which is located not far from free all day parking. They had a great deal on all day bike rentals, for both single and tandem bikes. I'm usually very picky about bikes, but the bikes here met all of my standards. The rental process was quick and simple, and the employees, especially Barry, were helpful in recommending route options.   If you are looking to rent bikes in San Francisco, there is no doubt Bike & View will be your one stop shop for all your bike rental needs. Give them a visit!</Review>

Best Bike & View Rentals & Tours Area! The owner, Charlie, is the best! If you call ahead and make a reservation it only takes around 10-15 minutes before your out the door on your Segway. You can Segway anywhere you want as long as you bring it back on time! The owner, Charlie, is super nice and a great Segway teacher. I've been here twice now and it gets better each time!< /Review>

<Review>We had a great experience with this company. We paid $72 for two 24 hour bike rentals and added the $8 insurance just in case. We returned the bicycles the next day but mistakenly forgot the helmets at our apartment. The staff here at Bike and View allowed us to come back the next day and return our helmets no issues. I posted a picture of the rules they have for biking. The location was also very convenient considering you're so close to the Marina. But, with that being said, when you arrive back from Sausalito ferry, you're far away, which makes for a difficult ride to return the bikes.<//Review><userid>111983726744080697412</userid><name>Vic Damone<//name>< Resp>

My worst experience so far in San Francisco. No wonder the bikes are 30% off if you book online: their quality sucks.
To start it off, the bike was noisy from the very beginning as it creaked frequently, especially when changing gears.
Later on in my ride around the coast, the chain slid off the gears when i put the bike in first gear. I was shook and scared but luckily it sorted itself out when i moved it a little.
The gear changes were oh so terrible. Every time i changed gears the transition is sudden that it could take someone less experienced off balance.
The worst part is when i was going up to legion's honor (anyone who has been there knows that its very steep) and logically i had to put the bike in the lowest gear possible. And just so I did. And just so did the chain slip again, this time for good. I had to hike the whole climb up to legion of honor then walk the bike down all the way to get myself a bus back to the trans-bay terminal to return to Berkeley.
I had to haul the broken bike with me between buses till i was back home because the shop closes at 7 and i was way out by 6:30 when this happened.
Luckily i had paid a 4$ insurance that covered the broken parts of the repairs (didn't cover the price of the buses i had to take and the struggle of hauling the bike around).
I did lose the helmet in all the confusion however. THIS was my fault and i expected to pay for it 10-20$.
This brings us to the worst part of the whole experience: the customer service. When i delivered the bike i complained to the lady there that the experience was bad because the chain slipped and i had to carry it around. The lady simply didn't care. All she cared for was the missing helmet to which she charged me 25$. She even had the audacity to tell me that they usually cost them 45$ as if trying to make me feel bad for paying 25$! It's also weird that some people compliment the service. For me, the service was very bland and I didn't receive a map of the area like some people said they got or like most other bike rentals.
The place closes at 7 and you need to get the bike before 6:45 so expect to keep the bike if you wish to explore enough of the bay (i was still exploring fort point by 5 when i took the bike at 2).
TL:DR: Unacceptable bike quality and bad customer service. Don't be lured by the 30% off discount, it's there for a reason. Pay a few bucks extra and rent from more reliable bike rentals.<//review>

Try an alternative to the big tourist traps that have a quasi monopoly of bike rentals on the waterfront. This place feels a little bit like a LBS and the service is really friendly. Prices are a little lower than the big ones, and the bicycles are good quality and well-maintained from what we've seen. They took the time to properly adjust them to our fancy bosoms. Grab a bike and knock yourself out!!!</text>

Great place for a quick and simple bike rental. The staff were friendly and the shop had good deals, making a biking day-trip around the Golden Gate Bridge area a breeze. The staff can also recommend a few scenic routes for the best tour experience. There's even free parking about 5 - 10 minutes walking distance from the shop as well!< /text>

<Review>Booked online and got a good price. Rental is in a good location, easy to find but the customer service left a lot to be desired.

Guy who served us was so dismissive. We told him we were going to cycle over the bride then take the ferry back, he told us we would miss the ferry, gave us the incorrect ferry times and that it was a 4 hour cycle. He also said the shop shut at 5.45 (it doesn’t it shuts at 6)

So unhelpful and not welcoming!

Bikes were in ok condition but a bit creaky.

The total journey to get to the ferry took 2hours (including lots of photo ops)
We got a ferry fine and we were back at the shop 30 mins before he told us it shut.

Would not recommend this place, too complacent with customer service. Spend a little more with another bike rental.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Name>

<review>Nice little shop with a friendly staff.  My family rented Bikes to go across the Golden.  Crazy but fantastic day.   My 3 stars only has to do with location and no night drop off.   The location is fine unless you go to Sausalito and ride Ferry back.  It is is closest rental place I could find to the bridge but that means when you come back on Ferry will be furthest to return your bike. Just a preference but after a long tiring day I would rather get off Ferry and not ride several miles.  This may not matter to some but I would have rather rented closer to Ferry and had a longer ride on front end and shorter on back.

Real reason I give 3 stars is they close at 7 PM and have no night drop off.  (other places have night drop offs. )There may be times of year this is no problem but the Ferry wait in Sausalito was close to 2 hrs. (no fault of bike shop) Most places you read about this say be an hour early to Ferry line but it took us much longer.  Ended up landing at the Ferry Building with a 4 mile Bike Ride back to the Bike Shop.  We had about 25 minutes to ride the traffic gauntlet (family of 5).  We barely made it but it was an insane sprint for my kids especially.  A night drop would have solved all.  This is entirely subjective and depends on your needs.  Location closer to Ferry I would give them 3 1/2 stars.  Night drop off for the bikes and I would give them 4 1/2.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

This place was literally 10 mins walk from our hotel. Renting was pretty easy - we booked online and then showed up next morning around 10am. They made us sign some waivers - gave us the maps of suggested places to stop at on our way to Sausalito and off we went ! It was mostly downhill or flat from the shop and we stopped at almost all the points on the map (Wave Organ being my personal favorite!). Getting on to the bridge is the only steep uphill and the bikes were actually able to gear-shift through the ride, powered by my burning knees ofcourse. Downhill to Sausalito past  Golden Gate Vista point was the most fun and highly recommended. Once in Sausalito, we parked our bikes at the ferry terminal, purchased our return tickets, grabbed food and beer at Joinery and then hopped back on the ferry to SF. All in all an amazing experience to bike the bridge - highly recommended!<//review>

The sale person called me a looser! Could you believe it!
To bring some precise data, I rented a couple of bicycles on the last 03/11/16 in bike & view (1172, Lombard st) the sale person involved was short, brown skin and wore glasses.
During my day rental, I had a flat tire and had to bring the bicycle to a repair shop on my way to Tiburon (Which made me loose part of my day).
When I returned the bicycle, the man did not want to refund the repair insisting on the fact that I did not pay for the insurance.
When I complained about the status of the tire of his bicycle the man lost his temper, started insulting me, and called me literally a looser.
Believe me or not but the tire was out of any manufacturer tolerance limits coming to the remaining groove.
I only drove on specific designated bicycle paths and followed every recommendation. Why would I have to make myself responsible for the complete mechanical status of the bicycle, which obviously lacked of maintenance? The clauses of this rental shop are not only abusive but the behavior of the salesperson was humiliating when I was claiming for what, in my opinion, was fair to claim!
By the way, I lost my boat back from Tiburon due to this issue and could not return the bicycles on the same day as I had planned. This issue not only made me loose part of my rental day but also delayed my travelling, as I had planned to leave San Francisco the following day early and had to wait for the bike shop opening (9am).
I never got my money back.< /text>

I found this bike rental company next to my hotel on Lombard street and I rented two bikes from them the next day to ride the Golden Gate Bridge. They were extremly friendly and professional. The bikes are great and they have the best price in San Francisco compare to the other companies. If you are staying near Lombard street, rent from them and you won't be regret.<//review>

TO AVOID! Very bad experience, customer service is really bad. The old woman salesperson is rude and impolite. bikes are not well entertained and you can wait even a half an hour before getting taken care off. Fortunately, there was another bicycle rental business not far. We would rather pay more money to rent but not to rent here anymore!!!!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Everything was great and unique,
Must have experienced it yourself, but ...

... there are also two experiences
which we did not read correctly from the offer description, or are not mentioned at all.

First of all, that is being forced on the spot,
to complete a bicycle insurance for $ 8 (two person) and
second, that the tour ends at the port of Sausalito.

This means you have to drive back across the bridge alone or take the ferry for about $ 25 (2 people).

Also, you should know that the use of an e-bike for a surcharge of USD 25 is possible, but e-bikes are not taken on the ferry.

All this should be in the offer description,
supplemented or more clearly expressed.
Otherwise, a highlight that was missing on any sightseeing from San Francisco.

Especially positive, we noticed the tour guide,
who cared very carefully our group with about 20 people,
Therefore an honest and 100% recommendation from us.

(Original)
Alles super und einmalig,
muss mann selber erlebt haben, aber …

… es gibt auch zwei Erfahrungen,
die wir aus der Angebotsbeschreibung so nicht richtig herausgelesen haben, bzw. gar nicht erwähnt werden.

Das ist zum einem, dass man vor Ort genötigt wird,
eine Fahrradversicherung für 8$ (zwei Person) abzuschließen und
zum anderen, dass die Tour am Hafen von Sausalito endet.

Das bedeutet, man muss alleine über die Brücke wieder zurückfahren oder für ca. 25$ (2 Personen) die Fähre nehmen muss.

Auch sollte man wissen, dass die Nutzung eines E-Bikes gegen Aufpreis von USD 25 möglich ist, aber E-Bikes nicht auf der Fähre mitgenommen werden.

Dies alles sollte in der Angebotsbeschreibung,
ergänzend oder deutlicher zum Ausdruck gebracht werden.
Ansonsten, ein Highlight was bei keinem Sightseeing von San Francisco fehlen sollte.

Besonders positiv, war uns der Tourguide aufgefallen,
der sehr umsichtig unsere Gruppe mit ca. 20 Personen betreut hatte,
deshalb eine ehrliche und 100%ige Weiterempfehlung von uns.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The boss speaks Chinese, the service is good and the explanation is very careful
But if you ride a bike to sausalito and take the ferry back, there is still a way to get from the ferry disembarkation point

但如果是騎腳踏車去sausalito再搭渡輪回來，從渡輪下船地點到這邊還有段路<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Good bike and good location! The staff can speak Mandarin and there is no problem in communication! And suggested that if we ride to Sausalito or Tiburon to take ferry back! Although it is headwind from there to the Golden Gate Bridge, it is okay for our family! Highly recommend booking bikes online! Can save a lot of money!

(Original)
Good bike and good location! 员工可说普通话在沟通上没有问题！ 并建议我们如果骑去Sausalito或是Tiburon乘ferry回来！虽然从那里到金门桥都是逆风但是对我们一家人来说还是可以的！强力推荐网上预订自行车！可以省很多钱！<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I took the rental bikes here because with Alcatraz package, a little dated given the other bikes around because San Francisco is not flat, the gearbox responded after 100 meters ....

(Translated by Google) We rented a tandem to cross the GG that was in very poor condition. we could not finish our bike ride and much less back that way what we meant spending 12usd ferry. The owner was limited only to tell us that we should know that tamdem are not to do these walks, when was the first thing we said when we entered the premises. It has positive comments that make you a 10off if you publish. Nothing else.

(Original)
Nos alquilaron una tamdem para cruzar el GG que estaba en muy malas condiciones. No pudimos terminar nuestro recorrido en bicicleta y muchísimo menos volver de ese modo lo que nos significó gastar 12usd en ferry. El dueño sólo se limito a decirnos que nosotros debíamos saber que las tamdem no son para hacer esos paseos,  cuando fue lo primero que le dijimos cuando entramos al local. Tiene comentarios positivos porque te hace un 10off si lo publicas. Nada más.</Review>

I just moved in last week. I just want to say “I love it”. Give 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ First of all, Dave, Jonathan, Danny. They made my move smoothly and quickly. Jonathan answered the email so quickly and professionally, Dave was so welcomed and kind, friendly, professional, also fixed my gate code within one min. Danny is very polite and friendly, precisely guided me on my tour. Everyone at Avalon Woodland Hills is absolutely amazing and wonderful!!! Also, building is so quiet and can sleep deeply. I feel at home, with a BEAUTIFUL VIEW! Security is very strong, the building is clean always. I love their strictness. I feel so safe. I received NEXT LEVEL SERVICE!!! And lots of palm trees and greens, great landscapes around the apartment. Also building is very special. I think a great architect designed this building. I see all patio is different size and shape, special exit stairs, etc. I can't find this kinda apartment building and room in LA. but there is nothing like AVALON WOODLAND HILLS. Also Ventura Blvd is eligible for “AT&T superfast fiber internet with low price. Everything is GREAT! I love living here, I am enjoying and grateful every day! Thanks so much, Avalon Woodland Hills! 😊❤️🎶🙏🏻<//review>

I was a residence at Avalon Woodland Hills in Building 2  and I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the way the management team and maintenance team handle everything in a professional way. Their maintenance team was always there when we had a repair and they took their time to fine tune things until we were satisfied. Most importantly we had to be relocated to another Avalon property due to personal reasons and Yoda Banker could have not been more understanding of our situation. Yoda was not only professional but extremely kind to our request. This property is lucky to have him and we were very sad to leave this property because of finding people like this to work with is extremely rare. We thank you for everything and we wish you and your team the best of luck.</Text>

The amenities are beautiful, the maintenance team always resolve any issues within 24 hours and customer service is great. A special thanks to Jonathan from the leasing office who always provides excellent customer service.</Review>

Hi Sidney

Please, if there’s a legally department, could I get their contact information to try resolving the issue friendly between us without the court & compensations for all things effected on my life after they an illegally kick me out and did not get me my money back despite I told the police that I’ve witnesses and all evidences that one’s of the workers at the leasing office was agreed with Hamoud to play this game upon me besides that there were two of witnesses when I gave Hamoud the cash for rent. Now I’m ready to get my right back if you’d like to meet me for looking on the appropriate solutions together or at the court as you like.

I’m looking forward to hearing from you ASAP.
Appreciate it.</review>

Neighbors keep talking so loud at night. There is people yelling and fighting. What is going on? I can’t even sleep. The office just lets anybody in. I told them multiple times but nothing. No change. There is also smell of weed and cigar that feels suffocating.</Review>

Worst experience ever... my neighbor building 4 in unit 207 been having issues with his living situation for the last few months. the A/C in his unit is broken and when he contacts the Maintenace team to repair the AC he gets told that my he issue is not essential. My neighbor is a disabled person and they are taking advantage of him. I hope he files a lawsuit against them because now there is a heat wave coming to our area and he might suffer and get sent to the hospital. I hope I never run In to the same issue as him. I am writing g this review to help him. Poor guy< /Review>

The most awful place I've ever lived at. Please do not even consider living here for your own sake. Paid $24,000 of rent in a year just to be left with extremely poor communication by the staff, broken appliances, broken elevators, and broken washers/dryers that were all left that way for weeks at a time. The office staff is inexperienced and gives their residents different information that is unreliable. Even worse when you attempt to call the office with questions, you do not have the option of speaking with a representative, you are immediately sent to an automated voicemail and they DON'T return your calls if it's an inconvenience to their business. Absolutely terrible service. Save your money and time, run!!!< /text>

I’ve been here for over a year, I renewed my lease not too long ago because I love living here! It is so safe and a clean apartment complex! Daniel in the leasing office helped me since day one and is the very best. They organize little events for us which is always fun. Everyone is so sweet & kind, the maintenance workers also go out of their way to help. This place really is the best place to live in Woodland Hills.</review>

<text>Awesome! Amazing! Home! We are about 9 days short of our first year here. It is difficult for any organization to maintain a hundred percent satisfaction for a full year. I've read some of the reviews from some of my fellow tenants that don't quite paint a picture of satisfaction. Everyone has different expectations and different experiences because we live in different units. So I don't want to say that the noise is not an issue for them. However, the residences at Pacific City receive a 100% satisfaction reading from me after a full year. I still feel as if I'm living at a resort full-time. The staff has had a few changes over the past year but there has been no let down in the quality of the service. Someone at</text></record>

Lived here for almost a month, definitely a great place to live with straight access to the freeway and close to many shopping and food options.

Our leasing agent Sydney was very friendly and answered all of our questions that helped me decide to stay at Avalon Woodland Hills.<//Text>

<text>My daughter and her friend lived in one of the apartments for a little less than a year. They paid for the clean sweep service in case they did not get a chance to clean everything to the correct standard, plus it included carpet cleaning. We just received an invoice stating that they are being charged for replacing the carpet so they kept their cleaning deposit AND are charging them an additional $472. This is a complete rip off. When they moved in the carpet was clean but old. They were hardly ever at the apartment so I find it very hard to believe they did so much damage that it needs replacing. After reading the reviews I see that they were not the only ones charged to have the carpets replaced. It's a scam. BEWARE!<//text>< pictures>

<user>115466379404590861945< /user><review>It’s been less than two weeks and I’m already looking for a new place by the time the lease is up. I ignored the bad reviews on yelp because I figured most places have bad reviews and it’s usually not that bad. It’s really that bad. The process to move in was the only good experience. The tour was great, My husband and I were approved less than 24 hours later. Move in day is when it went downhill. The apartment wasn’t ready during the orientation. Broken doors. Missing doors. Broken blinds. Everything is beyond cheap and you can tell by the layers of chipped paint people move in and out rapidly. My first apartment I stayed in was for 3 years. My second apartment I was there for 7 years. So I was truly looking for a long term stay but I can’t imagine staying here. We still have a missing door that’s been completely ignored by staff. I even called Avalon headquarters and nothing- maintenance has told me twice they’d come measure and order a door yet have never showed up to measure. Our heater was broken for the first week of living here and it was freezing cold 50 degrees for a week before having the HVAC replaced. Every time you open or close the blinds at least one falls off and or the stick breaks off. One of the ignitors on our stove is broken and the first time I used it - it broke off and filled the whole apartment with gas, fire department had to come. It’s been a miserable week and a half. Many of the men in the building are so uncomfortable I can’t even walk my dog to the dog area without men within building grounds driving slowly yelling out the window. I have never experienced any thing like this ever. I’m super disappointed.</review>< Date>

Athenna is a great person to deal with. I recommend if you have any issues go straight to her she is very open minded and her willingness is great. I have had many complications at this property to the point where I wanted to break my lease but she is the reason I renewed my lease because her customer service and personality. She should be in management she deserves it. They need more people with great customer service and a good attitude. I see why she sits in the front. She isn’t stuck up. She’s a very genuine  and a hardworking woman. And she’s very pretty!

To add on

Thank you to Avalon Woodland Hills staff and maintenance especially Ashley Cummings the maintenance supervisor. She heard what I was concerned with , listened and took care of everything that I mentioned to her. Her willingness to help after many times of me coming to the office. She was able to make things happen in a fast and timely manner and went over and beyond . Thank you Ashley for all your help and listening to me and making things better! I am now happy with my apartment . Great customer service by her .< /review>

Great apartment, solid location, and a staff that really cares about residents -- I like coming home here. But it really is the people that make everything worthwhile. I like the residents and staff, and Chantalle (supervisor) in particular is wonderful. She remembers the smallest details, asks after my dog, and always wants to know if there's anything more she could be doing. There are many people who live here and work here,  but somehow Chantalle makes us feel really special.  Thank you!</text>

<Review>Think more carefully when you want to move in because things changed a lot when you move out!!! Once I was so satisfied with what I can get here a year ago. But now they are charging me thousands of dollars when I move out and that's after days of cleaning!!!! Cockroaches exist when we move in and they hide behind the refrigerator. There is no way to tell they exist when I move in!! Or maybe you need to inspect everywhere. But they are charging $300 for pest control!!! That's crazy. Not mentioning $800 for carpet replacement as there is stain in the carpet. When I dispute the charges, they said these all stated in your lease! So you need to read every words carefully on the lease! Because they will steal your money based on these words! DO NOT CHOOSE AVALON!< /Review>< Name>

< Review>
My wife was resident of this apartment about four years and she never seen this problem before. Long story short, the apartment management decided to towing cars from visitors parking without any warnings. I don’t want to tell park tenants cars in that spot is ok, but it becomes norms after many years for all residents or their guests to park cars there peacefully. However, I changed my plan to stay here longer and I never renew my lease. The only thing I got here is they don’t care about their rates and reviews. So, better be think about it before moving here, you never going to get the value which you paid for it😢<//Review>

I purchased the move-out cleaning service and now I'm being charged $1000 because of pet hair. Avalon of Woodland Hills took pictures of the carpet with pet hair on it, and they decided to rip up the carpet and replace. I ask you, HOW DOES THE CLEANING FEE NOT ENCOMPASS BASIC VACUUMING? Corporate employees have straight up told me 'It is what it is...' Now THAT'S great customer service. Oh, and they wouldn't let us speak to a manager. SERIOUSLY?! I cannot believe this at all. We paid for cleaning because the leasing office PUSHED it on us. The leasing employee upon walkthrough said there was NO VISIBLE DAMAGE (and he referred to our carpets as well). I could have easily vacuumed the apartment. The rugs were not damaged, they had hair on them. This is ridiculous and an abuse of power. Other than this complete cr*p -- I've seen two dead rats in the middle of our community, and one very much live one. We've had someone sh*t on the the stairs leading up to the gated complex twice (which isn't gated very well because the doors are always busted). And we've had a junkie spend the night right outside our (again "gated") apartment. A stone's throw away from our sleeping baby. BUYER BEWARE.</text></record></dataset><record>

The maintenance people are the absolute best! Specifically, Renzo and Erick are the greatest and have always treated us and our kids with the utmost respect and promptness. I don’t think we’ve ever waited more than 24 hours for any type of repair.</Text>

Juan Franco on the Maintenance Team has been amazing! He has serviced my unit on several occasions from plumbing, air-conditioning, etc to being an advocate for us when it came to upgrading my floors to hardwood.  He has a wealth of experience that includes electro-mechanical which deemed to come in handy when servicing my refrigerator recently. Juan is always very prompt with mitigating issues with the interior and exterior of the apartment. He is also great with follow-ups if for some reason a part needs to be ordered and the work cant be completed same day.  Juan has provided a high level of service and I appreciate his calm and cheerful demeanor even in my most irate moments.<//Review>

I’ve had issues with the leasing department and their maintenance manager. I sent an email out about construction noise/times and got a canned response. So I had to go the leasing office 3 times in one day (don’t go at 9:30 am when the official is officially open, because there will be a sign that says it’s closed, or at least in my experience). When I came in to speak to Daniel Morales it was clear he didn’t read the most recent email I sent hours before. I had also spoken to another leasing agent that said Daniel would call me back at a certain time, and he didn’t. In addition, the third time I went to the leasing office, I spoke to the maintenance manager and she gave me grief for seeking out an additional 30 minutes of sleep (to go in line with the initial letter sent of construction times) and she sad verbatim:  “Really, an extra 30 minutes of sleep is going to make a difference to you?”

Also the elevators in building 7 have an expired elevator certificate dating back to 2017 (seemingly coinciding with the multiple issues its had), so rider beware.< /text>

<review>I moved in to this community two months ago and so far everything is great. The leasing office is always there to help when I need them.

I really have to leave a review as I can’t thank the staff enough verbally. I am a resident at this property. I dropped my iPhone and wallet on the parking area while in a rush sending my kid to school. I was so worried looking around and the maintenance staff told me they had kept them with the security. Thanks Joe and the whole team for the high integrity and honesty to make this apartment a safe and trustworthy place for all families living here! We have the best management and maintenance team here at Avalon Woodland Hills!!< /Text>

If you value your safety and piece of mind STAY AWAY!!!! I’ve lived in the complex since June 2018 and my car has been egged multiple times. The first time I reported it I received a $50 credit to my account and an apology. The last time, last week I was again presented with an apology and a notice that they’re going to review the camera footage. I haven’t heard anything back so I decided to email the manager as well as write reviews so people know just how this overpriced “luxury” safe complex really is and if I can reach the headquarters I’m going to ensure they know as well. This is utterly rediculous for a place charging almost $3K a month. The access gate may as well not even be there because people sit, wait, and follow someone into the grounds. There’s no accountability at all unless you wish to break your lease because of what clearly has the potential to be a hate crime. No one should be required to stay somewhere they don’t feel safe and especially if no one does anything about it. I’m afraid for my safety, on the bottom floor where people walk past my bedroom and guest room windows. I double check the stairway before walking up and I’m constantly on guard. I’ve had to train my dogs to use pads to relieve themselves for fear of walking around in the dark alone. I’m used to businesses taking care of patrons and attempting to correct issues and this has not happened with my experience here. If I could leave a negative star rating I would because I can’t wait until my jailtime here is OVER!!!< /review>

< Review>
Most of the staff is completely unaware of what their responsibilities are. I've had one positive interaction with a staff member, and even that one didn't appropriately handle concerns. Building smells like pot, no one cleans up after their animals and management is about as poor as I have ever encountered.

<Text>Don't move here!
This is the worst Avalon Ever!
I used to live in Avalon Pasadena and Avalon Encino, the both were great! But here.... Not At alllll
Crickets every corner of the apartment !Place filled with dog poop and urine! Noisy neighbors! Employees in the office don't care about residents (specially Daniel)
just the maintenance team are good!
The luxury apartment just a joke:))
Fortunately I moved out and Definitely not recommended!<//Text>< pictures>

This is the worst place I have lived in. I was pinned down and another tenant tried to rape me. I was next pulled out of my apartment and almost stabbed in the neck. Avalon did nothing although I made a police report and I took the knife in. The police established assault with a deadly weapon. They people lived and or still live upstairs nothing happened to them at all.
Michelle a so called manager cornered me when I was leaving with her associate and were very rude and forceful with me and I was attacked. On top of that there were 6 witnesses.
To top it off my car was stolen from my parking space 5 weeks ago by a gang member.
I do not recommend living here. The hallways smell like pee and this is supposed to be non-smoking I smell cigarettes daily and cigarette butts all over. The management here is the worst I have encountered.

Yes I am moving. Do not recommend.< /Review>

If you value your safety and piece of mind STAY AWAY!!!! I’ve lived in the complex since June 2018 and my car has been egged multiple times. The first time I reported it I received a $50 credit to my account and an apology. The last time, last week I was again presented with an apology and a notice that they’re going to review the camera footage. I haven’t heard anything back so I decided to email the manager as well as write reviews so people know just how this overpriced “luxury” safe complex really is and if I can reach the headquarters I’m going to ensure they know as well. This is utterly rediculous for a place charging almost $3K a month. The access gate may as well not even be there because people sit, wait, and follow someone into the grounds. There’s no accountability at all unless you wish to break your lease because of what clearly has the potential to be a hate crime. No one should be required to stay somewhere they don’t feel safe and especially if no one does anything about it. I’m afraid for my safety, on the bottom floor where people walk past my bedroom and guest room windows. I double check the stairway before walking up and I’m constantly on guard. I’ve had to train my dogs to use pads to relieve themselves for fear of walking around in the dark alone. I’m used to businesses taking care of patrons and attempting to correct issues and this has not happened with my experience here. If I could leave a negative star rating I would because I can’t wait until my jailtime here is OVER!!!< /Review>

Car Break-ins are frequent. The management just says "very sorry about this" and does nothing much to improve the situation. Rents are so high and apparently security is "courtesy patrol" I want to live in a secure space especially when im paying so much every month. Security is quite sluggish. I see suspicious people walking /cars driving around the community without any check.<//review>< gmapID>

Athenna in the leasing office was amazing. She made my transition from eaves woodland hills to avalon extremely smooth. Her professionalism was very evident. I am a business owner and I could only hope that all my employees can exhibit the same level of excellence demonstrated by athenna.</Review>

<Review>For the 1st 2 years of my stay I was pretty happy with how things were going I will say maintenance is on top of getting things fixed when requested the amenities in the building are awesome but ther are definitely some downsides to living here 1st I will discuss how management does little to make sure residents are happy my personal storage in the building was broken into last year and it took them four days to change the Broken lock to my storage Because I didn't have a police report yet never were they apologetic or caring that $1500 worth the bikes were stolen from my storage I let that go...recently after living here for 3 years and requesting a parking space in my own building from day one and was told there was no available spaces and no waiting list I watched 3 people in my hallway including someone I referred to the apartment get spaces in my building And after explaining to them the safety concerns of having to cross a major driveway with no stop signs with my 3 kids and almost being hit on numerous occasion they inform me that there were 2 spaces available and that they would submit it for approval and I could use the spaced until approved after 3 weeks I was told that I wasn't approved Because I received a discounted rate when I moved in and saved $30 after explaining to them that actually the $30 I saved the 1st year They added to my remt increase the 2nd year making my rent increase a $150 the 2nd year I moved and a $120 each  Following year They then told me that it was out of their hands.... after contacting Avalon Bay customer service I was told it is actually up to the  Management at the building.When I contacted management again they then told me that the parking spot was previously given away to a tenant on floor 3  And that I would be put on a waiting list. It's pretty ridiculous that a tenet of 3 years would be put on the back burner compared to Tenets that just moved in ....How does someone I refer to mov in get a space in the same building 6 months after moving in and I'm just being placed on a waiting list ....I'm very disappointed with the way management has handle these situations besides the constant lies  And run around that I have been fed....it feels like your just here to pay rent and they could care less if you are unhappy and move out...I hope this situation can be resolved quickly so I can maybe have a better opinion!</Review>< Time>

<review>Sorry, this is long over due......I hardly do Facebook , Twitter or any of this social media.  I still read my newspapers and glossy magazines.  I miss the dial up phone and the peace and quiet of the world.....all this technology is just too much .....

But anyways, back to the review....I like Avalon..... leasing office is great....always so helpful and lots of smiles and good coffee!!

Maintaince is great.  They will go beyond what's needed. Erick, Joe, and Renzo are the best.  They will help you with your maintenance needs...honestly.

I am not able to write a review  again......so I am updating this......love Avalon..   .they really understand your needs when you need a solution.   The trees at Avalon needed to be cut as the buds were falling on my balcony.  Christopher and Juan Franco was very helpful in pushing thus project ahead of time needed to be scheduled. Now I can finally enjoy my balcony without sweeping   over and over.!    Thanks Avalon!!!!!!<//review>< pics>

<Review>It was a great start with the leasing experience.
However, once moved in, things started to go downhill.
The complex is dirty. They don’t upkeep the public areas. The corridors are filthy. They hardly ever pick up the trash in the elevator lobbies. The garage is filthy and there have been several robberies.
The move out experience was dreadful.
I was there for 1 short year and they confiscated my deposit and charged me ridiculous amounts for painting and cleaning. I never hung a picture on the wall! I never , in my renting experience, was charged for painting / cleaning.
I left the apartment in great condition.
Beware- they will take your deposit and force you to pay for painting and anything that is done to turn the apartment over to a new tenant.
I don’t recommend the Avalon at Woodland Hills.

<review>i totally loved the experience i got moving to avalon woodland hills and is because of Manny, from the beginning to the end he explained the process and considering that i was moving from another state he made it super easy to move-in and was always available when i had any question, i personally think he deserves a raise and promotion because of his great customer service and i recommend avalon woodland hills to anyone that's looking for a home because is a great area, nice and quite.</review><UserId.>115950790170518129585</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Athenna is an amazing individual. From the moment she greeted me to my move in day. I’ve lived here since June. I am used to luxury living but the apartment she found for me suits me. Top floor with one of the best views. I have been to many properties but the impression Athenna made is by far the best. Her charisma, and the way she carries herself is impressive. Very caring but mostly a sincere individual. Such an assett to this company. Athenna thank you for the experience thus far. Keep smiling and continue to be yourself. You will go very far in life. Companies will be very happy with the way you work and represent them. Thank you Avalon for the experience< /Review>< user_id>

I want to say the leasing office here at avalon Woodland Hills has really been so helpful. For instance, when I had an issue with my ticker for gate access, Athenna my favorite leasing office agent helped me.

I called to see about an apartment and Athenna gave me full details and answered all my questions- she sold the property to me on the phone and what made it better was when i was able to put a face to her name- let me tell you about her personality. Nothing but amazing all around.best experience i have had . The process went so fast and productivs. She knows how to sell but mostly her charachter you cant find too much of.

< review>
It was a great start with the leasing experience.
However, once moved in, things started to go downhill.
The complex is dirty. They don’t upkeep the public areas. The corridors are filthy. They hardly ever pick up the trash in the elevator lobbies. The garage is filthy and there have been several robberies.
The move out experience was dreadful.
I was there for 1 short year and they confiscated my deposit and charged me ridiculous amounts for painting and cleaning. I never hung a picture on the wall! I never , in my renting experience, was charged for painting / cleaning.
I left the apartment in great condition.
Beware- they will take your deposit and force you to pay for painting and anything that is done to turn the apartment over to a new tenant.
I don’t recommend the Avalon at Woodland Hills.

<text>I've recently moved in to the Avalon Woodland Hills and I am glad to say that its been a very refreshing experience. Athenna was my leasing contact and she has been a tremendous leasing agent. She made sure I got the apartment of my choice and walked through all the important stuff prior to move in. Her friendly nature only made the entire process even easier. Regarding the community, Avalon WH does sure seem very promising. The community is clean, frequent patrols by the security makes you feel secure, well maintained dog area, etc. So far I have had a very good experience with the move in and the first week, hope to have a good year of residence with Avalon WH.</text>< Pics>

Daniel is a great person of contact, we moved from out of state and he was able to handle everything remotely without an issue. The complex is beautiful and is very pet friendly with a little fenced in area for dogs to run freely right on the side of the property. There is security patrolling the area, but I am concerned with the ease of non residents being able to access the facilities. There is a gate at the front of the complex but it remains open long enough for cars to tag along behind you. The pool and workout areas are accessed with a keyfob but I've seen other residents open the gate/doors for strangers who ask to get in. We've been here for about three weeks and I've seen the security guard several times throughout the day, which puts me at ease. It still makes me uneasy about these people potentially breaking into my mailbox, I wish those were more secure or had obvious security cameras.

But the complex is gorgeous and modern with nice utilities and a friendly staff.<//Text>

Athenna Gets 5 Stars!!! She was Great, Lively, and Fun! I had such a Great Experience There meeting her, i felt like I Gained a New Friend! She is Awesome!! She gave me an Unforgettable informative and fun tour, where i laughed a whole lot and got Great information about the apts. The apts look nice, but the 3 stars are for their 3rd party approval company that they use along with their "Approvals," and so-called $150.00 move in "Special." My credit scores are Good! I Mean Good Enough To Get Approved for even more expensive apt complexes, loans etc! They pulled my credit, gave me a hard inquiry, and told me i need a cosigner or put down $1950 EXTRA!! Huh??!! No Way!!! That Sounded like a Scam To Me! I was Really confused and upset at first, but it just sounds like a game to me. Athenna is Great, but Avalons' "Approval" process is a Joke! No Thank You :(</text>

<Review>Security Deposit  - consider this a gift to Avalon Bay for the use of their facility. You will not be provided with a justifiable explanation for the confiscation of your security deposit.  I have no children and lived alone; there were no crazy red juice or wine stains left on the carpet and I even had a video in which I walked through the entire apartment. There were NO stains left within the carpet that a basic carpet shampooer could not remove. I only stayed in the unit for 7 months so it was not like I had worn the carpet down over time. Avalon Bay charged me $1000 for a full carpet replacement. Honestly it is not something I am angry over; it just saddens me that so many Corporate citizens have baked into their everyday business practices the act of gouging everyday citizens. I am actually in another one of their properties right now and you would think that would mean something to them. I feel awful that I have to pay a company like this rent for another 11 months when I know they could care less about me. Really crummy Avalon Bay. Very disappointed resident.  Also Avalon this is a rhetorical comment. I do not desire a response or pacification. I am simply informing fellow Californian residents of my experience with you. I do not need to be nor do I ever wish to speak to any representatives of your company again. I will pay my rent to you until I am able to free myself from you without a huge financial penalty.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1502479767113, 'text': 'Dria, I’m sorry for your experience and frustration, and I can certainly appreciate you feeling so frustrated that you don’t want to talk to us, but we’d hate for you to live another 11 months with us and not feel like you can talk to us or bring any issues to our attention.

I want to shoutout and say thank you to Sandra for helping me out through the process of moving in. But I really want to give a big thank you to the awesome Athenna for showing me the beautiful loft when I was making inquiries. It was a furnished loft and it was the last one available to rent. I was really impressed with all of the designs in loft and really pleased with how Athenna showed me the loft.  Athenna gave me a follow-up Call to see if I was still interested and made the paper work process really smooth. She was really friendly and very interactive and I really liked that about her personality. Even after move-in When she saw me around the residence she would still ask how I am enjoying the new place and if everything is okay with the unit. I'm in love with this place. Great team here at avalon Woodland Hills.<//Review>

My leasing agent was cordial and professional, Mr. Manny Montes, he made the contractual process very easy and I was very specific regarding which side/floor of the building I wanted my apartment located and he quickly found a suitable option which I agreed on; Athena who was not my primary leasing agent nonetheless she was also very respectful, accommodating and professional as well. First day I moved in my smoke detector was sounding off due to a low battery I walked down to the leasing office and was greeted by Sandra who assured me the service request would be resolved hopefully that same day but by the latest next day (it was already approaching late afternoon); sure enough Sandra got someone in 35 minutes, I was very impressed with the service she and her team executed... Sandra herself was very kind, caring and professional. In all, I have not had any issues and I'm enjoying my stay at the Avalon WH. I'm a prior home owner (market was high so I sold) and went back to renting so obviously I had my doubts about any rental lease I was going to sign as you always will find some kind of negative reviews on the internet, some truthful and some out of spite and revenge, mainly about unprofessionalism of staff, poor security, unclean/unsafe community Avalon WH had the least complaints if any so I trusted them as my new home, decent track record; lets face it renting is renting, owning is owning totally different worlds and experiences.< /text>< user>

The staff was fantastic and the experience of living there was great. But, when it came time to move out they took my deposit and charged me for a full remodel. Carpets could have been shampooed but I take responsibility for the fact that there was normal wear and tear tracking by the front door instead ob just doing that room they decided to redo all the carpet in the apt. Again I don't mind paying for what I did but I was charged 200 for reprinting the whole unit when for the year that we lived there I never hung anything on the walls or had furnature up against them. I challenged this and a day later they said sent me an email saying "after carful review we deem these charges valid". When asked for proof they send me pictures of the floors and stuff they needed to clean but none of the walls. When asked why convienently there was no pictures of the walls they told me that pictures were a curtecy and not necessarily. This is the thing I'm 3 years sober live pay check to pay check trying to restart my life. Just now have I got my credit pack to normal. So I have to options take them to small claims court and it would cost more money that I don't have or let it mess up my credit and my mothers who consigned. Avalon is a big company know knows that so why not send me a bill when they know that I don't have a choice but to pay. Ps Daniel is amazing again only problem I had with Avalon is the bill they stuck me with after move out other than that they are fantastic.< /review>

< Review>
I lived for a year in here and from the get go it was bad, I'm a single mother two children, I when to sign the lease and paid the deposit every thing seem fine they where getting my money, they told me to come back to get the keys to move in in a week or so I did by then I have call every place to make the address change and have my stuff and kids with me, they told me we make a mistake we can't give you this apartment you have kids, which I stipulated from the beginning, the manager offer to find an apartment with in the area so I can move some where else, but I did not left I stood and for a whole year I recived constant complaints that I was too noisy even when I wasn't at the apartment, that my balcony was over saturated whit stuff which was emty, they complain about the poop of my dog and I don't have one, I have a washer and dryer inside the apartment, every time I used them they came to knock on my door that I was being noisy.
Finally the lease was almost up and they send me a rent increase for $400, so I turn down the new lease, I cleaned the apartment and have it ready for them one week before the lease was up they told me if you return your keys before the due date you have to pay $300, so I waited for the exact day printed on my lease which I have save just in case, they call me to let me know that I felt to follow the exact date to return the key and now I need it to pay $400, I was already out, so I told them I had the lease with me and the exact date as they indicated, they insisted for a $400 due so I said maybe we can settle this at court so the Judge can see the lease and how you have harras me for this whole year....
The person in charge said ok I will review the dates but if you have your lease with you we maight need a copy, I said I have it, she never call. me back again..
so do I recommend living here yea sure if you like this way of living.

In responce to Avalon management now, to the Avalon management I lived, doesn't sound as it has changed a great deal, in order to place a complain about any one in there has to go trough specific people that either don't care or whant to keep an image that is not real,  because of my review I got contact it by Avalon, where they confirmed I was I tenant there, I did not specified dates but they weren't happy I tell the truth, when I lived there I try solve the issues by talking to them and always it was as if I was talking to the wall, next day another fake complain of noise when most of the time my apartment was empty, because I was at work, it was annoying to arrive to complains  every day....

Why did I make a review now, because .... that is it just because...
the same reason  I got picked on then just because ... the only thing I did was to find a place to live and have children was enough for them to pick on me...
I do not want to cut a deal to remove my review it will stay, I did not sue then but I should have, and if there is any one else that is been on the same spot don't wait, they don't care about you, the money is  the only thing with value to them.<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>The horrible place that I saw in my life. All the tenants call this complex LEAKY BUILDING. Because every time that the weather is raining you will see leaking  from the ceiling.  And when you call for service they come after two days and fix it  temporary and next time again leaking. The service is very poor.
We don't have any privacy they come to your apartment without any notice. Yesterday I was in the shower and they came to my apartment without any notice.
Different kind of bugs, spiders and scorpions are in home on the back hill you can find coyotes and snakes
Two times in a year somebody stole my stuff from the car.
Three times thieves stole my sons bike.
Several times I went to check mailbox and I saw nothing in and all the mailboxes was open.
Staffs are so impolite especially the manager Miss Melissa. she's very careless about tenant.
When somebody want to talk to manager she say always I'm busy and I can talk to you I will call back but she never called back anyone.
The first day that I was here to sign the lease they had nice smile and take care of us but after I signed they even know you who you are.
We sign lease and after finish my lease I will run away and never come back.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Avalon WH is a good place to live if you work in the area.
What is good: Nice location with stores like Ralphs and Target within walking distance.Amenities like a dedicated dog park,a basic but clean gym and two nice pools + jacuzzis with barbecue areas.Management in the leasing office is responsive and helpful

The bad:Theft from mailboxes and tresspasing by homeless people is on the rise.Dog owners dont pick after their pets business.Coyotes roam the hills on the back of the property.Lighting is sketchy in corridors and common areas.

The ugly: Smell of weed is all pervasive throughout this property. Internal walkways and aisles have people smoking/vaping.Shady people in the east pool area during afternoons and the east exit gate.

Updated review 3/25/2017
I am updating the review since a lot has changed since I posted.We have since moved out but the move out experience was great.
Also there is now round the clock 24hr security that checks on all areas.Haphazard Parking in the internal streets has stopped because the parking agent asks you to move.Mailboxes have new locks and cameras.Smoking smell/weed smells have almost dissappeared maybe because of the cameras and screening for residents.The back of the property is now fenced off.
Much better property now than when we moved in.< /Text><response>{'time': 1467040779856, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, Vishal!

. Unfortunately this Denist was recommended to me, omg I was shocked at the lack of cleanliness there. As there was even someone’s blood on one of the tools she was going use on me. Needless to say, I walked out without letting them work on me. Totally unacceptable practice, during these uncertain times we’re all trying to be safe and clean as possible. This Denist and her assistant extremely unprofessional before I walked out, she stopped what she was doing the Denist 3 different times to go answer the telephone not changing her gloves after doing so. If you’re looking for unsanitary conditions then this is the Dentist for you, if you’re looking for clean and professional this is absolutely not the Dentist for you.</review>

< Review>
I have been a satisfied patient of Dr Taitz for the last 6 years. She is very professional, always on time and has been very helpful with my financial position. Her office staff are very friendly and make me feel comfortable. I always trust her to do the best in my interests. I would highly recommend Dr Taitz and look forward to many more years of her excellent service</Review>

I have had a great experience coming with Dr. Taitz. Ive been with her since 2008 when I was only 6 years old. Now as a 19 year old college student I can confidently say that she is a great doctor that works wonderfully with kids and adults alike.< /Text>

<Review>Drm Taitz Orly has done a wonderful spectacular job with my permanent bridge and crowns. I had decaying teeth before. I got rid of bad breath after the removal  of my two teeth.  With the new bridge I look 20 years younger. Thank you Dr. Taitz<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I had really sensitive receding gums and Dr. Taitz suggested filling in the gaps. It really helped my pain when eating or anything touched my gum. No other dentist had really taken the time to notice why I had so much sensitivity. She was very patient and did a great job! I will be bringing my son and mother here also in the future.< /Text>

Dr. Only has helped me so much! Even when I had an emergency( tooth crumbled), she made arrangements for me to come in right away so she could fix it! It hurt really bad but she kept soothing me  saying that it would be out quite fast!

Even if there was a dentist that said that they are better,I  would never consider going another dentist,she is great! She is the only dentist who has been so kind to me!!!!!
If I was able to star her more I would give her a 10++++++!< /text>

Had a terrific first visit with Dr. Taitz this week. She is likable and great to work with. She even taught me new info about history and geography which was pleasantly surprising. :) We had a nice conversation and I also enjoyed chatting with and meeting her assistant. Would surely recommend Dr. Taitz to anyone looking for a new dentist!<//review>

Very unpleasant. Could not get my x-rays, said they do not do digital. Imagine that in 2016. Said their lab went out of business. So that is now my problem. So she said for $100.00 they can get my x-rays. My doctor in San Clemente said a full set of x-rays is $140.00. Hello, do you think they are making money here. Most doctors charge $25.00 for copies of your x-rays.
My cleaning was she said ultarsonic, which I thought was nothing more than a water pic. I was sprayed on my clothes, face, and equipment. Very unsanitary. My teeth were never polished as in a normal cleaning. But oh, she informed me I got this for free. Excuse me, I pay on top of my medical an additional $240.00 a year for dental, vision, and exercise. Nothing is for free, and if this is the service you say is FREE, than I will continue to go to my private dentist and pay out of pocket. Plus I have worked my entire life from 16-66. I have paid into the system like every other hard working person in the U.S. It is terrible how senior citizens are treated later in life. And yes Dr. someday you will be in the same position I am in. and NO i would not recommend your services. Unhappy Patient.<//text>

She is such a wonderful dentist. Aside from being extremely delightful, Dr Taitz is very meticulous in her work. I was reluctant to spend my own money (no insurance) at first because I didn't think it was going to cost so much. But after today I will never feel the slightest amount of regret because of how well my teeth look and more. Thank you Dr. Taitz!<//Text>

I haven't been to the dentist in 10 years, can you imagine? Fear and finances kept me from going. I am so so so pleased that my friend referred me to Appealing Dentistry. They are welcoming, friendly, sincere, affordable, and have helped me deal with my dental fears. They have earned my trust, and I will gladly refer my closest friends and family.<//Text>

I just finished working with Dr. Taitz and I am overjoyed with her work. I couldn' t afford much money, since I have no dental insurance and I'm on a fixed income. The first dentist ever to offer me 3 price levels, I opted for the lowest and I never expected such great work. For the price I paid, it is most definitely worth a lot more. She works quickly, with minimal waiting time.
She has a very friendly staff and a clean waiting area. Her two assistants, Lela and Jessica are very friendly and helpful. All needs are taken care of promptly.
I will recommend Dr. Taitz to all my friends. Thanks for all the great work!</review>

Our children had their first visit a few months ago. Simple 'no frills' office, wonderful customer service and peaceful atmosphere.  Loved it.  Both kids had a great experience.  The focus was truly on the dentistry and the customer rather than on non-essentials. We weren't talked into unnecessary treatments or add-ons. She even bonded their teeth at no charge!< /review>

<text>TERRIBLE!!! Preferential treatment to some patients! I had an appointment at 1p I arrived 10 mins early and was not seen by the dentist until 1:45p. They double booked and I could hear the dentist next door actually performing the cleaning,  but when she came into my room it took her a while to introduce herself and only did part of the cleaning and walked away half way through leaving me in the chair with blood in my mouth and when I asked if I could rinse, she answered rudely "JUST WAIT!" After 5 mins of waiting in the chair with blood in my mouth I decided to stand up and rinse my mouth. I've had teeth cleaning elsewhere where they were more thorough, but here the cleaning was possibly 5 minutes. And after the cleaning I asked the assistant if I could ask the Dentist some questions,  was asked to go to her at the front desk and I had to ask questions about my own X-rays because she failed to mention something until I asked more questions.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1557962202056, 'text': 'Eduardo,\nI am sorry you are not happy, however you had a full set of digital x-rays, full exam and treatment plan.

You were offered to have another appointment for cleaning together with a filling and gum treatment.

She will patiently tell your child anything they want to ask about any of her dentistry tools or equipment, and even let your child hold the tool a second, so they don't feel so frighten by they strange tools.  Reminded me of my own grandmother.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
My dental experience here was effortless and literally painless. I was referred from a friend who told me that Mrs. Taitz catered to dental babies. I called in the morning complaining of a bad tooth. I came in crying with a tooth ache around noon on a Thursday and by 3:30pm Mrs. Taitz and her assistant had me on my way home with a root canal and prescription for meds. Mrs. Taitz and her assistant took care of me from the start. Mrs Taitz and her assistant made me aware of what they were doing at every step. Great dental office</Review>

<Name>Melissa Fraser< /Name><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I lost my personal insurance blue shield plan when Obamacare came in to play.
Since then, I have had to have medi-cal.
On 6/12 a family member called her dental office​ on my behalf (I couldn't speak I was in that much pain.)  I had a very infected molar & was in a LOT of pain. I couldn't believe it when they said to come in right away even with medi-cal! That's a dentist that cares!  Since having medi-cal for myself and young twins, I have never gotten such a rapid response for Doctors. I was literally immediately taken back once I arrived and very promptly taken care of.  I am still recovering from going in a couple days ago, my tooth indeed was very bad. Also, Dr. Taitz gave me antibiotics but also knew that I'd need a stronger pain reliever and prescribed a few days worth of norco as well. I don't like to take medicine unless I really need it....but boy I sure needed it.
My point is, she was courteous (her and the very sweet lady that works with her) completely shocked me by taking me right then and with medi-cal; and writing prescriptions she knew I would need when I went home to heal.
I will return to her and refer her simply because of what she did for me. She didn't know me from Adam. She went above and beyond and located right down the street from my home.  In & out fast. I'm hoping my mouth finishes its' healing this weekend.
**Very grateful and thankful to this office**< /text>< userid>

<name>M S</name><gmapID>0x80dcebb0f57d2047:0x9e642a2ee5eed29c< /gmapID><resp>None</resp><Text>. Unfortunately this Denist was recommended to me, omg I was shocked at the lack of cleanliness there. As there was even someone’s blood on one of the tools she was going use on me. Needless to say, I walked out without letting them work on me. Totally unacceptable practice, during these uncertain times we’re all trying to be safe and clean as possible. This Denist and her assistant extremely unprofessional before I walked out, she stopped what she was doing the Denist 3 different times to go answer the telephone not changing her gloves after doing so. If you’re looking for unsanitary conditions then this is the Dentist for you, if you’re looking for clean and professional this is absolutely not the Dentist for you.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I had really sensitive receding gums and Dr. Taitz suggested filling in the gaps. It really helped my pain when eating or anything touched my gum. No other dentist had really taken the time to notice why I had so much sensitivity. She was very patient and did a great job! I will be bringing my son and mother here also in the future.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Very unpleasant. Could not get my x-rays, said they do not do digital. Imagine that in 2016. Said their lab went out of business. So that is now my problem. So she said for $100.00 they can get my x-rays. My doctor in San Clemente said a full set of x-rays is $140.00. Hello, do you think they are making money here. Most doctors charge $25.00 for copies of your x-rays.
My cleaning was she said ultarsonic, which I thought was nothing more than a water pic. I was sprayed on my clothes, face, and equipment. Very unsanitary. My teeth were never polished as in a normal cleaning. But oh, she informed me I got this for free. Excuse me, I pay on top of my medical an additional $240.00 a year for dental, vision, and exercise. Nothing is for free, and if this is the service you say is FREE, than I will continue to go to my private dentist and pay out of pocket. Plus I have worked my entire life from 16-66. I have paid into the system like every other hard working person in the U.S. It is terrible how senior citizens are treated later in life. And yes Dr. someday you will be in the same position I am in. and NO i would not recommend your services. Unhappy Patient.<//Review>< Pics>

She is such a wonderful dentist. Aside from being extremely delightful, Dr Taitz is very meticulous in her work. I was reluctant to spend my own money (no insurance) at first because I didn't think it was going to cost so much. But after today I will never feel the slightest amount of regret because of how well my teeth look and more. Thank you Dr. Taitz!<//review>

I haven't been to the dentist in 10 years, can you imagine? Fear and finances kept me from going. I am so so so pleased that my friend referred me to Appealing Dentistry. They are welcoming, friendly, sincere, affordable, and have helped me deal with my dental fears. They have earned my trust, and I will gladly refer my closest friends and family.</text>

I just finished working with Dr. Taitz and I am overjoyed with her work. I couldn' t afford much money, since I have no dental insurance and I'm on a fixed income. The first dentist ever to offer me 3 price levels, I opted for the lowest and I never expected such great work. For the price I paid, it is most definitely worth a lot more. She works quickly, with minimal waiting time.
She has a very friendly staff and a clean waiting area. Her two assistants, Lela and Jessica are very friendly and helpful. All needs are taken care of promptly.
I will recommend Dr. Taitz to all my friends. Thanks for all the great work!< /review>

<Review>Our children had their first visit a few months ago. Simple 'no frills' office, wonderful customer service and peaceful atmosphere.  Loved it.  Both kids had a great experience.  The focus was truly on the dentistry and the customer rather than on non-essentials. We weren't talked into unnecessary treatments or add-ons. She even bonded their teeth at no charge!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>TERRIBLE!!! Preferential treatment to some patients! I had an appointment at 1p I arrived 10 mins early and was not seen by the dentist until 1:45p. They double booked and I could hear the dentist next door actually performing the cleaning,  but when she came into my room it took her a while to introduce herself and only did part of the cleaning and walked away half way through leaving me in the chair with blood in my mouth and when I asked if I could rinse, she answered rudely "JUST WAIT!" After 5 mins of waiting in the chair with blood in my mouth I decided to stand up and rinse my mouth. I've had teeth cleaning elsewhere where they were more thorough, but here the cleaning was possibly 5 minutes. And after the cleaning I asked the assistant if I could ask the Dentist some questions,  was asked to go to her at the front desk and I had to ask questions about my own X-rays because she failed to mention something until I asked more questions.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dcebb0f57d2047:0x9e642a2ee5eed29c</gmapID><user_name>Eddie Charcas< /user_name>< Resp>

<review>Kind, gentle, caring dentist.  She caters to cowards!  She will explain everything step by step before beginning each procedurene.  She will patiently tell your child anything they want to ask about any of her dentistry tools or equipment, and even let your child hold the tool a second, so they don't feel so frighten by they strange tools.  Reminded me of my own grandmother.</review>< pics>

<Review>My dental experience here was effortless and literally painless. I was referred from a friend who told me that Mrs. Taitz catered to dental babies. I called in the morning complaining of a bad tooth. I came in crying with a tooth ache around noon on a Thursday and by 3:30pm Mrs. Taitz and her assistant had me on my way home with a root canal and prescription for meds. Mrs. Taitz and her assistant took care of me from the start. Mrs Taitz and her assistant made me aware of what they were doing at every step.

I lost my personal insurance blue shield plan when Obamacare came in to play.
Since then, I have had to have medi-cal.
On 6/12 a family member called her dental office​ on my behalf (I couldn't speak I was in that much pain.)  I had a very infected molar & was in a LOT of pain. I couldn't believe it when they said to come in right away even with medi-cal! That's a dentist that cares!  Since having medi-cal for myself and young twins, I have never gotten such a rapid response for Doctors. I was literally immediately taken back once I arrived and very promptly taken care of.  I am still recovering from going in a couple days ago, my tooth indeed was very bad. Also, Dr. Taitz gave me antibiotics but also knew that I'd need a stronger pain reliever and prescribed a few days worth of norco as well. I don't like to take medicine unless I really need it....but boy I sure needed it.
My point is, she was courteous (her and the very sweet lady that works with her) completely shocked me by taking me right then and with medi-cal; and writing prescriptions she knew I would need when I went home to heal.
I will return to her and refer her simply because of what she did for me. She didn't know me from Adam. She went above and beyond and located right down the street from my home.  In & out fast. I'm hoping my mouth finishes its' healing this weekend.
**Very grateful and thankful to this office**</Text>

Justin was able to find us the best deals possible! Make sure to ask for him when you get your insurance through Acceptance. They provide you with the best rates available. I definitely recommend! Pierre was also very helpful. If you can't make it in, give them a call. They are also extremely helpful on the phone and readily available to give you quotes! Choose Acceptance, you wont regret it!<//review>

Justin Leiva was friendly, knowledgeable and quick.  Took me less than ten minutes to delete my old vehicle, add my new vehicle, get better coverage at a better price and get my ID cards.  Really thought it was going to be a hassle, nope.  It was a quick and seamless transition. Thank you.< /text>

And while she couldn’t help me with the insurance quotes because she was still training, her level of customer service was amazing!

<text>I appreciate how acceptance insurance insured me at a decent rate when no one else would. Some companies wanted hundreds of dollars to insure me which acceptance was able to do it for less than half the cost. I also had a great agent that was always there to help me get the best rate possible.</text>< Rating>

<text>My experience was incredibly great here. I am a college student who was in need of a job and received an offer from a family friend to be a delivery driver. I needed to have my name under a policy in order to receive the job. My broker provided me an amazing rate which I could manage while going to school full time and working part time. Thank You Acceptance insurance !</text><name>Adrian Vega< /name></record></dataset><record>

Justin Leiva saves me 100$ I say with insurances for awhile so saving 100$ a month is a great deal for me. He goes the extra mile to make sure I was satisfied. Highly recommend Justin Leiva so ask for him 5/5< /Text>

Acceptance Insurance never disappoints in the insurance battle in finding me the best rate possible especially with the relentless efforts Victor demonstrates as one of the arms of artillery.  I will definitely recommend and be returning to sit back and know the best rate possible will be the result for me at the end of my visit.< /Review>

I decided to switch from Allstate to Acceptance because I wasn't getting the best service for the price at Allstate. When I walked into Acceptance off Briggsmore Ave. in Modesto, I was greeted immediately and sat down to discuss what I was looking for. I could tell from the start that the representative genuinely wanted to get me a plan that fit my budget, wants, and needs. He asked deeper questions to customize a package that suited me, and got me a price that was less than half of my Allstate bill. Excellent customer service, the down payment was inexpensive, and very professional from start to finish. Ask for Tawer, he was the best!<//Review>

<Text>Both Justin and Sal are super friendly and excessively helpful. I only go out my way to do reviews for those who deserve it, and go out their way for their customers. I feel the pricing is reasonable and worth it, i definitely enjoyed the experience.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I've been having trouble getting insured with a rate i can afford because of my driving record so i gave Acceptance a shot.  Tawer Michael ran my record and he got me a quick policy that i can afford.  He did the best he could and i am happy with what i got. Very quick, Professional and Excellent Customer Service.

Thank You.</Review>

<Review>I’ve never felt so welcomed in my whole life! I was greeted in a timely manner and once tawer sat me down and explained the benefits of his insurance I knew I had come to the right place. It feels good to know that there’s still great people out there who would go above and beyond to help.< /Review></record>

I needed help finding a cheaper policy and went in to this office. I was greeted by a pleasant young man right away. He took his time shopping around different places and came up with a great rate for my husband and I. I recommend this place to anyone and  ask for tawer, he definitely will shop for the best price for you.</text>

As soon as my husband and I walked through the door we were welcomed with a smile! We have been searching for an insurance company that had reasonable quotes with great coverage for awhile and we're glad we were able to find that with Acceptnace Auto Insurance. Thank you Justin and Tawer for helping us get the best coverage with the best prices for our vehicles! I definitely recommend to anyone looking for auto insurance and needing a great price to check Acceptance Auto Insurance out!</Text>

This is the worst car insurance agency to go through. Be careful they do illegal stuff that can get you in trouble. If you barely get your license they will automatically put in the system that you had your license in Mexico for 3 years just so you can get a lower rate. I know from experience. They will do it without your consent or even knowing also they won't tell you until you have issues and you find out yourself.<//Review>

This place really hit the spot! I was looking for something healthy in Burbank and this place popped up. Don’t the let the sketchy-looking/lack of pics fool you, this place is really great!
Very fresh ingredients and greens! The wheat Ciabatta was awesome! I got a huge hearty sandwich and side salad all for only $11! Love the thick-cut turkey in my sandwich. I’ll definitely be coming back here to try their other sandwiches and salads! They’ve got green juices too.
Metered street parking right outside. Walked in at 2pm on a weekday, no line.< /review>

This is one of my new favorite finds unbelievable sandwiches I have yet to try the Chinese chicken salad but I look forward to try different things on their menu. The turkey sandwich is off the chain the tuna salad is an acquired taste I got a tuna salad with the salad it was unbelievable but I'm not a big fan of tarragon. But the salad was so unbelievable it still tasted very delicious.< /Text>

I love this place, they genuinely give me happiness. I have been ordering from HealthyCA once or twice a week for over a year and their food is absolutely wonderful. Their standards of quality, freshness and portions is consistent and prices are very reasonable. The salads are huge, packed with nutrition and love.
I have tried all the sandwiches and salads and they are all so good. My favorite salads are: the salmon salad (add asparagus) with lemon olive oil dressing, the Southwestern salad with chipotle dressing, the albacore salad with lime cilantro, as well as the california spa salad, quinoa and wild rice sides.
The owners and staff are friendly yet efficient and professional. I will continue to keep coming back here because I like how I feel after eating their food, full and nourished. Thanks HealthyCA!</Review>

This place is incredible, Chinese chicken salad so good I had to come back two nights in a row for it. Can’t wait to try the rest of the menu. I have looked for easy healthy food near me for so long, I can’t believe it took me this long to discover this place.</review>

Can we say welcome flavor town, reasonable prices, great customer service?   I haven't visited this spot in a few years.  They used to deliver to my place of employment all the time so I've had the luxury of having tried them before and coming back they still don't disappoint!  Hearty and fulfilling meals that are worth the price you pay.  They make all their own sauces, desserts, drinks, and food.  It's so worth spending for quality.  I just wish they had more seating!</Review>

I got the Albacore tuna on homemade ciabatta wheat bread and picked quinoa salad for a side.  It was delicious, very fresh and healthy! If you love healthy food you will love this place! Very quick as well!< /review>< pics>

I love this place. They're very accommodating when it comes to catering. I've order for my daughter's water polo team and everybody liked the sandwiches. Their vegan menu is actually yummy. They deliver to nearby parks for easy picnics. Whether I ask my lunch in a ciabatta or in a wrap it is always tasty. The new Sicilian is my favorite.<//text>

I love the New Sicilian on Wheat with green salad is my go to sandwich. I try to be around this area around lunch time so I can get it. Best and healthiest chicken sandwich I've ever had. It has grilled chicken, roasted onions & tomatoes, garlic aioli on a wheat bread. Mmmmmmm!<//text>

It was awesome and quick! Granted we needed a place, but the decision was aided by the catalyst, the leasing associate (mainly), the apartment being what we were looking for, the amenities, and the cleanliness of the complex and office.</Review>

< review>
I would not recommend this place.  All is good until it’s time to renew your lease.  That’s when they get you.  They don’t let you renew at the Market rate of the apartment.  For example if the market rate right now for your specific apartment unit is $2000, i.e that’s what a new person coming in will pay.  That’s the quote the new person will get.  However the current resident, will pay around $2200 to renew the lease for that same apartment unit (they charge you an approx 10% premium above the market rate to renew each year).  I found this very unfair, and when I asked them about it, they said, well you will have to pay that much in moving costs if you go somewhere else, so you might as well stay here.  Such a ridiculous answer by the manager Jennifer!  Other apartment complexes do not do this.</review>
<resp>{'time': 1589493450320, 'text': "We are very sorry to hear that you feel this way. Renewal rates are often influenced by factors that include availability and market trends, and we're currently offering flexible lease renewal options to help residents weather the crisis. We'd certainly like to connect with you to discuss further but we could not match your comments with that of a recent resident experience. Please contact our office directly when you have an opportunity. Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you."}<//resp>< Date>

<text>I love living here. The office and maintenance are extremely kind, friendly and accommodating to all of us. The pool is like a 5 star hotel. My daughter and grandaughter recently came to visit from the east coast ( first time seeing my apartment) and loved staying here. We hiked in the canyon, right next to the complex and are 20 minutes from the beach and downtown San Diego. There is a great diversity of cultures, and all ages live here. It’s a happy home.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1565710348815, 'text': "Hi Jane! It's great to hear that you're enjoying your time here.

<text>The grounds keepers are always out working and keeping grass and bushes trimmed. Not a lot of trash seen around so they do great with that too. Love this place.

The leasing office staff is the main reason why I’m staying here for another year. They are extremely kind, caring and always find a way to help. Best leasing staff I've had experienced. They all deserve huge thanks!

I tell everyone I meet, this is the best apartment complex I’ve lived in. The staff is incredible. They are all kind, responsive, helpful and always there when I need them. This includes the maintenance crew and the office staff.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Knowledgable, friendly Leasing agents and maintenance staff. Our unit was clean from the ceiling to the floor. Virtually dust free and air filters were new. All appliances worked and we were able to put in a work order for stainless steel appliances for a low cost added per monthly bill. Hard wood floors and plush white carpet were cleaned professionally by maintenance staff. Outside has a resort like feel, most greenery I have seen on a apartment premises in the surrounding area. Fitness gym is spacious, pool is clean and even smelled the chlorine passing by. Great tennis and volleyball courts/sand field. The staff here will get you off to a great start living here and will hear all your needs and concerns are met.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1531411268515, 'text': "Hi Sean!

Montierra is an apartment community you want to live at long term. They are super pet friendly and absolutely loves dogs. My dog, "The Dude", loves to visit the office and get special treats. There is a sense of community at Montierra Apartments. Feels like home versus just another apartment complex.</Review>

Just moved in and absolutely love this place. It is quiet and feels so safe. I can appreciate the size of these apartments, coming from a 2 story house. It feels cozy. The natural light from the skylight window gives me life every morning!!!🤗🤗🤗 Overall great place. Looking forward for summertime so we can enjoy the pool!!</Text>

Montierra,
Nice apartments. VERY NICE PEOPLE!!!!! EVERYONE OF THEM IS POLITE AND HELPFUL. Sometimes they are so busy they forget to do stuff, so you have to rattle their chains a little bit every now and again, but, all in all, they're good sports. Tad expensive but nice apartments in good location. I give them a B+ but they could get an A.</review>

The service was on time. They were always helpful and courteous. As always all good must come to an end! My time at Montierra was up. I'd definitely recommend.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

Twenty minutes from almost anywhere in San Diego to include downtown, the beach, the airport, hiking trails, etc. The amenities are hard to beat for the price you pay and the living area is very nice. Overall 5 stars, and that is well earned. I have moved 13 times in 4 years and I have to say this place is my favorite.< /Text>< Pics>

I just love living here. My favorite part is how responsive and friendly the maintenance staff is whenever I have a request. Just today I ran into Marvin Mejia who was in the middle of preparing the apartment next door for a new resident. He took the time to stop and talk with me about my maintenance concerns (a leaky faucet I just discovered) and get it scheduled for maintenance at a convenient time while I am away traveling.<//Review>

Montierra must mean paradise in Spanish, this place has double master bedrooms, beautiful canyon views and, giant palm trees to make you feel you are on a tropical island while floating in the open year round  pool. The staff is always friendly, the maintenance men are fast and efficient.  Neki at the front desk seems to always have a smile and delightful banter for all walks of life that comes through.</Text>

< review>
Montierra is one of the best place we've ever been. We have had moved for a couple of times looking for the best place. and we finally found one. Very quite and safe area. Beautiful and well maintain environment. We've only been here for 2 years but we have the best time especially my children. My son loves to play at the basketball court. My daughter loves the pool and tennis. They have everything here, volleyball court, tennis, jaccuzzi, very nice pool, patio, beautiful and well maintain club house to rent for parties   and of course a nice gym (my favorite). Also nice people at the office, Ryan, Jennifer and Neki (not sure how to spell her name) but all of them are very helpful. They have the best maintenance on the premises as well. This is the best place! If ever we move to a house I will miss this place forever. thank you Montierra!</review>

don't waste your money! they have horrible customer service, you have to put work orders in 3 times before they finally do it, over priced, when your lease ends be ready for a high renewal rate, after you move out and ask for call back or help forget it they treat your horrible! don't move in you will regret it i lived at equity properties before in other states have been awesome but this property is horrible! they don't post location correctly they are in mira mesa area, google it!< /Review>

<review>We had an issue with our front door lock and Marvin Mejia showed up promptly, was very friendly and fixed the lock right away.  Maintenance staff here is great!  Thank you so much for the quick service!

Edit: We discovered another issue with our kitchen sink's faucet and Marvin came right back and fixed it also very efficiently!

6/15 - Unfortunately I'm having to lower my rating due to some issues with the leasing office.  When we moved out we were told that they replace the carpet every 5 years, and since we had been there longer than 5 years, instead of charging us for carpet cleaning, there would be no cleaning cost since it's being replaced anyway.  On the last invoice, we still got charged for carpet cleaning, when we tried to contact them to resolve this they are now ignoring our calls but they keep sending us the bill.  I was satisfied with the community and the customer service up until this point, but I don't think I'll be recommending them now.<//review></record></dataset><record>

You will pay full price for cleaning, paint, and carpet cleaning regardless of what your pre-move out inspection tells you. Even if the cleaning log says they only wiped down the appliances and small marks on the wall (normal wear and tear per the pre-move out inspector).
Cleaning $118
Paint $26
Carpet $125

If you are looking at apartment 8028 be prepared to be threatened by your new lovely downstairs neighbors who also threatened the police one day and I saw him get thrown to the ground and restrained (that was the day I stopped thinking his threats and his wife's yelling were empty).

Goodluck. Another piece of advice, don't live on the second floor no matter how small your dog is (my dog weighs < 30lbs but my neighbors were constantly banging on the ceiling when him or I walked around and we go to bed at 9:30pm, not later).<//review>

<Review>I came here because they advertise it having a Dolby theater, AKA great sound quality.  Unfortunately, something was really off when I came today.   It sounded like they recorded the film at a windy beach!< /Review></record>

<Review>Nobody talks about projection. Every screening room I've been in here the projection is at about 20%- 50% luminance. My guess, the projector bulbs haven't been replaced in years because it's expensive, and well, most people don't even know. I've written multiple emails to amc about this and nothing has changed. When I went to see Parasite I could barely read the subtitles because the projector was so dim. This is really unacceptable, and of we're going to be paying a premium to go out and see a movie, theaters should care about image quality above all else. I hope they fix this before theaters reopen.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>For those who aren’t fans of wide cinema and being seated next to loud strangers, there’s a movie house in this area that could be good for you. There’s nothing like a private, air-conditioned room with comfy couches to keep you settled. They also have a private KTV perfect for housing your group of rowdy friends.< /Review>< Pictures>

This is a small theater but it's very clean and comfortable. The screening rooms feel like... screening rooms ...because the idea of crowding gobs of people into the place has given way to comfortable reclining seats and giant cup holders. Better than the screening rooms at Warner Brothers! When I booked my ticket and chose my seat with Atom tix, I couldn't really tell which end was the screen so I accidentally booked a seat in the rear. Yet, the room was small enough that it didn't matter too much. 20 minutes of previews was 8 minutes too long tho.< /text>

<time>1580971468362<//time><text>So I haven't been to this AMC in probably the last 10 years, maybe more actually. It tends to get overshadowed by the giagantic AMC 16 across the way but let me tell you, this is a hidden gem. It tends to play the same popular titles but the theaters are much smaller (like 30 seats or less smaller) so every seat gets a great view of the screen and they all have the upgraded recliner chairs. The whole experience feels more private, more comfy. If that's what you like, try this one out otherwise the AMC 16 will satisfy your gigantic screen, gigantic sound itch much better.<//text>< userid>

<text>One of many AMC theaters I have visited around USA. Comfortable seating, excellent quality of screen and immersive sound that will definitely make you enjoy every movie you wish to see. In every AMC there is option to buy popcorn and refilling soda.
With AMC stubs you get free refill of large popcorn, free upgrade to large drink and 3 movies each week. That is definitely good deal. I would highly recommend this to anyone loving new movies for great price.<//text>< pics>

It wasnt too crowded so the ticketing and shop were very efficient and there weren't lines too long or had to wait much for anything other than the regular 20 minutes of coming attractions that all cinemas have these days. The location is perfect, that area in Burbank is beautiful and I recommend to arrive early or stay late just to walk around and have lunch or dinner and enjoy the weather, nice scenery outside the mall it is located in. Is a small mall but has enough to entertain yourself for a couple of hours. It gets even better if you have the A-list stub hubs app subscription because you a kid the ticketing and enjoy the rewards and discounts.</Review>< Pictures>

A step above most small mall theaters! Of course the theaters are smaller; seating maybe only around 50 - 100 people BUT they didnt scrimp on screen size,sound quality,or amenities! Most of the theaters have big comfy power reclining seats! The lack of actual people manning the box office (because of kiosks) and at the concession stand (because of the size of the theater) does make it feel a little deserted BUT at the same time, when you're  sitting in the theater,it feels like your at friends home theater so it's kind of comfortable. When it comes to theaters I'm all about the bigger-the-better but these theaters are perfect for the non-action, been-out-for-couple-of-weeks, type of movies.</Review>

Very small theaters here.  The theater spaces "inside-a-shopping-mall" was never originally designed to accommodate big theaters, but they managed to squeeze some entertainment venues in here to help meet the demand.  If a person in the theater stand up in the wrong place, it casts their shadow across the screen for everybody.  However, if everyone inside is considerate & mindful of that issue,  you don't experience it as a problem during the actual movie that you've come to see.  (At least in the theaters we've been in) there is comfortable, recliner-seating at regular prices to help make up for the other big-screen features lacking at this particular in-mall location.<//Review>

This is the best place to watch a movie. The seats recline, the staff is friendly and professional and the fact that you can select your seats and pay online is such a marvelous feature.  I am so glad that I have the Stubs Premier card because I earn points, get VIP access to buy snacks and discounts.  The only place I watch movies is at the AMC 8 in the Burbank Mall.</Review>

Great theater that's larger than it seems. They just remodeled and completely moved on to touchscreen kiosks for buying tickets at the theater. A thing to note is that all the theaters are smaller so tickets sell quickly.</text>

Leather recliners, armrest go up to cuddle or stay down if the stranger next to you doesn't give consent to cuddle. There is classic movie theater over priced food like chicken and waffles and booze.  Plus it's in a mall! A mall!  This isn't just a night at the movies, it's a one stop shop for all your daily needs. I don't think you should leave.  4 stars it probably better than a Best Western or Ramada Inn.<//review>

This is my second time going to this movie theater to watch the last movie 10:15pm but today Something scary happend last night 01/26/2019. My niece and I went to the restroom and there was a creepy  guy standing right in front of the bathroom entrance and he was looking at us through the mirrors while we were in the restroom, he wasn’t waiting to anyone because we were the only people in the restroom and he was trying to get something from the pocket or he was doing something else and then he left right away when he saw some people coming to the bathroom. Please at least one security should be there until there is no one in the movie theater, I really like to go to this movie theater but after this I don’t feel safe to go in the nights.</Text>

<review>I grew up visiting AMC theatres in Burbank, California. Since the mid 1980's, AMC has offered entertainment at a reasonable price and has never skimped on a clean and inviting movie experience. The ultra luxurious and comfortable recliners made my latest experience even more worthwhile and fun. I no longer live in Burbank, but when I am in the area, I will be at rhe local AMC watching a beloved movie.<//review><Date>1548838305211<//Date><UserId.>110426743051504073130</UserId.>< gmapID>

<Text>Nothing to complain about this place, really. It has everything you might want if you want to watch a chill movie:

1.) Parking spots (PLENTY)
2.) Reclining seats
3.) Small theater (If you don't appreciate huge crowds)
4.) Self serve kiosks.
5.) Lots of dining places outside the theater.

They don't have IMAX or Dolby though, but that's why it's beside AMC 16. I still think this is the go to place for movies not IMAX or Dolby worthy.</Text></record>

There are 3 AMCs in downtown Burbank; this is the smallest. It's situated on the top floor of the Media Center mall itself and tends to have both mainstream and some art house movies. The theatres are smaller than the AMC 16 in the next block south, but comfortable, and there are often smaller  crowds for otherwise hard to see movies.
It's a good little theatre. You can use the mall parking, which is always available, but more so after hours, when only the theatre is open.<//review>

I do like this theater. Free parking and every seat is a recliner! Great comfort, but it also means seating may be limited in some of the smaller theaters. Good to grab tickets ahead online as the small theaters sell out quickly.<//Text>

The totally remodeled the theater.  Every seats are now electric recliner.  The screen are also bigger and nicer.  It gives you a very intimate feeling especially the smaller room.  The staffs here are friendly and helpful for the most part.

The concession stand could use a little cleaning up throughout the day.  Every-time we have been here, it’s usually a mess.  The trash is always full for some reason.

Since they redid the theater.  You can reserve and choose your seats.  I don’t have to rush to the theater.  I buy my ticket online and skip the whole line.  Speaking of the box office.  There are 3 new big touch screen self service kiosks with 1 customers service station/box office.

Parking is located in the mall on the 4th floor of the parking structure.  We never have any issue with finding parking.  I much preferred going here than the older AMC 16 down the street with the rundown seats, horrible parking, and long concessions line.<//Text>

My only gripe is the lack of hot water in the Women's bathroom. Other than that, theater screening 1 was fine. There are recliner seats which are not 100% comfortable for my short frame, but they are more comfortable than the old seats still found in most of the theater screening rooms in the nearby AMC Burbank 16.< /Text>

It's a nice place. Sometimes it is too crowded. Movie theatre is cool and up- to-date. Although there are no laying chairs for laid down watching. The prices are not cheap but affordable.</text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>It was a quiet mid-afternoon day in which I wanted to treat my parents to a movie and refreshments, which ended up being a disappointment. I doubt that I'll return to this AMC. I recently had knee surgery, so I can't go up the stairs,  but I had to since the handicap lift was out of order.  Second,  when we went to buy refreshments the only drinks available were orange juice and water. Finally, the temperature was in the high 80s and the AC wasn't turned on. I  think that those of us who enjoy going to the movies in the middle of the week should have the same services available as those given to those who enjoy the movies on the weekends.  Especially when you consider the amount of money we pay to watch movies in real 3D.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I went to watch the Avengers Endgame last night. The projectionist decided to start the movie 20 minutes late. Had to find manager to restart the movie. Then after sitting through 3 hours of the theater that has no AC btw. They weren't playing the extented cut as advertised. It was the regular movie. For that kind of money to see a show they should at least have AC & a projectionist that shows up to flip a switch.</Text>

There are 3 AMC theaters in Burbank. This one is inside the mall on the 3rd floor. Very clean and well maintained.

There are fewer theaters and smaller theaters too. Love the recliner seats!

Parking structure is right next to the mall (free).<//text>

Mom loves butter on her popcorn, but neither machine worked. I told the clerk and she just smiled and said ok. I asked when it would work and she shrugged.

I had not been back to this movie theater since they updated their seating and sound quality. It's definitely a considerable upgrade. If you haven't been to this one in a bit, give it a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised.<//text>

Extra point for showing a lot of indie films.

Amended- So it looks like they read my comments. My ticket is checked about 95% now and everything is updated. Most comfortable seats by far. Worth checking out. Love the automated kiosks.< /Text>< Rate>

Very small and over priced theater that didn't seem clean.  I guess the main feature of this theater is that there are comfy seats that can also recline, but does't justify a $16 movie ticket. Also - this theater apparently has a "VIP" line to buy snacks and popcorn, which means you can cut anybody who has been waiting in the regular line. I was unaware of this and some guy got upset that I bought a drink before him when he was standing in the VIP line.<//Text>

Smaller theater but just as great! Has reclining seats and a small bar if you like spending too much money but that’s what the movies are for right? Free parking since it’s a mall<//Text>

I went to the IMAX and it was a great experience. You are able to buy an alcoholic beverage, if you're 21+, and bring it inside the theater with you. Great picture! Amazing sound!</review>

<review>I love how AMC has been changing with the times to keep the theater going experience alive. This is my 2nd favorite movie theater to go to aft AMC City Walk, but the sound system is better here. Price are good and it's still in the mall, which reminds me of going to the movies as a kid. We also saw The Force Awakens here.<//review><date>1500710448917<//date></record></dataset><record>

Cleaner than the AMC 16 across the street but the theaters are much smaller and don't offer stadium seating so your view of the screen can get blocked. They do have the AMC signature recliners but you still feel like you are watching a movie in someone's garage. The other plus is they show the smaller independent films here that the AMC 16 doesn't.</review>

I haven't been to the one inside the Burbank Mall yet but between this one and the one near the BWW, this one is better. They have the reclining seats and it's a smaller theater which I found to be less crowded. The only downside is no phone service.<//Review>

Great theater.  I love that there are 3 AMC's within a block.  That pretty much guarantees that you'll be able to see every big movie that comes out without walking far.  Plenty of great places to eat around here as well.<//review>

I was very surprised at the quality of this little theater. We were in theater 8. Despite being small, it was very high quality. My two complaints would be rows one and two are too close to actually take the movie in. Second, the right speaker was feet away from the wall and cast a decent sized shadow on the screen. How that's ok is beyond me.

As a side note, be prepared for mall types. There were two kids about 6-8 years old sitting next to me that had zero care for the fact there was a theater full of people. Parents? None I guess. Most of the theater was telling them to be quiet by the end.

Seats recline almost completely, so this could also work for someone looking to take a nap.< /Text>

<Text>The popcorn didn’t taste “fresh.” One thing I liked was that the theater has reclining seats, that was great. Popcorn and drinks are bit expensive, XL (their standard drink option) is over $6. Parking is difficult to find especially on the weekends and during holiday seasons. They are in need of a renovation.<//Text>< pics>

It’s a small theater inside the mall but with comfortable seats. Parking is free and there’s plenty to do cause it’s the mall. Only thing lacking is more ticket kiosks.<//review>

I was disappointed with this visit to this AMC theater.  I spent $40.98 for two tickets to see Spider Man in 3D and was disappointed with the 3D effect.  Also the concession needs improvement regarding the pop corn was lukewarm at best. This will be my last time coming to this theater.< /Text>

This place has everything, old Navy, forever 21, AMC theatre, food court, PF Chang, shoe stores up the wazoo, kids playgrounds, those electric ride zebras, bed bath and beyond, Burlington coat, nail salons ice cream shops, candy, cookie shops and a big Macy's that is so posh and regal, you'll feel like you are shopping back in the 60s (cause of the building, not the fashion)
Highly recommend it, will shop here again and again.< /Text>

Small (cinema) screens with reserved reclining seats. 3 stars is stingy (I come here every month or 2), but 4 would be generous. Good place for a dbl feature if you like Haagen Daz (next door) & have a half hour between movies [can't bring outside food in]. I don't like the food options within the shopping ctr (not the cinema's fault but, if I did like 'em, I'd give it 4 stars)< /review>

<Review>Small, older theatre, some rooms have good sound and seating, others not so much. Inside the mall though so that's convenient. Also near the Burbank 16 theatre so if you can't find a showing there, its a quick walk to find another showing.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>After the remodel of this theater, I can say this is the theater to go to.  All chairs are fully automated, as if you're sitting in a comfy leather barcalounger at home.  They play movies that might be more limited release so getting access to those is always a plus.  Highly recommended theater.< /review><username>Sandra Waring< /username>< gmap_id>

<Text>I was a bit hesitant going to this movie theater.  I had seen it in the news awhile back and presented it as more likely to be a kitschy place.  My mind was already made up when I arrived at this place, which was I didn't like it already.   The kiosk were very big, the information you need to buy was clear, a bit confusing on the time showing and the time that either tickeys stops selling for a particular movie or when the showing starts.  The size of the self serve kiosks is also helpful if you're on a wheelchair.  The price for tickets are pricey for Burbank,  but read throughout  my whole experience and it's reasonably so.  There is a bar and a regular food concession.  The bar is not made to hang around till youre drunk but it's like a service similar to the Euro train.  Serice of the staff at the concession was super fasts, efficient, and it's a bit pricey, but it make sense...I needed to use the bathroom and they have a reasonable  size  bathroom, clean a d seems to be bigger for the theater's size.  So the movie theater  was small, but spacoous for people, not loke the cramped space on most theaters, the seats are red leather...and very aoft and comfortable like butter...and my gosh the seats recline, and it was an experience that was exceptional.  For the price of food and drinks and the tickets, it is worrh the place.  I will be watching more movies at this place from now on.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Tiny theater nestled inside the Burbank mall. It's not busy due to the AMC 16 that's walking distance away but, it's also not updated or any cheaper considering.

They're usually playing some of current movies, as well as some more obscure cinema. It's a place you'd go if you're trying to watch a movie nearing the end of its run or, maybe a movie you're trying to bring younger children to.

The seating is pretty limited and, the seats themselves don't rock, recline, or do much in the way of comfort.

The snack bar is also dated. No where near the choices the larger nearby theater has.

All in all its... Okay.</text>

I would like to give this theater a rating that explains my experience but there wasn't much of one... I tried calling the theater and the phone rings and is never picked up. I've tried calling 4 times now and nothing. No other customer support outlets that I can find. Strange...< /Review>

Small theaters but cozy. Would not watch a big budget flick here on opening weekend if you want all the FX bells and whistles.</review>

This theater was my old stomping ground when I was a kid me and my dad would always come by here before the new amc was built. This theaters pretty nice because its next to the foodcourt. Other than this theater is convenient its but its not a big place but overall it did its job. I remember seeing the movie Bruce All Mighty here as a kid those were the days. And the other day I swinged by here at this mall I noticed that the theater being remodeled! More upgrades yet to come!< /review>

<Rate>2</Rate><text>Bad. Didn’t advertise no soda even though other AMCs in walking distance. Low incline theaters mean everyone in the back crosses in front of the projector. Confusing seating numbers leading to multiple people being sat wrong, leading to an attendant coming in during the movie to sort it out. Another customer was allowed to come in with a large personal bag, which if your the paranoid type is an obvious security problem. Won’t go back.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
For the cost of seats and the area in which it’s located they should have reckoned seats like the website states it has.  So disappointed with the info on the site.  Maybe you should add which amc theaters have reclined seats and which don’t instead of staying yes, they have state of the art reclined seating.< /Review>
