<Review>This is my new favorite place. My mother and I came for her birthday. Both got full sets and I got a pedicure. Everyone was very kind, professional, and courteous. I adore my nails. I've gotten so many compliments and it's only been a day. Valerie is amazing and very talented!! I came with a picture for reference and what she accomplished blew me away. The entire staff is amazing. Looking forward to my next appointment (have already booked 2 in advance.) Thank you so much.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I love coming here to get my gel nails completed. I had these done yesterday and they lasted me all night long with no chipping! I informed Rose that my nails tend to chip really easily because of how rough I am on them and my line of work. She took extra steps to prime and prep the nail so chipping would not occur.  I'm not a fan of red, but Rose picked this red color out for me and it's gorgeous! I also had my nails done by Vera and she did a great job as well! If you need your nails done, I highly recommend coming here! I have gotten so many compliments on my nails.< /text>

<review>By far one of my favorite nail spot! It's a hidden gem hiding in this area which I admire. I called a few hours earlier to see if there was any spots available for the same day and made an appt at 5pm. Came in on time and got seated few minutes after. I got a shorter coffin/tapered square shape which is $40 plus holographic for an additional $25. Prices are reasonable and the ladies here put in their work!<//review><Time>1558858669282</Time>< gmap_id>

<Review>First time customer today and Kim did an amazing job!! My original nail artist for my wedding bailed on me last minute with my wedding coming up in just a few days. I took the chance on this place, relying heavily on reviews so I know how important these reviews are. I showed a pic of what I wanted and I am beyond impressed! Kim paid every attention to detail and made my nails look so elegant for my big day! I am so thankful. ❤ Defintely going back!</Review>< Rate>

<Name>Crystal D</Name><Date>1533343553055<//Date><Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Went in for a French pedi. No  Appointment but the wait  minimal, less than 10 minutes.  I was a little put off when I entered, because the entry was tiny small and not as cleanly as I would have liked.  I contemplated going elsewhere, but the reviews I read before going were so good, I thought I'd give it a try.
Everyone from the receptionist to all of the manicurists were so incredibly nice and I was comforted to see that the mani pedi address were clean and hygienic.
Angie did my pedi and she was AMAZING.  She was so in tune to what I needed as her client. She asked me how I liked my water and adjusted the temperature as needed.  The entire pedicures was very enjoyable. I felt no picks or pokes as she sloughed away the dead skin from my feet and meticulously shaped each nail. Her foot/leg massage was the BEST. It was worth the cost just for the message alone.
French pedi came out perfect.  Angie was efficient with her time and mine. Needless to say, I will be back.
Thx Angie!</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCNy0dDWuupNO8pdhoGZWTr7ZhvO5mj9kvexG1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS8o3yBqVQJAjcrhqIHErvH_QbMoENQyrywwbP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTfe7JG0ykKB684svOdGFGFsDxNcCdrBT8mUer=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1533347661023, 'text': 'Thank you Crystal appreciate the opportunity and glad you liked the service.'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809442aa788aa3c1:0x6a853a34082841d6<//gmap_id></record>

Staff was friendly. They did a fantastic job on my gel. Will definitely go back. They prefer cash but they accept card.

About a week later my nails began to bubble up and chip.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I went in without an appointment during a time that is typically busy for them, but was helped immediately! Tan, the owner, greeted me when I walked in and sat me down with Valerie. They were very involved in the design I was wanting and incredibly attentive. I always tend to talk too much with my technician, but neither she nor the owner seemed to mind. They made me feel very comfortable as they were all fun to talk with. Will definitely be making this my go-to spot. Valerie is fantastic!< /review>< Pictures>

I have never been so happy with my how my nails turned out!! Rose is a phenomenal artist! I showed her a picture I got from Pinterest and she created it with no hesitation!! I am so blown away with the fantastic experience I had here. I wish I could fly from Denver every couple of weeks just to come back here!!

I was in Fresno from out of town for work & really needed a pedicure. I was a walk-in, but they were able to take me right away which was great. They have a huge selection of colors & super comfy, brand new massage chairs (the chair was great). The pedicure itself was not spectacular but more than adequate and the young lady was very sweet. Overall a good experience with Heavenly Nails & Spa.<//Text>

Absolutely the worst experience I’ve ever had. Male employee rushed the girl doing my pedicure to tend to a lady who needed a fill. He then was supposed to take over but left me in the chair for over ten min while he did other things. The had the nerve to try and charge me the full price! Don’t come to this location save your money! It’s extremely tiny and smells inside upon walking in. Wish i new this before hand. Way over priced as well!< /text>

<review>Kim is an excellent business proprietor. Her girls do a really good job and they are conscientious of the amount of time it takes in order to get your services done. Continually amazed at the cleanliness of the shop. They bag their feet basins between each customer you can tell that they change instruments for each customer the bathroom is even most of the time 100% clean. Their employees are very friendly and knowledgeable and always willing to try and get two operators to do your services like if you do your hands and your toes they almost always accommodate you by giving you to do your hands and someone get your toes.

The atmosphere between the employees is a friendly atmosphere and you can tell that these girls really like working with each other.

A clean environment prompt courteous service, additionally good prices quality supplies. Good selection of gel polishes with matching polishes that are not gel.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1516331719699, 'text': 'Hi Lori, thank you for giving us the opportunity to service your nails and we do our best to make our clients comfortable along with good professional services.

Walked in and took the first available nail tech for a gel manicure and a pedicure. Thanh was wonderful-very thorough, didn't rush through or get sloppy. She did a great job on my nails. They have a great selection of colors. I have found my new nail salon!< /Text>

<Text>The customer service here was okay... I would most definitely recommend to book an appointment.

I arrived as a walk-in and I had to wait about an hour and a half to get attended. Yet, this was not the issue.

I had two ladies, one who did my pedi and another who did my manicure. My issue is with the massage you are paying for that is part of the service. They spent no more than 5 minutes, put a dot of lotion, and barely massage. It was the weakest massage I have ever received! Plus, the young lady who did my manicure left the polish near my cuticles and the polish is now lifting and pealing off (mind you I went there a week ago).

I would recommend to go to Polish'D Nail Bar. There they charge $40 for a gel pedi that includes the basics + candle wax to remove dead skin. With Heavenly Nail Spa that is not included and it is $40.< /Text>< pics>

After being a regular here for about 2 years, I’ve stopped going.  The girls do good work, and I really liked them.  However the owner began consistently overbooking, and 3 times in a row, I waited between 45 minutes to an hour and a half one time, even though I had appointments.  The last time I got there, and he said it would be a few minute wait.  I was upfront, and told him I wasn’t going to wait if it was a long wait. He said no, only 10 minutes.  Then just as before it turned out to be 45 minutes.  I had also brought my elderly mom , and after they finally took me, she still waited another 20 minutes!  That is not okay when you’ve booked appointments.  Won’t return.
Previous review:
Decided to go to Heavenly spontaneously one day when I was in the area, and saw they had good reviews.  I had an AMAZING experience, having Amy and Tia give me a gel mani/pedi.  They did a great job, and Tia gave me the best and longest leg and foot massage I’ve ever experienced!!  I will definitely return to Heavenly Nails.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I used to love getting my manicures and pedicures at this salon. However, recently the owner seems to be focused on getting clients in and out as quickly as possible and thus the service and quality has been lacking. Today, a friend and I had appointments for 10:00 pedicures. From the beginning we were rushed. There wasn’t time for enjoying the foot soak, the massage chair, or even the foot/leg massage. I even had to ask for my heels to get scrubbed enough to remove the rough skin. From start to finish the whole pedicure was done in 20 minutes. Both of the manicurists were kind and did a sufficient job, but they made it clear from the beginning that the owner had told them to hurry due to a large party coming in. I won’t be back.</text>

< review>
I have been going here for a few years and the service from the girls that work there could range anywhere from excellent to a downright waste of time and money. I consistently saw Amy who was amazing then Susie who was just as good. They both left. The last three times I have been there they have played television and movies with Mature content on the very large tv.  During an explicit sex scene on Sex and the City, I asked the girl doing my nails (Valerie) to change what was on the television because women have their children in the salon. She laughed and told me that the kids weren’t watching it anyways. When it ended, one of the other technicians (Rose) suggested watching Fifty Shades of Grey. I quickly explained that there are children in the salon and I would appreciate it if they chose something PG- which they did. One of the newer nail technicians loudly and continuously used foul language “F* this and F* that” and “noooo F*ing way”. Needles to say, I go to a salon for a peaceful, relaxing and professional experience and this salon has turned into anything but that. I certainly will never take my daughters back either. Unnecessary and unfortunate : / My recommendation: Find a salon that has a little more class and professionalism.</review>

<Review>Not worth my money. There was a cat just roaming back and forth in the place. The lady didn't wash her hands when she touched the cat and clients hands. It was the quickest pedicure ever with no real scrubbing. It was basic cut, 2 second scrubbing, polish and that was it. I wasted my money on this place. you couldn't even tell I got a pedi.< /Review>< userid>

Had a great experience today with susi. She did such a great job on my pedi and I really loved it. This will definitely be my new fave place to go even though it's a 30 min drive< /Text>

<user_name>Christine Saviez< /user_name><Time>1509337113336</Time><rating>5< /rating><Review>The only place in Fresno I will have my nails done. I've been searching for the past 2 years to find a descent nail salon and Heavenly is it! I walked in just by chance and was so happy to find a salon where the nail technician listened to my concerns and preferences. She had a very nice easy going personality and was very professional and thorough. The entire salon was clean and everyone was friendly.  I only wish I had showed up on the day a cat was present. I am an animal rights activist and seeing a cat while having my nails were being done would have made my week!  I read a previous Google reviewer by Pa Vang.  Vang  expressed anger and paranoia over a cat. Vang's assertions were absolutely ridiculous and shows that she hasn't even looked at the scientific evidence. Cats DO NOT carry germs that could be infectious to humans. I'm also an Ivy League graduate and have researched all forms of potential health risks with cats towards humans. And there are ZERO diseases  that can be transmitted by just holding a cat. Pa Vang is obviously giving an animal phobic opinion from her own unfounded and unscientific imagination. Furthermore, nail technicians handle alcohol several times daily making their hands more sterile then yours or mine.  Put it this way, an average person hugging their spouse and then shaking hands at a business meeting is more likely to transmit an infection than a nail technician picking up her cat. So yes, Heavenly, does excellent quality work, they have a friendly atmosphere, and they are animal friendly.  They have shown a kind hearted disposition to animals. I support businesses that show love to animals. Heavenly is the only nail salon that will receive my dollars. Other businesses should follow Heavenly's lead and show love to our companion animals.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The environment is nice & busy. Techs are nice. Quailty and Customer service not so good. In less than a week I had 5 nails break. 5! Im a SAHM that does not do heavy labor at the most loading the dishwasher. I went in for 3 repairs 2 days apart and when i asked them to replace the full set that i spent $45 on the best they could do was give $8 off of a $33 full set. I shouldve have to pay for a set that lasted me less than 2 days before the 1st nail broke. So disappointed. Will never return.

Update: a total of 7 now smh! An apology is not gonna give me a new set of nails.</Review>

<Text>Martha took her time and did a wonderful job on my pedi today. They even took their time on my 6 year old  niece. I've been to shops where kids mani&pedi from start to finish were done in 15 minutes. It's hard to find a nail shop that actually put in effort and focus on the customer they are working on at the moment instead of rushing to get on to the next customer waiting. I am a manicurist myself and these are the people that I would love to work with and wouldn't hesitate to hire if I owned a shop. Very clean shop too.Thank you Martha, vera and anna.<//Text>< rate>

My van had its check engine light come on in May of 2020. I took it to T&M to have them look at it. They stated they would check the code, and get back to me as soon as they could. They had a high number of cars to work on, so I understood it might take a while to get to my van.

Come July, and I had not heard from them yet, so I called to see what is going on, and they said they would call me back. Still nothing for a while, and I was getting worried. It is now September, and still nothing. October comes, and I get a hold of them, and they tell me a needed a new engine.

This was ridiculous because I had just put a new engine in my van through T&M just over a year ago, and it should have been under warranty. Eventually, I called them again saying that I just put in an engine with them, and it should still be under warranty. I talked to the owner, Jorge Fajardo, about it, and he agreed to not charge for the engine since it was warranty, though later he stated that the warranty was expired, but still did not charge me since they were the last ones to put in the engine previously.

So, they go to "work" on the engine, and come November, they were going to get a new engine again because the one they ordered "did not work." My car was "finished" in December, and I finally took it home. Jorge said he would mail me the paperwork for the work, though I never did receive it.

At the advice of my father, I took my van over to my friend who is a retired mechanic to do a couple of checks on it. When he looked at it, he discovered that the engine in my car was the original one I put in with T&M over a year ago, and he stated they did not do a single thing to my car, as some of the codes that were an issue originally when I put it in to T&M were still popping up. My mechanic friend fixed the parts of the car that caused the codes to pop up, and still had to do some addition maintenance after the fact. Currently, it is running pretty well, thanks to my mechanic friend, and not T&M Automotive.

I am very disappointed in T&M Automotive. My van sat in their shop for almost 1/2 of a year, and they did nothing to repair my car, but were wanting to charge me for a new engine that my car did not need. That is probably why I never received the paperwork on the repair; because they did nothing to fix the van.

T&M in the past were great with their repairs and maintenance, and at a very efficient rate and time. Now, I cannot in good conscience recommend them to anyone after this experience. I feel as though they were trying to get a quick buck from me by saying I needed a new engine, despite the fact that they put one in recently for me, and when I said that I would not be paying for a new engine I thought was still under warranty, they stringed me along until they said they "Fixed my van" when nothing was done.

I stand by this statement: Do not go to T&M Automotive.< /Text>

<review>I had my air conditioning compressor replaced by an ac shop in LA only to be told my new replacement compressor was also leaking.  George and his staff at T&M found out that the actual leak was in the line.  Saving me the cost of purchasing another compressor. They have fixed other issues in my car including a recent break line problem (no oem or aftermarket parts available) even though the parts had to be custom built by them. They have been nothing but kind, courteous and timely.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Hi Everyone
Wanted to let everyone know that this shop is one of the best in Lancaster. My car broke down on me and I had my car towed to this shop yesterday. It was the end of the day and I knew that I needed my car fixed for tomorrow. Jorge and his crew made it possible for my car to be working and running top notch. I couldn't believe that my car came out better than before and I will always take my car to them, Thanks T&M Automotive for your excellent service and reasonable prices.<//text><rating>5<//rating><Date>1474499898757< /Date>< Name>

Spent 100 dollars just to have them inspect one thing.  They did not tell me there was a charge to look at the car. And I need other things inspected on my car, but I'm not willing to pay another 100 dollars for each thing to be checked. Rediculous price. I feel totally cheated out of my money.<//Text>

I contacted T & M Automotive to have my brakes done on my F-150. I called them based on their reviews and testimonials and they lived up to their rating 110%. Customer service and expedience went well above my expectations. The total price was very reasonable and they didn't mislead in any fashion. They certainly have a repeat customer here. It's nice to know that you can actually trust a mechanic in the area.

I brought in my overheating truck and after almost 2 weeks I got a diagnosis. I ended up not fixing it because of the cost (which is a reasonable quote, just not in my budget). I appreciated the effort they put into finding the problem considering how long it took. Everyone was kind and took the time to explain things. I do wish they communicated a little more about time because I didn't hear from them for almost a full week until I called. I don't mind waiting because I know the issue was complex and thankfully I was not limited to just that car, but some initiative on their part to communicate would be nice. That's my only suggestion though.<//text>

Horrible awful I do not recommend called this shop ahead of time to tell them I need a new altanator get there and George says my alternator fine suggest spark plugs instead I do that and less then 5 days later my car completely shuts off while I’m driving my kids to school ! Luckily we were not injured called AAA just for them to show me (I have pics as proof ) the altanator was indeed bad called George and he wanted to charge me an additional cost plus what I had to pay to tow the car smh ! Do not come here if you want to live the place is cheap and not honest do not recommend< /Text>

I had almost given up on my beloved truck just because I thought I couldn't afford to repair it. I have used Jorge from T & M Automotive quite a few times in the past 10 years or so. I was soo happy to find out they were still in business. I had my truck towed over there yesterday afternoon and as soon as I got there, although Jorge was away on business, Jason immediately started looking at my truck.  Within a few minutes this master mechanic was able to diagnose a bad fuel pump.  He was able to replace my fuel pump with a new life-time warranty pump the same day. I highly recommend T&M to anyone looking for an honest mechanic. Thanks guys! I'll be back next time I have any problems with my truck!<//Review>

AMAZING! I just moved here from Tennessee so finding a new car guy was something I was a bit worried about. Unfortunate for me, I had a coolant leak and had no idea where to go or what to do. I went here and they looked it over right then and there, consulted me before ordering or doing any actual work on my car, gave my boyfriend and I a ride home AND picked us up the next morning when our car was fixed without us asking and for free of charge. Everything was priced accordingly and was affordable! Jorge is a very friendly and personable man. They were super honest about everything! They made it very easy for my boyfriend and myself to say that we found our new car place!!</Text>

Dr. Zimmerman is the best! My mom referred me to him and I referred my husband! We all think that dr. Zimmerman is the best dermatologist in the area, he is so knowledgeable, honest, straightforward, to the point kind of doctor. He’s very respectful of his and his patients time. I’m very happy that he is my family’s dermatologist. I highly trust his judgment.< /review>

I've seen Dr. Zimmerman in this office twice and both times the office was running on schedule - or at least less than 15 minutes behind schedule, which is good enough for me. I usually call ahead to make sure I don't show up for appointments and then sit in a waiting room for an hour, but some places have front desk staff that just refuse to admit the doctor is 30 minutes behind! Not here.

The waiting room is clean and nice and had little samples of sensitive skin Dove soap available last time I went in.

The BEST thing about this office is being able to email to request an appointment. I went to their website, explained what I wanted checked out, and had an email response the next day when I was at work. I didn't have to take a personal call at their convenience, but was able to request a date and respond to their emails when I had a break - totally convenient! The appointment wasn't that far out either.

You don't have to have skin issues to need a visit to a dermatologist. They do cancer screenings, which is important for everyone! My cousin died of melanoma last year and he was only in his 30s, so naturally I'm concerned about every spot I see - it's nice to be reassured that I'm just being paranoid.  Never ever wait to check out something on your body that concerns you. They also offer cosmetic treatments, facials, and skin products of all types, so hopefully my next visit will be for one of these services.</review>

Couldn't even get an answer on the phone. Tried calling several times but each time it said I was number 2 in line and that I had a 1 minute wait time, then it said I was number 1 in line and would be next when the next representative was available. Nope. Both times, after a full 10 minutes of waiting and having to listen to a non-stop loop of ads the answering machine came up and told me to leave a message and try again later. I know the representative was just on the phone with somebody, so twice they did this to me. Seems like for all the advertising they do they could afford better customer service.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Highly recommend Golden Key Locksmith for any needs regarding keys and/or locks. They are affordable, efficient, friendly, fast, and honest. I lost my car key and needed a replacement key made. Their technician David was out to the house in an hour or so and was quickly able to create and program a new key for me. When losing a key or changing locks, if you want to make sure the work is done right, give them a call (and ask for David).< /text>< Pictures>

Great service, David showed up on time to help with our jammed front door lock.  He took it apart piece by piece to analyze it first.  I thought we needed to replace the entire lock, but David quickly solved for what the actual problem was.  He also had the extra spare part handy in this car, which he got to replace it with.  After he fixed it, the front door knob works great as it doesn't jam anymore when trying to open it.  Thanks for the help and fast response :)<//Review>

<review>I call Golden Key Locksmith because I needed a new fob key. I was not planning to go to the dealership because of time and cost. So I decided to browse online for a service that will come to my location and will perform the job fast. So I call David and He programed my fob key in les than 20 minutes. GKL ended my headache fast and their service was affordable. If you are looking for affordability, reliability, quality and convenience please call Golden Key Locksmith.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
If you’re looking for someone with a good attitude and prompt customer service your search ends here. For my C-class family out there my ESL failed in the locked position at 69K. When the ESL fails in the locked position it can no longer correlate with the EIS and the car refuses to start. Rebuilding the ESL would’ve taken 2-3 weeks to receive components; not to mention it would only be a matter of time before the China components failed again. Quickest most feasible solution was an ELV aka emulator which completely replaces and mimics the ELS. Sean not only carries the emulator on hand but can program them as well; he’s quite familiar with this quandary. Once I touched down with him he got me squared away first thing next day within 20 minutes and even programmed a spare key in between the process for half the cost the stealership charges. No adverse effects since everything was installed/programmed. Definitely can vouch for Sean and will most certainly will be doing Business again in the future.</Review>

(Review based on the one on Imperial)My experience was fantastic! The server was nice, the place was clean and the food was delicious. I came here with my wife after a while of wrenching at ecology wrecking yard. I looked them up on Yelp and saw Sopapillas! I've heard of them but never had one. I came here and had my very first Pork and green chili sopapilla! Loved it! My wife got the Beef and red sauce sopapilla. The meat had good flavor, the dough was nice n soft. My wife didn't eat half, I ended up eating it at home later that evening and maan, still taste good! I almost forgot.. not sure if it's a side salad or extra topping for the sopapilla but it was pretty darn good.. it has a cream on it with a kick! Maybe mixed with a little chilie but that alone was tasty. Cant wait to try the sweet sopapillas.< /Review>

Great little eatery. All of their food is excellent. Highly recommend their chicken salad sandwich that has a nice kick due to the jalapenos! (They will make it without the peppers if you wish.) Their enchiladas are delicious. And their famous sopapilla desserts are to die for. (Note that they are huge and super sweet, so plan on sharing!!!)< /text>

I helped out the owner when she came into my work and she gave me a free appetizer coupon, so my wife and I went. I've never had new Mexican food before. But it was amazing!! Hands down the best food I've eaten. Highly recommend this place. I can't wait to go back!!<//text>

If you love New Mexican green chilis in your food, this is the place. Friendly staff and delicious food in a casual and comfortable environment. Great prices for large portions and daily specials that are also quite large portions.<//Text>

I stopped by for a quick take out breakfast burrito.  I was pleasantly greeted and decided to eat in.  In the morning they serve you a fresh, hot sopapilla, with honey at the table, yum!    I really like that they offer whole black beans as an alternative to pinto; a healthier choice for me.  All food made fresh to order.  They have fresh hot sauces of varying degrees and taste, including green tomatillo.  Service is friendly and inviting.  Decor is simple and casual.  Comfortable seating for one, two, groups, etc.   Clean, tidy, and open floor plan.  For breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Some selections of beer and wine. Happy hour 3-6pm, Monday thru Friday.  They also offer catering and full pot take out of Menudo.  I would cerainly recommend this place.</review>

Love the food but the service intermittently sucks. Depends on time of day, I think. Went at 8:30 pm - they close at 9. Not friendly at all. Just wanted to get rid of me and go home, I guess?  But the food was still good. And I've been here several times and got great servce, hence the 4-stars. 'll try going earlier next time....see what happens.</Review>

Checked that place on my way back from Santa Fe Spring's junkyard. Affordable, simple, tasty, fresh "new mexican" food. Friendly crew was a bonus. Too bad this neighborhood joint is going away as the owners are loosing the lease. We need more of those!< /Review>

Food quality is hit and miss.  You never know when you're going to get a good meal.  Too bad, because when it's good, it's worth going back.  How do you know which day will be a good day?  Consistency matters.</Review>

Not bad. Like a hybrid of a fast food joint and sit-down place. You get a little basket of chips and a small container of salsa if you dine in. The service is kind of slow if it's busy (lunch time) because there's usually only one waitress, but everyone is very nice and the food comes out quickly.
The portions are large for what you'll pay and the food tastes decent. It's a quaint little lunch spot near work that we go to one/twice per month.<//text>

Great tasty Mexican food, reasonably priced, large portions. The sopapillas are awesome & filling. Even have taco Tuesday. The one in La Habra has breakfast. You should eat here!</review>

<Text>It's closest to New Mexico food without having to cook it myself. Green chili with potatoes sopapillas reminds me of my great grandma's cooking. Staff is always friendly and very attentive.< /Text><user_name>Ladi VDT< /user_name>< pics>

The chicken and steak were very moist and I am going to go back soon and try other things. I don't know what to try 2nd though as the whole menu sounds good. Staff was very friendly to.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Love this place. My family is from New Mexico and this is almost the only place around to get pretty authentic New Mexico cuisine, so we go as a family for anniversaries and stuff. The prices are good, about $8-12 a plate. This is not traditional Mexican food or Tex-Mex, it's pretty New Mexico specific, which means it smacks of Mexican food but with a spin, lots of fried dough and dishes centered around red and green chiles. If you've never had New Mexican food, definitely get the stuffed sopapilla, which is the classic, and get it smothered.  It's fried dough stuffed with beans and green or red chile and meat, topped in red or green chile, cream and cheese.  ALWAYS get an order of plain sopapillas with honey for dessert.  The green chile soup is actually fantastic too and the New Mexico style enchilada stack with an egg on top is prob my second choice as far as main dishes.  If you're New Mexican, of course, this won't live up to the real deal, mainly that the spice levels are way toned down for Californians, but you can usually get it still spicy enough to enjoy it.  The service is unfortunately almost always pretty nonattentive, but it's a really great casual, inexpensive place to go as a family with really tasty food< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>If you are from New Mexico or are familiar with NM Hatch chili’s this is a “must stop”... I didn’t grow up in NM, but my dad did (Los Lunas) and we made a trip out there every September to get our years worth of NM Hatch green chili’s. We’d roast them on the bbq, bag and freeze them and have chili all year long. Well for those of you who do not want to go through all that trouble, there’s The Green Chili restaurant to satisfy your NM Hatch green chili cravings. Their food brings me back to when I was a kid watching my grandma cook and enjoying all the great food she made. I’m actually glad I don’t live too close to the restaurant, because I’d eat there everyday, I’m not kidding it’s that good... I really hope you take the time to stop by and get the green chili stuffed sopapilla, it’s amazing. Enjoy!!! 😀</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Awesome food and service. The green chile is bomb and the sopapillas delicious. The enchilada stack was also good and the hamburger very yummy. Kid friendly and they eat free on Mondays. $2 taco Tuesday and complementary plain sopapillas in the weekend until 11am l. I'll definitely will be coming back.<//Text>

Food here is great, the burgers are fresh beef and cooked to order. Everything is seasoned very well, their green chile sauce is amazing. If you love Chile Verde you need to try theirs either as a plate or an oder of Green Chile Verde fries, the pork is tender and the frys are cheesy and perfectly seasoned.

They even has a green chile ranch!

The staff is also super friendly and their store accepts mobile ordering on different platforms.<//Text>

< review>
First time here. I had a wet shredded beef burrito in green chile. It wasn't the greatest tasting burrito. The beef flavor was bland. It needed more seasoning. The beans tasted like they were out of the can. My wife orderedd carne asada tacos. They scimmped on the meat. It to was bland. No taste. The michelada was to tomatoeee. Over all the the guy who served us was good .the food got to us quick. Service was good but that's all I can say. Not sure if I'll be back.<//review>

<text>Drove 20 miles to have a chili rellano for lunch with sopapillas for dessert. Discovered that they don't have rellenos anymore so I ordered 2 beef taquitos. They were OK.

The sopapillas were way too thick and weren't puffy enough to pour honey into them. Lacked any real taste. Double disappointment!!

<rate>5</rate><Text>Half of my family is from Albuquerque, NM, and I love green chile. I have to beg people to bring me Hatch green chile when I run out (which is always a few months after chile season).

Last night, my boyfriend and I had a half order of green chile cheese fries with the pork green chile and the stuffed sopapilla with ground beef, green chile, and potatoes, with Christmas on top (half red/half green). Everything was so good! The green chile sauce was a little different than what I'm used to, but every family has their own recipe. And this recipe is flavorful! The pork was tender, and the ground beef green chile with potatoes reminded me of everything I love about New Mexican food.

We will be back and recommending this place!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Making food twice for the cost of one hurts nobody But me.  You lost 15 min of time I lost food cost labor cost and then a bad review which in turn loses us new guests.

This mechanic shop is the Best! Arturo(owner) and his staff are amazing 🤩 they are on top of things and know what they’re performing on your vehicle. I’m very satisfied with the work they have done to my car, they’ve worked on my Honda accord and now on my Nissan Altima, I’m happy with their work!

This shop is affordable and if it’s something you may not afford at the moment Arturo will explain what is urgent to take care of and what can wait for later. I highly recommend this mechanic shop to anyone. I’ve recommended  this to family and friends and they are very satisfied as well😀

Thank you Arturo and staff!<//text>

I've been coming to this shop for over 8 years. Arturo has helped me with the alignments on all my cars. I recently asked if he could install a lift kit on my truck & he said he could, I really can't say enough good things. The install went smoothly, the pricing was reasonable & I'm beyond satisfied. I highly recommend this shop!</Text>

Arturo is straight forward and explains what he needs to do and why he needs to do it.  I appreciate a communicative mechanic.  Definitely coming back.< /text>

When I left my car was still unaligned. They never even did the alignment just drove my car around the block about 5 times. Never will I come back to this place.</review><GmapID>0x80dd36aecc0bbf2b:0xf64ff7c40778ddba</GmapID></record>

Went for a alignment, had me waiting more than 2 hours, Looked like they eyeballed the alignment(Didn’t have proper equipment), didn’t get a print out of my cars alignment and tried to overcharge me</text>

Honest review from and honest person. For starts I would like to shout out Arturo (owner)  For being genuine and honest. I usually handle all repairs when it comes to my baby(01 Mazda Miata) save some money and I do not TRUST Auto repair shops (shady mechanics). Let me tell you this shop is far from that. With my work schedule and severity of the issue (blown rear caliper) I had no time to fix myself. Out of all the shops surrounding my work place this was the one I stumbled into (glad I did). From the start I was attended to in a timely and very professional matter. I expressed to Arturo that I was dropping the car off during work hours (11am) and would need it before my shift is over (5pm) As I am not local to the area. Arturo assured me he would service my vehicle and have it ready by then. Sure enough my car was ready at 3pm. Replaced rotors and pads all around including two rear caliper replacements and brake system flush. Very reasonable priced and top notch Work. Definitely worth giving Arturo a chance.</review>

This shop is amazing! They took car of me today (day before new year's eve), charged me close to nothing, and did it in half the time everyone else told me. They do not disappoint - clearly the customer comes first for this business!< /text>

<Text>Very knowledgeable staff. We were referred to Long Beach Alignment & Auto Repair, by another local business. A good sign, in itself. We now service all our family cars with Long Beach Alignment & Auto Repair. I can send my wife by herself to them, and not worry about work to be done, or pricing. A great place.</Text>< name>

The best mechanics are found here.  They're not just trying to make a buck. I had issues with my Altima and took it to the dealer 3 times and they couldn't fix the problem. Each time being around $300. Brought it here and got it fixed for $90. I've brought my Jeep here and I was told what was wrong with it, and they told me that the vehicle should still be covered through factory warranty. If you need a mechanic, I've been coming here nearly 10 years. I highly recommend this place.</review>

<Text>Good service, friendlly and accesable staff. And very good prices. After shopig around this place has the best prices and value. And they don't rip u off. They break down what you need and seem to be upfront about everything. I would reccomend. Downside: cash ONLY and it's hard to talk over the phone since they rarelly answer.<//Text>< Rating>

Specifically the perspectives from business owners who are trying to grow their business as well as the teachings from Armando. Everyone who is starting their business & don't know where to start must go here for direction. Those who have already established a successful business would also benefit from going to Get in Motion because there is valuable networking! Many businesses come together to the mixers & seminars & collaborate with each other. I encourage every to come.</text>< Pics>

<text>Armando is very approachable, sensitive to beginners and made me feel welcome on the first meeting. I would give 5 stars, but I'm still in the process of learning more. However, I'm sure I'll rate 5 stars sometime in the near future, so keep an eye out for my review as I learn more.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Get in Motion! has been an outstanding partner for our organization. As a small business advocacy organization, Small Business Majority works diligently to focus on underserved small business owners and entrepreneurs. We conduct educational workshops and have resources available for small business owners and entrepreneurs interested in policy issues that impact them and their businesses. In order to do this work, we rely heavily on our Strategic Partners and local business organizations. As the Southern California Outreach Manager & National Hispanic Outreach Manager I strive to build relationships with organizations who can collaborate with us to put together educational events and we have partnered with Get in Motion on various events including in person and online webinars on a wide array of topics. This has included workshops on Access to Capital & Retirement as well as Healthcare. Needless to say, because we are also focused on the underserved population of small business owners, we also strive to provide our educational resources to monolingual/bilingual Latino business owners. Reaching this target audience is pivotal as they account for a growing number in our population and are starting businesses at a rapid rate. Armando has been instrumental in offering his leadership and platform for us to share our messages with the Latino Community in Coachella. Keep up the great work!< /Text><Time>1514923145304<//Time>< rating>

After another year of paperwork and processes, today I have my Corporation and my contractor's license with the state of California. I already have my website and even my accountant. I am ready to take the commercial jobs that I have always wanted. Today, the vision of my business is completely different. I GO WITH EVERYTHING!

I have never actually seen anyone at this facility however I am still writing this review based solely on the customer service I receive while attempting to make an appointment. I called on 4 separate occasions attempting to schedule an appointment and was rushed rudely off the phone with promises to be contacted the following day to schedule one which I never was. I found this very unprofessional and chose not to get a service done there solely because of the rude, disrespectful and rushed tone as well as the blatant dishonesty in an attempt to appease me for the moment. As I have stated I cannot speak to the actual talent  of lack there of because I was not given the opportunity to be given more than a phone call. SMH......I hope this is read and address by management but if that is the professionalism given over the phone NUMEROUS times I can only imagine how I would I would be treated at an appt. -Tati< /Text>

I've been looking for a great place to get my eyelashes done for the first time and I finally decided to go with this place and wow I may say my eyelashes looked flawless! I had so many comments on how they actually looked like my real lashes, and its affordable. Highly suggest you come see these ladies.< /review>

Eyelash extensions -- girl, if you've been contemplating about getting it, just do it! Eyebrow Queen Salon did a wonderful job for my lashes! It was my first time ever getting them and now I'm questioning why I haven't gotten these earlier! It is affordable and the quality is GREAT! I will definitely be coming back for a touch up! Thanks Eyebrow Queen Salon for making my first eyelash extensions experience so wonderful!<//Review>

Best place to get your eyebrows threaded. They take there time and you leave with a great shaped eyebrow.</text>

I finally found an affordable and fast place to get my eyebrows threaded! I've been looking for a place like this since I went to a similar place in Brooklyn. It's somewhat of a hole in the wall, but it's fast and cheap and the people are friendly and do a great job shaping eyebrows.</Text>

They always leave my eyebrows looking great! It last so much longer than when I waxed them! You have to be careful who you pick though, i had a bad experience once with one them and NEVER again! Now i just avoid her lol But i did have to try all of them to see which I liked the best.< /review>

The ladies are amazing & are fast expanding their business. It gets crowded quick. If u need eyelash extensions, waxing (other than eyebrows), henna tatooing, facials--u need to make an appointment! Call well ahead of time--appts book fast!< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The truth is I am a bit disappointed because I went to do an eyelash extension and they charged me a very expensive price that was $ 100 and not even the week when they started
To fall and I had all the care I loved but they were not very good quality I called to see if there was a guarantee on the work and the woman ignored everything I told her and preferred to hang up on me and not accept that I had gone to that place that I would win With discrediting them and they lose more than I do for $ 100 they lose one more customer than when they desia you classify $ 80 for 3 weeks and I charge $ dial it for the first time

(Original)
La verdad estoy un poco desilusionada porque fui a hacer una extensión de pestañas y me cobraron un precio muy caro que fueron $100 y ni la semana cuando empesaron
A caerse y tube todos los cuidados me encantaron pero no fueron muy buena calidad llamé para ver si había garantía sobre el trabajo y la mujer ignoró todo lo que yo le dije y prefirió colgarme y no aceptar que yo había ido a ese lugar que ganaría yo con desprestigiarlos y más pierden ellos que yo por $100 ellos pierden un aclienta mas aa que cuando ai desia clasicas $80 por 3 semnas y ami me cobro $ disque ser por primera vez<//review>< pics>

The location has seafood and they Ave combo specials and have so much!! Even smoothies and there is a such a good selection. I will deff be coming back here. It’s a take out store so be ready to bring your food home and eat there but they have crazy specials when I came they had 3 breasts for $ 5.49.
I will be back soon.
Their food is delish and the people are quick with your order.
There’s not much interaction so it’s kinda hard to tell about customer service. But they are friendly that’s why the 4⭐️
3👍🏼’s outta 3👍🏼’s. It’s a go guys!! Check em out!!<//text>

Second home is Cajun County New Orleans, and the spices added to the batter of this chicken, well, let me say "YIPPEE COWABUNGA I must be home"! Also, the Sweet Potato pie is truly a salivary flashback to Southern pastry taste at it's finest. 🎖</text>

Towards the end of eating our son breaks into one & finds a brillo wire inside. My husband showed them the batter covered wire & they wouldn't reimburse him, but they gave us 2 chinese meals. Once at home i warm it up only to find the rice tasting burnt. The broccoli had a whiteish color to it. Returning the whole thing right now. Going to start going to the one on lake ave. Lets see how they are. Sorry, after all these years. Maybe the heat is to blame. Can't believe the food was not good.< /review><UserId.>116414383775830423445<//UserId.>< date>

It's okay, but it's expensive and charge even for ice, probably because it's in a bad area where people always looking for a freer alternative. I would  watch the cooks I don't trust Asians cooking country food<//review>

<Text>I love this place. Like LOVE.

The food I’ve gotten here has always been very flavorful, well cooked, and presented beautifully. They also have a good selection of wine as well if you want to drink wine. Their desserts are also delicious, I always order the doughnuts which come with a dark chocolate sauce and this white sauce.

They used to have these fish cannolis that were heavenly but unfortunately, those aren’t on the menu anymore.

Outdoor seating: yes
Heat lamps: yes
Nice owners and staff: yes
Price: it’s on the pricier side
Wine price: ~ $11-16 per glass< /Text><user_id>107823875515866738594</user_id><user_name>Flora Zambakari</user_name>< Rating>

<review>Bellanico was a nice sit-down restaurant with a great feel, ambiance, and experience.

I stumbled upon this place on a recommendation and went with a few people.  We noticed there was a prefix menu for the night.. so that was a good way to try many of their offerings!

Our first dish we got was toast with cured salmon paste on it.  The toast was crispy and had a nice texture to it.  The paste was a good accompaniment and it was a nice dish to munch on.  We then were able to try the wild boar and ricotta ravioli.  I liked the ravioli though it was a pretty plain dish and did not think anything much of it.

I was also able to get the Russet potato gnocchi with gargonzola cream and toasted almonds.  This was my favorite dish here.  The almonds provide a nice texture and the gnocchi was prepared well and tasted great.

For dessert I got the goat cheese cheesecake.  This was a nice tasting cheesecake and it was not overly sweet.  It just had the right amount of minimal sweetness which I liked.

I really like the interior of this restaurant and the service was very attentive and nice.  I definitely would come back!<//review>< rating>

I do believe this is the one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  The first time I went I had the swordfish.  It was the most perfectly cooked fish I have ever had.  It was served with mussels, cauliflower, capers and some other deliciousness.  This time I got the duck.  It was cooked as such that it almost had the consistency of ham.  Delicious.  The service here is excellent.  The wait staff are knowledgeable, extremely nice, and accommodating.  The price point is great for the quality.  For a restaurant experience where you can be sure all the staff, chefs, to waiters, and management care to deliver a quality experience.   Dining at its finest.</Text>

Cute, classy, and cozy restaurant with good variety on their menu. Also a bunch of Italian wines I've never heard of, but taste great. Service and food were great; would recommend. We didn't need a reservation on a Wednesday night, but that could be due to ppl staying in.</Review>

Fantastic experience.  Easy to get in, fast, friendly service, excellent cioppino - which was the only thing we had (one was big enough for two).  The place is small as most have mentioned, I kept getting bumped as I sat at the bar, but for me that adds to the ambiance and reminded me of being back in NYC at a old school diner.  So really, for me, not really a place to sit and linger as you sip on your after meal coffee, but more of a joint were you grab some great food and move on.</Text>

While sitting at the bar, you can see in the kitchen where your food is prepared. It's a clean space, employees seem genuinely happy to be working there and they're quite knowledgeable. Ordered the smoked trout pannini. Seasoned to perfection and oh so delicious. The negroni went along with it just fine.<//Review>< Response>

The Bellanico website is updated for the pandemic and quite clear and user friendly, including easy access to current menus, times of operation, etc.  Calling in to order was simple and did so just a couple of hours before pickup, and it was indeed ready on time.  I was told the person taking the phone order was gracious; very nice and friendly</review>

It's rare to visit a restaurant that brings back such wonderful food memories from my childhood. In the bay area, Bellanico is that place. Every visit is a culinary and aesthetic pleasure. Friendly, attentive service, delicious entrees and side plates, impeccable presentation.</Review>

Delicious, delicious, delicious. This place is pricy but worth every penny. On a budget, my date and I were able to order three appetizers and two mini pasta dishes for under $60. Order smart and enjoy the food.< /review>

It's our default spot for a good Italian meal outside of the house. I love that they always have a vegetarian prix fixe menu with pairings that's unique and I can stand to learn something new about the cuisine. We used to hold off for anniversaries and such but now just bring our kid and buy her a decent dinner. It's a great dining experience at a fair price point.</Review>

We visited for the first time for restaurant week and I was very disappointed. The service was very slow, the food was good but certainly not memorable nor worth the price we paid for it. All and all it was a mediocre establishment with a price tag that exceeded their abilities.<//Review>

< Review>
This is one of the best kept secrets in Oakland. I’m blown away every time. My advice, order everything on the cicchetti menu. Don’t miss out on the dessert sampler. Every pasta is house made. The wine menu is unique and delicious. What else is there in life?<//Review>

<rate>4< /rate><review>Love this place! Been here several times and the food is always excellent. I love the fact that they will half a main salad to have as a side salad with entree.  Only reason to not give 5 stars is because there were 4 of us and we wanted the window table.  The server first told us we could have that table.  When it was time to be seated she changed her mind and told us it was reserved for a 5 top.  We were seated at another table and it was so dark we had to use our phone flashlights to read the menu (this was at lunch). We were there for 2 hours and no one ever showed up for the 5 top reservation.  There were only 3 tables seated the whole time we were there so see no reason we couldn't have had the window table.  Other than that, the food and service is truly excellent and would have given 5 stars if not for being told we could have window seat and then telling us no.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Good food, but the seating was very loud and busy.  We had to shout, and were constantly bumped by wait staff and other customers.  And that was with reservations.
Also, the wine was good, but there was a very limited selection and we couldn't order a bottle.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Eclectic ingredients combined with kitchen wizardry. Food so good, so sophisticated you will want to get the menu back to review the ingredients and puzzle how they could be combined into such delicious creations.

<Text>This place was really good but quite crowded. Make sure that you call ahead before arriving, otherwise you define yourself having to go somewhere else. My wife had found you only and I had the sword fish which was absolutely wonderful. We finish things up with goat cheesecake which was to die for.<//Text>< pictures>

LOVE Zachary's deep dish pizzas. Have loved this place for nearly 30 years. Whether you take and bake, take out or eat in, those pies are so delicious. Stewed tomatoes on top of the deep dish pizza is fantastic. Bring one to a potluck -- always welcome.< /review>

I love the fact that even in three fixed 4 course menu, every course had a vegetarian option! We we here on Friday evening, the place was packed, and a bit to noisy. It was a bit hard to have a conversation due to the noise.. The food was very good, every course was interesting and tasty. If you like cheese, this place has a lot to offer to you.. The burrata dish was so delicious! It's hand made, and they are selling it to go as well. The gnocchi was nice, but something was missing to make it really good..
Even though the restaurant was full, the service was good, and went above and beyond to satisfy us!</text>

I loved this place because random people from the bar came to my table and made me order cheesecake. And that cheesecake was amazing, even though I had to tell Netty that she's not the boss of me, I was actually pretty glad she bossed me into getting that cheesecake.</text>

Great place!
Food was amazing, we ordered a board of meat and cheese, some pasta and duck. We enjoyed great wine and small dessert.

We're going back for sure!<//text>

<Date>1485322975624<//Date><Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Other than the noise and extreme busy-ness that made it hard to have a nice , enjoyable dinner, it was very good.  I didn't realize it was Oakland Restaurant Week so perhaps that explains it.; but tables are very close together which made it worse.
However the food and service were great.  The duck pate was wonderful, the milk-braised pork shoulder on pasta was a great blend of flavors and cooked to perfection.  My partner had the meatball appetizer which was fair, and the Gnocchi with mushrooms which was very flavorful.
We had the Venetian donuts for dessert which were interesting and fine but I wouldn't order them again.  Wine selection was nice.  Our server was very personable and welcoming and provided great service throughout the entire meal.
Lastly, we very much appreciated the choice of two sizes for the entrees; that is perfect for us and I wish more restaurants offered this option.  Aside from allowing us to leave room for dessert, it's nice on the budget as well.  I recommend the restaurant and look forward to our next visit.< /Review>< Pics>

The food was exceptional. With the service it was clear they did their best, but it was still not sufficiently attentive. Forgot to bring a drink I ordered, took a long time to bring us water.. stuff like that.< /Review>

Fantastic -- amazing food, great service. One of the best meals I've had in a long time. We ate here a few weeks ago when we were in the SF area -- this was the best meal we had during our trip -- I wish we lived closer and could eat at Bellanico again soon.</review>

The restaurant is small, cozy and has an atmosphere that appeals to locals and foodies. Horrible parking is a factor so make sure to alot time for searching if you drive and reservations are highly suggested.< /review>< Pics>

Went for a Father's day brunch and was pretty disappointed. The reviews seemed good but we were surprised to find that their brunch menu didn't even feel Italian with the exception of 1-2 dishes including the malfatti pasta, which was drowning in a pool of brown butter. Most of the dishes felt like forced brunch dishes (e.g. A pork shoulder panini that they added an egg to.) To be fair, I should probably go back for dinner to give it another shot. However, I must say the first visit was not confidence inspiring.</text>

One of the best Italian restaurants around, with fantastic wine (including some bio dynamic/natural options), and an innovative menu. I usually go for the 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings, which is a phenomenal deal at ~$60. Highly recommended.</text>

First of all my family owns Bellanico and i think we do a pretty good job at running it.
So i think i would rate Bellanico 4 1/2 stars because the food is excellent, the service is fine and lastly because it has a nice sense of Italy. Bellanico is a family-friendly restaurant with a nice taste of Italy</text>

Went for a birthday dinner and was disappointed. First, when the reservation was made, they were told it was a birthday dinner, but there was no acknowledgement. Two of us had the tasting menu, one had the fried cauliflower balls with lemon aioli, and duck entree, both delicious. The Red Kuri squash in the risotto was still a little crunchy, not sure if that was how it was supposed to be, but I would have liked it softer. One of the desserts came in a slapdash fashion in a glass.  Service was not up to par compared to our previous visits. Won't be back for some time but hope last night was an off night. Used to be a good Italian restaurant in the neighborhood and would love to see it stay that way.<//text>

Portions are small & VERY overpriced. We spent almost $200 on a meal for 3 people w/ a bottle of wine. We could have gotten more food & better wine at another restaurant in Oakland... For me it just wasn't worth it, but I'm glad I tried it.<//review><Time>1492363896939</Time><Gmap_id>0x808f8709bf198a93:0xcd5804ad878895a1</Gmap_id></record>

Always impressed with their dinners but came for the first time for brunch and was blown away with the freshness  and creativity of the menu. Just great flavors and change of pace for standard brunch fare.  Gets very busy on weekends so arrive on the early or later side.</Text>

<Text>We went during the week of specials in January. Had a tuna appetizer (delicious); duck confit (a tad too salty for my taste); and beignets for dessert. My friend had a panini sandwich that she liked. This is a small neighborhood restaurant that is well supported by the residents of the area. Service was efficient and prompt. Even for a weekday lunch they had very good business. Would recommend making reservations and give yourself time to find parking.<//Text>< pictures>

peffect neighborhood spot.  Great food.  Tasting menu
and wine flights.  Versital menu allows a satisfying bowl of pasta or the adventure of the tasting menu.  One table was satisfied with wine and dessert.  Great looking pork chop.  Best swordfish I have ever tasted<//review>

<Review>A very good experience to take your special someone out for a dinner.  Their fixed price menu allowed you to have 4 excellent selections and the wine list was extensive.

The place is small, so I had reservations. However, my table wasn't ready when we arrived, and there isn't any place for waiting guests to sit.  We had to huddle awkwardly around the tables near the door while the table was prepared.<//Review>< Pics>

So disappointed with bellanico.   We haven't eaten here in over a year.  Tonight, we sat at the bar - service was pretty bad.   My darling man had the seared pork belly-tasteless.  My arugala salad was dry and the bartender over charged us on one of our drinks.  We're done with them.</review>

<review>Came here to pick up take out. The Manager rushed over to the door when I walked up to speak with me before I came inside. It was weird, like he did not want me in there.

Was invited to dinner there last Saturday night.  While the food was good, the execution left a lot to be desired.  Did not get bread for 50 minutes after sitting down.  Duck pate appetizer order was totally forgotten; it ended up being served with the Primo course once waiter was reminded it was a dish we ordered.  The pate was dense, creamy and had lovely flavor.  Fried Squash Blossoms with lentils were fabulous.  The panna cotta, pork belly, and farro salad dishes were enjoyed by the others.  Two diners had the Liberty duck breast/leg - breast was moist and tender; leg was a little dry.  The risotto was tasty with pine nuts and the pork chop was huge - she took half of it home.  But nicely cooked.  The waiter was a bit testy about us bringing our own Amarone wine to share but this varietal was not on their menu.  A lecture about how we should put the $20 corkage fee towards buying one of their bottles of wine is not really the way customers should be treated.  Still, it could have just been an off night for our server and we should try again.  But parking in the area is really awful.    So realistically, we probably will not return.< /text>

Unfortunately, after dining at this restaurant I would NEVER RECOMMEND it to my worst enemy. Our waiter, an older man with glasses was extremely rude and we recieved very distasteful service. Me and my sister never felt more disrespected dining in Oakland, I will never walk into this restaurant or let any loved ones experience the same. Terrible terrible service!

< Review>
overpriced with small portions. waiter helpful with menu but never came back after food was served. Small and crowded inside. 26 dollars for beef belly 3oz which was only a boneless short rib which was overcooked and dry..where's the polenta? gnocchi flavorless with no hardly no sauce..Had to ask waiter for parmesan cheese. Ohhh the arugula salad was yummy for 10 dollars..Geezz..<//Review>

Pros:
- pork shoulder confit panini (mmm so tender and delicious)
- bombolini (fried dough covered in sugar with chocolate and sage dipping sauces)
- duck confit hash (I am a sucker for good meat + potatoes)
- cool atmosphere and good service
- server altered the dessert sampler for us since we had already ordered one of the desserts it contains

Cons:
- too far from me and only street parking available :(
- food is just a teeny weeny bit on the oily side (but not enough to deter me!)

Bottom line: favorite brunch in Albany! Everyone I've taken here has found something to love. GOOO< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Local not very large, the food is good pasta homemade, without tablecloth and there are no good options to drink if you do not drink alcohol, just portions

The restaurant was practically empty, with only one customer ahead of my coworker and myself. We both ordered salads. I placed my order first. It took 30 minutes for my coworker to get her salad order, which was placed several minutes after mine (I ordered a Southwest Chicken Salad). There were at least 5 people working in the kitchen. I really can't say what they were working on, but it most certainly was not my simple salad! After being asked 3 times, what I ordered, I simply decided to get my refund! No apology for poor service, no anything! All I heard as I was leaving,  was "cancel the salad!" Since when does it take more than 30 minutes to make a salad?! I will not return! Zero stars if it was possible!<//Review>

<text>Delicious Charbroiled Tuna Sandwich (all bun/sandwich items can be requested as a lettuce wraps) & Tampura Green Beans! Fries, Onion Rings, and Sweet Potato Fries are also an option!!
Great customer service. Online ordering makes this establishment innovative and diligent for a quick bite to eat.

Enjoy beverage refills of Strawberry Lemonade, Peach and Ginger Nectar, and the classic carbonated sodas.< /text>< pictures>

Update: Still no answer from messaging them, good luck to anybody trying to contact.  Changing to one star from two.

The first time I ate here was good.  Everything was correct and the food was good.  This time around my order was wrong and I didn't realize it until later.  I have a bad habit of trusting places to not make mistakes but this wasn't even a minor mistake.  I ordered a portobello mushroom charburger with sourdough substitute and added bacon.  What I got instead was some kind of chicken sandwich, with no premium ingredients.  It very clearly costs less than what I paid for.  I can't be bothered to go back and I'm just not ever going to return.  To anybody that tries this place, make absolutely sure you got what you ordered before you leave.</Review>

Burger was edible, to much sauce and therefore very drippy. Fries were completely not edible. Cold and very very soggy. Watched our fries and onion rings sit on top of counter for over ten minutes while waiting on burgers.<//text>

My first visit to The Habit and it was underwhelming.  We ordered a garden salad and it tasted like an airline salad with wishbone dressing.  I was hugely disappointed when I ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar cheese and was told they only have 2 types of cheese...yellow American and white American.  This is a burger restaurant with no cheddar.  I got an overpriced fast food burger with cold sweet potato fries.  The dinning area is so small and the outside seating didn't have heaters.</Review>

Usually love the food. Today (3/21/2021) we noticed they had added self ordering kiosks. We customized each of our meals, but when we got home we realize our food was not made the way we ordered it. Unfortunately we also didn't get the add-ons that we were charged for.
What's the point of a self kiosk and customizing your order if they're not gonna read the order?!< /Text>

I ordered through the app for curbside pickup for two chocolate malts we waited patiently in the car after i checked in. Not a single person came outside to the curbside. After 40 minutes I had to go inside and the employee couldnt find my order. Another employee asked for my order and then proceeded to hand me two melted malts with only an "im sorry" The didnt offer to remake fresh ones. They claim my car wasnt on there but I had inputed it nd even if there wasnt a description they should have someone come out and check. UNBELIEVABLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE HORRIBLE.</Review>

Very disappointed. Ordered, and paid an extra $1.50 for, bacon to be added and there was no bacon.  Because I had to be home to relieve an outside caretaker, I didn't have time to go back in. Also, my burger was barely warm.<//review>

Usually we love the Habit. Best fast food around. Today it was a long wait, cold food, and looks like they are now serving smaller burgers. Maybe that's just my perception though. Either way, not the quality we have become used to.</Review>

<review>Placed an order for delivery missing my onion rings, burgers made wrong, ordered extra crispy fries and got under cooked fries. Called for a refund on the onion rings and was told I had to go the store for a refund...really. If I wanted to visit the location I wouldn’t have ordered delivery. Only my second visit to this location and will be my last. Too many other choices to deal with this nonsense. Wasn’t cheap spent close to $70 in food.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The first time I ordered from there was good, but after some time they began to disappoint me. Im not complaining about the flavor and whatnot. Instead its about customer service. 4 times did they get my order wrong and its a very simple order and easy to prepare. Usually I order a plain char burger with strawberry lemonade and fries. After getting the order wrong several times they ended up giving me 3 coupons for one free burger each. I decided to use one, but they got it wrong again. Instead I got a Hawaiian burger. What made it worse this time was that for some reason it was very soggy, as well as the French fries and other side dishes in the bag. I asked my mom and she confirmed that it was oil. Luckily not a lot of it was on the burger. I understand if they mess it up the first or second time, but 4 times is when I have to intervene.< /Text>

Great food! Had a little bit of a wait do to online orders but Dave took care of us. Really liked the way Dave and Vinny handled everything. While waiting we witnessed some customers being very rude to these guys and their team but they didn't break or act unprofessional, they did a great job. Definitely recommend to everyone.</text>

Visited earlier today to pick up an order inside all i have to say is that I appreciate every one of those hard workers during this pandemic especially when not many places are open. Unfortunately when I walked in it was hotter than outside, this is not good for the employees and im a manager who works in food, i know there are state/union regulated standards to employee health in their working environment. I'm surprised that none of them have dropped from heat stroke/exhaustion. I work with an oven I know how miserable it can get without proper ventilation and A/C. FIX IT NOW! Or you are going to have a problem....< /review>

Actually, the string beans were crispy at this location versus my local Habit. I have to say Limonite Avenue makes them better.  Otherwise, you know what you're getting... Good burgers.  I love ordering online and having the food ready when I get there. The convenience of modern times.< /text>

First time to eat at The Habit today. A friend recommended it to me because he knows I love cheese burgers. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the temperature in the restaurant, warm. If the A/C was on it was set pretty high. Very stuffy stagnate air in the dinning area. Was greated by a friendly women who I assumed was a manager or shift leader because she was wearing a different colored shirt than everyone else. I ordered the sesonal item, Santa Barbara Char burger. Comes with 2 burger patties both topped with cheddar cheese and grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and avocado. I also got an order of fries, well done,  because lets be honest, fries are never as crispy as they should be because restaurants are in such a hurry to get food out. Also ordered the tempura green beans. My friend got the single char with swiss, grilled onions and lettuce. He's kind of a plain guy, I always say you can tell a lot about a person by how they order a cheese burger. Anywho my Santa Barbara burger was good the patties were seasoned properly the cheese was perfectly gooey, melty, the grilled onions were ok. Not as carmelized as they could be in my opinion. The Santa Barbara char comes on grilled bread not your traditional hamburger bun. All in all a pretty good burger. It just still has that synthetic fast food feel about it. No home made love feel like I get at In n Out or Riders Club. The fries were cooked well as I ordered them but you could tell they were frozen. Definitely not In n Out fresh cut quality. The tempura green beans were good. But for $2.99 I feel like we should have got more than what they gave us, kinda stingy if you know what I mean. Drink selection was good. I'm an iced tea guy so it was pretty cool they had three fresh brewed teas to choose from, black tea, tropical tea and a citrus green tea. Also had strawberry limeade which was pretty good. In the end I would eat here again if I was in the area and didn't want to wait the 15 minutes it would take to get to In n Out.</text>

The servers/ cooks where very unprofessional and disrespectful. This has been one of my favorites spots to eat, I have eaten at a lot of different locations and the service has been great. Is disappointing to have experience this disrespect event at this Eastvale ca location. I’m a paying customer who always gives the respect due to people who work at this place   No reason why they not do the same .  Never again. Is the young guy with the funny tattoos in his arm. Poor place to take family out to eat.< /review>

< Review>
I came here to get my son his birthday charburger.
While I was there I placed an order for my other sons and a burger for myself.
I placed the order to go because I didn't want to spend too much time in a crowded place with everything that has been going on.
I don't exactly live near this location, it's a good 10 miles or so from home.
I got notification that my order was ready.
The person working stated that the burgers were in one bag, underneath the fries and the other bag contained the kid's meal for my little one.
I looked inside and saw the burgers under there so I assumed they were all there.
When I got home and opened the bag, I immediately noticed that there was a burger missing, my burger.
The one that I paid extra for.
Their promotional Jalopeno Tempura Charburger.
I am usually a calm person, but I can not stand people who do not do their job properly.
This person stated to me that the burgers were under the fries.
Obviously, he was wrong.
I felt ripped off.
I paid for something that I did not receive.
I tried to call the store but calling the number does not result in contacting anyone physically at the location, but rather a call center.
Completely POINTLESS!
I am not going to drive 20-25 minutes go get something I was supposed to have in the first place.
When someone places an order, especially when it's to go, there should be extra care taken to make sure everything is in order.
There is nothing that can be done now to fix what has happened.
You guys dropped the ball here.
This is totally unacceptable and I do not see myself returning to this location again.</Review>

<Review>The place has good food except the fries were cold and saggy. I gave them 2 stars based on the lack of cleanliness and their saggy fries. The tables were filthy. The floor was extremely sticky and every table had trash around it. The drink area had so much trash I was not able to put the drink down to put a lid on it.

The poor girl giving out the food was also responsible for cleaning the area. She kept apologizing to people when they would ask her if someone could go clean the table.

Management really needs to have a specific  person to be responsible for keeping the place clean.</Review>< resp>

Seriously, whoever was cooking there on the night of 1/2/2019... never let them go. Give them whatever they want in life. Also the people providing customer service... freaking epic!!! The burger and the steak sandwiches were magical. And I ate it the day after. I wanted to tip but I didn't bring cash. I wish I could put 20 stars on this.< /review>

Today 08/05/20 my wife and I treated Hobbit for the first time and apparently it was a mistake, very bad service, the order was bad when it seemed to white people, they served it well because everyone else's orders were good and at their own time and mine bad late, I don't recommend it</review>

Received a gift card and was excited to try for first time.  The service was fine but the burgers were so salty that is all you could taste. Very greasy too. Fries were OK.  I will say the malts were great.  I was surprised how many people were eating food from other resteraunts there.
Customer care reached out to me after my review and I agreed to try again.  I ordered the burger with NO seasoning and it was great.  My husband got a bbq tri tip sandwich and said it was good.  Of course malts.  Glad we went back will eat there again. Changing my review.< /Text>

<time>1565308184587< /time><rating>1<//rating><Review>I came here and ordered the Santa Barbara Char, expecting to receive something even moderately edible and was sorely disappointed. This "burger" is the soggiest, and most bland piece of trash I have ever spent money on just to throw away. The meat has no seasoning, the guacamole has no spice, and all the flavor came from the disgusting mayonnaise I forgot to ask to have removed.

To make matters worse, the inside of the restaurant smelled absolutely delicious. Now I say it smells absolutely delicious inside but the air was thick with the smell of Asian cuisine, not that of a burger joint. My senses were absolutely confused, and the entire scenario was off putting.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>First time to eat at The Habit today. A friend recommended it to me because he knows I love cheese burgers. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the temperature in the restaurant, warm. If the A/C was on it was set pretty high. Very stuffy stagnate air in the dinning area. Was greated by a friendly women who I assumed was a manager or shift leader because she was wearing a different colored shirt than everyone else. I ordered the sesonal item, Santa Barbara Char burger. Comes with 2 burger patties both topped with cheddar cheese and grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and avocado. I also got an order of fries, well done,  because lets be honest, fries are never as crispy as they should be because restaurants are in such a hurry to get food out. Also ordered the tempura green beans. My friend got the single char with swiss, grilled onions and lettuce. He's kind of a plain guy, I always say you can tell a lot about a person by how they order a cheese burger. Anywho my Santa Barbara burger was good the patties were seasoned properly the cheese was perfectly gooey, melty, the grilled onions were ok. Not as carmelized as they could be in my opinion. The Santa Barbara char comes on grilled bread not your traditional hamburger bun. All in all a pretty good burger. It just still has that synthetic fast food feel about it. No home made love feel like I get at In n Out or Riders Club. The fries were cooked well as I ordered them but you could tell they were frozen. Definitely not In n Out fresh cut quality. The tempura green beans were good. But for $2.99 I feel like we should have got more than what they gave us, kinda stingy if you know what I mean. Drink selection was good. I'm an iced tea guy so it was pretty cool they had three fresh brewed teas to choose from, black tea, tropical tea and a citrus green tea. Also had strawberry limeade which was pretty good. In the end I would eat here again if I was in the area and didn't want to wait the 15 minutes it would take to get to In n Out.< /Text>< time>

Clean restaurant, friendly staff, flavorful food. The price is great too. Can easily spend the same amount at McDonalds. Would give 5 stars but they forgot the grilled onions on my burger. I would eat there again.<//Review>

<Text>Food was very good. Good service. Liked the beverage assortment. Place was very clean. Knowledgeable staff. Well, except a 'manager'  who I overhead talking to a young employee about Food Safety as he was counciling her about not cleaning up a small spill on the floor. But except for his misunderstanding the difference between Safety and Food Safety I will be back. Try it, you will enjoy it.</Text><Response>None</Response>< date>

UPDATE 1/26/19
well I must say my experience was a bit better than before my food was excellent this time but (I know there's a but )the staff  seemed Soo dull  don't know  I'm use to going to the habit all the time (my favorite place to eat). The habit see is known for  being so welcoming this location just isn't. Butt This one staff member that was definitely on point with his customer service he stood out  his name was Dave aka purple shirt Dave👍🏽.

(Old review)
They was slow but they food was the same but eh idk different location just can't ever give same quality or service 🤷🏽‍♀️:c<//Review>

I like the fact that they cook their burgers on a grill in front of you. It tasted nice and hot and fresh.</review>

Just the right size burger at just the right price. The menu is simple and the service friendly. They don’t have Dr. Pepper but they have lemonade. You may dine in or sit outside and take in the sites and people watch.</review>

This is my first time and also last, went there at 5pm today,  the line was long, took 10 minutes to order then waited 15 minutes to get my food. Meat patties were dry and tasteless. I ordered the mushrooms char, the golden chicken sandwich, and also 2 of Santa Barbara style as well. Thought trying more than one thing would be great but they were all terrible. My buns were chewy and very dry like they are old, pretty nasty. I threw most of my food away including the fries, very bland. I ordered tempura green beans and they were not crunchy but at least it was not bland. I asked for no pickles, spicy sauce for the chicken on the side, and avocado on the side because of food allergies. They ignored all request and that's why I'll never go back. They also give half patty on the Santa Barbara style instead of full meat patty... that was just a rip off. What I liked about this place... seating area outside.</text>

Love the Habit! Often has a line up but that's because the food is awesome.  My favorite is the Chicken Sandwich on Sourdough adding pineapple and teriyaki sauce...messy but soooo good! Also love their tempura style green beans.
They've just added a number of salads, which is great if you're wanting something without bread.< /text>

<Text>Called in my order so that I could pick it up quick and head back home.  They told me my order would be ready at 7pm.  Well somehow my order got lost even though I had already paid for it over the phone.  Finally at 7:20 the person behind the counter offers to give me the food that's been sitting around for 30 minutes if I'd pay again.   Umm,  no thanks.  I will be calling the bank in the morning and I will not be back here.< /Text>< pics>

The Habit is a great place for food (try their tempura green beans, seriously -- life changing if you don't like green beans!) but more than this the Eastvale location's service is spectacular. I've never had a negative experience with the Habit, but the one at this location was above and beyond. Employees (not the manager, if I have their uniforms straight) walked around when they had no line and made sure everything was good for the customers, one even getting someone a refill. Really above and beyond imo!!< /Review>

Burgers are delicious. The sweet potato fries are really good. Plus they have complimentary jalapeño, sport peppers and pepperocini for you to add to your Burger. Fast service. It gets busy during noon time And after 5pm until about 8pm.< /Review>

What was once good has now changed, it's a shame The Habbit use to have great burgers now they changed them and are now dried up meat patties... This se to be one of my favourite spots to get a burger, the meat was grilled just right use to be able to order them medium rare until Californias health morons swooped in and ruined everything now i just get a dried up medium or medium well piece of meat i can throw around like a damn frisbee! Hell Carl's Jr makes a better burger and i thought they had dried up burgers but compared to The Habbit an new management I'd rather have Carl's now!</text>

<Review>When you open at 10:30..but it is now...10:47 and still not open "because you are fixing something? And it will be about 5 mins" Then send an associate to buy a STARBUCKS BEVERAGE..

Food is usually really good, but was disappointed by the service today.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Unlike most Habit Burger establishments, this one unfortunately falls short on service, seating occupancy, and a friendly staff. If you want patio eatery, this is it. Unfortunately for my family and I, today was 105° and sitting by the restrooms was our only option.</review>< pics>
