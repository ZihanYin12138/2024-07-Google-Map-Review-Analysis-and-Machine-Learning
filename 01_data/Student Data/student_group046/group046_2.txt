<review>Our sewer nine backed up - I called McKeown on a Saturday, Halloween, at about 10:30 AM. They had someone at my house in less than a hour.
The job was completed in less than an hour.
The plumbers they sent were polite and knowledgeable.
The bill was very reasonable for a rush job on a weekend.
They did a great job</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1598472586017, 'text': 'Thank you!'}< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>We recently bought a Laguna house and had a plumbing back-up.  McKeown immediately sent out David who easily cleared the line and provided us with video of the home's plumbing system.  He took the time to explain what he saw, made suggestions, and was genuinely knowledgeable and pleasant... all at a very fair price.

<Text>Juan Carlos was very helpful and knowledgeable. His diagnosis made sense in that he thought the roots in our landscape drain were from a palm. We had planted a palm 5 years ago on the other side of the building. We will remove it and have Juan Carlos come back to check root growth after winter rains. Thanks so much.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I have used McKeown for over 30 years. They are always professional and responsive. Their excellent at solving problems and their pricing is very fair. My last call involved an issue with a faucet. I called them on a Friday and they were out the next day to address my issue. Thanks to all at McKeown!<//Text>

<Text>Had a "gas leak' issue with an appliance. The tech showed up on time,diagnosed the problem, and recommended a valve/line replacement. Problem solved and the tech was in possession of the replacement parts. I am sure the tech thought the problem was simple  but I appreciated his expertise.

< review>
I have used McKeown Plumbing for 8 years and they have done several jobs for me with the utmost professionalism and on time service.  I just had a slab leak and after 1 week of Service Master cleaning up the leak mess, McKeown came out and did a full reroute of the cold water line.  They completed the work faster and 20% under the estimate the insurance company gave me.  I have had a great experience with them not just once or twice or three times but at least 6 or 7 times over the last 8 years.  Very happy, 6 Stars !!< /review>

Showed-up on time, wore booties on shoes, face mask for anti COVID-19, and thoroughly cleaned-up the mess as a resuilt of opening-up the pipes, drain seems to be working well.</Review>

The second time was discovering and repairing a prior plumbers mistakes!  I will now only use McKeown Plumbing, they are trustworthy, dependable, clean and priced fairly!<//Text>

If I could give less than zero I would! Totally unprofessional in every way and completely incompetent!
Not so fast 45 years in business!  You are not being honest!  You can add that to my review, too!! Your service man did start the job!! And you know this had nothing to do with your service car parked in my driveway!!</Text>

We did make a mistake- and that was to park our vehicle in the driveway and for that we apologize.

Rating us as incompetent or excellent for that matter is just not possible and not reasonable in our opinion.'}</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I recently had a main sewer line in need of repair. I called a plumber who I had been using for years in Laguna their name starts with a (A) for those of you who are local, and it was a nightmare getting them to even come out. As a matter of fact they called back 15 minutes before their scheduled appointment and hung up saying it was too late in the day to come!! This mind you was a emergency call. McKeown came out the same day fixed the problem which was a huge repair. They were prompt, professional, and the job was done in no time, at a very fair cost!! 10 STARS!! I will only call them from this point on. And I won't write a negative review on the (A) company but very disappointed in them. Already called McKeown today for another job!! Customer service is key these days!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1582740291614, 'text': 'Thank you Denise!'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce5d041d30077:0xe54e9ff1f25efd9e< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>After seeing the 1 star post, I had to give my opinion. I have used McKeown Plumbing a few times over the years and they have always gone above and beyond to do the job right and make it right. Their pricing has been fair and their work excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone in the Laguna Beach area.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1590191802556, 'text': 'We appreciate the positive feedback.

This company is TERRIBLE!!!  I asked them to come run a water line from the kitchen sink to the other side of the kitchen for our new Keurig which is only about 10ft (it is a small apartment in Laguna Beach).  The Keurig needed a part to it which they offered to order for us, we paid them almost $300 and have been waiting for them to come back with the part they ordered.  It is has been almost 3 weeks and I've called and text them several times trying to see when the part is coming in and when they would be back to finish the work they started that we already paid for.  Within the 3 weeks, they answered ONE time saying the part should be arriving this week and they will be here to install it.  It's been a week since, I've placed numerous follow up calls but no has answered.  Over the course of 3 weeks, I've tried to reach out to this company and no one answers their phone, no one returns calls, and they have charged us the $300 for unfinished work.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!< /Text>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1450749630450, 'text': 'Hi Jen, sorry you feel this way or for any inconvenience.  We try hard to make our customers happy.  The $285.00 was for the copper water line run and an angle stop, which was completed.  In speaking with the guys, we were going to try and locate the part for your Keurig and install it as courtesy.  If you feel like you need some sort of reimbursement, then we would be happy to discuss that with you.  Sorry for any miscommunication or if we lost track of finding the part.  Again, we try our best to help everyone and be a fair and honest company.  Happy holidays.\n\nJon\nOwner'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dce5d041d30077:0xe54e9ff1f25efd9e< /gmap_id></record>

I have worked here a couple of seasons. I would just like to see more growth within the employees. I would like to see a rotation type of thing so people won't hurt so much from their neck for looking down sorting cherries and doing a repetitive thing all day long, that way they can also get trained in doing other things. Which is good cause everyone would be capable of doing most things around the warehouse. It's all bout growth and given the opportunity to do so.</text>

I'm not in the fruit business, and I clearly do not understand how they operate, but this place is weird. So far I have seen no fruit better than a marginal second at best. Loading order is haphazard and far from first come first served (maybe those who are jumped ahead in line have some sort of reservation). Here on a Saturday (a busy day for them), so maybe that has something to do with it. Waiting three hours so far to load. Clean facility and courteous employees as far as I can see.
After 6 hours they bring out a pallet of totally green cherries that will never ripen. Says they will have ripe tomorrow, if you believe that.
Next day, after 4 hour wait, now have partial order of very nice looking fruit.
Part of the problem seems to be much higher demand than available product.< /Review>

COSTCO SOLD PRIMA FRUTTA CHERRIES.

IF YOU CAN IGNORE THE DENTED, BRUISED AND ABUSED APPEARANCE OF THEIR CHERRIES...THEN IT'S YOUR CALL.

I COULDN'T.

When your the only game in town you can favor any teams you want who give you the most money. Our team scored a goal and the ref missed it how do you miss a goal. This was by far the worst experience ever good luck teams if your not a Turlock team or Ajax.👎👎👎👎👎👎< /Text>

Friendly environment, new updated window panels so you can see your child play. Only downfall is some of the referees simply do not call fouls.<//review>

<Date>1628624171136<//Date><rating>5<//rating><Review>I have been to Alberto a few times now after being recommended to me by a family friend. First he was able to fix a pearl ring of mine where the pearl had fallen out from not being secured properly. He also assisted in fixing a necklace of mine that had a jewel out of place and most recently he was able to take a look at a few pieces of mine and order me a gold chain for some pendants. I always receive great service and trust Alberto completely with my pieces. He was even able to stay open late for me. Highly recommend his services!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Excellent resizing of my antique ring! I had an Art Deco opal and platinum ring that was too small and needed to be sized up one full size. I requested that the many hallmarks inside the band remain intact, and they were able to do this as promised. The exterior of the band also had a rough/matte finish to it, and they were able to keep that finish. The work is flawless. The ring fits perfectly and I am very pleased. The father and son team are a pleasure to work with.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK-siIn9_trlYskOazd6X7PQohk_MJnDGDcVOn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbeE4krDmiLU5tL6Zyz7zDR5wujOp47ASiXWgT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<text>EDIT: Alberto called me back and offered to polish my ring! It seems like it was a mistake and they meant to polish before returning it back to me.

I chose to get my ring resized here because of the reviews about the quick turnaround time. I dropped off my ring on Wednesday and i got my ring back the following Tuesday! You cannot tell at all that I got it resized 1.5 sizes down! Though, it seems like polishing is a seperate fee from the resizing, so be sure to ask for that when you're dropping off your jewelry! Attached is a picture of my ring after getting it resized.< /text><Time>1614284353559<//Time>< userid>

<review>Edmund Jewelers offered a great experience! So much so I'm returning later on in the year, with another project.

I needed a ring downsized from size 8 to 5. Unlike other jewelers (who insisted I make an in person appointment) Edmund Jewelers made the whole process very convenient by assessing my jewelry online, and giving me a quote via email.

The ring itself came out flawless (see photo), the team have an incredible eye for detail. Alberto made sure on pick up my ring fit perfectly. He even expanded the ring by a couple of millimeters (upon request) to make it a more comfortable fit.

Alberto and his father Edmund have been operating in San Francisco for decades. I highly recommend choosing them for your jewelry needs.<//review>< Date>

I brought in my wedding band to be resized (made larger) and Alberto was able to increase it by 3 sizes!!! They were fast and very professional! I've already suggested them to all my friends as we all have something particularly heirlooms that need to be resized!!!
I was so impressed that I'm also looking now to have some rings etc. upcycled/re-imagined as they do such great work!
Did I mention they polished my ring gratis/for free!?!?</Review>

<review>I was able to get a quote for the services I needed from Alberto who was very pleasant to speak with. I was able to bring my ring in to be resized and dealt with Edmund who was very knowledgeable and kind. They did a great job - my ring was beautifully handled and the service was incredible. I highly recommend this establishment and hope I can come back to support this family business again soon!<//review>< userid>

For the most exquisite and high-quality investment-grade fine jewelry, Edmund R Weber Jewelers is a pleasure to shop, not only because of the beautiful handmade and uniquely designed and well-crafted pieces, but also for the caring, professional, excellent customer service combined with knowledge and experience of this multi-generational family-run and owned shop which stands by its work, and which has been in business delighting clients and their loved ones for over half a century.
From beautiful gems and stones shown to full advantage and protected in platinum gold or silver settings, fine pearls from delicately small sized to gargantuan baubles,  whether you pick out a ready-made piece or have the Webers create one you commission, you can enjoy wearing your fine piece forever or even have them repurpose an outdated piece by updating it.
My family has been wearing exquisite jewelry made by Edmund Weber for decades. Edmund and his son, Alberto Weber, stand by their work. For appraisals and cleaning and repair as well as purchasing jewelry this is a great shop giving unsurpassed value, quality and workmanship.</Text>

<Text>I can not recommend Alberto and his father Edmund enough.  I had a very tall order for them to fill!  I had the hardest time finding a vintage ring that was exactly what I was looking for.  I called around and went to numerous other jewelers.  Literally no one understood what I wanted.  I then heard of Alberto, and gave him a call.  From our first phone call I could tell he had a lot of experience with jewelry.  He asked me a bunch of questions other jewelers hadn’t, and ultimately I decided to ask him to make a custom ring for me.  I met with him in person and he took his time making sure he understood what I wanted.  My ring is absolutely stunning.  I loved working with him, and recommend him to anyone looking for a wonderful jeweler!</Text><Gmap_id>0x8085808918e125bd:0x4f6ecfa8aad8d982< /Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating><pics>None< /pics><UserId.>117886271247256956926<//UserId.><Date>1601947936597</Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Dropped off a yellow gold ring with a jade setting to be re-sized and mentioned I'd purchased it at Gump's 20+ years (and probably 30 lbs) ago. Turns out Weber used to make jewelry for Gump's, so I'd clearly come to the right place.

Ring was ready in less than a week and at a very fair price. I went up a size-and-a-half and I know that going up more than one ring size can be tricky - but they did a fantastic job! The re-sizing is completely invisible and the ring fits me perfectly now.  Great work from this local, family-owned business.<//review>< pics>

I had the pleasure of getting my engagement ring resized with Edmund R. Weber Jewelers. I got engaged right before lockdown in March and have been waiting to take in my ring to get it resized. I found Edmund R. Weber Jewelers on Yelp and they had all 5-star reviews. I sent them a message via Yelp getting a quote for a ring resize as well as an appraisal for a necklace I got as a gift a few years back. They quickly responded. The next day I came in, dropped off my jewelry and was able to pick it up the following day. Wow, wow, wow! They are so professional, nice, they explain everything to you, and they are very fast with quality craftsmanship. I will also be writing a similar review on Yelp because I want to help this small business in SF continue to thrive through a global pandemic and beyond!< /text>

If I could give them more stars, I would. These folks resized an engagement ring for my fiancée and a wedding band for me, the latter of which they did on short notice after we realized that the band was too small. It was my grandfather's wedding band, so it was rather old, and they had to enlarge it a couple sizes and add the detailing around the edge by hand to make the new portion of the ring look like the old one. I can't thank them enough for helping our wedding day happen, and can't recommend them highly enough if you need custom jewelry work done. These guys are genuine pros.</Review>

I came to Weber Jewelers to get my engagement ring re-sized for $100 and they did a fantastic job (you can’t even tell that the ring was cut). There’s other jewelers that do the same kind of work for much less but Edmund Weber Jewelers is the only one that provides insurance for that extra reassurance (which is why I went with them). My overall experience was good except for the final polish. I distinctly remembered it being a satin matte polish with light striations and unfortunately, they weren’t able to achieve the artist’s original finishing touches. They tried and we got close to it but in my heart, it was not the same sheen I fell in love with.< /Review>

<Text>I am so happy I found this father son duo!! A handful of other jewelers in SF told me they wouldn’t work on my family antique ring, with two-tones/two metals the work would be too difficult. The Webers, on the other hand, didn’t hesitate. I knew my family ring was in good hands right away. The turnaround was also quick, when I wanted to pick it up early they made sure I’d be able to. And the ring is perfect! Wonderful service. Very excited to use this ring for my upcoming wedding. Thank you so much!< /Text>< gmap_id>

Excellent service! Very friendly. I needed a custom made engagement ring, and they nailed it with the raw design I had in mind. The quality of the piece is remarkable. They explained the whole process and material well, making me more comfortable about buying fine jewelry. The ring was ready even earlier than expected. 100% recommended.</Review>

Edmund and his son, Albert, are wonderful.  They sized-up my platinum engagement and wedding rings expertly.  The wedding band has milled edges, which makes it more difficult to do without showing.  I've looked carefully at the band and can't tell at all where the addition was made!  I'm so happy that I can once again wear my rings without struggling to take them off.

While I was at the shop, I admired the many beautiful pieces of jewelry they have, and we had a wonderful discussion about custom jewelry.  These two are real pros and "gems" to work with.  :D  I'd definitely return for all my fine jewelry needs.  Happy, happy, happy!< /review>

I had my engagement ring resized here and they did an absolutely beautiful job at a fair price. Alberto took the time to explain how a ring should fit and talk me through the process of sizing a ring in order to set my expectations. He'd said it would be done in about a week and a half but finished it in just under a week. Should I need any other jewelry repair/resizing I will definitely go back.< /review>

Very professional and knowledgeable. Personal service. Family/generation run business.We felt completely at ease and confident in our choice as soon as we sat down to discuss our jewelry repair. Charges are very reasonable, especially considering the expertise you are receiving. No one here is going to take advantage of you. Our repair was done very timely, resulting in a diamond re-set estate ring that was gorgeous, shiny, and spanking brand new looking. I recommend highly!< /review>

My husband-to-be bought my engagement ring here (after a friend had recommended it). I absolutely love my ring. when I went to have it re-sized, both Edmund and Alberto were both very kind and helpful! Alberto helped me choose the right size. Highly recommend Edmund R Weber!</Text>

Got my wedding ring resized at Webber Jewelers and I'm super happy with the result. I know nothing about rings and they helped me figure out what size I actually needed and even walked me through how they would do it. The ring looks perfect and fits soooo much better. Price seemed very reasonable.

On top of all that, Edmund and Alberto are both nice people. Would recommend!<//Review>

I had my engagement ring resized and an appraisal done. Both Edmund and Alberto provided detailed feedback about the process, and were very nice and professional. My ring came back at the perfect size and extra gold was added for stability over the longterm. They also polished it up, so it came back looking sparkling new!  I highly recommend for these services, and although, I came with a ring already, I would consider them for custom engagement rings too! They do beautiful work!< /text>

<text>Expert appraisal, friendly service!  I bought a pair of antique earrings online and wanted to learn more about its history, plus get the necessary paperwork for insurance.  Alberto & his father were easy to work with, and obviously very passionate about jewelry.  They also showed me a custom reproduction they were making for another client, and their workmanship is excellent!  I would recommend them to anyone looking for an appraisal or expertise in antique jewelry repairs.< /text>< Pictures>

I needed my engagement ring resized and requested multiple quotes from various jewelers in the city. Not only was the quote reasonable if not less than the other jewelers, the turnaround time was much faster. The ring looked exactly as it had when i dropped it off and fit perfectly! It was even ready sooner than expected. Overall great experience and will absolutely consider getting our wedding bands here.</review>

<Text>I had an excellent experience here. They were super prompt with my initial inquiry, gave me realistic time frames for the service and communicated throughout the process. I had a ring resizing and appraisal, both of which were reasonably priced and flawlessly executed. It's a family business and they are extremely knowledgable about jewelry. They pinpointed the origin of my family heirlooms from knowledge of the metal, which was particularly impressive. I'll be bringing more jewelry back to them.< /Text>< rate>

<text>I would love to say that I am a customer and I just bought the most amazing ring for the most amazing girl and our lives together are going to be better because of Edmund R Weber Jewelers 's. Unfortunately I only had a quick opportunity to be a party to a transaction, however, the level of customer service was so good that I understand why they are five stars. In fact I agree so much that I had to give them 5 stars too.< /text>< Rate>

For my nieces 21st birthday, I took her grandfathers wedding set to Edmund Weber jewelry.
I picked a pretty blue sapphire and got new prongs, they sized the rings for my niece. It is gorgeous.
They finished the job in about 10 days
With a reasonable price.<//Review>

Edmund and Alberto are amazing. After a hard wack of my hand on my iron gate, most of the diamonds in my wedding ring were loose. Alberto was honest in the evaluation of how my shared-prong ring was constructed and set honest expectations. But, he and Edmund took great care of my ring, and when it was handed back to me, I could tell the difference in quality of the construction of my ring. I think it would take a number of wacks on an iron gate now to get anything loose again, but I won't be trying that on purpose.< /text>

Thanks to all of the yelpers who posted positive reviews about this business before me!  I'm so glad to have taken the chance on Edmund and Alberto.

I brought in a damaged antique ring (missing a diamond- see photos) that was dented, yet delicate and difficult to work on, from what I understand.  Other jewelers had not done a great job before, and I was paranoid that my ring was losing the quality I thought it had when I received it.

I'm so impressed with the way that Edmund and Alberto were able to revive the ring.  They straightened out the lines that had become bent, replaced the diamond, and cleaned it beautifully.

I'll definitely be going back in the future.  They're old school perfection, with incredibly reasonable prices.</text>

Great Jewelers. Alberto made my wife's engagement and wedding rings and they turned out perfect. The quality of the craftsmanship is really impressive; I've had friends that went to the big box jewelers and they've had diamonds pop out and are left with subpart jewelry. I would highly recommend going here!< /Review>

<Review>Edmund Weber Jewelers is wonderful! After procrastinating for months, I finally took my engagement ring to them to get resized. Even though it as a rush request during busy season, they got it done nearly a week sooner than promised. I worked with Alberto, who was very friendly and professional. I had absolutely no qualms about leaving my ring, which is a family heirloom, with them  and will absolutely return for all future jewelry needs.<//Review><userid>107099454540731789158</userid>< GmapID>

My fiancé and I purchased my ring from Rafi and the whole experience was just wonderful! Rafi was patient and eager to answer all our questions. We never felt rushed or hustled.  He even helped my fiancé search for the best quality diamond across the U.S. within our budget and arranged to have the diamond sent from Chicago to his store for us to inspect without any promise to purchase.< /Review>

Great family business with incredible quality and very reasonable prices. I needed to get my ring resized and they were able to resize and polish it in 24hrs. My ring looks better now then it did when I dropped it off! Won't be looking anywhere else if I need a jeweler in the future.<//review>

Great little jeweler run by a couple guys. They were very friendly and were able to resize a wedding ring for me within a weeks time. I wasn't sure of my ring size so they had me try on some measuring rings. I ended up choosing the wrong size ring (went too large) and they happily took it back to size it a little smaller for me.< /Text>

I Love the fast service and pizza here they have not failed to make a great tasting pizza each time i visit this location I like the idea of curbside pickup where I can park and have the pizza brought to my car using their online website where I can also keep track of my piece to anticipate the time I'll pick it up.<//text>

This review is for service, quality and customer service. It is a pickup or delivery only. No dine in   I’ve ordered pizzas here before and it’s consistently efficient, quick, great tasting and customer service is always great. The staff seems to work well together and help each other on especially busy nights. Even when super busy they are kind and courteous to customers.</Text>

<Text>The best, affordable quality! only in Watsonville, CA. if you can afford $40 pizzas, then obviously you'll get what you pay for "if its in your budget". yes, mistakes can happen just like anywhere but they always make it right in this location. hope this helps</Text>< resp>

After about 10 minutes in the store, and 20 after I ordered, I noticed they seemed to have an issue, with casual glances towards me.  My app said the pizza was ready.   Finally, I ask if there’s an issue with my order.  After a few of the employees looked around, one finally spoke up and said the hadn’t made it yet!

They offered me some wings or cheesy bread, but I’ll pass.  I just to have my pizza ready when it supposed to be.< /text><gmap_id>0x808e1b23c53366f5:0x5ddf0f0e6ff7181c<//gmap_id>< pictures>

<Review>I have received pizza from this location for different times in the last 2 months and now they will no longer deliver here at 4.7 miles away. I spoke directly with the  Manager and she told me it must have been a mistake. She refused to take my order or delivery. This is unacceptable and now I will order from a local business or Pizza Hut .< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I hate leaving bad reviews. Ive worked these jobs, ive been there, i know it can be hard... but this is the third time ive ordered from this location and gotten it over an hour later. Worse yet, tonight, the pizza tracker informed me if was finishes in20 minutes, on the double check stage. After another 20 minutes, i called in and was informed they were waiting for the driver to return. Alright, thats fine. "Your pizza is on the heat rack" again... fine. Until its an hour and a half after i ordered and the pizza gets here...after sitting under the heat rack for an hour. This pizza tasted like it was a day old. Grease was soaked into the bread. It was chewy, the cheese was solid, and it was barely warm. They didnt think once that after sitting for over an HOUR that they should make a fresh pair of pizzas? This is rediculous and disgusting. At least i cashed in my free pizza for one of them. No more dominos for me<//Review>

Pros:
This Dominos Location still offers the legendary special 2-topping 2-medium pizzas for $5.99 each pizza, but you must tell them about the deal otherwise they will not inform you of it. The average time to have a pizza ready from here takes about 15 minutes not including delivery.

Cons:
There are no restrooms, no tables, no free parking, sometimes no ;lates/napkins/cups...</Text>

Worst place to order anything! Don't even try. They took more than 45 min to just say that their gps didn't recognize my address (i live on one of the most known streets). Then they said that they called to see where I lived but i never received any type of call.I went online to check only to know that "i had received my order". never ordering from there again. I thought after happening before a couple of times it wouldn't happen again but I was wrong. Don't waste your time< /review>

I placed an order for delivery.  It was a medium pepperoni pizza, and it took about 2 hours for them to deliver.  I could've made a whole meal in that time.<//Review>

Horrible customer service! Manager on duty is very un professional and rude! His staff is following in the footsteps of him, their supervisor who use to manage the facility has not passed down his customer service skills. This is the second time dealing with this rude manager and will never shop at this dominos again! And not at any domino's location again!< /Review>

2 hours delivery if your ordering from here and have to have it delivered order 2 hours  before you get hungry.

To the business if your so busy that it takes 2 hours to deliver a pizza than you need to hire more drivers. Business 101</Review>

< Review>
I have to admit, I've only actually ordered one thing here so far, the tofu pad thai. But I have eaten at this restaurant several times, and I really like the food. Atmosphere is kind of generic big Asian restaurant, but it's a very convenient location. It's one of the best Thai restaurants in the area.<//Review>

<text>I come here all the time. I absolutely love the food. Come or order from here if you want Thai comfort food and a place to relax. They renovated in the last few years - new chairs, tabletops. It looks great. They have space for anything from casual night out with a cute someone to large groups. Their desserts are incredibly underrated, don't forget about them! Maybe I'll have them again tonight..</text><name>Kitty Love<//name><user>100200333687596506238< /user>< Resp>

The chicken pan fried noodles were delicious, and the portion was huge! I ate half and brought the rest home. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Nice to eat inside on a cold night.</Text>

Ordered last night on doordash. I had the green curry with shrimp. The shrimp was twice cooked. Obviously they blanch the shrimp and then add it to the order. The shrimp was way over cooked mush. Doordash driver didn't follow instructions to hand me the order. She left my food on the doorstep and never knocked on the door. Never again.< /review>

It had a really funky flavor (it was a side to the chicken, but tasted like it was made with bad fish.  The chicken was overcooked. Didn't think there was such a thing as bad thai food.  Never again.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The Food is off the hook, very tasty, great portions to share, the establishment is clean and they only hung up on me once! Ordered take out, food was hot and ready when I arrived. A little disappointed to only find two shrimp in the chicken & Shrimp fried rice but after one bite I found that the chicken and sausage in the dish along with the shrimp was very filling. We also had the Pad Thai noodles and Angel Wings. All 3 dishes were delish and plentiful for 2 adults and two children to feast on and I have left overs for lunch! bonus.</Text>

And the Employee said we can cancel the rice.
I don’t recommend this place because you will wait for along time. I will never come back.</Review>< Pictures>

Very fresh flavors. And spicy which is good thing if you love spicy food. Like the minty combination too and big portions. Great if you like coming with company that way you can order multiple plates and share them!</Review>

<text>The food in my opinion was average with your typical Thai restaurant. I've definitely had some better Thai before, but overall the experience was great; lots of parking, quick friendly service, nice music, calming atmosphere, and an $8 lunch special (why they don't give you a salad and soup when you take-out boggles my mind!) (Don't you want to encourage people to take-out? it's less work and more profit for a restaurant!)<//text>< pictures>

< review>
We went with a guest of ours on a slow Monday. The server took the order and we ordered one curry mild and one spicy. Our guest went to the register and gave his credit card without our notice as he wished to pay for the food. We found out when my husband went to give his card too.
The food came and the spicy curry was too spicy for us to eat, so we requested the server to modify the curry to little less spicy if she could. She got so mad and started arguing that they cannot do it and it was our fault that we ordered spicy. We had just requested if she could but she was so rude and literally kept arguing even if we said it was okay,we can order other mild one.
10 minutes after the food was on the table, she brought the check without even asking us if we wanted to order any desert or anything else. We felt it was rushed. Again to our greatest surprise there were 4 different bills and when we asked why, she said she kept charging the card as and when we ordered different items??????????? saw it first time in my lifetime the way the bill was broken into 4 parts :(
We expressed our opinion that the it was weird and our overall experience was disappointing and she was rude. On hearing this, the server started arguing on the top of her voice and it was very embarrassing, we called the owner. He said the girl had a bad day so let it go (????????) She was still calling names in Thai language in a very loud and insulting way and kept talking until we left. We have never had such experience even in a road side or smallest restaurant  in our life. Our guest was so shocked ! the bitter experience will always remain in our hearts.this place has to have lowest grade despite how good the food is.< /review>

I love their Spicy noodles and the flavor is just perfect. Their pineapple fried rice can have more pineapple and more spice, but that doesn't take away any star. This is a fast service,  good quality food restaurant with ample seating and a good ambience. Recommended to anyone for authentic Thai food< /Review>

Easily my favorite Thai restaurant, and I've only eaten there once.  Atmosphere is comfortable and quiet. Service was quick and very friendly.   Best of all, the food was superb (which is not a word I often use).

I had the Panang Curry, and it was hands down the best curry I've ever had.  It was well presented, and it was obvious that the cook took no short-cuts when preparing it. It was also refreshingly spicy unlike other restaurants which seem to have a spice scale of  Milk -> Yogurt. Its not enough to make you burn, but it was a nice kick.

Prices are about average when compared to other Thai restaurants in the area, but considering the above, id say its a bargain.<//Text>

More than enough food for the prices!! Delicious and I would love to come again!! I got the chicken chow mein. I ordered a side of rice to go with my chow mein, but by the time I finished the plate, I had no room for rice.</Text>

This place is really hit and miss.  Somethings are pretty good, while others are just awful.  Green curry is usually my favorite Thai dish, but this place is all sorts of yuk!  The crispy catfish with curry (red) is delicious, though.  So if you know what to order, you might be happy. If you're looking for a place that will be great no matter what you order, this isn't it.</text>

New owner. Lots of thugs come here lately. Stay away or you might get hurt. Food is getting expensive and not as good as a few years ago. It used to be inexpensive and tasty. Not so much any more.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Sat at table forever. Wait staff says hello and thank you but seems very lacadasical with an assumptive attitude that customers will keep coming back despite poor service. After 5 minutes, I had to walk to counter to ask if we could order. Later during the meal, I had to ask for another water. The service is subpar as waiters DO NOT anticipate and or care about guest needs. The food was okay kind of bland. Won't be back.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dd28a80d3694db:0x1856a806dae34dd7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

So I've been coming to this restaurant for about 3yrs now, I haven't been here in about 6 months. So my friend and I came tonight and for the first time I  can say I did not enjoy the food and certainly not one of the servers that was there. The food was absolutely not what it used to be I just about get the same food everytime. Cream cheese wontons, fish cake for an appetizer and had Spicy Coconut Soup, Pad Thai  Noodles and for the 1st time tried Spicy Chicken and Shrimp with Green Beans with a Thai Tea. Literally the only things that tasted the same was the Thai Tea and the Thai Noodles that's it. To top it off one of the new server was being rude for no apparent reason, which I called her out on her attitude and set her straight real quick because I didn't appreciate her tone of voice and her attitude. "Everytime" my friends and I come we spent no less then $100 so we definitely won't be coming back here again. To the restaurant owners "Best of luck next time on hiring a new server, you loose her 👎 before you loose more customers, just a thought."<//review>

this place has gone down....the papaya salad's dressing was just plain vinegar, I never had such a bad papaya salad, even myself can make a better one. The quantity is cut in half, you pay for a child's portion now...
if you love Thai food, this place is not for you...tastes like it's catered to people who never had Thai food thus would not know any better. Very disappointed... almost insulted they think their food is authentic. You should go to Jumpathai( Brookhurst and Chapman), you  will know what Thai food is supposed to taste like.  I had to give  a star to post this review.</review>

<Review>The fried trout with little mango strips/sauce cost about $19 and some change and was served without rice.  Rice was side order and cost $1.50 for 2 cups.  With soup, it cost me a total of $39 and some change with $6 tip.    Expensive!< /Review><Name>Bernard Alegre<//Name><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dd28a80d3694db:0x1856a806dae34dd7</gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

i complained that their food was not spicy enough. When i went back they remembered me and i told them to use fresh thai chili not red flakes. They used only flakes, servered the rice much after the other food, did not give us water, thats right not once in the meal even after the water guy went by and noticed we didnt have any.  better thai up the street< /Review>

Our visit at the AT&T Trinity Parkway store with Asia was exceptional.  My husband and I did phone upgrades. Asia took the time to show us different phones and answered our many questions. She took the time to walk us through transferring our data from our old phones too. Asia provides exceptional customer service.<//review>

<text>I must take the time and tell you what an awesome experience I had yesterday. I was able to purchase a new phone and have all of my needs taken care of in 30 minutes.  And that included transferring all of my contacts and all of my pictures onto my new device.Oh ....and did I mention that my phone bill was lowered without me even asking. ❤️ Cliff Went above and beyond to see that I was taken care of.  I have been a loyal customer to Trinity Parkway, AT&T and I will continue to do All of my business with them.<//text><userid>105008281485701379519<//userid><Time>1593556983268<//Time>< name>

I believe their names were Brandon and Michelle. They gave the most excellent customer service from start to finish!!!  I was more than pleased and I'm glad I chose that location. Thanks again Brandon & Michelle!!! You're very knowledgeable employees. You were able to resolve the issue that I came into the store for and I left more than satisfied. Thank you

I'm definitely giving this store location 5 stars!!!!< /text>

We thought we had great services, till we received our bill and been dealing with customer Ser. Agent lied and mislead consumer and now the customer services do not want to honor agreement . Should have listen to wife and wrk to Verizon.

Left sprint  and ATT is worse . We will try corporate and if they don’t honoree we are dropping off phones. Due to ATT not honoring those own agreement we signed up on ..

I was purchasing more data because a week ago, when I initially purchased my plan, I was told that if you run out of data for your hotspot, your service slows down, but does not stop, which was an outright lie, it does stop completely.

Isn't it funny how working with almost any communications company (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.) makes you not want to talk to any people ever again?</Review><GmapID>0x809009758dfee213:0x5126754ed2cfd0f1< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I am at the store asking to exchange the phone for a new one (reminder... this one is less than 2 days old). They refuse stating that a) Apple requires them to have me drive to the Apple Store 40 min away, and b) This is AT&T policy.
I called Apple Care got a manager on the line and he said the store should exchange the phone. They refused.
I called a manager for AT&T and he said they should exchange the phone (a real AT&T Store would, the phone is TWO DAYS old!) They still refuse.
Both Apple and AT&T said they would exchange if I purchased the phone from them. Apparently it’s just this store’s policy to not stand by the products they sell.< /text>< Pics>

I had gone to three other locations to get help but they all had no interest in helping me. Brandon on the other hand took the time to fix my issue and I greatly appreciate his efforts and he deserves praise. I was about to switch carriers but I will remain an AT&T customer because of the service he provided me with today. Thank you!!</Review>< Response>

< Review>
I always feel like I'm being ripped off here. The service on the faster side compared to other places but the prices are awful. The oil change I needed at Pep Boys and Just Tires was 39.99 and 38.99. This same service cost 69.99 at this awful shop. I felt the employees were unprofessional and I was being scammed. They had a sign that advertised "price matching" but I received only 18 dollars off of their normal price. Jiffylube often has coupons for 15 off oil changes so I only ended with a 3 dollar discount when that's taken into account. The same services cost more at this awful brand. I have always had poor experiences with jiffy lube. I will stick to pep boys or just tires. Hate this company and hate the service.< /Review>

I got my oil changed here yesterday and had a great experience! The technicians were so nice, very helpful, and super efficient. I was in and out in 20 minutes. I also didn't have to leave my car so that made things super convenient. I'll definitely be back!< /Text>

I went in on Friday in the afternoon and was surprised it wasn't busy, they serviced my car quickly and all while I stayed in my car (which I loved). They even wiped down my windshield which was nice of them and they kept updating me with the status of my car and when they would finish. The oil change cost $69.99 but with my coupon it was reduced to $54.66 Thanks guys for your help! Maybe next time I won't wait too long getting an oil change now that I won't dread the experience! :)</Review>

The team handling my oil change and radiator flush were professional, efficient and courteous. The Covid-19 precautions were followed - the service was performed all while I stayed in my car - and all services were performed much quicker than expected. Thanks guys!< /Text>

They got me in right away so it was quick. They let me know I needed to change my filters but I declined. Didnt get much enthusiasm from anyone when I came in. There was one person who was nice enough to greet me kindly on the way out. Also, the person who attended my car had left smeard oil on my driver side door and handle.</Review>

< review>
Best Jiffy experience I’ve ever had and I’ve been with the company for years. I’m from the Midwest and I went to the other jiffy down the road and they told me they couldn’t get a oil plug off because it was stripped. These guys here took a look at it, got it off, gave me oil, and then explained what I had to do next. Definitely saved me a bunch of time and money today. They hit my tires, checked all fuel levels and vacuumed my carpets. Had me in n out in 15. Best service I’ve ever had.< /review>

Really really nice guys working here. Got my oil changed and tires rotated crazy fast, which is much appreciated because my to-do list today is longer than my patience or attention span usually allows. Jose was great - super nice, explained things without making me feel stupid, and even helped me with my e-brake when I couldn't figure it out because I'm an idiot. Thank you Jose! You're wonderful!< /Text>

I advise anyone who is considering this specific establishment to reconsider. We recently had a new Marine check into our unit, and stopped into this Jiffy lube to get the oil changed in his car. The next day we discovered that his car had been leaking oil over night. The Marines car turned off on the way to work in the morning and we had to have it towed to the local Volkswagen dealer. The service department was able to identify the leak coming from the oil filter housing assembly. It was broken when the filter was replaced and was over torqued causing the assembly to break and begin to leak oil. When the Marine was at this Jiffy Lube for the oil change the mechanic, after speaking with the Marine said he wanted to offer the Marine a "hook up" and only charged him 40 dollars so that he would not have to give him a receipt. The Marine is not originally from the state's and was taken advantage of by this establishment. They did not offer him a receipt for the "under the table job" as they referred to it,  and will not assume responsibility for the damage. I will be assisting the Marine in filing a consumer affairs report to the state of CA for the fraudulent service they performed since they have decided not to take responsibility. Always get your receipt as these are poorly qualified technicians that can not even avoid over tightening a oil filter.< /Review>

"Jiffy Lube", my foot!

These oil stains forced me to wait 2 HOURS as they left my car in the bay, doing nothing. They were not busy, it wasn't lunch time, yet I'm forced to wait in a dirty, foul smelling lounge with nothing but bad coffee to drink.

The one armed bandit of a technician (he literally only had one arm) said I had to have a part replaced. I told him I didn't want it replaced, and he said "Well then I won't work on your car then, that part is cracked!" So I said he could replace it. He uses strong arm tactics to bully me and blackmail me, then he makes me wait 2 hours in retaliation.

After getting my car, later that week I took it to a local mechanic for a second opinion (he was back from his vacation), and my mechanic, whom I can trust and I wish I had gone to in the first place but he was on vacation at the time, said that the part the technician told me he had to replace was not only never replaced, it was never cracked in the first place, and yet I was billed for a part and the labor for replacement of said part that I never received, no part was installed to replace and no labor for it ever happened, yet there it was on my bill.

Total ripoff!

Stay away from this clip joint! I hate these guys! I hope this place goes under.< /review>

They put too much oil in my engine. As a result, something blew and the oil got ALL OVER MY ENGINE COMPARTMENT. The top blew off of something, and made a mess of the whole thing. I'm not a mechanic, but a mechanic friend of mine told me that the pressure was too hugh, they had over filled the oil compartment, and as a result it blew and ruined my engine.

What kind of morons do they have working here!?  I called to complain, and they gave me an attitude, cursed at me, and hung up on me.

From now on, I use my mechanic friend to handle my oil change needs. I would have gone to him that day, but he had a line a mile long for his services (that shows that he's legit/good). This place though...never again. No Jiffy Lube anywhere, ever again for me.</review>< date>

Came here for an oil change a while ago. I normally get it done at the one near my house, but i was in the area waiting to pick up my gf. Thought iI would get an errand done while I was waiting.

Everything was fine, but Im docking off 2 stars just because I had clearly told them I did NOT wait to change my air filter, but they did it anyway. I didn't want to argue over it since it was already done. But I am sure its what they were expecting anyway. Not cool.<//Text>

False promises to get your money. I give this particular location a poor rating for a reason. Yesterday, I set out to find a place to get an oil change. I was driving through Pasadena on Walnut when I came across Jiffy Lube. I immediately pulled my car in and asked how long for an oil change? The technician said 15 minutes and I asked how much he said $49 and I was quoted $29 from a Mobil station closer to home. I asked the Jiffy Lube tech why $49 his reply was that they would change the oil, filter and check the tire pressure on all my tires and all my fluids plus vacuum the inside of my car which needed it at the time. So I agreed to the $49 price because of the extras. When my car was ready about 25 minutes later I opened my door and it was obvious that no vacuum touched anyhere in my car as a matter of fact it looked worse! I flagged the technician down and pointed to the passenger seat which had crumbs on it and said to him, "I thought you guys were going to vacuum the car?" The tech said, "we did" "why are there still bits of crumbs and leaves in the car?" I replied he then said, "Oh you want me to vacuum the seat? Ok hold on" he said. He took another 7 mins to drag a shop vac over and vacuum the seat really quick and then  said " there you go" and he walked away. I was already late to meet a client by now thanks to them and I had to go. I'm now in the process of filing a complaint with the BBB because they picked the wrong customer to toy with little do they know. I do undisclosed mystery shops and audits for corporations that hire my company to check on their own company operations and employees. As to the aforementioned experienced I encountered at this location I do not recommend you go to this location find another. With that being said not all Jiffy Lubes are the same just this location, its customer service was very poorly executed.</Review>

Everything would have been fine if I could trust they did what they said they did on the receipt.  I know for a fact they never checked my tire pressure, because I watched.  I'm pretty sure they replaced my oil filter, but who knows if it was a new unused one???  They did not report anything about my low brake fluid either.  If they say they do stuff that they 100% did not do, then how can they be trusted for anything they do, especially since they've been busted many times ay many different locations for doing horrible things like not changing the oil filters, Etc...</Text>

<Review>Gotta keep an eye on these guys. They're fast but not thorough or careful. The last two times I have been here, they left the oil pan bolt loose and it fell off. They don't really clean the windows very well at all anymore. The window washing fluid is never topped off. Their signature service has fallen off or the air filter cover was not fastened back on. They do take their own coupons though without much hesitation unlike the bitterness and resistence they used to exhibit. The staff always, always, always tries to upsell you some service or product other than what you came in for. They're fast and convenient though still. Which I appreciate enough to return and put up with some of their shortcomings.</Review>< pictures>

You know, the one where they top off all your fluids/check your tires, etc. Part of the reason I went was because my power steering fluid was empty and one tire was low. I got home and popped my hood, sure enough, power steering fluid compartment bone dry and my tire was still low. I looked at the paper that details the service, "power steering fluid - full". What a joke. Go somewhere else.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The only reason I went was because I desperately needed an oil change and the nearby Honda dealership was closed. Right away they started with the up sale saying they thought they heard me ask for a cabin filter in addition to my oil change and tried to charge me a hundred bucks for it. Then they told me they only had synthetic oil for my car and that it would be $96 for an oil change. I said screw that in my car back and they said oh actually we have a synthetic blend we can use for you and it's only $74. Like I said I desperately needed an oil change so I had no choice so I let them gauge me for a $74 oil change. Never again!</Review>

Google "jiffy lube scam". We have serviced our cars here for almost twenty years, but no longer. My car broke down on freeway, putting my family's life at risk, had it towed to dealership. Turns out jiffy had installed engine air filter backwards the week before, the cause for breakdown. Manager never called me after three attempts to contact. Took matter to regional office. Worse, they equivocated and refused to take responsibility and compensate for the mere $245 repair fees. Guess they won't miss the $160 they get from us per year.< /Text>

Good for simple things like an oil change, but if they want to "flush" anything then you're better off taking your car to a trusted mechanic.< /Text>

<Text>I live literally RIGHT around the corner from this location and I am never coming here again. I have gone 3 or 4 times since moving there because it was so convenient and I could walk home while they were doing work, but I'm not convinced that they are doing anything. They completely took advantage of my wife last time she went in and over-billed her enormously and they constantly lie and try to upset you. I know that is "just part of the car repair business," but these guys take it too far. Ironically, there is a FAR better JL location down on Colorado that is now getting my business. I'm sure they did some shady shizz to, but thus far they have been a vast improvement over these scoundrels.</Text>< pics>

<review>Stopped here twice in one weekend.  Always our go to place when we are heading up to Badger Flat to go horseback riding in the mountains.  The only thing I had an issue with is that it didn't seem all that busy but took a bit for our food to arrive.  Otherwise, if you are ever in Shaver Lake you have to stop here.</review>< pics>

Food was ok but the service was terrible.  Had enough customers for 1 waitress and still couldn't keep up with 2. The one waitress couldn't get orders correctly and was huffing and puffing at ever request. Younger waitress finally came in to help and ran circles around the other two.< /review>

This is the place to go to purchase some meat to make tacos at home.  Or simply a place to buy some meat from a meat market!  Tortillas, chips, salsas and guacamole available.  Great place to go for quick and easy weekday or weekend meal!</Text>

Quality meats and a variety of other products. The meats are really fresh and the staff will help you with your questions so that you buy exactly what you need. I look forward to celebrating a proper barbeque with their product once covid allows it!<//Review>

If anything avoid ordering past 7pm because it gets so busy. Walk up window is open until 6pm if you want to avoid the line. Food is still good and staff is friendly. Let me express that their is no restroom access if you’re traveling. Plenty of parking if you’re taking a break for all vehicles except 18 wheelers.</Review>< pictures>

The food came out good . There is a children's play area and the restrooms were clean. The staff were so well organized, kudos to their training and manager. Overall, I would recommend this McDonald's, you'll have a Happy Meal.< /Review>

<text>Used the app to place an order.  When I arrived at this location I could not get to the curbside pickup spots.  The drive thru has a barrier to direct traffic but this makes the drive thru the only lane on the back of the restaurant.  Other than that my order was correct and food is on par with my expectations of McDonald's.</text><user>108661088604662466566<//user><gmapID>0x80db43e42b4a64a9:0xae5c53b0bee8566b< /gmapID>< username>

This McDonald branch started to charged almost everything now since the pandemic started. They used to give out free sauces etc. Now even extra pump of hazelnut or vanilla creamer and extra sauce they charged it. Just saying. Staff are nice.< /review>

So went to McDonald’s drive thru and only got half the order.Makes you mad when you get home and find only part of a order, pain to have to dive back down there again. How hard is it to put the order in the bag. Very disappointed!!</Review>

There are many times that they just serve you something as simple as coffee like slop.  Coffee drips everyone because of the way they serve it.  We go on vacation to Estes Park,. Colorado every year, while the wait is long, they never serve their coffee like the one in menifee does. My brother-in-law even said that they served him his coffee with the lid not on all the way. If I could give zero stars I would.< /Review>< Pictures>

Worst experience ever from McDonald's went to drive through ordered about $45 of  food which was was not a lot of food get part of my order looking bag my order was wrong and what I wait 20 minutes for is 8 hash browns so they're my regional part of the order is cold then I tell them they shorted me my eggs for my Deluxe big breakfast they say it says on the receipt no egg but a deluxe big breakfast with egg is 5.59 without egg is still 5.59 so I wind up going through the drive-through to get another Deluxe big breakfast cuz it was cold from the beginning I asked what the manager's name was she says he can't give me that information get my food and I asked what the store manager's name is she says I can't give you that information<//Review>

Google said they were open and the door said the open at 6am, but we were told they wouldn’t open until 7am. We were in an RV so we couldn’t go through the drive thru, which was open.< /Review>

One of the busiest McDonald's in the area. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The food came out good but since they were very busy, they filled the order wrong. The place has several kiosk order screens that made ordering a convenience if you didn't want to wait in line. There is a children's play area and the restrooms were clean. The staff were so well organized, kudos to their training and manager. Overall, I would recommend this McDonald's, you'll have a Happy Meal.< /text>

<text>Wow!! Very unorganized. Don’t bother with the walk up window. We had a simple order of one happy meal and fries and we waited for a good 20 minutes LONGER than what we would have had we just waited in the long drive thru lane! (Saw the car that was behind us before we pulled out of the drive through, drive away as we stood outside in the heat at the walk up window!) Then..... on top of that my husband had to run around the other side of the building because they accidentally walked out to the car waiting spot FOR THE DRIVE THRU!!! Absolutely awful.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Cheap food equals cheap service, cashier didn’t know how to put in my order, forgot my ranch with my food, so since I didn’t want to deal with her I went back to my car and ordered on the app and still they couldn’t get that right. Gave me a hot coffee when I ordered an iced coffee THROUGH THE APP. I said screw this and didn’t want to have them fix it cause they’d end up probably spitting in my drink. This McDonalds sucks<//Text></record>

Normally I wouldn’t leave a review for a McDonald’s since there are just so many of them. But this one I will leave a review for. I was there on a very busy day and they got my order wrong (an honest mistake) but the manager came to our table and made it right and even went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. I didn’t see a name tag cause it was a rainy cold day and she had a knit style sweater. But she didn’t have to go that far with making right. Very much appreciated manager lady, wish I would have caught your name to give you proper kudos on here.<//text>

Have not gone to a McDonald's here in Banning for awhile and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at what good friendly service my granddaughter and I received. All the employees seem to actually enjoy their job they were all smiling very helpful and friendly.  made us feel happy and that helped us to enjoy our meal. The place was very clean and the worker we're very attentive. And not a wine had a bad attitude Thank you again and I Did give the manner a thumbs up.<//Review>

<text>I was in the area, so stopped by to check out the vintage decor and architecture. Was definitely a pretty cool experience (a blast in the past feel). The preserved portion of the restaurant seemed a bit dim. It was like an abandoned museum of sorts. They should use better lighting at night and keep preserving the 50's style and feel, it could use more flare.</text>< pictures>

You know McDonald's, is not healthy and everyone knows it but many items of the menu tastes good. I recommend the breakfast menu and chicken nuggets.< /Review>

First, need more and bigger "no smoking" signs on their patio
Second, because they do NOT have power outlets in the DINING ROOM, they are NOT in compliance with ADA.
If someone can NOT charge their cell phones, how are they going to CHARGE a WHEELCHAIR?
As far as truck and RV parking, they have plenty of room and this place is extremely easy to spot both in traffic and from the freeway< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Food was good EXCEPT for the fries, they were hot but tasted stale and lacked salt. Also ordered food to eat there but they bagged all the orders to go and refused to call out the table marker numbers which kinda added to the confusion on whether they wanted us to leave or actually eat there</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Went threw the drive thru. They got my order wrong. I ordered 2 Big MAC meals,  they tried to give me Quarter Pounder meals. I'm glad I looked at my receipt. When I brought it to their attention they gave me cold fries, and cold Big Macs with NO BIG MAC SAUCE! $20 for 2 meals and this is what happens! I will not be going back. I get better service and better food from Del Taco right next door. Soda was flat and the Iced tea tasted like it's been sitting for days. McDonald's sucks!!! I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!!< /Review>< user_id>

<text>Just stopped by for a quick breakfast on the go. I ordered your fruit and maple oatmeal. My favorite. The apples were bad. They tasted really sour and there was a slimy texture to them. I didn't get a freaking spoon either. I was already too far away to turn back. I recommend you go through your packs of Apple bits 🤮🤮🤮🤮</text>< pics>

Great place for quick food, and convenience.  Service was backed up, but the handled it! Order was checked by them, in front of me, so no ugly surprises, with missing items! Food was fresh, hot and tasty!!!<//review>

Worst morning MCDONALD experience. Too many customers and not enough management - lots of workers running around dealing with customers with the loudest mouth. End result - couldn't handle orders or customers expectations. Waited over 20mins and then got my money refunded. Was not worth the wait or the money.<//Review>

Too far to drive back before noticed with kids in vehicle. McDonalds has to be the worst fast food and is only used as a last resort and kids no no better. We will no longer support this establishment or any other McD facilities as quality has been worse than ever, not to say they were ever great however recent experiences have influenced a ban on the Ronald. 1/16 star rating if available.</text>< Pictures>

It is very busy.  Was told to use the kiosk to order,  however I could not customize my order. When we explained it to the manager she was quite rude. I would really like to have sausage gravy and biscuits, which you don't have here.  I'm from the Midwest where we have it😥< /Text>

<review>I’m giving 5 stars because of my experience last night! I went through the drive thru and ordered four cheeseburgers but instead called them Krabby Patties. The girl who took my order went along with my Spongebob reference and asked if I wanted a kelp shake or a kelp fry with my krabby patties. I just appreciated that she went along with my nonsense, so thank you Rosie for making my night!</review>< pictures>

<Review>A few oddities this time but still received great service. Tried to get a double smokehouse bbq burger and the associate said it "was not available" I questioned that because all it is is an additional party. Anyways, he put it in as a custom order. I ordered the meal and I got my drink cup but when the meal came, there were no fries. I asked about it but noticed I wasn't charged for a meal. I gave the associate my receipt and he told me he'd get me the fries. I had gotten the drinks before I got my burger so I knew I had asked for a meal. The associate was really friendly and apologetic and I got the drinks and fries for free. 3 star establishment, 5 star employee. Thanks Carlos!</Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This is TERRIBLE store, as a retired Manger, from South Carolina our store was, and is a Cooperate Store. Time Goals were set and meet. Cleanliness was always keep in he Bathroom and Dining area. for Breakfast, there were always a lead Crew Person, or Ast. Mgr. making Dining room checks, while pouring Coffee, or water, while asking the patrons how there how is there services.    I still remember, to TRY to meet, and serve the customer in less than a min. (60), in the Dinning area while window sales under 2min, (120 sec) There is no since of  URGENCY !!! TO SERVE THE CUSTOMER. without them there is no Store.
An if this is a Franchise Store then In my opinion, your doing a disservices by the standards that were set in Head Quarters in Illinois.
I love the food, Ill continent to eat there, sparingly, with great trepidation.< /review>

during the afternoon they are great. good service and fresh food. evening time not so much and they take forever to get your food ready. it's worse if you go at like 2am. there's been numerous times at 2am where I bought chicken nuggets and they were cold and kinda hard.< /Review>

By the time I was given the sauce, my burger and fries was cold.  Only in Banning store will you find poor service. We always hope that things would change but I think I'll be done after waiting for years now. When looking at Beaumont and Cabazon Stores their service is clean, fast and food always taste hot and fresh. I personally recommend just going outside Banning to get quality service and a hot meal for the money.<//text>< pictures>

Why is it so difficult to have two cheeseburgers with lettece, tomatoe, mayo only? ??? We had pickles & onions and it was $14.00!!! I guess it was a superior that redid the burgers and refunded us $!!! OMG-WHY I NEVER LIKE FAST FOOD & BECUZ I USUALLY DONT FEEL WELL AFTERWARDS. I try to avoid fast food whenever possible..and geez...could eat a steak for those prices! OMG NOPE NOT GOOD AT ALL!❗< /review>

Only good thing about this McDonald's, is that they have free mini icecream cones. Legit. Customers; like myself had to deal with rude staff, they feel free to say whatever they want; l  unnecessary rude comments that isn't needed or wanted while ordering the food. Also, The manager is one unprofessional female that doesn't care for her own customers satisfaction, she was upset that the food was cold after sitting on the counter for approximately 15 minutes. Was very loud about it. Then here is additional fact to this place,  Bathroom is disgusting, the employees put the toilet rolls on the floor to use. This is the worst McDonald's I ever been at . Lucky enough to even get 2 stars for the free ice cream cones.</Review>

<review>What happened to this place ? I walked in and ordered 1 burger  a drink and it took 45 min...
I'm serious , the soft drink machine wasn't working , no ice tea ,  the manager was running around the place with a pipewrench in her hand..I couldn't believe this place..when I finally received my burger the bun was hard . .this place really needs help from corporate , they could do a lot better with a group of monkeys from a zoo..</review><time>1551143198391</time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

Food is properly prepared, however, my scrambled eggs were not fully cooked (runny).  The exterior trash cans are overflowing and the overall cleanliness is below average.  Great quick stop on the way to work for a hot breakfast.< /Text>

< review>
This McDonald's charges higher than surrounding areas. I ordered a bacon and cheese sandwich meal and the price was 7.21 compared to 5.92 at cabazon and calimesa. The employee stated that all McDonald's charge different prices and its bcuz the area was busy and off the freeway, which makes no sense...sandwich was rubbery as if it had been microwaved...I will NOT be going back<//review>

Dirty. Smells like pee. Lots of homeless in this area 😢. Force you to use a kiosk to order. People crowded around waiting to pick up their orders. Hot and muggy. On the plus side, i got lucky and my fries were hot.< /text>

Don't waste your time... Go down the road to the next McDonalds. There was a huge line in the drive thru.  It was not moving.  Get it off line, go inside to find another huge line with one cashier taking orders.  One guy told me he had been waiting over 15 min for his m meal.  I'm sorry this is a McDonalds.  It is BS to have to wait more an a couple min for this kind of food.  Left and went down the road to Del Taco.  In and out.  Done<//text>

The best thing they have done is serve breakfast all day. The young lady at the window was very nice and efficient. We visited again. We used the kiosk to order and pay. We waited almost 30 minutes. My grandson went to the counter and asked if our order was ready. He was told they never got it. He gave them the receipt. When our order finally arrived it was in a bag. We ordered eat in. I was told they were out of hashbrowns. Not a problem. However, we ordered 1 small fry and 1 medium. They just brought the medium. Two smoothies were ordered, 1 strawberry banana and 1 mango. Both smoothies were mango, not what we ordered. They were also not filled to the line but about a half inch below the fill line.  When our order was finally brought to us we were told the number was called out but we did not hear it . At any other McDonald's when a number is on the table it is brought to the table. All trash barrels were overflowing and being ignored by all employees. It was not that crowded that it could not be emptied.  I will not go to this store again.<//review>

<review>Stood in line to order  for over 5 minutes while the Manager spoke to employees. There were 3 patrons behind me waiting to be helped as well.
I asked to speak to the Manager, she identified herself and asked if I had been helped.  There were 4 patrons waiting in line to be helped and you look at us and ignore us.  She yelled at an employee and told her to get on a register.   Poor management skills, restaurant was dirty.  Very unhappy with that McDonald's!< /review>< userid>

Ive been going to this mcdonalds for years its always been great. Today is the first time it wasnt i paid in the Kiost Machine and it didn't give me a receite. I had special orders and it didnt provide me with those specific orders. I am very dissapointed that not only that. But the frys had very bad taste they were either not salted, or over cooked. The meat was a little pink. And When i had left I also got a stomach ache I shouldnt be gettign stomach aches from a place that i always eat. Im very dissapointed! There were also no condimits. I got up about 4 to 6 times to have my meal corrected.</Text>

I ordered at the kiosk and I waited in line just to have an old lady be really mad at me for no reason. The old lady was the manager at the McDonald's location I was at. Then the same old lady kicked all of us teenagers out. I had no time to eat. I just wanted to enjoy my food after I had a competition and didn't eat since 2 PM. You should employ better people. This kind of attitude is unacceptable. I feel really ashamed of this fast food restaurant. Palm Springs and other desert locations do a better job than this.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A little dirty, but I continued in the line to order anyway. Food and coffee was overall good. But honestly, because of the lack of better cleanliness, I will plan to stop somewhere else the next time I'm driving through. 3 stars for food, 1 star for cleanliness; 2 stars overall.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Bad service, waited at the window for a few mins then told to pull over to the waiting area where there was already another car waiting. It took them 18 mins to bring me my order and the frys were half cooked and soggy. I would go to mc d's on 2nd street they are quick to get you your food<//Review>

It's a great place to fast charger your electric car, and the indoor playground is clean-ish. The coffee is passable too. I don't go here to eat however, so there's that.< /Text>

Came here for a quick bite on the way to Joshua Tree. The staff was very friendly and upgraded my small fries to a large because he felt it took a long time to get the food, but I don't think I was waiting for more the 5-8 minutes, which I actually thought was pretty reasonable for the amount of people in line and in the drive thru. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area again. Thanks McDonalds!</Review>

Used the kiosk & received food quickly. However, I had to go ask for a cup. The beverage area was messy & almost out of straws. Dirty tables, quite a few people behind the counter, 1 person on register & a line to the door.< /Text>

<Review>Service was EXTREMELY  SLOW. The staff that were working were apathetic   to their customers. No one seemed to have a sense of urgency  to get any order complete. I only ordered  donut sticks & an ice coffee. The customer  before me only ordered coffee. His order took at least 5 - 7 min. My husband was waiting  for me. He said I took between 12 - 15 minutes. I placed  my order @ 542 am.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

< Review>
Very clean and the staff there were friendly, especially Rosie and Cameron. The was food was consistantly good for what we come to expect from McDonald's. This place is comonly visited by homless individuals. That being said, the parking lot is big and its easy to access from the street. This place also has a play area for the kids. I just hope they turn down the AC in that area. It was way too cold to enjoy your food there. Have a great time. Blessings!!< /Review>

I bought 1 large soda-$1.08. I gave the casbier $10.10. After 3 attempt to give me change- which l repeatedly handed back- told him it was $9.02--l settled at $7.75-said to give me my cup please. He handed me a small water glass. I dont know it he was stoned or stupid--butseveral people watching walked out. Dont they evaluate people before handing them a cash register?</Text>

I watched one person start  filling a drive thru order and another  person finished it and pass it out the window  then the first person came looking for the order with the remaining  food item and was looking everywhere for it it was funny I finally yelled the other girl finished it and another girl passed out the window  this happened more than once each time different persons but the slap stick comedy  was the same you had to laugh when they spent time looking  everywhere going back and forth for the half bagged order. Now once I received my order which was bagged when I was going to eat in i walked over to the  drinks BIG MISTAKE BIG MISTAKE once I stood in front of the drink dispenser I was STUCK TO THE FLOOR BY SOME STICKY UNKNOWN  SUBSTANCE  MY SHOES WERE GLUED THERE. AS I REACHED FOR THE COUNTER TO GIVE ME LEVERAGE TO SET FEET FREE MY HAND WAS OVER TAKEN BY STICKY SLIMM now I was into it feet stuck and my hands in STICKY slim with my free hand I filled my cup with water  and poured it first on my hand then feet and freed  my self.  But the adventure was not over the entire floor from the drink area to the front door was sticky with each step I though I was going to lose my shoe as I carefully made my way to a table I noted it was dirty and by all accounts looked sticky so I decided not to take a chance and sit I took my food and decided to eat in my car BIG DISAPPOINTMENT the food was NOT FRESH OR CORRECT  made the decision not to go back in to risky  the service  was awful the food cold and disappointing I won't  be going back there again unless I want to see a comedy show but I will bring my own food.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

They gave me the wrong burger. I asked for a special order and they gave me an old burger that was stale with all the wrong ingredients, looked like it was for a different  order in Drive thru.</Text>

Horrible as always, not sure why I go to this one. They're slower than molasses going uphill in the winter time no matter what time you go or how many people are in front of you, whether you go inside or through the drive through. If you dont get parked or your order isn't messed up then you're lucky. This one just gives McDonalds a bad name.</review>

I have had to wait 20 min for a #4 med with a cola, with only 2 customers in line. I wouldn't recommend this McDonald's if you are in a rush. However foods always correct and hot.<//Text>

<Review>Employee was rude telling me they dont sale something im looking at on the menu I tried ordering a peppermint iced mocha and he tells me they only have hot ones, but I had purchased one already days before and plus I was looking at it on the menu, so I guess he asked another employee if they do sale them and well apparently they did and so he tells me in a rude voice you want cold or hot like I was telling him iced the whole time,I think he has to study the menu before being at the drive thru window or before telling customers they dont sale something,and he just dont know.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Manager was being rude, disrespectful, and racist towards a group of Hispanic students. She kicked us out because it was “closed” and yelled at one of the students. We were just trying to have a proper meal and she was more worried about her door being open rather than attending her costumers. Please fire her. She’s white and fat and made me feel uncomfortable.</Text>

They definitively need more staff! They were in a chaos situation when we were there on a Sat 10 pm evening.  A man complaining no peco in his burger, while the nice lady worker apologized that she is doing 3 things at a time and her co worker cashier is in break ..... so nobody could help her at the moment ...... god! she was so nice! so patient!< /Text>

<review>We ordered our food to go and decided to eat inside. Thankfully we did because they forgot the fries and bbq sauce from the kids meal. The manager got us a larger order fries to try abd make up for it which we greatly appreciated. On our secind order it took over 10 minutes to get our food with no one else in there and then when they gave it to us they said it would be another 12 minutes for thw apple pies that were part of the order because no one told them they needed to make more. The entire staff seemed like a hot mess. Also the bathrooms were disgusting and poured water out of the handles when you went to flush them.</review><user>110098415828327192419</user>< rating>

This place is either good or completely horrible..
Always having to wait for food that isn’t even fresh 80% of the time and after waiting 20+ minutes to the side the car that pulls up next gets their food at the same time as us..
In the bag, no Ketchup but this time we had napkins when we don’t half the time, the sad thing is we only eat here maybe 3x a month and this is almost always the same type of thing we deal with.
This place is lucky most of the guests are from the freeway and will never return to complain.
In total for this 30+ minutes of waiting we only ordered two McMuffins and four hash browns.
I manage a food venue that sees 2000+ guets per day and is NOT fast food and we still have faster and definitely friendlier service than this place.

After writing this review on the way home about 3 minutes away, I open my muffin and found a hair in it unfortunately, so I went back and spoke to the manager around 3pm and he handled what I was saying very well and apologized and offered my food re made or a refund, I chose the refund and it was issued quickly. Thank you edited from one to three stars for professional manager< /review>

The Playland is completely falling apart and smells like urine something should probably be done about that however they got two stars because they updated everything else even though that's not what needed the update the line is extremely fast at the drive-thru but it's McDonald's foods not great their ice cream however is bomb< /Text>

I hate this Mc Donald's unfortunately it's the only one in our area in Palm Springs. It's always filthy, never give you your right order so you might as well just say "give me a surprise" and it may be what you want finally. Most of the time they don't have Coke or it's terrible, so I don't go there for me my kids might just want a quick burger and we make it through the drive thru ok sometimes with that kind of order. I hope they will get a new staff and caring workers one day soon, hey I will even consider to help with management and staff detail.</text>

The worst customer service ever, it takes 20 -25 minutes for an order to be completed.. our 10 piece glaze was shorted, we got 5 regular pieces, 2 had one side not breaded and 6 nugget size pieces. My husband called when he got home,  spoke to the assistant manager who hung up on my husband three times, because he kept telling her, 'I did not order fries'.

I called Corporate to complain, I was told to go back, that a manager would call, that didn't happen.  They did replace my tenders all one piece.  I'm surprised they have received numerous calls for the lines inside and out, the long waits.< /text>

Still a great menu and value pricing and an EV charging station but the remodel and touch screen ordering stations have left very little lobby space.  On busy days a crowd froms and also mistakes can happen in orders.<//Text>

Service was slow mostly because of the high demand and low employees working. I felt bad for them. A lot of customers were upset. However, in my case they had no pies while I had already paid for them. I asked what I could get instead and the employee rudely just told me she didn't care (to let me go on my way) another cashier smiled shyly at me knowing that the other girl had been rude. I got a parfait....instead of two items I had paid for and just left. Didn't feel like adding on pressure to those poor girls.< /Text>

Sucks,  I have never gotten fresh French fries from McDonalds in Mentone,  the closes they have ever come is when I got raw fries,.
Also,  the manager has a scam with the drive-thru,  where they charge you for the more expensive items and give you the cheap items,  and don't give you your receipt,  and if you catch it before you get home,  the manager gets all rude and won't give you the area managers number,<//Text>

< review>
This place was filthy. Crew members did not wear gloves and were handling food. Counters dirty, a "team member had glitter on his face, neck and arms" I personally witnessed one person leaving the prep area, go outside coming back in without washing his hands. I asked for the manager, a young person  looked at me like a deer staring into headlights.
Yes, I did call corporate office that day they were closed so I lk SVT a message and called back two days later, gave a report.
Won't go back.<//review>

Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Went through the drive thru and they charged us for 2 fries we didn't want. We told them and they said to go to the second window. They said they couldn't do anything so we went in. We got our food and literally every single item was wrong. We kept going back and showing them and they were rude and disrespectful and the manager would say "what happened now" when it's completely their fault. They didn't even make their own burger right. In a happy meal we got 6 fries. Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. We weren't the only one, people kept coming in and complaining and one guy waited 10 minutes for a small fry. & they didn't even apologize once.<//Text>

Awful. Everything about this location was terrible. I waited 20 minutes to get a cheeseburger happy meal and a big mac. This wasn't even through the drive thru. The management said ZERO to me, even though I overheard her yell back to the cook to get my remaining big Mac for the lobby as a customer (me) was waiting a super long time. Ugh. Once I got the cheeseburger for my picky eater, I had to wipe off half of the over-abundant amount of ketchup. No apology from any of the staff. I will NOT be going back.< /text>

Horrible experience at this location.  I was never a big fan of McDonald's,  but I was starving so I gave it a chance. Bad service,  disgusting food,  dirty establishment,  manager was yelling,  employees were running around,  pretty chaotic.  Never again.< /Text>

Good to dine in with family. They even take the food to you. The drive thru is kinda terrible...takes longer to be serviced and people try to cut in front of you because drive thru line is on one side but some choose that little corner where they can sneak in front of you to cut you off.< /Text>

I asked for the orange juice that came with the meal when I ordered explicitly to avoid an up charge. They charged me extra for orange juice and lied to my face about it. When I asked the employee, she went to her manager with my receipt. And then her manager told her to tell me that I had ordered that, so basically they said "we don't give a damn". And then when they actually gave me the orange juice, it was a small. I have never in my life been more dissatisfied at a McDonald's of all places. There are plenty locations nearby, do yourself a favor and avoid this one.<//Text>

Huge Mcdonalds, enclosed playground, huge parking lot, small parking lots are endemic along the i10 out to Palm springs, so the lot size is worth noting.  Very close to the freeway</review>

< Review>
Cockroach Alert!! Last time I will eat there. The cashier added an extra meal that we did not order, when I tried to explain n get a refund since we already paid, this elderly lady came with an disrespectful attitude.  When our order came she told the other employee to take out the fries and db chs bgr "they don't want it" I was like "NO I didnt order it!" Guess what! I went to get my drink and there is a cockroach relaxing on its back in the fountain drain. I got the manager, she just look at it n went back to talking. WHAT! Bad service n bad customer service. They should learn to apologize for their mistakes.<//Review>

<time>1500315248199</time><rate>3< /rate><text>Well I was taking a drive to the beach and decided to buy the kids some food first. So we got down to eat inside (my car just got detailed) and there were to cashiers open people standing around and no real line. One libe for both? Well the cashier just said next and whoever went was served. The cashier was nice . We recived our food ot was good. However the place was hot. There were flies inside bumbs were getting free soda, a lady was eating food from home , the place was old and dirty. The kids did not care , and my moca was $3 less than starbucks so it was ok i guess. And they have play area for kids.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Horrible service. Horrible employees including the an expecially rude employee named "Roxy" who cursed at me and her fellow employees. She got my order wrong and even at one point questioned why I was there. Overall horrible experience. I suggest you fix it.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I went to the drive thru of this mc donalds tonight and i only ordered a large sweet ice tea and 3 chocolate chip cookies the girl didnt do very well taking our order she had us repeat ourselves 4 times as we finally made it past the order taking we arrived at the 2nd window which was left half open we werent greeted, no eye contact was made she had us waiting for a while before she asked for our card, the bad service dosent end there im then asked to drive on to the red bars to wait for our order, 4 minutes later 2 cars have already been served and have driven past us. I was so tired and frustrated as it is i just drove off without ever receiving my order i already paid for. Now its just a simple late night craving but my money and time was easted during this annoying experience. My question is why am i being set aside to wait for 3 cookes and an ice tea and seeing customers passing me by?</Review><userid>102831036020577767732< /userid>< pictures>

Typically McDonald's. The employees didn't understand what they were selling. Try ordering a large iced coffee black, sometime: it confuses them every time.</text>

Very slow and not busy. I had ordered Mc Chicken and waited over 15 minutes for it. My total order was only 3 items iced tea,  oatmeal cookie  and Mc chicken. All other McDonald's this order would have been completed almost by the time I paid for it or with in a few minutes.</Review>

<review>I mean, it's a McDonalds, but clearly one where the big money was put into the original build, and not much goes into staff or upkeep.  Large location, lots of TVs, and they bring the food to your table.  Unfortunately, the bathrooms have graffiti all over and show lots of wear, and the place is understaffed (broken ketchup dispenser, full trashcans, long waits to order / get food).

Skip this one and hit another exit instead.</review>< Pics>
