I like this location. I rented before the pandemic and just came back to check on my unit today and I'm pleasantly surprised at how clean the location is and how other tenants just come in and out and don't hang out. I appreciate the cleanliness and the hours here. Will definitely recommend.</review>

< Review>
This place is great. It's very clean and the staff is amazing. It all starts at the top wit the property manager Krystal. Shes very helpful, friendly and knowledgable. When I went in there, she went out of her way to show me the property, from the units inside the facility to the parking spaces outside and this property is huge! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and when you go, ask for Krystal. She's the one to see!!<//Review>

<review>From the inception of my arrival to Storage Etc., I was greeted with a smile and a knowledgeable Mr. Valle. He could tell I was anxious and unsettled due to my move and made things as painless as possible. He showed me several units and assisted me in selecting an option appropriate for my move. He was fair, knowledgeable and kind. He listened.  He was clear about pricing and did not waiver from his approachable spirit. Even as I became a member of the Storage Etc. family, he checked to see if the space I rented accommodated my needs and expectations. When I vocalized a small issue with the wiring up top covering the unit, he had his carpentry/maintenance professional immediately attend to my concern. Mr. Valle even had an additional lock placed on the unit at no additional charge. You see, I had been harassed by members of my community and many of my valuables compromised as well as stolen from my home. Hence, my move. Mr. Valle didn't judge me. He treated me like a human being and assisted me to the best of his ability. How many companies even care about customer service anymore unless the workers know there is a survey/report card keeping track of their work record? There was no survey with Storage Etc., but it is imperative the world know how great a worker they have in Mr. Valle. Point blank.< /review>< name>

These guys are awesome! The staff is very helpful, courteous and accommodating, even on short notice. I have stored my boats and RV with them for years. The property has excellent security, video surveillance and is kept very clean. Access thru the security gate is quick and the centralized location off the 405, 91 and 110 freeways if fast for anyone in the South bay. Great value and a definite thumbs-up.....<//review>

Extremely nice staff. Very friendly on the phone they walked me through every step as far as what size I needed of a storage unit. I’ve used a couple storage facilities and this one is by far my favorite!!< /review>

<Review>My vehicle got broken into while at facility. Management wanted to raise my rent 34%. Didn't return my phone call. Vehicles get really dirty parked right by the freeway. Rust ruins vehicle as it drips on vehicles. Original manager was great. New management just wants money and doesn't care about current long term 13 year customers. I quit.<//Review></record>

I really like this place. I had to move my stuff out of my apartment in a hurry and they were able to help me, I like the deal that I got on my unit.  Eric was friendly and was able to answer all of my questions. I would definitely recommend this place! Check them out!<//text>

I have used Storage Etc. for about a year. I have only used this location on 190th in Gardena but it has always been a good experience. Anytime there were billing issues or I needed help with storage needs they have always been courteous and professional and we were always able to resolve our issues quickly.

I would recommend this location to anyone. Also, Storage Etc. has the lowest prices in my area which is always a plus.</text>

< Review>
I want here to move my storage into my boyfriends storage space came to find out he did not have enough room at all for my stuff and our new baby that's on the way!  knowing that they were going to be closing soon I called and asked if I could rent a storage the same day the guy Eric volte was so helpful and made me feel so great and it calms me down a lot to know that I could get a storage the same day and a great price it made it so convenient and I was happy my dad didn't have to load the truck backup he sounds of a storage unit not too far from my boyfriend in the same area and even closer to the truck then we expected. thanks again Eric for all your help and professionalism and for the convenience for me and my dad then I have to go to another store space and deal with that hassle!  Keep up the good work!!! 😀<//Review>

I had temporarily moved my items out and Eric helped me keep my unit by placing a lock on my unit if I came back. That was super helpful because I did not want to move out.  Well guess what I did come back. I just called him and the lock was removed just like that. I will use this location again.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Called Storage Etc. in need of a boat storage space for my friend's classic wood boat. It was a last minute call as the other storage place my friend lined up was too far away. We called and spoke with Eric who understood our dilemma and said he could take care of us. Eric met me upon arrival with the boat and showed me the spot he reserved for us. Great spot right up front in their totally secured storage yard for vehicles and boats. Storage Etc.'s yard is well designed with plenty of space to maneuver a truck pulling a 20' trailer with a boat. Eric also informed me that their yard is covered with CCTV cameras throughout and they also havesecurity patrolling the facility and yard! I highly recommend Storage Etc--very professional organization with great rates--for all your storage needs. Thanks again, Eric!</Text>

<Review>First of all i want to thank Storage Etc for taking care of me. I had a reservation at Life Storage down the street and the day i have to move in they do not have records and me having confirmation email. I was frustrated and needed to be at the airport to catch my flight. I looked on line and found storage etc i called and the manager was noce and said she would take care of me and did. Thanks cristal for dealing with my frustrating and getting me a parking spot. I will forever be thankful.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I've been a resident at this facility for a while now and have had a few incidences but it was nothing that couldn't be resolved.  Place is always clean, the staff is professional and helpful, hours to access the facility are good, security cameras all over the place - what else can you ask for?< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I have been renting here for some time and I love this place. The girl at the office is very talkative and always helpful. There is a lot of vigilance here. I know that my car is in good hands. I highly recommend if you need to wait for a car come here.

Nice, quiet, and well maintained & taken care of considering how far & lonely the area is from large towns. Easy access and good to stretch your legs.< /Text>

<review>Great place to stop and rest aside from the really gross smell. The other two people that were with me didn't mind it but I thought it smelled weird. There are a lot of bugs in the restrooms which is a little spooky but they are clean besides that.</review>< resp>

<text>I understand that liquor store prices are higher than the grocery store. I wanted to check out our local liquor store.

Not impressed. I was charged $2 each for a half pack of mikes hard lemonade. It was the only bottles they had left yet he said those are the rules. I also got a pack of blue moon. Got home and they weren’t even cold.  I will not be stopping by again. If he didn’t over charge me and the beer was cold, I would have been okay to visit often.<//text>< Pics>

Good selection but more pricey than just going to a grocery store. I'm new to town, but this is the first liquor store I've ever been to anywhere that does not put prices on its beer. They put price tags on their wine so you know they're capable of doing it-- they just refuse to. That seems pretty inexcusable to me, especially since they never put anything on sale so the price shouldn't change.</review>

<Review>Yes it is a convenience store, but...their prices make it seem more convenient to go all the way to the grocery store. I wish I could come here more often since they are so close, but they are just too overpriced.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Jake was extremely helpful. They have lots of cool stuff, great staff, and just an overall cool vibe. They also resurface game discs, which is super handy if you have a kid who is rough on your discs.<//text>

<Text>I came in with a bunch of decently old sports cars and was offered two dollars for two pretty good size boxes of old baseball cards including rookie rookie year cards and revenue cards and also a generator which did not bother asking for a price because of the insult that he gave me for the sports cards I would not recommend anyone selling anything to them because they’re just going to wait under price it in also I’m assuming their stuff for sales also probably</Text>< pictures>

they were honestly so chill and nice and even let me hold the item i was thinking about purchasing and when i realized i didnt have enough to buy it on the spot they told me that i can make payments on it! so i was really excited about that and they even let me hear what the bass sounded like. 10/10 would reccomend anyone going to M.A. Griffin & Sons</text>

Offered me $300 on a new $3500 item with a straight face, less than 10%? After I declined the offer I was told to try another shop on Ming that I'm guessing is associated with Griffin & Sons.
Plenty of different options around town so i won't be back here or the shop on Ming to sell or purchase anything.
In my opinion taking advantage of neighbors in need of help is Bad business but to each his own.</review>

I have taken my gold to several local shops in the past , I have nothing negative to say regarding the other pawn shops , how ever son's and Griffith has shown me courtesy and service which is superior to the extent that I have decided to deal with them exclusively. This evening immediately upon entering the store down town "19th" I was greeted and served both with efficiency and respect by a new employee by the name of Cody, even in training no mistakes maintaining the standard. I appreciate it and recommend them to you Bakersfield.<//Text>

The guys at MA Griffin and Sons are awesome. They will work with you to provide you with the best customer service possible. It is the only pawnshop I use they have  quality merchandise at reasonable prices.  Their loan values are more than fair. By far the best in town.</Review>

From the moment I walked in I was greeted and directed towards my sole purpose for being there. Had a great convo while being helped, staff was polite and respectful and funny. I had no problem what so ever with any service needed. And as for prices I'm positive you aren't going to find a place that will leave you feeling fair and uncheated.. Griffin's is definitely a place I will be returning to!!! Thanks Cody, Matt and Jacob for making this a pleasant experience for Me and my friends!!<//Review>

Every time I've been in the shop, someone is more than willing to help me with any questions I have. I have pretty much left with something every time I've gone in! They are friendly, courteous, professional, and a pleasure to do business with.< /Text>

<Review>Never had a problem getting something for my goods there. Pawn Shops are a lot better than payday loans, which will make you want to run out in front of traffic before all is said and done. Painless exercise. Good Service each and every time. Recommended.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Overpriced, not friendly worst pawn shop in town. I visit all the shops in town and by far the worst ! They have two shops in town  the staff and management sucks. The other one has a good employees.  Maybe just one... they don't know how to price the items... and don't  like to be told the truth... so keep it forever if that's the goal... know what you have .. you can't get rich off of 1 item , dont overcharge just because you over paid.  Js

Update
So I decided to go back 2 months later.. I ask the price of some bulk items in a box an employee said $1 to $2 bucks , I said well what is it? he said $2 bucks so after 45min or so I know what I want and was ready to spend $200 then he asked the store manager for the price and he changed it to $3 per item... I just had to walk away.  Mark it or stick to the price that was said. Piss poor management.  I'll keep spending my money elsewhere..</Review>< Name>

This is if not the best Pawnshop in the West coast! If not accross the nation. The staff is friendly, very helpful and understanding. I now live 300 miles, 4 hours away and I still make my way back home! It just feels like home..
Thanks guys
Forever your brother Matthew!

I would not go anywhere in Bakersfield. When ever i need a few extras to make ends meet. Griffiths Pawn always treats the customers with care and compassion. Recently i bought a 60 inch smart tv. Valued around 500 cash open market. Griffiths made my Christmas. Hello 375 out the door. Just bought laptop as well. Electronic are superior and better then most pawn shops. Never had anything thing come up missing or stolen. God bless .naytisha n kevin.<//review>

<Text>M A Griffin and Sons are a bunch of liars. You should not go to them. I called them and asked if they would be interested in a Kodak photo viewer. They told me yes they would be interested as long as it was in good shape. I took the item down to them. It was in nearly mint condition. I told them I had a photo viewer to sell and before I even took it out of the bag the guy told me they did not buy those.<//Text>< pics>

This place used to be the best pawn shop in town with a wide variety of products clean welcoming environment with kind upbeat friendly staff members now when you enter it is dirty stuff piled (not neatly stacked or arranged propelry at all) all over the floor and the staff is very unreliable and unknowable I walked in two weeks ago with a generation one PlayStation 3 power cord HDMI and several games and before I could even pull it from the backpack the person who was "assisting" me seemed very much uninterested in my situation and then tells me he can only give me  $10 for everything I understand that the demand for gaming equipment during this time of year and the condition of the said console and what it comes with but in all $10 is pretty insulting and then retracted the offer because of a sticker this place has seriously lost its appeal and sadly I believe I will no longer be bringing my business to this poorly ran establishment</Review>

Its a great place to pawn Jewelry's especially when you really need cash right away and it doesn't take that look and also they have a lot of stuffs that you would be interested, stop by at M.A. Griffin & Sons at 1234 19th St. Bakersfielse, CA.93263</Text>

I tried to sell them a helmet with camera I barely only used twice which cost me 900 dollars. To them for 150 dollars they said would you do below 100 and scammed me they would make a 300 dollar profit either way. just scam artists and idiots.<//text>

<text>Crooks, Liars, they basically make up the rules as they go. I have a 4000 dollar guitar down there that they wont release I have to file a complaint, hire a lawyer, and a bunch off bull@#$%$#@#$% to get my property back. A buddy of mine past away, but before he did he told me he wanted me to have this guitar.(Gibson 1942 J45) its a nice guitar and they know it. he signed the  ticket and told me that all I had to do was pay the ticket off and the guitar was mine unfortunately he passed away about a month later. I went down to get the guitar had the money to pay and they wouldn't release it to me even though  everything on their ticket said I have every right to it , he still would not release it. He told me its solely up to the owners discretion, whether to release it. told me to come back on the fourth after he talks to the owner well the ticket is up on the third. gee isn't that funny.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< review>
we went in to buy a motorized scooter for my fiances dad and they said it just needed to be charged and it worked perfect. We got it home charged it up, turned it on and low and behold it doesnt work! We bought it on a friday night 5:30pm called thw very next morning at 9:30am to tell them it doesnt work can we bring it back. They said all sales are fine but bring it in maybe we can do something..... we bring it in right away and tell them everything and they say the same thing well we dont give money back, and the guy that sold it to us says oh and theres a weight limit noticing.... and then states "but i wasn't going to say and talk you out of a sale" can you belive that one! intead of informing us of facts they new about the scooter they went ahead and and sold it, and now say sorry we cant do anything about it. All the bad reviews on here are spot on with how they treat you and they handle business. Sad to see a business  thriving on ripping people off and then gloat about it in your face when you come back unhappy.</review>

me and my wife purchased a cell phone from them, mind you we have busy lives....the phone did not charge the guy who sold it said that it needed a battery so i purchased a battery from radio shack and low and behold it turned on but when it died the phone would not even so much as blink. Tried to take it back a few weeks later when i finally had time to do so being a full time student working 2 jobs and they refused they said they can give me store credit. the manager chris would not know his head from his posterior. they have been known to rip some people off i am reporting this shop the the bba for not only selling damaged products and lying about it but refusing to fix their mistakes< /Review>

these guys are only interested in keeping your jewelry, I went there one day after my contract was due and they told me they no longer had my jewelry, I went back a few weeks after that and they had it for sale, I now go to all american jewelry where they arent interested at all in keeping your stuff. Stay away from these thiefs!!!</text>

<Text>not surprised at all after reading some of the reviews rude customer service it might be a generation thing or something they hire all this young people that dońt have any respect or manners as soon as you called them out on it and remind them who the customer is they all team up Against you seriously the security the plus size lady immediately got it to my personal space trying to intimidate me really whats this the wwf the two managers and the young girl with the attitude all against me all for not accepting her rude behavior at this point hoping one day this rude cashiers are replace with self check out it will probably save their company money and save me a bad attitude experience from their human cashiers .< /Text>< pics>

<review>I would give it a 0 if I could. I happen to be in the city of Perris, since I was there I decided to go to Ross. Wow!!! The store is not organized at all. They don’t have enough employees and the ones they do have are rude. The lines are long inside the store and outside. They have a very poor system. I waited in the return line for over 30 minutes.... I was only the second person in line! I felt bad for the lady in front of me, she was there before me. Who knows how long she waited! Save your time and money and shop elsewhere.<//review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Sadly the "Perris curse" has hit this place. Unfortunately everything in Perris is not up to par as the same stores in neighboring cities . Maybe it's just Covid but their shelves look bald and bland 🙁 . Not dirty or unorganized just especially disappointing since we are so very close to the distribution center.</Review>

This is the worst place ever, my grandma got transferred here after her time in the ER was over. She had made lots of progress and was showing incredible signs. She was doing very good but was very neglected by staff and faculty. Another thing is that they never made sure she had her oxygen on, which she needed. if your loved one is going here for the intense care unit PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM HERE! This is the worst place ever and they did not continue checking up on my grandma, knowing she would take her oxygen off. This staff does not care for your loved ones health, they show no remorse or kindness to patients what so ever. My grandmother recently passed away because of the neglect she was facing at this rehab. So please if you care for your loved ones; DONT SEND THEM HERE.<//review>

My father is in for the last two weeks and is doing great after surgery. The only issue is his walking. Before the surgery he was able to walk around his home, slowly. It was enough to take care of himself. He’s in rehab just to get him walking again, since he hasn’t walked for several weeks. He claims that nobody has been to his room for getting him up and walking around the couple weeks he been in. With no visitors without an appointment it’s hard to verify this, but my father’s memory is very good yet, and when I ask the staff they say they are, my father says differently. Someone is lying.<//text>

This place just took my grandfather last week and he went in he was just a little weak but the doctors didn't find any major issues other than him not doing enough excerise and eating properly. Within a matter of a couple days he had a terrible staff infection and he was throwing up blood. This place nearly killed my grandfather and to make matters worse they will not let you in half the time, they LOST his personal belongings, and even the doctor at the hospital said that they see this exact issue from this rehab facility all the time!!! They go in fine and they come out near dying!!! This place must be shut down before their negligence gets more people killed!! Makes me sick!<//Review>

This place was a such a bad experience. We had my father here to recover but all they did was neglect him. He got horrible bed soars from how little they acctualy moved him positions and from how little they cleaned him. The doctor never updated you with peogress or with lab test results. The physical theipy personel would do the minimum and just be talking the whole time amongs themselfs. We had them send my father to the hospital becuse they neglected to do anything about a mass growing in his stomach. Neddless to say it was a serious situation and if we didnt get him to the icu quickly things could have taken a turn for the worse. Seams like all they did here was add more pain.</Review>

Thankfully she survived with only a moderate case. Overall this place is like all the others she has been in. I would normally give 3 stars if it were not for her case manager Kim. She was so kind and was the best we have experienced anywhere. Reche Canyon, if you are reading this, she is making you look much better in my eyes and earned you a solid one star increase!!!</Review>< user>

My father was transferred to this facility by Corona regional hospital that did absolutely nothing for him. But this facility took wonderful care and they did allow us to come in at the end of his life so we could contact family that was not able to be here so everyone could say their goodbyes. They were very wonderful and caring.</review>

My cousin suffered brain damage 7+years ago and is totally bedridden. He has been To multiple locations where he has received less than average care and it was so terrifying to see the horrible things that go on at some of these care facilities. We had to move him around until we found a place that we saw was consistently and properly taking care of him and his needs, as well as ours when we inquired about his recovery. Hes now been at Reche Canyon Rehab for almost 5 years and they have done wonders with him. They go above and beyond to make sure he gets the best care possible. We’ve never noticed any signs of neglect or mistreatment from any of his caretakers or staff members at this facility unlike the previous two locations he was at prior to arriving there. Family is super important and it’s so hard to find nice safe clean place with great people to care for them when they’re in need of help. I saw all these horrible reviews so I had to speak up and share with others about how awesome this place truley is because it is so hard and really scary trying to find a good place for our loved ones. So I was really upset to read bad things about such a good place. I called today just to check in on the visitation schedule and LJ picked RIGHT AWAY and was super professional and helpful, like always. He had to place me on hold to get my question answered but came back within 60 seconds with all the information info i needed and more. Plus he always has a great attitude and was very knowledgeable. Dont let this crazy pandemic situation mess up a good place’s reputation, were all dealing with crazy times right now with the limited resources so we have to be considerate for the people who are taking care of the people who cant care for themselves. I’ve had to take care of my own Mom and it was so hard to find time and deal with her needs and crazy stubbornness and house, feed and bath her, so I understand the struggle is real.</text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I was a patient at this facility a few years back and after reading all the awful ratings I had to put my two cents in. My stay in this facility save my life I was in a motorcycle accident where I fractured my back the therapist that work with me his name is Joe me he got me through my first month at what turned out to be Exchange in life I was in a wheelchair for 7 months learning how to walk again it was a staff at this facility they gave me all the tools I needed to move on with my life. I think all the awful reviews come from people expecting miracles or more that can really be expected. In order to recover from an injury you have to want to be rehabilitated if you treat your therapist and staff poorly you will obviously get a poor response.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

If you care about your loved ones, do not let them go here. I would give a zero star if I could. They’re negligence led to my grandfathers passing. They do not care. They left him alone for hours on end, he ended up getting bed sores. They gave him narcotics when he wasn’t prescribed anything but Motrin. He lost a ton of weight because they weren’t feeding him. Seems like they just want their patients drugged so they don’t have to do their Job.< /text>

He has had numerous roommates pass away in the last 3 months due to negligence of not responding to alarms coming from the rooms. There all too busy having luncheons and fundraisers for there own special events. I can't wait till my bro gets out of there and his wife can bring him home.

<time>1575953855059</time><rating>1<//rating><review>My sister was sent to Reche canyon rehab after sustaining a back injury. The nurses aide put a diaper on her. She is not incontinent! She was able to use the bedpan. They were so long answering the call light that she had to use the diaper a few times and ended up with a bladder infection which they did not treat. She was discharged after 10 days. It was very rushed and the nurse and physical therapist seemed surprised and unprepared. She was sent home without discharge instructions. The doctor ordered home health, PT and OT. The case manager did nothing! She should have gotten authorization from her insurance and sent orders to a home health agency. She did Nothing.
Her primary doc took care of the infection and home health. She has been home 2 weeks in a back brace without home health or PT. They are starting tomorrow.

Reche canyon rehab is incompetent, smelly, uncaring. Don’t go there!< /review>< pics>

Why has this facility remain opened??
I feel that this place should be investigated thoroughly by state officials. Doctors and Social Services do not respond to messages left.  Patient with anxiety & pain left for another patient only to die from heart attack that could possibly be prevented!  DO NOT SEEK CARE HERE!!</Text>

Every RN has 20 patients a person. There is no way any patients needing real care or assistance to be cared for there is just no time for anykind of attention. If you loved is basically 100% healthy and can communicate clearly and use the restroom alone you can send them here... but if they need help or assistance PLEDE SAVE THEIR LIVES and fight for them to go to Somewhere else..this place does give enough staff to properly run.. I will give another review with details later... please fight you loved ones< /review>< user_id>

Kaiser Permanente recommended that our mother live her last days in this facility because the doctors didn’t think she would survive living in the higher elevation where we live on hospice. Kaiser provided the “comfort care” room. This room is designed to be family friendly, allowing 24/7 access and a place for a member of the family to sleep with her overnight. The doctors are caring and compassionate. Everyone was helpful and respectful. The setting is amazing, away from the hustle and bustle of the city yet freeway close for all the family to visit.< /review>

My husband was recently a patient at Reche Canyon for  a little less than a month. I was able to visit him every day and witnessed the progress he made on a daily basis thanks to his effort and to the staff that helped him day after day.  He received exceptional service and care by the nursing and physical therapy personnel.  I can't thank them enough for their dedication to help us, their kindness and professionalism.  The office and food services departments were always very attentive and helpful as well.  Thank you, everyone, for helping us in our time of great need.  God bless you all.

<review>This place is the worst I have ever seen not only did my father pass away in this place many years ago but now I personally know why, I was put in here for after surgery rehab and I thank God I was taken out by family members after 1 day of being there. I hope I never have to go there again. Way too many reasons I hate it there. I wish I didnt have to give it any stars at all.< /review><UserId.>118137746018391547156<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80dcac6f5ebb8813:0x6e313692d6103084<//GmapID>< Pictures>

My mom was there & she hated it. She was left exposed, left in the bathroom for 45 mins with the door closed. Thank God I spoke to the doctor who released her to my care. Although Administration was very helpful who tried to resolve any problems. It’s the nurses, they are overwhelmed, too many patients & not enough staff. This is what one nurse relayed to me. Watch your Love one closely there cause patients are usually unattended.</text>

My wife was sent here about a montn ago for physical theraphy on her leg. From the second she got there @ 9 o'clock  she wasn't acknowledged  at all. It took the staff almost 3hr for them to realize she was a new patient if it wasn't for myself asking them for her meds and any documents they needed me to sign for her , they would have taken longer for her to get acknowledged , they also give u dirty looks  when u ask for there services. Also her pain meds where not even in there system  they had to re-order them. So she was in agonizing pain for about 16 hrs. Staff was suppose to help her in and out of bed do to the fact she was a fall risk, they did care at all she was made to get up on her own to the restroom. And back and also adjust her self on the bed when she wasn't able too cause she had cervical surgery. That got me so angry  I got my wife out there in 1 day. This place should  b shut down  do to the fac5 that they r very careless.....<//Text>

The worst experience ever my father was here two days and got a rash! The nurses ignore the patients and are rude! This place is filthy and disgusting. There is no air in the rooms only where the nurse station is. Do not leave your loved ones here the worst experience ever!<//Review>

From the first day until she was discharged my sister's care was wonderful. The entire staff are caring, compasionate and are highly skilled and efficient. Her case manager, Cindy Peel ushered her and our family with kindness and skill throughout her stay and guided us in finding another placement. Thank you Reche Canyon.</Text>

My father was sent to this "rehabilitation" center after a broken back and head trauma in late April. The staff is barely attentive and give dirty looks when you ask for assistance making it almost a necessity to be there from open to close. My father developed blood clots which moved to his lungs after Kaiser had to re-stitch the incision because of an infection he developed because Reche left his back brace on 24/7 rarely turning him. After he was cleared they sent him back to reche where he spent 3 weeks of people leaving him alone in the dark, refusing medicine, ignoring his yells and screams for help and the physical therapy was a joke. This is a nursing home where very ill people go, not a facility to help get people up and going.This is the worst place I've ever been to. My father and our family were traumatized by this facility.< /Text>

<text>My father was a patient there.
Was supposed to receive physical therapy for his legs.
Instead was striped down, put in a paper diaper and told to stay in bed.
Horrible services. Patients are parked in a common room while the people that are supposed to take care of them, sit around and read newspapers and watch tv.
Don't let your loved ones go there.</text>< rate>

My sister was here couple months ago. We put her in this facility for a week due to flu season, we all had flu and we did not want her to get sick. The second day after we brought her home she passed away due to their neglect. If you care for your love one do not take her there.</Text>

<review>Place is horrible. I wouldn't send my worst enemy there. My very dear friend acquired a staph infection there, they refused to give her pain medication & she ultimately died there. As she was taking her last breaths her doctors denied that she was dying & refused to give her medication to assist with her shortness of breath. This is coming from a hospice nurse.< /review><Date>1472890954722</Date>< rating>

I was sent to Reche Canyon from Kaiser, Fontana  after 15 days in the Hospital, flat on my back. I am 85 years old and midway through my stay at Kaiser I had surgery to repair a torn diaphragm and liver from a broken rib. When they discharged me to Reche Canyon I had not been out of bed for 15 days. I arrived at Reche Canyon on Easter Sunday, April 16th with Oxygen @ 2% and couldn't even sit up by myself. The staff was wonderful, attentive, the food wan't too bad and best of all - NO SMELL. They worked with me every day and I was discharged on April 29th without any oxygen and able to get up out of bed and walking around the facility on my own, with a walker of course. I am very happy with the care I was given  here and would recommend this facility to anyone who must go to a skilled nursing facility.< /Text>

I hate to even give this place one star but I have to because it won't let me choose zero stars. BEWARE!  Worst place ever!!  My 22 year old son was sent here from Kaiser with a brain injury.  We only had four options of sub acute care facilities to choose from and Reche Canyon was the best of the worst. The first time he was sent there he was only there for four days when he had to be rushed back to the hospital with pneumonia as well as an unstageable bed wound (did not have this when he was discharged from Kaiser 4 days prior).  The bed wound was later staged at a stage 4. He was sent back to Reche Canyon two weeks later where his bed wound continued to get worse (down to his bone). Within a two month timeframe he was in the emergency room at Loma Linda 3 different times. The last straw for me was when they ended up having to bag him (CPR) because his oxygen saturation dropped below 50%, he was sent to the emergency room at Loma Linda where he then was transferred to Kaiser with pneumonia for the third time, a completely out of control bed wound,  and a staph infection. After that I did everything I could not to let them send him back to Reche Canyon. Reche Canyon almost killed my son due to the lack of care. I was there every single day with my son but they do not allow anybody to stay past 9 PM. So between 9:00 PM and the next day only God knows what they did with my son or didn't do with my son.  Plenty of times staff there would tell me that they are understaffed and this is why some patients don't get tended to properly, especially the patients that don't have family members to speak up for them. If your family member cannot speak for themselves DO NOT send them here. I have educated myself on patients rights and learned how to be an excellent advocate for my son.< /Review>

My father, Wilburn Milligan is in room 112 and had to wait an hour for someone to give him pain medicine last night for his broken hip, he is almost 90 years old.
today he came back from dialysis and needed covers on and again his call button doesn't seem to work to get help! The lady with his dinner tray had to help him! I hope he has his pain medicine when he needs it tonight, or I will be filing a complaint! I called the hospital and got disconnected!<//Review>

Ruben was very professional and confident!  Went out of his way to replace some old hardware that wasn't directly involved with the issue at hand and was incredibly thorough.  Very happy with the 45 minute response time and the overall service!  10/10 plan on using Roto Rooter for any future service!<//text>

Reuben was very friendly and professional. He helped us with a clog we had. He looked at our bathroom sink and turned the hot water off until we can get it fixed. He was able to get rid of the clog. We will be calling them back to have someone replace our faucets.</review>

Toilet has been slowly draining for almost a year now and we replaced toilet still had same issue. Called Roto Rooter and our toilet is now flushing so much better. The plumber they sent was very clean and so professional. I will gladly recommend Roto Rooter to anyone.<//Text>

After a bad blockage in our toilet, Ricky got the s___ flowing again in a mere matter of minutes!! His was very polite and thorough, and took all the right precautions to keep us and him safe...and our home clean while he tended to the repair.

We called right away and they gave us a 4 hour window that they would send someone out, latest would be 11:30pm. By the way I am 8 months pregnant and we only have 1 bathroom. They called us back at 10:30 and said we have no idea when someone can come out but we can guarantee between 8-10 am next day, we had no choice so we took it. 10:15am the next day rolls around and no call and no show, my husband calls to find out and they said oh were busy and don't know when we can send someone. Not cool, so we ended up calling another company and they were at our house within 15 mins. DON'T EVER USE ROTO ROOTER!!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Ricky is excellent at his job he over came unexpected obstacles that were caused by the people who installed the toilet.
He is also I believe one of the best home service people we have ever had.
5 Star Service!
Thank You Ricky and Roto-Rooter!

Josh or tech 6075 has gone absolutely above and beyond. As an business owner I truly appreciate how far he has gone to offer alternatives to me in order to adhere to the budget I was looking for. So much so, in fact, that I will be asking specifically for him the next time I call for Roto rooter. Definitely a company to use regardless of the tech that has come out! ❤️❤️<//text>

I highly recommend Roto Rooter Plumbing.  They were available on short notice.  As promised, they came and diagnosed the problem at no cost.  The cost was for the job, not by the hour, and Marcus the plumber worked really hard to fix the problem.  He was polite, professional and a good communicator.  I am very satisfied with the service provided by Marcus and Roto Rooter.</review>

Very helpful, and made us feel important. When Robert got here, he was so sweet, and really knew what he was doing. It got dark but he didn't care. He quickly had the problem taken care of. And then he gave us some hints on how to keep it from happening again. Super nice, funny, and knowledgeable. We appreciate you!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I had one of your plumbers come out to the house to clear a storm drain and after working on it for a while he pretty much said he couldn’t clear it and charged the amount he stated $404.  And I was left with a clogged drain.  I had my brother come out and work the clog with straight rods and after 20 minutes of working the clog we got the line running and open.

The company has a good gig going in charging people for not unclogging the line.  They should have at least discounted the estimated price.  For a job not done.

He did fix a leak with my toilet.  Hope that was done right.  Time will tell.< /review>

He was punctual, communicative, took the time to explain what was wrong and how he'd be fixing the problem. This was not a clean job 😕 Our toilet line was backing up into the shower and the tub, and when he was wrapping up the job I realized Sanjay had taken the time to clean our bathroom as well.

I called the 24 hour number at 12:30am on a Thursday night as I had a toilet flood my upstairs bathroom and it was flowing through the vent downstairs.  The lady told me that there wasn't anyone available to come help me.  It turned out that she was in Oakland and I was in San Jose. She didn't check to see if anyone was available in the South Bay!  Well, it ended up saving me money anyway.  Then when they did come out to put a drying system up for my ceiling, they didn't secure it well and it fell down about a dozen times.  They ended up coming back to secure it but then needed it to stay on more day to dry.  It was extremely frustrating because they charged us a lot of money.  So, although the guys were nice, the work wasn't great and the price was obnoxiously high.<//Text>

It was the last day of 2019 and we woke up to a clogged toilet and shower stall that did not drain. I called Rotorooter and they sent someone out within one hour. It turned out to be a complicated job as the line between our house and the street was clogged. Philip fixed it and gave me great tips for how to prevent the same problem in the future. He was very nice and professional. The only thing I did not like was the cost...$800. I am not happy about it but I see it as a symbolic way of ending the year with flushing all that was bad down the drain, so that 2020 will start good and clean and new.< /Review>

The young woman scheduling the appointment was so cordial and likable. She assisted me with kindness and professionalism.

My son was here when the plumber arrived and said that he explained what was wrong to him and then proceeded to fix it. He was neat and clean and my sink works great!< /review>

<text>We have a recurring problem with our sewer line and have had to call for a clean-out on, at least, an annual basis, so we are familiar with many of the different service providers in our area. When Tevita came out today (on a Sunday morning, no less), he was polite, pleasant, and really wanted to understand the problem before attempting a solution. I believe he went above and beyond our expectations to fix the immediate problem and provides advice to help us resolve it moving forward. I highly recommend RotoRooter and commend Tevita for his customer-service skills.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< review>
Hello-
I just had Roto Rooter Service performed by a technician named Chris #5196 (or could be 5496 -can't make out the number on carbon copy).
He was attentive, polite and efficient. Cleared the line fairly quickly.
What I am appalled by is that he could not give me the usual 6 month guarantee which we normally get but have seldom if ever used.
His explanation was that his earnings percentages may be diminished if we called for a repeat service within those six months. Hearing this really upset me, why would you penalize an efficient technician this way???? We have been Roto Rooter customers for many, many years, although we know we have other choices out there.
This policy of yours is detrimental not only to your loyal customers but to your trusted technicians as well.

I would very much appreciate to get an extended 6 month guarantee on the service provided today, but never at the expense of your technician.
I would appreciate your getting back to me and forwarding this email to the appropriate person/s within Roto Rotter.
Sincerely,
J & M Garona

PS- I gladly contributed to your food drive today<//review>

<text>I called another plumber at first (local one) because we had water leaking from the toilet onto the ground. The local plumber didn't call back when they said they would, and when i followed up, they were like "sorry we're booked all day". When I called RR, on the other hand, they had a guy out within 2 hours, super friendly and informative, diagnosed all our problems and fixed them quickly. He took time to educate us on what he was doing all the way through, showed us problem areas and proof of work, and even recommended next steps we could take to prevent future issues. All things considered it was a great experience and I won't hesitate to use them again if needed! James was our technician and he was really great, funny, and highly skilled in his work.< /text>< pics>

Called and dispatch confirmed 2 appointments, both of which no one showed up. No text or call until 10 minutes before the first window ended. 2nd attempt no call or text at all I had to call in. Then they promised someone will be in the area. Finally 3 hours after the window ended they called and asked if I wanted someone to come out. With 20 minutes left in the work day. HORRIBLE.< /text>

We where very impressed with your Service Tech. Steven Sowanick!
He did an excellent job on finding our problem and fixing it.  And
truly being concerned about pleasing us and doing a good job.
If in the future we need to call on Roto Rooter again we can onlly
hope we get Steven for our tech.

< Review>
Roto-Rooter is not the cheapest, but they have reliable service, and 24 hour flat rate. I used other plumbers before, they charge less, but they sometimes don't want to do certain things or they do a lousy job.
Carlos Camarena (6080) was here today to help me with the kitchen drain problem. He was nice and knowledgeable. I actually learned some maintenance tips from him. Great job!<//Review>

The technician who came out to our house was fabulous. We have an issue with roots that get into our sewer system about once a year, and Roto Rooter has always dealt with us professionally and with great courtesy. They get the job done and have a 6 month guarantee. I have used other services in the past and none are as good for what we need done.  I recommend them!< /Text>

Called upon this company to help with a nighttime plumbing emergency. They assured me they would send their tech out to the property where 6 units were being affected by a back up. Having used this company many times previously, I went about my after hours life, resting assured that this vendor has committed to our work order.

Fast forward to the next morning... I get to my office to many emails and voicemails inquiring when the cavalry  (plumber) would arrive... Wait, what? I called Roto-Rooter and they gave me the run around, going so far as to tell me that someone cancelled my work order! WHAT? I called this ticket in and I am the only individual authorized to cancel...

Do not trust this company with your emergency plumbing issue. Call upon someone more reliable.

I'm still waiting to find out who the person was that was authorized to  cancel  my request.< /review>

We worked with Jose Garcia at Roto Rooter and couldn’t have been more impressed with his professionalism and caring demeanor. He really went above and beyond when we had an emergency flood in the townhome. He was reliable, efficient, on time, and kept us up to date on the progress. We trusted him completely. We can’t thank him enough for helping us during this challenging time!<//text>

<Review>I called them in the morning for my kitchen sink problem, and a plumber came very promptly on the very same day in the afternoon. I am pleased having David to fix my drain issue. He not only fixed the problem of drain clog, also helped me putting a new garbage disposal up since he found out that the old one was broken. He's also extremely helpful and friendly. If you are looking for plumbing help in San Mateo area, don't hesitate to give them a call. Service was quick and excellent!<//Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

Roto-Rooter had a snake long enough to find and fix the problem, when another plumber told us it must be a "soft clog."  It wasn't.  And Arnulfo took the extra time and effort to problem solve the right way.  Thank you Arnulfo.</Review><response>{'time': 1489330915405, 'text': 'We are so happy you are satisfied with the service provided by our technician.

<review>Our drains get clogged periodically, and Roto-Rooter always gives us good service for clearing them.  They always come promptly and are very efficient.  Today, Jerry did a fine job and was very friendly.
I'm very unhappy about their extreme price increases though.  In the past, they would run the snake from a cleanout on the roof, because it was the most accessible way, for something in the neighborhood of $300.  Now it costs $750 if they go on the roof.  Jerry was able to do the job from the ground today, thus sparing me that exorbitant charge.  But an increase of that size is outrageous.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Roto Rooter is an excellent plumbing and drain company.   The service personnel were exceptionally detailed and precise in identifying the problem and worked overtime and on the weekend to clean out a hazardous waste situation and install a new pipe system to ensure the safety of the property.  Luis Galindo, #0211, removed the corroded pipe and installed a new one that will not rot or be easily susceptible to breakage.  I am extremely grateful to everyone on the Roto Rooter team that helped with this situation.  It was absolutely a job that had to be done by professionals.  Everyone was on time, on budget, completed the work perfectly and were finished early.  This is truly a company that gets the job done fast and right.  Thank you!</text>

Oh YES, another happy Roto-Rooter customer am I !! Had two drain problems that were giving me trouble. I tried to clear the problems a couple of times but had limited success so called Roto-Rooter. Well within a few hours the drain problems were gone. Their service man, Bill was his name, was there within an hour or so and had both of the drains cleared and tested within an hour. It was especially reassuring to know that his testing showed both problems were completely solved. Hooray for Roto-Rooter ,  and thanks Bill !!<//text>

< review>
I called another company once about 30 years ago, they insisted my sewer lateral was cracked and needed to be replaced to the tune of something like $7,500.  I called Roto-Rooter for a second opinion and they cleared the line in no time at all and assured me there was nothing wrong with my lateral!  Since then, I NEVER call any other company when I have a drainage problem.  Also, one of their servicemen told me some 20 years ago to save my pantihose and attach one side to my washer drain to catch all the lint which was clogging my drain.  Since then, I have had very few drainage issues.<//review>

When I called Roto-Rooter about a leak, they came promptly and did an excellent job.

What made the biggest impression, though, was the courteous, professional, and highly skilled service provided by the technician, Kameron Tanouye.  His clear explanation of the problem and the repair work showed an awareness of the concerns of the customer.

Kameron Tanouye's excellent service deserves recognition.  He was a fine representative of Roto-Rooter, and I would certainly recommend the company to my friends.</review>

But, bro. I wasn’t expecting to set a new standard for Turkey Pesto against which I will now compare all future Turkey Pestos. It wasn’t a religious experience, but I’ll be chasing this high for a while.< /text>< Pics>

They have a very cute outdoor space and their indoor seating has access to outlets, so a great place to do work!   The people working there are super friendly.  Iced latte and yummy cream cheese bagel with veggies in the photo.  The bagel was more than i was expecting for $5.50 :)<//text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Zing is located near Ashby BART station and has a lovely fenced patio with table and chairs and a couple of benches.  They have umbrellas for the larger tables.  They offer several breakfast items such as coffee, oatmeal, bagel and cream cheese with lox, yoghurt with fruit and granola, croissant with meat and cheese.  They also serve sandwiches.  Zing provides great customer service and will offer to carry items to your table  if you have mobility challenges.  During the Covid challenge they sometimes run out but I have found as more customers are venturing out, supplies are better stocked.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFlO9qFYOcHXZ6oPTByNO3aXyBE81iDcIPf1os=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMduud_y0TPwK-hCqzUVcGP1nY5ufaPlOOalUg6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Zing Cafe has consistently friendly staff and fairly quick service.

I very frequently come in for a coffee and pastries for the office, and they're always quick, attentive, accommodating, and generous.

The pricing is fairly good as well for the ready-made food (I've not done any of the hot food yet).

-1 star for not the freshest pastries or most delicious coffee.

This place is a friendly workhorse!

Interesting decor / ambience that's not my cup of tea but I appreciate.< /review>< Rate>

Good snacks in a very pleasant atmosphere near Ashby Station.  If you're headed to Berkeley Bowl from BART, this is a great place to stop for a cup of coffee and maybe a bit to eat.  Their prices are very reasonable.  The food is made with care and delicious!<//Review>

<Text>Delicious family cafe and sandwiches that has been going on for at least 5 years now. Ana and Hugo behind the counter are great and very friendly. I could talk to them for a couple hours most of the times I go there. In an area where there aren't many outdoor sit down cafes, they make the place a little warmer for those passerbys. They make great tasting drinks. I go for their sweet drinks in the fridge sometimes. But best of all are their sandwiches. They have a great flavor in their food; they don't overseason and all their ingredients look bright and fresh. You can see them make your sandwich right there. Latest one I ate was the pastrami sandwich. It was at least a meal and a half for me.</Text>< pictures>

<review>I did not receive the friendly service I've heard about from this place. When I entered earlier today placed an order and went to grab a drink from the refrigerator. a couple of minutes later 2 other customers came in and made an order. The guy behind the counter took their order and began preparing their food and drinks before mine and when I made him aware of the bad service and canceled my order he shrugged his shoulders and said so what if you feel some type of way</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I ordered the Ham and Cheese Panini minus the ham asking for extra cheese in its place, which was agreed to. Instead, I got a toasted cheese sandwich, only containing two slices of cheddar when on the menu it clearly states pepper jack and cheddar cheese - so no extra cheese and only one type. I wouldn’t have ordered it had I known they didn’t have all the ingredients and weren’t going to panini it.

Please let your customers know when you run out of ingredients. Also, please take a look at your menu and see that all of the meatless options cost more than the meat options for some reason...< /Review>< pictures>

<Time>1490192214395</Time><review>These people are friendly but they're not overly bright. You need to keep a sharp lookout if you intend to get what you ordered. I've had to repeat myself many times and still something's wrong--no tomatoes and onions in the salad when they're right on the posted menu so it didn't occur to me to double check. This sort of thing is typical. You can't eat friendliness. I'd prefer efficiency and faster service.

In all fairness the service has improved in a year or so. They listen to you when you order. One more star.</review><userid>108395547241438789752<//userid><name>Joe Blow<//name><rating>4< /rating>< pics>

Absolutely the worst sushi ever. We did all u can eat and ended up cancelling the rest of our order. None of the fish tasted like fish or even fresh. Tasted like it had been shipped from a far off place.or had been frozen and thawed. It also took forever. And it was dead there so not sure why it took so long. Gas station sushi would taste better than this place. I told them we were leaving and to cancel the rest bc it didn't taste good at all. And no apology or orfwer to cut the bill just looks. Definitely a waste of $67. Don't waste your time.</Text>

I'm not a big sushi eater, maybe once or twice a year. But this is the best sushi restaurant I've been to. We had the avocado rolls, 911 rolls, spicy tuna with avocado, bsc rolls, spicy edamame,  yellowtail, and blue fin. Wow, it was all amazing. I have never eaten this much sushi, but I couldn't stop.
Very friendly staff, but it is not fast food. It takes time for things to come out, so make sure you have time to hang out if you are doing the all you can eat. But definitely worth it.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Slow service without even being remotely busy. If the sushi itself was amazing then i still would jave left happy but it was poorly put together and tasted awful. I wish i could have seen them at their best but sadly my first impression of the restaurant was so bad i wont be coming back</Text></record>

First time here for my wife and I and definitely will be back for sure. Service was GREAT!
Even with them needing staff our server Caitlyn, which by the way is new there and still did an outstanding job serving several tables by herself. There was a gentleman who came to help afterwards but overall EXCELLENT fist visit.

Will be back for sure and bring the rest of the family. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!< /Text>

<Review>I have been to a few sushi restaurant, since I moved here. I started going to Baby Tuna ( Bouquet) because close to my neighborhood . I have since moved to Valencia and not as close. I tried the sushi restaurants by me, I find they are more pricey and you get less? . I have finally went back to Baby Tuna on Copperfield and Bouquet ( closer to my new house) , Less expensive, good quality food and courteous service.  Bouquet used to have a fun Happy hour!< /Review>< Resp>

This is a good, new spot for lighter Asian fare. I went for one of their special poke plates which had salmon, squid, octopus, tuna and yellowtail. The sauce was light and didn't overpower the fish.

The one issue was the timing of the meals coming out. They were busy but one of the six meals never came. Once we brought it up, they rectified it and gave coupons for our next visit. Overall it's a good spot for a change of pace up in the area.< /text>

<text>Absolutely LOVE this restaurant so much!!!! Recently went out here with a few friends of mine for dinner, and oh my gosh, everything about it is amazing. The sushi rolls were made just right and were so delicious that I just wanted more (the most authentic sushi to this day), and their mochi ice cream was fantastic (so excited I got to have some!). The waitresses were so polite and friendly that it really made my friends' and my time here more exciting. The overall environment of Baby Tuna is just phenomenal. Would totally come back here again!! 😊<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Horrible place! My family came at 6PM and avail of the all you can eat. Order came piece by piece every 30 minutes. We sent our 2nd batch of order realizing that they are slow in preparing the food. Never came. We sent our 3rd order still didnt arrived. Finally we ask the server about our orders and came back to us verifying our order because she said they were confused. After constant follow up the order came out 9:30 PM and I was really trying not to make a comment. Since I already lost my appetite after 3 and half hours of waiting, I was just asking for a box so I can go home since my family is the only one left there and they are already cleaning their store and it seems that their ready to closed. They were arguing with me why i should ask for a box since all the food should be consumed there? They even told me that we ordered a lot? Orders that didnt came out....This place dont have a single cent of customer service! Food not so good either. The only reason people eat there is because of proximity. Nothing else.< /Text>

My wife and I got to witness a very unhappy customer who had to watch his family eat for 45 minutes while he waited for his food which was given to the wrong table by their waitress.
That same waitress tried to move us from our table even though their was 6 empty tables.
A younger sushi chef yelled at the waitress across the restaurant about her mistakes.
Other than all of that, the food was good.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<text>By far the best sushi I have had. I did have the all you can eat and I had the pleasure of being served by who I am going to call "80". He blew me away with how he prepared all of my orders. My favorite was the big eye tuna. The Hawaiian roll made me confused for a moment, it was like my brain was saying, is this best ever? Yea, it was. If I get the chance to go back, I will. Beautiful atmosphere. Great Service. Top grade sushi! Thank you Baby Tuna!!!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>Took forever to get our food.  We didn't even get everything we ordered.  Very dissatisfied and disappointed. One of the two chefs needed to stop taking shots with the customers and talking.  The waitresses were such troopers!  They were very apologetic. First and only time I'll ever go there.  Too bad because the food was pretty good.< /text>< Pictures>

1. We had to ask the waitress 3 times to get a fork
2. 45 minute wait with half empty tables (on 1 occasion) because one of the chefs was  gone
3. Took 10 minutes to get 1/2 of the miso soups we ordered
4. 30 minutes for a california roll and a rainbow roll (california with a variety of fish on top)
5. Seats are ripped
6. All this, while there was only my 3 person group and a couple at the bar.<//Review>

<Review>The sushi is really good quality. The sushi chef's are really know their craft and are friendly. However the wait staff is bad. They didn't seem to care too much about their jobs nor taking care of their customers. Come to Baby Tuna for the great sushi and sit at the bar. If you sit at a table don't expect much in the way of customer service.< /Review><date>1526091753906< /date>< pictures>

<Date>1530421108736< /Date><Rating>3<//Rating><Text>The sushi, in my opinion, is pretty good. My kids and I love going here and getting the food.  The restaurant is pretty clean but a little chaotic. The chefs behind the bar are very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. But the waiting staff is some of the worst in santa Clarita. They do not answer the phone so good luck ordering take out.  There is one older woman who knows what she is doing but if you get one of the younger girls, good luck.  A visit could last hours while you never get any attention or even sometimes the right order. But the food is good enough that we endure it anyway. If you have the time to think ahead driving over and ordering to go and then going grocery shopping at the Albertsons near by and then picking it up on the way out is probably your best bet.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c27dc0bff59aed:0x8ff441e475b1027< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good Sushi, quiet environment. A liittle too many rolls with crab mix, but I understand that's what a lot of the locals like. The wait staff was nice and quick. The yellow tail with Jalepeno and Ponzu is amazing. Will be returning, frequently.</review>

We have been here many times... I would say close to 20 maybe more! Never again. It was good for awhile, but it had just taken a bad turn. Repeatedly just very poor customer service. Food quality diminishing. It is such a good location we kept trying again, tonight was final straw. The staff had many obvious friends and family. It's was a a late weeknight so being busy wasn't the problem. We waited forever for everything, our order, our food. We even said don't bring us what we are waiting for, bring us the check. We have been there and tipped 20% plus many times. I hope the staff's friends tip them like that. Never again. It was much better when the owners worked there. Too bad.</review>

When she brought her roll, it was wrong then it took another 20 minutes to get our dry, saugy poorly put together sushi. We had them put it in a to go container due to the time we spent waiting for the food. Upon arrival we told the waitress that we had waited so long, she passed it off with excuses, laughed and walked away. VERY disappointed in this service. I DO NOT recommend at all. Go to shogun, it’s 10x better<//Review>< user>

<review>I HAVE FOOD POISONING. DO NOT COME HERE: (explanation) Worst sushi ever. Customer service was slow, inattentive, and just barely mediocre. Ordered sashimi and wasn't worth the price (small pieces), and thought it tasted a little funny (not fresh). I was too hungry to care that much after a long day of work. Asked for sauce multiple times before it was finally brought. And now I'm at home in the bathroom throwing up my guts. Should've gone to the viet place next door. I don't come home with food poisoning from that place. So in all, thanks for nothing and I will be in the bathroom for the next couple of hours. (sorry this is choppy, I usually never write yelp reviews as the effort isn't worth it but I made an exception for this trashy place)</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The sushi was a little slow to come out, but it'd not a big deal. I loved the fact that they had Toro options, and the sushi was pretty darn good
They have this sweet sake there, and I wish I found out the name of it, but it was so tasty<//Review>

This place is a family favorite. It's always been great and delicious.  We've tried a variety of dishes and they're all wonderful. Two things set this sushi restaurant apart from others:
1. You don't just have to rely on just soy sauce, they have delicious sauces that bring out the flavor of the rolls, without overwhelming it such as ponzu yuzu, eel sauce, spicy or sweet mayo, etc.
2. Their non-spicy sushi rolls are actually not spicy.  I've come across spicy items (wasabi or a dash of sriracha) mixed into non spicy rolls far too often at other sushi restaurants. Their regular spicy rolls are also not overwhelming.</Text>

<Review>I sat down for the sushi bar experience. Ordered Salmon Toro, Hamachi Toro nigiri. The rice did not have good consistency. It was overladen with ponzu sauce and the presentation was sloppy. If you look at the menu, this restaurant is catered towards folks who enjoy sushi rolls.<//Review>< Pictures>

I love this place! Jimmy, YaYa, Eddie number seven and Jay are awesome sushi chefs! You walk in and its a happy ambiance, they play music you want to dance to. If youre lucky, you can catch Jimmy dancing to Lady Gaga!  The fish is awesome and fresh. Ive eaten sushi at a lot of places, this is the best in SCV!  oh and don't forget, Wannee the undercover boss lady is the glue that holds it all together! She is fun and is very attentive! This is a great place overall to eat and get together.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Call me an idiot, but I've been to this restaurant too many times.  Well precisely it was 3 times, but I say anybody with the right mind and a brain bigger than a chestnut should have known better.

1st time:  Sushi
Eew.  Just, eew.  My poor stomach couldn't handle the nasty raw fishes and I had to excuse myself to the restroom.  I know, TMI.  But you as a customer should know this kind of important physical reaction that you may get by risking your life here.

2nd time:  Teriyaki
Did you used to be told to chew your food really well as a kid?  Like 10 times on each side of your month?  Ya, you'd be chewing meat 20 times on each side here, making your mama proud.

3rd time:  Shrimo & Tempura combo
Shrimp was touch as a rubber, and tempura was greasy as hell.

Apparently I am insane and have a brain smaller than a chestnut...<//Review>< Pics>

I have been eating sushi for 30+ years. The fish here is very fresh! All chefs (jimmy, yaya,eddie,jae) welcome you like family. They r talented and interactive with there own unique personality. And dont forget Wani. She is spunky/cute and the mom that holds it all together :). Hands down, the best sushi and service in santa clarita!!!! If you eat sushi and live in santa clarita, u r missing out if u dont eat here. Oh, and dont ask a chef to make u something special wink ;)< /Review>

Service was extremely slow. We were sitting over 2 hours and still never got everything we ordered. When we had to ask the waitresses for water, chop sticks, and napkins (due to the table not being set) they acted as if we were a burden. Needless to say we will not be back.<//Review>

<Text>I was told by several people not to go here, that they were awful. Now the wait was kind of long, but that was my fault. I am pregnant and didn't know I needed a release of liability form from my OBGYN in order to get X-rays for my teeth. Did this cause them to turn me away? Hell no! I gave her the number for Kaiser, my medical number, and she called herself and got the medical release form faxed over.

I haven't gone to the dentist in awhile. These ladies hooked me up! They got me fitted for visalign, took X-rays, and got me a whole dental kit, toothbrush, whitening tooth paste. The whole package!!

I will be back in a week for my follow-up from the X-rays, and I honestly cannot wait to see everyone. I had such a connection with the staff. Thank you Cristina Perez for all your hard work and helping me out!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1626211142278, 'text': "This is great news!

<review>Nancy arz was the one that helped us, she was very kind and helpful on what we didn’t understand and even made an affordable payment plan that we would ultimately be able to pay without us going broke. She was a big help and I give this a 5 stars< /review><gmap_id>0x80900c4d1f72616b:0x4e8d432aa1795f4a<//gmap_id><rating>5< /rating><user_id>102980719462381132115<//user_id><Response>None<//Response><Name>Herrecher Of Thunder<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I have had a few dealings with this office and had to speak with the manager about an urgent issue and asked that was told to call back in 15 minutes I called back and the manager was still busy and then I said okay I'll leave my phone number and you can call me back never received a call back. I called before closing and was basically hung up on. I've dealt with many other western dental offices and this by far is the worst office I have ever dealt with do not go here ever< /review>

I was great after that. Wonderful experience for me.

<Review>A quick but thorough experience at this WD. I transferred from LA County to San Joaquin County so it was my first time coming to this place. I was amazed by the professionalism and etiquette which made my experience extremely worth continuing to go to this WD. My last location was also good but this one just surpassed my expectations. Got everything I needed to do and continue getting dental services at WD. Everyone here works as a team and each person does their best to achieve great service. I don't just want to thank one person but rather everyone that I saw today and will probably continue seeing while I'm going to this WD. My experience in the past with WD has always varied with good and bad reviews alike but this was probably one of the best experiences I've ever had this far. This location is truly the best so I hope it stays that way. Hope that everyone gets the best service possible as it should be.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

Wait time is super long and my daughter and I were super irritated, but a young man by the name of Marco Cortes apologized and explained why the wait was so long, made us feel welcome, a lot of patients that day but he gave my daughter a sticker and she was happy. Overall customer service here outplays the wait time.< /Text>

Just moved to the area and needed a new dentist. Found this office because it's close to home. The front desk receptionist (forget her name but started with a K, Kara or something) had a smooth checkin process and the middle eastern dentist was thoughtful and explained everything smoothly. Will keep coming back< /review>

This place overbooks, sends people ahead and if your medi-cal you wait as long as they want you to. Never enough dr. Sent home about a dozen times because they just can't do it for some reason or another.</text>

<review>My daughter goes to this dentist and I really enjoy the friendly staff that they have as well as offering water and coffee my only request is that they actually look over the paperwork to see what the child's afraid of. My daughter has autism and sensory issues and I feel like they're not very aware of it even though I put on the paperwork and let them know so I think that they need to really take into consideration the way that children may I actually feel. Also when you schedule appointment a appointment it should happen then and there and you should not have to be waiting especially with a child who doesn't do very well waiting .other than that I've never had an issue with the staff or bringing my daughter here she feels very comfortable.<//review>< user_id>

Went here and always hate going to the dentist. I had a deep cleaning done by Carol the Hygienist on staff. She made it painless and did it with ease. It was my first deep cleaning and I must say I left happy. Normally my blood pressure is through the roof when I go to the dentist. With her, it wasn't. Very happy with this location and the staff. -Jeff< /review>

<text>I came to Western dental with hopes of doing my semiannual dental visit but it didn't happen. After waiting an hour I was told I have to be seen another day because I wasn't covered, which is far from true. I feel as though they don't do their due diligence the admin was ready to send me away without checking if I was covered. After about 10 Mintues she realized I do have dental coverage. 30 Mintues after that I was told they could not see me because I was pregnant. Really, I filled out the paperwork when I first arrived 2 hours prior and you're barely noticing you wouldn't be able to see me. You're joking. Not fair. In addition to that when I came back they stated they never received my doctor's approval for my dental work(she didn't even bother to check). Too much of a hassle & I'll have to pass on Western dental from now on. I would never recommend it to anyone.< /text><Rate>1</Rate><Name>Ariyan Miller<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I love Western Dental & Orthodontics. I have been visiting  the one on March Lane,  and for the number of visits I have had,  I give to them five-star. The staff are warm, friendly  and  welcoming. They remind you of your appointments in a timely manner. They treat the patients with respect regardless of race, age, color,  personal ethics and beliefs, just to highlight a few. The doctors and all involved in any kind of procedure approach me with empathy. I  feel I am always at the right place whenever I visit Western Dental & Orthodontics on March Lane.< /review>

<Text>I've gone here for a year or so. A couple months back they pulled my front teeth and made me partial dentures. I cant eat with them, and they never adjusted them. I called the number and a person was supposed to call me to resolve my issue, but never did. I went again to try and get a cavity filled, tiny cavity, they wanted to do a whole root canal and replace my tooth with a crown. Hard no. Will be seeing another dentist.</Text>< pics>

Brought in my son for his appointment, staff and doctors were very friendly. I was a little nervous from things I had heard. I was completely surprised how great everyone was, a bit of wait but they offered coffee and water. The girls in the front were awesome! I would recommend this office to Family and friends.</text>

<Review>This place actually makes me ENJOY going to the dentist! Amazing staff and high quality service. Wait times can be long on busy days, but they let you know ahead of time and offer free coffee during your wait. I used to have an extreme fear of seeing the dentist which I'm completely over now. I had a LOT of work done here and the whole staff was very helpful through it all. My dentist was obviously very experienced and really friendly.

I was originally afraid to go to this place because of the reviews you see on here, but let me tell you that you shouldn't believe them. I have recommended this place to neighbors, friends, and family already. I plan to continue using their services for any future dental work I have done.

New patient. Arrived at 3:15 for my 3:30 appointment. Taken back at 4:15 for xrays. After xrays, waited until 5:30 to see the dentist. Diagnosed with way more cavities than expected. Done with cleaning at 6:00. All in all, a new patient exam and cleaning took nearly 3 hours. Bad experience. Seeking a second opinion from another dentist about the cavities. Won't be back to this practice.<//review>

<review>I've never had a bad experience with this particular Western Dental. Sometimes the wait can be long depending on if you're going for Ortho or general but every visit, I leave very satisfied and never in pain or anything. Once I'm checked in, I get called within 5 minutes so thats never been an issue with me. The staff, dentists, and orthodontists are very professional and are excellent in what they do. I never spend more than 15-20 mins in there (for braces and regular checkups). Very pleased< /review>< pictures>

<text>I had a very bad experience. I go in for a tooth ache, and the dentists say it’s my wisdom tooth, and the procedure would cost me more money than I could afford. Simple enough, I look for other dentists, and I found one that I could afford. I set an appointment with the other dentist.

Western dental then calls me to tell me my assurance had been approved and my extraction would be free, so I cancel with my other dentist and set up a new appointment with them.

I then wait for 3+ hours, x-rays and all, for them to tell me the EXACT SAME INFORMATION they told me the first time. Same price and all. Waste of my time and terrible management. Avoid if you can.< /text>< pictures>

Dr. V was professional and explained the options for my dental work. Jennifer was professional and thoroughly explained my out of pocket costs and what my payment options were. Both provided me with great customer service. I will definitely recommend there office to others.<//Text>

<review>Arrived to the March Lane and Pershing location
I was just put in a waiting queue not super long but not short.
I was told on my last and first visit, the extraction would be done first, makes sense ,since a cracked tooth is why I was visiting.
I explained to them with this cracked tooth in my mouth? hurts.
So not only should it be first ,but was first .
I wasw being preped for cleaning or filling, I kindly stated, I'm just here for the scheduled extraction. if it's not happening today, I think I'm going to take off.
I used Lyft so it cost me to go there. and under the belief that a whole different operation was being done and now they slap me with that.
then they say oh no ,we have  a doctor is here that can squeezes me in , although it was already scheduled so thanks againai guess.,.
cool nurse Ingrid very attentive and cared .
she was lovely,however ,wait till you hear how i left violated and not a dam thing helpfull .
Dr Wu was horrible, very rough carelessly, grabbed a needle ,as if he was mad at me and went into my mouth and stabed deep and hard, so deep it  hit bone,  painfu.
a few minutes he comes back grabs the syringe again, he goes and grabs thea needle again and aggressively stabs my tooth. where I was already numb .

I said to the nurse when he walked away, he was kind of rough he's kind of aggressive and she said to like let him know like to slow up a little bit hold up so then comes back after I'm thinking he just was letting it get now only to pick up the needle again and was going for my mouth and I said oh that's okay sir it's and she but thank you I'm alright he says to me.
I have to do this if you don't let me do it then I'm not going to do the procedure and I said very well and got up and so he got mad and stormed off like I did something to offend him.
I did not feel safe on his hands because he clearly wassnt considerate or patient.

make sure it was numb great okay but painful so then they gave it a few moments and he comes back and was like okay and picks up the needle again and says I want to make sure it's numb .

now I already expressed that he was kind of aggressive and my mouth was clearly numb already ,
I told him I don't know that that's not necessary it's numb.
he got offended and said well then we can't do the procedure if you don't take this third stabij.
so I replied okay then I'll have to reschedule and he stormed off.
Sono tooth extracted ,Dr Wu was very unprofessiona and result of that I didn't get what I needed to get done because he did not trust the customer that actually was the one feeling and hurting.
I don't see how that made sense for him to not want to keep going cuz I didn't want to get stabbed a bunch of more times in my mouth.< /review>< username>

<Text>When I made an appointment for my nephew, who is in my care through the foster system, I asked what documents would be required at the time of the appointment and was assured it would only be his medical card and my ID. Again, I made it clear that I was a foster parent and did not know or have access to his history. I called again before the appointment to double check what I would need to bring and was  again, assured that I would only need his medical card and my ID. When we arrived for the appointment he was refused care because I was not the parent and did not know his medical history. I offered to email or fax proof of his placement with me and was refused. The employees were rude, unwilling to help, and seemed completely ignorant on what, specifically, was required to get him dental care. When I asked for the contact I formation of a supervising manager I was refused. When I attempted to file a grievance online the form would not submit. There was an option to print a grievance form but no information on how to submit that either. The only positive that came of the experience was that my nephew was probably spared from dental work as shoddy as their customer service.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

What is the purpose of making an appointment if your not gonna be seen at that time. It doesn't make sense. Come on now, or time is valuable just like yours.
If u miss your appointment they'll probably charge you. I think we should start charging them for not being seen at out scheduled time.<//Review>< pictures>

So disappointing.  I was so happy yesterday when they told me that they were accepting new patients and that they could get me in the next day.  I arrived 10 minutes early for our 11:00 appointment for a routine x-ray and exam.  After waiting patiently for an hour and 15 minutes past our appointment time, I approached the receptionist.  Asked her about how long she thought it would be until we were seen.  She then told me that there were 3 more patients ahead of us to be taken to a room, that all the rooms were full at the moment and that there were only 2 dentists on duty today and that they were bouncing back and forth between routine exams and issues.  After explaining that I had an appointment I had to keep at 1:15, she suggested that I come back another day for the exam part of the appointment.  I talked to her about the day that my other children would be coming in and she let me know that there were 3 doctors on duty that day and that she could not tell me what kind of wait it could be for the amount of patients that they had on the list for the day.  So, long story short, if you have to use this dentist due to insurance situations, plan to be there for a long time.  I truly felt that there was no respect for the amount of time that any of the patients in that room had waited to be seen, and yes there were a lot of them just sitting around and waiting.<//review>

I went for an infected tooth, the first time I was there I was upset that the dentist and the assistant talked to each other and not me. I felt slighted. I went home sore and miserable after my cleaning also. but on my second visit I was treated by Carol. She took the time to answer ALL MY QUESTIONS and sat down and looked me in the eye and spoke to me directly about what was about to happen and what my follow-up care would consist of. She was very gentle with me. I felt fine when I went home and had no pain at all. I hope I get to see her each and every time. She gave me a new outlook on their facility< /Text>

Horrible customer service. If you have absolutely NOTHING better to do than waste your time and feel like getting upset, come here! Not I! Got here early and then still waited more than 40 min after appointment time to be told that they are "running late, maybe 2, 3 hours maybe more." What?!?!? Western dental, Fired!

Don't be fooled by any good reviews this establishment has. If you actually take the time to read the reviews, you will notice that all the bad ones say stuff pertaining to the actual medical work....i.e. "they pulled the wrong tooth".....and all the good reviews pertain to how nice the staff was i.e. "Ingrid was very nice here's 5 stars"

The reason for this is that in order to raise their horrible rating,  they developed a strategy. The strategy begins at the dental office, where low status employees beg you for good reviews. When you go there, plan on being asked by like 5 people, from the receptionist all the way down to the janitor,  for a good review on google. They approach you with a card in hand, with their name written on it and say "will you please go to google and leave me a good review it really helps?" They do this throughout your appointment, but especially at the start, before you even have anything to base your rating on. They are pretty aggressive about it.

The reason for this behavior is this: if they get enough people to give them five stars because  "Maria was friendly", then hopefully it will drown out the seriously bad reviews,  like "the doctor was careless and rushed through my work, resulting in a new problem tooth that now requires extraction that wasnt neededn before "

This is the strategy that keeps their business afloat. If they didn't actively solicit good reviews for minor things, their whole review page would be full of patients sincerely unhappy with the medical work they received.

I commented about their bad work on a random Facebook group and within a day got 7 likes. Because people who know the truth know this place Is garbage.

If you must go.....absolutely don't let the young Indian or middle eastern girl doctors work on you. These girls have no business being in the dental field, let alone being doctors at all. Beware! Especially if you're poor, because if they think you can't afford  lawyer to get justice, they will  exploit this, and give you rushed,  second hand work.
Literally the worst medical establishment on the face of this earth. They're biggest concern isn't providing patients with good care, but rather rush them through and make the most profit with the cheapest,  fastest work.

This place sucks. And I hope I can save people the pain and suffering of learning the hard way. When it comes to teeth, you want to make sure you have a doctor who cares about their patients,  and these doctors don't fit that description in the least bit.< /Text>

If I could give this place zero stars, I WOULD! My first time was ridiculous. I showed up 20 minutes before my scheduled appointment and wasn't seen till after 50 minutes of my scheduled appointment. The second time coming, I was brought into the hallway entry way where they examined my teeth and later gave me fillings for my third visit. It was uncomfortable because people are constantly walking behide you and there's no privacy! The way the dentist had drill on my teeth caused my teeth to break two days later, while chewing on a PB&J sandwich. The forth visit, I came 20 minutes before my scheduled appointment, filled out paperwork, and sat for an HOUR in the Waiting Room. Clients were being called and once I finally got up and asked what was going on, they said I wasn't going to be seen because it hadn't been 6 months yet. THEY SCHEDULED THE DAMN APPOINTMENT!! Western Dental has been emailing, texting, and calling me to remind me of this appointment and couldn't tell me that they made a mistake?! I'M BEYOND DONE WITH THEIR SERVICE. And the professionalism in this establishment needs improvement-- too many personal conversations that clients can hear while in the Waiting Room.< /Text>

Im not a problematic person.. i made an app went and they called me in i waited for almost 1 hr just to be seen for a consult. And the doctor came in like in a hurry i wanted her to check a took in which i have decay on tooth #14 lingual.. she didnt even use basic instruments to check  or a light to see just said i dont see anything it looks like your tooth color... i know what a decay or cavity is and looks like im a dental assistant...i looked at her and said really so your not going to turn the light or use your mouth mirror and explorer to check she said i been doing this for years i know...i just got up and left because she didn't even seem interested in being there nor in checking my tooth.. western  dental is not the problem.. its the people who work and run it that make the reputation bad.... will never go here again..  it doesn't matter what i say people will still go here...<//review>

Would not even give one star. Very disappointed with appointment. Arrived early for my given time and was told i have an hr to an hr and a half.  Finally was called in and was sent to a room. Took them 1hr to come back in and tell me i still have to wait. I encourage everyone to avoid this establishment. Such a big company but a big let down in service. Wont recommend no one to this place</text>

This is my second review for Western Dental. It feels like my last review was treated with a level of dismisivness which i found irritating, and therefore gave me the desire to write a new review, addressing the issues I have.

First off, I should mention that I do not recommend this business to anyone who cares about receiving quality dental work. Honestly, if I could, I would have given this place a zero out of 5...but 1 is the lowest score I could give. I believe that medical doctors have a responsibility to provide their patients with the best care possible. Doctors get paid a pretty nice paycheck, and even on their worst day, I feel like its their obligation to provide the best quality work to ALL PATIENTS, despite the type of insurance they have, or the financial status of the patient etc.

The funny thing is, there are a million good dentists who provide great quality work. Unfortunately for me (and anyone else who chose this establishment), I picked the one in a million dentist that is actually no good!

Western Dental has responded to my original review, pretty much with a summary of all the good things I said, and several excuses as to why their subprime treatment is actually 100% my fault.

I dont have lawyer money to take Western Dental to court at the moment, but at least I can warn others of this place so they don't have to go through the same thing, and suffer due to a young doctor's neglect.

Ive already told my story herr but in a nutshell: I needed a bunch of extractions.....they specified which teeth needed extractions, and which were salvageable, by drilling and filling them.

They did the drilling/filling first.....and completed it on 2 separate dates. There are two young female doctors there, who I believe are of middle eastern descent.....i mention this because I dont know either of their names....they look like they could be sisters.

The first doctor girl did 3 drilling and fillings on the first appointment. The wait wasn't bad, thr doctor spent a good chunk of time making sure her work was done correctly, like a good doctor. I had no problems with any of her work, and left a happy patient.

The next time, I got 2 drilling and fillings from the other doctor. I do admit, it seems like they are overworked, which could lead to poor work, due to fatigue....but on the other hand, i work construction, and even after 8 physically demanding hours, i can still perform well.

So on this second day....i waited in the DENTIST CHAIR, not the waiting room,  for almost 2 hours. Finally, the second young doctor I previously described appeared, amd began aggressively drilling on my tooth. O was very surprised that these 3 teeth were completed in half the time it took the previous doctor to do 2 teeth. I wonder why that is? Is she just a better faster doctor? Haha, no.....she just didn't care to make sure she had done a good job....especially for a poor medi-cal recipient, who probably wont have the means to complain or sue if anything happens. What I should have done, and encourage anyone who still chooses to risk getting work for western dental, is video taped the procedure.....that way, an irresponsible doctor, or dental office will feel obligated to do a good job, since this would put them under scrutiny. Seriously guys.....your teeth are important....they cost an and a leg to completely replace.....and Western Dental WILL NOT try to make right with you any teeth they destroy....so keep the camera on with these guys.

Anyways.....the next couple days, both the latest fillings fell out. Upon doing a google search, I learned that this is VERY UNCOMMON, and probably due to poor dental work, which fit with my feeling of the work being super rushed.

Later on, the other young doctor girl tried to make excuses for her colleague, placing the blame all on me, but this was later.

Im out of characters....will write a part 2.</review>

Honestly, after going yesterday, my impression has transformed from a positive impression to one that is negative.
Before I go into all that, I want to say the few good things I have to say. Firstly, the dental assistants are very professional,  and did their best to make me feel at home and comfortable. They are the hard workers of this establishment and if this review only pertained to dental assistants such, as Sherryl, Ingrid, or any other dental assistant I worked with, whose name I can't remember, I WOULD GIVE THIS BUSINESS 5 STARS. If the young doctors' practiced the same professionalism of that of their assistants, this would be a great establishment.

Also, and I hope you forgive me for my lack of short term memory, which results in another forgotten name. The lady who takes care of billing and payments was very nice. She also is someone, like the dental assistants, who works in this profession with the desire to help people.....I have bad credit and couldn't qualify for the 6 bone grafts I needed, but got them anyways through a good faith loan from western dental itself. They charged me $1000 for 3 grafts, and the extraction specialist stiched in 6 grafts. Fortunately , I have good parents, and my father payed my bill within a week, for me.
I can't stress enough, that the employees I mentioned above are 5 STAR EMPLOYEES, and I don't want anyone to think that my 1 star rating has anything to do with them,  because it doesn't

So I have to back up to 2 appointments ago, when I was getting remaining filling done on my teeth. I waited in a chair for most 2 hours, when finally the doctor came in. I don't know her name, but she was one of the younger ones. She rushed my fillings in what felt like ten minutes, but could have been longer. Nonetheless, I was very surprised at how fast she finished. It honestly felt very rushed. I'm no dentist, but I don't think she did a very good job, seeing that my first filling fell out within a couple days. The second filling fell out shortly after my tooth extractions, 2 appointments ago.
So yesterday, after almost a whole month of waiting , and walking around with my front 6 top teeth missing, I was very excited to go get the dentures I've been waiting for.  Upon entering the establishment, I was pretty much told that my dentures had been delivered , and my excitement was shared by some of the staff,  whom I had previously dealt with. I was stoked to say the least. I was so happy with the work, that before receiving the dentures, I signed up for another in house loan, for another treatment.....at this point, I was under the assumption that my work was complete, and I was to leave with what appeared to be a full set of straight teeth

A few moments later, the assistant Sherryl informed me of the bad news: There were too many bubbles in the last mold, so actually, the dentures weren't coming today.

Sherryl could tell I was bummed out, and was extremely sympathetic. I appreciated this a lot, knowing none of this was her fault, yet she still felt bad about it. She took new denture molds for me, and made sure they were done right. An older doctor was there, and he seemed disappointed in the matter. It seemed like people were huddled around talking in low voices about my situation. They even had the doctor who did my failed fillings come look in my mouth.
Due to my fillings falling out, I now was going to have to have yet another tooth extracted, one I'm pretty sure did not have to be extracted before hand (or they would have extracted it already).
On top of this, I now have to walk around toothless for one more month, while my new dentures are made, or while my dentures are made for the first time , I don't know.
From what people like my dad tell me, in other dental offices, stuff like this never happens.  He said he's NEVER had a filling fall out, period. I am angry because on top of my insurance paying them, my family also forked over $1000 dollars. Only to result in another extraction. I feel like I should go talk to my family lawyer to learn my rights.< /Review>< Date>

<Review>Was very impressed with the service. I had a million and a half questions...... Jeanette answered them very thoroughly. My ex rays were done my a girl names Kyara, who showed a lot of concern with making sure I was comfortable. Having missing front teeth can be embarrassing, but Jeanette and Kyara both made me feel secure and unembarrassed. Thanks guys, looking forward to getting this work done through you!

They had taken the mold for my dentures, but on delivery day, and in typical Western Dental Fashion, they screwed up the work and had to re do the whole procedure. Also they informed me that they had to now extract a tooth that before "Dr. Negligence" had drilled and filled on.

At this point I left my first bad review....and at first they were super apologetic in the reply to the review. Upon going to Western Dental, some girl, and the better doctor of the two girls kind of cornered me and began questioning me heavily. I felt very uncomfortable and didnt want to talk about it right that second. I felt this was pretty obvious, but they were kind of insistent. That's ok, but here's what Dr. BS told me.

First she tried to say that they never drilled and filled those teeth, period. I guess she was hoping that I was someone with very low intelligence and bad short term memory...
But unfortunately for her, I dont have either of those qualities. Therefore I informed her of the fact that I remembered the procedure perfectly. She tried to argue with me about it a little more, then switched excuses, now saying they did do the fillings, but their strategy is to "try and fill them, not knowing of the cavity is too far gone for it to hold or not....and that if it falls out its just luck of the draw."......now im like wondering "what's going on here? Lol! Is this even a real doctor?"

What kind of doctor would say something, switch stories completely, and then provide false information about the procedure. I know this to be true, because they took several x-rays.....wonder what those are for? Not to determine the size of the cavity? Lol. So I just nodded my head. And she became quiet when I told her that if they intended on extracting the tooth,the would have made the denture to include the tooth that now all the sudden had to be extracted.
What really happened is the first incompetent doctor saw i was a medi cal recipient and therefore rushed through my work. And when you do a bad job on drilling, the fillings fall out. And since she drilled so much out, now I lost a tooth that would cost 4 grand to replace.
I took my dentures and left. Im not letting these doctors who dont seem to know what they're doing or atleast dont care touch my teeth ever again.

So yesterday i get a grievance packet thing from western dental. First they mentioned how I "commented that the staff were exceptionally nice and professional etc"

I only commented these things, because every time you go there, the staff practically beg you to leave them a review. Out of 4 times or so ive gone there, ive been asked to leave around 20 reviews. Its so crazy that in one visit, ill leave with 4 or 5 cards with staff names written on them. On different visits the same staff members would ask me again. The reviews are whats most important to these people....over providing good work, they are more concerned with you leaving a review.....asking you in the first five minutes before even providing any care. Thats the only reason i left those comments. I mean ya the staff was cool but nothing so amazing id leave a review lol.

Then they said that the reason I sat in the dental chair was because i was late. I dont think i was late, but if i was,it was less than 5 mins late and didnt warrant having to sit in a DENTAL CHAIR NOT THE WAITING ROOM for more than 2 hours.

Then they tried to say oh your tooth has to now be extracted and we've made you a new denture....like making extra dentures is something they do all the time,and not because they screwed up by over drilling my tooth resulting in a new tooth that didnt have to be extracted until Dr Incompetent went to work on it.

Or are you saying "we dont regard the xrays.....we tried to drill and fill to see if it might work, and went ahead and made your dentures without checking to see if it did in fact, work.
I do need to try to contact an injury lawyer because these guys are really shady. And i hope people read my comments and try a different place. I mean there's some places out there that take medi-cal that are really good.</review>

I must say my experience here today was surpassed!  Initially I was hesitant to book the family of four on my day off, we where out just in three hours and have returning appointments. Awesome job by front desk Cynthia and Dedey, also Jeanette and Melinda's help during exams with Dr. Seri, Dr. V, and Hygienist Hira is much appreciated. Can't forget about the Dental Assistant Saly, and Kiara. One of the people who makes us feel comfortable to keep coming back is the X-Ray Tech Roy, he is fast and gentle. As my 3 1/2 year old son says, "thumbs up!!"< /Text>

Had the worst experience back in 2013, hence my not returning there. The dentist was rude, condescending & made me feel less than human. I was in the period of recovery for a double mastectomy & this experience I DID NOT NEED. I'm trying the Western Dental on West Lane hoping I have a better experience but looking over the reviews I'm not really too hopeful. Why is the cooperation so inept & displaying such unprofessional conduct? I'm going to send letters to the Corporate office to get an explanation of the horrible service issue. Had to give it one star because you cannot post without marking a star. It truly deserves - - - - - Stars</review>

If 0 stars were an option, I would choose it. From all the times I had to go here for things such as fillings or a crown, I was forced to wait for more than 3 hours each time. If it were up to me I wouldn't go to this facility anymore. The dentists there seem to lose track of the patients and it's quite annoying to see them pass by my chair every 10 minutes without second glance over to me, as if I'm not a priority. I go here, I miss school, my parents miss work, and for what, to wait for over 3 hours for them to do nothing? I would never recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

Western dental SUCKS! This place should just get shut down. Waited for so long, they pulled out one of my wisdom tooth, barley even numbed me and when the doctor pulled out my teeth, i could feel it rip off! I hate this place so much! I was in tears and they just kept going. Never again go there.</Text>

<review>I wouldn't have given any star if I could. This place is the Worst Dentist! One receptionist was super rude when we when we went there. I get that every one has a bad day so I dont hold it against her. I don't know what she was going through in her personal life. But I thought it was worth mentioning.
When my mom went in to her apt the Dentist, or surgeon was Terrible!!!!! He numbed her and Imediately after numbing her he started to cut out her tooth. Not even allowing the medicine to work. Then when she made noises because, it was Hurting... He told her to be quiet because she is scaring other patients!!! Can you believe that? She said she felt like he was heartless and didn't care at all that she was in pain. He didn't even stop!!!! He even left HALF OF A TOOTH IN!!! Yes!!! He removed half and left the other half inside... We are currently looking for another dentist office... I will NEVER recommend western dental. Not even to my worst enemy!!!! I'd rather pay out of pocket then to go here even if this was the only place that accepted my insurance!!!!
I hope that no one ever experiences what my mother went through!!!! It's Dental Care not Dental DONT Care!!!!</review>< gmap_id>

< review>
Went in to get one tooth taken out, one! You would think this would be a no brainer for a dentist to pull a tooth that was causing me so much pain because of an exposed nerve I was in tears! After waiting 3 hours, I was told they couldn't pull it that day AND it would be 2 WEEKS before they would because they wanted to take out my bottom wisdom teeth at the same time. You would think they would have pulled the tooth there and then, then delt with the wisdom teeth at a later date! The office manager was rude, and dressed like a hooker. She became even more rude and belligerent when i declined the extra services they suggested and said i did not want to apply for care credit, and on top of that, she wanted me to sign forms giving them permission to bill my insurance for the extractions even though they hadn't done them.  Not only am I leaving this review to warn others of their obscene conduct, but I'm also filing a complaint with the California dental board.  This office was dirty, rude, and unforgivable!</review>

The only i knew of this was because i heard them talking about doing it. Then i sat there for 20 minutes to finely get told to sit in another chair to wait another 15 minutes.

<Text>Last month I had a SCHEDULED appointment at 10:15 am, waited for about a 45 minutes to have x-rays done, then waited for a bit over 4 HOURS to just be placed in the back to have been told what work needed to be done then had to wait another 45 minutes to have had NOTHING done! I had an anxiety attack because of the waiting while the staff calmly had conversations about how one of them "looked different because they had gotten a haircut before their return." I spent my entire day there and skipped class. The staff is horrible, all they do is have conversations with each other, judge each other, and walk around the plaza as well. I walked out at exactly 2:45 because I wouldn't have had a ride home. That was the second chance I had given them. THIS IS THE WORST DENTAL PLACE IN STOCKTON, clearly NEVER returning.</Text>< user>

<Text>I had the worst experience ever .This is the first time I'm writing a review for anything because I don't ever want other people to make the same mistake I did by going to this place. Just a brief background, I went to western dental because my new job only offered this prepaid insurance and that means I can't go to my awesome dentist (dr.pulido) because that would mean I would need to pay out of pocket coz he only accepts PPO. I only needed cleaning every 6 months, so I figured why not just go to western dental since its near my place and I dont really have extensive dental problem.WORST DECISION EVER. I felt like this place is a scam! Waited 30 mins to get an xray and waited over an hour to be seen by the rudest dentist I have encountered Dr. MY HUYNH.I am a very patient person and the least demanding patient a doctor can have I know that because im a nurse myself, but this doctor is just plain rude.I waited for over an hour which does not make sense because thats why you have an appointment so you dont have to wait that long and when she came she didnt even introduce herself and made me feel uncomfortable she was talking to me like im an inferior and ignorant person.The only information she provided me was the obvious one,I knew I had tartar thats the reason why I went to the dentist for my 6th month cleaning like I routinely do,every 6 mos.She diagnosed me with gingivitis, really?ok that i may need to clarify with my trusted dentist..but then she got the nerve to tell me  I need braces too because I don't floss enough and she said my teeth was cramped together, I felt that she was just trying to squeeze me for my money and she said all this stuff in a very rude manner.Talk about customer service.Felt like I was getting scammed right? Then I was surprised that shes leaving and I asked her,"so were not going to do the cleaning?" (the only reason why I was there in the first place)she said the first meeting is always a consultation and will set an appointment for the treatment, I was never informed that the first visit would be a consultation only , dont you think that would be something important to inform the patient?at the back of my mind I was like are you kidding me, after all this wait? I have never experienced this going to my regular dentist. And the assistant told me that I need to pay $622 out of pocket for cleaning because its not covered by insurance im like really?I thought it is covered every 6 mos, and they said that because its a different kind of cleaning,it requires gingival irrigation or something like that. I came there for cleaning and they did all these services that I didnt even asked for I wasted a few hours of my life going here.They charged my insurance $504 for nothing. This place should be shut down, all they care about is how to get the maximum money out of their patient. None of the staff knows what they are doing, the place is not well maintained and unsanitary IMO. Ive been with my regular dentist for 5 years and never did he require me to do any of the listed services above, i know for sure my regular dentist would warn me ahead of time if i needed these procedures done. Its like going to a mechanic asking for an oil change picking up the car with new tires and engine. After this experience im going back to my regular dentist even though I have to pay out of pocket. TO EVERYONE DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME GOING TO WESTERN DENTAL BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT GET THE DENTAL SERVICE THAT YOU NEED AND DESERVE IMO.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I called and talked to someone over the phone to help me find the next available appt. and they were very nice and helpful. i called back at another time to the actual place on March Ln. in Stockton Ca. to cancel my appt. and was transferred to another line to talk to someone else but they just hung up on me after that i tried calling again to tell them i was disconnected and i heared the girl answer the phone and then hang it up... i called once again and she finally answers to tell me she is helping a patient and if was ok if i was placed on hold. i told her yes that was fine. I work in customer service and i can not believe how rude she was to just hang up on me and not just take a quick second to put me on hold. i am very understanding and am willing to work with any situation but to not get the same treatment in return when i haven't even done anything to them to deserve that really pisses me off. i can see why a lot of people have nothing nice to say about western dental. Maybe they need to check their staffs attitude when helping customers in stressful environments or youll be losing a lot more people each day including me.!!!!< /Review>

<text>Giving one star is even too much!!!
I don't understand how you schedule appointments and people are still here 3 hours after their scheduled time!!! If you don't have 12 hours of time to dedicate in one day, DONT MAKE AN APPOINTMENT HERE!

I've had a scheduled appointment 3 times now and it takes hours for them to call you. The first time I waited and it was about an hour and a half before I was called back JUST for X-rays. The second appointment I got called back and was supposed to get numbed for an extraction and that didn't even happen. An hour later they told me my mouth should have felt numb a long time ago. Well yeah it probably would have if you guys would have came in here to do it. So I left and rescheduled just to come back today and have been waiting an hour and a half and still nothing! I asked if they have a problem with overbooking people and I was told no. Then she told me I could come back next Tuesday (the day the oral surgeon is in the office) at 8:30am. So I said alright, would I be the only one scheduled for that time? She says no theres 2 other people also scheduled for 8:30. WTH!!!! That is overbooking!!! I'm so over this place. I will be looking for a different office in the future!!!< /text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Good food. I had a combo Pho and Bún Bò Huế (in 2 visits). Very good broth and meat quality over all. The BBH should have more "chả" (a kind of Vietnamese meat ... loaf?) and less chili oil. I like how they put a lot of green onion</text>

Been coming here for YEARS and never once been disappointed. The broth is super flavorful and the staff always has a smile on their faces. The family that owns this place is super friendly -- even on those crazy busy days where it would be easier to be a jerk. Great people. Great food. Great prices!<//Text>

Customer service was bad!
Cashier / hostess / whatever she was, was rude and curt! If she's not happy with her station in life, I hear Del taco or Walmart is hiring
The food was average, if that!

Hands down best Phõ in LA. Beef is super soft, broth is delicious and no complaints here. They have the best customer service. Someone will always ask if everything is okay and ask if you need anything. Love this place!!</review>

This small restaurant goes above and beyond in providing the same taste & experience from home. Although I tremendously miss eating here, the take out experience is great. Upon the pickup and eating our food at home the food was warm, fresh and served correctly. The order process was quick and easy! Please support local business during COVID-19</review>< user>

Nice atmosphere (repurposed Korean BBQ restaurant with intimate tables) owned by a wonderful Chinese family, a little bit "hood" on the outside but the service inside is great. Maybe about a dollar or two above your common bowl of pho, but the portions are great, the cuts in the tendon are thick and the slab of thin sliced onion is a great touch.</review>

Great place in the Inner Sunset. Close to UCSF and that's amazing because you can just walk down to 9th Avenue and yes you can eat your Vietnamese food. I usually get Spice Chicken with Garlic Noodles because I love their garlic noodle. It's really good!!!< /Review>

Their beef combo soup is one of my go tos as well as their seafood one. The only thing I would say they need is to hire an extra person. There’s always only 2 ladies on the floor doing everything so sometimes you have to wait around. Aside from that I really enjoy this place!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Should be called best Pho Ever! 😍😍😍 Met the owner's daughter while she was working,  she completely stopped what she was doing to talk to me and my sister for like 10 minutes while we were waiting for our food. She was very friendly, we talked about amazing little hole-in-the-wall spots just like this one. This place is definitely a sit-down experience! They have cute little booths where are you have privacy for you and your date.. or with friends 😊 highly recommend!!< /Review>< pictures>

Great service! The Pgo broth is DELISH! and, the prices are very reasonable. The parking is poorly lit and there is several pot holes. This does not take away from my 5 stars. The food is that good.<//review>

I love this place. The food is great. They might want to consider hiring 1-2 people for wekends. The owner needs customer service training. This rating is solely based on the food and the servers.<//Text>

and they also cater to Vegans and it's delicious! Highly recommend!
Chicken was not the usual thin sliced, dried breast meat. It was juicy, thick pieces and double the serving. I got the rice plate but they make the same chicken for the sandwich, salad and the pho.
Didnt get a picture because I was surprised by the plate that was given to me.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b594473f39f3:0xdff6d8f2be8f7d09< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place by far the best place, it has a nice set up. The food I order was really good as I expected. The noodle broth was well balance and has that nice soothing flavor, that's the first thing I do before I eat it. Is to taste the broth first to see how the flavor is before I eat the noodle. The spring roll was well nicely done, it was nice and fresh I can taste the freshness. The reason why gave it a (5 stars) Because as food critic there's things you look for when you dine in.

1). As you walk in how is the atmosphere and set up like.
2).Greeting and service.
3).The menu was nicely done.
4). Ordering was properly taken care of.
5). The food was really good and flavorful.

I order the special spring roll and spicy noodle (Bun Bo Hue) and my friend order the combination Pho noodle which he was complimenting how good it was on our way there. We were really satisfied. And I would really recommend it to friends and families if they're around the area. My next try is the (Hot Pot) .

<text>I'm not going to say as much as I'd like, I'll keep it short. I'm a traveler and I've been to many places that serve pho. Hands down the best I've had! I'm rarely in awe of things, but this food left me speechless. To make things more astonishing, I ordered it online. I wish I hadnt decided to be lazy and actually ubered to the restaurant. I will definitely go next time. I will never Pho get this food 😍🤣😂< /text>< Pics>

Horrible service. After waiting for a hour I had to leave because my lunch was over. Food never came out. Not once asked if I'd like some water or told when the food was coming. I sat there like an idiot waiting for something that wasn't coming. I'd give it negative rebiews if I could. Plus, I'm pretty sure I saw something crawl across the floor. I'll be letting the health department know.</text>

Delicious....tender tender beef stew noodle soup and also egg roll w pork rice vermicelli.  Lunch specials. Unsweeten Ice tea could be stronger but that's me I like strong.  Stew only minor issue lil much oil due to beef otherwise excellent flavor.  We mention it to the owner.  Some people like to dip their french bread or w rice.  But w soup better to remove some of oil only my personal opinion each it's own of course.  But please do try it it's VERY GOOD regardless!! Owner and his daughter and the others all so very courteous and they take care of you.   Enjoyed it there very much as our first time.  We are coming back.< /text>

Food is ok; price to spensil needs; if ask for any extra ingredients they charge extra money if you request spacy food is extra charge; if you ask for anything is extra charge if you request any thing for your soup they charge you; if you request te, in the pot they only give you one bag for three people, and they put only hot water 2 o 3 times for over $3.00 I have been in many restaurants vietnamese, and I never get charge for all this and the te is natural hervs and I pay only $1.00 and all the te you want to drink</text>

Their spring rolls are so good; perfectly hot and fluffy and crunchy. Wrap them on lettuce and dip them on sauce, perfect. And the Pho, soup is just right, and fresh veggies on the side. All for a great, reasonably cheap price.< /Text>

The Pho here isn't bad at all compared to all the other Pho places in South Bay area. I will only go there if I don't want to drive all the way to Little Saigon for cheap and quality Pho. The restaurant is very clean and customer service is good. They always have special Groupon/Living Social/Yelp deals from time to time.< /text>

I totally got excited about $5 off. Apparently it's 5$ off of $30 purchase before tax.

Food is okay. Not the best I've had but better than average. The rice plate comes with a fried egg instead of a egg loaf if you're looking for the egg loaf.

Service was a little spotty even though there weren't that many customers when we came in for dinner. Even with multiple staff, it took a couple of tries to get extra fish sauce.<//Text>

Pho was ok. They don't have many condiments, like your usual salt and pepper or even fish sauce for the pho broth. No sugar either. Their spring rolls are tasty.< /review>

<Text>Simple but satisfying pho broth would make you happy.

I believe pho has to be simple but rich broth. That's what you get here. When I sipped the soup first, I thought the soup lacks bit of flavor. but as I eat more, I discovered the broth is quite flavorful.

The lunch special comes with an eggroll. I like that bonus.

I haven't eaten any other food, so I don't know, but I would certainly try them when I come here next time.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Got the tofu Bahn Mai sandwich and it was the worst one I have ever had. Mostly bread stuffed with fried and strangely breaded tofu and fried noodles with tiny bits of pickled vegetables. Couldn't have more than half of this tasteless sandwich. My daughter had a chowmin dish which seemed ok. Not going back</Review>< Time>

We often run into flavorless, dry, and tough meat in some pho establishments - not here. The broth is good, though we prefer a more robust (almost pork) flavor, the meat is fresh and so very tender. The rolls are excellent and totally filled us up before the pho arrived. The seating is pretty cool - there are private room booths that add to the comfortable, yet lively ambience.  Do yourselves a favor and treat yourselves to this place.< /Review>< pics>

<text>The pho here was pretty average. Can get comparable bowls throughout the area. But the surprise of the meal was the house special spring rolls. I believe they had homemade sausage in there and these crispy fried egg roll skin thingies. This combination made these spring rolls memorable. Too bad the pho couldn't compare. Would comeback if the pho were better.< /text>< GmapID>

Love the Pho. Pair with Gỏi cuốn, which is served warm and hot (not spicy) peanut dipping sauce. A treat! And a Vietnamese iced coffee and you've gotta be sadistic not to grin cheek to cheek!<//Review>
