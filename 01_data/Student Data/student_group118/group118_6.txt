< Review>
Go ask me. I think they are out of money to improve.  And should change to a shopping mall or something instead, because the address is in the middle of the intersection of that area.  And I think people shouldn't did too negative effort on posting disgust issue though.  Most of all, that is a house/apt or somebodies home.  If you really help, you can just write couple of sentence show how upset you are than you have to process and take those important problem issue to Public authorities to handle it.  PERHAPS COMPLAINT TO APT.MAGAZINE something and cause or make some pressure on those issue and push them change?????????????????????? Some other place in USA is much even worst.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Don't Lease with Emerald Pointe, You will surely Regret it! I've been a resident in this complex for a few years, & it has been miserable! It's a serious Problem finding decent Affordable Housing, & its a SAD Prevalent situation.. Needless to say my experience @ Emerald Pointe is No Good.👎 I've had Housing inspections every year, and they FAIL everytime. They do get a Re-Inspection to bring things to code, at which they usually do minimum repairs that mask the problem, They Don't Fix the underlying issues. The Office Managers Are Not Good & unwilling to resolve any problems or communicate effectively with their clients. Manager: Aglae (not sure if that name is correct) & her Assistant manager are Extremely UN-Professional. They display poor management skills, & Neglect to show Dignity to the tenants. (Opposite of the false claims that praise them.) The Buildings itself are in Bad condition varying From: Bed Bugs, Mites, Roaches, Fleas, etc.. To: Dry Rot, Black Mold, Leaking Ceilings, Rotten Walls/ Windows/ Rooftops, peeling & cracking paint & baseboards [VIEW photos *current, & unedited]. The Outside Grounds are Dangerous (Large Fallen Trees Break, & often result in property damage & can potentially hurt a person.) Huge parts of the complex flood quickly. I've slipped multiple times stepping in Dog feces & thick slimy Mud because of the flooding, to get to & from my unit. (There is No other way around this inconvenient mess..) Pools are rarely Open in Summer seasons & turn Green from No up-keep. Laundry Facilities don't ever work properly. Personal Property of mine has been damaged due to Mold in my unit. Things like furniture, clothing, etc. ALL in all since living here, I've suffered from rashes, memory confusion, tiredness, & other symptoms of illness. (I think my unit maybe a partial factor) The Only way EMERALD POINTE would deserve a 3.3 Star Rate or above would be if it got "TORN DOWN & Rebuilt" from the bottom up & that includes the office Management staff...< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Having lived next to there for 28 yrs. I would never recommend this place to my worse enemy. The trash that they rent to, wanna be gangbangers, druggies, prostitutes etc. Migrate to my condos. To trash,  steal, drink n do their drugs. And for years every summer dealing with them abusing our pool. They say there 2 pools were closed last year and looks like this year too. So we go anywhere from 2 -20 ppl coming over trespassing. From smart ass kids to gangbangers, to kids,parent, and grandparents all coming at once. They've been dealt with here from the cops and on. I tried going over to there and talk with the management about helping to do something. Yea right. I've got every tenants pic or a video of them over here that i was gonna pass on to next door. Well desk person gave me there site to send the pics. Tried for 2 weeks almost every day. Site was no good. so here i am. I'm gonna try again tomorrow with the new pics and see what they say. I've got 50-75 pics of their tenants. Had them come after me physically, Try to surround me , to fight till a friend of mine showed. Had them go after my daughter as shes walking her dog. Enough is enough. These are from today. some of them had to deal with last year too. Pics don't show the scooter that they were riding into the pool and left. Sry in pieces now. If i get the same help as last year look for more pics of all the trespassers. Who knows maybe i'll have some of the cops dealing with them< /Text><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809051302e5cd73b:0x4edccbe740367628< /gmapID><time>1498180216307<//time><UserId.>106071821186446258270< /UserId.>< pictures>

<review>Thing that really really impressed me was the professionalism of the staff.  My niece who is a first time renter was not familiar with all the forms that needed to be completed in the process to determine eligibility for this complex.  The assistant manager took the needed time to explain each from and make sure she understood what is was signing, as opposed to just saying " sign here"  As a her 57 year old aunt really appreciated that.

Thankfully, she was approved....I feel that she has found a clean, safe and affordable place to call home.< /review>< pictures>

Emerald Pointe I’ve been a resident sense 2016 . Thanks  for keeping my apartment comfortable and livable.   Ive had several work orders put in to have repairs done in my apartment and all of my orders where done in a quick timely manner .
I personally wanna thank the repair guy whom was very professional, I forgot his name but he recently repaired a total of 4 things that I requested to be fix . In addition he repaired something I did not have on the work order and I truly appreciate him for going the extra mile to help keep my apartment comfortable.
Also thanks to all the managers in the front office for the great hospitality that you’ve shown to my daughter and myself .
Ps  , it would be great if you upgraded the park area  and have the drainage issue fixed .

Thank you .<//Review>

<Review>I can not express how grateful I am for Emerald. The ladies in the front have went above and beyond for my client's looking for an apartment. I highly recommend this complex. Nayeli and the other two ladies are patient, professional and SUPER HELPFUL. They made us feel welcomed, comfortable and like they truly cared about our need of an apartment. I would rate 100 stars if I could!!!< /Review>< date>

Marie is definitely lying. She must be friends with some of the staff cause this is most definitely not a good place to raise a family. The other poster is right. There is ghetto and trashy people but they put them all in the back of the complex with the old handicapped people and other weirdos. When I say ghetto people i'm talking about ghetto from all races. Dogs aren't even supposed to be allowed but there's plenty of people walking with their dogs and you can hear the dogs barking all times of the day and night. It's so annoying. I know some people have service dogs but trust me the majority of the dogs here aren't. Then you got tenants and their friends continuously parking in other people's covered parking spaces even when there are signs around the complex stating unauthorized vehicles will be  towed. They have no night security like they used to and no security cameras like they said they would have. Granted things are a little better than they used to be which isn't saying much. I can't wait to move from here which will be very soon.</Text>

The outside of the apartments looks great, the inside of the units needs some updating. However, with all the amenities and with upgrades you possibly sale the units and attach HOA's  for property upkeep<//review>

The temperature has been extremely high and both pools are closed.!!!! All the girls in the front keep saying when we go ask is they'll open later, yeah right! I'm sure they didn't pass inspection. I've been through this with them before. And that's one of the amenities that emerald is supposed to offer & also maintenance takes forever to do anything and that manger is never in the office and when she is she's "too busy" to help or even listen to a concern one of us has.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809051302e5cd73b:0x4edccbe740367628</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Asked to have our dishwasher fixed almost a month ago now. Since you guys shut your phones off and don't respond to emails. I'll just give you a 1 star review whenever I'd like for you guys to actually do your job over there. I know it must be so difficult, sitting in an office all day. Nice renovations by the way, you should fix the actual apartments instead of where you guys hang out all day. Fix our Dishwasher! Quit the fake ass reviews too</review>< Rate>

And it doesn't have to be this way if the staff had pride and dignity in their work. They'll do the absolute bare minimum and if it weren't for keeping things up to code, this place would be a dump. Allowing dead branches to sit on rooftops is not a decor / fashion statement I want to be part. I hope the owners read this post, please start caring more, if not sell to new ownership and go find a bare minimum job, like being a YouTuber. Thanks</Review>< pictures>

They need more maintenance men. But for a low income apartment complex, it's decent. They try to get to their work orders as fast possible.<//review>

Have been a resident for a few years I am one who mind my business and stay to myself I pay my rent on time and never have received a complaint ..I have seen many changes aground here and yes it looks nice but it would be nicer if we can occupy that pool that also looks nice IN this heat wave its Modesto its hot out here we have two swimming pools AND both are down why did you spend all that money on making the place look nice and not on a pool guy too fix the pool thats been broken for as long as I've lived here....or how ABOUT our ac unit's in this heat with no pool AND no air conditioner what repairs DID you do to benefit the residents I am very upset AND I really feal sorry for the staff around here who work hard to run this place that have to hear all of our complaints<//Review>

I cant say all positive things of Emerald pointe apartments, but what i can say is that this place is changing the old management was just horrible new management is doing a really good job cleaning up the place, What before was a drug dealing frenzy is slowly becoming a pretty nice place to live I have only lived here a year and i can honestly say things are changing for the better yes this place still has a lot to work on but coming a long way. The manager and staff are friendly sometimes hard to get a hold of but Ive seen myself how crazy that office gets. All and all you get what you pay for so unless you have the cash to pay for a Ritz I wouldn't complain!<//text>

The people in that office are lazy and rude and get paid to absolutely do nothing. God forbid an emergency happens and you can't get no help because voicemail is full. You girls need to be reported and replaced!<//Text>

<Review>If I can give this place negative stars I would. This is horrible I've been a resident for years and everything takes forever to get done. The manager is never in the office she is always out sick, on vacation, or busy that can't help anyone out. I received a 3-day for no reason and when I call to address the issues the manger is not their I make an appointment with her and I go and she is gone for the day. This place sucks and I'm glad I'm moving out soon. The maintenance people do take forever to do work orders and all the girls in the office say is to wait because they have over 100 work orders and are backed up. Management should hire more maintenance people since this is a big property.</Review>< Resp>

I would like to start by saying that new management is really doing a great job! the girls in the office are always friendly and ready to help maintenance is also great! they all do a great job!! no complains what so ever! the only thing that I could say they could improve is some of the amenities their gym is currently not open due to no safe equipment as well as playground, one of the main reasons I moved here was because of the pools and big play area for kids. It wasn't until a couple months I moved in I realized the playground was in really bad shape I don't let my kids play in it because I'm scared they will get hurt. When I went to the gym I was told it was closed temporary due to the equipment being old and non functional which made me really upset that was another reason I moved in hopefully they can take care of that soon and this place will have it all!!<//text>

Small, roach infested apartments in a gang controlled area. Between noisy, fighting neighbors and a charge-you-a-rediculous-fee-for-anything office, I could only recommend this place to a hated enemy. Unfortunately you can't give negative stars. As soon as our lease is up we are history.  UPDATE: They just started locking people out of the mailroom. Requires a key that no one has. WORST MANAGEMENT EVER.
NEW UPDATE: Feb.-16, They've just started mandatory "Annual" inspections every three months. The wording on the notices are very vague. Look, all you have to do is look at the place in person, you'll see. While your here, come check out my patio fence, that pretty much says it all. (apt. 235)
Plus, they never answer their phone.< /text>

Absolutely disgusting place to live. It's covered in black toxic mold, dry rot, ticks, fleas, gnats, mosquitoes, carpet beetle larvae, silverfish, and if that isn't bad enough? Some units even have bed bugs! Do not move THERE.  And i can verify every fact. I've got proof. And filing a class action lawsuit< /Review>

DO NOT MOVE HERE

I haven't even moved in yet. I put the $100 deposit on an apartment that opens in August 1 month ago and  I am already incredibly unsatisfied and out of $100.

1. When I filled out the application for the apartment and put my $100 deposit I made it clear that I was going to continue to look for another place because I wanted to move in sooner than August. I specifically asked if I would be refunded my $100 if I did find another home. I was told the only thing non-refundable is the $35 credit check.

2. No one disclosed any of the criminal activity that has recently happened at Emerald Pointe to me. Modesto Police Department confirmed that in the last 4 weeks there has be 2 gang related assults, 2 car thefts, and 1 burgulary. How can you feel good about renting to a single mom and her 2 kids and not feel that it is necassary to disclose this kind of information - especially violent crimes.

3. When I called and asked about getting my $100 refunded, the property manager got rude and told me that because my application was already approved she didn't HAVE to give the $100 back - making it sound like she could, but wasn't going to. When I asked if I could talk to her manager she told me she was the manager. When I asked for the information regarding who owns Emerald Pointe she told me she would not disclose that information. WORST COSTUMER SERVICE.

I'm out $100, but at least myself or my family wasn't caught in the crossfire of any criminal activity. You can tell by looking at these apartments that they don't have much to offer - they intice you with the two pools, basketball court, and play ground that you probably wouldn't be safe using. I tried to give them some credit for being under new management but was quickly proven wrong in doing so - these apartments are still the dump everyone says they are. I'm just relieved I found this out prior to moving in.</text>

Hardly any maintenance crew on site to fix any amenities in residents homes. When an amenitie needs to be fixed the office staff takes forever before having someone come out and fix it.  Trees are constantly falling in the apartment complex, falling over into people's porches or in the walkways. Children's playground is not safe, a child fell off a slide & another child fell off the monkey bars, due to paint being on it, resulting in an injury.</review>

I just moved to California and have been looking for a good car repair shop for a 2005 Saab. 4Car had good reviews on Yelp so I thought I’d try it. They were honest and reasonably priced, were able to recommend some strategies for getting the car working.

All good.<//text>

Four Car Garage has always been very helpful in dealing with any of my car maintenance needs. They walk you through any questions and provide options with clear explanations. I'm happy to recommend them to friends and family.</Text>

The best car repair for our 2011 GMC Yukon Denali . They did a real good job on our vehicle . The owner Jennifer and manager Albert were so professional and very accommodating. They even provided us with a car while they were repairing our vehicle . They also repaired it so quickly and correctly. I highly recommend there repair shop for any foreign and domestic vehicles . Lastly we were so happy with the price !!<//Text>

It took about an hour and a half and when they were done they had a very detailed report on everything I could expect from the car in the next several years.
I cannot overstate how much this mechanics shop is helped in deciding to purchase my first vehicle. Bonus points for so much hybrid knowledge for a small family business!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I came in due to all the great reviews of this place.  I would go back and will go back despite them finding another major problem as I was already about to pay my Bill. I was not prepared I wished I had warning before I headed back. It would have prepared me further.< /review><Date>1621885082327< /Date><Rating>4</Rating></record>

They gave me a loaner car. Went in for front brakes on Rav4. They did brake inspection, checked fluids and car air cabin filters. My check engine light they took care of. Called me for my approval for oil change, yes. Price was more than fair for all the work they did. Called me last hour of time it would be ready. Will go in future for all car repairs. Very courteous and clean. They even alcohol wiped my credit card before and after.<//text>< Date>

Albert was very efficient on updating me with every single job they did on my car. It was my first time there at 4 Car Garage and will definitely go back there for any mechanical needs for my car in the future. Satisfied with what they did. Staff were great and easy to work with. Thanks to you 4 Car Garage👍👍Awesome job!! Margaret K<//Review>

They performed a pre-purchase inspection on a used car I was considering buying.  They were able to inspect the car on short notice.  They were very friendly and thorough.  Albert was wonderful.  They discovered that the car was corroded and had other problems.  They provided an oral report, a paper report and photos.  They saved me from buying a dud.  I plan to use them again during my hunt for a used car.</Review>

<Text>Working with Albert and Jennifer on two separate maintenance issues was so smooth and comfortable.  I oddly have this mindset that every mechanic is out to "get you" and make you pay up for unnecessary maintenance, so I'm a little cautious whenever I bring my car in to a shop.  Albert and Jennifer were extremely professional, laid out the facts of my maintenance issues, and presented detailed quotes in a manner that was not pushy and felt extremely honest and transparent.  Not only did they provide this information in a comfortable manner, but their shop performed the work quickly and at the slightest hint of a delay they were quick to offer a loaner vehicle which was so appreciated, not necessary in my case, but their willingness to offer was unlike any other mechanic I've worked with.  If you want a friendly, honest, quality, and expeditious car maintenance experience, you absolutely need to head to 4 Car Garage!<//Text><gmapID>0x808f9df49eb5aac7:0x72b69555391e955< /gmapID><user_id>114711528723594435538< /user_id><Name>Matthew Evans<//Name><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

We have trusted the team at Four Car for many years. They handle anything we need for our Acura and Audi. They are upfront with their pricing, make honest recommendations, and communicate clearly. They are a family run business, and care about their customers. Although no one likes to spend money on car repairs, they make it pleasant and as painless as possible.<//text>

Good Family Owned Business for many years in Burlingame. Recently moved to this location in the last 2 years taking over for PK Automotive (Fred and Sherry retired).  Jennifer is very courteous, professional and responsive with her Tech team. Gives you the straight story and will tell you what recommendations should be done on a case by case basis. My particular experience with them over the past 2 years has involved my commuter car 1999 BMW 323i. Mostly oil changes, a brake job, filter change outs ....keeping the car running... I appreciated that. Definitely valued the relationship and supporting a strong Local Business and will look to bring business back to them soon. Strongly recommend if you have a vehicle that is beyond your extended warranty and need a good place to do general maintenance. They work on all brands.< /text>

<Text>I don't live in the area any longer and I used to take my vehicle to "Auto Medics" for many MANY years. They were amazing and sadly closed up shop and moved on. I will miss Chris & Robert.

I'm leaving a review for 4 car garage because of my recent phone conversation with Jennifer. I called the old Auto Medics number (not knowing they closed) and it rang over to 4 Car Garage. I was so confused at first but then found out they'd purchased the customer list and records from Auto Medics. Now hold on there before you start crying foul. They essentially purchased the business. This happens all the time. It just so happens they didn't acquire the physical location though. This is a very smart move because Auto Medics customers were EXTREMELY LOYAL - they knew they could trust the expertise and intentions of Auto Medics.

After spending some time talking with Jennifer about various things (for nearly 45 minutes!) it became very apparent that they are continuing in the exact same manner Auto Medics operated. The same helpful, honest, & knowledgeable professionalism.  Sure wish they were like that where I live now!<//Text>< pictures>

TI stop here everyday on my morning walk. They are very friendly despite what other review might say. I think people who use phrases like "low key rude", should really learn to write reviews accurately.<//Review><UserId.>116914820560384352058<//UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< time>

The couple that runs this place are simply awesome people, always a smile, and always happy to help. Process don't compare to a large chain market, but they are still reasonable, and have a fairly wide selection. What you pay in slightly higher prices, you will save in gas if you are a local in small community of Nuevo, CA.</review>< GmapID>

The Nuevo Market has always been the go to place and will ALWAYS be from here on out. One of the times I went in to this Expressway market, the guy behind the counter seemed very accommodating to the gentleman in front of me as he ask for matches or if they sold them, when I got to the register his behavior was quit disturbing towards me, I believe I even double checked myself thinking maybe it was a bad tee shirt day or something? I was fine, it was all this mans disturbing attitude towards women that seemed to be an issue, the woman with two kids behind me even raised an eyebrow as he seemed to have snapped over me at her, asking if shes done now.<//Text>< gmap_id>

The store is very easy to see from the road. It also looks very classic so it's good for pictures during road trips. I found that you can cash checks here as well. The customer service is really great too they were welcoming and nice.</text>

BEWARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS OVER PRICED STORE, THEY SHYSTERS CROOKED OF THE WORSE KIND.THEY CHARGE YOU FOR THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE ON THE COUNTER THEN TRY TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU ARE WRONG, OVER CHARGING CREDIT CARDS AND DEBIT AND THEN TRY CONFUSE YOU .THEY ARE RUDE AND ASS HOLES ... THEY WILL EVEN CALL YOU A LIER VERY TRASEY PEOPLE AND I AM REPORTING THEM TO WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ALSO THE BUREL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ....IF YOU WANT A GOOD STORE TO GO TO DRIVE TO THE NUEVO MARKET YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR....<//review>

<text>There's a taco shop inside, not sure if it's also owned by the same place. Tacos were okay, but they used nacho cheese from a bag for carne asada fries.< /text><GmapID>0x80db5e51c685875d:0xf2f6b64a2ea0be0b<//GmapID><userid>114815598880010505049</userid></record></dataset><record>

The cashier seems like he hates his job, very rude. Over charges you to use your card he says they only charge .75 cents but I was charged $2.40 more then the original price he told me?! THIS PLACE IS ROBBING PEOPLE. Check you receipt  and make sure the prices before you hand him your card.</review>

Very satisfied with the Miller Funeral Home services. The staff are respectful and helpful. Genuinely nice people who are there to help you during one of the most stressful times. They clearly explain the services they offer and what you are paying for. No hidden costs. Everything is very organized, the facility clean, beautiful, and peaceful. Highly recommend.< /Text>

<UserId.>107103056262834771798</UserId.><text>David, Elizabeth, and staff,

Having someone dear to you die isn’t an experience that you plan for. With that said I can’t express enough how thankful my family was for Miller Funeral Home.
The moment my mother died, David took care of everything quickly, quietly, and with loving hands.  David and Elizabeth were both helpful, sensitive, and directed us in the right direction for all the arrangements that needed to be made.
My family wants to thank you, it was a very hard time for us, and you helped in ways that made it easier to cope.
I would also like to say how much we appreciated the follow up call - months later, checking on me and my family. .
David,  you and your staff, used such professionalism, kindnesses, and thoughtfulness that helped us get through such a devastating time.
Thank you so much,
Terri Boddy< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>They were very helpful, kind and understanding through our grief and made the process easy for us and easy to understand. They checked in on us and answered any questions we had, they even helped us on a day we didnt know they were closed on. My first experience with a funeral home and I will be coming back to them, if I lose anyone other loved ones. I recommend them for your funeral needs.< /text>< Rate>

About a week ago, I received a message from Elizabeth at Miller Funeral Home asking how my family and I were doing after my father passed back in April. Here’s my reply to Elizabeth and again, thank you all so much.

Thank you so much Elizabeth, you’re very kind to ask. I'm sure you hear this from others, we have our good and bad days. I know my dad has peace now, and the folks at Miller were there to take care of all the necessary tasks required. Your professionalism is beyond exceptional. We can't thank you enough!
Sincerely,
Bobbi Akers and family< /text>

I used Miller Funeral home after my mother passed. Joshua met with me at funeral home and walked me through the process of services for both of my parents at the National Veterans Cemetery in Dixon. He was very patient and accommodating when I asked for several changes regarding dates. Joshua made the whole process very smooth and I would highly recommend Miller Funeral home.< /Text>

When my friend passed away his request was to be sent to Millers in Folsom.
When I went to Millers  I was met with kindness and consideration. They were very helpful and explained all the options available. They never rushed me to make a decision.
Josh was so very helpful. My friend was a veteran and wanted to be buried at the Veterans Cemetery near Dixon CA.
Millers  took care of all the arrangements.
I ran into a minor problem at the cemetery. Millers  took over and resolved it quickly.
I would highly recommend Millers .
Thank you for all you did for me.

They even got the death certificates in a timely manner and have been willing to help out with anything I needed. The video of the funeral turned out really good.

Miller Funeral Home has been the greatest blessing to our family in such a difficult time. Our fathers passing was a very unexpected and traumatic one. I had never planned a funeral and did not know where to begin. I called and immediately was comforted by Ester don’t worry about anything we take care of everything! Let me tell you they do! From start to finish, where dad goes, how the planning goes, making an appointment at the cemetery. This funeral home service is outstanding! They are family owned and I do feel like family to them with how they took care of my fathers services and recently unfortunately but my grandfathers services. The service men are all extremely professional and very kind. They know what you may be feeling and make sure you feel the least stress possible. Definitely highly recommended from me.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I truly cannot recommend the staff at Miller's Funeral Home highly enough.  I called them with a bit of an odd request regarding the division of my parents' ashes in order for each of their children to have a portion of them and the individuals I spoke to were so kind and comforting, they were able to accommodate our odd request (my father passed away over a decade ago, which was problematic for other facilities I had contacted since they didn't process the remains) in a professional and efficient manner.  Their space is tranquil and beautiful and as much as I hate to think about it, should I never need such services in the future they will absolutely be my first call.< /Text>< Pics>

Everyone involved helped myself and my family get through this time of unexpected sorrow.  They were caring, professional, very helpful and very organized.  They were able to live stream the service for the people who could not come due to the covid19 pandemic or other reasons.  That was a great addition to this.  My family cannot thank them enough.  Vic, our funeral director, did an excellent job.< /Text>

From my very first call, done in shock and disbelief over the sudden death of my brother in law, they conducted themselves with kindness, patience and professionalism. They made arrangements to meet and go over the process and answered all of our questions. We felt zero pressure to make any choices we were not comfortable with. Very soothing environment and caring staff. Very responsive to requests and stayed in touch throughout the entire week, and went out of their way to handle additional tasks and requests. They supplied us with information to all the other vendors we needed for the funeral, saving us so much stress and time. Everything was handled elegantly and smoothly. Vic did a beautiful job allowing us to have an open casket for final goodbyes. We are so thankful to Miller Funeral Home. They understand their business thoroughly and the gravity and pain involved for the family members, and do their absolute best to help alleviate some of the suffering. God bless their work.<//review>< pictures>

< review>
When my wife passed, we had only discussed a few details that were important to her, but there were so many more things that needed to happen.

I had received a number of referrals to work with Miller and Lakeside Cemetery - but the most powerful recommendations came from our pastor who told us of his experiences with the Miller team over the years and also from the decedent affairs desk at Kaiser who told me that Miller was one of the finest funeral teams he works with ... period.

I’m so happy that I entrusted my wife to the team at Miller. Everyone was so easy to work with, so gracious, and so caring. At so many points along the way both during the planning of my wife’s funeral and burial to now ... months later, I continue to receive texts or emails from different people within their family asking how the kids and I are doing. Working with people that do what they do with love and compassion matters to me ... I couldn’t say enough wonderful things about Josh, Tim, and everyone at the Miller/Lakeside organization.< /review>

Joshua was incredibly compassionate and accomodating  for my needs for my husband's funeral calling hours June 15, 2020. The process was completed with ease and the staff met every need we had. My husband passed very suddenly and unexpectedly.  During the pandemic time with restrictions, Josh and the Miller staff were able to hold the calling hours for 3 hours and allow for all those who wanted to pay respects to my husband and our family to come to the home. I have ordered memorial keepsake jewelry through them which was also affordable  and delivered to me in a timely fashion. I would highly recommend this professional establishment and the staff. They have also made several follow up calls to inquire as to how I have been handling my grief. This has been such a kind gesture and genuine on their part. Miller Funeral home will meet all the needs of the family who have lost a loved one.</review>

Miller Funeral Home first helped us when my mom died in 1995.  We had to ship her out of state for the funeral & burial, but we bought the casket from them and they did the embalming.  They took care of the extra paperwork, made arrangements with the funeral home in Chicago, and made sure we knew what the process was.  Everything was done with kindness and compassion, no stress, no mistakes and they did a beautiful job.  And they didn't try to steer us to the most expensive products, whatever we wanted was fine with them.  So when my mother-in-law died last month, we had already told hospice to contact them.  Irvin picked her up.  He gave us as much time with her as we needed, making sure we didn't feel rushed.  He handled her body with great gentleness and care, as if he loved her as much as my wife and I did.  At the funeral home, Josh helped us with all the paperwork in a kind and loving way and made sure we got the exact urn we wanted.  He returned all my wife's calls promply.  Because of Covid, and because there was no other family here, we didn't have a service at the funeral home.  My wife made a video of a celebration of her life and Josh figured out a way to post it along with her obituary on their website so that family and friends in the rest of the U.S. and Canada could view it.  Mom wanted to be cremated, and it was very comforting to know that they have their own facility for that because we knew we could put our trust in them.  They continue to call and check in on my wife to find out how she is and if they can be of anymore help.  They are the best.<//Review>

A truly caring family business. I was out of state when my mom suddenly passed away, and there was no one near her from the family to take care of her body. She had nothing planned for her funeral or burial, so we had to figure out everything quick and on the spot. I called Irving and asked him if they could pick up her body and to store it in their funeral home until me and my siblings can make it back to California and decide how to proceed next morning. The way he treated my mom’s body as if of his own dear relative. He said, “We will take care of your mom, don’t worry about anything.” It gave me so much peace, and I instantly knew that we are in good hands. They guided us through the whole process of funeral and burial, worked with our budget and even helped us to find a burial place that would be less expensive than theirs (since my mom didn’t have any money saved or anything arranged for her possible passing). I’m very grateful for their family business because during this difficult time they acted as if they were my family with every small detail and advice and even helping us clean the picture for the memorial service. May God bless them for their heart of servanthood and support during such difficult circumstances. I’d give them all 10 stars if I could because I haven’t experienced such high level of service in a long time.<//review>

<Review>Irvin and his team are so amazing! My grandma passed away and they made the process so smooth during the difficult time. They made excellent suggestions for the vendors that helped me take care of flowers and other arrangements. They took care of everything and made my family feel at ease. They even reached out to me through txt msging to ask me how I’m doing. So impressed! Best services in town!</Review>< pictures>

When you lose someone close, your mind doesn’t think straight, you’re still in a shock, they covered everything a family can need when struck with such a tragedy. Thank you!< /Text>< pics>

<review>This is a family owned business and they treat their customers like family.  Everyone was really caring, courteous and accommodating, and also extremely knowledgeable, professional, honest, and unbelievably patient. This was hugely important to us as we faced very sudden and tragic death in the family. Meeting with us multiple times, both scheduled and completely ad-hoc, they helped us to make important decisions, provided helpful information on all available options, tirelessly guided us through the process, and took care of every detail.  Wendy even came to meet us at the cemetery (Lakeside Memorial Lawn) on her day off after we called her and asked to show us available plots one more time.  Larry who agreed to officiate at the service, spent endless number of hours talking to members of the family and preparing a beautiful and touching eulogy.  I do not know anything more that they could have done for us.  From the moment we first talked to Vic and David on the phone and through-out the process we knew that we were in very capable hands, and felt relieved that we made the right choice and that everything would be done well.  We also never felt rushed or pressed to buy any particular service or product.  On the contrary, many additional services were offered by the Miller Funeral home at no charge, and their prices in general were very reasonable.  The memorial service in a lovely chapel and graveside service were simply beautiful.  The service included eulogy, photo slide show accompanied by music, and time for family and friends to share memories.  There is also space for reception adjacent to the chapel. The service in the chapel was livestreamed via YouTube for those who could not attend in person due to Covid.  In addition, Miller Funeral home posts obituaries on their website, which include a tribute wall for sharing memories, planting a tree in memory of the loved one, or sending flowers to the family.
We are very grateful to the Miller Funeral home team for helping us through difficult times and providing outstanding service.  Thank you!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Miller’s was a professional and accommodating refuge during a difficult time for our family. We have dealt with mortuaries before and found them difficult and sometimes shady, but Tim was straightforward and compassionate, and completely went the extra mile both in the service and the costs. Irvin and Dave were very helpful, and the chapel was beautiful. They made an excellent video recording of the memorial service in which Tim spoke eloquently and gently. It is a family run business and noticeably non-corporate in its feel. Thanks so much guys!<//review><pics>None</pics>< user>

Everyone we worked with showed such compassion and empathy.  There was no request that they did not meet, in fact they exceeded our requests.

Miller Funeral Home handled EVERYTHING for us with complete efficiency and most importantly with true care and concern.

<Text>I have used Miller's Funeral Home for my father 1st and then recently for my mother.  They are truly a top notch professional and kind organization to work with.  My representative this time was Josh Schaubroeck.

Josh was very easy to work with in such stressful situation and he made it very easy for me to flow through the process, by pointing me in the right direction and always assuring me the service would be beautiful and it certainly was.  I felt Josh went above and beyond in allowing me and my family to do the service a little different and exactly the way we wanted it.

The facility is very calming and is beautiful inside . I highly recommend Miller Funeral Home.</Text><Response>None</Response>< Date>

<text>Although I don't have much experience with many funeral homes as I have been lucky to not have many loved ones pass, I have a tremendous amount of experience with customer service and professionalism. When my mother passed away recently, we called Miller Funeral Home in Folsom, CA, and they were very warm, professional, and communicative. During our initial funeral planning, they kept us on track and organized with all of the overwhelming planning, and gave us wonderful resources for flower arrangements, catering, and memorial venues. We were honored to have such amazing service and guidance during this difficult time. Thank you for your tremendous help Semenyuk FAMILY!<//text>< Pics>

At this difficult times we are going true with COVID-19. Miller funeral home managed that my family could say goodbye to my father  in the best way and that those who could not attend were able to see the service from home.
One of my brothers was not allowed to cross the border because of COVID-19 and be here but he was able to be present thanks to Miller Funeral Home staff.</text>

Miller Funeral Home from first contact, has gone above and beyond handling every detail of my mother's funeral.

I live out of the area and planned the whole funeral over the phone with Irvin. I found him to be respectfully pleasant, caring, and very attentive, he has always promptly returned my calls, and trust me I called a lot!

The funeral  had to be, all inclusive, upon the request of my mother's administrator, which in addition to the funeral, included the clergy, flowers, and the musician to play Taps at the funeral, and Irvin handled all of these items for me.
(I did order the flowers of my choice from a nearby florist and they submitted the invoice for him to include in the final contract.)

The funeral was very quaint and beautiful, I couldn't have wished for a better place to have my mother's final farewell to take place.

In closing, I had talked to several other funeral homes, and I did not choose them because I felt like they were too commercialized and just cared about the money. This is not so from the first moment of contact and throughout the process with Miller Funeral Home.

Thank you very much to everyone at Miller Funeral Home, for helping me through such an emotional time, you are very much appreciated.<//Review>

I know the family and employees that run this funeral home. There is no one better than these guys that I would ever want to bring my business to in times of grief and tragedy.

On top of the great, top-notch service they provide in everything they do, they are extremely compassionate and will always put the grieving family first. They take off all the burdens from you and handle everything professionally. They are hard-working, ethical and really strive to serve the people of the communities.

Sure, a funeral home is not somewhere anyone wants to end up in, but it is life and if I had to chose one, it would certainly be Miller Funeral Home.< /review>

Irving promised to get back to me regarding my mother's and grandma's headstone months ago. We've called and left many messages. It's been going on 5 months. The men at Miller Funeral Home never called. As we're writing this Irving called us back after many months of not, and we live out of state. He said he never called us because of transitions in their workforce. We told him this was no excuse. Expect below average service if you want to use this place.<//Text>

Aundrey and his staff were geniuinly amazing and caring. It was so easy and we felt so blessed to have them take care of every detail from start to finish. From the embalming to the viewings to the burial and even headstone. They had all the resources and best i can say at that!!!!! They were friendly and available everytime i called them and quick to respond in every situation. I am extremly happy for all their help. In times like this everything is very emotional and extremly hard to cope with but they made it so easy that honestly it felt we dis nothing other than sign aome papwrwork!!! Miller funeral home is the place to use!!!! Thanks again from the bottom of the Orellana familys hearts! God bless u all.<//Review>

<review>I was helped by Juan Carlos. He went above & beyond for me!
I had to get lights for my car and he said he could just look at them and tell which ones I would need in bright daylight, they were the fancy Halogen.
I had been told by a competitor that they were the other ones, which would of completely been wrong for my car!
These guys are cool!
Thank you for the help!!! 🙆‍♀️< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I came here to buy chains and I am literally clueless about cars. Anthony U was extremely helpful, went outside and checked my tire size for me, and got me a great deal. He was very informative and patient with my car dumbness. I was anxious about figuring this purchase out but Anthony made it very easy and enjoyable. Great store, will return if I need anything else.<//Review>

The worst customer service ever. They know very little about cars and have no desire to serve you like is advertised on TV. The store is full of young people with no desire to do their job.<//Review>

I have been to this location a few times and received kind, effective service each time. The last time I was there Osvaldo was closing up, but he still helped me figure out why my brake light was not working. We looked at the bulb, fuse, and cords and fixed the problem. I am not saying that he will always be able to go outside of his duties, but I liked that he wanted to help.</Text>

Anthony rocks!!! I came in to NOHO Auto Zone practically in tear because the rear camera on my new Ranger didn’t alert me that there was a wood pole. Anthony assured me a bidding would make everything AOK. Headed home to do it now - recommended Turtle Wax Rubbing Compound.

Thank you Anthony for awesome service, being incredibly kind and reassuring me I don’t have to take it to someone but can DO IT MYSELF! I wanted to share photos but unfortunately this lame system isn’t as good as Yelp’s and doesn’t provide a way to do so.

Self empowerment is an extra bonus at my new Auto Zone store!</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Jerrold C. was so incredibly helpful today. Right when I walked in the door he greeted me with a smile and asked how he could help me? He was kind enough to come check the rear brake light on my car so I would know which bulb needed to be replaced. He found the bulb in the store, helped me purchase it, and then installed the new bulb for me.

I am so enthused with the customer service he provided!! I'll be going back to this store the next time I need to replace a car part for sure.< /review>< Pics>

July was so helpful the minute I walked into the store. He acknowledged that I walked through the door and told me to ask him if I had any questions, which I did. I needed a new battery and he helped me with honesty on what would be the best for my car. Not only that, he installed my battery in just minutes and was so nice. Thank you, July! I’ll be back next time I need anything and will be asking specifically for you!<//review>

<Text>A real handy resource for quick automotive needs. They've got all the basics for those quick fixes and fluid needs... This particular store has been fairly mellow, orderly and the staff helpful whenever I've been in. Usually it's not a hassle to park and I've occasionally seen the staff outside helping customers diagnose something. I know they stick engine parts behind the counter - though I haven't had a need for those in a while.< /Text>< date>

Decently knowledgeable staff. Got sold vacuum line when I requested fuel... luckily I caught it at home, could have been a disaster for the motorcycle. Lot looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in a year this caused me to go across the street to PB instead<//text>

This location is by far one of the most unpleasant locations that I've ever been in. The only reason why I ever go into this particular AutoZone is to maintain my loyalty to Duralast Gold batteries. I have no stock in the company I just think that they work really well and the policy is very good should one fail. This changed for me however and I will be going to other AutoZone's to seek help from now on. I was under the assumption that I got two free replacement batteries with the purchase of a Duralast Gold. I found out that I was only eligible for one which I had already redeemed. This would have been perfectly fine with me if the associate hadn't been so incredibly short and impatient with me just because I couldn't understand her explanations. She talked very fast and very quietly and made it extremely difficult to understand her explanation of the replacement policy. The more I asked her to speak a little bit louder the more irritated she seemed get with me. I eventually rectified the situation with the battery but I can sure tell you that I won't be going to this location should something never happen again. How can you justify getting so irritated with a customer who's only trying to understand how something works so that they don't have this misunderstanding again? I would urge management to foster some better communication skills to practice in the workplace.< /text>

I bought brake pads here twice for mine and my wife’s car. Both times they sold me used brake pads without telling me they were used. Then when I put them on and drove around the block, the clip that holds one of the pads onto the caliber brakes clean off. When I try to replace it they tell me they need the whole set in order to replace them. When I ask them why they can’t exchange one? No explanation. What are you going to do with a broken brake pad and the rest of the set which is now incomplete? So I call the other autozone down the street and both times they are happy to help me and exchange the one that broke with a brand new pad that hasn’t been used.

<review>I guess my experience is unusual however I absolutely have to share it considering where it has left me and how much free time I'm going to have considering I can't move my vehicle pretty much at all. I limped my vehicle here from a street over after ordering a radiator at twice the price I could have gotten it somewhere else only because this was the closest auto store. I got it there with no water in the radiator whatsoever with only 2 bolts to pull it out and a few hoses that needed to be disconnected and was refused tool loan stating that they didn't want any water in the parking lot. Any water that was in it is now in the road and I am currently stranded and broke because I spent all my money on their over priced radiator that I only bought  since it was so close and their people won't let me use 2 tools to finish the job.< /review>< pictures>

On way to store straight after receiving ticket for no taillight. Which I was unaware of. Store would get super busy and then go to empty. Gave the "saint" per other reviews employee my info for replacement. I drive to friends home for assistance. I am told the bulb that was sold to me IS INCORRECT w/ computer assistance. Anymore info needed? Incompetent. Waste of time.  Thanks !<//Review>

< Review>
Went in to take an autozone battery and was talked down to like a kid by their thug manager. Hector C. I don't understand how they have rude sales manager. There's plenty qualified professionials wishing they had his position yet they allow this angry person to dictate his poor angry attitude. This is not the first time he's always mad at the world for one reason or another. Never helps out! -Loyal Customer for 10+ years!< /Review>

<Review>My Closest Honda Dealer quoted me $160 just to program my new key fob, and told me i would have to wait 1-2 hours for it to be done. The guys at Automotive key did it in 5 minutes and I paid $65 less then what the dealer quoted me. It was worth the drive from Fillmore, they saved me time and money. I highly recommend this place to everyone.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Do not go here!!! My father took his car here for a new key fob and they fried his car’s computer. The owner is refusing to take responsibility and pay for the damages. Our car had to be towed from the parking lot and it’s been months now fighting with insurances. Stay away!!! These damages are going to cost close to 6 thousand dollars. The owner is a crook. You have been warned.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80c2888c9cc84039:0x7bb49c6e4d836b0<//gmapID>< user_id>

When your father came to pick up the car we had everything ready to go and just needed to have a mechanic do the needed repairs.\n\nHe left with his car and without any record and refused to take the repairs we offered saying that his insurance would cover it. After we spoke to your insurance they shared our sentiment that it is no longer in our responsibility.\n\nYour frustration is misplaced.

<review>Having lost the only keys i have the night before, i was frantic on what to do. Saw their company and next thing you know they were at my house in 20min!! He was really professional and tried his hardest to get in my car but its impossible. Still, he was able to do it somehow and got new keys in an hour. Probably wouldve taken less if it wasnt for the weird way my car is set up. THANK YOU!< /review><time>1598390436643<//time>< user_name>

Very fast and efficient ! Two new keys in under 30 min for a very competitive price. If you’re reading this review stop looking elsewhere and just go here. You won’t be disappointed. Work done on the spot while you wait.<//review>

My wife lost our one and only fob for our Toyota Prius.  I researched other locksmiths in the area as well as the dealership and found Automotive Key.  The serviceman was prompt in replying to my phone call and made a service call within an hour.  He reprogrammed my car in less than an hour and although it's still painful to lose my fob, I feel a tad better that this establishment was practically half as much as the other quotes.< /text>

Recently purchased a Ford F-150, only given one key/Fob for the truck. Dealer made no attempt to get me another key.  Later I inquired and they wanted 460$. WHAT, outrageous.  I was introduced to Automotive Key, by Francisco at LinenX SCV.    I can’t say enough about the Service Luis from Automotive Key provided to rectify this “one key issue”.

In less then 10 minutes Luis cut me a new ignition key, programmed the Fob completely and also provided me with the factory code numbers to use on the entry keypad outside the drivers door, Something AutoNation SCV wanted an additional 65$ to provide. And I bought the truck from them.   Luis saved the day, and me about 300$.. Give him a call, he’s expert, all service, and totally honest businessman.<//review>

Best place ever! They saved me over $80 for a new key for my Jeep Commander then they handed me TWO keys when I thought it was a great price for just one. These guys are great I'd highly recommend them.</text>

I needed a spare Smart Key for my Toyota Prius, and was referred to Automotive Key by a non-automotive locksmith.  The owner responded promptly and quoted me a terrific price.  I was able to schedule a convenient house call, simply texting the details, and Luis arrived on time, providing friendly, efficient service.  The new key fob works great.  My only issue was not knowing there's a surcharge for credit card payments (to help offset Visa's processing fees).  Thankfully, because I hadn't been told that beforehand, Luis reduced the cost of the service.  Highly recommended!< /text>

<Review>Extremely professional, honest and fast: probably could've cheated me but in a few minutes said the key just needed to be reprogrammed and charged me nothing.  I would've waited much more time in the Ford service lane and then longer waiting for a diagnosis and longer waiting for a resolution.  So many many thanks!<//Review>< Pictures>

Luis was very professional! From phone-call to key replacement!He was here in his estimated time and had me ready to go in 5minutes. You will save money by using Automotive Key instead of going to a dealership.< /Text>

<Text>Chris was our tech, arrived on time and was very straightforward and professional. Took care of the problem, explained it and the charge was very reasonable. This was truly “old fashioned family owned business” service at it’s finest!!
I wish more people would go back to this business model, it’s an excellent one...< /Text>< Pics>

Our AC starting blowing hot air on a 115 degree day here in the desert. Thankfully, I was familiar with Esser AC as we purchased our central air unit from them about seven years ago. I sent a text in the early morning and heard back from them by 7:30 am. The technician, Marco, kept me informed about his arrival time and quickly serviced and repaired the AC. The house cooled off rapidly
and the fee was very reasonable. I highly recommend Esser AC for the purchase and installation of an AC system as well as for service and repairs.<//Text>

Chris came out and quickly diagnosed the problem, fixed the leaky ducts, replaced my air filter, and showed me how to open the furnace doors to replace filters in the future (not an easy task). He was knowledgeable, helpful, and answered all my questions. I highly recommend this company and their technician, Chris!< /Text>

<user_name>Marie Gill</user_name><review>On Saturday evening I noticed that my ac unit wasn't cooling down my house. Went outside and saw the fan blades weren't moving. Called around to different companies and came across Esser. They answered and told me that they would be able to come out Sunday morning at 9am. All the other places I had called were either closed or wouldn't be able to set up an appointment until Monday. Sunday morning a tech from Esser came out. He was very friendly and knew exactly what the problem could be, it was a compressor that he was able to fix. I was very happy with the overall experience with this company. I'll be sure to use them and recommend them to friends and family. Thank you so much!!!<//review><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

AC stopped working late at night. Called in around 815 and was given an appointment time around 12-5pm. Ruben the tech called around 1215 stating would be here in ten minutes! Very prompt! Came and fixed my problem within 1 hr and everything was back to working condition! I’m able to not sweat on in my own house in this triple digit heat! Appreciate the work and professionalism ESSERS! That Michael Esser fella is running things smoothly down at headquarters! Again appreciate the work! Thanks again<//review>

Good attention over the phone. A waste of money paying for the monthly plan (we own 2 condos). Second condo required service. Pay technician service and then a few days after that visit there were dark flakes coming through; a second "service" was dispatched for something that first technician could have clarified about the service. Second technician just said "not related with fist service requested" and charged again. I canceled my account I will better look for another service company.<//review>

<review>From start to finish it was a pleasure to work with Esser Airconditioning  and Heating.  Prior to the actual appointment I was sent text message reminders (I need all the help I  can get in remembering 😄) and on the day of the appointment I was once again reminded of the appointment, given the name of the technician ,his estimated time of arrival and a picture of our technician, Scott.

Scott was a professional  from the get go. Upon arrival he stated who he was and confirmed the purpose of the visit.  As a new owner  he explained the system to us and at the conclusion of the visit he explained the benefits of purchasing a maintenance agreement . There was no hard sell and we are now very happy about our ongoing relationship with Esser.<//review>< Response>

We had a major power failure at our condo (thanks to SCE)! It was a power surge that took out our Refrigerator and our Air Conditioner. It was over 90° inside and we were desperate for some professional help. We called Esser and in a short time, Chris Englund showed up an identified a blown fuse and a destroyed Thermostat. He replaced and reprogrammed the thermostat and we were up and running. All of this took an hour and a half (at 10:00pm)!
No price gouging even though we would have paid anything to get cooled down.
Thank you Chris and Esser. You’re the best!< /Text>

Was told to replace my older heater after an energy efficiency co. Allegedly fried my gas valve. i was told by Esser that the valve I needed was obsolete and unibtainable.
Turned out the energy co was able to fix my heater via proper wiring not replacing valve. Turns out a valve for my unit was available if we actually needed to repkace valve. So.. I can only surmise that the main goal for this co is replacement and not repair.nice people tho.. punctual and easy to communicate with.. always get a second opinion tho</review>

<Text>My A/C decided to die in the summer in the desert. We were miserable.  The first company I called told me I had to wait 5 days for an appointment, even though they advertise 24/7 service.  Esser told me they'd have someone at my house within the hour.  The technician  was knowledgable and friendly, and the poor fellow braved the heat for several hours to fix the problem with no complaints. He also managed to fix the problem by replacing a component, as opposed to the entire part, which saved us a good chunk of money. Highly recommend them. I will definitely use them again in the future if I need help.<//Text>< Response>

Esser initially came out to inspect my AC. The repairman was super friendly and very professional. Unfortunately he had to deliver the bad new. My AC unit need to be replaced. Esser gave me a quote which seemed reasonable to replace a full unit, but they were only providing a 1 year warranty. When I questioned that, Esser informed me that they were not replacing the entire unite (which was stated in their quote) but only replacing a part. I am smart enough to identify a bait and switch, so called Desert Air and replaced the entire AC unit for a Carrier brand with a 10 year warranty for $150 less than Esser’s quote.<//Text>

{'time': 1573449762354, 'text': "Hello Mr Stone,\nThank you for the chance you gave us to diagnose and estimate your repair. I have to personally apologize for the shortcoming regarding your expectations of your experience. All compressor and equipment replacement quotes are ran through me when the service manager isn't available. As I was traveling for work during the time of your estimate, I failed to catch a mistake in the verbiage of your email correspondence with office staff.  The price originally quoted to you was indeed for a replacement condenser, not just the compressor. Hence why there was a $150 difference in cost. As a result of your comment, we are entertaining the idea a more streamlined approach to your type of situation. That being said, we did not meet your expectations and rightfully so. However, if there is anything I can do for you to regain your trust or gain a little more insight, please feel free to reach out and ask for me directly.\n-Mike Esser"}<//response>

For years I have used this company for care, maintenance, and new equipment for A/C and Heating of my residence. My review not only commends the company. I give an outstanding recommendation for Scott, whom I have requested for a number of years. He is thorough in his visits. (I subscribe to the contractual system of 2 times/year.) His standards of inspection are impeccable. I know -- mentioning his name, and encouraging homeowners to request him to serve, might cause a slight change to my scheduling. But, I cannot avoid suggesting him as a member of the great technicians in Esser Air Conditioning And Heating.< /text>

<Text>We suddenly experienced a lack of heating during a very cool period of weather in Palm Desert due to the furnace not working.  I called Esser as they are dealers for Trane and we could not be more pleased. Ruben came in the afternoon, checked and explained everything and fixed it right away.  Reasonable cost as well.  This is super service. Thank you very much</Text><user_id>111747327126948443598< /user_id><gmapID>0x80db0328e62f9c67:0x623e9f6322241ef< /gmapID><name>Joyce Papirnik</name>< Time>

Our ac stopped working in the evening of a 112 degree day. I called Esser at 7 am and Lester was here at 9:30 and was very polite and friendly and respectful of our house. He diagnosed the problem quickly, returned to the shop to get a replacement part. He installed it and waited to insure system was cooling properly which it was. Thank you Esser and Lester!<//Text>

After a power surge knocked out my a/c unit Chris came out quickly and was able to find the problem and order the part needed. When the parts came in he was just as quick in repairing the unit and make sure all was working well before he left. This was not the first time I’ve had Chris come to my home. He is always very polite and courteous.<//review>

<Review>Called Esser for a service and ended up purchasing a new system due to the cost of the repair. They were fair with us from the very start. I've known this day was coming, I was just hoping it wouldn't be this summer!  Either way, their workers were polite, clean and very knowledgeable. Like i said, the experience was overall very good. Thank you for squeezing us in last minute!< /Review>< resp>

Esser installed a new AC and Furnace about two years ago and now services it plus an old unit every spring and fall. Just had the spring service by technician Lester. As always great! Very thorough and discussed with us what the future holds for the old unit in 2020 when freon goes away. I recommend Esser highly.</text>

Wes needed to troubleshoot the thermostat because the heater was not responding.  He first checked the thermostat then the unit in the attic. The attic unit was working ok so he then focused on the thermostat and found a loose wire.  That fixed the problem.  Wes is well trained and diagnosed the problem correctly.  He didn't leave until the heater was working.  Excellent service.<//text>

We have been using Esser for over 10 years to do service checks on an old compressor and the technicians sent out are always very honest and to the point. The checks were always completed in a timely matter and they never gave a sales pitch to try to sell a new unit as this was over 17 years old. This unit finally quit and I had them come out. The tech tried and tested everything down to the circuit breaker to see if he could get it working just on the service call price. Turns out it was indeed shot so I had them evaluate our home and recommend a new Trane unit. Just before install, I came down as live far away due to my mother going into the hospital with an emergency situation.  The Esser team was fantastic in every way accommodating me having to due this while being at the hospital. David and install crew were amazing and we now have a great new whole system which cools the home at great ease compared to the old system. Always a conscientious company which I know from past with ownership and will continue to only trust them with our HVAC needs. Thanks for making what I thought would be a logistical nightmare a snap. They even had to hire a crane last minute to lift the compressor over the back patio walls. All was done in less time than originally told. Refreshing to still see a well run and honest outfit in business these days!< /Review>

We called Esser because they were highly rated on Google. Unfortunately, the experience was a series of failures.

We are new residents in the area and had not called this company before. Our AC was not working and when I called the person who handled the call was very friendly but failed to ask us what kind of system we had. That was their first failure.

We waited until the following afternoon for our appointment.

The next afternoon, the tech arrived just after 5 and was at our place for a couple of hours. He basically, took the panel off the unit and then spent the rest of the time on the phone asking for help from others. He asked us where our air handlers were and when I told him they were in the attic, he told us he was too fat to crawl up there and that "a skinnier guy will have to come out tomorrow." He left without even diagnosing the problem. So, the second failure was sending us an unqualified and apparently out of shape technician.

The next day, I called dispatch at 8:30 in the morning. They had no idea who we were. They eventually found notes on our previous day's call and said that they would be out ASAP. By 1:30, we hadn't heard anything so I called to check on the status and was told that the tech was still on the way. At 3:45, I received a call from dispatch telling me that no one would be coming and that they did not think they could fix our system after all. This call came from their regular dispatch center not someone in management.

So, their third failure was wasting our time for a day and then calling late to say they would not be coming.

Their fourth and final failure was making the poor person in dispatch call and tell us they weren't coming. I would have expected management to take responsibility and make that call themselves.

Top to bottom, our experience with Esser was a complete failure. If you are going to call them, be sure to be specific about the type of equipment you have and be prepared to be patient!

As a post-script, we called another company who sells our particular type of AC unit. They sent a tech out the next day who went up in the attic, reset a switch and had us running in less than 15 minutes.< /Review>

We did the research and they were highly recommended so we thought we'd give them a try.  Had them do the yearly maintenance on our system end of May which was installed by another company in 2009.  A month later the motor went out on the compressor which they replaced.  I don't have a problem with that since it's normal wear and tear.  This is a vacation home so we're not here all the time.  Next trip down end of August I checked the filter and noticed the A/C closet was the coolest room in the house.  Found air leaking from an exposed hole next to the copper pipe.  The rubber gasket was also broken and cold air was rushing out.  I called Esser and told them this should have been caught and fixed during the maintenance visit.  They said they would come out to fix it but there would be a charge since it's past the 60 day warranty.  I fixed it with foil duct tape in just a few minutes.  To me, the proper customer service would have been to have somebody come by when in the area and tape it up.  They just lost us as a customer.<//text><username>Chris Longo<//username><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

{'time': 1605203743907, 'text': "Mr Corey,\n\nThank you for your honest feedback. I first want to apologize for any misunderstanding or lack of value you were provided. That being said, I looked into your file and noticed that the service was done in June of 2016. The technician noted that the panels had to be put on correctly, replaced the filter, added a couple lbs of refrigerant and replaced the schrader cores. Being that the service was over 4 years ago, I can't really go off anything other than the notes.\n\nUltimately, your satisfaction is still important to us, regardless of the service being 4 years ago. If there is anything I can do, please give me a call at 760-324-0550. I will be happy to address any concerns you still have.\n\n-Mike Esser"}< /Response>

I know about the  panel was off since last year, I was in the attic last week before I hurt my back. Then I get asked to get the air conditioner freon checked,  I left to go to urgent care about my back, to come back home to see a charge of The over price job. Of $258.00.

Our A/C went out during a 4 day holiday weekend with 110 degree heat.. The problem involved a very sophisticated, not readily available motor. Esser was able to locate one for us and made a second trip at the very end of the work day to install it. They are a reliable and dependable service company and the only Trane dealer in the Coachella Valley.< /text>

They installed a variable speed TRANE in my home. The system has worked great for over a year. They zoned my bedrooms and common areas. My energy bill is under 150$ a month for a 2000ft2 home. I am extremely pleased. Their followup since then has been impressive. I dont look forward to ever replacing my AC system again, but I do like the fact that I have this AC company to help me out.< /Review>

<Date>1530063286059<//Date><rating>3< /rating><text>This is a good 3 star rating.  They got the job done.  That said, I was not as fortunate as many of their other customers.  Initial appointment for second opinion of A/C problem scheduled mid-late on a Friday.  Estimate was accurate, and required minimal repair compared to other bids. Looked good. Agreed, due to bid and reputation.  Repair required a new coil condensor pan from manufacturer in Texas.  Part got to their system late Friday, while open.  Part shipped on Tuesday, and arrived the following Friday, late, in time to repair.  Esser's people did a reasonable job keeping me posted, as area temps exceeded 105 to 110. Lester arrived and dismantled the coil, to find that the manufacturer sent the wrong part.  Missed late Friday timing to correct order until Monday.  Honestly, I was livid.  I knew the earliest possible repair would be Tuesday.  I really didn't care who screwed up the order, and still don't.  As temps soared to 110-115 afternoons, we had a few very difficult days.  Monday morning I called them to find progress.  Communication was wishy-washy as to expected arrival day, though "expedited". I was as demanding as possible to find out what expedited meant in terms of expected date. To me, someone should make sure expedited meant "overnight" for Tuesday install.  They said the manufacturer did not provide a tracking code, even with repeated requests to them.  But, late Tues morning I received an appointment notice for early afternoon.  Lester arrived, and installed the new pan, and got everything working.  Thank you.  My 3 star review is a "1" for getting the wrong part, and a "5" for responding and correcting it at the earliest possible time.  Starting to cool off.  But it was an ordeal.</text>< pictures>

Had a new Trane system installed and Chris E. Was the person that followed up to make sure all was right with installation and if anything else needed to be done. He did an excellent job and our new Trane system is awesome. Thank you to MattG. For recommendations and Micheal Esser for taking the time to show me a system before I decided to purchase. Thank you again Team Esser.</Review>

When he was here I asked him to check the evaporative cooler as well. He checked the belt and oiled a bearing on the cooler and told me that the evaporative cooler was in good condition. He then presented me with a bill for $176 - $88 for the initial service charge and an additional $88 for he five minutes he spent on the cooler. He also informed me that the compressor was bad in the AC unit and a new one would be $3000 or I could replace the whole unit for $6000. I called another service company and they quoted $1600 for a new compressor or $2500 for a new unit with a five year warranty. They also informed me that the pads on the cooler were in very bad shape and replacing them would greatly increase the cooling. Additionally, the second company charged no service charge since I am having them do the work.
I will never do business with Esser and i suggest that anyone needing service do some price comparisons.</Text>< Pics>

I was driving by and seen this place, I stopped to look inside and to my surprise it's literally a hidden gem here in my area. I love to try new foods and new places. This was a clean place to start, very open concept. You have to order your food in the front ashes then they bring it to you. There prices are fair, there food is amazing. When you first get your order, you enjoy the presentation, the taste is amazing. Its great flavors, its unexplainable, its exquisite.🍴😃😄
There fries order with mixed chicken and meat. Its amazing. There lentil soup is very good. I also ordered there combo plate. Will recommend to anyone.<//text>

<Review>WHAT A HIDDEN GEM!! man. . this place is deceptively plain from the exterior. . do NOT be fooled, it is what is INSIDE that you desire. . the food was off the CHAIN!! .. hot, fresh, quick and delicious is the combo.. if you are in the area, looking for a wide selection of bomb, well priced meals I sugfest you check out "The Edge"..<//Review>< name>

The plates are a great amount and everything on the plate was tasty! What I didn't expect but enjoyed was pickled beets and cabbage which added a nice acidity to the whole dish. And don't forget to ask for the garlic sauce cause it just made everything better! My family will definitely be back again! The service was so friendly and the environment was enjoyable nice and quiet. Just what I wanted to unwind on a Friday night with my family after a long work week.<//text>< Pics>

Good food, seriously worth it. However a bit awkward when workers are fighting... made dinner a bit uncomfortable.<//Review>

Today was the my first time eating there, it was nice, mostly quite. While this place need to improve the menu. I really wish to see more people enjoying their meal next time, because this place deserves it.</Text>

Really great food, the service was very friendly and accomodating. The fries I got were a little overly greasy but otherwise everything my family and I got we liked. It's not a super fancy place but they have booths and a tv.</text>

<text>I was going to give 4 starts because I really like this place and the EDGE Mediterranean has alot going for it, but... When I heard that they're bringing in a special bread oven for the flat bread it put them over the top! 5 stars! High scores for the hummus that is fresh and creamy. Carefully prepared chicken shawerma is so juicy and delicious the 2 for 5.50 sandwich deal almost feels like stealing. They follow the philosophy that: if you're going to do something do it the best.  That is evident the second you walk in the door with the mouth watering smell from the kitchen and the elegant decor throughout. There is definitely more than meets the eye when you're driving by so give it a try!< /text><rating>5</rating></record>

Ordered off doordash after 5 days in the mountains.  The 3 person feast has fed me for 4 days and I have enough for another day (plus extra rice). The ground meat kabobs were so well seasoned as was all the extras. Biggest drawback was the pits bread, seemed like store bought but I fried them for crisps and added seasonings. The middle east egg roll (beef) was so yummy. Great value for very good food.< /Review>

The only part of the order that was good was the baklava. We ordered the vegetarian plate with a salad. I could have made the same or better at home. Small amounts of dressing and hummus with the meal. This is definitely my least favorite Mediterranean food restaurant I've been to in San Diego.< /text>

This is my go-to middle eastern restaurant. If you want amazing hummus delicious yellow rice and chicken that is perfection then come here. Everyone who works here is always so helpful and kind. All of the portions are huge so look forward to leftovers that tastes just as great. And don't forget to order the lentil soup it is by far my favorite. I will drive all the way to Spring Valley just for this food.< /review>

With service, price and quality of ingredients I really love this place.  I will give an update upon my next to couple of visits.  By the way the staff was super helpful in helping pick my order.

<username>Rosa Torres< /username><userid>105213723311714197798< /userid><Text>I'm visiting Mediterranean restaurants in the area. What I can share anout this place is:
1 Place is clean.
2 Cafeteria feel to it.
3 Nice people
4 Food Portion size too small for what you  pay.
5 I had a greek salad with kobab chicken.
6 chicken really didn't have that Mediterranean sason (seasoning)  to it.
They gave me 4small chunks of chicken and the salad was on a think dinner plate.  As if I order half a salad.  Portion size was equivalent to small saled in other restuarants.
6 Would i come back? Yes I would just to try other thing on the menu.<//Text>< pictures>

This poor place is the right food in the wrong hood. If you were closer to Rancho you would constantly be packed. Once Chaldeans take over the entire East county, you will be sitting pretty and I will be as far away as possible, lol.<//review>

This is a simple Mediterranean (Chaldean) style restaurant. This is family owned and operated, so the mother or son may take your order and serve your food while dad makes the food in the back. They do have a few employees, so that's not always the case.

The food is homemade style. The lentil soup is wonderful. Chicken tikka is very tasty. And the filet mignon is off the charts. The salmon plate is also done just right. I do wish the pita bread was fresh baked. They do heat it up a bit, but if they had a tandoori or brick oven for that, this place would be amazing.</Review>

Had shawarma in pita bread- amazing! So flavorful, and soft. Wasn’t greasy and had just the right amount of fresh salad mix and tzatziki. Also had some baklava- oh gosh so sweet(the honey kind so you don’t feel guilty) . First time going and mannn I loved it. Not to mention it’s so clean and inviting inside. The cashier was very patient with my wandering daughter.  Loved the experience! Must try!</Review>

After having gone yesterday for my birthday lunch, the fam and I will definitely be repeat annihilators!!! Being a fan of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, I felt the need to give this newly-discovered resto a chance among those that I've given my promiscuous food palette a chance on such as Sahara, Valley Foods, Al Azayem, and North Park Produce.

While the restaurant's location isn't the most appealing (not to their own fault), I thought the owner's made up for it with their interior decor. If it had to be described, I'd say that it was neat, clean, and not too lavish or exotic in theme (which I'd say is a positive).

Their food menu was wall set near the register arranged in side-by-side framery of fairly high-quality, professional appearing culinary photos. The impression I got was that it was an order your food first then sit down type setting...and that we did!

My fam of five opted to go with the meal for three plate that fed our salivating mouths presented on a large silver platter filled with yellow rice (which layered the flat contour of the platter), two beef kebabs, two chicken kebabs, cuts of beef and chicken shawarma, and lastly an extra crispy, golden-brown chicken patty that identically resembled what the Japanese would call chicken katsu.

Now, let me tell you this- I am in no way exaggerating that I have a huge appetite and that portion-size is just as important to me as taste is to practically everyone on this planet aside from a contestant on I guess Naked and Afraid? (shrug). And boy did this place meet the challenge of my stomach's elasticity!!! I'd say it beat it, actually, because we had enough to take home and me to stuff myself with as a midnight snack!

And when we speak of the flavor/taste of the food? Ughhhhhmayzing (amazing)! Each meat item I fed my mouth with was bursting with flavor, no lie! I swear I could taste every fine spice that each food variety in the plate included. I could tell that behind the kitchen door was a cook who poured their love and joy of cooking into the meal that we had that afternoon. And their hummus and baba ganouge that was also served to us was phenomenal as we scooped each kind into neatly cut, fresh and warm from the oven pita bread.

As mentioned earlier, we're definitely coming back as this easily rivals the best I've ever had so far when it comes to Middle-Eastern cuisine (Sahara is my current top choice although I have many restaurants left to try).

Soooo....if you're in the mood for delicious, mouthwatering foodfare, you definitely have to hit this place up if you so happen to get lost in the Casa de Oro neighborhood of the Spring Valley area!

Make sure to give that thumbs up as if you were stranded in the Mojave Desert if you'd like more reviews! :)</Text>

Dining room is, nice sized, clean, well lit, and has food in refrigerated display. It was making my mouth water as I waited for my order. I ordered the filet mignon plate. With tax it is $14. Cashier was courteous. Took less than 10 min. Thanked me for coming in. My initial thought was its pricey. Food serving was perfect. They didn't skimp on the filet mignon either. Rice was delicious. The Mediterranean salad was small but blasting flavor and realized I didn't need more of it. Hummus was fresh & creamy. My dinner was worth the value. I will definitely be going back soon.

I was skeptical about the place at first due to it being located in Casa de Caca. Boy was I surprised when I got there. The previous reviews were dead on. Clean and nicely decorated. The kid behind the counter was a pleasant and courteous lad. Food was great. I will definitely go back.👍👍</text>

It's just okay. The food wasn't bad, but not a place to go sit down, more of a take-away place!< /Text>

<Review>Unorganized. They do not have a system in place for any online orders. They clear the line and then make the online orders as you come in and ask. Instead of incorporating it into the line as they come in. No greeting or person to deal with incoming online orders at all. Better off coming in and waiting in line since you will be last in line anyways.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>I'm a delivery driver for this place. They closed early on Sunday due to remodeling. Which is fine for me I completely understand but I still got orders for them and I needed to take a picture of their hours that they were closing and the lady completely refused to put the hours up instead she threw it away Knowing that all drivers are going to have to take a picture of this after I told her the first time.because I'm unable to take a picture I'm unable to get paid for the order and I have to just cancel it which gives me a cancel order which is bad for my rating.I'm a customer here too I love their sandwiches but I will never come here again I will go out of my way to other sandwich spots instead. I live across the street. The lady I spoke to didn't have a uniform on she possibly was the manager she was completely rude and did not help me one bit she said she threw it away and didn't want to take it out of the trash when I told her she should leave it up already before she threw it away.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

[5-STAR RECOMMENDATION] This Jersey Mike's Subs restaurant is located on East Chapman Avenue in the city of Orange, California. The customer service associates are very friendly! I very much enjoy the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (ask for extra buffalo sauce and extra blue cheese dressing)! I would very much recommend eating here!<//Review>

This place is slow doesn't matter how big the order I make. They take forever. I have to wait 10+ mins at the store after I made online order and set a pickup time I come on time and wait long. I'm on 30 min lunch and they take half my lunch waiting in store. Happens all the time I rarely get my order on time.</text>

It is a muddy park area, the trail is in same place's hard to climb.  But the flowers and the different kind you can see is amazing.  If you have some time, see this amazing site.<//text>

First time review: Ok the registration for walk ons was straight forward, easy, and no hassle. Better than another field around the area (not gonna mention names) I signed the waiver, paid and was ready to go. They are very rule oriented, and the refs will call you out for unsafe behavior. Would have rated it 5 stars, but the restrooms both the portable and the trailer ones are really messy. Other than that it was a great experience see y’all soon.

Side note: I went to play Airsoft, but I might try paintball next time it looked fun.  Review coming soon for “Jungle Island”  😉</Text>

Really nice place! Rentals and gear is at a very reasonable price, one thing though, when you are going to airsoft and you've done all of your work to get in you drive to the back, paintball is in the front, refs are nice and amazing, even parking there is nice, best first experience ever!!!<//Review>

Its a good place to play. Price is a little high even if you have your own gear. Went to play airsoft with a coworkers nephew. The old guys LARPing take the game WAYYYYYY to seriously. The facility and ref's are good. The players make me not want to come back.</review>

Bad location, bad maps, bad refs and treatment. Refs constantly lecture you and remind you how great they are on the field. The fields are covered with trash, bathrooms are absolutely disgusting, the staging area has no shade or coverage from the sun, parking is unorganized. Very disappointed with this site. Do not play here...< /Review>

<text>I've been playing here for almost two months and I have to say that this is an awesome park to play at! The staff are friendly and welcoming and the refs are very cool guys who keep things fair. If you have a problem they will make sure to fix the problem. They also try their best to make the game play fun by changing up different scenarios. I absolutely enjoy this park and will continue to play here and make this my home field!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The field has awesome maps, but had a bad experience with the refs. Seemed to me that they did not like being there. Aside from that had fun and would recommend due to play maps it offers.</Review>

The field is set up well but the refs will literally tell you in the briefing that they don't care about cheaters. Some have even threatened customers<//Text>

<text>Had a great time. The fields are set up well, I enjoyed all of them with the exception of firebase. The staff was fantastic especially a reff by the name of Jerry. He helped resolve any issues I had. Did some trouble with a hot headed player or two but that's not the fields fault and the reffs took Swift action to resolve said issue and make both parties happy.<//text></record>

FOR AIRSOFT: I used to be a ref, Buzz is the worst ref EVER and needs to be retrained. Had a 10 year airsoft veteran (pictured below) blind fire around a corner, under 5 feet, got in face and yelled for me to get out of his face. The "veteran" never apologized nor did Buzz care that he didn't. If you want to deal with people never calling their hits, bad/understaffed refs that just don't care about rule enforcement, come here. Due to my experience here (which was my first) I won't be returning here in the foreseeable future.<//Text>

<review>My overall experience wasn’t bad, and I have fun when I go airsofting of course. I have been many times but this time wasn’t the greatest experience. A referee everyone calls Tweety played at the airsoft feilds today on the opposing team. A first instance, he shot my friend for no more then 2 feet away, and then lectured the kid he just shot. The engagement rule is 5 feet body to body is required a “bang bang.” He has also been caught cheating by JETDESERTAIRSOFT a famous YouTuber. Another experience was he was getting shot while he was dead by a little kid who probably didn’t know any better, and Tweety goes over there and full autos him out of anger. Then goes on to complain about people being stupid. He shot the kid multiple times instead of saying something to him. He should be fired.</review>< pics>

<Text>Such an amazing time. The referee with the facial hair managing the airsoft side is hillarious. He even let my friend with glasses borrow his mask because his wasnt fitting right. Staff is super friendly. The airsoft experience here was top notch.</Text>< UserId.>

A player known as "Tweety" which is also a ref is a cheater and a jerk he doesn't care about the rules and many other player have had bad experinces with him. He ignours engagement distance and doesn't call his own hits even though he is a ref there.< /Text>

<review>What? No Carne asada? Is this a Mexican restaurant? and what's up with the dining area? Don't  they know they can open the inside for dine-in? It looks like a welfare waiting room in there. Get it together Rosa Maria.
Will definitely not go back there again.</review><time>1616866513548<//time>< gmapID>

They have the BEST BURRITO'S and RELLENOS on EARTH ~ bar none!!
I just wish they'd open a place up here on the High Desert cuz it's a long drive down the hill for take-out.  Then we could indulge weekly instead of monthly!☆!  Aahhh ~ that would be heaven!♡!< /text>

There was no other food served so we are thinking it was from here. I'm very surprised. We've been eating Rosa Maria's food for 40 years with no problems. We are wondering if anyone else had issues on Thursday October 15th at the Highland location.<//Review>< username>

The best burritos in so. Cal. Their garbage burrito is out of this world
Also their breakfast burrito will get your day off to a good start. It's  kind of difficult to see from the road, but there is always a line. The best for us is to call, put in our order, then just go pick it up. Their bean, cheese and meat burrito freezes well. We always buy some to freeze and some to eat.< /Text>

<Review>Ordered Chile Verde burrito with beans and cheese but the meat was plain, no verde sauce? O'well! Priced fare but I would pay extra to get what I want.

<Text>It was good. Wish the staff didn't look so bored,  greeted me and told me bye when I left but no they didn't say hi or bye, I know I shouldn't expect this all the time but it feels nice, you know? Anyway the food is real good, the mild salsa for chips is bomb and spicy, but the regular hot sauce for food is even better. Also the restroom is so clean. Good burritos and enchiladas. I like it a lot.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1546974979228, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing the customer service to our attention. We want all our customers to feel welcome.

<review>The food is top shelf as always but I saw no visible access for a wheelchair which I use most of the time. I did manage to get inside after considerable pain climbing a curb and a couple of steps. To someone who walks, no problem. To someone who CAN'T, BIG problem.<//review>< pics>

This is another "must stop" Mexican food establishment when we are in Southern California. We have enjoyed their meat and cheese burrito's for over 30 years, as well as their cheese quesadilla's. They are truly world famous and have great food and prices. Glad they have expanded from their small, but busy, place on 40th street over the years.< /text>

This place is great for adults. I seen some crazy things, but I had a lot of fun over all. If you want to take your children I recommend to come in the day. Nights are mostly for adults.<//review>

Was excited to come here. Very disappointed.  Everything on the menu has lard and pork. They dont serve carne asada here. The tacos I got had very little chicken tons of lettuce shredded cheese and one slice of tomato. This place is a joke..<//Text>

OMGosh the food is amazingly delicious. I got a #3 with a cheese enchilada instead of a taco, yummo!! If you like to take it up a notch, add a couple of their hot sauce containers which are right there on the counter ready for the taking. It's not too hot for me, just perfect. Service is exceptionally friendly & fast, place is nice & clean. The only problem is I live in NorCal & this gem is in SolCal. I guess I'll have to visit my parents more often 😋</text>

<text>I get food here every Sunday and I haven't found anything that compares.  Remember those huge burritos back in the day filled with meat?  Get an XL and relive it, wow!

You can never go wrong at Rosa Maria's!! Our whole family enjoys eating here.  The Chile Relleno burrito is heaven on earth, and even their bean and cheese burritos are delicious!  They also have jr, regular, and XL burritos, which makes it perfect no matter how hungry you are.  Great Mexican food!  And on your birthday, they give you a free burrito and drink - how cool is that?!!< /text>

I always get a burrito here. Probably been eating Rosa Marias for 20 years. Today however the burrito was like its been sitting out for a couple hrs. The tortilla was hard, and some of the rice was dry and hard. Not overly warm either. I hope this isn't the norm for dinner time. I usually go at lunch.</review>

This is a San Bernardino landmark.  I grew up on Rosa Maria's and try to stop there whenever I'm in town. Over the decades the quality and service has never wavered.  Gotta get the garbage burrito!</Text>

<Review>I had to take my 5 star down to a 1 star today. Wow $9 for a small bowl of menudo. And on top of that they charge you for extra lemon and tortilla? Every Mexican food place in the surrounding area don't charge for any of that and the portions are nearly double the size. I will not be coming here for menudo ever! Very disappointing!

Update: so I found a place with a worse off price for menudo. I will say rosa marias has some of the best tacos around. The burritos are also great. I'm not sold on their menudo but to each is their own. With that being said I bring their review up to a 3 star.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< review>
Aug 2019.
So I'm not from around here and I was looking for authentic mexican food.  We where near and this place had great reviews.  We went and had our food. Its definitely not authentic. The food was edible and the prices were a bit high for the flavor. It's not taco bell but not mexican. Its somewhere in between. Heading more towards taco bell taste.
Edited. Aug 2020
Forgot to mention that you will not see carne asada in the menu. Also the hot sauce has the consistency of a tapatío bottle sauce. Very limited menu.< /review>

<Text>9/12/2020 I called and was put on hold for 5 min, I finally hung up and drove ther, the place was empty, when I mentioned  my lengthy wait I got no response, nada. These women are rude af.
My burrito was cold. It was only a matter of minutes between when I ordered my food and I ate it, the cheese wasn't even melted and the tortilla wasn't soft like the old days, it was thin and dry. Won't be coming back 😐.<//Text>< response>

I've been all around California (and the rest the U.S.); this is still the best menudo I can find.

First thing -- most important -- Rosa Maria's restaurant only serves their menudo on the weekend; this is one of the main ways to tell if a business prepares their menudo fresh or simply reheats a frozen stock.

The tripe used is the reticulum section, or "honeycomb", the best type of meat for the stew -- no grease, no gristle. They boil away the fat, ensuring the meat and stock aren't oily and clouded, add the most tender hominy and give it the time it requires to properly stew.

By the time it makes its way to you, this menudo's been properly seasoned and the additional spices and trimmings the staff provide simply make an already amazing dish even more mouthwatering. To top it all off, they'll even add a meaty, tender pork bone, the perfect way to finish off such a satisfying meal.

This place is excellent. Sometimes, the beans have little rocks, but that's just another sign of freshness.

Keep it up, Rosa Maria's! I'll see you next Saturday!< /text>

Its priced way too high for a BRC burrito that is no larger than DelTaco and half of it is tortilla.  Beans not mashed hardly at all and the rice to bean ratio was off.  Too much rice makes it very dry and it sucked frankly.</Text>

<Review>Just the fact that you cared enough to reply with genuine care to my 1st review; I give you 5 stars for this...The first review was based on my ordering a bean rice cheese burrito that for $6.00 was a disappointment due to alot of rice and very little beans and cheese so therefore I felt unsatisfied and money is very tight right now.😒🙋< /Review>< Pictures>

<pics>None</pics><Review>(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went to eat some tacos the person who served me was so awful horrible but since I did not equal and they taught me education I said "thank you very kind" you know he did turn around and turn his back on the rude look at his staff because another person will not react like me or they throw the tacos in the face to the next look at your staff.

(Original)
Ayer fui a comer unos tacos la persona que me sirvió fue tan pésimo horrible pero como yo no me igualó y me enseñaron educación le dije "muchas gracias muy amable" sabes que hizo darse la vuelta y darme la espalda el mal educado vean a su personal porque otra persona no va reaccionar como yo o le tiran los tacos en la cara ala próxima mira tu personal.< /Review>< user_name>
