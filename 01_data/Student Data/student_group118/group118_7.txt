After looking at the previous reviews I assumed this place was really good. I came in at 11 am the nail manicurist finished my nails two hours later at 1pm. It literally took her the majority of the time to sand my nails down because she put a large amount of powder on my nails. She also was yanking on my hands without saying a word to me. Terrible customer service. She did remember to charge me $66.00 for a new set of nails which is extremely expensive. I would give zero stars to this place however I must put one in order to post this review.< /Text>

Well color me thrilled! I think I may have just found my new manicure place! Gelish was wonderful - quick, efficient and detail oriented. This was the best gel manicure I have had in a while and I will most definitely be back! I will just have to go in for a pedicure after work one of these days and rectify that!< /text>

< Review>
I've been coming here for about a year and a half now and I love this place. I've never been treated so well at a nail salon. They are friendly, welcoming, and accommodating.

I go to Tim every two weeks for a fill on my acrylic nails and once a month I get a pedicure with any of the talented pedicurists.

Tim is friendly, a great nail tech, and extremely helpful to a indecisive person like me! He helps me pick a wonderful style every time--he suggests new colors and designs and gets my skinny square shape right every time! I like my nails to look very natural and he always makes sure I leave the shop with clean, natural looking nails.

Show him any style on your phone and he'll let you know if he can sufficiently give you that look. He is real about what can be done and upfront about the pricing.

Tim treats his regulars and new clients well! He's busy, so make sure to make an appointment if you'd like to see him!< /Review>

There is great customer service and the place is in great quality. My sister spilled her drink on me and it splashed over the floor. I was so embarrassed but the staff said not to worry with a smile and cleaned it right up. They offered candy and water to the children and made sure that customers were happy. There was barely any wait and the foot spa was relaxing and comfortable.</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I came here 12/8/2018 to get my nails done by Tim and Trish . My friend and I had an appointment with both of them. Right when we enter we were getting helped by other ladies instead of the ones we requested for. This is my first time coming here to get my nails done and my friend recommended this place to be very good. Now we are both disappointed. First off the lady that was helping my friend was so rude and her nails looked uneven. My friend was getting a refill and the lady didn’t got close to her cuticle that my friends nail looks like it was done 2 weeks ago. My nails was done by a different lady and it was my real nails. I just wanted to shorten it and make it coffin shape. My nails look nothing like a coffin shape. It feels so rough that when I touch my clothes it gets caught on my clothes. And she rushed the gel part when I put my nails under the LED lights. I see my nails have dents on like it was set right. I’m so disappointed with this place I pretty much paid $33 for them to mess up nails even more.< /Review>< Pictures>

A few years ago another person was in charge of the place now that a new owner bought the nail store the service really went up. You can feel that your paying for good service at a good price. The nails store was a wonderful experience and I would surely go again.<//review>

Honestly the worst pedicure I've ever had. ... She wasn't paying attention to what she was doing, kept getting up to pay attention to what was going on with every other worker there, she didn't even clean my nails or trim them  She even painted them horribly. I would have been better off doing them myself. I had to tell another worker there that she didn't clean or trim my nails since she obviously didn't understand me telling her< /review>

Walked in with my 82 year old mother on a Wed. morning. Called first that they could take us and they said come on by. Very clean, very friendly, great with the elderly. We both had mani pedi's and were done in just over an hour. What I really like is that they started with the feet. Toe nails were dry by the time the hands were done. I have really bad finger nails and they cleaned and polished them wonderfully. I can't say enough good things about this place.< /Review>

I called and made an appointment for a gel full set and deluxe pedicure. I got a gel manicure & pedicure, no full set. The pedicure was good. I didn’t feel like waiting an additional 40 minutes after being there an hour, to complain and get a full set.< /Text>

Poor quality of service in Manicure as well as Pedicure. I could still feel the dead skin on my heel after the pedicure. Moreover, the girl was very slow in her job. She took 2 hours to finish my Mani and Pedi. I will never recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

Very poor service. They will sit on their cell phones instead of greeting and assisting. My last powder nail manicure was the worst job ever! Looked like a rookies job!<//Review>

Love the food I ordered. Took only about 30 minutes to serve. Service was great. Got a free chocolate cake for my mom who celebrated her birthday. Bonus: the waitress sang really well. 😁< /text>

<Text>This place was great! I had the 72 hour short rib and it was delicious and very tender.  Our server Justin was very polite and knowledgeable about the food and wine menu.   We ordered a local wine, idle hour cabernet franc I believe and it was very good.   Overall great experience!<//Text>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>The food was great, had the Cowboy Burger. Ingredients we're fresh and we'll prepared. The green bean coleslaw was very good too. The service was also excellent. The Tanaya is a great place for families with small children. I've never seen a better place for that. Last night the indoor pool was filled with kids splashing and watching a Pixar type movie on the big wall of the giant pool area. They have more activities than I can list here including archery. Great place.< /review>< pics>

For a four diamond resort this was disappointing. Service was very slow to bring out our food and refill the water at the table. Food was okay, but compared to the grill this was a huge disappointment. For the prices you are paying this should be fine dining and it simply isn't. If you want good food and good service eat at the jackalopes bar and grill.</review>

The food quality was much better than expected: from the vegetarian feta / spinach sandwich to the eggplant/zucchini one or the chicken wings, everything was spot on what you expect from a nice restaurant in a good size city vs hotel food. The one point that was not up to standard was how slow the food service was with over 30 min of wait. But at least our waiter was kind enough to give us a heads up half way. I just wish that during the 20 min waiting to get seated, we could have ordered to fix this issue.< /text>

Phenomenal staff.  Britney in particular but really, all were excellent.  Delicious, clean, large breakfast bar with lots of varieties, including drinks for $20 was perfect.

Not to be confused with Jackalope's Bar and Grill which is currently using their space while renovating that's serving expensive unseasoned tasteless sub-par lunch and dinner.<//text>

<rating>2</rating><Review>OVERPRICED and poorly cooked. I have no problem with $40 entrees, but make sure the chef can cook if you hope to have repeat business. Our short ribs had to be cut with a steak knife and the gravy tasted like the packet variety from our college days. I noticed the couple next to us sent their entree back. We didnt because our server was pleasant and efficient. Lower your prices or raise your quality. 👎👎<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80969aef8c07c5d5:0x49a3965a5a7024f2<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We enjoyed the entrees we ordered and desserts we great. Good place for dinner if you are staying at Tenaya lodge or on you way to Yosemite.<//Text><user_id>108090459139572388728</user_id></record>

This is a mediocre restaurant for a four diamond hotel. The staff is friendly but the food options are limited and not that flavorful.  I ordered room service and the hotel staff member that took my order did not know the menu options I sleceted were on the menu. So instead of referring to the menu, she told me they didn't have that item that I just ordered the previous night. To be one of four restaurants for families within a 15-20 mile radius of others I think they could do better.<//Review>

<text>We have been coming here for years.  The new chef is head and shoulders above the previous quality.  Before,  it was a good meal "for Yosemite."  now it is a  fine meal at a regional level (sf / Napa / Bay area) .  Highly recommended.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Jeffrey Whitehead</Name><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

The food, an onion soup and  lentil soup were barely edible.  The crab tostada
Had almost no crab in it.  Prices are high and food pretty bad.   A plus was the service which was excellent.  In such a lovely hotel as Tenaya, a shame the food is terrible.<//Text>

< Review>
First off this is not the bar and grill with the good breakfast everyome is talkimg about.   This is the dinner resturant.

The food was poor at best.  Overpriced and brought out cold.  The steak was a poor cut (and cold)  the shrip was also cold and obviously re-heated.  The griller artichoke hearts were jared artichokes, served cooled (ungrilled) causing the to be worse than the costo jared marrinated artichoke hearts.

The service was decent, but not exceptional.

Overall, i do not recommed this resturant.<//Review>

Food is delicious for certain dishes but as usual, the food is over-priced and it is served very slowly.

Party of 12, 8:30 pm reservation, my entree is finally on my table at 10:05pm.< /review>

< review>
-BEDROOM:   Overpriced.   We had a 'deluxe double' bedroom which I thought was more roomy than it was. ...    It was one room, No fan in bathroom, but rooms were really warm in a good way.     Great beds,  great comforters.    Nice lounge chair and desk with two chairs.   Nice touch with the robes.
- PEOPLE WITH ANIMALS:  We  brought our dog and were only charged 75$ for 3 nights.   We were not charged 75$ per night per dog like the website said.      There is not a limit of 5 dogs per day total at the lodge, like the website says,   and I counted way more than 5.     All guests with dogs seemed to be housed in one row,  on the first floor,  rooms 177 to 191,  and the back yard area was grass with too much doggie doodoo that guests weren't picking up.     LOVED the doggie doodoo bags,   the dog bed,  dog toys and water bowl.    They were very welcoming to our dog and that was great!!
-VIEW:  The lodge is renovating the pool and the back side,  and our view was a green fence with dirt and tractors.    For the price,  I was very disappointed in the view out of our back sliding glass window and thought the lodge should have said something to us, or reduced the price.      There was no tractor construction while we were there, no noise,  but,  still the view was horrible.
-HAD TO WALK OUTSIDE LODGE TO GET TO ROOM -- I thought it was strange that we had to walk outside the lodge to get to our room...  You'd think that with a hotel in Yosemite,  you could walk inside or outside to get to the main lodge area/restaurants...
-NICE STAFF  --   great staff.
-VALET:    VALET IS free,  but warning,  we used it once, called 1/2 hour in advance and when we went out,  it wasn't there....    so we self parked and didnt use valet the rest of the day.
-FOOD:    the food was nothing to write home about.
-CHRISTMAS BUFFET:   really nice.     great staff,   very good food, but again,  pretty average.
-ACTIVITIES:   we went ice skating in Yosemite,   and did ROCK CLIMBING at the lodge,..    super fun.< /review>

Amazing Church!! Love it a lot. Priests are caring and  are willing to help you in any way they can. The parking is great. The church has a school as well. Church rectory staff are very kind and helpful.< /Text>

It is very hard to find a school with a balance between strong academics and strong religious practices.  At St. John Chrysostom I found both for my children.  I really appreciated the patience and time the teachers took when working with my child.  They were strong and strict but they understood the importance of nurturing success.  Religion is not just taught but put into practice.  Through many service opportunities children learn the truth about God and his love.  The school has many wonderful programs available.  It has a great athletic department.  There is constant communication with parents.<//Review>

<Review>St. John Chrysostom is more than just a church. It's a family that unites together in the eyes of God. The priests are the most helpful and the altar serves are great as well. Everyone is caring.< /Review><rate>5< /rate><user>117967454002628136550< /user></record>

<Review>Just started attending St John's.  My only problem is that if you are sitting in the back of the church, YOU have to strain to hear the speakers in the front.  I feel the speaker situation should be checked in to.< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><text>(Translated by Google) This Church apart from being beautiful is great and there is always a place to sit, the schedules of Masses and confessions very convenient, very kind and respectful parents .. I have never heard any kind of homophobic comments towards the gay community .., this I mean to a certain written comment of a person (tonny Gmz) annoying and - Contra - obiamente of what the catholic church professes and that universally already it is saved its position with respect to this subject, that says the bible law of God! Not of man

<Review>(Translated by Google) Today more than ever the church disappointed me more. To begin with, those that give information on religious education have no education, they are rude and stop you are going to ask for something as a gift and although you pay and ask for so many things for a Sacrament for that reason many people do not even come to the church.
God never charged anything and here even because you go to church He is already telling you why you don't give more. The person was upset because I made the comment that I did not agree to leave for a retreat for two days and you did not have a phone and how could I have communication with her and she told me that that was the reason that they would not take him for my distraction, I told him that as a mother I could go and I refused, he said that I could not and how I can entrust my daughter to people I know. I have a lot of faith and I believe in God and in Jesus and in those I do not trust is in man and just as so many things already happen in the churches here and everywhere it is the same.
I want to believe more in the church but with these situations I don't believe it.

(Original)
Hoy mas que nunca me decepciono mas la iglesia. Para empezar las que dan informacion de la educacion religiosa no tienen educacion ellas, son groceras y parase que vas a pedir algo regalado y aunque pagas y piden tantas cosas para un Sacramento x ese motivo mucha gente ni siquiera se acercan ala iglesia.
Dios nunca cobro nada y aqui hasta porque vallas a la iglesia ya te esta diciendo que porque no das mas. La persona se molesto porque le hice  el comentario que no estaba de acuerdo que se fuera aun retiro x dos dias y no lleves telefono y como podria yo tener cominicacion con ella y me dijo que ese era el motivo que no lo llevaran para minguna distracion,  le comente que yo como madre podria ir y me nego, dijo que no podia y como yo puedo confiarle ami hija a personas que mi conozco. Tengo mucha fe y creo en dios y en jesus y en los que no confio es en el hombre y asi como pasan tantas cosas ya en las iglesias aqui y en todas partes es lo mismo.
Quiero creer mas en la iglesia pero con estas situaciones no lo creo.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) There is much luxury and little evangelization. Today I saw only one reader who made everything as a reader and monitor where they had a good time with the image of the virgin being able to help read or be a monitor and then at the end they (those of the Virgin's entourage) needed to collect the second collect and they did not move.

Hay mucho lujo y poca evangelización. Hoy vi solo un lector que izo todo como lector y monitor en donde pasaron bien pomposos con la imagen de la virgen pudiendo ayudar a leer o ser monitor y luego al final ellos ( los de la comitiva de la virgen ) se necesitaba que recogieran la segunda colecta y ellos no se movieron.<//review>

Setting up the move was surprisingly more convenient than I anticipated. Their customer service person was quite helpful and friendly and he had ready answers/options for all the questions/needs that I brought up during my call. On the day of the move, the moving "champs" Charlie and Alex were very efficient. I just had to sit back and watch as they moved all my stuff to-and-from the truck to my new place. They were also pleasantly chatty and funny which made the whole moving experience less stressful for me. Lastly, I appreciated the simplicity of the service: they can do whatever preps I don't want to do myself (packing, disassembling/assembling furniture); I just pay for their time. I felt less worried near my moving day because I knew that if I didn't have time to finish some preps, the movers can just do it for me on the day of the move.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Excellent service. The two gentlemen that came to move my family and I were absolutely amazing. Javier and Thomas worked tirelessly and efficiently to get us moved into our new home. The gentlemen took phenomenal care of our belongings. They were respectful of our time and ensured that we were satisfied, from start to finish. They were extremely careful with our walls also.. no damage or scuff marks anywhere. These two gentlemen went above and beyond to make our move the success it was. Thank you Javier and Thomas. 🏾🏾🏾<//Text>< pictures>

CAL STATE moving and storage, is a wonderful company that looks for their customer’s interests to be satisfied .
I do not speak for others, in my case, they were  caring and everything was delivered on time .
I mean I have a really big house. I was nervous about hiring just any moving company, so I asked some friends and they said they used these guys several times.
The company knows how to take care of their customers, as well as the customer’s things, a fact that I can know from firsthand experience from my past moves. They were very careful with my things, quick in delivery, and very mindful on making the experience as easy as possible. Anyone looking to move, and are wondering of the perfect solution. They were friendly, fast, and reliable, and before the sun could set my stuff were neatly placed into my next house. I have moved a couple of times, but I never had service like this before. I would definitely recommend this moving service because they get the job done with no gimmicks!
I cannot stress how helpful  this moving and storage was for my family and I!<//review>

Cal state moving co were very professional, hard working and respectful!
Their quote was within 15 minutes of the actual time of the move, quickly and efficiently moved my items, and provided care to my furniture.

Victor and Dwayne were friendly and did a really great job! I needed also a piano moved on short notice not only did they get the job done efficiently, but gave me a smile while doing it! Must say also it was the best deal in our area by far with quality service as well!

They moved very quickly, were friendly, and careful with our possessions. If we move again, we most likely will call them, for local or long distance.
Our family would use them again, with no hesitation! Thanks guys!!

<Text>My move went so well because of this company and the two guys they sent! Their customer service was great, their rates were reasonable, and the move was done beautifully. Charlie and his buddy were very polite and courteous, they worked efficiently, and took great care of all my stuff and furniture. If you're reading the review because you're looking for movers, look no further! I did my research and called so many companies, and I'm glad I ended up choosing this one.<//Text>< UserId.>

Everything was strapped down and no damages reported. They even went to extra mile to put items where requested at the new residence, helped with a new TV delivery on arrival unasked and grabbed recycle bins off the lawn. I've used multiple moving companies and even had my items held hostage for cash once. Use CalState Moving & Storage and you won't be disappointed.</Review><gmap_id>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9<//gmap_id>< Date>

<Date>1610418893149< /Date><Review>This was by far the best company I ever used for moving, I love CalState Moving . This is mine and my families 5 long distance state to state move. I needed to make sure that these guys where legit. The other companies I used in the past where franchises like mayflower and allied which where okay but took real long and very very expensive.. I went online instead of singing up online for quotes, I had made that mistake before. I did a move with a company y who called when I put my info online.. they totally screwed me!! I was in such bad financial hardship after that move!! These guys have me a great quote which wasn’t super cheap and what it was though was the real price and real.. these guys sent their own movers and not contractors the actual trucked pulled up and they did a great job packing all of the furniture.. and delivering me on time.. I had to schedule a service elevator for my new condo building. They showed up with all of the insurance papers for the building too which I was stressed about!! They did an awesome job!! Thanks a lot CalState Moving & Storage for a great Job!!</Review><username>Wiliam Hunter</username><GmapID>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9</GmapID><Resp>{'time': 1610555739494, 'text': 'Thank you William, SO VERY much for the rave review!

<Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><text>BEWARE! What began as an amazingly refreshingly empathetic & easy experience with Ross at Cal State Moving quickly turned beyond challenging! I will take full responsibility & advise making sure you are in your home when you are realistically listing all the items to move. After initial quote that went up over $2000 and then threatened to be more the day the movers packed the truck, be sure to read every letter contractually.  As a single female moving across country from California to Tennessee there are many uncertainties. The less than stellar customer service team of Annette and Melissa increased the difficulties beyond belief! I can confirm they got the job done with good Packers and excellent Drivers.  If possible try to deal solely with Josh and Ross , the only two on the team with any compassion and professionalism. I was fearful to submit a review until my move was complete. Genuinely Relieved in Tennessee!<//text><UserId.>106018263561209556261</UserId.><Time>1618265400225</Time>< user_name>

<time>1611847876980<//time><rating>5< /rating><review>HIRE these guys!!! I I had used them for my house move, 2 years ago, and now my boss asked to relocate our office, on a very short notice. I might say I found our new moving company. The crew of 6 knocked it out of the park for us! Took them less than 8 hours with packing. Well-mannered , considerate and polite, careful with all our belongings and home. Professional. Patient. They disassembled and reassembled everything with ease. They moved some large pieces and some really heavy pieces and they did it like it was nothing. They have some highly skilled loaders, qualified, and on top they are reasonably priced, overall great service guys ! Most definitely the most organized i’ve ever seen so far. The movers called 30 min before arriving. Rescheduling due to rain was a breeze. They were prompt. Didn’t really slow down. Just for a quick lunch 30 minute break.
The movers arrived on time, worked quickly and efficiently and moved all of our items with no damage. Very professional. I never would have believed a move to could so smoothly, but they were awesome. Not one bit of eye rolling or look of exhaustion when nearly difficult tasks were asked of them. All of the guys were young and fit and each had varying strengths , so it led to a perfect move from a smaller house to a larger place.
They moved us 2 days after New Years and moved our 3 story townhouse in one day!!!! They’ve got a lifetime customer in ME. . I would use these guys again and again and again no question.<//review>< pics>

Hi you all, happy NEW YEAR !!! don’t even know where to start. My move turned out so great, I am very happy. The best movers I've had in a long time!!!
On move in day, I was contacted by Anette she was certainly very upbeat and outgoing and very conversational. Cal State moving was recommended by my neighbor.
Crew of 4 showed up, was respectful and introduced me to his crew. Crew involved , Shawn, Mike, Tony and Peter. This had to be one of the best moving crew. As soon as a they came they looked at my stuff and let me know how much time it would take then got to work. I will say that they were very careful with my wall mirrors (I have a lot of them)
They not only take care with items being moved, but they are also careful not to damage other property in the move, such as walls, stairs, and floors. The movers are fast and efficient and do not complain while meeting challenging tasks, such as moving heavy exercise equipment three floors by stairs or watching out for walls and doorsways.
While moving can be stressful, at least using these folks alleviates otherwise an inevitable stress.
I’m very appreciative with this company and definitely would recommend it. They were quick and made sure all of my property was packaged neatly and I had no issues. If I could get this group again, I would!</Text>

Definitely the foremost response and arranged system I’ve seen while checking out moving labor assistance. Love the platform they use for scheduling and tracking everything from start to end .

I’d hire them again needless to say . i used to be skeptical about selecting moving help due to all the horror stories. I researched a couple of of companies online before finding them. once I found them, I felt very comfortable with a choice to rent them. very happy .<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The Cal State movers and I worked out a storage deal, one of my tenants hired them to help them move their items. The people working were very polite and worked very hard to keep everything protected from the rain, winds, and other things.
Top notch. There is a reason these people have been in business 15 years. They do things the right way. If you’re considering a move, do yourself a favor and call these guys. You won’t be disappointed.
Professional, respectful of me and my belongings, would definitely recommend and use again.

<Review>I highly recommend this moving company. They are not expensive and moved all my things with no problems. They even let me go with them in their truck because I don't drive. They are quick professional and make sure all of your things are safe and sound. The moving crew are also extremely kind and time efficient. Worth every penny!<//Review><username>Daniel Jack<//username></record>

The guys were very professional and careful with my more fragile belongings. They worked quickly and efficiently. They even reorganized my storage unit to be more easily accessible. Hands down the most seamless move I have ever experienced.< /text>

<review>Moving across the country is stressful enough and finding a trustworthy mover can be tough. My experience overall was so-so but I have to give 1 star because a box with my expensive kitchen appliances went missing and I recently realized a JBL speaker was taken from one of my totes. Ultimately this could have occurred anywhere in the logistical chain of command but I cannot recommend a company who loses or takes expensive possessions. Too risky!!< /review>< user>

<review>Salute to CalState Moving & Storage for their splendid work. I planned for the move in collaboration with their manager and I was able to book a day in which I was free and their vehicles were available. The manager was considerate enough to give me a call a day before the moving. He confirmed the move and early in the morning a crew of movers arrived in my home and passionately embarked on the work. They worked tirelessly throughout the day and were able to finish before time. The delivery was timely and nothing was missing by the end of the process. CalState Moving & Storage are the best movers.</review><name>Leo Benson< /name>< Time>

Moving can be tough. They were efficient,  friendly and made the whole experience easy. I've used them twice now and would use them again hands down.

Everything arrived in good shape after nearly a year we kept our stuff in their storage. Cal State moving employees during both packing /pickup & delivery were incredibly respectful, polite & most of all hard working.
Personnel had to navigate challenging situations during both, but not a hint of complaint from anyone. No complaints here on my part. I appreciate everything they did for me. Great job guys !!!< /text>

For our relocation from Los Angeles to Dallas we used CAL STATE MOVING. My initial contact with Melissa in sales was pleasant and we discussed the inventory to be transported. Got call from the dispatch then coordinated the moving, Used them before for local moves, and every time they were wonderful. This last trip the 3 men worked quick and kept all our belongings super safe. The crew were extra nice, kind and respectful. Our truck driver was Javier and crew Danny and Ali and they were excellent!! Kept in constant communication with us. When he arrived at our destination, he was able to maneuver his semi into very tight spaces. That made our moving process quicker and easier.  He also took care of our special high value items ensuring they were protected appropriately. I would highly recommend requesting Jose as your driver for you next move!!<//text>

< review>
Don’t use | Run, away! Took three weeks, no call backs. The worst is they wanted to charge me an additional $1200 the day they came. $75 for each 7 steps... I had to rent my own budget trucks  when they got local to get my stuff and then bring it home. They said there were zoning laws to take semi on a residential... however, your a moving company!... How is that the customer’s problem. Why does the client have to figure out your logistics.

Lied several times, and will promise you the world. They just wants a sale, and once you contact don’t expect a call...

The driver, told me to meet him in a target parking lot the day of at 5. An hour and a half later he finally showed up. He was rude and unapologetically, threatening, and destroyed our some of our furniture. Completely unprofessional. I have no clue how they are in business. Watch out!!!< /review>

CalState Moving  where is the moving company that every skeptic move her dreams of. They are patient and very willing to explain the process. To an outsider it can be very overwhelming and easy to get caught up and stuck for thousands of dollars. We are every day hard-working people who don’t have money to burn. So selecting the right company was crucial. They get all the packing of the larger furniture as well as the smaller boxes all we had to do was let the movers in. We got a great price and a friendly group of people to handle the move and we couldn’t be happier. Call them yourself for a quote.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I have one problem - I am so mean when it comes to giving appreciation and credits. I will only appreciate something when it is worth it. That has made a couple of friends brand me as someone who looks down upon people. I do really believe that because, especially after the services offered by CalState Moving & Storage. Why did I get to appreciate their work if I am that mean? Their job was perfect and I must admit that. It was not that bad. The relocation services were worth paying for. The crew came slightly earlier to help me with the moving. There wasn’t that much difference compared to those I have previously. However, there was this striking feature about their workers, their sense of organization. The crew was so organized and I love them for that. I like it when people are orderly and that is why I might consider them in my next hiring out.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPO4DnD-2ZPRjz7p10OI7wBtzuvmfVEyl0asqth=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>{'time': 1609345381158, 'text': 'Thank you SO VERY much for the rave review!

Great Service, Affordable price!Cal State Moving guys were great with our house move. They were helpful with scheduling and planning.  They arrived 20 minutes before schedule and were ready to roll.
Communication was clear. Throughout the whole process they were very professional and enjoyable to work with.
We were able to book them a week in advance at a very affordable price. Reception and email confirmation were clear and easy to read. Andrey,Mike and Javier were super fast and nice. Cared about our stuff like their own. They worked fast and careful to make sure nothing got damaged. It was really great to have such a good group of guys to help us move our big furniture out of the a really awkward basement.

I highly recommend their services !!! I would use this company again and will recommend them to any family/friends.</review>

<review>HIRE these guys!!! I I had used them for my house move, 2 years ago, and now my boss asked to relocate our office, on a very short notice. I might say I found our new moving company. The crew of 6 knocked it out of the park for us! Took them less than 8 hours with packing. Well-mannered , considerate and polite, careful with all our belongings and home. Professional. Patient. They disassembled and reassembled everything with ease. They moved some large pieces and some really heavy pieces and they did it like it was nothing. They have some highly skilled loaders, qualified, and on top they are reasonably priced, overall great service guys ! Most definitely the most organized i’ve ever seen so far. The movers called 30 min before arriving. Rescheduling due to rain was a breeze. They were prompt. Didn’t really slow down. Just for a quick lunch 30 minute break.
The movers arrived on time, worked quickly and efficiently and moved all of our items with no damage. Very professional. I never would have believed a move to could so smoothly, but they were awesome. Not one bit of eye rolling or look of exhaustion when nearly difficult tasks were asked of them. All of the guys were young and fit and each had varying strengths , so it led to a perfect move from a smaller house to a larger place.
They moved us 2 days after New Years and moved our 3 story townhouse in one day!!!! They’ve got a lifetime customer in ME. . I would use these guys again and again and again no question.<//review>< pics>

The CAL STATE MOVING & STORAGE did a great job, they were able to come and move the remaining items over to our new house within the estimated amount of time and also transferred my safe out of my house and into my new house without an issue or damage,
they also kept my stuff in their storage for 2 weeks and gave me a break on the price, charged me for 3 pods, 1 pod was free.
They had my 3 bedroom home all moved out and into my storage unit within 7 hours.
Guys were extremely professional and efficient. From scheduling the move to unwrapping the final pieces, everything was to our satisfaction including the great price.
Would definitely recommend them and use them again.<//Text>

<text>Team from Cal state movers were super nice, reliable, highly skilled loaders, professional, affordable , overall great service! Definitely the foremost response and arranged system I’ve seen while checking out moving labor assistance. Love the platform they use for scheduling and tracking everything from start to end .

I’d hire them again needless to say . i used to be skeptical about selecting moving help due to all the horror stories. I researched a couple of of companies online before finding them. once I found them, I felt very comfortable with a choice to rent them. very happy .<//text>< Pics>

<text>BEWARE! What began as an amazingly refreshingly empathetic & easy experience with Ross at Cal State Moving quickly turned beyond challenging! I will take full responsibility & advise making sure you are in your home when you are realistically listing all the items to move. After initial quote that went up over $2000 and then threatened to be more the day the movers packed the truck, be sure to read every letter contractually.  As a single female moving across country from California to Tennessee there are many uncertainties. The less than stellar customer service team of Annette and Melissa increased the difficulties beyond belief! I can confirm they got the job done with good Packers and excellent Drivers.  If possible try to deal solely with Josh and Ross , the only two on the team with any compassion and professionalism. I was fearful to submit a review until my move was complete. Genuinely Relieved in Tennessee!</text>< rating>

<review>Good reputable company. Guys working for them are the best.
The movers were extremely professional, fast and done carefully.
The price quoted was exactly what I paid.  It was not based on time.
Flat fee was given to me based on total volume.
A previous move by another company a few years ago was a nightmare.

Ronny and his two well trained men showed up at 8 AM as promised. We had limited packing of kitchen items and personal clothing, and many unpacked boxes to move and some furniture.
We were out of the old home by 12:30, stopped for a quick sandwich and were completely unpacked and in our new home by 4 pm. Excellent service and as promised. Rates were very fair. This was a pleasant surprise.
I would definitely use them again and recommend them to friends and family.<//review>< UserId.>

<text>Once I spoke to CalState Moving & Storage I didn’t feel the need to talk to any more companies. We spent over an hour on the phone and I sent emails with some pictures of my furniture I had questions about. They knew the ins and out of the business. They explained to me what to expect during thier service and how to protect myself financially. I was able to get a cross country move door to door for a fraction of what I anticipated. I read a few different sites and saw a lot to like. They do quality work and don’t leave a mess in the house. I was able to get updated any hour and I would give thier name to anybody who asked.<//text></record>

I used this company since they have very high level and grade. They didn't disappoint me . In fact, their guys showed up on time, 8 am as stated, they put protective gear to protect both us and the house.
The guys were professional and got the job done. They didn't goof around and try to waste time. They worked very hard. We moved from a two story to a one story home and I felt bad when they had to move heavy furniture from upstairs.
They didn't complain once.
Could not ask for a better, smoother experience. These guys were the best, totally professional and extra careful. We had art and precious stuff and they took better care of it than we did. I'd use them again in a heartbeat.
I would highly recommend using them to move you. I hope to not move soon, but
I am also calling them to get the storage next .
Thank you again guys.< /text>

The Cal State movers and I worked out a storage deal, one of my tenants hired them to help them move their items. The people working were very polite and worked very hard to keep everything protected from the rain, winds, and other things.
Top notch. There is a reason these people have been in business 15 years. They do things the right way. If you’re considering a move, do yourself a favor and call these guys. You won’t be disappointed.
Professional, respectful of me and my belongings, would definitely recommend and use again. Thanks guys!< /text>

The Cal State Movers crew were amazing. They completed my entire move within the 4.5 hour . Wrapped the necessary furniture, assembled and disassembled without any issues, no scratches on anything. He also made another stop to drop off storage.  Packing, loading, drive to destination and unload. Team of three good guys who were polite and professional. Nothing broken or damaged. Really happy and would use them again for sure. Will definitely use them again.  They can also works on the pricing if you ask them nicely !<//review>

<Text>These guys from CAL STATE MOVING were amazing! So professional! They covered my railings so they didn't get scratched, they never once complained even though we had a TON of heavy stuff to move up stairs!! They were so quick too. We had two  16' POD they did in less than 4 hours!!
Very thorough and quick! Will definitely be using them if I ever move again. The company worked around a scheduling error on my part as well, which I dont think many companies would do. Great experience.
Amazing work !!! Many thanks, I would use them again and I will recommend them to everyone!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPq1H6XFgbMs7bYAg8-w6dZC7qnfJKFU00737c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<review>Once again, CalState Moving and Storage handled our move to perfection, from my 1st call to their pulling away from the new place.  I have used them on numerous occasions, with very valuable antiques, and they have never damaged a single item or any walls or floors.  They had to carry a huge couch up 5 flights of stairs on this move (elevator too small) and not one word of complaint.
Each crew I've had works very quickly, efficiently, congenially  and knowledgeably.
THANK YOU, CalState Moving and Storage!!  You know we'll call you next time!!<//review><username>Linda Hedderick< /username>< date>

I was extremely impressed with them. I got estimates from a few other places, and  Calstate Moving gave me the lowest estimate (and had good reviews). I was really glad I went with them! The office people were really polite and helpful. The moving crew got there a few minute early. Everything went really smoothly. They seemed to be very methodical, yet efficient. Wrapped everything up very securely to protect my stuff (my piano!) and even things I didn't care about (old particle board stuff). Packed up my 2-bedroom condo in few hours. The delivery at the new place was just as smooth. They really knew what they were doing and seemed to be organized really well. Overall, I felt they really cared and wanted to do a good job, but were very efficient! Great price too! Lower than the estimate both in price and in time. I'd definitely recommend them!</Text>

<review>By far the worst and shadiest company. Showed up 3 days late for pick up. Were not responsive for those 3 days. Showed up a month late for delivery and the driver was the only mover. He asked a random person on the street to "help him move a couch" and then threatened him with a box cutter when he tried to leave because he was not licensed to assist him. The driver then asked if he could run to home depot for workers. We said no and luckily had some friends come over to help unload. The driver did not keep track of what came off the truck, so we had to go through every single (smashed) box and item afterward to see what was missing. We did this ourselves because he refused. We were the last group loaded on the truck, so a lot of stuff was missing. None of our TVs were in the batch of items and the driver told us to take another TV off the truck that was clearly someone else's. We were horrified and said no. We paid to have furniture taken apart and then reassembled at our destination. Obviously nothing was reassembled. While unloading the truck ourselves, we called the company to ask for movers to arrive and they repeatedly hung up on us and then stopped answering. They eventually showed up a second time, weeks later and with no notice, with more of our items. Still missing stuff. It has been a nightmare. Really wish we would have just rented a truck and done this ourselves. They also told us we could pay with card and then demanded cash the three times they showed up. Awful people. You've been warned.< /review><time>1610560757297< /time><rate>1< /rate>< Response>

I had to move for college all the way across the country and there was no way I was going to drive two thousand miles in a box truck. My brother moved with his family a few years ago with CalState Moving & Storage and he still had their contact information. I only had a one bedroom furniture set and a living room to move. It was a far move but I didn't have all that much to spend. They applied a college discount and since I was referred by someone that used them in the past they took off another two hundred dollars. They were a bunch of good ole guys and was pleased with the price!</review>

I would LOVE TO give them guys 6 stars if I could!! We had Andrew, Mike and Steven. From Cal State Moving help us move from LA to SF. They did a fantastic job and were friendly, professional, and efficient. They wore their masks the entire time. They started by giving us an overview of the whole process, which was helpful. Then they handled all of the furniture very carefully, making sure to wrap valuable and fragile items in plastic wrap and/or fabrics.
After they assembled the bed frame in the new house we actually changed our mind and decided we wanted it switched out with another bed frame. Andrew and Gutierrez were so nice about that, and didn’t seem to mind disassembling and reassembling the bed frames at all. They were so nice about it.
Overall excellent experience. Would highly recommend CAL STATE and special thanks goes out to crew and office guys : Melissa , Sarah</Text>

<Text>Cal State Movers  did a great job at a fair price.
They were easy to reach, set up an appt at short notice, and were professional and friendly.  The movers worked hard, Mike, Alex and Dmitry were unfailingly polite and smiling (beneath their masks), and helped me dismantle and set up my bed when I was having problems.  The three guys conducted my move were super professional, personable, attentive to my directions and truly concerned with safeguarding my property amid getting it where I needed it to be.  They knew what they were doing and did it well.
They worked as an effective team in communicating to move things around obstacles and tough places.  I am very pleased with the results and amazed by the quality and professionalism displayed.
Thanks, and I will use your services again and recommend you to others,
and I will highly recommend them for any local move job you may have.</Text>< Pictures>

Fantastic, reliable company.   I had an excellent experience with them. After 10 years I decided to move back to LA from Portland Or.
After doing some research, I called these guys and was immediately impressed by the customer service. I got a very reasonable and affordable quote, and the customer service rep was happy to answer my list of questions about packing, timing, and process. The movers came on time and were very professional and knew exactly what they were doing (parking a large truck on a small busy street in the east village was not a problem for them).
It was a seamless, quick and easy process. They delivered my belongings in perfect condition to my LA home. This company offers free storage for up to 30 days and delivery is included in the overall price. Being so overwhelmed with such a big life change, I felt so lucky to have picked this company/service. They made my life a lot easier. We are grateful.😍</text>

<Time>1602600291943<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is the best company that I have ever dealt with!!! The three men that came out were friendly, respectful, hardworking, polite, and didn't even take a break/lunch. They arrived around 9am, and didn't leave until 4pm. They fit everything in one truckload, nothing was damaged, and the one even used his own pick-up truck to transport our mower. After they moved everything in, they headed back to our other house to load up our junk, and dispose of it.
I was so impressed, and have told everyone that I know. Great company, and great employees!<//Text>< pictures>

Do not use!

I ended up going with this company over another of similar price due to their ratings here. They started off great and they were super responsive until they had our stuff. We moved from SF to AZ and we were told 14 days tops but should be sooner as they had a ton of drivers. Upon pickup they increased our cost by $2K once it was loaded. Then it was delivered 30 days later with over $11K missing. They confirmed they have our items, I even offered to pick it up but no response from Melissa, Jeff or Mike. They blocked our numbers and now we are dealing with police reports, insurance claims and everything else. Do business elsewhere or better yet get a pod, hire some task rabbits and know all your stuff with arrive to your final destination,

If you want to see the true experiences you can also check out their yelp page. I've spoken to the others and we've all had the same experience.</text>

The guys at CalState Moving & Storage were nothing short of outstanding. They were organized, careful, efficient, and cost effective. The whole job of loading and unloading an entire 3 person apartment to a new location only took 2 days total and they handled EVERYTHING.

They came prepared, wrapped our furniture and handled fragile pieces with care. The guys were very polite and friendly, making the whole experience painless. And on top of that, it was a huge job that came in well under the expected cost. I would recommend them to anyone who needs to move and I will definitely be using them again. Thanks guys!</Text>< Pics>

Didn’t show up for the 2 scheduled days to pick up for our move and came late on the following day and the movers gave me a number to contact to follow up and receive a discount for the inconvenience. The managers Daniel and Agustine have been dodging my calls and messages when I’ve tried to contact them almost every day for two weeks! Terrible customer service and terrible communication.</review>

I have no more doubts trusting their crew with moving. These people are so reliable. When I gave them an opportunity of moving me, they ensured everything was perfect. I felt awesome during and after the relocation services. I wish they can be able to do this even in future. It was such a wonderful thing seeing them moving me. I wasn’t so optimistic that they were going to make it through. It, therefore, came as a wonderful surprise when this team was able to move me from South Carolina to Georgia in a flawless way. That was the least of my expectations.<//Text>

Cal State movers are AMAZING! They were efficient, professional, and did a wonderful job. I had a last minute move. They were professional on the phone and were able to fit me in last minute during the busy summer moving season. Most companies were booked already and I could not find anyone.
These folks were timely, fast, and professional. They brought their own supplies and worked hard to fit everything in the trailer truck.
I had 3 bedroom apt worth of stuff and I needed moved a long distance to a new house. The crew finished with their morning job and called to check with me whether they could start early. Which was good. it was very short notice.
Did I mention they had to drive all the way from LA TO OREGON ? Good work. Pleasant to deal with, Mellisa was awesome as well.                      The team worked hard and cheerfully.
Definitely look into these guys. Also get a temporary no parking permit, it worked wonders. I was very pleased and they came highly recommended.</Review>

I used this company since they have very high level and grade. They didn't disappoint me . In fact, their guys showed up on time, 8 am as stated, they put protective gear to protect both us and the house.
The guys were professional and got the job done. They didn't goof around and try to waste time. They worked very hard. We moved from a two story to a one story home and I felt bad when they had to move heavy furniture from upstairs.
They didn't complain once.
Could not ask for a better, smoother experience. These guys were the best, totally professional and extra careful. We had art and precious stuff and they took better care of it than we did. I'd use them again in a heartbeat.
I would highly recommend using them to move you. I hope to not move soon, but
I am also calling them to get the storage next .
Thank you again guys.<//Review>

CaL State Movers by far was the best moving company I’ve ever worked with. Their website format and ease of booking is superior.
Can't say enough great things about my team. Special thanks for the care , punctuality and for just being awesome guys... it was a great experience from every standpoint. Moving is so very stressful, you really don't want to take a chance on anyone but I would say if you haven't used
The movers even arrived EARLY which is soooooo rare. I’m in shock that none of my belongings were damaged because for some reason, other moving companies can’t seem to get that part right! But these guys were not only professional, super friendly, and SUPER hard working in the heat - they were also quite careful, and I appreciated that. We highly recommend them!<//text>

I'd like to thank the CalState Moving & Storage team for a great long distance moving experience. I was very careful which company I'd use to move my things from Florida to New Mexico, so I took my time researching Florida companies. I was fortunate enough to find CalState Moving & Storage, which offered excellent customer service, answering my many questions, and the driver who delivered my items was on time, courteous and patiently reassembled my furniture. The original crew that packed my furniture did a great job as well, wrapping the expensive pieces in blankets that resulted in very few blemishes. Honestly, with all that I had, there was only one broken china cup and one area on a table that was slightly marred by packing tape. That's it! I am a very happy camper and strongly recommend this company to anyone making a move. Trust is the name of the game when it comes to choosing a moving company, and I trust this one 100%! Happy moving!</text>

Good reputable company. Guys working for them are the best.
The movers were extremely professional, fast and done carefully.
The price quoted was exactly what I paid.  It was not based on time.
Flat fee was given to me based on total volume.
A previous move by another company a few years ago was a nightmare.

Ronny and his two well trained men showed up at 8 AM as promised. We had limited packing of kitchen items and personal clothing, and many unpacked boxes to move and some furniture.
We were out of the old home by 12:30, stopped for a quick sandwich and were completely unpacked and in our new home by 4 pm. Excellent service and as promised. Rates were very fair. This was a pleasant surprise.
I would definitely use them again and recommend them to friends and family.</review>

<Text>Cal State Moving and Storage are highly qualified, i do not know what people write, it was not my experience. We had a BLAST !!!

It was a great experience! I've never used a moving company in my entire life. We have had family or friends help in the past. It was great the response that I received from spry movers because I actually had another moving company set up and then they informed me two days before the moving day that they overbooked....UNBELIEVABLE!

Very organized and responsive. Office stuff called with updates and ETA's.
Ali came out and gave me a reasonable quote, to which we agreed.
On the moving day the crew came on time and worked around the clock 8 am sharp as promised. They were very polite and very professional. They moved everything very carefully. They helped with every detail, took down my TV off the wall and even installed my curtains, said no problem. Which is not included in their job duties.

They had great attitudes and never denied a request or complained. They moved at a steady pace so it's not like they were slow ( other companies do that on purpose ).</Text><Gmap_id>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9< /Gmap_id><name>Jeremy Crosson<//name>< date>

This IS such a wonderful company, with an excellent customer service. They were very helpful in answering all of my scheduling questions when I had to move this past week.
I was worried about the move but their informative answers put me at ease.
The workers showed up on time and worked hard to help me get my home packed up. A lot of what I had was antiques and glassware, I was really nervous to not have control of my precious belongings. The workers reassured me that nothing would happen to my belongings and that they were well wrapped in each box.
Upon arrival to my new place, they inspected each box or item to make sure nothing was damaged along the drive. NOTHING WAS DAMAGED! I could’ve jumped for joy. They dived right in and began unpacking the truck and helping me settle in to my new place. They placed each heavy item in its designated spot and made sure I didn’t need anything else before the left. I would highly recommend this company, you cannot go wrong!
I highly recommend them for all your moving needs.</text>

<Text>Moving can be really expensive, you want to make sure you go with a company that is going to stick by you through and through. I never lost contact with Calstate Moving and Storage as has happened to me in the past with another mover which cost me time and money. I work for Coca-Cola corporate and had to relocate for my new promotion. Anybody looking to make a long-distance move I want to tell you from my personal experience that this company is solid, you can believe they are going to give you the most Quality Service all around. I highly recommend you go with them as opposed to these other movers out there. You never know what to expect with some of those companies, but these guys are what I call Legit.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO36F0B4omvWpZ9pQroMWtp91mQoaWFK-aBQrjj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

I expected results - average result. Having seen the favorable quotes, I did not expect anything beyond the normal moving. During the moving, therefore, I was keen enough to take note of slight mistake. It was fruitless. These crewmembers were keen with their work. They wanted everything to work out the perfect way and they did not fail. They remained awesome throughout the moving. Such level of commitment and professionalism inspire me so much. I know I am going to seek their services again. I cannot just wait for that moment to come again. I am sure I will love it. I enjoyed my first experience with them. I have every reason to believe the second one would be similar if not more remarkable. Thanks. Moving from West Virginia was easy because you were in charge. I want more of what you offered me.😍</Review>

This is the worst movers you can deal with. They have taken a deposit from us  and on pickup date bunch of arrogant unprofessional folks shows up , telling you have to pay double (as you have more stuff-agent miscalculated )even after proper inventory details been shared(this is when your agent won't lift your call or return any voice mails). When we objected and wanted to talk to agent/manager, no one was picking our calls. After some time pickup guys just left without informing us on anything about it. This is the worst service one can get. 10's of call , emails and voicemail messages and no one care to respond back.
Stay away from this fake scammers. They are here to cheat you. Stay away from them. They got some fake review here.<//review>

These guys did an outstanding job for us. Out of all the mover groups I have had in the past, these guys are by far the best. On my move from  Georgia to Southland, California, they were quick, efficient, organized, and SUPER friendly which made for a very pleasant and non stressful move. I must add that moving over 3000 miles with nothing broken is a pretty amazing accomplishment.
They even surprised me and followed up to make sure everything was going smoothly for me. I would recommend using this moving company to my friends and family because I know I certainly will.
I would 100% recommend this mover to all my friends and family. Overall it was a great experience!< /review>

I was looking for a moving company online and came across CalState Moving & Storage website. I called them and Tony in customer service picked up. He was super polite, and said he would transfer me over to his moving specialist John. I was really concerned about how it would all work and the cost of a long distance move. John was able to explain how the movers would do everything for me and was very thorough. We were able to get it within my budget and I couldn't have been happier how it all went, nothing damaged and all of my furniture arrived. Thanks CalState Moving & Storage!</Text>

< Review>
When looking for a mover, you want a company that seeks to be in this business for the long haul, lest you get disappointed with the hungry money movers who care less about the quality of service. I was really careful with whom to trust on my move to Sanford, North Carolina from Manchester, New Hampshire. After doing my research, CalState Moving & Storage came top and I decided to use them. This company is not rated as the best in Manchester and the rest of New Hampshire for nothing. The movers were very understanding, helping me wrap my mattresses and they professionally wrapped and packed all my things.<//Review>

<Review>Once I spoke to CalState Moving & Storage I didn’t feel the need to talk to any more companies. We spent over an hour on the phone and I sent emails with some pictures of my furniture I had questions about. They knew the ins and out of the business. They explained to me what to expect during thier service and how to protect myself financially. I was able to get a cross country move door to door for a fraction of what I anticipated. I read a few different sites and saw a lot to like. They do quality work and don’t leave a mess in the house. I was able to get updated any hour and I would give thier name to anybody who asked.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFAXokSySvTgMc99C8vkwp5RRpj2ngo5et-Z1_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

REWARD OFFERED for missing items! They lost one of my boxes which had all of my personal family/childhood items, photos and an urn with ashes! My fault for trusting them with these items I know. I moved 09/20...if anyone has these items (as I also received stuff that wasn’t mine) I would love to get them back!<//Review>

I have used moving companies severally in the past and the experience wasn’t always what I envisioned. At one time I ended up losing all my things to a fire that had apparently consumed the van that was carrying them. Others have been very poor communicators with below par service. I, however, had one awesome moving experience when I moved with CalState Moving & Storage recently. The movers were polite and well trained in handling people’s properties. I liked them so much.< /Review>

This moving company helped my family from start to finish. They gave me a great quote.
Spoke to Tony, he explained all very clearly.
3 movers team showed up, everything went well. I thank the sales representative for helping me out to get this move on the go and even offered some discounts.
Thank you guys for all the support and for helping me. It was honestly genuine and sincere for you guys helping me out because I was in a tough situation trying to look for a great move. I just want to thank you guys once again. I will recommend all family members and friends to this moving company. Thank you for excellent job and service!!!</review>

These guys are fantastic. Submitted a quote request on their website, got a GOOD rate (which was better than other services we contacted - cheaper than OTHER piano moving service ) and had a baby grand piano in our living room about 12 hours later.
We needed our baby grand moved quickly for some emergency work needed in oour house.
We called them late afternoon and were able to come one time and quickly move the piano for a very reasonable rate. Very responsive and professional people
They texted me every hour with update on driver ETA.
The 4 guys were great - on time, professional, friendly, polite, and careful with my things, most of all my Steinway baby G piano.You cannot move BBG with 2-3 guys, 4 is a safe way , they have to lift it , tilt it , unscrew the legs, so these guys took the stress out of my morning.
I do highly recommend them, best to move piano with the house, because most companies have the minimum of hour, so you should always incorporate piano move with the house or office move, best advise I can give. Thanks,Good job guys 👍A++++ service<//review>

They quote slightly higher in the beginning but from what we read they always try to come in lower, just in case they underestimate the time it takes.  But they definitely work with you and there were no gotchas in the end. Their pricing was definitely good. Would 100% use them again and even request the same team!!</Text>

Great job you GUYS !!!
Frank and Chriss and Alex showed up on time and cheerful. They kept calling me "boss" or "patron" , even though I insisted they call me by my first name. It actually became funny after a while, so we just went with it despite how hot the weather got and how heavy the boxes got. I kept offering water and bananas to the guys but they politely declined and just kept muscling through the move.

From the first phone call to inquire through the move they did a great job both moving and communicating. No hidden fees or surprise charges.
They even gave me 5% OFF for military discount.
The office called the day before to confirm and they were there promptly when they said they would be there. I had a 3 man team show up and they got right to work. All the things they moved arrived unbroken or undamaged and they placed the items where I requested even moving and item or two when I changed my mind.
They wasted no time loading and unloading and took away all debris when they left.
I would highly recommend them for your move.All guys are very helpful and polite.< /review>

Great job!
This was our first time using movers and we could not be happier. They arrived on time and worked quickly and efficiently. Everything went smoothly and before we knew it, everything was at our new home and they placed the furniture where we asked. The price was very agreeable and the guys were wonderful. We definitely recommend CalState Moving &Storage.  Will use them again if needed.<//Text>

<user>101590848578976453185<//user><Pics>None<//Pics><text>Cal State Moving & Storage is not a pleasant company to do business with. The process started OK, then the day of the pickup we should have guessed how the rest of our move was going to go.
We stated "SEVERAL TIMES" that we had a safe & even provided it's approximate size & weight & asked if their packers would have the proper equipment to move this safe. We where assured that they would. NOPE! They had nothing but a small four (4) wheel dolly. I had to use what equipment I had at my disposal to get our safe on to the dolly then in to the truck. This is all video recorded too.
At the storage shed they basically "tossed" our packed belonging & other items in to the truck. They told me they "needed another truck" because we "exceeded" our space limit. Which was a full twenty six foot (26') Budget truck. Another truck & crew just happened to be in the area - with someone else's belongings loaded in it - & came to the shed. They finished tossing our belonging in, since there was room they went to my daughters house & picked up four (4) extra items. Those items where loaded when the packer came to me & told me there would be an extra almost $4,000.00 charge - because we EXCEEDED OUR SPACE LIMIT. I disagreed & was told that I needed to take it up with the office the next day BUT I had to sign the paper work saying they had picked everything up & the extra charges where on it (that I didn't agree to).
Next came the question of when we wanted our stuff delivered. I told them that 22-23 Oct. 2020 would be fine, because we had to finish some business, then drive to Northern Idaho. Wouldn't a person "think" that they would just drive the loaded truck to the drop off location? NOPE!
Cal State picked our belongings up on 18 Oct. 2020 & after SEVERAL CALLS, asking where our belonging were - we FINALLY RECIEVED our items on 19 Dec. 2020. And, Cal State basically extorted more money from us before they would even load the truck for delivery. Then demanded more money before the truck would be unloaded here in Idaho. Speaking of trucks, the packers couldn't pack everything up in one truck at our storage shed BUT, AMAZINGLY ENOUGH, JUST ONE (1)  TRUCK of the same size twenty six feet (26') arrived here with ALL our belongings, including the four (4) "extra" items.  Actually there where two (2) twenty six foot (26') trucks - the one just had a box spring in it, which could be picked up with one hand.
The safe?? - this crew was even LESS PREPARED, just one hand dolly. They ended up calling a towing company - same one that they called the day before to pull them out to the, ditch that they drove in to the day before - to PULL my safe out of the truck, then off load it in to my shop. The "contract" was to have the safe but in to our house. That DIDN'T HAPPEN & the safe is still in the shop.
I have tried calling, again, to get the safe moved in to our house - like it was supposed to be in the first place - AND to file a claim for all the broken & damaged items. But no one answers & you can't leave a message because the voice mail box is always full & can't except any more messages.
If Cal State is the only company available for your move - DO IT YOURSELF!! You'll be much better off.< /text>< rate>

Cal State Movers  did a great job at a fair price.
They were easy to reach, set up an appt at short notice, and were professional and friendly.  The movers worked hard, Mike, Alex and Dmitry were unfailingly polite and smiling (beneath their masks), and helped me dismantle and set up my bed when I was having problems.  The three guys conducted my move were super professional, personable, attentive to my directions and truly concerned with safeguarding my property amid getting it where I needed it to be.  They knew what they were doing and did it well.
They worked as an effective team in communicating to move things around obstacles and tough places.  I am very pleased with the results and amazed by the quality and professionalism displayed.
Thanks, and I will use your services again and recommend you to others,
and I will highly recommend them for any local move job you may have.< /Review>

I just finished my move with CAL STATE on 11/6/2020. This is an awesome company. I got soooo many quotes before I decided on a mover. Most had little clauses like an extra $75 for every 75 feet, $75 for every 6 stairs, etc. I knew with most of these companies they would find a way to tack on additional charges by the time my stuff was delivered. Also I was confused about the whole cubic foot thing! He is Great< /Review>

The machine is huge and heavy, and 2 guys Dima and Ali were awesome.
Tricky and hard part was to get it into the place, they solved with a smile.

They called ahead of time to let us know they were on the way. Once they arrived, they worked promptly and efficiently to get the move done as quick and easy as possible. Would definitely recommend them to others for their moving expertise.
They took good care of my vintage furniture without me even having to ask them to be careful.
Moving during COVID wasn’t something I was looking forward to but these guys really came through, thanks CAL STATE CREW !!!
Would recommend them 100% and will hire them again in the future without a doubt!<//review>< Pics>

I cannot understand why people hate moving. I find it to be one of the most interesting things, especially when facilitated by Calstate Moving. These people know how to handle clients. They offered me the best of moving services and I am longing for more. The best of the best - that is the least I can say about Calstate Moving. Otherwise, I am short of words. Their excellence is something I cannot fail to talk about. I will forever be grateful for the services offered. When they came to assist me with moving services, they did it with so much dedication. They were very careful not to tarnish their good name. Now that I have confirmed their unwavering reputation, I have no doubts involving them in my moves.🙂<//Review>

The movers were very prompt when scheduled to come and started packing up my belongings. I tried to help but they insisted on taking care of everything. Boxes were secure and fragile items were placed carefully in bins. Movers were very polite and always made sure they didn't miss anything or if things were in the wrong place etc. Thank you CalState for all your help! Very much appreciated!</text>

The salesman promised a 28' truck that would deliver and fit in the circular drive of my new apt in Florida.  I requested quotes from 5 moving companies and chose Cross Country Movers based upon their competitive quote and my interactions with their sales guy, Annette.
I was impressed with her, responsiveness, polite manner,
so I thought, attention to details. She went over the inventory list, room by room, item by item to insure that he was providing a "quality" quote. He assured me the quote was good, that all items had been accounted for, and that we were good to go.

They were extremely friendly and professional. They answered all of my questions and got me a quote quickly. I would recommend this company to anyone who needs a moving service. I have dealt with moving companies a few times during my time in college and each time I found something dinged or chipped by the end of the move but with them everything was in perfect condition.</text>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><text>The Cal State movers were exceptional, professional and easy to talk to regarding our concerns for the safety of our homes and their furnishings.  These four movers worked diligently and carefully to protect our furniture and to make everything fit into the two trucks provided for the move.  Complete with dismantling , bookshelves, treadmill taking  upstairs and then assembling it in our lower level at the new house.

When they arrived at our new 3 story home in Cerritos, the movers were faced with many challenges with the 2 stairways and the large pieces of furniture we were asking them to move into the 2nd floor and the lower level.  Denny, Victor and Dwayne were masters of visualizing how the impossible could be achieved without any harm to our walls or our furniture.  I can't say enough about the great service that Dwayne provided from the ease of providing an accurate estimate to the professional way the move itself was handled. I will use them again no question about it.</text>< Pics>

They are fast and professionals! I got a quote for Melissa ,just moving furniture but
Ronny and Dave got the furniture in so quickly that they had time left for pretty much all of the boxes , which I had planned on moving myself. They were both very nice, courteous, handled the furniture with care.Nothing got broken Cal State Movers are the best value around. Another local moving company quoted me literally twice  as much for the exact same service. TODAY every penny counts. I lost my job, so I'd rather hire reasonable people without fancy charges piled up on me. Thank you Guys !!! Till next time. Good job !!<//review>

The team I used were pandemic-ready professionals, who packed & moved us to go long distance across 3 states, did it all with kindness & respect. From initial contact with Annette through connecting with dispatch (Tony) and finance (Emma) to our amazing crew lead (Ronny), I cannot say enough positive things about this experience.
Price-wise, this was also the most reasonable quote, both with timeline and price----I was really so pleased. Price was very acceptable, under our budget.</Review>

<date>1612309087949<//date><rating>1<//rating><Text>Check the BBB and Yelp reviews, the vast majority of the reviews here are plants. This is the worst moving company I have ever dealt with.They will not reassemble your stuff per their own contract.  Read the reviews of the stuff stolen - we are finding stuff every day that is “missing”.  Once they leave your premise, you cannot get in contact with them - they purposely leave their voicemail full. A guy named Lucas will be one of the sales guys - STEER CLEAR of these thieves.

North American has always moved us, as they are family clients, but they were booked solid, so I decided to giveCalState a try. I never had any trouble with any moving company. When the price increased 2,500 dollars (even though all our stuff fit on the truck) I thought it was excessive but still paid.  Fine, OK, just get our stuff  here.  I called to give January 10th as a target date.  I have moved several times and know there may be a variance of a day or two.  The problem is that I, the customer, had to call on January 8th to get an update.  It took a while as Cal State’s voicemail is left full so that you cannot leave a callback number.  Finally someone called and told me it was going to be up to 5 days “IF” they packed up that very day.  It was already past the 10th of January.  I told her that was excessive to which she actually asked me (the customer)what my target date was - did she not have it on file before she called me????  Puzzling and unprofessional.  I told her I was not happy (while she kpet talking over me) and then she said “I call to schedule you and this is what I get?!?” Really unprofessional.

Two movers arrived at 2:45 P.M. with a two man subcontracted crew (I knew that they would have to be there very late in order to get the job done correctly).  I had cash to pay up front and the driver proceeds to tell me that they will not put any beds together.  I told him that was a breach of contract and ask him if he even has tools - He does not. The two man subcontracted crew did have tools and said they would take care of it.  I tried to call the CalState office realizing it is always futile in attempting to do so because they will not answer and their voicemail is purposely left full. I have text messages and phone calls for the past two weeks documented where I received no responses and the voicemail stays full leaving no way to leave a callback number.  At any rate, with the two subcontractors having tools and saying they would take care of it, I paid almost 5K.

The two movers unloaded stuff in my garage and let the other two subcontractors move stuff in.  Boxes and other articles started piling up.  They emptied the truck by around 6 PM and told the subcontractors they paid to have them until 7 PM to which I said nothing has been put back together and that is not enough time.  They left.  The subcontractors, to their credit, stayed several hours past 7 PM.

So my 900 dollar gas dryer has a huge indentation in the front - I was going to sell it b/c I need an electric one here but now the value has deflated miserably.  I have stuff still in cellophane.  I have my daughters bed not put together and various  tables and chairs still not assembled per the contract.  Our ladders are missing along with my tools and a large mirror.
We are finding stuff everyday that is “missing”. You have been warned.< /Text>< Pics>

This was a terrible experience. First, if you're contemplating a move, contract directly with a mover (not these guys) and not a broker. Be careful! We used a broker (Pinnacle Van Lines, LLC) and it was a costly mistake. Pinnacle contracted Call State for us and that is where the troubles began. Despite having detailed measurements from us, Pinnacle underestimated our load size by HALF so when Cal State showed up to move us the whole deal had to be recalculated. This was an out-of-state move (CA to AZ 600 miles) so timing was critical. The first half of the move ended up costing us almost as much as the entire estimate by Pinnacle. Cal State did send four men to pack the furniture and we did most of the boxing ourselves. What did have to be packed/wrapped was done well so I felt better about the extra cost however because of the bad original estimate, Cal State couldn't load everything and items had to be left behind. You sign a document stating when your shipment is expected by you but Cal State can hold your items up to 30 days to consolidate loads. In the waiting period our inquiries were constantly bounced from one person to another, promised call returns that never happened, etc. It took a couple weeks for our belongings to be on the road to us (supposedly). The dispatcher tells us the load is coming from Phoenix (about 3 hrs. away). An hour after they were supposed to arrive I call the dispatcher and he tells me they are broken down in Payson (about half way here). On the third day of that story I get the address of where they are, get hold of the auto repair business there and they don't know anything about it. The whole story was a lie. That afternoon, dispatch calls me and tells me another truck is on the way. He has trouble with his GPS so I have to go find him in the nearby town. And....he's alone. To unload, unwrap, and set up furniture from a 2,000 cubic foot load that four guys packed! I found out from him that he had driven from Los Angeles that day with our stuff verifying dispatch had lied to us up to that point. My wife and me (both in our 60's) had to help this fellow unload (at around 6 pm) and unwrap furniture so he could get back the moving blankets. We finished around 11:15 pm. While we did have some breakage it was fairly minimal, the actual moving men were great, but the service level and commitment to the contract by Cal State was TERRIBLE! Never use these guys unless you're having them move you across the street.<//Review>

This has been the worst moving experience ever.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!  They were responsive before the move, but after getting our money we have been unable to get any information as to the whereabouts of our furniture.  The movers that loaded the truck were deceptive about how much of the truck our items took up, actually lying about what the numbers on the tape measure said!  They also refused to fill in the "delivery no later than" section of the bill of lading, so my daughter was standing out in the dark with the truck loaded under pressure to sign an inaccurate document and our representative MIke Stone did not answer or return multiple calls.  Thirteen days later he has still not returned any of our phone messages.  Thirteen days and no word on where our things are....only that they are in a warehouse in California awaiting pickup.  In other words, they used a consolidator after assuring us they did NOT to get our business.  My pregnant daughter is sleeping on an air mattress on the floor of an empty house because of their incompetence.  This isn't even mentioning how much they under-estimated the initial cost despite our detailed inventory list.  Total cost is double the estimate.  They lied and told us that they did not use a consolidator.  We have left so many messages with no return call, and when we do reach a human we are promised a call back but have only received one call back to tell us they have no idea what's going on.
And we really have no recourse except to warn other people about this company.  Hard to believe the positive reviews after our experience.<//text>

<gmapID>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9<//gmapID><review>Please please read the Better Business Bureau complaints lodged against this business!  I will file my own complaint there today.  This is a true bait and switch company... to the tune of an additional $1600 for me,  I have asked to speak to management no less than 5 separate times and left 2 emails asking when my items will be transported to Virginia.  They were promised on 11/13, then on 11/17 and guess what.. as of 11/17/20 they are still on a truck in San Francisco.  So who knows what type of mice, rats and mites are running amuck through my personal belongings as I type this review.  I'm so disappointed in myself for not researching this company deeply.  Don't fall for the "5 stars" ... on here ,those may be friends and family who left those................I'm strongly considering legal action.. that is how dirty this company did me.  Special note:  Any time you have to threaten to call the police because they won't unload the truck when you realize they are taking your items hostage for 3 weeks when you were promised 5-7 days and the reply from management is a cold hearted "go ahead"... need I say more????

They damaged my desk, pedestal for nightstand and lost the parts to my bed....now I'm on my mattress only.  They only sent 1 mover...they did me so dirty.   Stay away!!!< /review><Resp>{'time': 1608326913743, 'text': 'You did write on BBB website and we addressed the issue Annette. Accusation you placed \'  "disregard 5 stars on here ,those may be friends and family  " can be construed as defamation and one might be found liable, we appreciate if you immediately remove the phrase that is damaging to the company, we also have lawyers and can file counter law suit. That has no merit whatsoever and it\'s baseless accusation.\n\nWe replied that for any damages person can file a claim, nobody can guarantee nothing ever \'s gonna happen, especially when moving out of state, longer distances. We have a claims dept and another number she can contact. We follow the law, you are welcome to file a claim, they will go according with insurance company that either you had ( included for free ) or if purchased extra.\nIf you decided not to purchase additional insurance, they can issue a smaller refund, we\' re not hiding, if anything found that was done incorrectly, you are entitled, follow the steps , we answered you already.\n\nEverything was explained in great detail, writing to BBB will not help resolve , unless this customer contacts us directly.\nIf there is any refund owed to him/ her, they will get one. But we must follow rules and regulations established by the state.\nA person has to go to proper channels and call us directly , either to resolve over the phone or file claim properly,  though,  so we can address it properly and he can be advice what to do next. We are super busy during the last few days of the month, like the 30th and 1st, but we are here from 9 to 5 pm daily.\nWe’ll be more than happy to spend some time and resolve any issues.\nMost people nowadays do understand, we are all going through a very difficult period in time, delays can be expected. Sometimes the drivers or moving crew may quit in the middle of the move, and we are looking for substitutes. People are paranoid about Covid 19 and meeting with people face to face. Covid pandemic affects every kind of business , we are operating under a lot of stress and with limited resources , even if a truck breaks down on its way to the destination point, it is tough to find repair stations in the middle of nowhere. If someone reports they do not feel well, we immediately will replace them , but may take a few days to find substitution. Anything can happen, these big rig trucks drive hundreds of thousands of miles across our nation. Do not expect a 7-day delivery, those days are over. Some things are beyond our control. We try our best to deliver between 15 to 21 days. And if we are late, beyond 21 business days, by law, a person is entitled for some compensation, $30 per day for each day we are late with delivery date. They can always contact our office. If busy, try again in 20-30 minutes, we experience an unusual call volume. Same as AT&T , T-Mobile, local cable, any service industry out there. We ask people to be more understanding and more patient. Delays are to be expected. If we are late for any reason, you can collect $30 for any late days over 21 days allowable. Again, there are rules and regulations and we do abide by those. We\'re here for you all, and you can contact us anytime , you have our number, ask for Melissa or Tony'}< /Resp>< name>

Fantastic job,  we had a very difficult move, but these 3 curtious young men made it seem almost effortless. Special thanks to the crew and office team ( Melissa and Anette ) . They took care of everything, even the disassembly and reassembly of beds and frames and other items.
We were well pleased with there services,they were on time and handled there job well, Dima , Duwayne and Javi did a great job,we would recommend them to our family and friends.
They took every precaution make sure nothing would break in transit and pointed out items that needed special care that shouldn’t go in the truck.  They Also gave some great tips on the washer and dryer arrangement, great advice.
They made the stressful moving process a breeze. Highly recommend!<//text>

Terrible communication. When I got my estimate the salesman promised all movers would be required to wear masks due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When the movers came to pick up, they said it was not a company policy and I had to fight with them and almost had to call the company to get them to comply. About a week after the move, a dispatcher calls and says my stuff was packed onto the long distance truck and would arrive on the agreed on delivery date, also on the signed contract when they picked up. A few days later, the driver called and said he would be there 2 days early. This sounds good, but we were mid cross country drive and could not occupy the house until the agreed upon delivery date. This is where the terrible communication comes into play. We spent the entire day calling Cal State Moving trying to get a hold of a manager to figure out what would be done. The driver continues to call us because no one at HQ seemed to think it was important to keep the driver in the loop. At first, they told us they would pay to store our furniture and then pay for a crew to drop it off on the correct day. Then the driver calls us and tells us he is waiting in the city 2 extra days, at his own expense, not the company's, to drop off our furniture on the desired date. So again, we call the company, spend hours trying to get a hold of a manager to confirm what is happening with our furniture. Eventually, we talk to someone who knows what is going on, and we continually ask for all new developments in email to keep a record of what is happening, but company employees give us attitude about asking for everything in writing, since they keep miscommunicating with us and internally. They could also not be reached delivery day and would not call us back. When the stuff arrives, we are told we will need a shuttle since we have low hanging trees on our street, but the price on the contract is different from what they charge and have on the online estimate. They broke a few things, which is expected during a move, but they make you sign the delivery receipt before you see everything is broken or not, making it impossible to file an insurance claim. It's good the stuff came on the day we wanted it to, but the company is impossible to communicate with if an issue arises, which almost caused many car accidents on our drive due to stress and trying to call from the road. Their prices are different depending on what document you are looking at. They are not enforcing their Covid policies.<//review>

<user>110783325943722904980< /user><Review>Do not let “Dani Renee” sell you the dream - If she’s even real. She had me cancel my other moving company to work with her and once i paid everything turned into an absolute mess. All of their departments do not communicate properly to one another. It took them an entire month from pick up to drop off from SF to Boston. I had to call them repeatedly to ask for updates as well s re confirm multiple times the correct address as they had it wrong every single time.

They gave us zero heads up when they were picking up our belongings and gave us a 30 minutes heads up when they promised 24 hours for the drop off.

They then dropped off our belongings at the storage unit and 4 items were missing and we also had then inherited some other persons 5 items in which the company REFUSED to turn around and pick up until we continued to beg them so that we could check the truck to see if our boxes were in the truck. They ended up not being there - the truck was an absolute nightmare with packages everywhere and now we have no idea where our items are.

I called multiple departments we didn’t get one apology from the driver or Calstate themselves. Now we have to file a claim via a third party which does not provide us with any timing or likelihood of my belongings being replaced.

As someone in sales you’d think your original sales rep would be available to help in this situation but now my emails are being blocked and the number I’m contacting no longer exists... what an absolute night mare. This lady really had me tricked.

All in all. Don’t use them - they do not care about anyone’s items. They want your money and that’s it

Great service and a pleasure to work with. Frank, Sasha and Johhny were extra supperb and efficient and I must say - very experienced.

They were courteous and professional. They packed up and moved out our entire downstairs in a timely and efficient manner. Some larger pieces required creative solution to get it out the door and safely place on the truck. The crew handled all the challenges without a problem. We look forward to having his crew handle the our return move back into our home.

They took such care to protect all of our furniture and electronics, and ensured to read each box and place it in its correct room, which has made the unpacking so much easier! Thank you !Nothing was damaged in the move and they were on time and polite.  Movers were all great helping and very kind! We decided to give them extra $100 to split , they deserved it. I’d definitely use their services again if opportunity present itself. See you next time !!!<//Text>

These men were incredibly helpful. They handled everything so polite, clean cut and professional. They gave us great moving tips and smiled the whole time.

The whole team with Mick, Dima and Alex. Were Exceptional and careful.
They moved countless boxes and heavy items out of the second story building very quickly. They then moved everything up four flights of stairs very effortlessly, and did so in a very fast manner.
We were extremely nervous at first, but they were pro's, arrived early, worked extra  hard and quick. The whole move was finished early with no any kinda damages at all!  It went smoothly and efficient.
I thoroughly recommend this company and if you are lucky enough to get this crew, you will be in good hands.
Everything was in one piece start to finish, no breaking. We will be contacting the company again for future moves. Thank you so much!< /Text>

LOOK AT OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS
all the negative reviews have people agreeing with the description and all the 5 star reviews are clearly fake

quoted me a reasonable price for 400 cubic feet , movers came to my house and said it was more that 400 cubic feet and bumped up the price 4x the original price and said everything I was moving was 950 cubic feet, I denied the service, nothing was moved and stole my deposit,  needless to say I rented a penske truck with a cubic volume of 800 and not even half of it was full this company is 100 percent a scam do not recommend unless you want to give away your money</Text><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9< /gmap_id>< time>

< Review>
No clue how they have so many positive reviews!  Maybe they are better for local moves.  Quote to move a small (700 sq ft) 1 bedroom was 1,980 which then turned into over 4k at 10pm at night. That is a huge jump and you are stuck because they load your items and then demand a ton of extra money.  I normally wouldn't dispute extra charges, but they are low balling cubic feet quotes to get business.  The moving experience also was not good at all to even warrant the 4k. Cal State is non-responsive.<//Review>

They came over and told me how to minimize costs. 4 guys did everything very quick even hoisting some furniture with no problem. I recommend this outfit with complete confidence.

I'm a College student moved back to CA, very impressded by teh service.
It was really quick and easy both for pick up and delivery, and the people were very helpful! As a 20 year old handling moving across the country on my own, I really appreciate how communicative and helpful the company was every step of the way.

Fabulous company. The crew loaded the moving truck in record time. Delivered to east coast in record breaking time and all things
arrived in great shape. Unloaded the truck at my new residence
in record breaking time as well.
They were prompt in terms of the timing and facilitated an end of month move.
Best service ever!<//review>

<review>What a pleasure it was !!! Mike, Alex and Javier are 3 strongest work horses I've ever had the pleasure to work with. They all dived in, moving from a 2 story apt to a 2 story apt. They never slacked and had incredible energy and enthusiasm for hard, heavy labor. For being flesh and blood guys, they worked liked machines .

The way they wrap, handle, and care for your belongings and home is unlike any other company I've ever worked with. For perspective this is my 8th move in 7 years.

They wrapped every piece of furniture, put a protective mat on the main walk ways through the home, wrapped door frames, bannisters, etc. to prevent any damage (to be honest they never even got close to a wall/door). I would hire them again in a heartbeat!! These guys WORK and they work FAST! There is no down time for them. I'm probably forgetting half of the amazing things they did but could not be happier! They truly went above and beyond in every aspect!!!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Excellent experience. Their working crew showed up right on-time. They worked quickly and efficiently all day. All of my furniture was shrink wrapped and packing blankets were utilized. At no extra charge!  All of my property was safely transported and unloaded. No- damage to any accessory.

<text>How a $7600 estimate became a $22,600 bill. Moving to work at a nonprofit in Chicago, I had to cover the relocation cost for me and my family, so I did some bidding. Lucas Wood (lucaswood@movingandrelo.com) at CalState gave me a “binding moving estimate” of $7600, which included a number of discounts. I provided Lucas with a detailed inventory of what was being moved, and included videos of our apartment and storage unit to make sure there weren’t any surprises. They seemed legit, so we hired them and gave a deposit of a little over $2000.

Three days before the move, Michael Stone (mikestone@movingandrelo.com) in quality assurance called and walked thru the details. He knew nothing of what I provided Lucas. Either that or Lucas didn’t accurately assess the move. At the end of our call, the estimate jumped to $18,000!!!! I tried to find another moving company to move us on the same date since our lease and travel plans were locked, but nobody could do it as quickly as we needed. I provided the binding estimate to other movers, who said they could do the job at $9000 if we could wait a week ... which we couldn’t. Knowing this would destroy our savings, we reluctantly signed and gave an additional $3000 to the deposit.

The day of the move, the team showed up in a truck smaller than we were promised, and the foreman had no clue about any discussions I had with Mike Stone. For example, Mike said the first flight of stairs are free; the foreman said it would cost extra. Mike said that boxing up our computer and TV screens would be comp’d; the foreman said they were additional charges. To add to the confusion, the team was from Impala Van Lines, which means CalState is a broker even though they advertise differently.

The team worked hard and well, but the smaller truck meant they filled the truck before they were done. They had to drive to storage in order to offload half our contents to make room for the rest of our apartment. To add insult to injury, the foreman came up with an additional $4000 in charges to push the cost past $22k! My wife and I were almost in tears as that represents years of savings.

I’m trying to negotiate with Mike Stone and hope to edit this review with an ending that isn’t as horrible ... to be continued.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Most Accommodating, Hard Working, and Friendly Movers

My relationship with Cal State Moving and Storage did not start out cleanly, but it ended very well.

They had a minor trouble in Dispatching the movers to my first location on my moving day.  However, they corrected it fabulously with a discount and help with a broken lampshade later on.

The movers were fast, professional, and polite.  They worked as hard as I've seen anyone work.  They lifted some of the heaviest boxes (my apologies for creating such).

Their supervisor was accommodating as well, in that he brought them food and drink on-the-job, so that they could get back to work quickly, BRAVO!

I Highly recommend Cal State Moving and Storage</Text>

<Text>I wanted to say how pleased I was with the amazing job you and your team performed. Before the move, you and the rest of the staff explained us how they would pack all the household goods, and how they would help us to be ready to move. We were well prepared. On the day of the move, the movers were there on time and an amazing job, making sure that things were placed on trucks carefully and in the most logical manner. I am extremely happy to witness their professionalism which is hard to find. Al in all, I will recommend your company’s name whenever anyone needs to move. Thank you.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x80d954ebb6fc3d33:0xed59723a048b70f9<//Gmap_id><Text>Calstate Moving & Storage sent false and predatory advertisements to lock in our sale. They offered a discount and faster delivery service as part of a "piggy back move" because they were already completing a move in that direction, however they failed to meet our drop off day by several weeks. They said only a $200 deposit was required to secure the move, but then 2 days before pickup was scheduled they demanded a 30% deposit even though more than 50% was due at pickup anyway. They refused to come to our home to give us an estimate, so I recorded a very detailed video of all the stairs and belongings for them to provide an accurate estimate. They offered a binding estimate of $4490 but when they arrived for pickup told us it would be $6000. They offered auto transport for $1050 which we agreed to on our contract, but once we gave them the deposit they told us the car transport was actually with a different company, Experienced Auto Transport, who missed our pickup window by several days and charged us $1400. Once they failed to meet our drop off date by 1 week, they requested an additional $600 for expedited shipping. The day before drop off finally arrived (21 days after pick up) the driver claimed it would cost around $1000 extra to shuttle our goods because he didn't think the semi truck would fit down a huge street with a large parking lot and school directly in front of us. We had about $1000 worth of damages to large furniture which was not packed properly. Not all items were labelled with numbered stickers making it incredibly difficult to mark inventory of our shipment. Calstate Moving & Storage locked us in with low prices and attempted to up-charge us every step of the way.< /Text>< Response>

<review>We had a contracted move for 9/28 or 29th they completely ghosted me and never showed! Then had the nerve today to act like they have been desperately trying to get ahold of me! That’s funny today your email and calls come thru. I would avoid at all costs. It’s one thing that something came up scheduling wise but to completely avoid me and now try to get ahold of me is ridiculous. This stunt has added 100s of dollars in costs to my move and added stress.< /review><date>1601502229650< /date>< Rating>

What a nightmare...Don't use them!  Sorry this is a long read but I need to vent!  I contracted with Cal State Moving to do my cross country move.  I really liked the person I spoke to on the phone and they had a 4.5 star rating.   My original pick up date was scheduled for 8/17 at 11am.  11am comes & goes no movers no phone call.  I call them.  Their truck broke down & are waiting for a mechanic.  They will call me back and let me know.  3 pm rolls around, I call them again.  The truck is being towed.  So we schedule a new pick up date of 8/18 at 10am.  730pm on the 8/17, I got a call that they would be there in 45 minutes. I told them no, we are already scheduled for the next morning and that they can't be loading the truck at midnight.  The next day rolls around, 10am comes and goes, no movers and no phone call.  I should have cancelled!! I called them.  "Stuck in traffic"??  Lies, Lies They did another job before mine.  They got there at 130pm & didn't leave until 530pm.  I should have looked at their truck before they left but I didn't .  They were in a hurry and I was tired.  I paid extra to have 4 of my paintings packed by them and I gave them the dimensions of all of them.  They didn't bring the right size boxes so my last and most expensive painting was packed jerry rigged with a garment box.  I didn't know they didn't put a blanket or wrap my filing cabinet, bicycle, lamps and vacuum cleaner until the delivery happened.  So  I asked for a delivery date of 8/25.  8/25 no delivery and no phone call.  Called them, they are waiting to assign a driver.  I called them pretty much daily.  Still no driver.  So finally on 8/27 I asked them.. Where is my stuff??  It was still in a warehouse in Hayward!!!  In the meantime, my old cell doesn't work here, so I had to get a new cell phone and number which I gave them and they never gave to the driver. 9/4, they may have a driver & would call later with the details. Not.  Finally 9/14, I get a phone call from them that the driver has been trying to call me.  I gave them a new # since my old phone didn't work here. They obviously had my right number since they called me.  Anyway, they gave the driver my right number and he did call me.  We set up a delivery for 9/15 and he said yes they would have to get a shuttle to deliver my stuff to me for an additional $1250. Ugh.  I called the main office and got that cut by 25% at least but still I had to pay them almost $3500 at delivery.  He called me in the morning of the 15th and said they would be here at 3pm.  Well 3pm comes and goes.  No phone call.  Called him, they are running behind and should be at my house at 630pm.  630pm, I call, they are "half way loading the truck and are 45 minutes away"  In New Jersey!  Lies again!! They finally arrive at my house at 930pm, pitch black at my house in a truck that is covered in graffiti.  Not to mention, no masks in sight.    Of course they wanted the cash first. When he opened the back of the truck, OMG.  Most of the boxes had collapsed. And I only had my cell phone flashlight to look at stuff.  My bike was missing the front tire.  "It came off"  I'm not sure if it's broke yet or not. The metal 2 drawer filing cabinet is so bent, I can't open the drawers.  The 2 lamps are bent and unusable.  The vacuum cleaner is missing a vital piece for operation. I had a heavy duty large plastic bin that the top is destroyed.  Halfway through the main driver asked if I was going to "take care of them"  I'm assuming he meant a tip.  Seriously.  Anytime, I mentioned any damage, he got very defensive.  So when they finally got things in, the first thing I did was unwrap that painting that wasn't wrapped properly.  And guess what, the frame is cracked!  My jewelry box has damage and that's just the first few things.  So now I have to deal with them for a claim.  Based on what they've done so far,  I'm not holding my breath!  But I do finally have my stuff now.  Now I just need to unpack and see what else I find.  Then get my claim filed<//text>

<review>STOLE OUR STORAGE GOODS....PLEASEEEEE LISTEN TO ME!! DO NOT HIRE THIS SERVICE. I recently hired this service for a long distance move from California to Texas. The movers were supposed to have it delivered by July 31st which was the day i moved. Joe had contacted me several times assuring us of our move  and the date. Once our things were picked up from storage they did not arrive  on the date they were supposed to , we could hardly reach anyone, Joe stopped answering calls, and here we are 2 weeks after they picked up my stuff and they have no clue where it is ...please save yourself the heart ache as we are devestated in an empty house . I am in tears as I type this.. SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM DO NOT HIRE... search hard for the reviews,  check out the BBB  before you spends thousands on a move ( $3200 to be exact)..also Melissa , who calls you about your material being picked up is absolutely incompetent!</review>< Pics>

What an absolutely fantastic job Dyma , Sasha, and Vadim did. We’ve had this crew before and we request them every time we need movers.

If you need a big job or small job, this crew can handle everything and they take the stress out of moving, quick, no stress job.

I highly recommend Cal State and this crew to anybody looking!<//review>

The movers from CalState Moving were super meticulous and careful with all the furniture, electronics, decor, etc. We were particularly impressed at how professional and efficient the guys worked. They worked carefully and quickly, and were able to pack up everything within a few hours. Moving is supposed to be stressful and time consuming, but this company was able to alleviate all of that stress for us. Thank you again!<//Review>

<text>The actual packers were very nice; however, every other part of the move was horrendous. I was charged  approximately $2500 more than quoted on the spot and the truck was over a 1.5wks late. When unloading, the movers told.me that they could not stack the bigger items in the back of the storage unit because they had to store it the way it came off the truck. This was not an unreasonable request. After booking, the agents were no longer as accessible by phone to voice concerns. Horrible experience without any attempt by the company to provide customer service afterwards.< /text>< date>

I have moved several times over the last 10 years and dealt with many moving companies and CAL State Moving and Storage is the only one that I have returned to. Shawn and John were amazing. They moved my things with care and treated them as if they were their own. I highly recommend their services. I’ll be back in six months to use them again.< /review>

<Review>When I graduated college, I needed to move all of my things out. When I was doing my research with different long distance moving companies, CalState stood out since they gave me the most competitive quote that was within my student budget. I told them the deadline I needed to get all my things out since my landlord was rushing me out for new tenants and they were accommodating by showing up on time and getting all of my things packed.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Date>

I was a little nervous to make the cross country trip because of packing but you all really saved the day for me. I was scared my new landlord wouldn't have the key for you guys to get in when you arrive. Anyway, It All worked out because you guess were so professional and kind. Moving a two bedroom condo was tough but you all got everything here on time, even my car came quick!</review>

I only had 1.5 bedrm worth of stuff. Hired them to do the move . I’m also a student, they applied 5% discount, which was nice. On the day of the move, Vlad and Dwayne called 30 minutes before their arrival, showed up  at the appointed time 8:30-9:30.  It was a move for a few large items including a bed, armoire, closet, tables, etc.  When they were about to transport the mattress for my bed, they washed their hands to make sure it stayed clean and was not stained by dirt.  They listened to our directions, and were very polite.  I highly recommend CALSTATE MOVING & STORAGE , with two thumbs up!  Thanks to these guys -- the difficult task of moving becomes rather easier. Really can't say enough positive things about these guys. Ronnie and Victor helped me through 2 moves, both of which weren't the easiest logistically. They made every part of both moves fast & flawless. For the time, energy, money, & hassle they save you, it’s worth it. If anything, they're underpriced. Same service you get from large company like   would cost you twice as much , if not 3 times.  Truly some of the best value you'll EVER find with a professional moving company in the San Fernando Valley and surrounding areas. THANK U FOR GREAT JOB !!!< /review>

<review>My wife and I recently moved all the way from MA to CA. In a move that big (and expensive), there's a lot of coordination involved and a lot that can potentially go wrong. We tried to plan it out as best we could, but some dates changed, which added additional complications and expenses into our already very tight budget. Long story short, we ended up working with CalState Moving (specifically Shaun and Alex), and they lent us a helping hand that we desperately needed. Without these guys being as hard working and kind as they were, and willing to help us through our situation, we would've been living in an empty house. I highly recommend these guys to anyone.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I strongly believe that all of this was well planned, it makes perfect sense and is pretty smart if you think about it, Colonial Moving & Storage if a Broker so what they do is cold call you using information they obtain from U-Haul, Penske & Budget Rentals (we know this because those were the 1st three we called before talking with Colonial. So, they get your info, make contact and give you a price significantly lower than quoted by the moving companies. They then have you pay a deposit then sell you contract to another company, obviously they are all working together and know this. Calstate Moving & Storage, Hermes Moving and Storage& Cross-Country Movers in our case. Calstate then controls the contract and uses its other businesses as sort of buffers, if the other businesses get in trouble, fines or complained on they can always just Do Business As (DBA) with a new name. Now instead of having to complain on one company in one state your dealing with 4 (or more) companies in 2 different states.  Now it becomes difficult to file a complaint of a law suit.
Here is what we have done and are doing.

We contacted the Better Business Bureau who gave us an amazing amount of information and insight. We filed a complaint with them on Calstate Moving & Storage, Hermes Moving and Storage & Colonial Moving & Storage. We contacted & filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation in California, New Mexico & Florida. I contacted & filed a complaint with the Federal Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. We contacted and filed a complaint with the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Whistleblowers Association and the California State Attorney Generals Office. We contacted and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (who put our names on a list for a class action law suit) and Immigration Customs Enforcement. Every where we called to complain were very helpful and gave us insight into contacting another agency that might be able to help. We are also in the process of posting complaints to My Moving Reviews, BBB, Yelp, Google & Yahoo Reviews so that no on else ever gets scammed like us.

I was very apprehensive in utilizing a moving company however after the great team player, John came under the quote of me doing this move which also included auto transporting a vehicle this seem like the best decision.  I paid $1,290 deposit to secure along with giving my credit card information.  When auto transport (Ronnie) called and advised of services that he would provide, agreed on amount and he stated he would send receipt via email however it took me calling back to obtain receipt and never did I provide a method of payment, my credit card was charged.
The quote for the auto transport went up $50 dollars on day of pick up and I said to myself this has to be paid therefore advised driver would have monies @ time of delivery.   The day of move my quote doubled due to all that had to be moved and had to accept and allow Victor & Jose to do their  job.  I was asked to sign paperwork and gave Victor, foreman  a cashier check $1,505 the amount advised to have @ time of furniture pick.  Victor advised that a call would be coming from accounting due to the increased quote and amount that they wanted me to pay.  I received a call from accounting advising if I would be able to receive furniture in 3 to 5 days, now I hadn't left the state and driving was going to take me over 2700 miles however wanted furniture delivered in a timely manner therefore said yes and was advised before they could deliver would need additional payment.   Paperwork was sent over and I replied with copies of driver license, front and back of credit card.   The representative from the company tried the card three times and said card is declined.   I went into my bank whom informed me that my CVV code is being entered incorrectly, I call accounting back to advise and sale is complete however not able to provide date of delivery.   While on the road receive call from accounting that they have a driver whom will be delivering furniture by Saturday no later than Tuesday and driver will contact; accounting called back and stated that driver will deliver on Tuesday of following week.  Driver called to confirm and asked about number of steps and was advised would check and took picture and stated 16.  On Tuesday, driver advised before he could start unloading he would need additional $75 dollars along with the remaining payment of $3700???.  Paid the $3700?? and $75 was dismissed due to $150 paid at time of pick up for stairs and the first 8 being free. About 1 hour into delivering furniture the foreman went on a lunch break for about 2 hours and three new guys whom we didn't know started bringing our furniture into our residence and was the original guy whom started unlatch his driveable truck and left the container to be unloaded by these guys whom did all if the lifting.   The guy returns and refuse to pay the guys and we are waiting to file a claim on broken glass pieces and two big ticket items</Text>

Professional, reliable and reasonably priced. We used them to move inherited furniture from my grandma to my new apartment in the city. Their professionals made their reach exactly on-time and transported all the stuff safely at the place. Thank You!!< /text>

<Text>I strongly believe that all of this was well planned, it makes perfect sense and is pretty smart if you think about it, Colonial Moving & Storage if a Broker so what they do is cold call you using information they obtain from U-Haul, Penske & Budget Rentals (we know this because those were the 1st three we called before talking with Colonial. So, they get your info, make contact and give you a price significantly lower than quoted by the moving companies. They then have you pay a deposit then sell you contract to another company, obviously they are all working together and know this. Calstate Moving & Storage, Hermes Moving and Storage& Cross-Country Movers in our case. Calstate then controls the contract and uses its other businesses as sort of buffers, if the other businesses get in trouble, fines or complained on they can always just Do Business As (DBA) with a new name. Now instead of having to complain on one company in one state your dealing with 4 (or more) companies in 2 different states.  Now it becomes difficult to file a complaint of a law suit.
Here is what we have done and are doing.

We contacted the Better Business Bureau who gave us an amazing amount of information and insight. We filed a complaint with them on Calstate Moving & Storage, Hermes Moving and Storage & Colonial Moving & Storage. We contacted & filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation in California, New Mexico & Florida. I contacted & filed a complaint with the Federal Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. We contacted and filed a complaint with the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Whistleblowers Association and the California State Attorney Generals Office. We contacted and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (who put our names on a list for a class action law suit) and Immigration Customs Enforcement. Every where we called to complain were very helpful and gave us insight into contacting another agency that might be able to help. We are also in the process of posting complaints to My Moving Reviews, BBB, Yelp, Google & Yahoo Reviews so that no on else ever gets scammed like us.

Their movers coordinated our move and were too responsive. They were polite as well as friendly. Completed in 3 hours without having a single scratch on single accessory. Unforgettable working experience.</Text>

<review>Avoid this company like the plague. My fiancé and I used them to move from San Diego to Lake Tahoe. They quoted us $2,500, when we asked if there were any additional fees that might potentially come up the sales representative, Joe Mercado, stated to rest assure that all fees were final and binding. At that point we stopped shopping around for movers. When the Cal State movers arrived to our home the day or lease ended to load the truck they refused take the furniture unless we agreed to pay them an additional $5,200. After they took advantage of our lease ending with no other alternatives, they stated that the furniture would only take 1 - 3 days to be delivered, the furniture did not arrive until 5 days later with many broken items. They also held on / extorted our furniture by refusing to take credit card anymore and the manager who went by the name of Auggie demanded cash or post office money order or else they would not deliver our property which consisted of birth certificates, furniture, medicine, etc.. In hindsight we should have done a police report during that time. At this point we now plan on bringing legal action against the company and reporting them to the governing authorities.< /review>< Pics>

These guys were professional and quick. They showed up with an extra guy that could have upset me because of the added cost but frankly, we needed the help and they worked with me on the price. We've since decided the next time we move, we'll contract them to help us pack, too not just move the boxes.<//text>

We moved from CA to TN on 05/31. I spoke with Joe for a quote and after calling a few places I decided to go with this company. This company provided the worst moving service that I have ever experienced! I went room by room and wrote down every item that we were moving and even included measurements on some items so there were no surprises with extra charges. In the end we had more boxes so I expected to pay around $500 more. When Hendrix (lead mover) did the inventory he said that we had double what was quoted and that we would be using a full truck rather than half a truck (the movers get your stuff with a 26ft moving truck and shuttle it to the semi). I informed him that I gave an incredibly detailed inventory and even provided measurements and his response was that the guys giving the estimate essentially don’t know what they’re doing. Hendrix also doesn’t like to be questioned and will get aggressive and talk over you when you’re trying to ask questions. When I pointed out that the biggest items was our bed and 3 piece sectional he stated that the sectional could not be on its side, could not be stacked, and could not have boxes placed on top of it and that’s the reason for the excess room beyond what was originally quoted. He also said with our elliptical that nothing could be placed on top of it. We were scheduled to leave that day so we agreed to pay the higher price. Hendrix also tried to say they were charging extra for “back breaking” items. The items he was referring to was a washer, a refrigerator, and our mattress. He wanted to charge an additional $600 for those items and they are regular standard sized items. We asked him to show where this was in the contract and he then removed the extra charge.Throughout the process of them loading I was in contact with Joe who kept texting me and saying what they are doing is unethical and they’re not loading stuff properly. After a couple of days I called dispatch and was told our stuff was still in CA and the date it was due to be loaded on the semi. When Melissa notified us that it was loaded I asked what the approximate date for arrival was and was told the driver would call and if I haven’t heard from the driver in a few days to reach out. Some days pass and I reach out to Melissa again who cannot be bothered to message back and this went on for a few days before she finally messages back. The driver contacts us via text and stated he’ll be there on 6/15 and stated anything more than 150lbs is an extra charge and that if they have to carry items more than 50 feet is also extra. I wrote back stating the contract mentions nothing of the 150lbs additional charge and that it’s 75ft not 50ft. He just messaged back..ok thanks. Our stuff arrives and they open the side door where they’re going to unload our stuff and I notice the semi trailer is not even 1/3rd full. The semi trailer used was 53 feet so if we had a 26ft moving truck full then our stuff should take up at least half the semi trailer and it was no where close to that. We also noticed stuff stacked on the elliptical, couches on their side and boxes on the couches (which Hendrix said couldn’t be done). My husband and I took numerous pictures and even measurements of the truck and calculated the actual square footage of the amount used in the semi. Hendrix said we used 1948 cubic feet when in reality it was 1196 so we were overcharged by $3948! I also asked the truck driver for the manifest showing how much space our stuff took up and he stated that he didn’t have a manifest. When I questioned him about the manifest and mentioned they’re required by law to carry one he backtracked and said...oh no it’s by weight so the driver had no desire to cooperate either. When I sent pics to Melissa and Joe demanding the overcharged amount back Melissa didn’t respond and Joe said he would pass the info along and I’d probably get a phone call. I have yet to receive any call so our next step is pursuing legal action. I would strongly discourage anyone from using this company as they have incredibly deceptive practices.<//Text>

Some people would lie just to make some money, this company teaches well. They can give away life values even for a cent.

I had to move from California to Maryland, so was talking to many and came across this moving company. The sales guy impressed me and I booked my move with them. He offered me a discount of $800 and 15 days guaranteed delivery, I was impressed and I signed the deal. I planned my relocation according to 15 days guaranteed delivery.

Bad things began on day of pick up.

First thing There was inventory mismatch, I took complete responsibility and paid extra.

Second problem, The pick up guy told me that discount was $600 not $800, I shared with them my signed copy. Then I got a call from lady called M**ssa , she was super rude and way too hard she told me that she can't offer me signed discount. I was at Maryland and my family was talking to pick-up guy, this company had my credit card details. I felt as I fell in trap with them with my wife alone dealing with them. She was in a forced situation to sign only $600 discount. So we decided to sign and move forward.

Third problem: Sales guy committed 2 weeks guaranteed delivery, but now he is not even taking my call. M**ssa the operation lady never has any status update. I'm still waiting to get answer of ETA but don't know to whom to talk. Worst experience of my life.

I would not recommend doing any business with them, rather I would advise people not to even talk to them on phone. Don't talk to guy called Shawn, he lies all the time. Don't talk to Melissa, she is not fit for customer handling job and is never aware about anything.< /text>

Their moving services are highly reliable and movers are dependable. Handled our move with efficacy and charged a reasonable price.< /Review>

The movers worked hard when you're there and it was a long day. However, they spent an extra 4-5 hours to meet us at the new address, 40 minutes away. We provided refreshing drinks and ordered pizza, specifically for them, during that time and they got there hours after the food was delivered (the movers were aware and had made special requests for the order).

When they finally got to our new house, they took a break to have the food (which was expected). However, when I went back the next day to clean our old place, there were crumbs and food remnants all over the kitchen from food they had apparently eaten there. We also found pizza crusts thrown in the bushes at our new house.

The movers admitted breaking one of our headboards (the supporting leg was completely snapped in half so there was no hiding it). It was only after they left and we are unpacking things that we noticed more damage. Our bar had damage to both the top and bottom of the wood. One of our desks had wood ripping from one side (the movers had conveniently left the desk resting on its side so we didn't see it at first). Boxes clearly marked "Fragile" were squished and we were lucky that only a few plates/cups were chipped.

One of the most disturbing things they did was snapping through the childproof locks on a desk inherited from my grandmother. They ripped the drawers so hard that the locks split the wood. There was no reason to open the drawers. They have ruined an heirloom.

We were foolish to tip the movers. We mistakenly believed they had been working the whole time. We believed them when they said the only damage was to the bedframe and gave them the benefit of the doubt.

We will never use good moving company again and will suggest our friends and family steer clear as well. In the future, I'll use one of the other two moving companies I've used that treated my things with care.</Review>

I hired these guys for a last minute move from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  They were recommended by a friend and they didn’t disappoint.

Their pricing was fair and they were responsive throughout the process.

My things arrived without a scratch and on time.

There were also no hidden fees after the move which was great.

Highly recommend.<//Review>

You've got to admit that moving is stressful. Then add on top of that the need to find movers and that you only hear BAD things about movers. It's enough to make you not trust anyone. BUT then you find a company like CalState Moving. They are honest (they didn't try to rip us off and lived up to their quote), professional (they take care of your stuff), and friendly (a smiling crew on moving day helps with the stress!). We have used them TWICE in the last few years (that right there says something). I'd recommend them to my family and friends any time. And so, I recommend them to you.</text>

<Text>Because I am in the military, I have to move a lot so I know exactly how stressful it can be. in the last 10 years, I have probably moved 5 times. Let me tell you, I have worked with lots of different moving companies but this one is by far the best. After my last move, I was so fed up with the company used that I almost decided to move myself. Then my friend recommended this company and thought I should give them a try.
They far exceeded my expectations and not only were they friendly and professional, they were extremely gentle with the furniture and boxes and did everything they could to make sure that the truck was packed as carefully as possible. They we're stacked and there was no open space so that they wouldn't move around as the truck was being driven. So when we arrived everything was still at the same place and in perfect condition which made unpacking super easy. Give them a call< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Loved the food! We had the crab cakes which were amazing! The avocado shrimp salad was incredibly filling and they didn't skimp on the shrimp. The clam chowder was delicious as well- so I heard. (I'm not a fan of clam chowder, but some folks are.) Would definitely come here again.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCeTBaLyuj6dEPI1_dCcovRk0nZz7jO_bAtcR_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeAqD2yz2_WtbxzuAsqA10jybRCjd74iJrzATB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Visited this place with my husband and son on a Friday night. The place wasn't that crowded, there were two other families seated. I should add that we went around 7:45 and I didn't realize the place closed at 8:30. We ordered a calamari appetizer and were served warm bread while waiting for our food to arrive. The bread was so good, I could have had a whole basket of that for dinner. It had a little crunch to it but was super soft and warm inside. Calamari was good as well. We ordered the "deep dish" pizza as our main entree. I understood that the deep dish took a little longer than a normal pizza would which was totally fine. It arrived and I was not as satisfied as I thought I would be. The crust on the bottom was pretty thin and it was mainly just a big glob of cheese, like, too much cheese. It became overbearing to the point it seemed as though we were just eating bug globs of cheese, not much filling in between that. I would visit again but probably steer away from the deep dish pizza.<//Text>

They offer a good mix of American foods and ethnic foods. They offer pizza that is  surprisingly good since they do not seem like a pizza parlor! I recommend their Chinese pizza, it is better than it sounds. Overall food quality here is slightly above average. It is a nice little diner to check out when going downtown. Also open on Easter! Big plus!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>We needed a place to grab a quick bite and we were amazed at how yummy everything was! The free breadsticks are warm, fresh and fluffy. I had the mushroom burger with steak fries, one of the tastiest burgers I have ever enjoyed and it was cooked perfectly. My husband ordered the Club Sandwich and in his words, "PERFECT! Exactly how I like it made, right amount of bacon, bread, turkey. Loved it!" And we ordered more onion rings because they were Ah-Mazing! We wish we lived closer, yet this place is now on our list of must got too in this area!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

The bacon was crushed and in the cheese,not ON tool as I've experienced at other places that serve a bacon cherseburgers. Kinda bland inside. Part cafeteria part restaurant settong. I was having an off day but will try something else on the menu. As for now I'm leaving my star rating as is.< /text>< Rating>

<Text>It had some of the most friendliest service I've ever had and the food was great! We got Hamburgers and they were delicious... we got served warm bread sticks with butter before our food came and our meals came with a free scoop of ice cream!! Pretty cool :)) It is clean and fast service (most important of all with kids)

Definitely going back to try the crab cakes and mussels since they are known for seafood 😜</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great service. The pizza was good. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but there was a lot of cheese on it, so that was a plus<//text>

<review>I have never been to a dentist to excels as highly at dentistry as they do with patient care. Dr. E is amazing, she is loving and kind, and phenomenal at what she does.  The entire staff is professional, welcoming and warm and they treat you like family. I went in yesterday, and walked out with a same day crown...it was so quick and flawless. I highly recommend giving them a chance, with yourself, your family and friends.  You will NOT be disappointed!!<//review>< name>

I had a broken tooth and needed a crown. I was able to get it the same day and the entire appointment was painless. Everything was explained to me.  The dentist was very good and her entire staff were kind and very professional. I highly recommend Rocklin Smiles.</Review>

Amazing and amazing! Everything from the staff to the doctors and the anesthesiologist! My little man who was only 3 yeard old had to have alot of dental work under anesthesia and boy did their expectations exceed. So kind, professional,  respectful,  gentle, and more. My son had the best recovery that I've never expected all due to the kind hands of the team.<//Review>

I had a bad experience at another dentist office not too far from this one, but I’m glad to say I’ve found my new home for my teeth needs here at Rocklin Smiles. The entire staff are all nice and amazing. Long story short my teeth have been a complete mess and everyone has been so caring and patient with me to get the problems resolved!< /text>

<Review>My experience at Rocklin Smiles has been wonderful. They created a treatment plan for me that was detailed, provided me with choices and was also affordable. Dr. JEANNINE EL-MAASRI has always been on time with my appointments, is the best dentist that I have ever been to. I love the staff. They make going to the dentist a good experience. Thank you all for an amazing job! I HIGHLY recommend this place.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>I've been coming here for almost 5 years now.  Even when I moved and it takes me an hour to drive here, I stayed.  Everyone here is super nice, professional, experienced, and excellent bedside manners.  This is the first dentist, where I've actually set appointments for particular persons (Holly, in my case).  Highly recommended!<//Review>< time>

Dr. El Maasri is wonderful.  She treated me with great care and made sure that I was comfortable for the entire experience.  The office is spotless clean, the staff is very friendly, and the technology they use is impressive (they made my permanent crown in the office while I waited).  An overall great place to have dental work done!</review>

My time at Rocklin Smiles was the best experience I've ever had at a dentist.  Jeannine is professional, clear, concise, focused and fluid as she works.  She has the capacity to teach and instruct while she's doing a procedure that releases confidence to the patient.  Confidence and security are key when undergoing any type of dental work and she delivers it so well.  Jeannine was more than I could have ever hoped for in a dentist.  She made it so relaxing and fun I didn't even feel like I was at the dentist.  She is extremely good at what she does and even better at being a friend in how she connects and relates to each patient.  What other dentists said they couldn't do for me, she took one look and said, "No biggy."  I'm very pleased with her service and I'm so happy to have switched over to her care.  She is the type of professional that people will continue to talk about and refer new business to because she's that different from the rest.   She's that rare. :D<//text>

If there were infinite and unlimited stars, that what they deserve.  I have been going to dentists for at least five decades.  I have been seen both Dr El Maasri and Dr Hopper for the last seven years.

Their competency and professionalism it top notch, there is no better.  The entire staff at Rocklin Smiles are principled, friendly and great at what they do – it is like you want to the dentist (I know, weird…).  They also have the most modern equipment which is so different than the more traditional approach (take it from an experienced patient!).

Yesterday Dr Massri and Star had me in the chair for almost four hours as I need three crowns (sigh).  It was done perfectly, no discomfort, great company and very reasonable prices.

We are fortunate to have them in our area.  These are good people and competent dental professionals.  Kudos to them (and I look forward to returning!)< /review>

I had a molar extracted this morning and it was PAINLESS and QUICK! I absolutely enjoyed Dr. Maasri's relaxed demeanor during the extraction. When you can hum "Tennessee Whiskey" while extracting a molar from a 340 pound patient and inspire the patient to hum along, you've got skills.  Her assistant, Amar, was on-point during the entire process. Nikki's 25 years of dental hygienic experience was evident during the exam and cleaning stage of my visit. Susie in billing, ended my visit with a very clear and concise explanation of costs and procedural plans that were available for me to choose from. From the moment I walked in and was greeted by Kayla up to the completion of my visit, the overall feeling in this office was one of family. I absolutely recommend this practice to anyone in need of professional and compassionate dental needs.</review>

Everyone is always extremely polite. When it comes to dentistry and getting any tooth work done they are extremely courteous and patient, always ensuring that the patient is not feeling any pain. All my prior dentistry experience was with the Navy, where the patient is a training tool for the hygienist.< /text>

The good part of Rocklin Smiles is the pleasant and friendly atmosphere inside the building. Everyone is going out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The two stars however are an evaluation prompted by the actual work and its consequences. I went in just for a checkup with no pain or issues.  Dr Maasri stated that she detected a cavity and that the best solution would be a crown. We proceeded with the procedure but I was somewhat uneasy by the process; most of the actual crown work was done by an assistant (technician) and the post bite adjustment took maybe 5 minutes.  Dr. Maasri told me that I could come back for any issue. The pain over the next days was pretty substantial and grew to chronic pain into my lower and upper jaw reaching my cheekbone. When I started waking up at nights, I made a new appointment. During the second appointment new adjustment to my bite were done but again pain drove me to take ibuprofen for pain reduction and possible inflammation. After my third visit the bite was finally corrected as it should be and now I am pain free.
Again, the office is trying to be super friendly but the actual dentist work seems to be rushed in completion. My days and nights of pain could have been prevented by an extra 15-30 minutes of bite correction; it seems the dentist did not have the needed experience to identify and complete the bite correction properly.< /Review>

Kind and friendly, always welcoming me with a bottle of water in the beginning and a warm towel in the end of the appointment. I highly recommend Rocklin Smiles !!!<//Text>

I went to a single dentist from the time I was 4-17 years old, went to another from 17-22. I stopped going because every cavity filling or cleaning meant pain and staff that didn’t listen or recognize when I was in pain. Now at 32 I took a chance based off of reviews, referrals, and testimonials. I will say this is the BEST experiences I have ever had. I don’t fear the dentist anymore and scheduling is a breeze. I live 55 minutes away and will happily take that drive to be in the hands of such nice and professional individuals. I cannot thank them enough for finding my smile again. 😊😊<//review>

Great experience! How many times can you say that about a visit to the dentist? Very friendly and welcoming staff, and Nikki provided outstanding cleaning and advice, as well as being a kind and friendly person. Dr. Hopper and Dr. Masri have given me great dental care,  I highly recommend this practice!</Review>

I absolutley loved the staff here. Dr El-Maasri has such a compassionate nature about her  that immediately put me at ease. The assistant Amar was so welcoming and very thorough making sure I understood everything and explained everything to the Dr and hygenist so i didnt have to repeat myself over and over. Holly the hygenist is so sweet and funny she kept me laughing even when she had to cause pain. Susie and Treasure from the front desk were great as well Treasure jumped in to help the hygenist chart so it could go faster. Susie made sure I understood the upcoming work needed and all my treatment and finance options. Truly a great team and I actually look forward to my next visit when I am always leery of going to the dentist.< /review>

< Review>
Highly recommended!! I can't even describe the level of fear I have for the dentist, and as a result, avoided them for years. Due to a recent painful tooth issue, I dragged myself - terrified - to Rocklin Smiles. I can't believe that I am saying that it was actually a great experience! Dr Hopper is kind, understanding, and does everything to provide a comfortable and less stressful experience. The dental assistant, Heather, was the BEST too - again, comforting, and understanding. Procedures were explained in detail and decisions were left up to me (i.e. no pressure). I do plan to go back regularly, since I feel such trust with the professionals at Rocklin Smiles.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>New to California??? I just moved out here from the mid-west and I now know the reasons why this office was recommended to me. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted promptly, with a smile and made to feel important. The doctors made it easy to understand what needed to be done and how we needed to approach the steps to creating my better smile. I've finished my first phase of work and eagerly anticipate more to come in the future. From both doctors El-Maasri and Hopper, assistants and clerical staff, they all acted as true professionals and were as personable as life-long friends. The whole experience gave me the feel of being at my home town office and I will definitely be back.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Very pleasant and personable staff every time I visit. If you are the kind of person who doesn’t like going to the dentist this is the place for you! I can see that all staff members go the extra mile in assuring that you are comfortable and satisfied during your entire visit. I am treated by Dr El Maasari and couldn’t be happier. She always greets me with a beautiful smile, makes me feel like family and always has the time to answer all of my questions. You should make the switch today, like now, call them and schedule your next appointment. Go go go! Lol</Review>< Pics>

<text>Biannual teeth cleaning with Nikki is always a pleasant experience.  As an extremely fearful dental patient, since moving to the area two years ago and starting with them I have had nothing but good things to say.  I love that crowns are made on site so there is no need for a temporary and I also am very grateful for the option of sedation dentistry.  The office staff are always friendly and professional.  Honestly cannot say enough good things about this practice. Feeling comfortable about dental appointments is a huge part of the battle for me and I no longer find myself rescheduling further out and delaying my visits.  Thank you Rocklin Smiles!</text>< Date>

UPDATE July 16,2019
Implant finished up and as usual the staff Dr. Al-Massari and staff were ultra-professional and there aren’t enough superlative‘s to explain the experience.

I have been going to Rocklin smiles for over 15 yrs- I saw Dr Hopper for years and had an incredible experience- He was always very sure to make sure I was comfortable and very satisfied with my dental work- Great Dds.  When his schedule changed, it worked better for me to start seeing Dr ElMasari.  I can't say enough good things about her - she is thoughtful, informative, caring, professional, personable, attentive to your comfort, satisfaction, and concerns.  She is dedicated to your 100% satisfaction with any dental work.  I have always been super impressed with both dds, and the level of care. Both are everything you are looking for in a dds and I HIGHLY Recommend them to anyone.  They do denstistry the way it should be- with your comfort, concerns and satisfaction at the top of their priorities!  👍👌🏼😁</Text>

<review>You could not find a better dentist than Dr. El-Maasri, or a better dental office than Rocklin Smiles! Their service and care is exceptional; I have been in for cleanings, fillings, whitening, and a crown, and each experience has been easy and problem-free. Dr. El-Maasri always takes the time to answer questions and fully explain things to me, and her compassionate nature and skill make me feel at ease; she even calls me after I've had a procedure to make sure I am doing okay! The assistants also continually go above and beyond to make sure I am taken well care of and am comfortable,  and the front office staff is always welcoming and helpful. I have recommended this office to my family and friends and will continue to do so!</review><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809b1f6f2083bd57:0x3434965385e2f62<//gmap_id><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

I have been with Rocklin Smiles for 20 years and have been so happy with all the dental care myself and family have received there. In 2017 I decided to go with invisalign and just finished the treatment today. THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I HAVE EVER MADE. Working with Dr. EL-Masseri was just a delightful experience! She is extremely knowledgeable and very thorough. At first I was not sure Invisalign was the right decision for me,  Dr. El-Masseri was very understanding and did not push me. She went over the pros and cons, and in the end I decided to go with the treatment. Early on in the treatment, I was adjusting to the process and discussed options with Dr. El-Masseri that worked for me. She was very attentive to my requests and helped me get through the adjustment period. Thank you toDr. Hopper and  Dr. El-Masseri and the awesome...AWESOME!!! staff at Rocklin Smiles! My family is so lucky to have been in your care for the past 20 yrs.</Review>

I have been a patient of many different dentists over the years, but Dr El-Maasri  (& Dr Hopper) are the BEST I've had the pleasure to be a patient of!!  The majority of the time I am seen by Dr El-Maasri. She is always a pleasure to be around & makes every visit as relaxing & comfortable as can be. Her knowledge & care are 2nd to none!!

Dr El-Maasri makes sure I am pain-free & comfortable throughout the procedure.  She fully explains the procedure beforehand & is always willing to answer any questions and/or clarify anything throughout the process. Her follow-up care is top notch.  If there is any concerns, she makes herself available to address them,  as well as simply ensuring you are doing well.  She mashes it her priority that you receive not only the best care, but only the care & procedures necessary.

I would & do recommend Dr El-Maasri & Dr Hopper for all your & your families dental care, without reservation!!!< /Text>

This dental office is amazing! The dentists are very kind and explain everything to you in detail and they don’t try tricking you into doing more then you need. The dental assistants are all very nice. The work I had done to my teeth was painless and quick. I never felt uncomfortable the entire time. I like this place a lot and will be referring my family and friends.< /Text>

I highly recommend them.</review>

I have been coming to pearl dentistry for 3 years now.
What makes this place amazing is the support staff. They are always friendly and they treat you with such respect.
I get very nervous when I have to get numbed for dental procedures. Lena (one of the dental hygienist) always make me feel so at eaze. She talks to me through the whole process and is just so nice to me. She never judges me or makes me feel bad for when I start to freak out a little.
I mainly go here for the support staff, they are incredible!!!<//text>

<Review>I highly recommend Pearl Dental Care. Dr. Changela and his staff are so nice and very attentive. Feb 2021 I was in desperate need of dental assistance so I did a Google search of "emergency dentists near me" and this was the first place on the list. I was kind of hesitant to call because of the location, but I'm beyond glad I did and I couldn't be happier. I called on a Monday and they got me in the same day. We did all the Xrays and the oral observation then Dr. Changela explained my options to me thoroughly. I decided having my tooth pulled was the best option and he had me come in the next day. I get really nervous being in "the chair" lol and sure enough I had a panic attack. They were so nice and offered me some water, gave me a little oxygen and just talked me through it til I could calm down. I appreciated that very much.< /Review><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Low Key</Name><time>1614826998347<//time><GmapID>0x80c32e9b4cc4f72d:0x7351e744e2307e03</GmapID><rating>5<//rating>< user_id>

Stay away! This place steals from people. I had to file a grievance through my insurance company when I found out the work they had done was 100% covered through my insurance. This was after they charged $250 for two filings. 2 filings! Save your time and money, go somewhere else where you will be treated fairly and not be ripped off. I got a refund, and my insurance was never even contacted by them until I had reported this. The Dr. himself said that's what it cost through my insurance. Scam artists at best. What's horrible is that they did decent work, but I can never trust them again. So, off to find a better dentist. Just stay away and save yourself the hassle.</review>

< Review>
First off let me start off saying that I'm scared of going to the dentist.Growing up, I just had bad experiences but  Pearl Dental care is the  Best Place to ever get any dental work done!!! By far one of the coolest Dental offices I've ever been to!! The staff greet you and treat you with respect and they are really friendly and just caring people.  I have seen both Dr Patel and Dr Changela during various dental visits in past and  both of these guys are really amazing Dentists.They explain everything before doing anything to you! They show you what they are talking about and really cares for their patients. They really make you feel like you are in good hands and make you feel comfortable.  You can tell right away that they are really professional. My family is so happy here that we now found our permanent family Dentists. I would recommend  Pearl Family Dental to everyone!!! Two thumps up guys!!<//Review>

<Review>I was in extreme pain and needed an emergency tooth extraction. I went to their  websiteand set  up an appointment and within 30 minutes Dr Changela personally contacted me. Once I arrived and got checked in. I noticed how comfortable and right at home everyone makes you feel. He as well as the rest of the staff are very sweet and attentive. He took care of my problem with such care. Im very appreciative of his work. Thank you again!

I highly recommend this place!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c32e9b4cc4f72d:0x7351e744e2307e03<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been coming to this dentist for years and I have never had a better experience. Every other dentist tried to scam me to get things I did not need. Dr. Patel has always been so great and making sure I am taken care of and only takes care of things that are necessary. My family loves how nice all the staff and Dr. Patel is and we all will continue to come here.< /Review>

<text>My husband Michael Ibrahim has been a patient of Dr. Changela for a few years.  He has had dental work and eight implants by him.  His work was excellent.  He is knowledgeable and and up to date on the latest technologies and innovations on his field.  He is surrounded by competent assistants and friendly administrative staff. My husband highly recommends this caring group for all your dental work needs.< /text></record>

<user_name>megan howell<//user_name><Review>I wish I could do a negative star rating. This place ruined my teeth. Any work I had done was counter productive because I had to pay to have another dentist fix the teeth they worked on. Any cavity they had filled for me was done improperly and is now leaking and I will need to get them redone because they are causing more cavities. This place will only cost you more money, I highly advise you stay away. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Staff is very friendly! I've been going there for about 10 years now. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family. Everyone is very professional and the location is always clean. The dentist are all experienced and well skilled. Maria at the front desk is great at calling and reminding me of my appointments. Diana always does an amazing job and is extremely gentle when she does my teeth cleaning. If your looking for a dental office this is the location to go to!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>If you do not want to be overcharged or taken advantage of Read my story below as i know it is a bit long. This Dentist office swore to the amount we were being charged for work we had done "they lied". if you had work done there and feel like you were over charged "look into to it with your insurance, as on paper it looked legit but i felt in my gutt it was not what we should of been charged.

SO 2 Yrs ago myself and husband had work done and the dentist gave us a price which was pretty high but as a good dentist does he brought it down to only $800 , $400 for each of us for cleaning and some type of medication, not to mention we both have insurance. We weren't totally happy but the dentist said we needed the work he was doing, i questioned  it but my husband wanted us to get this work done, nothing else was done, no caps, no pulling, absolutely nothing oh maybe x-rays. So i called our  insurance and they spoke wtih me, i let it go.  So this yr. i end up with pain and call the dentist office to come in and he quotes me over $1200 and then starts the whole negotiating thing and finally for the extraction (1 tooth) i get a $280-$320 quote, medication prescription of amoxicillin and come back in about 4 days for extraction. I was so uncomfortable and called my insurance to investigate as i was looking over my co pay booklet for extraction and other things and it said $0 cost. i called the insurance comp. and went over the work that was done 2 years ago and they said we absolutely should not have paid more then $30 for copay each. i filed a grievance with our insurance company (on line) "Delta Dental HMO" and they emailed me and said they were going to look into it and request all work and charges, as i told them the girls in the office said the dentist do their own billing. and when i ask for copies of the itemized work and cost the girl i spoke with was a bit hostile with the fact they had already been contacted by the insurance and said there was no way we were over charged. A few weeks later we received a letter stating that we were absolutely 100% over charged by $740 which should be reimbursed within 30 days and if not to immediately contact them. The one thing i wanted PEARL DENTAL customers to know is to being very careful and file a grievance with your insurance if you feel you have wrongly been charged . I immediately changed our dentist to West Coast Dental that did the extraction for free no cost no questions no pushing for more work to be done. We did get our money back , wish i had addressed the issue sooner and knew about filing a grievance back then but non the less the money came back to its rightful owners, we work hard for our money and we should not be blindly robbed by any doctor dentist or profession business that claims to want to keep us healthy. never will i recommend this dentist office to anyone.
West Coast Dental is profession inside and out and a nice place. Call them transfer as they take all insurance.</text>< Response>

<Text>OK, let me start by saying that in the beginning things were nice until this Dentist who's name starts with a "B" was unclean did not wash his hands. Every health care provider needs to  wash hands before gloves! I always had to remind him. This guy was horrible when it came to pulling out one of my teeth. He also did a crown that is too big for my my other teeth and it shows on the x-ray I got at another dentist location. It is somewhat open ( hard to explain.) As for all the so called " good" comments about this guy all I have to say is ha ha ha LOL why did I not get that type of care? The payment was always paid financially so what was the problem? I NO longer go to this dentist, time has passed on. What he did to me still has stayed in my memory. I also had issues with some of the other people who worked there (not all of them, but some) cuse they had issues with me for no reason. That is NO way to treat a paying costumer. ALL should be treated equal no matter what. Currently, If any other dentist hurts me again this time I will file a complaint  to the dental board! With this guy I was just too nice to do anything.<//Text><user>103014466604779683594< /user><name>Andy Soern</name></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been coming to Pearl Dental for years. Dr Changela and his team are kind, friendly, and gentle. They address all our concerns and keep us well informed if we need any additonal dental work. They provide excellent dental care for myself, my husband and our four children (ages 4 to 12). It's difficult treating a toddler however Dr Changela and his team are so gentle and patient with all our children. We truly appreciate the excellent care they provide and would highly recommend this office to anyone seeking a professional, honest and friendly dental office. Thank you Pearl Dental for treating us like family!<//review>< pics>

I started my dental work at Pearl Dental Care in Dec of 2014. The following work from start to finish required about 50 visits in 18 consecutive months. At beginning was necessary to remove two old bridges and extract multiple teeth to create space for implants to support the future set of new upper and lower partial dentures.  For dental cosmetics at first I received a 3 unit bridge at upper center region. The bridge fitted perfectly at very first fitting and color of the porcelain crown matched exactly color of my natural healthy teeth.  It is important mentioned that for all appointments the average time in the waiting room from signing in and getting into dental chair never exceeded more than 10 min. The dental office is furnished with state of the art equipment. The office area and all equipment were always clean and maintain high level of sterol hygiene environment.  For new dental implants in the upper jaw area was necessary to repair the bon loss by performing a bone graft (Sinus Lift Procedure) on the right and left hand side of the jaw bone structure. The procedure was performed at Pearl Dental Care office by oral surgeon Dr. Tarun Patel. Both surgeries were performed flawlessly and without any postoperative complications. After complete Bone Graft Recovery I received 4 dental implants in the upper jaw. After implants successfully integrated with the surrounding bone the dental implants were completed and new partial dentures fitted very well.  Dr. Bhavin Changela demonstrated very high skill not only in general dentistry but also a high knowledge and experience in area of dental implants.  Pearl Dental Care is great dental office.  Very professional staff and hip and clean environment.  Highly recommend this dental office.</Text>

My name is Sami and I have been going to Pearl Dental Care for about 3 years now. Clean clinic and very professional and friendly staff.

Dr. Bhavin Changela is extremely informative and will always be happy to answer all of your questions. Dr. Bhavin Changela is very courteous and smooth with his work. He will take the time to educate you prior to performing any work being done and he is very patient.

I am extremely satisfied with the service and professionalism I receive at Pearl Dental Care and will always go back.

Today I was at Pearl Dental Care because I had a stubborn discoloration on my front center tooth and was worried because I thought it was a cavity and it would not come off even with very rough brushing and flossing. We got a scan done and then Dr. Bhavin Changela asked me some questions to help analyze the cause of the discoloration.

After the Dr. Figured it out, he let me know and proceeded with cleaning. Sure enough it worked and I am back to having a nice white smile.

Best part, Pearl Dental Care didn't charge me since it was such a minor fix and I have been a loyal customer.

Thank you Dr. Bhavin Changela And Pearl Dental Care!

- Very satisfied customer, Sami</text>

Cupcakin never misses. Every flavor is delicious with a fluffy bread, glazed top, and not-too-sweet cream. My favorites are Snickerdoodle and lemon cream pie—which has a graham cracker pie crust bottom to die for.</review>

< review>
King Pin Donuts used to be the best in Berkeley since Wayne's Donuts closed years ago. During  the past 6 months or so, something changed. I don't know if there is a new owner, or if the man (who was so nice & an expert donut maker) who made the donuts is no longer there, but the donuts are huge and horrible. They made the donuts huge and jacked up the price, effectively making the customer buy what should be two donuts, but instead is one horrible tasting huge donut. They are not fried long enough so they are gummy, while others are dry. Even the glazes are bad now. Maple tastes like cinnamon, not maple. They also seem stale now. Well I gave the benefit of the doubt and went 3 more times before this last time. I am done and will not go back, unless they switch back to the original recipes and doughnuts.<//review>

Very good cupcakes. Its a 3.75 out of 5. They where creative with a gram crust at bottom of cupcake and the cake was moist but the key lime taste was faint. Also each cupcake was almost $4.<//text>

<text>Hands down my favorite cupcakes. Huge fan of the Key Lime & Lemon cupcakes. They always have a vegan & a gluten-free flavor available,  which are equally tasty as the other cupcakes. Makes birthday/office parties much easier... everyone will be happy.< /text><user_name>melissa brown<//user_name><Rating>5<//Rating><resp>None< /resp></record>

I just wanted to inform fellow customers of their own safety and health. I came here a few days ago to grab a dozen cupcakes for my Mother’s birthday. As I was waiting in line there were two people in front of me without a mask. I tried to keep a distance away from them and hoped that the employees would ask them to wear a mask. By law, everyone is required to wear a mask when entering businesses and even in general. However, the employee proceeded to serve them and continued to have a small conversation with the customers about the flavors they offered. By then, I was furious at how the store was not taking correct precautions, especially when we are in a pandemic. With cases rising, I wanted to support local small businesses as I love their key lime pie cupcakes and their salted caramel cupcakes. However, I do not think I will be coming back here for a while. The employee also used the same gloves to wipe down a counter with a dirty towel, and proceeded to serve another customer. Lastly, I also noticed a person coming from out back to talk to their employee without a mask on. (Possibly a manager)? The environment itself at this store seems to be hazardous, not only to the customers, but possibly to their employees as well. As a nurse, I do not accept this type of carelessness in the food industry during a pandemic.<//text>

Every single flavor I tried from "Cupcakin" has been the best flavor of cupcake I've every had. I tried the Vegan Chocolate Raspberry, Cookies n Cream and Vanilla Salted Caramel.  The cupcakes were so good I went and got a 4th one after my errand, I got a second Vanilla Salted Caramel. The lady at the counter was very nice both visits.
These cupcakes are super moist but flavorable. I could go on and on about how the flavor notes in each flavor were little moments of bliss. The texture was perfect. My only complaint is that the wrapper took some of the bottom cake so I just scrapped it off thw wrapper to savor every moment.< /review>

<text>Go to CupCakin Bake Shop stand in front of the counter, close your eyes, point at one of the cupcakes on display randomly and try it. They will be fresh, moist,  delicious and amazing.
Key lime, Caramel mocha are one of the best. If you like cupcakes you will love them here, if you love cupcakes this is how cupcakes in heaven tastes like.. The staff are always friendly and smiling and good service. if you taste one you will keep going back to taste them all and you wont stop....<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKw9Hx3MiamjYldoyrHlETB7bNluXpsvwgfKPK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The staff is always friendly and smiling, and their cupcakes are sure to put a smile on you! We got the salted caramel, chocolate chip cookie, and red velvet cupcakes. The red velvet is their most popular (and my personal favorite). The cake is super moist and fluffy, while the cream/icing is decadent and light to the pallette without being overpowering.

This place is perfect for treating your team or coworkers (or just yourself 🤗) to something sweet and delicious!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXDKT36E_V4wRO_7nHDBOLAh6Kr8sFcCOAVNdC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<review>I live out of state and have now ordered from Cupcakin Bake Shop via ubereats twice for friends in the bay for their birthdays. I've had some questions so I called the shop both times, and they were super friendly and very helpful. Unfortunately for me, I have yet to be able to eat any of the cupcakes myself, but my friends have raved about them! Thanks Cupcakin Bake Shop!!<//review>< Resp>

These cupcakes-got some for the first time today! And let me tell you they were splendid. I got the lemon, vegan chocolate, and berries I haven’t hummed and danced while eating food in a long time.

Thank you</Review>

I bought a dozen mini cupcakes for a small birthday gathering. They were delicious, but service was not perfect - I asked employee which mini cupcake flavors they had, and she just pointed to them. I had to pull out information from her — what is that pink one? What about the one with the white frosting? It would have been nice if she had identified them for me instead of me having to ask her what each one was. So 4 stars for the cupcakes and 2 stars for service.< /Text>

These cupcakes makes me soooo very happy!! They are absolutely incredible! I have been coming to Cupcakins for a couple of years and have thoroughly enjoyed every visit!! Zero complaints about this business! Kudos to the talented African American business owner!! I live in Santa Rosa, and yes I gladly travel to Berkeley for these cupcakes!! Thank you so much for the different and innovative varieties! It keeps me coming back for more!! I have shared this gem with my church members and now several of us travel down not only to experience the delicious cupcakes but also to support! The ladies who work there are always sweet and kind!! Keep your head up, and continue to be great at what you do!!!<//Text>

Customer service I give it a 2 stars girls look "thrilled" to be there, very un enthusiastic even bothered for serving the customer or answering questions. I enjoy sweet foods but these little cupcakes pack a major punch in the sugar department... Could not eat it, my teeth hurt... Cut down on the sugar by half maybe?

Good location for students, I'm not a student.

Alyssa prepared a 2-tier semi-naked cake for our wedding. She was organized, polite and delivered the cake on time. All the guests actually stopped by our table to complement the cake (and it was an older picky crowd). Extremely pleased.</Review>

Great tasting cupcakes, a little bit on the expensive side of things but overall they're worth it once in a while. My favorite is the key lime flavor but I've tasted almost all the flavor and they're all very good. Definitely worth a try as a little dessert.< /text>

I was at this store three weeks ago. I made my purchase and when it was time for me to pay, I thought I’d be paying the regular way where you either slide your card or insert the chip if it has one and then your PIN number to process the payment. Well, this was NOT the case. The lady who identified herself as the manager of the store asked for my card and proceeded to enter my card details manually. Everything including the CVV at the back of my card. I’ve never felt so exposed! This lady did not even give me a heads up or at least ask me if I was comfortable with her processing my payment in that manner. I got paranoid & asked whether it was safe for her to process my payment in that manner. She caught an attitude and then responded saying that she did not memorize my card number and that she was the manager if I was so worried about it. How is you being the manager supposed to help the situation at hand exactly? I don’t know you so I don’t trust you regardless of the position you hold! And I quite honestly don’t care, you’re a human being at the end of the day. I don’t know what else you are besides being a manager. Additionally, you being the manager doesn’t give you the right to my card details! Plain & simple! Nothing gives you the right to invade my privacy the way you did! How disgusting of you, to carry such entitlement! A customer’s card details are private and this should go without saying. And there’s a reason why businesses use card readers as opposed to putting in every client’s card details manually. Who even does that? Without giving their customers a heads up? Better still what kind of business manager catches an attitude and gets upset when a customer expresses concern when it comes to their privacy? How unprofessional and uncouth of you! Yes, you want to keep the money coming into your business, it’s obvious, but violating a customer’s privacy in that manner and being arrogant & dismissive about it is NOT the way to go about it! You’ll lose more than you ever wanted to gain to begin with. First of all be honest and upfront with your customers if your card reader is NOT WORKING and LET THEM KNOW BEFORE THEY MAKE A PURCHASE THAT YOU WILL BE PROCESSING THEIR PAYMENT BY ENTERING THEIR CARD DETAILS MANUALLY. Simple ethics! What this manager did was so UNETHICAL! And the fact that she had the nerve to catch an attitude made everything worse!
Your customer’s loyalty is one of the most important things you could ever earn as a business! Learn that! My privacy was violated by the manager of this store that day I decided to make a purchase. And as if that wasn’t enough, she caught an attitude when I expressed my concern and then trivialized it like it was nothing! And that one reason, this bakery is never getting another dime of my hard earned money ever again.<//text>

<text>This place don’t know if they open or close. Don’t drive from far away you may get to the door and they close.  Not a dependable business. I went today at 2pm it was closed. When I called the owner said she was closed for lunch for 2hours. Great cupcakes just the wrong owner and operator. Not a professional business hours not consistent. Went another time suppose to be open till 6pm closed at 5pm wasted trip again.<//text>< Pics>

I've been stalking this shop on social media and finally decided to drop in... boooy if I could kick myself for not going sooner.  I bought the salted caramel, strawberry chocolate, lemon pie and raspberry chocolate cupcakes. All were amazing. The Lemon and Raspberry were definitely my FAVORITE. I'll be going back soon.</text>

<date>1560555712210< /date><Review>I'm giving all stars because they are amazing cupcakes. But We drive 45 mins to come this way, just for them to never have any cupcakes! Like seriously,  You advertise a closing time of 9:00 p.m. but yet at 4 o'clock when you're basically out of cupcakes you don't remake any new ones? It's really frustrating especially when we drive so far just to come to this business and this has happened to us 3 times! I probably would have came in and spent over 50$ on cupcakes for our family and our friend's today. I don't know if we will even come again.   But I guess if you can make it to the shop at opening time or maybe noon time they are sooooo worth it!!<//Review><userid>105894512311126721137<//userid>< pics>

Ordered a double chocolate muffin.  I arrived late and they were running out of options, but I was not disappointed. Really soft, tasty but not too heavy or dry as often happens with double chocolate. If you ask, they would pack it una beautiful bag, ideal for a small gift.< /Text>

I really went to Swan Market to grab a savory lunch meal, but that's the  best part about a market - there are endless, tempting food options!  Of course being the dessert lover that I am, I initially was eyeing the chocolate chip cookies at Cosecho.  Then all of a sudden my homegirl said, "Oh you're looking in the wrong direction if you want that good good!" And I turned my attention to my beloved Cupcakin' Bake Shop!

What do I love about Cupcakin' you ask?
-Offers a nice assortment of cupcake flavors as well as sizes (get a regular size & a mini so you can try 2 flavors and not feel like your overdoing it!)
-The bright décor is very inviting
-The staff is super friendly
-The cupcakes are DELICIOUS (icing is sweet, cake is moist, and it is everything your taste buds need)!

The Chocolate Salted Caramel was divine and the surprise of the salt at the bottom of the cupcake...oooh wee!  The Red Velvet delivered as well.  Cupcakes are priced well too - minis are $1.95 & regular size are $3.75.

This place prides itself on being local (owner is an Oakland native), artisan, and it is a black owned business.  And if you're in the BeyHive, you'll be elated because Beyoncé music was in heavy rotation.

Can't wait to return.  My sweet tooth wants more!< /review>

A M A Z I N G ! The cupcakes are so yummy, the cupcaker(? lol) is so so nice and I would come back again and again. They're moist, fluffy not too sweet, even the frosting isn't too much and it's such a gorgeous presentation. I believe the price is beyond worth it for what you get and I recommend highly and will be back. Perfect gift (:<//Review>

Is it legal to only take a credit card for a minimum amount ($6.50)? At any rate, my purchase was not for the minimum, so I added another cupcake, but that only made my purchase come to $6.33, and she still refused my credit card since I was .17 short of the minimum. The cupcakes looked good, but I walked out after being refused to use my card.  Sorry, that is not good business!<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I had such high expectations based on the previous reviews. I'm really sad that the gluten candy apple was just okay and the vegan chocolate was awful!  The gluten free cupcake's icing was really nice, so even if the cupcake was mediocre, it worked. However the vegan chocolate didnt smell good and tasted identical to the taste. Maybe the icing batch wasnt fully mixed or maybe it was a bad batch in general, but it had almost a metallic and/or chemical scent and taste. Please check your batches or have a taste tester. If I hadn't traveled so far, I would have brought them back for you to assess.</Text>< pics>

I absolutely love these gems called cupcakes!!! I'm a baker myself and have a hard time finding treasures in bake shops BUT that's not the case with Cupcakin bake shop. I haven't met a flavor I didn't like!!!! I brought a couple dozens in to work. ....... Let's just say they are believers Lol everybody wanted to know where I got them from. I highly recommend this place. Yummmmmmm<//review>

<Text>Amazing bread and baked goods. The owner does an amazing job, and is really nice to all of her customers.  They don’t really focus on coffee drinks, but their bread in particular is some of the best anywhere.  Very strong competition for the also excellent Some Crust.<//Text><user_id>101890733324319847124< /user_id><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvGzx3nPHzTF2sS-MFtunYgwuLjx2_N88SVNTr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrkZ87Hpaf7ddaTUhw7ULcxv3Hq-I1p9ahDd2P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record>

<review>Don’t be fooled by the negative paid-for reviews. If you enjoy patisserie, this is the best. It’s difficult to leave without one of everything. From the jalapeño cheddar biscuits to the croissants, sandwiches, and breads. It’s all delicious!!< /review>< Response>

< review>
So here is the thing. I have to be blatantly honest. This bakery has a case full of what "appear" to be beautifully baked goods, in a cute shop, in charming downtown Claremont. So what's the problem?  Looks are very deceiving. The pastries were so beautiful we couldn't wait to get home and brew a cup of coffee and try each one.  To our massive disappointment, none were good. We mean, none.  At best, the almond croissant gets 3 of 5. I am still baffled at how pretty the baked goods compared to tasting so bland.  A total of 5 adult and teen tasters, who couldn't approve of even one pastry.

The fruit tart crust to custard ratio must be improved. Frankly, it was like eating a thick piece of crust with a few pieces of fresh fruit. Just meh.

The fruit, cheese, and almond Danish pictured are just blah....  and we mean blah...

We also purchased a loaf of sourdough bread (not pictured), that was a bit stale and also lacked in flavor. $35 wasted as we threw out the baked goods.

By far, we much rather go to Some Crust Bakery.  In a blind taste test, Creme Bakery would lose to Ralph's bakery.  Too bad 👎.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Heavenly was the term the fellow next to me used to describe the fresh bread. Creme Bakery is my newest treat to start off these cool December mornings... I always try the basics first. The buttermilk biscuit was excellent with a little bit of crispy sweet on the outside and a little more dense than the average biscuit. The chocolate croissant was amazing. Crispy, flaky and the chocolate was gone sooner than I had wished. This week was a blueberry muffin which is almost a meal in itself and a ham sandwich. When I think of a ham sandwich, I hardly ever think of anything special. But each layer of this one stood out. The ham was excellent, the type of cheese picked was also a great match. And the baguette! Mega crunch on the outside but soft and chewy to make a perfect match with the ham and cheese. Bravo!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoIIe9y01mjD73iM7ELdDE8sc2EUtcbdGiXkJ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG7OJnjHbeEJOsVV7ArBNGg9YyIHHXa8JX_qVl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

My only grief is that I don't live close enough to make this a part of my daily routine! Beautiful assortment of tasty pastries, you can pick standards like chocolate croissants or venture into less common options like the ginger scones.<//text>

This place is amazing. It's the closest I have found to the better bakeries I found while visiting France. The customer service is wonderful. My only complaint is that the line can be long in the morning because so many people love this place. Great croissants, scones, fresh bread, baguettes, lunch sandwiches similar to what you find in France, and decent coffee. Whatever your favorite item you might find in a French bakery, you will find at Crème!<//review>

<Review>This bakery in Claremont is a special, unique place.  The space is inviting and the staff is attentive and welcoming.  Their handmade breads, pastries, pies, cakes, and sandwiches are made fresh each morning.  We have sampled almost everything here and it’s all wonderful— truly first class!  We’ve had several items, e.g. cakes and pies, for special occasions and everyone raves about them!  We fell in love with this bakery and we’re certain you will too.<//Review>< UserId.>

This boutique French bakery is located in Old Town Claremont and is usually busy especially on weekends and you cannot miss it because of the lines that stretches outside. You find most of the usual French pastries you’ll find in other French bakeries, but the way they present it here makes the difference and the fact that you’re in Old Town adds to the vibe of the place.<//Review>

Folks were adhering to the Covid-19 guidelines. Once inside the shop, very cozy and polite employees(we even had a quick Empire Strikes Back conversation). Bought a turkey baguette, banana muffins, ham and cheese croissant, and an almond croissant. All were very scrumptious.👍🏽</text>

This is a great bakery! I usually get the Fruit Pastry and it's always so fresh. The cinnamon rolls are also good. I usually take guests here from out-of-town and they love it too! It does get busy on Farmer Market days though, so be prepared to eat outside!<//review>

I had an almond croissant and it was good, but I asked if I could have it warm and they said they don’t do that because they bake everything fresh everyday. Ok what does that have to do with me wanting to eat a hot croissant instead of a cold one? I also asked what was inside the croissant and they weren’t sure.... whoever is selling your pastries should know what they’re selling....</Text>

<Review>Bread and pastries that rival European bakeries. sourdough flutes are delicious and the rye bread is exceptional. I think they have one of the best rye breads I've ever eaten. I always pick up a couple muffins and a couple pastries when I'm there. Considering the quality of the bread the prices are very reasonable. This place is worth going out of your way for.<//Review>< response>

<Text>Fresh baked goods and bread baked daily. The only problem when you walk in its you want to have one of everything that's on offer! The have a variety of breads that they make wait right there on the premises. You can also get the loaves sliced. Great place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee with a fresh croissant or any of the other treats they have on offer. Highly recommended if you like fresh bread.</Text>< GmapID>

<review>The pastries are amazing!! The staff always greets you with a smile. I can’t say enough about this place. I sit here almost every weekend and drink my coffee and have ham and cheese croissant. I Like to observe the interactions of all the folks that come in. I have to say I am very impressed by their professionalism.<//review>< rate>

< Review>
The sweet pastries? I'm not a fan.
In fact the first time I ever took a bite of anything only to spit it out. Awful. I have super high standards.
The breads and sandwiches are really good. I would say good enough to keep going back.</Review>

<Review>Everything is delish and the service is excellent. Cozy little spot in the  Claremont Village area. You'll want to try one of everything, out go to items are the scones. We like the ginger along with the cranberry orange scones. The coffee served is also good. Staff is friendly and service is quick.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Items here are good.  I have a friend who doesn't come here, she says she can't because she would buy everything.  It is good stuff.  Not a whole lot of room, but the staff get you in and out quickly.  They can run out of stuff, so may want to be aware of that.  I think pretty much everything I have had I have liked.  Parking is ok, may have to walk a block or so.  Entrance is accessible, don't know about bathrooms.  Provide water in paper cups, which is nice.  Will certainly come here again and often.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This is a close to a French bakery as you can get without a 10 hour flight.
In these uncertain times this is truly a local business worth frequenting as my wife and I do twice a week. We live in Glendora and Claremont is a drive worth making. Don't let this truly remarkable bakery go by the wayside.<//Text>

< review>
The croissants here are delicious.  The savory ones are also tasty.  We have tried them all and have not once been disappointed.  We have also  enjoyed their sandwiches.   It is a cute small shop.  Great customer service.  Line moves quickly.  Only awkward thing is coffee extras- cream, sugar, etc are by the door where the line begins to form.  So as those customers are done there is a bit of shuffling to get out the door, or make your way to the line.  Nevertheless, I highly  recommend.< /review>

<review>Fresh bread and yummy pastries. Reminds me of a bakery in Paris or Copenhagen. My favorite is the cranberry pecan bread. Stop by to have coffee and a pastry. Limited seating but if you can find a spot it's like being in Europe and stopping in a cafe.< /review>< Pictures>

We tried SO many goodies on our first visit on a Saturday afternoon.

- Ham & Gruyere Cheese Croissant
- Croissant
- Morning Bun? (weekends only) it has cinnamon sugar on it
- Banana Bread muffin
- Ginger Snap Cookie
- Brownie
- BLAT Sandwich (weekends only) Avocado & turkey

There were still a lot of options left in the bakery case and they have racks of freshly baked bread that they can slice for you too. Also, a lot of pies!

My favorites were the regular croissant (extremely flaky and I felt like I was in EU) and the chewy soft ginger snap cookie. Cannot wait to come back and try more. Tip: Bring your own water bottle as they only have paper cones!<//Text>

<review>I accidentally stumbled upon this place one day while going to the post office, and things have never been the same! Everything from the texture of their brownies to the ambiance AND the people working there is top notch. Crème knows what it is—a feel-good warm and cozy bakery that has all the right things on its menu, and doesn’t try to be anything else! If you’re in town or live in the area, I would 100% recommend this place for an experience that is bound to last in your brain as well as your tongue!</review>< Pictures>

Great selection of pastries however it can get a little pricey quickly. They make incredible sandwiches which are available after 10am or so, my personal favorite is the Jambon-Buerre! Make sure you aren’t in a rush however as you’ll most likely be waiting in a bit of a line. Also, avoids Sunday’s unless you REALLY want their pastries as the farmers market makes for a 15+ minute wait and a line to the door<//text>

My new favorite bakery in my charming town of Claremont.  Today I ran in to get my already favorite bread "Multi Grain' and tried the Gingerbread and LOVE it! So moist so rich with ginger and molasses so good with a cup of tea!  I'm in heaven🤗<//review>

Although, the gluten free options are rare and not at all in the bakery, the owner and the workers were kind and compassionate. The shop smells amazing and the coffee is hot. I do wish there was more gluten free options</Text>

OMG!!! I am so glad I came across this bakery.  Everything looks delicious, I tried the chocolate brownie, chocolate cookie and vegan chocolate cookie (and as you can tell, I love Chocolate). If I had to pick which one was my favorite I would say the brownie. I will definitely be coming back to try their sandwiches.<//review>

Graceful Staff + Beautiful Ambience! I ordered 2 SCONES (Ginger + Cranberry) & 1 Buttery Crispy Chocolate Chip 🍪! $8 tab & ALL worth it if you didn't spend the time-effort baking them yourself! I've recently been told that Créme has a Cinnamon Roll  to live for!! 🤤🥖🥐🍰😚<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Crème Bakery, nestled under tree canopies in Old Town Claremont, buzzes with a steady stream of locals from all walks of life. With barely one step over the threshold, your senses are greeted by freshly baked bread and pastries; your inner child’s face lights up like a Christmas tree or a menorah on the eighth day of Chanukah. The mere sight of all the tasty possibilities snaps yours wallet with a sudden and unrestrained appetite, and the owner’s French, if you happen to be within an ear’s shot, just may delightfully transport you to your favorite street in Paris. There is a respectable menu for teas, and of course, coffee lovers can find a cozy bench spot to enjoy the ambiance. I bought two brioches, and they were worth the 30+ miles drive.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

A Parisienne bakery right in the heart of Claremont.  The scones and croissants are unrivaled as are the delicious sandwiches served on fresh baguettes baked onsite.  The store is always immaculate and the offerings are varied and perfectly baked.  The Strawberry Shortcake Cake is out of this world.  Additionally, prices are very reasonable.  An instant favorite in the Village!<//review>

This morning I dropped in and was immediately impressed with beautiful décor and pastry display. The owner was so helpful and friendly and the treats (jalapeño cheddar scone, banana walnut muffin and chocolate croissant) I shared with my office mates were across the board outstanding. The chocolate croissant, in particular, showcases the bakery's talent, it was the perfect size, light, flaky and oh-so buttery!<//review>

(Translated by Google) The bread in this place is AMAZING. The epitome of well-made bread. Although the price may be a bit high, it is worth it for the taste and because each piece is just right. I could not recommend one thing, but try everything. They will never see bread the same after this.

(Original)
El pan de este lugar es INCREÍBLE. La epítome del pan bien hecho. Sí bien el precio puede ser un poco alto, vale la pena por el sabor y por que cada pieza está en su punto. No podría recomendar una sola cosa, sino prueben todo. No volverán a ver al pan igual después de esto.< /Review>

< Review>
I called a local competitor first and the man wasn't particularly pleasant so I gave Nana's a try. I'm so glad I did. The young woman who took care of me (Daisy) was about the most ideal person you could get for that job. She was friendly, accommodating and even playful. What a joy she made the whole experience! The flowers were delivered promptly and they even printed out a letter I wanted to be delivered with them. First rate service and product! Take a look at these beautiful flowers (from the Mother's Day selection). Look no further than Nana's!< /Review>

<Review>Reading a previous review I was shocked because Nanas did such an amazing job for me. Worth every penny.  Not only do they make beautiful arrangements but they treat you like family. Walking into the shop I learned the designer has been working in the flower business over 20 years and all I can say is that it shows. Just look at this Gorgeous arrangement.</Review><user_id>108854564237011879666< /user_id><gmapID>0x8094674827f05859:0x8508087d6b5a5a82<//gmapID>< response>

I selected this floral shop based off of it's reviews. And HUNNY, let me tell you, these reviews are not wrong! I called Nana's Flower Shop to place an order last minute. Leanna & Daisy were so wonderful to me!! :) They were easy to talk to and were so patient with me. They definitely made sure I got the floral bouquet I originally wanted. I asked if they offer same-day delivery and they definitely came through. Even though they were full for their deliveries that day, they were super sweet to squeeze me in. On top of that, their birthday bouquet was exactly how it was pictured on the website! Because one photo doesn't do justice, here are two, with different angles (bc you know angles matter too. hehe jk). You have definitely earned my business from now on. :) Thank you so much!<//text>

< Review>
Our family/friends ordered several large memorial wreaths and a couple of arrangements from Nana's for our loved one's memorial service.  Nana's did an absolutely fabulous job!  They were very friendly and helpful, and the wreaths and arrangements were beautiful!  Especially the cremation wreath - it was just gorgeous - huge beautiful roses, carnations, mums and lilies!  We will definitely order from Nana's again and highly recommend.  Thank you Nana's!</Review>

<user_name>Jayne Cardenas</user_name><text>I went into their shop on Feb 01 2021 and wanted a small floral arrangement delivered with beautiful, vibrant colors. I didn’t get the persons name who helped me, but she was very nice and professional.  The arrangement was delivered the same day as the purchase.  The order delivery confirmation receipt was emailed to me along with a picture of the arrangement. The arrangement was beautiful. The recipient of the flowers called and thanked me. She said they were gorgeous, smelled good, and brought a smile to her face. Thank you so much Nana’s.  You earned a new customer.< /text>< pictures>

The first time I used Nanas Flower Shop was in June 2019, to order a spray for my Grandfather’s funeral.  It was last minute, but I went in and they worked with me. The spray was ordered and delivered the same day. I was in awe of their amazing work. As faith would have it, unfortunately,  I had to call again in Feb 2020 for flowers for my Aunt’s funeral. I’m currently out the country, but they took all my information over the phone and made a GORGEOUS arrangement. Once it was delivered I received a confirmation with a picture. I was in such a shock I called to thank them for over meeting my expectations. I will always use this company for flowers. They’re kind, accommodating, and have great customer service. Thank you for making the hard times in my life a little less stressful.

<review>I emailed them in the morning around 7am in CST, because in their website says to email or call, so I emailed instead.  No response.  2pm in CST. I made a call out because I thought to give it a try with all those good reviews I've read. Rang 1 min, no one answered. Thought maybe they may be busy. Called again 5 min later. This women was really helpful & nice. Flowers were delivered like mentioned. However, the flowers looks pretty dead. I'm a little bit angry about it because I pay almost $80 for everything.</review><username>Mai Yang< /username><user>109185377392733763686</user><time>1610738279658<//time>< response>

I recently had my grandson's services on 6/19/2020 and I just ordered my flowers and a standing spray on 6/17/2020 from Nana's shop.
I'm 💯% satisfied with their services. The lady who took my order was very pleasant and helpful also put in a special order for blue carnations.
My son and his wife were so happy to see we got the blue 💙 carnations. They delivered my order an hour before the services started. And most of all they were the cheapest compared to other places I called
Thank you Nana's for making my grandson's special day more special. God bless 🙏< /review>

I found them on google and I'm so glad I paid them a visit. They were very friendly and the best part, their prices were great. I felt like a boss giving these to my special lady and I saved money on top of that.

That's what you call a win win ;)< /text>< Pictures>

This small family owned flower shop is fantastic! My wedding anniversary is today and just like a man waited to last minute to get flowers (hahaha) but nonetheless the service is absolutely wonderful, the price is very very reasonable and the flower arrangements are impeccable. I recommend this flower shop to everyone. I will personally be back for all my flower needs.</review>

<Text>They did a wonderful job with a flower arrangement that I ordered for a funeral!  Beautiful roses!  Nice big flowers!  Also, I came in for a last minute order for 8 red rose boutineers.  Since it was last minute, I did not know if they would be able to do it.  Not only were they able to do them but they did them in about 10 minutes!  I was impressed!  I highly recommend this shop for all your flower needs!< /Text></record>

Beautiful flower arrangement! Last minute corsage and boutonniere for tomorrow, and Mothers Day on the same weekend, and these folks said Yes! Been turned away everywhere else. They whipped the flowers out in less than 10 minutes. I recommend them for their beautiful work and great customer service.< /review>

My favorite flower shop in Fresno! They always do great work. It is a little pricey, but you really are paying for the quality.< /Text>

Worst customer service I have ever had. Needed flowers for a quick wedding. Got there at closing time   but employee didn't seem to care and said they were closed. I will go there nor do recommend anyone ever going there. I guess a few minutes of someone's time to help make a moment special is not worth it for Nana or her employees.<//text>

Ran in here figuring last minute flower arrangement would cost alot as last place I went cost an arm and a leg but this place had wonderful prices lower than the other places I have gone and my gf loved this arrangement more than any other I have gotten for her. Even I am really enjoying them. Thank you guys for the wonderful arrangement the great price and the really great customer service you provided. I'll be returning many more times.</Review>

This has become our go to Ramen place. The food is great. The service is fast and friendly. The Ramen is of course the main event - tasty, you can make it spicy for a buck, customized toppings, choice of broth - piping hot! But the appetizer list is a killer - i almost think of skipping the Ramen - chicken, edamame, roasted pork, scallops - the bomb.
Also the yelp wait-list is the only way to go. Otherwise you will get stuck standing out and getting hungry and angry.

Go!</Text>

<Text>I still give this place 5 stars but compared to the hype I've heard from the Cupertino branch, it was okay. Don't get me wrong. Fantastic soup, noodles, egg and chicken karaage. Absolutely delicious. But not mind blowing. And they definitely need to take a page from Ryowa Ramen in Mountain View and serve Kimchi on the side.< /Text><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Great takeout during COVID. Was really craving ramen and this was one of the closest places that offered takeout. Ordering was easy (on their website or Uber Eats) and our food was ready in <15 minutes. Packaging was good - the soup and noodles+toppings are separated and tasted great at home. Also recommend the karaage!</Text>

If you're craving some Ramen as well as other creative and delicious Japanese cuisines,  then "Orenchi Ramen" on Broadway in Redwood City is your 'Go-To' Spot. Trendy crowd,  busy atmosphere and professional service from a friendly staff is the best way to describe this resto. Due to is popularity, there was about a 15 minute wait to be seated. But it was worth it.  We hung out inside where it was warm and cozy.. The dining area was filled with a plethora of appetizing aromas. Decent prices too.  Enjoy!<//review>

Wait is long during peak times of the day. Karaage is juicy. Ramen noodles are delicious, toppings are conservative. Spicy costs extra. Environment is cozy. Staff is friendly. Location is across from the  Caltrain station. Definitely a great place to eat in Redwood City. Just make sure you have some time to wait.< /text>

Best ramen in bay area. Their tonkotsu is super chicken forward and their spicy miso is very savoury. Takoyaki was crispy. I recommend ordering with less salt.< /text>

My friend and I choose this spot out of convenience for the both of us. I had to drive down from SF after flying in from LA and he drove up from SJ and Redwood Citt was the midpoint we choose. We cane here on a Saturday night around 6 and there was some wait to it but it wasn't too long of a wait. As we were led to our table, the server just handed us the menu and away we searched for our meal. We decided on their Orenchi ramen, since it's in their name so it had to be good. Turns out, the broth is full of flavor but nothing really wowed me. I honestly believe ramen in LA tastes better than this place like Shinshengumi or even Daikokuya. The ramen we ordered doesn't have a great presentation when given at the table. Everything is always about presentation, especially when it comes to food.

Next in this review are their two appetizers we ordered; shishito peppers and beer battered onion rings. The peppers were lacking in flavor but some of them had a great kick. Onion rings were probably my favorite at this ramen shop. Nicely fried and hot all around. What threw me off was that they served it with a piece of shishito pepper on top. Nonetheless, I enjoyed every bite.</Text>

<Review>1st time to visit here and, it is actually not bad .  Ordered Calamari and the most popular ramen.  OMG, the soup is amazing and the sauce for Calamari is spicy but so good matching.   It is worth to visit this place to try more taste in the future.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Is there the owner changed ? The food is 10 times worse than what before SIP. Even before SIP, this store still not as good as the one in Santa Clara but at least ok. Now, this is just $5 super market MSG ramen quality but charging $20 out the door. Avoid !!!</text><rating>1</rating>< GmapID>

< review>
Took the veggie TanTan Ramen, the broth was surprisingly flavorful and the dish was colorfully decorated. We took the spicy miso sauce on the side to make it more spicy. Enjoyed the Ramen in the cold damp weather. Recommend.<//review>

<Text>Orenchi does it again! Brand new restaurant but already lovely service, great menu selection (incl craft Japanese beers) and of course amazing ramen! Soft boiled egg is on point, ramen noodles perfectly cooked, broth the right amount of flavor and richness! Thanks orenchi team!<//Text>< username>

<review>The service is great, the wait was short (10min).  The karage chicken was good, and that's the only I would recommend getting.  I had ordered the tonkatsu ramen, and it wasn't anything special.  The whole ramen tasted like instant ramen flavor, the broth was bland, and came with one slice of pork that was also flavorless.  This spot taste much different than the Orenchi in Santa Clara; which is delicious and worth the wait.   I wonder if this Redwood City has different owner running it.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This place is doubtless one of the finest restaurants in the neighborhood. Every time I come to this place I am greatly satisfied. They keep their high  standard service and the topmost level of cooking  they serve. You no doubt will love this restaurant. Warmly  recommended.</Review>

I've been to bad restaurants and wonder why they got good ratings, but Orenchi is still a big surprise for me.
Seeing the great reviews on Google Map and Yelp, I decided to come here for lunch. Waiting was fine, but my foods came out horrifying.
Despite my Karamiso ramen has a layer of pork fat floating on the broth, it still barely has any flavor but saltiness. The Chasiu was just a thin piece of bland boiled pork.
The onion rings came out as some home cook tried to make onion rings from scratch for the first time and miserably failed. It was soggy and soaked with oil, and it dripped oil all over the table.
Like most ramen places, there's basically no service.
I really couldn't understand how did they make it so far with several locations. This is the worst ramen place I have tried so far in the bay area, no one of.</text>

One of my favorite ramen places in the bay area. This location is slightly smaller than the Santa Clara location but is just as delicious. I came here for dinner with a friend on a cold night and it was exactly what I needed. The chicken kaarage is fresh, hot and crispy. I ordered the orenchi ramen is it was full of amazing flavors, perfectly cooked noodles, and delicious pork.

It's not as busy as the Santa Clara location and also features Yelp check in which is great.<//Review>

Sadly, came to find the place empty, the menu drastically different with prices 2x and 4x increased. No more scallops. No more coming to Orenchi.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Orenchi is a great family run place, you can sit at a table, booth, bar or outside. I really appreciated that the waiter warned me of the spicy miso being surprisingly spicy, so I got it on the side to add it little by little rather than be overwhelmed by how hot it is. Great noodles and broth, highly recommend a visit while waiting on your Caltrain!< /text>

Overall great experience! The broth of the Orenchi Ramen is really good and the noodles are cooked perfectly. My only minor complaint is that there was too little pork in the ramen for an almost $14 bowl. The prices are in general on the expensive side for the ambiance and service of the restaurant although their happy hour from Mon to Thus after 7.30 pm makes it a great deal for drinks and some snacks. The garlic scallops were also delicious. Would definitely go there again.< /Review>

Great ramen! Have tried them all and like the tonkatsu the most. They have seasonal specials too, worth checking them out. I love their chicken karaage (sort of like fried chicken, japanese style) and takoyaki.
Service is very fast and now you can join the waitlist remotely, so you dont need to wait long. Cooks and waiters smile and greet, making you feel very welcomed. Love the place and the staff. Great job, keep it up!<//review>

Had the orenchi Ramen with level 1 spicy.  It was so flavourful. Toppings were lacking a bit, and soft boiled egg was a bit too soft (and a little cold) but the bounce of the noodles and the chewyness of the noodles were amazing. I definitely recommend</Review>

Good ramen spot that seems to be quite busy.  Atmosphere was nice as well.  I ended up trying a special ramen they had advertised that I believe was vegan or vegetarian curry ramen that looked really interesting. (I eat meat but enjoy vegetarian/vegan food as well)  I have to say it was very good.  It had a lot of great mix ins and I think the broth actually tasted better than my friends regular pork based ramen.  They did forget to bring a couple things to our table we asked for but other than that it definitely satisfied that ramen craving during lunch.</review>

<review>The last-last time I went to Orenchi, I thought it was okay but not really that good or impressive. *This* time, however, struck a different tune. Right from the get-go, my impression (first impression for this location, anyway) was positive. While looking for parking, I was able to use the Yelp app to add my name to the waiting list. Then upon arriving, the remaining wait was only a few minutes despite how busy it was (I don't think the other people waiting seemed very happy about it though, since it looked like I skipped the line lol); we were seated at the bar. My bf and I shared the karaage chicken which seemed like a huge portion, even for sharing. Then we both (separately) ordered one of the ramens that were on special. Everything was delicious, and seemed even better by the fact that we had been driving around for a while looking for a place to eat before finding this one on the app. I'm glad I gave Orenchi another go since I was def impressed ;)<//review>< Pics>

<username>Musho Pea<//username><user>109274499606921160711<//user><review>Waited 100+ mins for below average ramen. 😡 Disappointed. The noodles were bitter and lack bite. The chasiu was thin and melt in your mouth but there was so little. The egg was nice though.

If you're looking for authentic delicious ramen run by Japanese, try Santa Ramen in San mateo (~20min queue) . You'll KNOW the difference. Inshou ramen in foster city has no wait time and has a comforting curry ramen that's way tastier.

Good ramen and a nice sake selection. The only gripe was how they prepared the shishito peppers- usually one of my favorite dishes but these were served nearly raw and with no bonito shavings<//text>

Good ramen, but did not blow me away.  Will continue to go back though as it is good, local, nice servers and clean place.  If there is outdoor seating in the summer that will go a long ways as well.</review>

Good authentic flavors, we tried all soup options (spicy miso, tonkatsu, shoyu and shio). Tonkatsu soup is sweet with mild good pork flavor. Shio is subtle and complex. Fried squid legs and croquette are the best appetizers, each with a great sauce. The chasu slice also has great porky flavor despite how thin or small it is. Overall I love that the soup is not overly think and had clean focused flavors.</text>

Now I can get my ramen fix whenever I feel like it! Downtown RWC doesn't have a great selection of decent ethnic food, so Orenchi will do.

I usually get the shoyu ramen but the tonkotsu is also good. The karaage is a big portion so that's good if you're hungry. The spicy version of the karaage is VERY spicy, FYI.

There's usually a wait after they open so use Yelp Waitlist or get there when they open. Turnover is pretty fast so it's not a big deal on weekdays; weekends are tougher.< /text>< Response>

I have been going here for more than a year now, and I have seen them decline in quality ever since.

Noodles are not consistent, seaweed size has been declining, bamboo shoots don’t seem fresh, and the broth is all over the place. For the price, it’s pretty bad.</Review>

<Review>Top-notch tonkotsu ramen. The broth was smooth but not as homogenized as typical - a more homey style. The ramen was slightly al dente. All the ingredients were great. They used a whole egg. It was cooked harder than I prefer but that made it easier to eat a little at a time.<//Review><name>Danny Epstein</name><user_id>105525679468969305468< /user_id>< Pictures>

Reviewing Orenchi in 2019 has been a challenge. I have to give it an average rating. The scene for ramen has blossomed in the Bay. We're getting direct from Japanese restaurants and this has raised the standard for everyone. Orenchi is still the touchstone, but the competition is fierce now. I do recognize their expansion efforts. Making it much easier to enjoy ramen and not having to wait as long as before. I would eat here everyday.</text>

If you're expecting the same quality as in Japan, you'll be disappointed. For the US this place is passable taste wise but a poor value unfortunately.<//text>

<text>The spicy fries were out of this world good. The ramen was tasty and the noodles chewy. Be aware of the waitlist and sign up before you even arrive to cut down on your wait time. The service is quick but they do get quite busy and didn’t seat all tables at once.< /text>< Pictures>

We arrived at 5:45. 20 people waiting outside. Only half of the tables were occupied. The restaurant smelled strongly of fried food. Looked more like a cafeteria style restaurant in its decor. And, very loud music was playing. We did not wait for a table. Disappointed as we have been to their sister restaurant in Los Altos and really enjoyed the food, ambience and service. This location is much closer to where we live so were excited to see it open.< /Text>

< review>
I love orenchi, I really recommend trying them out! Their broth is flavorful and well balanced, and their noodles always have the right amount of bite to them in my opinion. They even succeeded in accommodating a party of 13 of us which was very very much appreciated!<//review>

<review>Good ramen and awesome appetizers. The staff is pretty quick to get your order and food out too - but usually there is a line to get seated.

If you want to avoid the lunch line get there at 1130 or 1245, otherwise you’re likely to wait for 20 minutes.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

No wait before 6 on a Friday surprised us since we're used to there being a wait at the Santa Clara location at any time. Not sure if that was because of the music on the square or if that's normal. Quite a selection of appetizers and food was quick to come out. Don't expect to linger but that's not an issue for us.</text>

Ramen portion size is big. I left almost half of it. Need to make advance reservations in Yelp if you don't want to wait for a long time. Removing 2 stars as the water glass they gave had a stain on the rim as it was not cleaned properly. Lost my appetite because of that.<//Text>

<Text>They have an online waitlist on Yelp. The ramen is good and they have the best soft boiled egg.

A ramen bowl in front of you is worth two that you have to wait hours in line for. I love ramen but I hate “ramen culture.” Is that a thing? Who wants to wait in line for hours? Why do no ramen restaurants take reservations? Why can’t they at least do virtual lines?

Enter Orenchi. Join the Yelp waitlist, drive over, get your bowl of ramen. Sometimes you just need your ramen fix and don’t have all evening to devote to it. Go to Orenchi. Be happy.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
The ramen is absolutely delicious. The *only* detail I would have liked differently is that I prefer to have the egg with a gooey yolk. They also have a good, albeit slight sweet, sake on tap and a good selection of non-ramen dishes.

The venue is also nicely styled to feel like a street-side ramen bar. While it can be a bit crowded, and it seems to fill up fast, it doesn't feel like the space is overfilled.

The prices are also sightly more expensive than I'd expect, but the food is very well prepared, and considering how quickly I received it, I'm very happy with my experience.</Review>

Their most popular ramen is tonkotsu. Broth is quite good, noodles are excellent. They give you a whole egg, and it's comes perfectly, with that velvety texture in the yolk. Ambiance isn't great, with the train station right across the street, but the service is good.< /Review>

Hands down the best ramen restaurant I know. And I've tried ramen shops from all over California. Get the Regular Spicy Orenchi ramen if you're okay with a little extra kick; it's insanely good! Note, though, that with high quality comes popularity; you'll need to get on the wait list most nights if you want a table.<//review>

<text>One of my go-to ramen spots, good quality ramen and usually not much of a wait to get seated. My only complaint would be that when you are paying $20, with tax and tip, for a bowl of ramen you should get at least 2 pieces of chashu, not just 1.<//text><rate>4< /rate><user>115269059461284938405<//user>< resp>

One of the few ramen places in the area and worth checking out.  Make sure you get there early as the line can get pretty long during peak hours, but it tends to move fast.  You can also add your name to the wait list using the Yelp app, but I haven't tried that yet.  The ramen is good as are the appetizers.  They only have 3 types of ramen, but they're all well done.  The food comes out quickly and the service is good.<//Text>

< Review>
Ramen was disappointing, despite being so busy.
This place always seems to be packed with people. But after eating here I'm not sure why. We got edamame and two of the three ramens dishes on the regular menu. It's hard to mess up edamame so that was fine. The ramen though was downright disappointing. It wasn't horrible, just lacked any depth of flavor. The pork was thin and flavorless, I even got extra meat and it wasn't nearly enough. The broths were only okay...the broth should be the main attraction! They don't even provide any condiments to add (bean sprouts, Sriracha, soy, other sauces, etc.). Very underwhelming experience after all the hype.</Review>

Ramen of course is in the name, and the house ramen dish I had was fantastic. But their appetizers, unexpected and wonderful, I crave their takoyaki, fabulous little savory donut holes, and the boneless fried chicken.<//Text>

Solid tonkatsu and the spicy miso does have a bit of a kick to it. Their pork is often too fatty and once closing time comes, they don't let you finish your meal in peace, cleaning around you and otherwise making you feel uncomfortable.<//Review>

When I heard they opened a location in my new town, I was then worried that it wouldn't live up the original location. Boy was I wrong, the ramen is identical. The only changes that I've noticed so far are the different appetizer items, the less than perfectly peeled eggs, and the extra spicy here means extra spicy. I'm so excited that Orenchi in RWC lives up to hype.</Text>< Pics>

Okay.. Tonkachu based is okay but the meet inside of it is not edible. Taste like a left over, you will see what I mean.
Soy sauce base soup smells really bad. Instant ramen taste better
Spicy french fry is good</text>

We decided to try it out.  Spent $50 on two bowls of Orenchi Ramen, and two appetizers: Takoyaki, and Chashu.  Alas neither of us really liked the ramen or the Takoyaki, but the chashu was pretty good.  Too bad its the only ramen place in redwood city :(<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

On a weekday, there is hardly a wait.  Plus...  Monday to Thrusday, they have "happy hour" prices on select appetizers, beers and sake.  Their service is quick and attentive.  My husband and I usually order their delicious Orenchi Ramen (Tonkotsu).  We pay extra to make it spicy.  We recently tried their Winter Seasonal Special Ramen, the Donabe Karamiso Ramen.  We thought it was sooo good!  We told them they should keep it on their menu.</text>

A bit of waiting time, but fairly quickly we could be seated, about 10 mins or so arriving at 11:45am Sunday. Ramens are descent,  my choice was Orenchi, and the other two picked Shio and Shoyu, could compare all broth. Each of them is well distinguished, characteristic and thoroughly cooked! The thickness of the noodle is different per bowl. Yum!</Text>

<review>My wife had the pork based broth ramen, the one with the egg (most popular according to menu). I had the soy sauce based ramen for comparison.  My noodles were thinner, hers thicker.  The pork based ramen was much more flavorful to me.  I should have gotten spicy miso sauce, but then my wife couldn't have tried my dish.  The butter garlic scallop appetizer was GREAT!  I liked that they serve the whole scallop and not just the round cylinder.  The house sake was not worth getting as we both prefer cold sake.  The waiter was very helpful in explaining the menu.</review>< pictures>

<time>1526133340355< /time><Rate>4< /Rate><Text>For fans of the original location in Santa Clara, Orenchi is Redwood City is a welcome and much needed ramen option on the Peninsula. While SF has a plethora of options (Mensho, Marufuke, Ippudo, Orenchi Beyond), the Peninsula has largely been only Santa Ramen and its outposts Ramen Dojo and Parlour that are all mentioned less frequently with greater competition coming from Japan.

Orenchi is often acknowledged as one of the best, if not the best ramen shops in the South Bay, mainly for their signature tonkotsu broth, in house made thick noodles, and perfect ramen eggs.

Lines are nowhere as long as the Santa Clara outpost but Redwood City is an upcoming area and enough young people and tech workers  (Box is nearby) are such that the sign up list had 10 people before even opening.

Thankfully, food service is fairly efficient and appetizers and ramen comes out promptly. We enjoyed the Karaage (signature item given Sumika background), the spicy fries with wasabi, and the Ikura Gohan.  Tip: prepare for a wait, sample the appetizers, and enjoy a great bowl of ramen in the Peninsula.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I'm not a ramen fan.  I especially don't appreciate hot bowls of ramen during hot summer days.  Orenchi changes everything for me.  I've  tried lots of ramen in the Bay Area and in Asia, but Orenchi is the best I've ever had and one I'll actually crave even on hot summer days.  I never drink soup broth, but I enjoy drinking the entire Orenchi ramen broth.  If I'm going to have ramen, it now must be Orenchi ramen or nothing!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Tonkotsu has thicker noodle than Shoyu. Both taste great.< /Review>

Omg the orenchi ramen made me feel like I was pregnant or something afterward. I was so full it hurt to walk and I didn't even finish all the broth. Really really great ramen. Also if you're vegetarian - there's pork in the ramen so make sure to ask to have that removed. The broth actually has pork fat too so there's no way around that unless you get a different base.<//text>

Broth is a little thicker. Noodles are egg noodles and taste very eggy, but they are perfect al dente.<//Review>

Good tonkatsu broth, excellent egg, but the cha-shu are thin and I could smell the chlorine rinse on the spoon. I'll go again, but by far not my favorite.<//Text>

We showed up about 10 minutes before the dinner soft opening on February 1st and was shocked to have no wait.

The service was great. The staff was full of excitement on opening day, and our food came out extra fast and steaming hot.

I liked the chicken karaage better than in Sunnyvale - medium-thick breading, extra crispy, and juicy! The pieces were very large too.

They didn't have the awesome Ore No Tan Tan Men (miso, sesame) available yet, so we got the Orenchi Ramen (tonkotsu) and the Shoyu Ramen (soy sauce).

I loved the springy, al dente noodles! The Shoyu Ramen had straighter, thinner noodles which I slightly preferred. I also liked that the soy sauce broth wasn't too salty, and it had good depth of flavor.

The tonkotsu broth here was a bit light for my taste, but the chili and garlic paste amped it up. Don’t miss out on that garlic paste! It added nice depth without being too harsh.

I thought the chashu pork was pretty average and thin, but the broth and noodles were great on both bowls.

Hitachino Nest on tap was perfect to wash it all down.

Definitely a welcome addition to the ramen desert here! I'll be a regular.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< review>
I've been to Dojo, Parlor, Santa, etc, but I like Orenchi the best. Their tonkotsu ramen with spicy miso is to die for.

The ramen is always served piping hot, noodles perfectly al dente, eggs soft boiled with runny yolk, chashu lightly roasted so it's tender and melts in your mouth, and broth kotteri (with emulsi pork fat) so that it's extra rich and creamy. The spicy miso gives it just the right kick to make it the perfect bowl, so it's definitely worth the wait.

I've tried most of the appetizers, and you can't go wrong with any of them. But the ones that stood out the most to me were the nankotsu karage (fried chicken cartilage with sweet glaze), spicy fries (served with wasabi aeoli *amazing*), and chashu gohan (marinated pork belly over rice). If you get the chance, try the hitachino on tap, you won't regret it.

This is a great place to go to grab drinks and food with your friends. It's always bustling and they always have good music playing. It's a much needed establishment in the ramen desert that is this part of the peninsula. Make sure to get there early to put your name down on the wait list, or get their like 45 minutes before closing if you want to avoid the wait.< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The stuffed octopus croquettes are very good. The delicious ramen, especially the egg it brings. They serve the food very fast but you have to go prepared because the size of the ramen is immense.
