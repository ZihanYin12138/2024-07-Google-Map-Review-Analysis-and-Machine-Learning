<review>In love with my glasses and great experience overall. Dr. Truong is super nice and knowledgeable, the eye exam he offers is very thorough and detailed. His wife Mary is also amazing, not only helped me figured out my insurance situation but also accommodated shipping arrangement since I was only in town for a weekend. Thank you so much Imagine Optometry!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9RA7lypLjzPIuv2ydV_mrE1vWl8XsmUa2APjg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaI7iGExSoN6l4_GaAxNnCuvISuiSdi4L_9Qki=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwMDIG_APH3jH2K_xQYvbpGI0lQL2wjGCkHFM9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

The Doctor has been teaching at UC Berkley optometry school so he's up-to date with latest development and technologies.   They carry the latest trendy frames and I've always been happy with their service and exams.   I've been with them for 3 years now, and I recommended several of my friends to this place as well.< /review>< gmap_id>

<name>Viren Pandit</name><user>113374097989499823760</user><Review>Went in for getting a new pair of glasses. This is an unprofessional, thoroughly messed up state of affairs from eye exam to delivery of eyeglasses, when I had spent $500 on a new frame with these bunch of  unprofessional, untrained jokers.

1. After me complaining that the new pair of glasses they sent me home with seemed wrong; they realized their lab had made a mistake and sent me the wrong prescription altogether.
2. They "fixed" the glasses in another 2 weeks and sent me home with another pair. This didn't feel right too as it made my eyesight blurred.
3. Doctor did another tests and figures out that the initial eye exam was wrong and had to change it. Seems like he missed doing those tests in the first place. Back to the lab a 3rd time.
4. I get a pair of glasses again. Try it on and in their shop itself, it seems wrong. Doctor comes out slightly apologetic, that they messed up again and sent me the wrong prescription. Back to the lab for the fourth time in 4 months!

I walk back to my car to calm down, came back in and mentioned that I don't want to deal with this unprofessional place anymore, and want a full refund. They did give my money back, but with the doctor calling this "bad luck", for which I give them this 1-star for.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff that takes the time to answer all your questions and find the best vision correction options for you. I have been going to Imagine for years but have been hesitant to attend any regular appointments during covid. However, Dr Truong and the team at Imagine took many safety precautions and I felt very comfortable.< /text>

That was my first time at Imagine Optometry. I chose the place based on review only. Now, I am glad to share my positive experience too.
Farayha helped me during my visit! Super patient, friendly, knowledgeable lady! She has spent with me more than hour only choosing the frames I needed.
I am super pleased and can't wait to get my new glasses!</review>

You are greeted by welcoming smile, even behind the mask you can see a smile through the gleaming eyes. The doctor is very attentive with your needs and the staff are very helpful with your selection of eyeglass frames. Going the extra mile plus.< /Review>

<Review>I love this place! Dr. Truong and his staff are kind, accommodating, very knowledgeable, and attentive. My appointment went well with my high-energy toddler in tow, which says a lot. It is pricy but worth it if you can afford it for the high level of care. They also take a lot of types of insurance. They don’t have a lot of my style when it comes to frame selection but my glasses preferences are a bit old school. The decor and atmosphere are also very trendy and welcoming.< /Review>< Pics>

I found this doctor online after seeing all 5 stars reviews. My whole family went there to experience Dr. Truong and his team’s service. It was a great trial. The staffs were very polite and friendly, especially Mary and Sandy. Dr. Truong was very nice, detailed, knowledgeable and professional. They were also very caring by sending us follow-up messages offering to adjust the glasses for us if we needed. We plan to go back there next year. This is the best optometry here.<//text>

<Review>First of all a clean place considering the times we are in today. Following CDC safety guidelines, sanitization and wiping down equipments... Great Job

Now coming to attention and treatment. Right from the time I entered the place till I walked out, got a positive feeling, that I came to the right place. Great care was taken and not rushing through with procedure and tests.
Dr.Truong is definitely knowledgeable and has good experience. Definitely recommend this Optometey.</Review><Name>Rajesh Devidasani<//Name><rate>5<//rate><Gmap_id>0x808fe8d9baaaa84b:0xd081abffa29246bc</Gmap_id>< resp>

<review>As always I had a very good experience at Imagine Optometry. With Covid being a very important part of deciding to do an exam or not, they made the decision much easier. They took all the precautions necessary to ensure my safety and that of their employees. The Doctor was very thorough and even helped pick my glasses. I appreciate the good and careful care I received  at my exam

Sincerely very well impressed with the quality of service and the products. I've been a client for almost 2 years, purchased multiple glasses and contacts for my family of 5. I feel that the staff takes genuine interest on our needs and looks for the best options for us. I've been wearing glasses all my life and I can tell when a doctor knows what they’re doing. They were quick, really friendly and great to work with. Highly recommend.</Text>

Go to Dr. Tan!

Dr. Tan is extremely informative and patient! I've gone to see him for contacts and glasses and got a good deal on two of my glasses.

I also brought my son for his first eye exam and Dr. Tan was so patient! Overall, and family friendly office, warm, helpful, and kind staff!  And a great selection of sunglasses and glasses and great new site!</Text>

Searching for the best optometrist out there? Look no further IMAGINE Optometry is by far the best eye clinic you'll ever experience! I was overdue for my routine eye exam and in search for a good optometrist who was patient enough to answer all of my questions and thoroughly explain every detail of the exam and my results. IMAGINE Optometry went above and beyond my expectations! Dr. Tan was not only patient but made sure to examine my eyes using the latest technology and every exam possible to determine the best solution for my problem! Mary, his wife provided exceptional support in choosing the right pair of glasses for my sister and I without making us feel rushed in any way, much so that it took us about an hour to decide on the perfect fit after exhausting every possible option with her help and expertise. Good to note that the office was immaculate clean and they take every precaution possible to make sure that both you and staff are safe during this COVID crisis. I highly recommend IMAGINE Optometry to anyone who wants to be treated as a VIP while getting the most out of their appointment and insurance benefits. This place not only offers exceptional eye exam services but perfectly matches with their high-end top of the line brands like Silhouette, SALT, PRADA, etc...they make sure that you walk out feeling satisfied and happy with your purchase and with an extraordinary customer service experience as a plus plus!<//review>

Loved the office!  Dr Truong was on time (which is huge to me), thorough but fast which was awesome, and very personable. He is easy to talk to as a person rather than just another doctor. I am planning to go back to pick out glasses even though both he and Margaret insisted on staying to help me late.  Margaret is so sweet and darling - love how truthful she is when helping you choose frames!  This place definitely lives up to the Yelp reviews I read before making my appointment there!  Thank you!!!< /Review>

Highly recommending Imagine Optometry!  I had a great experience from start to finish.  The eye exam was very thorough and comprehensive.  They gave me new prescriptions for my glasses and contact lenses.  I’ve been using my new eye glasses for a week now and they feel just right – no more eye strains and headaches! They also recommended a new brand of contact lenses – I tried them for a few days now and they are definitely better than my old ones - so much more comfortable and vision is better.  After the eye exam, they helped me choose the right frame for me.  The one they recommended (IC Berlin frame) suits me so well – I’ve been getting compliments at work on how my new frames look a lot better on me.  Thanks to the amazing team for such great service!< /Review>

Good service and good selection of glasses.  Got a new prescription and ordered new glasses - happy with my selection.

Doctor was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable - explained everything very simply making it easy to understand what was going on.
Staff is very kind and helpful as well

Overall a great experience. Will return for contact lens fitting when I run out of my current ones.</text>

We took our 7 year old son for his optometry appointment today with Dr Truong for the first time.  With SIP in place we had hesitated for weeks to see a doctor even though we knew his eyes were affecting him daily.  I normally as a habit do not write reviews but I want to stress how incredible the experience with Dr. Truong and team have been.  They were amazingly  responsive (replied to txt on Sunday when I inquired about appts), assured us of safety protocols in place, thorough throughout the examination, and patiently addressed my many first time questions. In the end, my son received his first Px, selected the glasses he loved with the help of the office team, and I was encouraged by the treatment strategy for my son’s vision going forward.  The rest of my family will be switching all future visits to Imagine Opt. Thx team. Stay safe.< /Text>

The appointment went by super easily, everybody was very friendly and the office was a breath of fresh air. The interior was comfortable and pleasing to the eye; almost even more so than the eye care!< /Text>

Dr Truong did an exceptional job in eye examination and also does provide very detail explanation of the results. Margaret was very friendly and helpful in booking the appointment and glasses.
Excellent service and amazing ambience.</review>

I had the best optometrist in LA and was skeptical I would find another that would compare but I was wrong! Dr. Tan Truong is patient, kind, very knowledgeable and professional. He helped answer every one of my questions and made me feel confident in the adjustments he recommended for my prescription. His office is beautifully designed and his staff is very kind and welcoming. Mary helped me select new reading glasses from the awesome selection of frames they have available. I highly recommend this optometrist office.<//Review>

One Saturday afternoon on a long weekend, I was "Yelping" ( I guess that is a term these days for searching:-)) for an Optometrist with 5 star reviews, open till late, in the Tri-Valley, and accepts VSP! Hurray!! I found Imagine Optometry!!! Thrilled and excited, I decided to drive there. The office ambience is very contemporary and I really liked the colorful paintings of Gandhi and the Beatles! Staff was super friendly! I was able to schedule my whole family's appointment for the next day which was a Sunday!  Fast forward to the appointment next day, All of us were very impressed with Dr. Truong. He is super knowledgeable and extremely patient and helpful! The exam was very thorough! Now it was time to select the glasses:-).  Which can be fun but challenging too! Margaret, the receptionist, was great in helping us pick the right front frames. But a HUGE loud Shout-out Mary, Dr. Truong's wife! She is awesome! Mary is extremely patient, helpiful, and knowledgeable! She helped each of us pick frames, took care of the measurements and all the paperwork! My teenage son had hard time selecting the frame. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They were not at all pushy and didn't try to promote expensive frames and add ons!  My son ended up picking frame from Imagine line. ( that's when we found that the talented and creative couple also has their designer frame line.)
We went back after a couple of weeks to get the glasses. They adjusted the frames if we found them to be tad loose. Everyone of us had a fantastic experience! We have gone back several times and will continue to do so! I have referred many of my friends to them as well. If you are looking for an Optometrist, look no further!'<//review>

< Review>
Look no Further this is the BEST optometrist in Northern California. Having been seen by many other optometrists in the bay area (that either treats you like another number or move provide you with BASIC services).
Then you need to STOP by and SEE Dr. Truong he is the best and will take the time to do a thorough examination to make sure that your vision health is the best it can be. Not to mention his office has the latest optometry equipment and carries all the designer brands glasses to keep you looking styling and fresh.
If you're a new resident in the Bay Area, I strongly recommend Imagine Optometry! Let Dr. Truong take care of your vision, so you can SEE why he's highly rated! :)<//Review>

<Review>Popped into this office while I was shopping in the area. I had been having occasional headaches during my long work days with me staring at my computer screen and phone for hours on end. Dr Truong was very helpful and knowledgeable in that he mentioned getting work glasses with anti-reflective coating would help block blue light that emits from digital devices. This could help alleviate eye strain, blurred vision, sometimes even headaches when using devices for long periods of time. I ended up getting prescribed glasses, and I have to say - after wearing these glasses for about a month now, they have helped me tremendously at work! Not only was Dr. Truong very informative and helpful, the process of getting the glasses was seamless. I got trendy Dolce & Gabbana glasses AND Tom Ford sunglasses and am very happy with the outcome of my visit :) The frame selection was the best I've seen in any office in the area, and even better - it was all reasonably priced. Overall - fantastic experience and would definitely recommend Imagine Optometry to all of my friends and family.< /Review>< username>

I usually do not write reviews for businesses but I had to for this place. I found Imagine Optometry via the VSP website. I went with them purely based on the fact that they had the most fresh, well designed, and interesting website.

Note to all you other optometrists in the Bay Area, spend some money and update your websites!! They look like they were designed in the early 2000. We live in a time that responsive design is a must. As a person that works in the tech industry I will always close your website and move on within seconds of seeing how your website is designed. First impressions are a must.

Anyways, Imagine Optometry’s online appointment process was super easy and fast. I was able to get an appointment in minutes and received text message updates that made things very convenient.

My appointment experience was amazing. The facility was super cool and hype. Beautiful displays and the best artwork on the walls.

Dr. Truong was really nice and knowledgeable. He told me things about my eyes that no other optometrist has ever told me. I have been seeing different optometrist for 36 years now and I wonder why they felt like that info was not important to tell me.

Coolest thing of all was that within minutes I realized where the name Imagine came from. This place was inspired by John Lennon and you can see it all over the place. As a music lover and musician I appreciated that so much. Dr. Truong was also very knowledgeable in music so our conversation was awesome. We talked music the whole time which I loved.

The only downside of Imagine Optometry is that it’s new and so Dr Truong does not have the assistance of others. He was kind of a one man shop but that didn’t change my rating which is still 5 stars.

I will be a long time patient for sure!! This place is amazing.</Text>

They didn't have the car we had booked 2 weeks beforehand and then the guy sent us to another location (since he didn't want to deal with this problem) The other location also did not have the car ready for us. The entire thingy ended up delaying our trip by 2 hours. The unapologetic guy kept blaming us for not adjusting to a smaller car, just because it's a weekend and there is a lot of rush.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Waited for over an hour for service here and then another 2 to actually receive the car after being turned away at the Alum Rock location of Hertz. Sadly this is the last time I’ll book with Hertz. Understand the demand is surging for rentals but Hertz needs to figure out their inventory and reservation process.<//text>

<review>My husband and I were in San Jose traveling and had an accident where someone actually hit our car while we were inside a store shopping. We ended up needing a rental car. I called Enterprise first and they kept asking for my credit card which kind of weirded me out.  So I hung up and tried Hertz. The super sweet guy I talked to was so empathetic and when I told him my situation the first thing he asked was if we were okay. They hooked us up with a nice car to drive home to Merced in. The car was clean and nice. He even gave us a bottle of water while we waited for the paperwork to be completed. I 100% recommend these guys!! If I even need to rent a car again I will without a doubt be giving Hertz my business! Thank you for your kindness and personable employees!< /review><time>1578343042632</time><Resp>{'time': 1578638500555, 'text': "Aloha Kayla, thank you so very much for taking the time to reach out to us, and leave a rating!

<Text>When I picked up the rental car I was told that there is only 1 dollar additional charge on top of what my insurance is covering. So I agreed. Come to find out after 2 weeks I get charged 38 dollars. Shockingly the employee who was on his cell phone the whole time when he was helping me out FORGOT to mention the sales tax!!! Very bad customer service...<//Text><name>Adorina Sargezian< /name></record>

The driver that picked me up at the body shop was courteous and helpful.  However the customer service person in the store was not present, no hello. Please or thank you, spent time on his phone while I called my insurance co.  to get information he need.
Because of his attitude I would not choose this location unless necessary.<//text>

< review>
I rented a car from this location for my week in the Bay Area.  The staff was super nice and helpful.  The car I got was exactly what I asked for.  I will rent from this location again.  They even called a Lyft for me to get me to the airport.  It was great.< /review>

Surprised, amazed & whhaaatt an experience. This can't be, I feel like I'm getting pranked.  Wasn't expecting to receive such a stellar customer service from Mr Rhys Sanchez .  From the beginning, he was incredibly courteous, polite & emphatize w/me, due to the mishap I had when someone back into my car leaving church parking lot.  It was an incident & series of headaches I have to go through, which could've been easily avoided if the defendant/insured Al could've just looked over his left shoulder,  other than rushing to get out.  Additionally, I called all around town to obtain a car rental replacement & they were either not picking up their calls or ran out of cars.  So, Mr Rhys handled my reservation, greeted me as soon as I walked in & he handled everything like a pro.  I walked out of Hertz feeling much relieved because of what Mr Rhys have done. He was quite helpful, showed his sincere concern & provided me an excellent, over the top customer service, sight unseen or rare in his industry.  I've been renting cars for over 2 decades now & as a service provider myself, who've served & is still serving in the military, these are the kind of people we rely heavily on to accomplish our mission & expect to have our back, any & every time.  Thank you, Mr Rhys Sanchez.  Your simply outstanding!< /Text>

< review>
Do not rent from this Hertz location. I made a car rental for an insurance-backed car repair at Fix Auto, and even though I returned the car on time to the shop, Hertz charged me an extra 12 days on my credit card due to a mistake on their part. Even after numerous escalations to the regional manager and the main corporate branch, the issue remains unresolved after 2 weeks. A reputable location would have a manager that does all that he can to rectify an error they made as quickly as possible, escalating up the management chain as necessary. Daniel, the manager at this location, seems unwilling to do so, and it this is very disappointing to see. The regional manager has been much more apologetic, but my expectation is always that customer service comes from the original POC with the customer.<//review>

Waited > 30 minutes to be picked up from AAA. What bothers me is they kept giving updates that they will be there in "a couple of minutes" to pick me.

And after that, they didn't have a car ready for me. Gave me an un-vacuumed car, when they had other cars in parking lot, ready to go!

And when I mentioned it's been over an hour since I have been waiting for car, I got back a smug "I know".

Very disappointed!</text>

<Text>customer service was poor and they gave me a very old car with a battery in bad shape! I rented the car for three weeks and the battery went dead after 2,5! the technical guy did not believe how bad the battery was! and when I came to exchange cars they almost did not believe me! I had to go to sj airport. Don't come to this Hertz!! go to the airport close by!!< /Text>< Date>

Worst service. It took an hour to pick up a car that we reserved online. Discourteous staff, at the very least. They barely had any cars. I would give it 0 stars if I could.</Text>

<Review>Avoid this location. Had to wait for over an hour even though I had a confirmed reservation from my insurance company. There was just one woman, Cherrise,  helping everyone and she had to do everything right from inspecting cars retuned by people and even vacuuming and washing the cars before renting it to someone. At one point I started knocking on one of the doors in the room and someone came out and said he can't help me because he was in a meeting.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fcb92d1dd92f3:0xb9f7d1e23ccdd8ea</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I found Posh & Polished with a google search and decided to give them a try. And I was not disappointed!  The staff are friendly, courteous and accommodating. I was able to get an appointment the next day.  They did my manicure and pedicure at the same time, all while I sipped a glass of wine! They helped me choose colors, and I’m so excited to show off my nails at my wedding tomorrow! Thank you Posh & Polished!!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I don't know the names of the girls who did my nails but they were both amazing. I got a pedicure and a full set. The only thing I was thrown off about was that the acrylics originally were just going to be plain with nail polish painted on top. I've never done it that way so I asked for the color to be mixed in (not sure what it's called.)
I love how they speak English (no offense to salons that don't) but it's nice to be able to have a conversation. They were both so friendly and did a great job. Prices were reasonable and the place was super clean and they had good music and a funny show on tv. I willl be back!</Text>

There's a good selection of gel polish colors and thru coordinate with regular polish for pedicures. The shop is clean and contemporary in a great location with parking.

Came here with my sister last week and had the best experience ever! The staff are so warm and friendly. I loved the atmosphere, decor and hospitality. My sister and I got out nails done by the Sharon and Tommy and they came out better than amazing. Definitely will become my regular salon. Thank you!!!

P.S the girl who works at the front desk, I’m sorry I didn’t get your name but thank you for tending to me and my sister and for being super friendly!!! 100% recommend this place :)</Review>

Unfortunately I had the worst pedicure and while we had the same rejuvenate pedicure and my sister started 10-15 minutes before me, I finished at the same time. My appointment was for 5:15 and was pushed to 5:45. The lady spent more time walking around the salon than on my pedicure. My niece who is 7 got a better pedi than I did.

<text>This place was worth the 30 minute wait (no stupidly I didn't make an appt)  anyways grabbed a beer at Iron Fist then came back for the European Pedicure and basic manicure (which is not so basic!!!)

The girls were warm and friendly and put me in the chill zone while my services were completed all while enjoying a glass.of wine on the house.

<text>Walked in with no appointment & they got me right in within 5 mins! The receptionist was awesome! So nice and informative! She took the time to explain to me the prices of the said services and the differences between the polishes. She also offered me wine or water! The nail tech was also very professional and nice. I think all said it took less than an hour to get acrylics removed, & a full Mani with my natural nails with gel polish and their price of $38 was pretty competitive! I didn't know about the $2 charge for using a card but I will definitely be back with cash!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80d9536b791a9c51:0xeb7702192aab87fd</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went here becuz my reg spot closed. seemed great! the front desk girl sucks! my manicurist was great, but the front desk girl seems bad for biz. she sat the entire time complaining about her personal problems in front of customers. first she overcharged me 43 dollars for a 28 dollar overlay, which I told her was too much. she had to grab the menu and look at the prices, then still charged me 38 dollars.  $28 for the overlay plus $10 for foot polish that I never had. she charged me for the polish. Seriously, I thought polish came with any manicure service. Then, when I emailed a complaint they sent me a receipt for the correction, but still charged my card $43 dollars. I would rather go to a $20 shop than ever go here again.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Every time I walk into Posh and Polished Nail Lounge I immediately feel spoiled from the moment I’m offered a complimentary glass of their delicious wine to the moment I leave with a fresh new set! They have only the best polish (that actually can survive atleast a month or longer) and can you believe it took my fourth fill for a nail to break? The FOURTH! I was so shocked, now that’s proof of great quality! I have been coming to this salon since January/February of this year and considering myself to be a regular, this is realistically the only business I’m at regular at! I feel so comfortable coming here that I now take my grandmother whenever I get the chance. My grandmother is very particular with her nails and is always happy with their services. All the nail technicians are sweet, the beautiful ladies at the front desk are so welcoming. The owner obviously only wants to offer you the very best!

My best friend took me here to get my nails done the staff is nice and it is clean but I got stuck with a nail technician that seemed to not be not very good the other techs tried to convince me and possibly themselves that she was good I told her what I wanted and before she got too far I stopped her because my nails looked terrible and gave her something more simple to do which she still managed to mess up I expressed several times how unhappy and unsatisfied I was with my nails and when I wanted two of them fixed the young lady wouldn’t come out of the back another tech fixed them for me I’m very disappointed in the work and upset the next day the paint on my nails started chipping off bad if anyone does go here book with bair she’s amazing and does great work I wouldn’t suggest anyone else though<//Review>

I love the gel mani/pedi I get here.  My nail tech is very thorough.  That being said,  scheduling doesn't seem to matter at this salon.  What's the point of making appointments when they are never on time? I make it to appts before scheduled start time to always have to wait far more than 5 minutes,  today would've been 20. Respect people's time.  Don't start on ppl arriving way after their scheduled time if it's gonna screw up everybody else!<//Review>

I booked a gel mani & pedi in white - mani by a older woman, didn't catch her name and pedi by Elizabeth and I liked both of their work. The service felt top notch with complimentary wine or tea. After this visit, I do recommend it. For other 1st time visitors, note that the store front in off of Cesar Chavez and not National where GMaps will send you. I had to call after a few minutes of wandering around the center.  I ended up reading more reviews while I was here and noticed many issues with chipping even with gel so I will check back with an update if anything like that comes up. I hope I won't have to do that! Also, I enjoyed the diversity of the staff! And will add that if the work holds up well, the price point is worth it!<//Text>< pictures>

I originally wanted a marble nail. Called in advance to make sure they had a tech who could do it. The marble looked a mess. The tech even said she didn’t like it. She took it off but by then the black base was still on my nail. Was stuck with getting chrome nail. It also looks a mess and sloppy. Very unhappy, spent 4 hours there and paid $75. Going to The Little Nail Shop to get nice nails. Not happy at all. I added a pic too :(< /review>

Posh & Polished is a shiny surprise in Barrio Logan. I went last night with a friend. Never heard of it til the previous day and I am so so glad I did! They do an AMAZING job. Everyone that works there is incredibly sweet. My friend and I are definitely going back!
Did I mention the complimentary wine?! And they are generous. Truly a pampering  experience.
The owner has a pup named Milo who is the cutest lil thing! Be sure to say hi to him.< /text>

The pedicure here is great! You seat in wonderful massage chairs that are comfortable and relaxing. The staff is great and the pedicure prices are in line with other places. The added bonus is a glass of wine 🍷 with your pedicure.< /review>

I got my manicure done and was very disappointed. The lady that did my nails didnt even use a nail cutter, a nipper or the pusher to clean my cuticles. She used the sander and a small scissor to cut my nail. No cuticle was removed. My nails looked like I painted a room and didnt get all the paint off my hands. She also left old nail polish that you could see through the French tips.  I'll post the pictures of the work done. This was worth $70. They added 3 fake nails. Most of it were my real nails. Gel, acrylic and French tip. I understand it all adds up. But to pay $70 for work like this was disappointing.< /text>

{'time': 1558302247599, 'text': "Hey love! I wasn't able to reach out to you privately but I just wanted to touch base with you about your review. I would first off like to say I'm sorry for the confusion, but unfortunately Acrylic services do not include a Manicure. That is a separate service entirely that would have to be requested in addition to the Fill that was booked, as to why you might have noticed she did not use a nail clipper, nipper, or pusher. Cuticle is typically an additional charge for fills or full sets, but they do use the acrylic drill to remove cuticle before filling, so I apologize that that wasn't reiterated for you. Sometimes the cuticles can become dry as well as it appears in the photo which can happen from having acrylics on for a while. I would love to have you return, since these photos don't show the salons full potential. If you have anything that needs to be fixed please contact us at your earliest convenience so we can repair what is needed at no charge :) We do not want you to be left with a poor opinion of our Salon or our nail technician!\n\nHope to hear from you soon,\n\nPosh & Polished Management"}</resp>

<Text>Went there Saturday for a pedicure and wasn't very pleased. The technician rushed at the end and left my fingers stained with nail polish, the callus remover was not very good AND i had to go back the next day because my Gel nail polish came off withing less than 4hrs of getting my pedi done. Went back Sunday got the same nail tech and found out that she didn't even know how to remove the gel polish. Ended up with a cut on my toe from filling my nail hard. The end result was messy and had nail polish on my toes again. Very upset about it :(.  I payed $45+ for this.<//Text>< date>

<rating>4</rating><Text>I was so glad to have had Daniel give me a pedicure, which was all I was going in for but, he was so darn good, I went ahead and got a manicure as well.

Do yourself, your hands and feet a favor and go get a manu & pedi from Daniel. He really knows his stuff. He takes his time, gives an excellent foot massage, and is sweet, gracious & professional! He comes from a line of manicurists, as his parents own a salon in Illinois. I could really tell Daniel loves what he does and cares about his patrons. I look forward to my next "Daniel, mani/ped!".

(I would've given the salon 5 stars, but did not care for the two huge TV in screens right in front of my face, nor their content. How about sone nice relaxing music instead? One goes to a salon to relax, i could watch tv at home if that's what I was in the mood for). Thank you.< /Text></record>

Very  nice. It is fun for kids,  the remodeled the playground so now there is more for Toddler's to play on. You can BBQ hangout out and play. Its in a residential area so it nice clean and peaceful. They also have a swimming pool if you want to take kids for swim lessons or just to splash around for a while. Its fun! One more thing, you won't die if you go there in the evening.<//review>

What a great little hidden park. Swings, slides, sand, play structures. Great shade. Bathrooms a couple BBQs, picnic tables. And a city pool, not sure though when it can be used.</Review>

Small and well maintained park with an excellent pool & community room. I love to take my Kindle and relax under the mature trees on the thick grass and read the afternoon away.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>When living nearby in the late 80's and going to elementary and middle school we would go there to play in the playground there. They had this metal flying saucer with encased vertical stairs directly underneath to get you to the TALL metal slides that would give you 1st and 2nd degree burns in the summer. Good times. Good times. They don't make playground equipment like that anymore sadly. That's what I think is part of the problem with todays youth. LOL< /review>< pictures>

<userid>103788567860064899265</userid><review>I don't normally take to much time for reviews, but I had to on this experience. I will say I was a bit annoyed at the process of signing up, very slow, but I needed a fridge and this was my only option. Once all said and done the process was painless and finally after 2 weeks the fridge arrived tonight.
The delivery drivers is my main reason for this post. They went absolutely above and beyond for me tonight. I was almost in tears because this fridge almost didn't fit and they weren't sure it could be done. Thankfully they took the extra time and made it work. You have no idea how bad this would have been if it didn't fit. I didn't get their names, but THANK YOU!!!! if I could have tipped them a major amount of money I would have. What I had doesn't even come close to showing my gratitude. That's why I'm hoping this review will be seen by the boss and he knows how amazing these guys are.</review><response>{'time': 1577651722880, 'text': 'We are happy to hear that!

The delivery system was really messed up. They didn't have any of the electronics like 55 inch TVs and xbox ones not even in their boxes. And the tv was broken during delivery and the driver lied and said he plugged it in and tested it when he didn't  I give then 0 stars<//Review>

<Text>Horrible company to work for, misleading to its employees. Was going to move my niece, her husband and two young kids to arcata (somewhere they have never lived or know anyone there) to run a store that was closing down in 3 months which is something they did not inform them, thankfully they caught on and confronted management about it because my nieces husband and family would’ve been left with no job in 3 months probably no home in a place they have never lived nor know anybody there. Will never do business with Aaron’s again.<//Text>< rating>

I have bought a washer and dryer from Aaron's and paid it off. This time i took advantage of the 25 payment for a month on a 2 piece sectional. That was 2 weeks ago, I have called a couple time and still have not gotten my couch. What a deal they are offering, 25 dollar payment for one month but they fail to mention you will not get your stuff or if at all. Now i need to get my money back and try Rent A Center to see if they actually value customers.

UPDATE: Just to update, i went in for my refund and the manager at Aarons took care of that long wait with a sectional set delivered that day. So i do appreciate him making that right, it goes a long ways for the consumer.</Text>

I was helped by two ladies.  the lady with longer dark hair had called me her "babe"
I would like to state that not only did she know I am married, but this was EXTREMELY unprofessional.
She has made not only I, but my wife uncomfortable.
I will be asking for a different representative anytime from now on.
I had no clue such unprofessionalism was allowed.
I am currently waiting for a delivery, and I hope that you take note to this and help us avoid coming in contact with this employee.
I have never experienced this disrespect from a employee, this definitely caught me off guard.<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My husband and I purchased a big screen tv and entertainment system on credit and were making 250 dollar payments monthly. Last tax season we paid the debt off in full, but now they are claiming that we are 600 dollars behind and that we owe for 16 months still. I am so upset with them. Keep proof of your payments because they obviously can’t keep their records straight< /Review>

<Review>I actually really like this place because the food is very tasty.  But I can't let today go, I put in an online order before 5:00 p.m. and after arriving 10 minutes after it was supposed to be done I find out it's still 20 minutes before the food will be done with part of the order sitting there waiting.  I find that pretty unacceptable.  Again, the food is great but you may not want to use their online ordering as it is very deficient. It will have been over an hour for 12 pieces of chicken and five roll tacos...

Since I had plenty of time to talk to other folks while waiting, I found out this one couple put their order in online at 3:30 supposed to be ready for 5:15 and I was still waiting with them while doing this review at 5:50...<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Some say hidden spots are the best, well EPG Otay is the Place. El Pollo Grill is the first place as you drive into otay mall. Next to jersey mikes. Special parking for EPG customers in parking lot very convenient. I  Ordered tacos 2 types (carne asada & pollo chariado) completely satisfied and salsas here are fire. Tortillas are soft and tasty. Carne Asada on point. The chicken taco was so good I wanted another even though they are full sized tacos. These are not your tiny little tacos. Beer on draft was a special plus. Calidad on draft oh wow. The outside patio was very comfortable with TVs playing.  Highly recommend otay eartlake tacos the best</review><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1617309577574</date><user_name>Victor Fer< /user_name>< Pics>

<Text>I wish I could give this place five stars and would like to but the customer service is not the best and it is such a let down. Every time I go in the morning for their breakfast burritos (which are the best), they don’t look friendly or look like they wanna work. They look like they’re still waking up. Every time the burritos taste different either they didn’t take off what I asked them to take off or they just don’t ask and assume. One time, I had to wait like 20 minutes when I ordered by phone and there was only one order ahead of mine and they had just opened. Not even a welcome or a smile it is like they could care less if you get food from them or not.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80d945f55aaf0947:0xc0f9f83650621996</Gmap_id>< user_id>

Delicious chicken!

Sometimes they don't wrap my chicken walnut salad in a burrito sized tortilla anymore. The first time they did it and 3x afterwards the other workers said they couldn't. Inconsistent customizations make it hit or miss. Also not sure why but their fish burritos got really salty.

Family chicken meals are always a good go to!

If their customizations stay consistent I'd add the 5 star. Otherwise it's one of our go to Mexican food restaurants in the area.< /Review>

Not only was it the worst service but also the worst customer service.  We placed a over the phone order for pick up and they said it was going to be about 30 minutes due to them being very busy. We get there 10 minutes prior and waited in line to pay and was told the order was still not ready. Fine, no problem. We waited inside for them to call our number and finally after having waited 25 minutes, we asked “what’s going on with our order?”  One of the girls had the nerve to look us in the face and say “we were calling out the numbers, you probably didn’t hear.” Are you freaking serious! We’ve been standing here the whole time waiting and NO ONE was calling out the numbers. Will definitely NOT be going back and the worst part, also got cold food! So disappointing!<//Review>

I'm so happy that El Pollo Grill has come to Chula Vista. I have been going to their Bonita location but it is far away from my home and parking is not ideal. Their Chicken is great. I will be here often< /Review>

EPG Eastlake has a delicious menu and epic friendly staff.  We eat EPG at LEAST once a week and they never disapoint. The food has consistant high quality.  Kids eat free Mondays with the purchase of a meal (children must be present). The owner of EPG is well-integrated with the community and has given back to famililies, supported local sports teams, and is considerate of customers.<//Review>

<Review>The food is generic and over priced would come back if it wasn't for the health code violations. The women there are touching your food, sauces, and containers with long acrylic nails FECAL MATTER ALERT no gloves!! Anyone that serves food to others and has acrylic nails MUST wear gloves. This is how people get Hep-A and food poisoning 🤢🤮< /Review>< userid>

They completely and utterly lied about a food challenge they offer. If you are a good challenger do not try it! They gave me something way more big than they advertised and wouldn’t let me record them making it. Overall food was ok however they try to scam you on the challenge. Still won though!</Review>

<Review>Great everytime. We've only ever had chicken burritos and carne asada burritos, they are both good but I'd say the chicken is the best both asada and shredded; afterall that is their specialty. I recommend getting the build your own burritos and chosing everything in it!! All the salsas are great too.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

used to place large orders with fellow coworkers for lunch. none of us will ever return after the owners tirade about our president. (he said he hoped he would die). I dont appreciate politics as a side with my food, you just alienated customers of yours with your hate and intolerance. will not be back to that ignorant establishment.</Text>

< review>
El Pollo Grill in Otay Ranch impressed me. I had visited this location once before but don’t remember what I ordered. This time I was with family and we ordered a variety of entrees on a Tuesday. I ordered the California burrito and I loved it! The portions were generous and the tortillas are soft and exactly how I expect a flour tortilla to taste. The rest of the family shared carne asada chips, chicken rolled tacos, beef tacos, and chicken tacos made with corn tortillas. The sauces were good, but the habanero hot sauce was my favorite! It has the amount of heat and flavor I crave for a burrito, or any Mexican Food. The service was great and the restaurant was clean and organized. Leilany was the person who helped us at the register. She was very patient with us, and friendly as well. Everything went as smooth as possible thanks to her attention to detail. I will be back for sure!  Eat up!!<//review>

We ordered a carne asada burrito salty and to much guacamole and sour creme. I ordered a beef taco hardly any beef, what was there the beef was dried out and hard. I asked to add guacamole and sour creme and I got none and the taco was soggy and broke. The el pollo grill in Bonita is much better!</Text>

< review>
My son (13) got food poison after eating the 2 Quesadillas from The APPETIZER PLATTER July 22nd,2020 Otay Rach Mall Location, he start with stomach pain minutes after dinner time and fiver, 3 days it has been after this incident and he still recovering, had to take him to Rady's C.H. for a COVID Test to despite he is not infected after EPG Visit since fever and stomach issues are some of the symptoms. The Quesadillas (2) looked very greasy at the time. We called EPG to ask if more people called with the same issue but Manager wasn't around to answer questions, we let them know there's something not working right at the Kitchen or following protocol (could be old produce been served), their food it just to be good, lately my last 2 orders NOT enjoyable at all, just be careful if order quesadillas, I hope management take's care of this concern.
Very unfortunate to lost a customer after my son's incident. (Still waiting for Covid Results)<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I was very surprised on how amazing this place was.

We have a relative that was in town and wanted to make sure she got her fix of anything she wanted that is not available to her in Hawaii.  She wanted Mexican food so this was close by and we wanted to try it cause it had a dining room.

When we arrived it was not busy at all.  No one in line, tables were empty.  I was kind of worried.  We ordered several things and then sat down.  All I can say is wow.  First off, there are plenty of TVs and I was able to watch the NBA game I wanted to.  The soft drinks are serve yourself which means you can get refills, WORTH IT.  Bathrooms were clean and accessible.  They also have beer available if you want to drink.

NOW THE FOOD.  We ordered rolled tacos, the carne asada family meal and a fish burrito.  EVERYTHING WE ORDERED WAS ON POINT!!!  One thing I have an issue with when it comes to my family is that my kids eat A TON.  So when the meal came and it was enough for all of them to eat and be full, that was my favorite thing.  The rolled tacos were topped with ALL the toppings and they were delicious.  The fish burrito was delicious.  The hot sauce was SO GOOD.  They have several levels and their HOT HOT hot sauce was not hot just for the sake of being spicy.  It was delicious and still had a good heat to it.

WE WILL BE BACK!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Asked for a simple order with no guacamole or sour cream and was treated to a poorly wrapped burrito with both of those. Won’t be coming back here anytime soon.</text>

<date>1574474354466< /date><rating>4< /rating><Text>I’ve now been here twice to try two staple items. Both times I got the build your own burrito. First time I figured I’d try the pollo asado because, after all, it’s a chicken place. To be honest, I wasn’t too impressed with the actual chicken taste. It was kind of just meh. The value, however, fantastic. You get to pick your meat and then you choose what you want inside. You get to pick from guac, sour cream, rice, refried beans, cheese, salsa, and FRIES!! And if you want, yes you can have all of it.

Second time I got the carne asada version. Much better and tastier. Kinda weird for a chicken place but 🤷‍♂️

Also, not sure if it’s just the luck of the draw, but both times the cashier process took forever. Need to open up more registers when there’s a line!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Time>1508682282999</Time><Review>A quick stop on your drive up, this overlook gives you a chance to look and learn about Lake Crowley. There's plenty of space to pull over and not be close to traffic though you can't walk anywhere else. Definitely worth checking out if you happen to be driving around close to sunrise/sunset!</Review><GmapID>0x8095fe1a764a37d7:0x6aac29967d10212<//GmapID><user>100994724195802557114< /user>< pics>

There isn't a lot to like or dislike here.  The view is nice but not so much amazing.  Stop and stretch your legs if you need to.  There will never be a postcard made from this place.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) A view of the Long Valley Caldera from the past volcanic eruptions and the later Crawley Lake.

Crawley Lake, which appears to be caldera, is said to have erupted past volcanic ash from more than 1,000 miles to Texas. Imagine a tremendous amount of ash covering the sky and no sunlight, so there is no disaster.

It is a place where you can feel the freshness of the long trip with the cool breeze and the panoramic view. It's also a good idea to stretch and look out at the view and even sign up.

(Original)
과거 초대형 화산 폭발로 생긴 롱밸리 칼데라와 이후 생성된 크롤리 호수를 조망할 수 있는 곳.

칼데라 지형인 것으로 보이는 크롤리 호수는 과거의 분출로 이곳의 화산재가 1,000마일을 넘어 텍사스 주에서 까지 발견되었다고한다. 어마어마한 양의 화산재가 하늘을 뒤덮고 햇빛이 안들어올 장면을 상상하니 재앙이 따로 없다.

지금은 시원한 바람과 탁 트인 조망으로 오랜 여행의 지침을 환기하고 개운함을 느낄 수 있는 곳. 스트레칭하며 조망을 바라보고 안내판까지 보는 것도 추천할 점.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This lake next to the road can be seen thanks to a Parador located right next to it.
This lake of volcanic origin was formed due to a large explosion thousands of years ago. Despite being located next to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, there is a difference of about 2000 meters from the highest point to the lake. The water of this and other lakes in the area is used by the neighboring villages and by the cattle of the calf farms so typical of this territory.

(Original)
Aquest llac al costat de la carretera es pot observar gràcies a un parador ubicat al costat mateix de la mateixa.
Aquest llac d'origen volcànic fou format a causa d'una gran explosió fa milers d'anys. Tot i estar ubicat al costat de la serralada de Sierra Nevada, des del punt més alt fins al llac hi van uns 2000 metres de diferència. L'aigua d'aquest i altres llacs de la zona es utilitzada pels pobles colindants i pel bestiar de les granges de vedelles tant típiques d'aquest territori.<//Text>

Great place to get a personal loan and the best part is that you don’t need a colateral like other loan places. The whole process took no more than 30 mins tops,  just make sure to have all your paperwork ready for faster service.  I will definitely will be using and recommending this business location to family and friends.<//review>

I walked up to get a personal loan and the two employees were having a conversation and it seemed like I was bothering them. This is not how to treat a customer. Extremely unprofessional company.<//text>

Waste of time. The lender advertises unsecured loans to help establish credit within the Hispanic community - specifically targetting immigrants and those with no or low credit. They will bait and switch with attractive offers in their mailers stating that no credit check is necessary and that you're prequalified. Then you will go through a lengthy documentation process where they will bother personal references which is fine, but then when the loan offer comes in it will be substantially less credit than you anticipated. Because of their lengthy process and the hassle to any of your references, it's easier in most cases to build credit with a low limit credit card.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service, my loan took some time for some adjustments in terms, but Gabriela A. It was super effective in following up, all the girls in the branch super friendly and always attentive to all customers! They should train the call center to be as effective as the girls in the store !! Thank you for all your support! Nice to come to this branch

I love this place! I drive about 35 minutes from Tracy just to come here! The value for extremely professional nail art is worth every dollar and more! A wife and husband that own this place are courteous and patient. The husband is a brilliant nail artist!I would recommend this place to everyone</review>

< Review>
Meh! As one of the more expensive walk-in nail salons, I expected better. I don’t understand why they clip the side of my nails. I was very clear I wanted it straight across. NT nails does this as well. I get ingrown nails easily - very annoying. He had me sit under the fan too soon and it created bubbles.</Review>

The price and the service are great ! Sometimes I have to remind the technician to clean up the nails after they’ve painted which is why I gave them four stars but overall you can’t beat the price in California.</review>

Unfortunately I didn't enjoy my nails after getting them done here. They did a great job with my baby sister's nails, but not mine. The paint was uneven, lumpy and easily marked. They didn't clean up underneath so it looks slightly choppy.
I just had them removed today at a different salon after two weeks.< /text>

Consistent and good quality. They do not push or pressure you, stay mostly on schedule. I am a repeat customer here and never leave feeling disappointed.</Text>

They really playing costumers... the phone I wanted turned out to have a much higher  price at the register than displayed, and the employee said it was because paying in full cash was more expensive than paying in installments..?? Turned out the phone I was about to buy isn’t the one I picked out. Not coming here again anytime soon</text>

I walked in to this T-Mobile store a wonderful young man with the name of Leopoldo asked me if he could help, you can't imagine I was happy to hear that, I had couple of issues he solved it for me he made my day, I'm 68 yrs old helpless. He's a wonderful addition to your store. Big thank you to Leopoldo. God bless.< /Text>

horrible service ! I went to do a trade in and asked to get the Iphone 11 green mint && employee said they don’t make that color . Only iphone11 pro had that color . Then she kept on giving me incorrect information. If you work at a t-mobile! learn the facts!<//Review>

I like this place. David helped me. He answered all my questions and concerns without being condescending. I had been at two other T-Mobile's today and  the service was really not as good. So my advice is to ask for DAVID‼️😀</text>

I have to agree that even the so-called "managers" are rude. She rolled her eyes at me! That is beyond unprofessional. I can't wait for the day when these workers are replaced by a simple kiosk that can do their job 100 times better than they can.</Text>

***LIARS!!***
Came in to get in on the bogo galaxy promotion. We needed to open a new line so we opened one for a family member. That family member had unlimited calling to mexico and wanted to keep that. We asked if that was the case and they assured us it was. Well they LIED and now we have to add it at an extra cost.< /Text>

Horrible customer service. Came in for help with a defective battery on my phone so they did a warranty exchange on my note 4 and I asked if I was going to get a new battery the rep said yes. The day it came in it was a refurbished phone with no battery and a messed up speaker that buzzes when the volume is higher than the half way point. Now they're telling me they can give me another refurbished phone. Still won't give me a battery or I have to go through Samsung<//review>

<Text>HORRIBLE customer service. I went in there a couple of days prior and bought a new phone with a new line. I came in today and the manager Crystal helped me because I had questions about the lines and rudely told me we can't help you. I needed to call T-Mobile. I came in for customer service and instead I got attitude. Never again.</Text></record>

Worst Customer Service I have ever got in my life! The assistance Manager has a attitude I had a problem and while talking to her she answered a call and she was talking about how some guy was bringing her Starbucks very unprofessional . Then I go in to purchase a Tablet and the guy who sold it to us , said nothing was going to change on my account and completely lied to us . I Ended having a bill of 500$ . I have been with t-mobile for more than a year and My bill has never been more than 180 this guy made my bill go to 500 without telling us why. Never stepping into that store again and if I do I'm recording them from now on. BRING IT.</text>

I don't like this store at all
Extremely poor customer service, the manager said to me ( is this all you need ? So I can get back to what I was doing )
Also the sales rep Patty did  not do her part in the paperwork for my early termination fee.
when I switched over from verizen.
I never received the 300.69 dollars in which I had to pay from my own pockets.
The assistance manager is tipickle la lat with a tipecal teen attitude bubblegum chewing at that also
Tmoble where is my early termination fee my
300.69 dollars it's Ben a year now, and after arguments and more arguments over the phone.maybe I'll call channel seven ant let people know what's going on.
Let's turn this location into a Starbucks store</Review>

Horrible tmobil store the guy working there is a very unprofessional. I was trying to buy an iphone 6s and he qouted me 360... At first so i drop the 360 and he then type in a few more things and then bumped up the price to $512. I questioned him asking why did it just go from 360 too 512 and his response was mute.  Not wanting to put up with this i left the store with money in hand. A couple days later i had traveled to the store in carson off avalon n the 405 freeway. I got qouted $318 but unfortunately they only had the color pink. No bueno tmobil.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Online waiting more than an hour. The staff showed no interest in providing good service. It was practically getting rid of the client so he could close up and leave. Personally lousy service.

Finally back open! A fun little museum with something really special. All of the cars are drivable and on Sundays they picked select few and you can get rides in the cars! Check out the website for which cars will be giving rides the Sunday you go! There are a lot of cars to see, many unique and special! They also have an ice cream shop inside. A great place to take your kids who love cars!!! You must check it out!<//text>

Awesome little car museum in the middle of El Segundo! The volunteers are super friendly, and it's just a really nice atmosphere. The collection of cars is really varied with some unique examples from the early twentieth and even late nineteenth century. Worth a free visit, especially with the family.</Review>

I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Super friendly staff, they let you touch and sit in the museum vehicles, give rides on weekends, and hold awesome events. If you're in the area you need to check the Automobile Driving Museum!

Forgot to mention, you can rent this museum for events. I litterally proposed to my wife here. I cant stress enough, this is an AWESOME museum!

<review>Fantastic museum with some very rare cars. Great friendly staff members who are all volunteers. They all had great knowledge of the vehicles and there passion showed.
Entry is via a donation and $15 is the recommended amount. Worth ever dollar and then some.< /review>< Rate>

A nice break from waiting in the airport. Only 10 minutes from the terminal. Good collection of American classics.  Looks like a unique spot for car-themed events too.< /text>

<review>Really awesome car museum. Not super big but has a lot to offer. Super friendly staff and has a cute little cafe with yummy ice cream and snacks. A great place to take kids has a little hot wheels area for them. Cute finds in the gift shop. Coolest part is you can get inside the cars!<//review>< user>

I went for the kit car show, so I didn't even go inside the museum.  Easy to find and parking off-street was no problem on a Sunday.  Free admission was nice too.  Pretty good participation (30+ entrants) for such an eclectic show.<//Review>

Fun place to visit  you can get up close and personal with pieces of history.  Besides the museum, they have events there quite frequently. From what I understood, they also have youth activities to get them interested in STEM.< /review>

This was an unbelievable stop if you are a car enthusiast! We had a blast! Only car museum I’ve ever been to where you can get in and touch the cars. It is a complete nonprofit so your donation is well worth it!!</Review>

< Review>
Absolutely fun place for people who appreciate the artistry and beauty of classic cars. You can even get behind the wheel of most of the cars on the showroom floor.  Some real special vehicles lovingly maintained by their owners.< /Review>

<review>First time coming to this musuem, awesome...great atmosphere at the annual trunk or treat event, my six year old really enjoyed it and looking at the old cars. The chance to ride in the older cars is also awesome although we didn't do it because my son is too small at the moment. Fantastic touch is the ice cream parlor...will come back again.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Very nice curated selection of vehicles from many eras. Has a showroom for pristine condition and I assume for sale vehicles that is separate from the pictures below. Museum curators were very well informed and were delighted to provide me with some history on these vehicles. All in all we all had fun and if you enjoy cars is worth a visit. Short drive from LAX.< /Review>< GmapID>

<review>$10 entry with fun for the whole family. You can sit in almost any car and lots of fun extras (a labeled engine cutout that you can crank and see how it works). Recommended for any car guy - mostly American classics with a Porsche, a Delorean and some English classic roadsters. The staff were friendly and courteous and I had a great time with my girlfriend. Would recommend to any car or history person.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
This is a fantastic place to come on a Sunday. They take a few models out in front and the staff will take you for a drive in some awesome classics! The inside of this place is also amazing. We had a great guided tour of all the cars and the shop where they maintain them all. Come here and check out some great automobile history!<//Review>

Super cool that you can touch and get in the cars! They really have some beautiful classic cars! And they even have a cute little ice cream parlor! They are based on donations for entry, which is great if you are on a budget... They have a little play area for kids with a cool Hot Wheels set up with tons of cars to play with, coloring papers/crayons, and even a little TV that plays cartoons. They also host parties in a banquet room!<//text>

Great museum with a twist. It's one of the only museums I've been to that encourages you to touch, open, and sit in just about any of the cars in their collection!  Awesome selection of cars from the early 1900s up through the late 80s or early 90s, domestic and foreign. Did the whole thing in under 2 hours and that was reading about most of the cars. Great way to kill a couple hours near LAX. Highly recommend!</review>

<review>I went during the "free-for-all" event so not everything was available. However, I saw that the entrance fees were absolutely affordable. Every Sunday they choose a couple of cars from their collection for visitors to drive. Their Ice Cream parlour is a delight and all the cars are remarkable. Do not worry if you are not a car fan, their collection is impressive and you will certainly be amazed. Definitely should be on everybody's bucket list.< /review>< Pics>

Better than expected. Volunteers knew their stuff. Free rides in whether a 50s, 60s, 70s car.
They have special events different  months of the year.< /Review>

Alot smaller then I expected but they had a variety of cars to look at. There are guys there that can give you some cool facts about the cars. It was a nice way to pass the time before our flight home.</review>

Absolutely love this place. The docents are so nice and informative. The layout by time periods is really well done. And you can even get in most of the cars with docent approval. Wonderful for the whole family.<//Text>

These are some really well-maintained cars from the early 20th century. Well worth the journey. There's an ice cream shop to spend some time in after you've taken a gander at these beautiful classic cars.<//text>

Absolutely love this place. The docents are so nice and informative. The layout by time periods is really well done. And you can even get in most of the cars with docent approval. Wonderful for the whole family.< /review>

What a treasure! If you can go on a Sunday afternoon, be sure and make a reservation to take a ride in one of their historic cars. Each week they choose three different classic automobiles and will give rides. Otherwise  there is an excellent display of a variety of classic cars and usually a volunteer or two who will show you around and answer any questions. The gift shop is well priced and has some nice souvenirs. And there's actually in ice cream shop which makes a delightful stop even if you aren't interested in automobiles.</Text>

Solid collection of American vintage cars. Some are more esoteric than they are culturally significant, so keep that in mind.

They're all crammed in a single room, which might make appreciating some of them difficult-- hard to take in the beauty with another car three feet away on two sides.

I waver on 3* or 4*, but I'm feeling generous... and the location is great-- perfect for a quick visit from LAX if you have a few hours' layover, but not enough time to venture all the way to the Petersen!</review>

Great place to visit and bring families, friends, or a date. Didn’t know this one existed here in LA...what a Diamond. I love that you can actually be so close to the cars, even ride , or drive some of the classics. My kiddos appreciated it  a lot and understood the value of cars based on quality and time. Oldies but Goodies!< /review>

<Text>Went to meet up with friends from Riverside & Pasadena. Our Pasadena friends couldn't make it! Yet we still enjoyed the museum.

Their was a car show today. Muscle cars from the 60's, 70's, 80's & a very few newer model hi performance cars. Now, this is not a large show. Take away the museums cars & maybe there was 35 cars. So unless your a big car fan, probably not for you.

All the cars were terrific & the owners prides showed through.

One nice component of the museum, if it's the museums car, you can get, sit down & check it out.

For me it was coming all of 15 minutes from Redondo, so no issues. My friends from 80 miles away, we're a little disappointed, understandably so. But they still enjoyed their day.

If your local, go. If your coming from 30 miles plus, i'd wait till they have a large show.<//Text>< name>

Terrific collection of classic cars, bolstered by excellent events for both kids and adults. Check out the Hot Wheels garage, and don't miss the "Sunday Drives" that allow you to ride the neighborhood as passengers in the Museum's well-maintained vehicles. Close to LAX airport, making it a good destination for a layover visit.< /text>

10/10 awesome place. I wish I knew the name of the guy at the front desk. He was super nice, talked to me about the cars showed me around, took pictures of me in the cars, talked to me about how the museum works and how some cars are borrowed from owners, and was just an overall helpful guy.
You can tell he loves his job.
It’s people like this that make businesses a better business and should valued by their employers. 10/10 made my experience a good and memorable one. It makes me want to take my girlfriend here with me next time I go to Los Angeles.<//text>

What a gem! You get to sit in the cars as well as look at them! On Sundays they have 3 different cars you can ride in. Nostalgic! Friendly docents too.</review>

Wow, a large selection of classic cars. You can sit in most of them and we had assistance from a very knowledgeable volunteer. They had very good Ice Cream, we very much enjoyed it.</Review>

<text>This place absolutely rocks! Super friendly staff and perfect to take your young car enthusiast who will be allowed to sit and "drive" all the cars that aren't a loan. From early fords to slick Dodge Challengers it's a great place even has a old time great ice cream shoppe inside so you don't get too hungry after your pretend races<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

In most car museums, you can't touch the cars, but here you can sit in almost all of them! It's great for parents with children since kids always want to touch!

Also, the gift shop is great! I'm happy they sell hot wheels cars there because sometimes museums only have high ticket items which means I end up with my son crying, or myself crying, all the way home.<//Text>< pictures>

Our revolutionary school Angeles Workshop School goes on a field trip every week, and loved our visit to the ADM! Our tour guide Jim was simply amazing! He's full of energy and interesting information, and has a wonderful, active rapport with young people. Oh, and the cars are awesome too: a really wide collection!< /Text>

I'm a long-time car guy, and while this place has some interesting vehicles, it's not nearly as diverse as one might expect, and unfortunately it has no flow. One big room, with a second that requires a chaperone (docent), with cars packed in haphazardly. There is very little history or much of any real information on the cars themselves (mostly because they are drivers, and they allow you to gently crawl around in them), which would help the experience. It is a non-profit, and admission is suggested donations, but I would have liked to see a little more than a garage full of cars. Still, for what it is, I'm really glad it's there, we need more of this.< /review>

What an amazing place this is you not only get to look at beautiful historic cars from all eras but you actually get to touch them sit in them and on Sundays drive them with a designated driver it's a great experience to see the Past come to life< /Text>

Nice place. Has the classics and some rare cars. Close to the airport, hence if you've got an extra hour to kill before your flight, worth checking out.< /Review>

There is DeLorean car, which I always wanted to see in my own eyes, and other classic cars, and even a replica(?) of first car!! It was really great place to visit.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Really disappointed that we arrived in LA with limited time and caught an Uber here, only to find it closed at 12.30 on a Friday for a private event. There was nothing on the website or when I called to indicate this was the case.<//review>

<text>Very interesting, not overwhelming.  Docents all over to help you with any questions.  Very nice staff.  Went on a Sunday which is when they take cars out, so we took three different car rides (free).  They ask an entry donation as they are a non-profit of $10 each for adults.  Well worth every penny to help keep the cars running.  All the cars there registered and are for "driving".  They even allow you to get in the cars on the museum floor.  If you've ever wondered how it feels to climb into the driver's seat of a Delorean, they have one in the collection.</text><UserId.>106378661744351411853</UserId.>< time>

Very interesting, not overwhelming.  Docents all over to help you with any questions.  Very nice staff.  Went on a Sunday which is when they take cars out, so we took three different car rides (free).  They ask an entry donation as they are a non-profit of $10 each for adults.  Well worth every penny to help keep the cars running.  All the cars there registered and are for "driving".  They even allow you to get in the cars on the museum floor.  If you've ever wondered how it feels to climb into the driver's seat of a Delorean, they have one in the collection.<//Text>

This place is a hidden gem. A car museum where you can actually sit inside many of the antique cars on display. Free rides in select cars on certain weekends. Check it out!</text>

They also have random shows which is what drew us there to begin with.

I'd never seen an Edsel or a Packard until I came to this hidden jewel of a car museum, a genuine afficionado's delight that in some ways puts the Petersen to shame. Everyone should visit so they can get up close to some of the best of American engineering and ingenuity. It gives you hope that this country will get back on track.< /text>

If you find yourself in El Segundo on business with some free time on your hands I would highly suggest stopping by to checkout this great collection of antique cars. Plus you can actually sit in them and touch them. This is not you're average museum! All car Enthusiasts must check it out.< /review>

< text>
The Automobile Driving Museum has its name referring to the very interesting fact that all the cars in the museum are ready to drive on the street. This is quite a challenge to keep all these machines ready for use on the street, Really Amazing. Another point of interest is the note that the museum's admission charge is a recommended donation.  Note only recommended. The autos are in one large room with about eighty cars. There is a glassed in room that visitors are not allowed to enter that houses the ultra rare classics that can be viewed from a distance. There are cars here that are in the Rose Parade each year, cars that  have carried dignitaries and even one customized Packard Pickup conversion. I found the quality quantity and condition of all the cars to be excellent. After talking to one of the docents I learned that they had several cars on loan from the Peterson Museum. Quite an honor to have loaners from such a prestigious museum. The Automobile Driving Museum also has multiple additional warehouses with several hundred other cars that they rotate into the displays. This makes the museum ever changing and always interesting. Each Sunday they choose three cars and give people rides in the cars. Every Sunday they choose three different cars. Wow! and if you check in with Yelp there is an offer for Free Ice Creams. What a deal! The quality and selection of autos is marvelous and it is a worthy stop for anyone. When I was picking up my son who came in on a flight at Los Angeles International Airport, it was a simple 5 minute drive to pick him up. I found the museum to be a much more satisfying stop than a cell phone parking lot at the airport. So, plan a little extra time into your airport pickup or drop off and enjoy The Automobile Driving Museum. It is another one of the many small museums in beautiful Los Angeles area.<//text>

<Text>Great auto museum. If you want a less overwhelming but great experience come here. The big fancy P auto museum is ok but more expensive and a hassle to get to DWN TWN LA.
This place is great, free easy parking and nice people.< /Text>< date>

<name>Geovanni Ramirez< /name><Date>1523502879786</Date><rating>5<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) It is a great museum, there are many old cars. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in cars. There is a lot of history in this museum. I also think they take free rides on a Firebird trans AM!

(Translated by Google) This museum is very interesting, it always changes part of the old vehicles on display. It has very interesting and rare resident vehicles. Everyone is really nice. It's not huge but it's worth the visit. I've visited this museum many times, I try to fit it into the script whenever I have the opportunity, even for a quick visit.

Esse museu é bem interessante, sempre altera parte dos veículos antigos em exposição. Possui os veículos residentes bem interessantes e raros. Todo mundo é bem agradável. Não é enorme mas vale a visita. Já visitei este museu muitas vezes, tento encaixar no roteiro sempre que tenho oportunidade, mesmo que para uma rápida visita.<//review>
