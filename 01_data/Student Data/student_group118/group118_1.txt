<review>I am in love with Spicy Oil Fish here! It’s the best one I have in SF! I have been searching for a restaurant that severs this particular dish with real Chinese seasoning taste. Well I wasn’t disappointed when I had it tonight. Definitely coming back here.< /review>< Resp>

How they have 4* is beyond me. The gentleman was very rude in answering my simple question. I couldn't understand him because his accent was so strong. I was trying but it just wasn't happening. I had the Seseme Chicken and honestly it was gross. It had a weird flavoring to it and crispy like coating. It was also too much breading and not enough chicken. First impressions were bad for me. I won't be returning.<//text>

This people are rediculous!!! I went to have dinner there after a long day in the city. I asked if I could use the restroom--I had to go very bad! You how it is ladies, right? Well... They told me that I had to order first! There I am standing thers about to urinate in my pants! I had to go to my car open my doors and pee in the publinc in front of Holberton tech school. Did I order dinner? Not from there and I won't ever go there again.<//Text>

I ordered delivery from this restaurant while staying at a SF hotel. The delivery was made in decent time and I enjoyed the food. I ordered spring rolls, green onion pancakes, chicken fried rice and vegetable & dumpling soup. The spring rolls were good, the cabbage pieces inside were plentiful but chopped a bit large for my taste (they would pull out of the roll when you took a bite). But the flavors were good so that wasn't a big deal. The green onion pancake was ok if a bit greasy. The fried rice was very good, I liked the flavors they came up with for it. They didn't have my favorite wonton soup but they had something called vegetable and dumpling soup which was pretty good. There was a lot of bok choy in a chicken broth, and the dumplings were decent. They didn't seem hand made but they were still good. All in all I was pleased with my order and I would order from them again.<//review>

For me, this is the quintessential take-out restaurant. While there are dine-in options and rarely some folks doing just that, it is really not much to look at inside.

We only ever get the traditional Szechuan dish, spicy boiled fish, or 'shui zhu yu'. It is not the best we've ever had, but it is up there. Nicely spiced, a little disappointing on the 'numbing' from the sichuan peppercorns - but made up for in taste, quality of the fish, and a good portion size.

The people that run the place are lovely and accommodating.< /review>

<Text>Home style Sichuan cooking. Mapo tofu is vegetarian. Has mala numbing flavor and salty from preserved black beans and Sichuan broad bean paste. Authentic flavor. Immigrants trying to make it good place cheap. Bokchoy w garlic. You can make up a dish like steamed fish and have them make it.</Text><name>doug chang< /name>< Date>

Spicy Garden is pretty good. Their House Chow Mein had a good amount of meat and vegetables, and their Fried Eggplant was kind of cool (think Eggplant French Fries).

Tip: Order from Eat24 because, 1. You don't want to go to 6th street, and 2. There is no menu online.<//Text>

<Name>Sylvia Lewis<//Name><time>1462214443339</time><Rate>2< /Rate><Review>I ordered delivery (even though I live a block away) after running across the reviews on Yelp. I was so excited! To think, I had lived next to a mecca of delicious spicy Chinese food. I had never wanted to enter due to its relative emptiness and proximity to the porno theater, in addition to the the fecal matter and urine lining the streets that make me lose my appetite.

Maybe I just ordered the wrong items? But here's what I got.
Pork Belly with Garlic and Spice: 0/5. I had expected those lovely tender chunks of pork belly glazed with garlic and spice. YUM. What I got was a soup that was mildly spicy at best with cold, unappetizing thin and chewy pieces. None of the sauce was picked up either - it was very bland.
Kung Pao: 2/5. Whoever wrote this would be so spicy they sweated does not ever do sichuan or Indian. I specifically asked for spicy (two times - once in writing and once by checking "spicy") in the request for delivery. It was bland.
String Beans: 3/5 - Probably the best of the dishes. Dried and pretty spicy.

String beans alone weren't enough to sustain ourselves so my husband and I ended up heating up some Costco linglings potstickers. Those were pretty darn good actually.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I'm a fan. Quality chow mein in SOMA is pretty limited so if you make my chow mein extra spicy as requested then you will get an extra star. Along with the chow mein I ordered the fried garlic eggplant which I really enjoyed. It was pretty much like garlic fries but made with egg plant - unique and interesting to say the least.

Overall it's nearby and decently priced, I will definitely be back.</Text>

First time here and I was impressed. It’s just a torta but it was so good and they also gave me chips with mashed beans. Bomb! The best part was the hospitality. I felt like family. They checked on us multiple times. Salsa was good, jalapeño hot. My go to spot in Van Nuys.< /text>

This is the best Mexican restaurant in the valley. The owners really care about the food and customers. Quality is always top notch and the food is really good. Reminds me of my moms cooking when I was a kid</Review>

I have trusted my families care in Dr. Neal‘s hands for many. There was no doubt in her mind as he opened up his new office we would continue visiting him. This is a great office for the whole family. My children feel comfortable every visit and look forward to seeing him and his staff. The friendly remainder calls, text, and easy scheduling, make it easy to keep up with care for a busy family.< /review>

This was my first time going to a chiropractor in over 10 years.  It was a pleasant experience and I am very happy I went.  Dr Neal and Jennifer are true professionals and I would highly recommend anybody looking for an excellent chiropractor to look no further  and make an appointment.  Thank you and I appreciate your service.  I feel great and will be coming back soon to continue maintenance on my spine.< /text>

Dr. Neal is not like any other chiropractor I have ever seen. Part of his exceptional care is because he uses his physical therapy training to compliment his chiropractic expertise.
Each visit is tailored to what will provide the most pain relief for each patient.
It's amazing to get immediate  relief along with implementing
any maintenance exercises Dr. Neal recommends between visits. Whether you have a chronic pain issue or  have pulled a muscle from over excursion, it's worth making an appointment.</Text>

I’ve been coming to CSC for a few years now and I always leave feeling my best. If you have any back, hip, or neck pain, I encourage you to add chiropractic care to your routine. Dr. Neal is simply the best and will have you back to a pain-free life in no time!<//review>

Was my first time to see a chiropractor. Jennifer & Dr Neal treat you very well. They are professional and take the time to make sure you understand the process and procedure. Dr Neal went over my x-rays in detail to make sure I understood what my issues were. We mapped out a plan to reach our health goals. The office itself is very clean and spacious. Look forward to taking advantage of the massage therapy in the future.</review>

If you are suffering from any back or neck pain this is the place to go. You will walk out feeling much better than when you walked in. I’ve been to many chiropractors in my life and Dr. Neal is one of the best. I highly recommend him.<//review>

Dr. Neal and his team are great. My first experience With Dr was one of desperate need. I pinched a nerve and could barely move from my chest cavity up into my arms and neck. Based on referral and quick background of what’s going on, Dr Neal got me in last minute and I’m so thankful he did. My relief was instantaneous. I could pick up my shoulders, and hold my keys without pain. I didn’t feel like Uncle Fester anymore..this was after a short evaluation and X-ray to determine the causes.
The practice is clean, and staff is upbeat and friendly. If you’re looking for a new chiro, here’s your stop!
The treatment since has been great and I feel amazing. Thanks, Dr!</text>

I've been coming to see Dr. Neal for nearly two years now. I had pretty consistent low back and hip pain. I felt relief immediately following the first adjustment he gave me. Dr. Neal also showed me stretches that I do on my own to keep my hip flexor and fascia loose. The combination of regular adjustments and stretching as kept me pain free.< /Text>

<review>Dt. Neal is a wonderful Chiropractor!!! He’s very gentle, thorough & explains everything, including exercises to help w/a particular problem. Love the various massage “tables” - the one that uses warm water is heaven! He is truly the best Chiropractor that I have ever had & I’m 64 yrs old. I know he will keep me in great shape for the rest of my life. Schedule an appt - he is worth the drive from anywhere in SDCounty.</review>< user_id>

Dr. Neal is without a doubt one of, if not the best chiropractor currently practicing! His knowledge and technical expertise at providing physical relief through adjustments is only matched by his incredible demeanor and dedication to his clients! If you think you need chiropractic or not a trip to CSC will improve your well being.< /text>

<text>I’ve been seeing Dr. Neal for almost a year now and he’s the best! He’s really helped reduce my chronic neck pains and I walk out of each adjustment feeling relieved and ready for the day. The front desk staff are always so wonderful to work with as well. If you want a chiropractor that cares, is super nice, and provides results, go see Dr. Neal!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dbfe335351fda5:0x4e22f54c49c93d25</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I both have been coming to see Dr Neal and Butch for over a year now. We have both had nothing but FANTASTIC experiences.
Dr Neal is the real deal. He knows his stuff and has a great way of explaining the details as we go along. He is a pro, plain and simple. He's been working on my back, neck and arm, and he’s made magic happen! I'm a big fan. I highly recommend Dr Neal to anybody looking for a great Chiropractor. From beginning to end, he will take great care of you!!
Butch is great! He has magic hands. He will find your problem and force it out of your body! He's got incredible strength. Unreal, really. Lots of experience. He knows what he's doing. Most impressed.
Jennifer is outstanding! She keeps me organized and handles all the adult details so I don’t have to! She’s always on top of everything!
All around, this is the best chiropractor/massage experience you can find. I promise!< /review>

Dr. Neal is great! I have been seeing Chiropractors since I was 12 years old and I am incredibly selective when it comes to physical therapists, Massage therapists and Chiropractors. I can easily say that Dr. Neal is by far the most comprehensive and detailed in his approach - so the naming of his practice is literal - he really covers it all and makes sure you don't leave if you are not feeling relief. As a guy with a high stress job, a workout warrior mentality and some scoliosis, I have issues ALL the time and every time I have gone to see Dr. Neal unable to turn my head, to 1 side or sit/stand without major pain and impingement  - I have left feeling imminent relief and within a few visits been back to normal.  On top of being a top-notch chiropractor, Dr. Neal is also a top-notch guy.</Text>

I have been seen by Dr. Neal for over a year now for different injuries I have had and I will not be seen by anyone else! He is so awesome and knows not only what treatment he needs to do for you but also additional treatment at home to help continue healing and prevent further injury! I love that his office calls to see if I need to come in periodically because it shows they care! He is also super fast at getting you in to be seen. Thanks for everything Comprehensive Spinal Care and especially Dr. Neal.</review>

I'm so glad that I found Dr Neal! After months of trying out different chiropractors and not being completely satisfied with any of them, I stumbled across Dr Neal through my insurance company. He is seriously the BEST! If you are looking for a chiropractor that is kind, knowledgeable, and really cares about his patients, look no further.  Dr Neal and his staff will take care of you.<//review>

<Review>Have been seeing Dr Neal for 10 plus years for Chiropractic treatments. He is gentle, professional, and friendly. Always feel brand new after an adjustment.
His office and staff is very comfortable, clean, and welcoming.

<Review>Really love the way Dr. Neal treats everyone - his staff and his patients. He's very nice and good at what he does. I switched from doing regular walk-in adjustments somewhere else to booking appointments with Dr. Neal because I feel it does give me more time to ask questions and get the adjustments I need. Overall fantastic place!<//Review>< GmapID>

<text>Got lucky finding Dr. Neal! After being referred for spinal surgery I gave it a shot and sought chiropractic treatment as an alternative. After seeing two other chiropractors, without any progress, I gave it one last try and was fortunate to find this fella. My first visit provided me  with movement I hadn't had for over a month and hope that surgery would be a passing thought. With continued treatment I have avoided surgical treatment and am confident that i will be able to return to my active lifestyle in the future. Thanks Dr. Neal!!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<date>1578949838598< /date><text>Let me start off by saying saying that I had never been to a chiropractor before and admittedly was a bit hesitant. I have had migraines before 2003 while in the Army that continued well into present day..fast forward to about 6 months ago when I was in an incredible amount of pain and barely able to walk, the pain kind of came out of nowhere. I thought I was just getting old (I'm 38) or that I was out of shape and needed to stretch more...after an MRI the VA diagnosed me with degenerative disk disease in both my neck and lower back... needless to say being barely able to walk and in (an insane amount of) constant pain was having a serious effect on my work and personal life...I couldn't focus and was irritable almsot all the time....the motrin, and gabapentin the VA had prescribed weren't doing much of anything at all. I asked my primary if there was ANYTHING at all they could do to help...I was referred out for Chiropractor services by the VA to Comprehensive Spinal care. The VA rep relayed that they have sent a lot of vets here and had gotten really great feedback from them. From the first visit I was already grateful for the referral and couldn't understand why the VA doesn't offer these services more? Thats another topic though. Since the first adjustment I haven't had anothher migraine (not saying I won't, just saying so far I haven't!) my entire body felt much more relaxed and less tense. Combine the Spinal adjustments with the in house massage/muscle management and the combination has been life changing... even if the VA doesn't provide any more care options I will be continuing to get help via there cash based plan (extremely reasonable, and affordable). They also take most insurances and are extremely happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have. A huge thank you to everyone at the office. Do yourself a huge favor, whether it's back pain, neck pain, digestive issues, numbness in arms and legs....okay you get the point...just call and talk to them...I was shocked at the relief after the first visit...and now after my 4th continue to look forward to the relief provided!</text></record></dataset><record>

I wish I would have found Dr. Neal 9 years ago when I started having back pain. After just one visit my debilitating pain had subsided to almost nothing. And he is incredibly easy to talk with. You owe it to yourself to schedule an appointment with him!<//Review>

Cannot think of another medical professional in any field that I would rather see over Dr. Neal at Comprehensive Spinal Care. He is experienced, passionate, dedicated and personable, and he truly cares about the well being of ALL of his patients. He has treated me for two separate injuries - lower back and shoulder - and I can safely say that I would not be in the condition I'm in (or able to play golf) if it wasn't for his superlative care. I have absolutely no reservations recommending Dr. Neal to anyone in need of anything from full blown rehab, to a simple adjustment.</review>

Worst place ever. Expensive prices for not good quality of food. I gave some indications of how I wanted my meat and they did something totally different.

It was a good costumer service tho. And maybe for others the taste of the food is good so, you decide!< /text>

< Review>
Tried to use my debit card and unfortunately the chip was cracked. The lady at the register told me she couldn’t help me then turned around and walked away in a very rude manner. All she had to do was attempt the chip a few more times and then you default to swiping the card. Never coming around that place again and it has a B rating. Watch out foodies! Steer clear of poor service and that B rating!!!!!!!!</Review>

<Review>The place was empty that should of been a red flag ,but we where hungry and decided to give them a try .. tacos had a weird smell my daughter didn’t even liked them the chorizo taco smelled like fish  and it was so hard to chew the enchiladas I order where literally soggy and the beans smelled like they where made days before .. we left all the food and walked out the only good thing that was good was the soda 🤦‍♀️<//Review><Response>None</Response><Rate>1<//Rate>< pictures>

Loved it
Got a chicken quesadilla combo with rice and beans.
The beans had a large chunk of Mexican cheese, so delicious.
The habanero picked red onions, to the salsas, all top notch.< /Text>

<text>Their grade is a B on the lunch truck, that is the 1st red flag. Suadero Tacos had no flavor, only one salsa available. Limes and radishes looked old and were dry. 4 small Tacos for $9 to be sitting down on a dirty table seems kind of high.<//text>< pics>

Hands down one of my favorite Mexican joints in the valley, perhaps all of Los Angeles. Cruz, the gal who runs the place is super friendly and will often surprise you with a bowl of something she was trying out in the kitchen. Also one of the few places that doesn't look crosseyed at you when you ask for a California burrito. Menudo is awesome. Everything here is great.< /text>

Can't say enough great things about Christina! She is a excellent stylist and makes the whole experience enjoyable. Easy going, attentive and checks in with you to make sure you are happy from start to finish. I am picky about the stylist I go to and I have to say this was one of the best experiences I have had. Thanks again Christina!<//text>

Got a good haircut.  Went from Long ponytail to ivy league for $14 (senior price).  I was more than happy to give her a $6 tip.<//Text>

My Girl freind visit to Beauty By Christina Highly recommended, especially if you have a chance to get your hair cut/coloured by Christina. She's amazing. She's been cutting my hair since 2010 and I haven't changed a stylist since then. My hair looks beautiful and I'm so grateful!< /Text>

This salon is one of the best kept secrets in Woodland hills and Canoga park areas. The stylist are professional and make sure you feel and look like a million dollars when you leave. I've been a loyal customer for over 18 years, and although I've moved away Christina is the only stylist that has touched my hair. Every trip home means a trip to Beauty By Christina Salon Woodland hills and Canoga,Ca< /text>

<Text>Best yelp find ever! Shes amazing. I hadnt cut or shaped my hair since 2011. She made me feel amazing, completely sweet. I got a cut plus deep condition. My hair was so soft afterwards. I will forever be coming back here for a trim or just to get my hair shiny and soft! Honestly it was inexpensive as well.</Text>< Pics>

Love this place.   I've been getting my haircuts here since 2003. Cristina has a wonderful personality and always has company which includes Old Man Albert.

Highly recommend her skills for men's Haircuts. Great fade of Zero on the sides with a trim on the top.< /Review>

< Review>
Kahuna mimosa on Sunday morning... Comes in a pint glass... $10... Totally worth it.

The Avocado Toast was amazing! Definitely good to split with someone. The red pepper flakes add just a bit of zip. I got the Te Mana Toast with a fried egg, and hot damn is it delicious. It's got raisins, onions, pepitas, heaven, love and a dash of amazing flavor.

It's just a peaceful spot in OB to get a lazy Sunday morning breakfast.</Review>

< Review>
First time visit and I gave it 5 stars for the delicious food, coffee, atmosphere and service!!! I ordered the Olu Olu bagel on an everything bun, and it comes with cucumber, spinach, honey, vinaigrette, cream cheese, avocado, and tomato. Plus, an iced Vietnamese coffee, it’s a little on the bitter side; sometimes people make it sweeter so maybe this is just their style. I love the Hawaiian theme, cozy indoor and outdoor seating. Very tidy and beautifully decorated. They had a large menu of sandwiches, salads, plates, smoothies, teas and coffee!! I can’t wait to visit again.</Review>

Got the Hawaiian plate and the Cubano coffee. Definitely worth coming again. The pork had a great smokey flavor and the mouthwatering smell of the smoked pork proceeding it was worth the wait (wasn't very long).< /text>

A one of a kind little place that has a cool, funky atmosphere, great coffee and very good food with some unusual flavor combinations. Best of all it's not pretentious. If I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular. I look forward to visiting again on my next trip to the area.</text>

<Review>Great little niche spot in a cool area. You can get some good healthy food, and have a couple of drinks while in the same day, enjoy a great cup of coffee. People that come seem to be pretty laid-back and carefree. Highly recommended!</Review>< Pictures>

Great experience at Te Mana Cafe! I've visited four times now and enjoyed each trip! For a chill, relaxing vibe, tasty food (the mehalini bagel is absolutely delicious!) and the best matcha latte I've ever had, I happily suggest checking them out!< /Text>

Owner lady is so chill and truly gives a damn about your relaxed memorable experience.

I spent days hanging out here with my traveling buddy chick friend.
Breakfast, lunch and the yummiest coffee concoctions.
Live music by ppl who were encouraged to just walk in and play.

Good ambiance with their patio and lots of plants. Food was overly priced however, and not very good. They were really small portions, poorly flavored and not much work put into it.< /text>

Nice little cafe that is dog friendly (even saw dogs inside hanging out on couches). Food was ok and took a long time for it to come out. Felt like we went at a time that wasn't too busy and tables were not cleaned up right away which might be why there were a lot of flies around the area.</Review>

Owners and staff are so friendly and laid back.  We were a large order of 5 and food came out quick and was delicious.  We had the Hawaiian plate (pulled pork and chicken) and the morning mana which you can add Spam (trip down memory lane).  The food is delicious and the outdoor cafe area is great!< /Review>

<Text>Dogs are allowed but this place isn't dog friendly.  One bowl of water in the place for all dogs to share you have pretty much wait on yourself (staff isn't very friendly either). So not worth $50 for breakfast for 2 people and 2 dogs.  First time I've ever left a review this low for any establishment.< /Text>< date>

Can't adequately put into words how special this place is. We lived in OB for 2 years and Te Mana became part of our routine. Top notch coffee and eats, gorgeous surroundings they've created from the house they lived in before converting into the cafe. Jason and Marguerite, we miss you! We'll have to visit soon and introduce our little guy to the magic that is Te Mana.</text>

Smaller menu, creative though. Wasn't a fan of the acai bowl (wish it was made with acai roots). Coffee was average. Very cool ambiance. 4/5 Stars. Pricey for a quick bite.</Review>

Cosy little house, lots of nooks where you can drink your coffee. Real fire was burning in the fireplace on this cold February day. Hardwood floors, plenty of outdoor seating in the enclosed yard, dog friendly, lots of plants. Perfect ambiance. Service was good, casual, friendly. Coffee and pastries were tasty. Great place to hang out, study, or take a date.< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Everything is great here, including the owners and employees. Great breakfast dishes as well as traditional Hawaiin plates. Only reason it doesn't get 5 Stars is because it's about 20% more expensive than everywhere else, i.e. a breakfast sandwich on a bagel will run you $10. You can go literally anywhere else and get something similar for $6-$8.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I love this hometown, cozy restaurant cafe. The style here is an organically-grown, family-owned and operated LOCALS joint with the flair of a staycation. While your butt is cradled in the comfy chairs one can enjoy any number of delicious drinks. Lime in the Coconut is hands down my favorite drink right now. It has the right amount of sweetness accompanying the tart and creamy flavor of the fruity components.

Food wise, this place has you covered! Hawaiian plates and salads are always fresh and crafted with love. I never feel rushed or get the sense that the people working here consider this a "job".. maybe its the reggae! I definitely feel a sense of community and leisure when I lounge here sipping a tea or dirty chai.< /review>

I was a guest visitor to the Ocean Beach professional networking luncheon which is held at this Ta mana Cafe, out on the back porch under the shade.  For lunch, I ordered and ate their 2-kinds of Hawaiian meet served with macaroni salad. Mmmm.. the taste of the food was outstanding.<//text>

Nice people but way too noisy to work with the incredibly loud blenders going on all day long making smoothies. They really oughta invest in quieter models and some kind of enclosure. Impossible to have a phone call there because to the person on other end of the line it's like hearing a chainsaw going off<//Text>

<Time>1470457679529< /Time><rating>1<//rating><Text>Very pleasant place, BUT TOOOOOO EXPENSIVE. And the service was so diapointing. The gal at the counter was so impersonal. $9.95 for a couple of eggs with a little basil and cheese and small bowl of fruit. No toast, no potatoes. And the $4 cup of very ordinary coffee. People, this is Ocean Beach for God sake, it should not cost $14 for a light breakfast. Such great possibilities but such a miss.  Won't be going back. Too bad, would have loved to have a nice local go-to place.</Text>< pics>

<review>By far my favorite hidden spot in Ocean Beach.  Hawaiian inspired dishes that don't disappoint.  Smoothies that don't make me feel like I've just drank enough sugar to last me a lifetime.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast.  I love that the cafe is an old house.  You can sit inside or on the wonderful patio and enjoy the sunshine.  I suggest ordering the morning mana and Maui wowwy for a perfect breakfast<//review>< Pictures>

WIC is a  great place for women with low income. They have educational info for moms and help with important things like formula, milk, bread, eggs, peanutbutter. Not sure why they give out juice for babies though. Overall helpful and nice staff. Also, 2x a year they offer a free dental check for the babies receiving benefits. You can even opt into a flouride treatment if you feel it's appropriate.< /Review>

My son's dad came in to sign up and they wouldn't help him. They made me come in and confirm he's the dad (tho he had babies birth certificate ) and that baby lives with him and told him that mothers don't just give dad's babies! ! Guess men can't get wic for their children when it's needed because it's a women's program.  All I know is that my son needed milk and I don't like that they turned him away for being a man.<//Text>

I really like this office and the staff and have only had positive experiences here but I dread having to bring my children because the in office toys are always so gross and of course they want to play with them. I understand wear and tear but when the dirty buildup can be seen then it's really time to sanitize the toys.</review>

<Response>{'time': 1490806592757, 'text': 'Hi Michelle! It sounds like you had a negative experience at our office, and for that, we sincerely apologize. Because of your feedback, we took the opportunity to reiterate our breastfeeding recommendations at a staff in-service yesterday. We follow the American Academy of Pediatrics Association recommendations on breastfeeding. They recommend that babies be exclusively breastfed for about the first 6 months of life and that babies continue to breastfeed as long as is mutually desired by the mother and baby. Many members of our staff are trained certified lactation counselors and we strive to counsel and educate our community about the benefits of breastfeeding. We love it when moms and babies breastfeed! If you want to discuss your experience further, please contact Julie Casillas, RD, IBCLC at (559) 263-1380.'}</Response><gmap_id>0x8094609f0745960b:0x3bffb8da2c363da6</gmap_id>< Pictures>

I went in for a smog told the guy I had $60 and he said, that he had a coupon for me and that it would be $50 . My car wasn’t passing the emissions test and he asked me if I wanted him to run the entire test . I said yes. After the test was finished I was happy to hear it wasn’t a Cadillac Converter I needed but, a miner problem. He didn’t charge me one penny! I was grateful and I will be a returning customer. The place was clean the guys wore masks and it was quick.<//review>

Best experience I have had a smog center anytime. Ace is a great guy with a sweet and warm. personality.He had me in and out in no time. The shop is clean and. professional. Best of all it is family owned by Ace. If you need a smog you can't beat the service and vibe. Excellent.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Excellent place to get a smog check. Friendly, quick, and convenient service - you can stay in your car. There were 4 cars in front of me and each took less than 10 minutes, so the wait was not long. My sedan cost $65 (prices vary by car types) and there's a $15 coupon on the website. Cash recommended - there's a 1.5% charge for credit and debit cards.</review>< Pictures>

Never too busy. Lube station is fast. Thier smog station can not accomadate lower type cars (sports cars etc.).I took my Corvette to smog there and they they could not smog it because it was to low and would not work in their smog platform.< /Review>

The guy running the smog portion of the business is incredibly fast and polite.  Although he can be difficult to understand at times, he is good at what he does and will have you in and out in under ten minutes.   $45, and its across from the Dmv.  Renewing registration tags was a breeze thanks to this gentleman and his quick, enthusiastic and efficient work.  Not to mention you just drive through.   I didn't have to drag my exhausted 3 year old out of the car.   Saved the day!<//Text>

Great smog shop!

I work in the auto industry and can tell you these guys are very professional and
trustworthy.

They had me in and out in less than 10 minutes.

I shopped around today before taking my car in and this place had the lowest price I could find in Ventura (when using the coupon from their website)

Thank you guys, ill be back<//review>

I've had no issues here and have used them twice. PLEASE BE ADVISED that the smog station leases the space from the Lube and Tune business, so it does not have the same hours as advertised. The smog station starts at 9 am. I don't have a google account, so I'm posting with my wife's, but I have taken my RV and my truck here and the guy is quick, efficient, and professional. I gave four stars as I've paid less for smogs in the past, but not knowing what the going rate is, perhaps that's unfair.<//text>

I went there to get a smog test and the guy had no idea what he was doing. He couldn't even start my car! He called me over and asked if I was having battery problems then asked me to try and start it. I started it just fine. Then it took him a while just to get his equipment to start working. I should have just stopped him there and left but I didn't and my car failed. Thing is I took it to the dealership and they couldn't find anything wrong with my car that it would have failed. I am NEVER going back to this place. The dealership even told me not to go back there. I don't recommend this place at all!< /Text>

Hey everybody, if your car needs a smog check, I strongly encourage you NOT to go to Xpress Smog and Test (Connected to Xpress Lube, right next to Subway and America's Tire)

My car has NEVER failed a test, and this place failed me TWICE! After the second fail I told him I that wasn't going to pay, but instead take my car directly to Auto Masters to pass my smog and show him... and guess what? It passed :) Thanks for nothing, Xpress Smog and Test</Review>

Armando was amazing. The quality of the food, customer service and organization was beyond any taco catering I've come across. I will be booking future parties with The Stand "American Classics Redefined".< /Text>

<text>Very good comfort food! Their regular fries are the best I've had. Very crispy and tasty! The fries were served with mayo-curry, which tasted weird because it's an unusual combo for me. My friend tried their blueberry bacon pizza, I didn't try it but few other customers ordered it as we were eating there.

Menu can look a little overwhelming at first but plenty of yummy options. There is a vegetarian burger called the west side veggie $9.10. The hamburger was good and I could see the veggies in the patty.
Wasn't impressed by the fire fries. Was expecting some type of powder on them but they had a sauce on them that I didn't like.
Unique spot definitely worth checking out.<//text>

The Blueberry Bacon Blue Cheese Burger cannot be missed if you happen to be in the Bay Area. I was skeptical as I worry the the sweet and savory mixture would be too much but it was mostly savory with just enough sweet and that's the way to go. The Stand "American Classics Redefined"< /text>

<Review>I love that you can get the burger in a lettuce wrap. Burger flavors are interesting and meat is of high quality. A little overpriced once you add a side salad but I think it's the best option in the little strip of restaurants there on Century Park east.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bbf2ddf7df53:0x98b6426452f76d5c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good prices and we'll maintained. Only drawback is no credit card readers. Probably helps keep the price low though so not a big issue!</Text>

Ca$h only - Starting at $2 you can rinse your car with their brush, pressure hose, vacuum and your labor. The layout means that the stalls are open and not protected from each other and on most days the vacuum/drying station is down wind from the washing station so be prepared to get overspray.</review>

<username>Nicholle Pierro (NichyD)</username><date>1604115865312< /date><Rate>4< /Rate><review>Decent car wash place. Their foam brushes are too soft to get a really deep scrub for tough dried-on spots. Also, the suction of their vacuums could be better. I couldn't fit the vacuum head in the space between my seat and the door so that is still dirty. Unless you are a perfectionist, this is overall, a good spot though! 👍🏾<//review>< pics>

<review>It is average that could slide into below average. Soap is watered down. Small area for a big truck but truck will fit. Timers seem a little quicker than should be.

For the most part it is like any old car wash, but for some reason the people that bring their cars here spend a lot of time cleaning them, which en encourages me to do the same.

Decent coin operated car wash. Usually a line here, as there are only four bays and a lot of people take their time. Since I'm only ever rinsing off my bike I'm usually in and out pretty quickly.<//Text>

And if you don't want anything that you just got, then you can't get your coin back. This place only takes cash no coins so I guess stop at a store or a bank before you get here.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I entered the store and had plans to cook dinner, to my surprise the deli had a variety of dishes prepared so Chicken wings (BBQ AND HOT WINGS) CESAR SALAD AND FOR DESSERT AMBROSIA. NOT TO BAD. Didn't have to cook and it didn't break the bank. All in all 2 thumb up.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I really like this Lucky's. It is smaller but tends to have everything I usually get and lots of options. Great produce section and I love the deli! The deli tends to get really raided before dinner time so if you have a fav, pick it up earlier than the 5:30 rush hour or chances are it will be gone.
I love that they have baggers still! Be patient, many of them are high school or college age and might not bag exactly how you would want. I always support working students & training ppl so I have never had a problem past making my bags a little heavy.<//Review>< Pictures>

I like this store. Great beer section. Ice cold.
The lines are short. The selection and pricing are very good. Quality and cleanliness are excellent. This is my preferred store and I live in Napa.</Text>

I despise going to Lucky’s. One of the worst experiences I’ve encountered by far is the black female cashier with short hair. On numerous occasions she is enraged when customers don’t bag their groceries the way she wants them bagged.

I attempt to go on days she is isn’t working as I dread going to Lucky’s. The only benefit is that it’s the closest grocery store.

I pay for the product, I pay for the bag, I bag them how I want them to be bagged.</review>

Be careful
With the orange machine
I just witnessed how they don’t wash the oranges before the go in to the machine also I noticed how the employee that was adding the oranges put a bad orange that had moldy green staff in it
They don’t check the oranges before the dump the box

Can you imagine how many hands touch the oranges from point A to point B
That’s disgusting

Hopefully management do something or the city</review>

It's always clean, easy parking, the atmosphere is always upbeat, with someone available to help if needed, with anything from finding a product, to assisting you all the way to the car, especially with heavy items for those of us that just can't do things like we used to.</Text>

It's a super market. Clean and bright, has everything. Produce is good, but could be better. Meat department the same. Staff is friendly and helpful. Prices ok. It works.< /text>

It was extremely rude not to mention wrong, when we were younger we used to work at a luckys and this is bad quality service.

I really like this market on California Blvd, or st. I don't know which one, anyway a lot of variety. Great meat sections. Downside is it's very hard to find products.</text>

Very rude employees... When it comes to customer service they definitely need to remember they are out of grade school and are working for a public establishment and need to act accordingly. Nobody has the right to assume or judge a person's character based on an appearance. Not everyone goes to the store dressed to impress. We all have our bad days and shouldnt have to worry about being accused of doing things because of the way they look especially when all they want to do is get breakfast for an elderly woman they take care of. So basically this store isn't my first or even last choice to shop at... It falls way behind in the list of preferred stores to go to. I suggest shopping online and having it delivered. At least then you won't be subjected to criticism by people with absolutely no class whatsoever.<//text>

A supermarket can be judged only by the quality of the produce and meat and the employees. The canned, frozen, and dried stuff isn't anything they can take credit or blame for. I can't say I've never been disappointed in the produce, but almost never, and the employees are always great.< /text>

The staff at the Lucky's on California boulevard and Lincoln are wonderful! They are always helpful and kind. The store itself is always clean and typically check out time are minimal. It's nice that they are in the neighborhood.<//review>

Anytime we are in there, they are understaffed or not very helpful. The quality of the products is low and quite often, they just don't have items. They pretty much have a non-existent meat department and really cater to the pure basics and nothing more. We liken them to a generic Safeway.  An area known for its food and fresh items, Lucky really does not even try. I'd rather go to the discount Mexican marts as they are better stocked.<//Review>

****edited post renovation****
The new renovations completed beginning of 2020 are great. This Lucky now has a self serve salad and hot bar with many options for a quick lunch or dinner. There is seating at the front of the store if you want to eat your food before you leave.Their new frozen entre self serve option seems quite interesting although I have not tried it yet. As always the shelves are neat and faced and full of stock. Lucky prices are higher than other groceries but the shopping experience is above and beyond its competition and, I believe, worth paying a few extra pennies for!<//Text><gmapID>0x808506f96fef96dd:0xc87854a3a4988ff9<//gmapID>< user_name>

This grocery store is conveniently located off of the freeway. Some things are easy to find but some things are so I difficult to find, I've given up and gone elsewhere. I seldomly shop here but I stop in sometimes since it's close to where I work. During each of my visits the store seems to be the same, not very crowded. Finding someone to help is can be hit or miss. The decor is reminiscent of the early 90s.</Text>

I am writing this to let you know what a wonderful staff you have at this store. While looking for a package of chicken thighs in the meat department  I lost a diamond stud earring. It fell in the grate on the edge of the case. I asked Rocky working at the counter for help and he went above and beyond to look for it. It wasn’t found but I left with a very grateful feeling that they cared so much to help me to the extent that they did. I know there are stores that would not have put that much effort in helping someone. I would like to give you10 stars if I could!! Thank you< /Review>

The new cases are noted.  Already people come in and look at them drawn to the cases in the front.  It’s looking better.</text>

This is my neighborhood market, less than .5 miles from home. This could potentially be the only store I shop at, convenient and the service is always helpful and friendly. They have been improving the selection of organic and natural foods. The organic produce selection is still VERY limited.

I can't connect to a cell network inside the store to access online shopping lists or recipes. Lack of Wi-Fi makes shopping here inconvenient and frustrating.< /Review>

My LAST trip was no different. I had to ask three times(for three  separate problems) for assistance while the person stood there watching the problem occur, when they finally corrected the problems with the scanner,  it seemed as though I had asked them to give up their firstborn child. So, what ever happened to courtesy and customer service. ??

Love this store. To the woman below, seriously get a life. Why would a grocery store have wifi? Don't be cheap and use you're network! Seriously... what's wrong with people!</Review>

Much cleaner and safer now that they have cut back the trees and bushes and mulched so the bums that proliferate in Napa can't hang out anymore and leave their trash around.</Text>

It had a lot choices.  A very large location. Had difficulty at checkout and they were not helpful (Had to do with signing up for escip) would've appreciated better service. Besides that, found everything I was looking for</review>

This grocery store has no wifi. Forget about texting or talking to anyone on the phone while your in there. Other than that it has everything you might need as far as essentials go.</Review>
