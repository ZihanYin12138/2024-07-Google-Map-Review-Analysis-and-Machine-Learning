<text>The 2 stars are because the flowers delivered were satisfactory:; however, the customer service was horrific. We placed an order online and prepaid, but our flowers did not arrive as scheduled. We called to ascertain their status, but no one answered the phone so we drove to the shop to inquire and folliw up. We were treated rudely by the staff who refused to provide us with any infirmation other than to state they could not locate our order. When we raised the issue of online fraud and a refund, our order magically appeared and the flowers were eventually delivered albeit very late. There are many competent florists in MB. Growing Wild is not amongst them.< /text>< Pics>

The orchid arrangement was more gorgeous than in the website photo! It was for my colleague's 10yr work anniversary and she said they were perfect; exactly the kind of arrangement she wanted to place in her redesigned kitchen which has a high ceiling and a large island table.</text>

Flower for our Anniversary.  My wife says this is the best bouquet of flowers she has received since the first dozen roses I sent her 30 years ago.

The bouquet that was sent to our daughter for her 30th birthday was fresh, beautiful and the colors so vivid.   This little shop is a real find when you are in town.  Absolutely so gorgeous You want to buy everything they have.  The delivery was on time and the delivery person very kind and friendly.  We are so pleased with their customer service also.   The shop called me to confirm the order and let me know that it would go out on time.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.</review>

My order was delivered at 10:30am and left outside of the recipients house. I was not called until 4:30pm and told this information. When I asked the delivery person why he didn’t call me sooner so that I could call the person I sent the bouquet to and let them know their flowers were just left sitting in the HOT sun all day..his response..”I don’t know.”
I then called the store and received a call back two days later with an apology.
I’ve used this store for years. This is  unacceptable.  At a minimum they should have re-sent the delivery or refunded me the order. Clearly the flowers were ruined sitting outside all day.
Very disappointing< /review>

I ordered from Growing Wild and the flowers were delivered quickly and were even prettier than the image online. Thank you so much. You never know what will be delivered when ordering flowers that you will never see, so I was happy that these were what was depicted on the website. I'll order from Growing Wild again.< /Text>

Because the arrangements look so beautiful and unique online and they receive so many glowing reviews, I was excited to order from Growing Wild. However, I was very disappointed with my experience as the item delivered was not up to par with the quality I expected from the price I paid and images shown online. I tried to contact GW many times by email to discuss the difference between the expected arrangement (I had even ordered a premium upgrade) and what was delivered, but I still haven't received a reply.<//text>

<Text>Growing Wild is a fantastic florist shop.  You will not be disappointed.  They make beautiful arrangements and are always on the cutting edge of design.  Whether you are looking for a gift, a centerpiece for a party, or a beautiful piece for your home, you will be able to find it here.  My personal favorites are their door wreaths and their succulents.  I also like to purchase hostess gifts here during the holidays because they always have great ornaments and unique things in all price ranges.</Text>< UserId.>

I highly recommend  Growing Wild!<//review>

Growing Wild takes flowers and home decorating to another level - they are true artists. Their arrangements are unique, thoughtful and breathtaking. I am always amazed at what they come up with and receive lots of compliments.  I haven't used their home decorating service yet, but after seeing the work they did at a friend's house for the holidays, I was blown away and will definitely take advantage of this service in the future!<//Review>

Growing Wild has amazing items:  Fun floral arrangements with candles and succulents included, artwork, and holiday gifts.  I have two floral arrangements in my home and 2 pieces of art that are in my entry way from Growing Wild.  I recommend this shop if you are looking for original, creative, "hip", and gorgeous arrangements.  They have the latest and newest trends of art and flowers so stop by if you are in the area!<//review>

Growing Wild is the best little neighborhood florist around. Been going for so many years for gifts, corsages and great arrangements for the home. They will even come and deck your house out for the holidays!!  Growing Wild is also so generous to the community as they donate to everyone!

Growing Wild is hands-down the best quality florist I have ever come across - a total class act.  Their arrangements and wreaths are the most original and beautiful. And they have gorgeous and creative home decor for the holidays and throughout the year - indeed, I just received some of their Thanksgiving decor that promptly went on my mantle. I have other pieces from Growing Wild that I bring out for Easter and Christmas that I love - they are elegant pieces that stand the test of time (their ornaments are like no others!).  Still hanging is a shell wreath I was given as a house warming present 13 years ago that makes the room.  The owners are incredibly generous to the community as well.  I co-founded a nonprofit and Growing Wild has, without exception, answered the call for every single event we have ever thrown.  They are true community partners, and for that we in this tiny beach town are grateful.</review>

We’re always taken away with Growing Wild’s arrangements and customer service. We ordered my Aunt this beautiful orchid/succulent combo for her birthday. While I was traveling in New York, Growing Wild dropped her arrangement off on her front porch and someone sadly stole it. I emailed GW immediately That night after realizing she hadn’t received the arrangement. They called me at 8am the next morning and put together a new one for her. So sad that someone would do this, but Growing Wild’s service was heart warming and unbelievable. We will absolutely continue to be customers of Growing Wild. My family and I highly recommend all of their arrangements. We love this locally owned business!< /review>

Extraordinary flowers, service, and attention to detail.  I've ordered from Growing Wild on several occasions and every time, the recipient was extremely happy and satisfied and commented on the incredible arrangements.  Most have also sent pictures of the arrangements I'd sent and I've always had my expectations surpassed with the arrangement that was sent.  THANK YOU!< /Text>

From the very start I should have been wary, called approximately 10 times before I was able to reach anyone at the store. The staff who answered the phone was apologetic and took my order for an orchid to be delivered the following day for a birthday. The flowers were never delivered.

For flower store who advertises as a Bloomnation partner, this is pretty disappointing although not as disappointed as my girlfriend who did not receive flowers on her birthday. I will look elsewhere for flowers next time.<//Review>

<review>Fantastic service. The owner gave us a free estimate, and when he was done, they dropped off our car looking like new. Very professional and matched the paint perfectly. He also had his staff detail the car inside and out at no extra charge. Highly recommended!</review>< pictures>

I went to give away my car and it was a good experience.  the workers are good people the prices are cheap depending on what your car has.  A unique service really surprised me.  If you want to come, come without fear of recommending it to everyone.  100% worth of services.  don't wait for me and come<//text>

<Review>Sacramento Collision Center is hands down the best place if you’re trying to go fix your car, see what’s wrong with it and to see what’s something it might need, this is at the city of Sacramento!

I’ve gotten my car fixed up by different people and places but something always happens so I have to go but I got tired of that so I decided to give this this place a try and man! This place is just fantastic! I got my car fixed here car like 3 months ago and waited to do this review so I could also review the car and oh my god! First of all, the car has been absolutely amazing! They gave me a very good deal and the car itself feels nicer, it evens feels like it drives different by how good fixed it!

Going inside, this gentleman approached me in a very nice way and seemed very happy to help me out and to show me my cars details and what was wrong with it and what he was going to fix and how he was going to do that! Very good at explaining, Thank you!

I absolutely loved the way he expressed himself and I could tell right away he loved what he does and was trying to get the best deal for me and to get my car fixed and back to me as soon as possible !!

I just wanted to say that if you’re looking to fix your car in the city of Sacramento and you’re not thinking of going to Sacramento Collision Center, then you’re just truly not getting your car fixed the right way!

There’s no better place to get your car fixed than Sacramento Collision Center for all you people in the City of Sacramento!

Nothing bad I can say about this place!

Great Service!
Awesome People!
Amazing and Spectacular Way they do their work!

Shout out to the worker there I’m sorry I can’t remember his name but thanks for the great service, he seemed very passionate and you could just tell by the way he expreses himself that he loves his job and what he does on a daily basis!

Loved this place!< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The best collision center I’ve been to.
I’ve had really bad experiences in the past with other collision centers where they have kept my car for almost 2 months. At Sacramento Collision Center you will be treated with respect, with amazing, quality work/service  that you’ll feel like you’re getting back a brand new car!!
Please feel free to stop by if you ever need their service, you won’t be disappointed! That’s why I give them a 5 star review.</Review>

I took my car to Collision Center a couple days ago and I picked up today. They guys were very professional, on time and with the best quality work.
They also helped me with the deductible.
I do recommend Sacramento Collision Center.< /Review>

A week ago I took my vehicle, that they painted it, because I had color faults and that they fixed some adjustments inside the vehicle, when they called me to go to remove the vehicle it was like new, I did not notice the faults that existed before. In addition the local workers kindly behaved that they deserve their recognition in this comment.
Finally friends I recommend this place has an excellent service 100% reliable if you want to fix your vehicle.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Excellent service!!🥳 a quality of attention, behavior and especially 5-star presence, they do not need anything, the employees even advise you and recommend some improvements that you can make to your car according to your tastes so that you can improve it and  you like it even more like it happened with me.  The prices are excellent, they leave your car like new, in general everything is very good.  I went to fix my car which is a Mustang 5.0 2017 because it brought strange noises in the engine and when I picked it up it was like new, as if I had just bought it even until modifications I got to do it since they have all the requirements  necessary to provide you with the best service and that suits your needs.  I am from Arizona and I would love for a company like this to be there, they make you treat with confidence and respect by providing you with a great service.  It is an experience of fixing your car very easy, simple and at a very good price, in addition to giving you the confidence you need, I would certainly do it many more times without hesitation!!😁😁</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809acfd95f925ea1:0xafbc138beff18445</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Excellent service, I wasn't sure which body shop should I go to fix my crashed truck, I heard very good comments about this place and decided to try fixing my truck here.  I could not be more grateful to the personal treatment of all employees, each one made me feel safe that I was in the right place and that I had my truck in good hands.  My truck had two shocks, one in front and one in the back, in the two shocks the truck dropped the paint, so it looked so bad. At the moment they talked to me to tell me that it was all fixed I could not believe it was truck, they left my F150 as new, I will always recommend this place, they provide quality service and great prices.<//review>< date>

I was delighted with the repair and painting work they did on my car.
Without a doubt Sacramento Collision Center is the only company in the area that has the ability to leave the vehicles as new.

Think no more!
Sacramento Collision Center is the best option to pamper your car.< /text>

<Review>Outstanding customer service! I've used the repair shop twice now and I couldn't be happier. They went out of their way to work with my schedule and repaired a part that was outside of the scope of the bodywork repair. Even did the repair faster so I could get my CAR back sooner as I had an upcoming out-of-town trip. Highly recommend!!!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

They are the best in the market, I took a car to repair and they left it perfect, quality parts until now I have not failed again.  What impressed me most was the treatment I received and how I received the super detailed car, washed and vacuumed, highly recommended if your car failed and you have little money to repair it they are your best option, they fit your budget.  super recommended very punctual and responsible give you the car the day the deal was agreed< /Text>

A few weeks ago, while in Las Vegas for a business trip, I was involved in a car accident and was referred to Sacramento Collision Center by a friend of mine. Since I am not from the area, I needed to find a shop that was reputable but also one that could accommodate my time restraint. So, I called Sacramento Collision Center  and they agreed to see my car immediately for an estimate. The owner of the shop, personally inspected my car and wrote up a detailed quote. He informed me of the extent of my damages and also walked me through the process of getting my car fixed. I was extremely impressed by his willingness to explain what needed to be done, as I was NOT expecting such a thorough breakdown. So, I obviously decided to hire the shop to conduct my repairs. BEST DECISION EVER. In as little as 5 days, the repairs were completed and my car was ready to be picked up. Take note that throughout those few days, I would receive daily updates regarding the repair status. This type of service is unheard of. To be honest, I was speechless when I showed up to pick up my car. It looked better after the repairs were done than prior to my accident. The shop had even washed my car and left it spotless  100% I am beyond satisfied with the OVERALL service of Sacramento Collision Center . The cleanliness and respect of the staff was a huge bonus. I am so lucky that I was referred to this place. I don't know what I would have done if it weren't for these guys! Literally, TWO THUMBS UP!!!<//Review>

<Review>There really are no words to describe the attention, my car sincerely I thought it would be junk but they did a spectacular job there is no doubt, I can even dare to say that the painting was much better than agency, and the time in which  they had it ready, it has no comparison. I think they are the fastest in the city and every time I asked to see progress there were them, it was amazing, really if they have an accident do not hesitate to take it, you will love the work!< /Review>< pics>

Excellent bodyshop to take your vehicle, I took my BMW 5 Series to this place after an accident, it was a totally different experience that I imagined, this for several reasons:

1.- Repair: I have had the experience that being a BMW always raise the prices and with them were always very transparent at all times and they always showed me the spare parts and their authenticity, I noticed that they use the right tools for the repair and with higher quality (in my view) than in the cart agency itself.

2.- Detailed: It took me a big surprise to receive my car since the quality of the finish was impressive and the cart looked like I had bought it again, the tones of the colors did not contrast at any time and the paint had exactly the same tone as that of the car (even though my car is 2014).

3.- Customer service: They were always giving me the necessary follow-up and resolved my , they really understood the client about the topic of the $ and answer all my concerns that I had regarding the details.

In conclusion i really recommend Sacramento Collision Center, they have an amazing service, time of delivery, quality and work in each of their jobs.</Text>

The service at Sacramento Collision Center is extremely good, they give you the necessary attention with what you need, their workers do the best job with your car, two weeks ago I took my Toyota Corolla because I had some problems in the suspension and strange sounds, trust  and after a few days I went to see how it had been, and without any reason they did an excellent job with a lot of quality, my car was completely repaired and ready to use, sincerely I am very grateful for the great work they did, I recommend them, without the  top  5 stars .<//Review>

What a good customer service has the super recommended workshop for family and friends and also for the paint that colored my car was super beautiful that left me speechless, when I saw my vehicle I said WOOOW, and soon we will meet again to make others arrangements,and that the impeccable punctuality, the very good quality, and also the prices are very accessible to an average person, the work of the unique and original mechanics.And another thing that I liked a lot about the mechanics is that they tell you that your vehicle is in good hands and that the vehicle is also 100% safe in the workshop free of thefts etc.
And the workshop is located in a very good area, my respect for the mechanics excellent service.<//Text>

Recently I went and visited Sacramento Collision Center Because the painting of my car was very worn a friend recommended this place and I went to visit it the truth is that the work was impeccable besides the attention they gave me was very wonderful and the Price seemed very appropriate
I am happy with the work that these boys did and I want to highly recommend this place because as I said they do a very good job at a very good price and others are located in a very central place for all the public and the facilities are very nice and  Modern
There are several sections to fix several cars at the same time which makes your car not take long to be ready and I liked that a lot
Thank you very much Sacramento Collision Center for everything<//Review>

I had a slight accident with my car and I hit the rear fender which had a bit of paint coming off, I was worried that the paint could not be recovered and that I had to pay too much but since I arrived in the workshop, the people was very kind to me, they gave me a very affordable budget than in other places and I could have my car as a new, I took the opportunity to fix other small details, an incredible place with a high quality service 10 of 5 stars!!!</text>

Although my car was total loss, a guy crashed into the back and I was pressed into a wall, they work wonders left the car better than new and shines more than ever, I reflect on it, I was honestly angry because I thought that  It would not be the same, but being honest, I recommend them, the guy who is attending the entrance is very friendly, from when you arrive until you leave, they offered me service to take me and bring me home, greetings guys keep it up.< /review>

Great service, I liked how they treated me and they are also accurate in giving time and form your vehicle does not have any tricks they leave your car at 100 and the price is flexible, they have good quality, Ami recently I was getting my car fixed  The back face why I recently suffered a small accident and create the good quality that they manufacture all their work environment is very clean and tidy and they always treat you in a good way, I highly recommend it.<//text>

What a amazing  place, i was sad because i think my car doesnt get repair, fortunately i found sacramento collision center and i can smile again, i met excellent people who help me with mi car problem and the best thing is what they give me excellent prices and they give me my car in short time, thank you all guys for all your support you are incredible.
The best option in sacramento to repair cars.< /Review>

<review>I was in a small accident where a woman hit the front right side of my new 2 week old Camaro! Ugh!  I am extremely impressed with the quality of work they did. My car is back to the way it was, as if nothing ever happen! I will not be taking my Maro anywhere else. I totally recommend Sacramento Collision Center to anyone.<//review>< Pictures>

Excellent service so I recommend it since they have a lot of responsibility at work and take care of the car as if it were theirs. So do not hesitate to visit them.

<Review>An okay haircut for $20. They had a lot of customers today and seemed like they were rushing the haircuts to get the next customer in the chair. They do not take credit cards either. CASH ONLY. They asked me to take off my mask when I sat down. They do not take temperature of incoming customers either.

As for the actual cut, it wasn't the best haircut, but it will do.

This was my first time here so I decided to go give it a try. I probably won't be coming back as I don't like it when they rush and dont take their time.

It's convenient though.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Ron is a true master of his craft. My haircut is perfect every time. In addition, the shop is always clean and all the barbers are true professionals. It is the only place I will go for a haircut.</Text>

Never coming back here again the guy cutting my hair was nice but not very good.he took about 10 minutes to cut my hair and seems like he was trying to trying to get me out as fast as possible and his co worker was rushing him to cut another customers hair.my hair was uneven I had to find another shop to fix his mistake.my barber is closed due to COVID or I wouldn’t have came here.there are better options in El Cajon that are a lot more professional I’m surprised this place has been open as long as it has been.the haircut was $35 but I gave him $60 because of how nice the guy was and I’m not the type to not pay because I wasn’t happy I just won’t be coming back and won’t recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

So I am new to the area just  figured what out a barbershop right across the street how convenient  And when I looked up the reviews I was kind of impressed only to come to find out what a nightmare this place is been here about five or six times  I always get sent to the two new barbers would look like they’re practicing on my hair  I have requested to make appointments with other barbers but they all swear like they’re too busy to take on new client If you are too busy making money that’s perfectly fine I will take my business somewhere else where it is appreciated and by the way they’re always speaking another language And on the phone most of the time they are cutting your hair worst experience ever</text>

First time customer. While it cost more then I like to pay, the service was outstanding. I didn't have to wait at all. As soon as I walked in George greeted me and started cutting. First time for straight edge shave for me. I will go back definitely.</text>

Excellent shop, I highly recommend it. Great atmosphere and prices. Barbers are first class. Received a fantastic cut, finished with a wet razor around the edges. Walk ins receive fast service. I'll be a regular customer now.< /text>

<Review>Edward and Sam have owned and operated this salon for 20 plus years they are very professional and their cuts are awesome. You get full service, cut and shave for a reasonable price, lowest in East county for the end result, other places are cheaper but they dont know how to cut hair<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Be careful which barber you choose... I got a haircut from here one day by someone who wasn't my usual and I swear the kid probably didnt even have a barber license! It was HORRIBLE! When I went back to get it fixed (by Jack my regular) he even commented about the cut and showed me one portion where it was uneven by a few inches at least. Literally the last time I wen't in there. Jack and Mark and the Owner are the only ones I'd trust..<//review>

First time customer at this location and so very satisfied.  I called at 8:30am for all new tires and complete inspection. They had me done by 1pm. The experience from start to finish was excellent.<//Review>

They were awesome. I had low tire alert in my car. I can't get down to check or fill tires easily. Asked them to check and fill them for me and they did. Quickly and easily. Great service. Outstanding!! Thank you to them.</Review>

<review>The work performed by Les Schwab Elk Grove is always impressive.  Years ago I took my Chevrolet to this facility as a last resort to correct a suspension issue the dealer could not correct yet the dealer charged over $450 for their attempts.  Les Schwab Elk Grove corrected the issue for only $78.  Today Rex, service technician, provided the same level of expert work on my Jeep Wrangler.  Thank you Les Schwab for hiring only the best mechanics.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1600370554182, 'text': "Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to earn your business, Jim!

This Les Schwab in Elk Grove is a really nice one and the people are very helpful they really pay attention to their jobs. The Les Schwab from Florin Road set us to the one in Elk Grove for a battery because they didn't have one and they made sure of it before we went so we didn't waste our time or gas and I thought that was awesome I highly recommend them.</Text>

<review>I went to get a puncture fixed. I wasn't sure what to expect given that the car has run flat tires. It took them over an hour. I was preparing myself for anything between 40-50 to 300-400 for a new tire. I was pleasantly surprised when the front desk person told me that it was free if charge. They took their time to fix knowing that it will be free. I am sold as customer for life 🙂.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I would like to give a special thank you to REX. I had been looking for Air Shocks for quite sometime now, after many No's, I decide to contact Les Schwab, Rex mentioned it wasn't in their catalog, but that didn't mean it wasn't a service they provided. He informed me he would do some research and get back to me. I didnt think he was going to call me back, sure enough he went the extra mile, to locate the air shocks for my car and provide the service I needed. He was able to fit me in his extremely busy schedule and finish my car sooner than  he quoted me. I am extremely happy with his work, his customer service, his willingness to go out of his way for my needs. That type of service is hard to find now a days and I am very appreciative and thankful to REX for doing so. Thank you REX, your amazing.<//text>

Update: Never got a call back on tires that were supposed to be ordered. Will call back after holidays.

Original Review: Went again today. I love the honesty! Did a brake check on Mom's car. Lu was honest with his assessment that brakes weren't necessary. Did not have to pay a cent and we now have piece of mind. Going back for the recommended tires later this week.< /text>

<text>So this is why I go back to Les schwab in Elk Grove, CA! I was driving on my home from San Jose completing a few jobs I had in the area. All day long the brakes on my truck felt bad, and I thought huh that's odd I just replaced the front rotors and pads a week ago with a friend's help. Yet all day there was a vibration/ lunging feeling and as I made my way home it was getting really bad like scarry Bad! So I thought I would call Les Schwab and ask for advise, I was fortunate to get a gentlemen by the name of Rex who advised me to stop by asap. He road in the truck with me so he could see and feel for problem,  and sure ad can be (and I am cutting this short in details)  but he went way out of his way to help and fixed my problem last minute.  He took or made time for my needs, even though he was trying to rush home to see he's son graduate all the way across town. What service!! Love these guys and thank you so much Rex you are an inspiration! CONGRATULATIONS to your son and all of your family!<//text>< rate>

<Text>They are good when you are paying for new tires or paying for a service that makes them a lot of money. But if you are getting free warranty service, expect to wait for 3 hours. It seemed pretty obvious that the new customers are priority over returning people. I understand why from a business standpoint, but seeing people come in after me and leave before me sucks.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Typically emergency situations are the only things that would take precedence over another job.

<text>My girlfriend's car had an issue with two tires. I get all my tires from Les Schwab but she got her tires from somewhere else. Despite that, they didn't charge me for fixing her tires. They only asked that we consider Les Schwab for her next set of tires. Definitely going to be getting tires from them when we need them.< /text>< Rate>

<name>bishal malla< /name><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>A+++++ Service.

The best service I've ever received in any of the auto servicing store in my entire life. I've had a bad experience with auto service place most of the time where either they quote and charge more, had long wait time, push me to replace one or another thing in my car. Therefore I always get hesitant to go to auto service store and be prepared to spend at least $50 or more.
However the story was different at this location. I was there at 7:50 am and was ready to wait outside so that I dont have to wait long but surprisingly the store was already open which is impressive. A gentleman named Cody welcomed me, took my information and asked me to give me 45 min. That's it!!! That's the lowest wait time ever received in any auto service store. Anyways, I was there for because  there was a nail in one of my tyre. After 15 to 20 min Cody came and told me that he removed the nail and also recommended tyre rotation since he removed all the tyres anyways. For a moment, I thought that's their way to charge for an extra service. I accepted the tyre rotation anyways. Then after another 15 min he called me and told me everything is done. He removed the nail and rotated the tyre. When I asked him for the price, he said there is no charge. I was like are you freaking serious.  You're giving me a free service after you spend like 30 min on my car!!! I was not happy because I didn't have to pay but I was impressed thinking who would offer such service early in their morning. Being from a different culture, I feel so bad to accept his offer because in my culture we don't offer or accept free service early morning to their first customer. I looked cash on my wallet and all I had was 5 bucks. So I asked him if I can give him a tip and gave that to him despite of feeling bad that it's only $5. I hope he didn't feel bad.
Long story short, I know this is long review but its important because store like this and an employee like Cody is hard to find these days in any company. Period.
I'm not a huge reviewer esp this long but I don't want to waste a single word to praise their business ethics and etiquette. You guys not only earn my business from now now but also earn my trust and respect. Please keep doing what you're doing so that  customer like me don't have be hesitant before entering the auto servicing store. Thank you.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

Absolutely EXCELLENT experience!
Late in the day, I discovered a low rear tire.  Took it to  the local Les Schwab store, 30 minutes before closing.  They removed the screw, repaired my tire and had me out of there in no time.  Great work!  My next set of tires will be purchased at Les Schwab!< /Text>

5 stars is a real exception for me. I brought the car in for diagnostic of a front end noise.  And, I was prepared to pay for struts and possible bearings.  The tech performed tests and kept me in the loop on the results of the tests.  The reason for the extra tests is that the Tech wanted to be sure that the work addressed the problem I brought the car in for. ...
In the end, the problem was a brake pad that needed to be cleaned and put back in.  The Charge? $0.00...

The tech did find another unrelated problem that was not critical and I asked that they make that repair.  And, the cost of the repair was very reasonable!!  On a side note, when I need Bearings, Struts, Tires or an Alignment, I am going to Les Schwab!

Les Schwab has added me to their list of very happy customers.<//Review>

Two sets of premium tires on my Transit Connect, a set of premium tires on my T-100 and a remove-and-replace steering rack (rebuilt). Over half a dozen years, all the kids pay careful attention to make sure their solutions work for me. Closest thing to a race team I've found, along with the mechanics at Downtown Ford and Elk Grove Toyota. I'm passing 1.1 million miles this year -- I've found maintenance works best when I communicate effectively with the wrenches and their service writers..</Review>< Pics>

<name>cristina cooks</name><Text>My husband asked several places for quotes on brakes and this was the least expensive.We asked a  different Les Schwab  to verify the quote was correct and after they confirmed we went with them. Come to find out after they took our car appart that this was the wrong quote and it would be as expensive as all the places we had got quotes from! Well okay we were there already so we said do  the job! After the 1st day there was a dragging sound and squeaking so we went back mind you all this time I have to wait for hours after working all day!! Turns out the tech. misaligned something and had to redo the work. After the 2nd time my car was still not right and squeaking so went back they said they had to replace the rotors ,pads or what not ( I am a female that knows medicine not cars!) Had to pay extra and wait hours after work again !!!
After this 3rd time the Manager told us the brakes might squeak for the first 1000 miles but its okay... the car has been squeaking everyday and getting louder to the point to where even driving it is embarrassing and cars seem to fear getting hit in case we cant brake!!! I asked my husband to take it in a 4th time as it just does not sound normal! He takes it in this past week and they are saying that they are not responsible and making accusations of someone spraying the brakes with oil so this is why they are squeaking!!
Are they really serious? Why would we do anything to the car ? This is why I’ve been paying my hard earned money so they can take care of the problem yet after 4 times they still can’t get it right!!! If I have to I will go to court over this !!!
I should have listened to my co-workers about Les  Schwab not being good!!!
They may be good for tires but not brakes thus they should not advertise per this is false advertising!!😡<//Text><UserId.>107388347041339859692</UserId.></record>

We feel like we are treated fairly and honestly by the team at this location on each of the times we have been in for service. That latest visit involved them handling a tire warranty issue and there was no fuss or issues. Problem solved. They are often busy, so consider an appointment or be prepared for a wait, depending on the service you want done.</review>

<response>None</response><text>I HAVE A COMPLAINT. FIRST OFF I DO LIKE THEIR SERVICE, AND THEIR PRICES, BUT I DO HAVE A COMPLAINT THAT THEY DON'T SEEM TO REALLY CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT.
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I TRIED TO GET TIRES THAT ARE ON SALE, GIVEN A PRICE QUOTE, AND ONCE IT'S ON THE RACK, THEY CAME IN AND TELL ME THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE TIRES AVAILABLE. SHE THEN GOES TO TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE ANOTHER TIRE THAT COULD BE USED, BUT IT WAS MUCH,
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THEN WHAT I WAS QUOTED. UNHAPPY, I LET THEM KNOW MY DISPLEASURE, I ASKED HIM WHAT THEY COULD DO FOR ME UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. SHE SAID ONE MOMENT, LEFT, AND RETURNED TELLING ME THAT THEY HAVE A TIRE BETWEEN THOSE TWO PRICES! WHY DIDN'T SHE LET ME KNOW ABOUT THAT TIRE FIRST BEFORE SHE TRIED TO UPSELL ME THE OTHER, MORE EXPENSIVE TIRES??

THIS DOES NOT SIT RIGHT WITH ME. I CALMLY AND QUIETLY LET HER KNOW THAT A CUSTOMER MUST BE GIVEN A REASON TO WANT TO RETURN, BUT OTHER THAN JUST A "SORRY", NOTHING WAS DONE THAT WOULD MAKE ME WANT TO RETURN TO THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION.

I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THIS LOCATION, BUT SINCE THIS BUSINESS PRACTICE DOES NOT SIT RIGHT WITH ME, I WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER GOING ELSEWHERE. I NEED TWO REAR TIRES, AND WE'LL HAVE TO CONSIDER MY OTHER OPTIONS. NOBODY REALLY CARED.

THE TIRES WERE EXCELLENT, AS WAS THE BALANCING AND MOUNTING.

(IT'S BEEN AWHILE NOW, AND I NOTICED THAT THE OWNER DID NOT RESPOND TO MY POST LIKE MOST EVERYBODY ELSE DID WHEN THEY COMMENTED. I WILL BE GOING TO A DIFFERENT LES SCHWAB BECAUSE THIS OWNER DOESN'T CARE EITHER)</text>< Rate>

< Review>
I did my own brake job but one of the front calipers had gotten loose and leaked a little. Took it in hoping they could fix the caliper only. They insisted they had to do a complete front brake job on both sides including turning the rotors. Cost $300. Maybe this is their policy but I think it was a rip off. This was the first brake job on this low mileage vehicle. I know it's better to have the rotors turned each time but they were very clean. Not necessary in my opinion. I probably could have replaced the seal on that cylinder myself but had never done it before so I bit the bullet. Should have shopped around but didn't have time to.< /Review>

I usually go to America's Tire. I have brought 7 of my vehicles to them over the years and replace all my tires through them. I got a flat tire on my truck and brought it them to fix near closing time. I could tell the guy was in a rush to get home and he explained I would need to buy a new tire and that it was not repairable. Going by my gut, I took my truck and flat tire to Les Schwab in Elk Grove, also near closing as I cannot get off work any earlier. They accommodated me, and fixed my flat tire for FREE! They were so backed up, they stayed one hour after closing to get my tire repaired. UNBELIEVABLE customer service!!! I will be bringing ALL my vehicles to Les Schwab from now on. I am very impressed.< /text>

Mechanic came out after a few minutes and asked if I had been having problems, I told him no, I just always get an alignment with a new set.  He informed me that my car was 100% fine and all wheels were within specification.

They didn't even charge me for the check.  Friendly and very importantly HONEST staff.  I'll be back to them for sure.</Review><user_name>Jim Bass<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<review>Horrible, I was there in November for a single front tire replacement and was told at that time I would need front brakes in 2k to 3k miles. Today they said brakes are good, but I said do them anyways, 4.5 hrs. later... time will tell if the work was done well.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I came in win a flat tire in the back of my truck and they aired it up and checked for leaks in just a few minutes. I was informed the tire was ok and that it went flat from just sitting.  For all this I wasn't charged anything. I would recommend  this to anyone in need of a straight answer with regards to a tire issue.< /Review><Date>1511282172937</Date>< name>

Went to get my brakes checked, was told I need front brakes but rears are fine. After they finished replacing the front brakes they told me I need new rear brakes because they are almost done for. Not sure how the mechanic missed that if they are almost done for.</Text>

<Review>Our goto location for tires. They do a great job of customer service and are not pushy about trying to "up sell" something you don't need. The reason for the dropping of a star is the long time it takes. This isn't a negative per se because I understand they are busy, but it is a warning that you'll likely not want to wait.</Review>< pictures>

I took my car in to have my tires rotated and my breaks checked (my breaks were squeaky and I had to push really hard on the pedal to stop the car) I told them I thought that I needed new break pads. They rotated my tires and checked my breaks. They determined that my breaks just needed to be a adjusted and not replaced. They could have easily just changed the break pads and charged me for them especially because I thought that I needed new pads when I brought the car in. But they were honest and didn't charge me for a service I didn't need. I appreciate the honesty!</review>

First of all I want to thank the staff at this location. I had a screw in my front left tire and I took it to Tire pros first as they have been my tire repair place for awhile. In the past they said one of my tires puncture was to close to the edge so they couldn't repair it, so I plugged it, when the plugged failed after month or so I brought it back and they said the same thing so I had them replace it. I took my truck to them today because I had a screw in it and they said the same thing. I decide not to replace it and had them put the tire back on and went to LesSchwab.  I talk to one of the staff tire mechanics and he said he would check it out. He did and he repaired it! Not only that, but they didn't't charge me one cent for the repair! You put action behind your statement " Doing the right thing since 1952" Thank you for your hard work and honesty, it means allot theses days. You have earned my business.

Straight forward, comfortable if you have to wait. I like the deals when you purchase the tires, they will fix a flat, rotate the tires, balance and check the air for you anytime.  First come, first serve.</text>

<pics>None< /pics><text>Very disappointed and let down by bad service at 2 locations. My experience started in Lake Tahoe. We had a blow out on the way up so I bought 2 tires to replace the blown tire and the other bad tire and would replace the other 2 once at home. Leaving the Lake Tahoe store the low tire light was on so I went back and was told it should turn off in a few miles, well it never did after 15 miles so I stopped to get air and gas. The other 2 tires were also low on air apparently the tire pressure was never checked even though I was told otherwise. Then when I had the other 2 tires put on in Elk Grove my wife noticed that the car shaked at higher speeds, well the car needed a 90k service and so I went back to Les Schwab to get service but was told they only do tires. So off to the dealer I went let down that LS didn't even change oil. At the dealer they informed me that the lug nuts holding the right side tires on were put on backwards and that's most likely why the car had a shake. Sure enough after they rotated the tires and I drove it no more shake the mechanic took a picture and shared it with me so I could see. Very let down by Les Schwab and now I don't even trust them to touch my car.</text></record>

I was helped by Niema who was friendly, knowledgeable , gave me the information I needed and made sure all my questions were answered and thanked me for my repeat business.

<review>Bad experience with Les Schwab again.... :( 10 years ago I had a bad experience with a different location and now at this location is again really bad customer service. I had brakes done over the weekend and insisted that I needed my tires rotated. The person "ALEX" didn't write my information down and I called him back after the brake inspection. I mentioned to please rotate my tires AGAIN. They had my car for 4 hours and I talked to ALEX again and he mentioned that he FORGOT? This would not have been a big deal but I was going out of town for a long drive and now I need to get this done somewhere else. THANKS ..........Alex........you SUCK!< /review></record>

When I went back to have mine fixed, the cashier was very rude and accused me of trying to get something for free. Lol. They don't stand behind their work.

Don't take your car here for any brake repairs, you will be taken advantage of.

My wife was about to go on a long road trip, so I wanted to replace the brake pads on our 2013 Sonata. She called me and said that they would replace the pads, resurface the rotors, and flush the brake fluid for $270. I thought the price was a little much, but I wouldn't have the time to do the brakes before her trip, so I said get it done.

When I get home, I look at the bill, and realized they charged us $160 for brake calipers. What? I asked my wife if they ever mentioned that to her, she talked to 2 different people and said no one said anything about replacing calipers.

I was fairly sure the calipers were good, my car is only 3 years old. I call them to verify. They said, "whenever brake pads are replaced the calipers should be replaced too." I called B.S., being that I went to an automotive technical school and spent 3 years in a shop. I told him the calipers don't need to be replaced unless they aren't performing properly (i.e. leaking fluid, piston is sticking, etc.) You can't get better parts than the OEM. My calipers were only 3 years old and they replaced them with 2 - REFURBISHED calipers for $160.

He said, without replacing the calipers they wouldn't have been able to give me their warranty which comes free with their brake repair. Obviously, it wasn't free Steve, considering I had to spend $160 on remanufactured calipers. Then he tried saying it was a "liability issue." Really? Because I could've taken my car to the Elk Grove Auto Mall and gotten just the pads replaced and the rotors machined, and it would probably have been cheaper, and I still would have gotten a warranty, and I wouldn't have spent $160 on two junky calipers.

I'm not sure if they sell you two calipers just to meet a sales quota at the end of the month, or maybe the stereotype is true and they just tried to take advantage of a girl taking her car in to get the brakes replaced, especially when you consider they didn't even mention the replacement of my near new calipers over the phone.

Either way, I will no longer to business with Les Schwab, and I'll be sure to post this on social media, and inform all of my friends of the poor communication, unnecessary charges, and subpar service that we experienced at Les Schwab.</Text>

Not sure of this place. Want a supreme pack but for some reason the took the price of a regular pack and then added $9.60 to make it a supreme. Dont get online making a supreme pack is just 1 more. This is the second time they messed with the prices. Giving 2 stars cause it tasted good but was skimpy in the serving size.< /Text>

This is my favorite taco bell location I have ever been to. The employees are very friendly, the food is cheap and they make it really quick (if the drive though isnt really packed). I will definitely be back to this location again.</text>

<review>The Nachos Party pack is a straight rip off!  Between your menu changes and this catastrophe of a product, I'm not sure if I can ever return to this establishment.  Not only were the chips bare but I feel like there was simply no effort to make it look as though this is worth $12 bucks shared or not...poor execution and just a bad overall experience.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT< /review>< response>

This location is really hit or miss. I usually only post positive reviews, but I have been disappointed so many times by this Taco Bell. Employees are friendly and kind, but the line moves slow and my order is nearly always wrong. I have probably visited about 9 times and had 2 correct orders. Sometimes, I get someone else's food or they add an ingredient that was requested not to have. I have gotten cheese, but no chips for the nachos... Twice.

I want to love this location. It is so convenient, so I'll keep trying.</text>

Fast, efficient, and accurate.  The young woman working the drive thru window was incredibly nice and respectful...a pleasant change from the level of service you normally get at a drive thru.  Well done across the board!< /review>

Got our size drink wrong!!! We even asked them if it was the right size and they said it was but they gave us a small instead of a large. Then we call them to tell them and they tell us to go back to get our right size.  We get there and they say we have to pay for the drink again in order to get our right size.< /text>

Everything was out of order, everything I wanted in a burrito box was wrong, incorrect toppings, they forgot a whole taco too... not a very pleasant experience.</text>

I have been looking for a specific piece for my drum set for about two Months and  I thought I would have to go all the way to Gilroy just to find it. Salinas music 123 is a great alternative to having to travel anywhere else. Very affordable prices and a very diverse lineup of  products and the help there is phenomenal.  Most  definitely will be coming back<//Review>

First of all, Music 123 is definitely better with their customers than the Monterey Music Store.
(Monterey Music Store would get 0 stars from me tbh.)
But ultimately here's my honest opinion on Music 123:
It's about an average musical instrument shop
Employees seem more interested in their phones and there's 1 employee that knows very little about electric guitars when asked if they had certain items or if they can special order an item.
Tbh I'd still stop by if I was in an emergency and needed strings or any accessories in a hurry on a Monday (when Wise Music is closed.)
I prefer to buy local, so maybe I'll give this shop another chance.
Until then, I'm gonna have to give you guys 3 stars.
(The main thing that kept me from rating a 2 was your selection of guitar and bass strings!)
Maybe my next visit will change the rating.
I'm really hoping so.  You guys got great potential.
My update could be a 4 or even a 5 star experience.  But we will see.
This is just my honest experience and opinion.</Text>

I have gone in there 4 times in the last six weeks. Recently, I took up the trumpet again after being away from the instrument for 30 years. I bought myself a student model that has worked well these last few months but now I am looking to upgrade my trumpet from the student model to a King Silver Flair 2055t. As I stated above, I have gone into this establishment several times, explained what I was looking for and was told someone would call. Nobody ever has. With customer service like this, I find it to be simply amazing that they are still in business. The only reason I gave them one star is because I can't give them zero.
...
You say that you have tried to call me but yet there are no messages on my phone. I will not contact you again and I certainly will not ever be back in your store.<//Text>

<Text>I walked in and I had to say hi to them because the  two men standing there just stared at me without saying anything. I got a weird vibe from this place.  Definitely not stepping foot in this store again.</Text>< username>

<review>(Translated by Google) Bad service! ....... what a disappointment, before there was another friendly staff that helped you! The new doesn't even greet you. I was going to buy a guitar with an amplifier but for bad attention I went to another place, I would never go back to that place, they have to attend to the customers well.

<rating>5</rating><review>My family and I love this place. The owners, Theresa and her chef husband, are awesome. Theresa hand rolls the won tons for their soup daily and everything is so fresh. If you have a favorite Asian dish and it's not on the menu, ask them!  99% of the time they will make it for you.

I'm was very excited to see that they are still open, especially during these hard times. I'm happy to drive out of the way to support this local business. Great location, friendly owners that know your name and what you want to order as soon as they see you walk in, and of course delicious food.<//review>< pictures>

Centrally located in downtown Martinez, the Canton Restaurant is quiet, cozy and the food and service is spot on. Food portions were generous. We visited on 10/15/19 and had the lunchtime specials. I had the Cashew Chicken and my guest had the Sweet and Sour Pork. My guest and I both commented on how savory the soup was. I was expecting the traditional tofu hot/sour soup; however the soup we were served was a bit different. It had small chunks of tomatoes in a savory tomato based stock along with small chunks of tofu and bean sprouts. It was very delicious and took the chill off the cool autumn afternoon. We both chose the pork chow mein instead of the fried rice.  The accompanying spring roll was perfectly crisp and fresh (but it would have been nice to have some sweet sour sauce to dip it in).  There was an abundance of cashews in the Cashew Chicken and the zucchini and sugar snap peas were fresh and crisp, not at all overcooked. We also had a pot of hot tea.

I recommend this restaurant for its food, service and ambience. My only regret is that we didn't sit in the window seat overlooking the street.< /review>

<userid>105426647877382707204<//userid><Date>1590277320793< /Date><text>I rode my motorcycle to Martinez recently on a random to see where the front wheel took me.

Finding myself starving and many businesses closed due to C19, I figured I would go back to Pleasant Hill where I started and go to Wendy's.

Canton in downtown MZ was open and I walked in and ordered Mongolian chicken to go (obv).  I got a small order of rice with it and walked out and ate the whole thing on the seat of my bike - using it as a makeshift table.

It was delicious and I didn't ride off needing more food.  $13 bucks very well spent.  I walked back in to thank the owners for taking the chance of being open.

Good ppl.  Give them a try.  BTW, piles of meat in my box.  Not the usu move of a few pieces of meat mixed into a farm of onions and bell peppers and what not.

I will be back!  Next time I will take a pic of the food and post.< /text></record></dataset><record>

It's our favourite family restaurant.  We have 5 kids and they always love their food. Clean, fresh food to order. Their food is not greasy, we love to order the family meal. And we always go home with extra.</Review>

<Review>Authentic, delicious food. Satiating servings; excellent specials.  Named after the old City of Canton, which is now Guangzhou, China, but this restaurant serves the finest pre-Mao plates.

Really not very happy but last time the ingredients tasted very old. 2 people eat with me and everybody had same problem, so it is not me. The place was empty and did not smell like a restaurant. Did not smell like food at all. Kind of weird. Well, form your own opinion, don't just judge based on this.
I just arrived home and I threw away the food leftovers. It smelled weird and tasted funny. First time I give on star to a restaurant ever.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We both ordered the one person special ($9.95 each) and it all tasted burnt as if they used the same pan to cook it in with something burnt on the bottom. She said we can pay for our tea and soda and our soup (one was not eaten) and we paid $10 for just soup and two drinks.< /text>

A sleepy little town but, a very good Chinese restaurant.  Was surprisingly good.  The hot and sour was a bit different than ive had before.  The meat dish was very tender.  All the dishes had very good flavor.  We took Amtrak and walked over.  If your in town and need a quick, good, meal, then here you go.<//text>

🤢😷🤒👎👎👎👎👎First, walked in at noon and the place was empty and no aroma of anything being cooked. 👀 I told my sister we should leave but she insisted. We ordered a dinner for two which had some options. The cook was pulling stuff from a fridge that looked suspect and a deli counter. The sweet and sour pork was awful, the sauce was burnt. I literally had to spit it out.?the beef was chewy, we ate the won-ton soup and left the rest. 👎 No we do not want to box this up! 😒 We still paid full price and didn't complain.

This has to be the worse Chinese restaurant I've ever experienced before. I don't like to give businesses bad reviews but the food was terrible. The two people working there, they were nice but the food 🤢🤢🤢🤢</text>

<review>Definitely the best Chinese in Martinez. They are welcoming and friendly, the food was delicious,  and it was done in the time it took to walk around the block catching Pokémon. The small carrying handles on the takeout boxes were a huge plus too, don't see those too often.<//review>< pics>

Super crappy food. Not good, very greasy, the orange chicken tasted like 2 day old fried chicken that had been microwaved and then they poured orange sauce over it. Nasty don't waste your time. there's a good panda express across town.</text>

Just got done eating there. My wife called dibs on the front bathroom. We're currently waiting on food poisoning to set in. My garlic chicken, and the wife's Mongolian beef, were both pre-cooked. Our meals came out within 7-8 minutes. Slow down, take a little time and cook fresh food please.<//Review>

I didn't know until I return home and calculate it. Secondly, the cook was confrontational and didn't understand what an itemized receipt was. He said " I don't care about Obamacare, it's the law. The law is not made by YOU!" All I need was an itemized receipt to keep track of my spending.  Ladtly, their fortune cookies was open and place on a dirty tray. If I get sick I will report them to  the  BBB. PLEASE DON'T EAT THERE. IF YOU DO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ORDER. If I could give a rating under 1 star I would.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>This is as good a place for casual chinese food as you will find in the Diablo Valley. Family oriented and very friendly owners work hard to serve quality food at budget friendly prices. Next time you are in downtown Martinez stop in and find out for yourself.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80856f8469bbb4d1:0xab207cd46f22bc92</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The decor is a little old and frayed, but the pork buns and the potstickers were homemade and delicious.< /Text>

This is a fantastic place to get a workout in. They have a variety of cardio machines, weight machines and free weights.
Additionally, they have a decent sized locker room with showers and they have massage machines as well. Friendly staff. Good hours. I like this place and am looking forward to going back now that I’m fully vaccinated and have waited out the time for full vaccination to take full effect.<//Review>

< review>
The staff are  warm and friendly. I wonder if the people complaining about how “rude” etc the staff are have actually taken a moment to simply ask. Every time I have had a question, the staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. As far as the equipment. Sometimes the equipment is not working or not properly maintained BUT this is always temporary and to be expected at any public gym. There’s usually paper towels and always disinfectant spray, I personally take my own disinfectant towels as well as paper towels and wipe down the equipment/machines I use. The bathroom is a public gym bathroom. It’s not Starbucks. If I didn’t like this place I wouldn’t go so frequently. I suggest bringing your own disinfectant towels to wipe down the equipment and cleaning up after yourself, bring a clean towel if you want to use the aqua massage and ask for help before assuming.< /review>

For $10 a month, I can't really complain since most of the equipment there is fully functional. Management here is friendly and helpful and the group classes that they have in the mornings are fun. I just wish some of the damaged equipment could be repaired quicker.< /review>

Great gym with low rates sign up was super easy and the staff was really helpful. Definitely the best for your money in selma. Only downside is the hours if you're used to working out early morning or late night.< /Text>

Sometimes I feel insecure while I am working out. The tread mill is wobbly as well. Also, they keep charging me extra 5 bucks each month and they do not send me a notification when they pull out money from my account.<//review>

<Text>My list is long. I personally go to a different gym in Az but they dont have them in Selma. My husband uses FR in Selma but  when he comes home to my gym he is reminded how poorly this gym is run.

the list
No customer service on site. When asked about repairs, ac,  cleanliness he was literally told he could go somewhere else.

Broken equipment CONSTANTLY
Lack of working equipment/ heavy weights
Ac rarely works or  turned on in 100+ degree weather

No disinfectant/ paper towels to disinfect ( he brings his own)

No customer service / corporate number to communicate for concerns or complaints. When emailed corporate they show LITTLE concern for safety, cleanliness or customer service.

My husband is far nicer than I. I would have left immediately however in that area there are not many decent options.

Yall should call EOS encourage them to open in your area. Best gym EVER . Great value, insanely awesome equipment,  pool, movie theater, child care for $10 if he had an EOS close we would switch in a heart beat.

FR split from an AZ based company here in AZ and honestly not really welcome or wanted here because of such poor moral and business ethic! In addition they are NOT registered with BBB which is a huge red flag. BBB monitors amd reports for public info and accountability< /Text>< pictures>

This place has been getting more and more packed, even before summer vacation started. It's reached a point where I have to wait to use almost any piece of equipment no matter what time I show up. The staff working the counter is very nice. my only gripes would be that the heavy bag was never replaced and that the place has become overcrowded, despite that is good for business, I know quite a few people who are being pushed away by it. I ended up getting a very condescending response when I left a review on Facebook instructing me that there are sister locations. I'm not looking to drive an extra hour just to get a workout in. I'm just going to end up getting my own setup to not have to deal with the crowds. I go into work out and get stuff done. The gym is maintained very well, but we all have busy lives and have stuff to do.

The next part I have a gripe with is how they notify members that the gym is closed. I recommended that they put signs on the doors and windows notifying people as far in advance as they could. It's put on the app however there's a problem with that. This is also part of the condescending response I got on Facebook. Within the application, you are not able to select a preferred location and get pop-up notifications on your phone letting you know that your preferred location is/will be closed. If the application was updated with that the, once again, condescending response I got would have been valid.

I run a business myself and I know that making money has to be your top priority, but management seems to be very money hungry to the point of locking a good level of respect for their clientele. The amazing treatment we get from their staff doesn't hide that anymore</text>

The manage and "assistant" didn't close my account correctly so my bank account was still being charged. This is for anyone wanting wanting to get a membership there, if you get a membership and later decided to cancel, make sure to keep all documents and make sure all accounts are closed CORRECTLY because they will continue to charge and to get a refund for their mistakes is a nightmare. I spoke with corporate because the assistant basically made it seem like it was my fault for not closing out the account correctly. They are rude!</text>

Alot of people that come here are straight up rude and wierd. Always stareing and walking around as if they own the place. They make me want to switch to a different location. I have been here at many different times and it is always the same issue. Some staff members are cool others are not. They can be very pushy for membership upgrades or sign ups and do not act professional if you upgrade or sign up with someone else. Kind of ridiculous that if your paying $49 a month for a membership you still have to pay an annual fee of $39. If you able to make the drive to a location or gym in Fresno or near by do so, they are much better. Update, been here for over a year, and it gets worse and worse, machines take for ever to get fixed. Whats the point of having janitorial if they walk around like slugs and the gym stays filthy. I can litteraly draw smiley faces on all the equipment from all the dust and sweat on them.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

No wonder this place is always so busy. Not only is the staff incredibly friendly and courteous, they do an amazing/thorough job on your vehicle. They make sure to tell you about any deals they have as well. I have been searching for a good place to make my go to for all of my vehicle needs and I definitely found it. 10/10 would recommend!<//Review>

Professional and courteous. Technician listened to the services I needed and didn’t try to sell me additional services or products. I was given the option to stay in my vehicle, or allow one of the technicians to drive it into the service bay. Thank you!</Text>

< Review>
I came in for an oil change and tire rotation and everything seemed alright until I started driving home. While driving, I thought I heard a faint metal scratch but was unsure until I went over a speed bump. The metal scratch was very prominent like I had gotten into a car crash. I pulled over and looked under my car, only to realize that my skid plate was left over and was dragging on the ground. I immediately went back to jiffy lube and asked the technicians to install the skid plate back properly. The technician stated that my skid plate was not inserted into the lip which caused the skid plate to fall to the ground. The situation could have been far worse where my skid plate ripped off completely. Thank goodness that I was driving through a residential street when I realized the mistake and not on the freeway.< /Review>

The group of young men who were working the day I visited were acting like clowns. Very unprofessional. First, they told me my visit would not take longer than 40 minutes.... 75 minutes later, they were out in the garage snapping towels and not working on my car at all. It also took me asking about my brakes for them to realize that they did not, in fact, rotate my tires despite charging me for the service. A promise of window cleaning and interior vacuuming of my vehicle were also not met.... Don’t waste your time.</text>

<text>The workers are definitely respectful but they asked if I wanted my tail lights replaced. I said yes. About thirty minutes later a guy comes up and says I have some bad news. They locked my keys in the trunk of the car. After a long wait they finally retrieved my keys.

<rating>1< /rating><text>The oil change service itself was good as always but while I was waiting, I was told that I had to wear a mask which wouldn't have bothered me if the employees were all wearing masks and the other customers were given the same direction. I went to the waiting area without a mask and was told that I had to wear one so I went back to my truck to get one. After I was told that they were required, an employee came into the waiting area to get water and didn't have a mask and I saw a couple of other employees in the bay without a mask. Then a girl came in for service and was not wearing a mask and nothing was said to her about it. Maybe if I was a 20 something girl or an employee, I wouldn't have been told that I was required to have a mask but since I am neither it was required. It's not the requirement that upset me but I am extremely frustrated that the rules apply differently depending on who you are or what you look like. I think that's called discrimination but I will have to confer with a lawyer to confirm.< /text>< Pictures>

A lot more expensive than Wal mart for a synthetic oil change, but the service was fast and friendly. If you don't mind paying double the price (and that's with a coupon), then this is a great place to go. If you need to save money, Wal Mart is less than half the price for the same brand of synthetic oil.</review>

I’m out of town working and work truck needed oil. Went and got it done and the sales person had decent skills and I ended up agreeing to a couple of services which cost and a lot more that didn’t. Would I go back if I get a coupon better than 7 off especially when my tax was 3 times that. Thanks guys and gal.</Text>

I initially went in to have my AC looked at. It starts blowing cool, but then warms. They notified me that their AC diagnostic equipment was  not working.  However, they never offered to check associated fuses, check pressure of compressor or any other myriad of issues that may be a source of the problem. Today, when I went to check the fuses myself, I noticed they did not replace a cap within the engine, and left it sitting sandwiched between the fuse box and the hood. Also the rubber sealing was pulled off in a section-- again not put back into place. It just seemed like very lazy "work."

The guys were very professional. They cleaned my windows, showed me the filter on my truck and asked me if I'd like to keep it or replace it while telling me the filter looks in good condition and I could replace it the next time I get another oil change. All options were given and explained to me. I'll certainly go back there to get my next oil change.</Text>< pics>

Thanks to Vince for a wonderful experience! From the second we pulled up he waved us in & had us at ease immediately. He went over every thing they found with no pressure to add anything. He took care of us better then any other place we've been to. I overheard another employee going over the same stuff with another customer & she was just as amazing. Everyone we interacted with was so nice. Will be using their services for all our needs they can handle. Thank you!< /Review>

Stopped in for a full synthetic oil change as usual at mileage on my work truck. Day after heard my power steering pump whining so I got out and checked it.... Completely bone dry. As I do have a slight leak from the power steering system, this was the day after and it was obviously not topped of or even checked. I worked at this Jiffy Lube years ago in high school and with the wait time I incurred, know there is a lack of man power or just plain quality control going on as of late.<//text>
<Response>{'time': 1583620552241, 'text': "Thanks for the review Taylor, we appreciate the feedback. We take our reviews very seriously and in reviewing your service invoice, you did not mention your power steering system had a leak. If we were not made aware of the leak, then there's no guarantee it would get checked and or filled as you only requested an oil change. I know we make mistakes from time to time, but with your vehicle having over 260,000 miles on it and you know a pre-existing leak to begin with, blaming us with a one star review doesn't seem fair in this matter.\nI would like to talk with you directly about your concerns, please email me: mattg @ jiffylubeca.com (no spaces in the email address). I look forward to talking with you, have a nice weekend - Matt"}</Response>< UserId.>

I always get treated well here, and have been bringing all my cars for a few years now.  My only complaint is that they don't carry the air filters for my 2 newest vehicles.  The manager is super, though, and it's not like I can't change my own air filter.< /Review>

Really good service. They now do more than just oil changes. They perform a check on minor areas on your car. Such as tires, wipers  lights, and more I cannot think of right now. They even vacuum the inside. You will receive a postcard in the mail to discount your next service. They even give top off on all fluids for free until your next time. They have most parts in stock.</Text>

They were all very nice from the second I pulled in, But it is a bit pricey for just an oil change (with windows washed and vacuuming)</review>

They told me that my transmission fluid was leaking but that they could not tell me exactly what was broken because they would not take it out. So I made an appointment at the Chevy dealer for them to look at it. $200 later and they told me they had no idea what I was talking about as I had no kind of fluid leaks anywhere, but that this Jiffy Lube has missed other glaring, major  issues with my car. Needless to say this Jiffy Lube was a waste of my time and money and I will never be going back. One time and one multiple mistakes were enough for me.<//Text>

I did not get my vehicle serviced here but I was going to unfortunately my schedule did not fit in to the wait time they were experiancing a high volume at the time. So they directed me to another shop that did.
For that they have gained my respect and trust the guy said "after all we are jiffy lube and if I can't get you in, in a  jiffy I will help you find a place that can"< /review>

Very professional.  Serviceman ran out to greet me and gave me thorough explanations of what they were going to do.  Serviceman gave me inspection findings and quotes to perform service without any high pressure tactics.  I felt as though my car was being looked at by someone who knew what they were doing unlike a kid at a big box store.<//Review>

Never come here. I went to Jiffy Lube to have my oil changed. Once they changed my oil and I was driving back  home I immediately noticed my car acting strange. It drove really rough and sort of felt like it was bouncing. In the 6 months that I've had my car it has NEVER done this before. While I was at a stop, my car wouldn't accelerate so I had to turn it off and turn it back on to get it to go. After this I went home and checked my oil and I didn't see anything on the stick but having no experience with cars and not really knowing what the oil should look like I didn't really know what to think.When I went back to jiffy lube they looked at my car for awhile (in an area where I couldn't see what they were doing under my hood) and they told me "NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR." On my way home my car worked perfectly. I went home and checked my oil and the stick was dripping with oil. Being a young girl I feel as if they took advantage of me because they knew that I had known absolutely nothing about cars. They lied to me and denied making any mistakes. I would have respected them a lot more if they just had told me they had made a mistake. Moral of the story, they have no respect for people so bring your cars elsewhere< /Review>

I get there and they tell me it would be 15-20 min for an oil change then she tells me I need to rotate the tires and it would only be an extra 10 min so I say okay but in reality it took 55 min I honestly wouldn’t have mined if they just told me how long it would really be< /text>

<Review>The girl helping with the front, had great customer service. But since jiffy lube doesn’t do alignments, I took it to a mechanic after my oil change, to have them do it.
My diagnosis with jiffy lube was that everything was fine including wheels and air, brakes and pads etc, everything was as it should be.
Upon taking to the other mechanic I found out that all my tires were below pressure, back brakes were at 2mm (need to be changed ASAP), my power steering pump is broke, and my struts are broke and need new ones.
I will NEVER return for service here again!!!   Can’t imagine if I didn’t go to the other mechanic, what could have happened to me in the car, thinking that everything is ok...</Review>< Pics>

The crew at Jiffy Lube did a great job and were very courteous.

< review>
HORRIBLE place!!!  SCAMMERS!!!I DO NOT recommend getting any services from Jiffy Lube.  On June 22, 2017, I took my car there for an oil change.  They suggested that I also have my air filter changed and they told me the filter was filthy.  I spent almost $80 altogether.  This past Sunday, I was on my way home from a store and my four year old daughter was with me.  We were traveling on Helen Power Drive when my vehicle just stopped! Thank goodness I was able to move it to the side of the street before it cut off completely.  Of course with it being Sunday, when I called my insurance company I was on hold for thirty minutes.  I had my young child with me, it was approaching 100 degrees outside so I called a local towing company.  To make a long story short, Firestone was able to diagnose that my car needed an air filter--the same filter that SUPPOSEDLY Jiffy Lube put in my car!

They are scammers and liars!  When I spoke to the manager, Vince, he smiled his way through my complaint.  He didn't seem to care at all that if my car had stopped on the highway, my daughter and I could have been killed.  He smiled and didn't even offer an apology for their inept service.

I filed a complaint with Consumer Affairs Automotive division and I'm still waiting to hear back from Jiffy Lube's Regional Manager.  This is a company that does not put the customer first!</review>

I was the only customer sitting in my car in the rain waiting to be helped. Watching the workers standing around and nobody noticed me. Even though they had told me an hour earlier it would be 30-40. Didn't even care that I was not happy</review>

MAN!!!! Very very very good service. Fast and friendly. Greeted me and my wife at the door. Our car is a little beat up but no judging faces or anything. They checked everything right in front of us and offered water/coffee. Almost didn't want to leave!!!! This is not the cheapest place but for the service I will pay that price everytime.<//review>

<Review>Fantastic place.  They are all about customer service, let you know what you should be doing at each milage intreval, but don't push it on you.  Even for a simple oil change, they had me in right away, showed me my current (extremely dirty) air filter -- which no place had ever done before.  They went over all charges before they started, made fresh coffee, offered water, and kept me updated on how long it would take.  Handing over my car someone checked every cap in front of me before closing the hood, I've never seen that done at any other place before either!  Definitely found my new go-to place.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80853d4dc0a9d725:0x38f3d164a1de9f78< /Gmap_id></record>

<Name>Wayne Ingraham< /Name><date>1287658123737<//date><rate>5<//rate><Text>I needed to take my vehicle in for an oil change today (started 'feeling' like it was a bit overdue), it was getting late and when I arrived it was 10 minutes to 6 (which after looking at the time, I thought I might be pushing it).

When I drove up, someone came right out to see me, I asked if it was too late to get an oil change, he was very nice and said, "not at all", showed me the lobby (held the door) and offered coffee/water. Being a business owner myself, it felt extremely good to be greeted with a customer service at a level I thought had been altogether lost! It seemed as if all the people there too actually enjoyed their work and wanted to provide good service. The manager took my details and was very polite and did not 'push' any additional services that I did not want, yet still let me know of what they had to offer.

When all was said and done, they showed me the other things they had checked and said goodbye as I left. It was like a full service gas station from the 50s. I had never been to that Jiffy Lube prior, but will definitely be back in the future.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>The Vacaville Jiffy Lube is the only place I feel comfortable taking my car. The employees are absolutely amazing; they're honest, knowledgeable, and genuinely make us customers feel at home. It may not be the cheapest place to get your oil changed, but the exceptional customer service and quality of work (along with the many available discounts) makes the Vacaville Jiffy Lube the ONLY place I go to for all my preventative maintenance and repair needs.<//review>< pictures>

Called to get  A price on an oil change And was told my truck takes 8 courts lol Sorry Bud but a 96 Chevy tahoe with a 5.7 only takes 5 to 5 1/2 . 6 at the Max.  I was a shop manager at a tire and mechanic shop in Fairfield. And I do all my work on my own cars but just decided to be lazy today... But I will tell you what I definitely will not take it somewhere where they don't know the  Specifications  And just throw out numbers.. Not very professional..<//review>

I appreciate that Jiffy Lube also does a five-point personalcheck on the entire car.UPDATE4/27/19.it's been 600 miles since my last oil change and I checked my dipstick and the oil smells burnt and black I feel they never even changed my oil I won't be going back.< /review>

< review>
They serve Three Twins ice cream. Service was good and they give samples in this era of COVID. That's not so common in this 2021 timeframe. They also included the waffle cone slice with the ice cream scoop at no extra charge.

I liked their sandwich board though -- see photos.

4 stars only because the ice cream is a brand you can find at other places.< /review>

Why does the shop smell so AMAZING? Because they make their own waffle cones. Please go here and get their homemade waffle cones with any kind of ice cream, just go ahead and get 2 scoops, you deserve it.</Text>

Our church in LA has a yearly retreat to my old college in Angwin. And every time we have to make sure to visit this place at least once. Best ice cream in the US, definitely with the waffle cone. We missed last year because of COVID and might not get to go again this year, only time can tell, so I've been craving their ice cream so bad. Lemon Cookie!!!<//Review>

We stopped in with our two kids and received terrible customer service. My son was handed his cone and he went to take a normal lick (not rough in any way) and his scoop immediately fell right off the cone onto the floor. It was right in front of the employee and extremely obvious that it was due to it not being pushed onto the cone properly. My husband picked it up and threw it out and she asked if we wanted another scoop so we said yeah assuming she was just replacing it. When she told us the total I questioned why it was so much and she said well we have to charge you for the dropped scoop. She then went on to say that if he had dropped it outside she would have replaced it but since it was inside the store she couldn’t, which makes even less sense. The fact that it fell right off, first lick, shows it was their fault. I questioned her and she again said sorry we have to charge you. Unbelievable, that is a terrible way to treat a customer.< /review>

<review>This place is great. I brought my baby sister here a few months ago because it was the summer and toddlers love ice cream, right?
She got her typical vanilla ice cream and I had a scoop of mint chip and a scoop of cardamom ice cream.
The quality of the ingredients is unmatched in any of the ice cream shops in the Valley.
Ill admit, the ice cream is on the pricier side, so expect to spend $20 on a few scoops of ice cream like I did.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8084430961f8f41f:0xe983dacfabd96939<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>We drive from Napa several times every summer to have ice cream at Calistoga Creamery. It's always delicious and feels like a more special treat than a regular scoop and waffle cone.

Great! I visited on a very warm day and needed something cold and refreshing. Great I've cream flavors -- really liked the cardamom -- and the bottled water was cold cold cold! People got to taste before they bought and the two that were working there this afternoon we're very patient and accommodating. Thanks!</text>

<Review>The milk shakes are great!, but for $8, I'd expect at least the full mixer cup. (You get maybe 8 oz?).

Get rid of the recycled newspaper straws. They taste like ... newspaper, and are a piss poor offering when asking this kind of cash.

I imagine the ice cream cones to be a better option, but I think I'll stick with the joint across the street.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Small store, but appropriatrly sized for a touristy town with a decent flow of people. Now for the creamery offerings: all the flavors tried at the counter are definitely creamery worthy, rich and flavorful. I couldn't find a fake flavor if I tried. Not the stuff that is in the big box stores labeled as "creamery or creamery style". Definitely worth a stop if your in the area. Great little dessert spot or something to calm the sweet tooth craving.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x8084430961f8f41f:0xe983dacfabd96939<//gmap_id></record>

The ice cream is delicious and the scope is generous. The only issue I have is that the employee did not use a paper covering or gloves to prevent her hands from touching my cone. Very unsanitary when I wanted to eat the cone.<//Text>

Nice organic ice cream. They have gluten free cones and no dairy ice cream. Loved the salted caramel and cardamom flavors. Friendly staff. Conveniently located in the main street. Parking is convenient too.< /review>

The sign on the door advertised that they were open until 9:30, I showed up at 9:20, employees were inside and completely ignored me.</review>

Very tasty and great service. A must if you go to Calistoga. It offers a gluten free cone. A great plus for people who need this. The variety is poor and the difference in flavors is not too wide but it is my favorite ice cream place.<//Review>

I'm a new local resident and I love their lemon cookie ice cream. Unfortunately I didn't have the greatest experience there. I wanted a pint of ice cream of the lemon cookie and went there to get a pint. There was older lady and a young girl working there. I asked the younger girl if they had a pint size I can buy she said yes the older lady said no they don't but the younger girl mentioned that it was in their computer. While the two girls were looking for the pint-sized cup the older lady found a 10 oz cup and said oh yeah this is our pint size and was adamant of it when I questioned her again. I paid $9 for a 10 oz cup of ice cream that wasn't even full to the rim. When I got to my car I was talking to my husband about it and he told me a pint is 16 oz which I didn't even think anything of it on how many ounces are in a pint when I was at the ice cream creamery. A week later my husband went to Cal Mart next door to the ice cream creamery and found a pint of the lemon cookie ice cream same brand Three Twins... The pint of ice cream at the store was $4.99 he told me there are different flavors there too. So now I know if I want a pint of ice cream for $4.99 I can get it at the store instead of going to the creamery and pay $9 for a 10 oz cup.< /Text>

Delicious lite icecream. Not too heavy. Just right. Never tasted better anywhere else. We've considered visiting Calistoga again just for this place. Homemade waffle cones are 2nd to none.<//text>

If you want ice cream, milkshake, or sorbet (local lemon and 2017 vintage blackberry) while in Calistoga end the search here.  What sets this apart from other places is perfectly done - in house waffle cones and owner who passion for perfect execution.  Home made sorbet and Three Twins ice cream.<//review>

<Review>It's a mixed bag. The one off of Douglas usually has a long line on Tuesday (Value taco night) but it's worth it if you endure the wait. You unfortunately I rolled through the drive thru today (Apr 6) and was greeted by the guy saying the card reader was not working. I rolled my eyes, but understood since it was busy. Ended up going to T bell down the street.

Usually I like saying a dollar here on Tuesday/Thursdays, (Chicken taco night) sadly the long wait and inconvenient Card Reader error is making it hard for me to want to stop by this DT just to wait 15 minutes, to hear I can't use my card.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>I think they skipped training for the employees here. They were lacking quickness, customer service skills...and a decent amount of toppings on my food, definitely not worth the money going to this location. The Arden way & Howe ave location is so much better.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< rate>

<review>Keep your order simple, the workers seem to get the order wrong about 25% of the time so stick to simple items. For instance, order 1 item from value menu. Don't order a combo.  This is from my experience using the drive thru.<//review><date>1616798831283<//date><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

<review>Ordered their grilled chicken tacos, the sauce that comes on it tasts just like mayo and it came on only one side of the taco. Although that part happened to be a good thing because i ripped that side off, if the sauce tasted better then mayo i would have been more unsatisfied.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Make sure you have them scan coupons that require a $5 total purchase First, then use any $3 ones, then use free item coupons next. Always scan highest first, in that order in order to get massive discounts! Happy eating 😊<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Missing items, cold fries, broken shake machine, and out of ice coffee. Worse del taco experience I've ever had. Will not be back!

Edit: General manager called and offered a make up meal, was a better experience but not perfect. All my items we're shoved into one bag and there was still a missing item. At least when I went back this time they had ice coffee and the french fries were hot. Earned a bump up to three stars from me. Still needs improvement.</Text><Resp>None</Resp><Rating>3</Rating>< user_name>

Listen folks, it's cheap fast food. I think it's good considering the price point. Also, expect a long wait on Tuesday and Thursday evenings possibly 20 mins+ in drive-through. I knew what I was getting into, but I just play on my phone while I wait to move up in line. I like the crispy chicken tacos, reminds me of the mcd's snack wrap, maybe better. I like their chicken more than their beef imo. You decide for yourself but don't judge too harshly, because for me, the value tips the scales to good.< /Review>

Went there for the Beyond meat menu, but they couldn't make half of the items because the menu changed... We just wanted an Epic Cali with Beyond, but they could only do the meat ones. We like meat, but we wanted to try out the Beyond menu so it was a frustrating experience. The outside menu also didn't have a screen to let us know what we ordered and the guy couldn't hear me! Left without a few things we wanted, but the gentleman at the window was nice enough.< /text>

Very similar to "Taco Bell" but with several burgers available on the menu. Fast friendly drive thru with a perfectly filled order. Dollar menu is great!! Easy to navigate location.
Full family approval! Kids enjoyed the burgers and fries while the wife and I enjoyed tacos nachos and chips.
I would rank slightly better than "Taco Bell".. "Del Taco" had more of a "fresh" taste in my opinion and a less expensive alternative.
Will definately return again soon!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Another Del taco destination that did not disappoint. This Del taco was the freshest and cleanest that I had ever been in. There are vegan options on the menu as well as salads. The customer service was absolutely phenomenal and I got my food very quickly. I usually wait for a spell for my food, however, this location was spot-on Johnny rocket. The food came out clean and quickly. If I am in the mood for cheap Mexican inspired food, I will never go to Taco Bell again. I live one mile away from this location and it will be my location for all of my munchie meals. #420<//text>

<Text>Slow service, waited an extra 10 minutes for cold, floppy re-fries. I thought at least with the wait, the fries would be hot and crispy, instead they were yesterday's fries. Never received a receipt (but they knew I couldn't reference my experience with one). It was at Roseville, today Monday July 27th at about 2:30pm. I feel bad for the crew, obviously they are treated poorly and are paid horribly and that's why they give horrible service and serve up yesterday's food. I would not return to this location for wrinkly, brown, cold fries. Anywhere else is better.< /Text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was ordering through Uber Eats. On the app after I finished choosing what I was going to order, the app said there was something I got that they didn't have anymore. So I called Del Taco to see what that was. The girl was rude and said she couldn't help me. She even got rough when me when I was trying to explain my predicament. Then I just ordered the food anyway, and when I received it. (Which took forever) Everything was cold, and soggy and gross. I called Del Taco, and they said I had to make a complaint through Uber Eats because they were help responsible for the meal if you order through them. REDICULOUSLY RUDE< /review></record>

<text>Today I went to Del Taco after looking online and seeing that they were supposed to be open for Dine in, unfortunately all of the doors were locked. I figured it must be open because there was a child inside running around with food in his hand. When I called the restaurant the rude associate informed me that it was drive thru only. I’m sure that should be advertised<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>They're offering new menu item enchiladas, they were out. Ordered a Del burger, no bun, extra lettuce instead. It was a 1 to 10 pound Patty, overcooked. Very dry to say the least. You know the chalky texture. But I was so hungry. Best thing I ordered was the $1 strawberry lemonade.<//Review>< Pics>

Been going here about once a month for years for fish tacos. This time was very disappointing. Ordered 5 for take out. Got home (about 5 minutes) tacos were cold and had very little taste. Will give them one more try...</text>

<Review>In the drivethru tonight I  pay and the girl asks me to pull around and wait in a parking spot. There's no  car behind me in line. I say, how about I move if someone comes behind me. She says no. I say how long is it going to be? She says less then a minute. I go and park. No other car pulls into the drivethru. Less than a minute later she's walking out to my car with the tacos. I look into bag. No napkins. She's gone. I get out of my car, walk around to the entrance, go inside and wait two minutes for someone to give me a couple of napkins. Weird.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809b201e17a18231:0x629fb84a4f155f02</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Always check your bag because 50% of the time I don't get half my order.  This time they stuffed my 1 bag so full I couldn't check it... low and behold much of the order is missing so I guess I'm going hungry again.< /review>

Good American style mexican food. Decent price and quick service. A lot better tasting fresh food then other similar fast food places.

Rarely have any problems with moding orders to taste. The grilled chicken soft tacos and burrito are way better without the white sauce. They have good marinated grilled chicken, the white sauce kills that flavor, best to exclude the sauce or replace with the red sauce.</text>

Marginal at best. What do you expect for a cheap fast food hole? Burrito was room temperature, fries were stone cold (tossed them out.) Hey, at least I didn't get sick.</Review>

<text>Food is prepared well, offering a good quality at great prices. Staff is very, very casual, both making you feel at home but also potentially comprising professionalism. Still, visiting is like coming to the staff's home for dinner and it's thoroughly unpretentious and welcoming.<//text>< user_name>

<Text>Still one of the strangest fast food concepts out there. It's like that mom and pop burger stand every city has where they make a little of everything but del taco just doesn't do it as well as the mom and pop joint. I've never been to a fast food restaurant and seen multiple people walk in and walk right back out (they were not busy btw) cashier was awkward but maybe just an off day. I will say the place was spotless though< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I think Del Taco stacks up french fries (soggy) to keep the line going or (uncooked) too speedy. Give your people time to deliver perfectly crisp fries...Its the only negative.<//review>

Taco Tuesday Rocks!  But it could be cleaner inside.  Employees are very nice, but a little grungy.  Location invites some of the local transient population which can make for an interesting meal out with the family.   Just wish they had more locations! !<//Text>

Ordered on the app, it was not supposed to be made until I arrived. Order was already there when I arrived and shakes were wrong. Female at window didn't believe when I told her it was wrong. I had to show her the order on my app before getting them remade. chili fries  had made the box and bag soggy,  collapsed when trying to remove.<//Text>

Place was clean and staff was nice but Its a bit ridiculous to add .50 cents per taco for a triple taco order. Not a single taco on the menu came with lettuce cheese tomatoes and sour cream..which is like a standard taco. The grilled chicken in my taco wasn't the greatest. I wouldn't come here again.< /text>

Good food at reasonable prices. Even though there is always a long line of cars at lunch time for the drive-through that goes down the street, it actually moves quickly. It is worth the wait.<//text>

It wasn't very good this time I set in drive-through for 10 minutes at the window. The person work in the window it was their time to get off and they just left me sitting there in a lot of traffic behind me. Other than that it would have been good<//Text>

<Text>Pretty weak. I had a value taco which broke in half immediately, a chicken taco with far too little chicken and far too much sour cream, multiple tacos had wildly scattered ingredients, such as all the cheese clustered on one side. The impossible taco with the avocado was decent but not worth the original price. This is only worth a shot if you have some coupons.<//Text>< Pictures>

The best del taco in the busiest of places. Always fast food that is fresh and that is the del taco way and they do it well. They have long term employees that care. I love the cali steak and quac, any nachos, obviously chicken soft tacos on thursdays cuz theyre cheap and delicious. If you are broke, the $1 grillers are great too. Small dining area but most grab and go here so plenty of room to sit and eat. Breakfast wise grab an epic burrito.... cheap and filling and bomb!<//Review>

I don't know what has occurred here but this location has gone from great to horrible in the past two months. Dirty store, extremely slow service, and cold food. I just waited 45 minutes in the drive thru... There was only 5 cars in it and nobody inside. Employees seemed to be just be sitting around. None of the orders were large.<//text>

Their egg-filled burritos are my favorite breakfast.  I frequently order them in a bowl without the big tortilla and avoid 270 calories of lard and flour (yep, that's what they're made of).  The staff are outstanding and handle my "customized" orders with a smile.</Text>

It's Dell taco! Always a great place to get a tasty meal. The staff here always have provided great service, and food has always been consistent. Plus they're open late so you can get good midnight tacos when you need them.</review>

Changed it from a 3 to a 2. I was here recently and the lights are out on the outside, the menu isn't well lit and today I pull up and their "system is down" for unforeseen time. 10min? My death?

I didn't like it then and it appears to have not improved.  Order was wrong, several items.  Food was edible but not tasty.  Ordered the 8 layer burrito with Beyond Meat, got a Beef and Cheese Burrito.

It seems like a popular location, maybe the other customers don't mind multiple mistakes, and just like the food.

Recommendation: Stop the complicated naming. Stick to Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla, etc...</text>< Pictures>

Went to Del Taco after we were rudely turned away at Baja Fresh. (Woman decided not to serve a 12 year old girl 20 minutes before closing bc she was too lazy) Food was good. Window guy was...overly "happy" I think to cover up his irritation with being at work. I get it. Work sucks. Best thing tho...they got my order of 12 different items RIGHT. So big kudos for that.<//text>

I'm not enamored of fast food places in general, but I do like this Del Taco. Their food is fresh, made with minimal processing, and served with a smile. I am almost always greeted with willingness to accommodate special requests - with a smile. The pricing is reasonable, and their salads are usually pretty good.<//text>

This Del Taco however was very clean, quick with taking people's orders, and quick t ok get your food.

I like Del Taco in general, but it is frustrating when quality differs between locations. Thankfully I can report, this location definitely did not disappoint.  The place was clean, the worker was very friendly (and since it was late and thus not crowded, even brought our orders over to the table), and most importantly the food was PERFECT.  Now how often can you say that when going to a fast food restaurant?!

Unfortunately for us this location is about a half hour even when the traffic is good.  But nonetheless, I have to say our first visit was excellent.  And whenever we find ourselves in the Roseville area again, we'll be sure to make it the first of many!<//review>

<Text>It took 26 minutes for us to lose patience and ask them when our food would be ready. The guy was real apologetic... but still said there was another order before ours... the manager walked by with nasty look on her face as she kicked a crumpled bag out of her way long with the other garbage on the floor... we asked for our money back.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Rating>

Overall the food is ok. The service has gotten better, but don't expect anything from them on Taco Tuesday- they really skimp on the ingredients, which shouldn't be just because it's a value day.</Text>

I went through the drive thru for a late lunch and it was a surprisingly long wait time. Unusual for this location. But the employees were friendly and the food was fresh!</Text>

<text>Some days are better than others but today they really loaded my bean and cheese burrito (highlight of my Day :D) Didn't have to wait to long today either. Place is clean inside and employees seems nice. As always the best prices for fast food and good quality taste.< /text>< pics>

Food is usually made with care here. Occasionally a limp salad. Their food looks and tastes fresher than at their competitor. Lets be honest, this isn't really Mexican food, but for what it is - drive thru, healthier choices available, reasonably priced menu - is good.< /Text>

Today was first time I've been here in a few months. Was really surprised the service was great , the food correct and the fries or extra crispy just like I asked for! They get 5 stars for the service in the new revamped menu.</Review>

For a quick, inexpensive bite, it's good.  For my taste, I like it 100% better than it's main competition. Absolutely love the strawberry lemonade.< /Text>

Worst fast food experience to date...last customer inside maybe the reason but there is no excuse for the massive amou t of food and trash in the floor in the kitchen area...for some reason we still ordered...first 3 things we asked about they didnt want to cook because it was to close to close but we could order the couple things sitting cold on the stove...i ordered a asada burrito and got a chilli and potato wedge burrito that tasted like the kitchen looked.... We ordered $30 worth of food between 3 people...no body got thru their first item...and the rest we threw away at Carl's Jr..across the parking lot.....wish my hadn't been dead or the pics would be all over ...first del taco experience will probably be my last...and I was so excited to try it!!!<//Review>

<name>Jenny P.</name><Review>Friendly workers, good food, and rarely mess up on the orders (but be sure to check your bags before you leave, just in case). ;) The only downfall for me is that they don't have a lot of "Pescatarian (a person who does not eat meat, but does eat fish)" options...the fish tacos. That's my go-to. haha Anyway, it's good!<//Review><userid>107859048398589550040</userid></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
It was chicken taco night and it took 35 min. To get 2 tacos and a burrito and the manager was apologizing to everybody and offering people free coke or fries or whatever but when he got to me he called my number and walked away without any apology. So I will never go there again.<//Review>

<review>There lucky to get 1 star from me. I drove down the street to Carl's Jrs, after seeing this place had an outside bathroom with a payment for coins to use it??? What kind of place is this, that charges you to use the restroom?? All I wanted was to wash my hands before I ate there.<//review>< Time>

< Review>
Slowest drive thru in Roseville. They often forget to ask me If I need sauce and the food has come out cold on numerous ocassions. I like my quesadillas to be hot and fresh. Don't think I'll be stopping at this location anytime soon until they speed up the drive thru time, I can't wait 20 minutes for 3 quesadillas.<//Review>

I like my quesadillas to be hot and fresh. Don't think I'll be stopping at this location anytime soon until they speed up the drive thru time, I can't wait 20 minutes for 3 quesadillas.< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>I visited several months ago and had several health code concerns that I contacted corporate about. Last week I went 1/2 hour out my way just to go there. Although one of my concerns looked as if it was addressed (bathroom had cigarette butts on the floor, torn up brilo pads, bloody napkins). The others looked the same (food prep area counter's and floors look like they haven't been cleaned in days, homeless people napping at outside table and pacing up & down sidewalk next to windows).  I will never eat there again and have told friends and family to stay away from that location</review></record>

I have no idea why some people have an issue with Del Taco. First it's not mexican food, so don't judge it as such. With that said, it's darn tasty.<//review>

Of the 3 cars in front of me, only the front 2 had orders. And another car pulled in behind me! So its not like they were completely dead & closed early.

That place is in bad shap . i had a steak meat burrito it was nasty . Too much cartilage in the meat chewy and white rice was over cooked sticky clump of rice  after the 3rd bit i throw it away.

<review>Ordered and then told at window they're out of shells for the burritos I ordered.  The burritos I ended up with lack filling. I had more tortillas than I did eggs, cheese and band bacon. The service lacked and my total time feo ordering to the bag reaching my hand, took them a total of 16min and 47 min</review>< pics>
