Went at 9:20am on Sunday, where it not only states it's open at 9 on the Verizon website, but also ON THE BUILDING that it opens at 9 on Sundays. An employee walks in at 9:30am, at this point I've been waiting ten minutes. I call the store, he states they've never opened at 9 and when I ask why it says on the side of the building he say he doesn't know. I already made a complaint to corporate as well, I wasted 45 minutes of my day driving out of my way to try to get my phone fixed because this store falsely advertises it's hours.</text>

Jonathan and Ivan were absolutely fantastic this evening. I have had quite the experience getting things working with our new service using the customer service lines so I wasn’t expecting anything to positive when I went inside the store. Immediately though I was greeted with smiles and a warm welcome and then when it was my turn both gentlemen stepped up to help. They went above and beyond with their service and I will not be calling or going anywhere else if I need any type of assistance. There was another employee there helping someone and I didn’t get his name but he was very patient and kind to the elderly woman he was working with too. Their manager should be very proud of his crew!<//Text>

<Text>This retailer was great!  The guys here worked on getting me the best deal, they really went out of their way to see I had an awesome experience. They set my new phone up, transferred the data to my new phone, applied the screen saver and did it with a smile. They explained what they were doing every step of the way and how much it was going to cost. I will go here again when I want a new device or help with my phone.<//Text>< Rate>

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE - They tried to scam me, they kept pushing me towards phones and plans that were too expensive and more than I needed. I questioned them over an over as to why I had to buy an expensive phone I didn't need and a plan that was more than I wanted and they kept saying those were the only options. Finally I left and went to the Verizon in Citrus Plaza and they had several phones that worked for me and a plan that fit my budget. I knew that these Victra people were no telling me everything, don't trust them.</Review>

Xavier was great. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. I felt comfortable with my purchase as he had an answer for every question I asked him. Even though I was indecisive and I couldn’t make up my mind he didn’t seem to mind going over my options multiple times. He took his time and explained everything. Xavier even stayed after closing to complete my transaction. Thanks for the great service.<//Text>

<Review>My phone was stolen tonight, I panicked. I called the Verizon store at 7 pm.... they close at 8. I said do I have time to come down there right now? They said, come on over we're here to take care of you. I got there at 7:15pm..... was out by 8:15... the whole process after I decided on the phone I wanted took 10 short minutes. Kyle was 👏amazing! His guest service was top notch. I went from tears and not having a phone, to writing this review on my brand new radical phone. Thank you so much, you made my night!<//Review>< Pictures>

Bernard was more than helpful and went out of his way to get me the best deal possible on new equipment. He fixed the problem with my current phone as well which was the reason I went to the Verizon store to begin with. Kudos to the entire staff as they all made my experience a timely, pleasant and lucrative one!<//review>

Xavier was amazing! He did an outstanding job helping me understand all aspects of buying my new phone.  He should be considered a role model within his workplace along with the two other amazing gentlemen that also assisted with my purchase.  In all my years as a Verizon customer, this store and their awesome staff - in my opinion- is a leading example of quality, effective, and efficient service.<//Text>

< Review>
My phone was malfunctioning, and I missed an important call for a job I've been waiting for. I showed up to verizon on redlands blvd right as the store was closing, kind of stressed out about getting my phone charged somehow or exchanged fast. Xavier unlocked the door and saved the day. I'll be replacing my phone soon, but Xavier sold me a wireless charger that will get me by until that happens. I appreciate the fact that he cared. I survive solely on reviews and good customer service at my job in the auto business, and I hope this review helps Xavier in some way. He's the right guy for the job.< /Review>

<Text>This place so blatantly just charges a good chunk of money right on the top of what the price should be for example I was finalizing the sale on a phone on Verizon's application in their shop and I stopped right at the end just to check elsewhere before I completely finished the transaction and in this store it is (without embarrassment) $20 more monthly... It would be one thing if they had good service but they don't even have that<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Was completely lied to by the employee, Sergio, working that day.  When upgrading my phone,  I was pushed into taking home a Samsung galaxy notepad A.  Sergio reassured me several times it was free.  I explained to the man I can not afford anything more being add to my bill.  Sergio went so far as to show me next months bill with zero next to the notepad.  He even said it’s a special for customers who have been with the company over 6 years.   I had full confidence in what he was telling me so I took it home.  I finally receive my bill 14 days later and it shows an extra $86 dollars due to this notepad.  I am now told I have to wait three to two months and be refunded later for it.  They also told me if I return it now I will be charged double.  I was completely manipulated and scammed by this facility and I will make sure no one from my family or friends buy anything from this store.  Honestly I would give zero stars.< /text>

Sandy was amazing! The best Verizon service ever! I’ve been a Verizon customer for ever and this is the first time I’ve completed a phone upgrade in the store so quickly and efficiently! We showed up at 7:40pm thinking the store closed at 9:00pm, but they closed at 8:00pm. Sandy did our whole transaction with 2 phones and stayed until we were done! Best customer service ever! Thank you for finally hiring someone who really cares about her job and her customers. Reminds me of the good ole days!</Text>

Came in looking for a better upgrade on my phone, Sergio gave me all the answers I needed up front and explained all the fees ect so there where no surprises. He was extremely helpful and was very accommodating to what I wanted. He ordered my phone for me, I came and got it a few days later and he helped me get it activated. Best service I’ve ever had at Verizon hands down!< /text>

< Review>
Total scam, I do not wish for anyone to be in the same situation. Johnny gave me a very nice face and I left their store very happy and wrote them a good review upon their request, however later I realized that he took advantage of me and he set me up for recurring monthly payment with what is called smart pay, which is a company that leases phone accessaries and when i tried to confront him he said he can do anything and that I need to contact their business office" which was basically a version customer number". Every time i purchase a phone from version store I buy accessaries from the store itself despite knowing its expensive but i like the quality of version products, however that was the first time that i get not to know about the prices for the accessaries since he repeatedly kept saying that he will take care of me, also he asked me to pick 2 items for free and i did take a wire charger and a portable charger. All what I knew later that I signed for smart pay for 6 items and that the iPad screen protector cost me 120$ and the 2 free items cost 39.99 and 44.99 .... I called version and complained and they contacted the store manager who promised to respond to me in a week time and he didn't. Terrible experience in a great family city like Redlands. Never again and always should follow and trust people's reviews and their's sucks.

The first 24 hours were some of the worst in my life, with multiple obstacles including previous numbers not porting over, SIMs not working, phones staying locked, security pins not registering, lots of wrong info being told to me, and having no phone for the day! However, the rep at this Verizon fixed it all, and saved the day. She went above and beyond to ensure every issue was solved. Thank you so much. Let’s see how the next 24 hours goes!</review>< user>

This place is garbage they charge you for everything. Go the location off lugonia where the service is free. And you will be told up front fees or fees that maybe billed. This place will not tell you and charge for things that corporate said they shouldn't have charged.<//review>

<review>I was so impressed with the service, and especially professional demeanor of Jonathan V, the sales person helping me today. We had difficulty getting Equifax to fix the computer "glitch" that kept us there for hours, but Jonathan persisted throughout. I was definitely impressed with his patience. In fact, the entire store atmosphere was noticeably calmer and more enjoyable than their competitor, whom I'd been using for several years, but recently gave up trying to get them to fix their mistakes. Jonathan V and the staff at Verizon Victra, Redlands Orange, earned an A+ from me today.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Very positive experience at the Verizon store in Redlands. Both staff I worked with were very patient and Incredibly helpful. Very thorough and no pressure suggestions on phones. They worked really hard to find the best price using available promotions. All data transferred from old phone and the new one is ready to go!
The only suggestion is they need more staff. While we were being helped by the only employee at that time, multiple customers came in waited, and then ended up leaving as no one was available to help them. Management needs to work on their Staffing levels as that is the face of the business.</Review>< time>

My wife and I were both taken care of and Sandy took her time to explain the differences between the 3 phones we were looking into. All of our information from the old phones were transfered onto the new and we're very happy about that. Best of all there was no huge line!

The representative that assisted my wife and I in getting new phones was informative, helpful, and very very sweet. Working with Amy was a pleasure to work with, She went above and beyond in assisting us with retrieving all of my wife's information off of her phone, and we will definitely continue to return for all future visits to this store and ask for her. 100/10 customer service!</review>

Dealt with  Daniel who was outstanding and Sean the branch management individuals were very conscious of seeing that I was satisfied yet at the same time aware of offers available. Was not aware of deals available and since the offers were free in some case they did not have to inform me about them. One of the better shipping experiences I have had.<//Review>

I wished I saw these reviews before going into this store. Amy helped us out told me and my husband that we wouldn't get charged for adding his phone number to our line. We did an early upgrade on my phone and had to return my phone via mail. THEY FORGOT MY SHIPPING LABEL AND BOX.  We had to return to the store to get it. Then we find out that our bill which should of been $200 was now doubled because Amy offered 2 hum devices for "free".  I got a notification from Verizon saying we were being charged. I just got off the phone with this location and the woman on the phone said we signed a contract saying that we wanted the service w/o promotion.  We wouldn't even got the Hum if it wasn't free. On top of that they have THE WORST customer service by not fulfilling what was promised and just unpleasant attitudes. I called corporate and basically since this is a 3rd party they can run any "promotions" they want and Verizon can't do anything about it. We're going into this store tomorrow for the 3rd time and if they correct this issue then I will make an update to this post. But as of now I would say 0 stars from me. Just go to the Verizon in Citrus Plaza. I never had a problem there and I've been going there for 8 years. The only reason why I went here is because I called the wrong store and thought they were all the same so decided to give it a shot. DON"T MAKE MY MISTAKE!</review>

< Review>
Worst sales experience I've had in 20 years. Sales people were rude,disrespectful and untruthful.
We would have left but they had our old phone and had already transferred the data to our new one.
At the time of purchase, I told them we were dissatisfied with their service and the attitude we got back was that was our problem.

They tried to push a "HUM" unit on us--we told them NO--and then when we got our first bill--we were charged for it. --even though we never took it.
We went back to have the charge removed--and they wanted to charge us for a disconnect fee --$100!  This is just one example of our experience--many more examples could be given.

Never go to this store!  You will regret it.
If there was a way to plaster our experience on a sign over their entrance I would.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give a negative rating I would, worst Customer service I have ever experienced with any company.  They were nice and helpful while purchasing the product and services, but try and return or cancel services and they do everything they can to keep from dealing with the customer.  excuses like managers not in or manager is in a meeting, can you come back and then he still isn't in.  I finally had to call my credit card company to dispute the charges, still waiting for a 200.00 refund.  update 7\18\2016 and they did finally take the devices off my account, but no refunds for the merchandise or devices, very disappointing....
7/22/2016 - Jason contacted me and a refund was issued, didn't like the issues between him and his employees, but Jason did finally resolve some of the issues.
9/20/2016 - I give them a -5 stars, its been 2 months and they are still billing me for items I turned in in beginning of July, The absolute worst company I have ever done business with. I am going to pay the bill, because money isn't the issue.   I will never do business with this company ever again.
6/9/2017 -6/9/2017 - I had to call a collection agency for past due notice of $200.00 for cancelling a jet pack I received from Verizon but never used. I turned it in the device without ever using it, but they insisted that I still needed to pay a cancellation fee of $200.00.  Not once did Verizon or A Wireless ever bothered to contact me letting me know of this bill.  Not until it hit my credit report did I even know I had a bill, so I called the collection agency and paid it.  I asked for a copy of the bill and they said they didn’t have a copy of it.  I am so appalled and disappointed in the manner in which A Wireless does business.  I just want everyone to know the kind of business this is, you can form your own opinion, I am just providing the facts so at least you know what you can expect if you choose to do business with them.  I plan on letting my cousin, The Retail Sales Director at Verizon Wireless, just what type of business is being conducted at A Wireless. Looking forward to my family reunion in August 2017.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The employees here are very nice and seem helpful when you're interested in making a purchase! However after spending about 5+ hrs at the store one day getting everything worked out to get new phones, we received our latest bill and had hundreds of dollars of extra charges we were not informed of! Be aware they are not disclosing the actual amounts you will end up paying in hidden fees!!! Hours were spent in store, on the phone trying to figure out the bill, more time in the store to fix the bill, and very little attention (especially from management) when it came to fixing their mistakes. It was very deceiving and confusing to go through this process!!! I would not recommend wasting your time going into this store to get new phones--figure out another way to do it!</Text>

She took on all of our questions one by one & satisfied us with answers we needed.  Not only that, but as she looked into our account, Tali told us about Verizon promotions for unlimited datad and buy 1get 1 free new Pixel 3 phones.

After Tali's help and working knowledge of all the Verizon products, we highly recommend her and the very helpful, approachable staff at this Verizon store.

Tali, thank you for exceeding our expectations! We appreciate & thank you very much!<//review></record>

<Text>A phone we turned in for a credit was lost by the store, so there was a big charge put on my bill. We have communicated with 4 different managers (very high turn around) and still nothing resolved on this issue. We have called several times a week for over a month with the constant same answer.. “we are trying to figure it out”. This store is not being very helpful at all! We keep being blown off about the issue. It’s time to start filing complaints with Verizon itself. I have never left a review on anything before, but this matter has defenitly warranted this very bad review!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, repeatedly!

Regardless of how many times we asked, and how many ways we asked, and how clearly we asked, and how many different people we asked, we were repeatedly told that the "misunderstandings" were going to be taken care of.  We were repeatedly blown off.  At NO POINT did anyone follow through on the actions that they said they would do.  We paid for accessories we said we didn't want AND  we were misinformed about what our bill was going to cost each month AND we were given wrong information about the "Switch" promotion, and I wasn't told that our phones weren't to be used as hot spots until after we'd signed on the dotted line.

Q1 - How much do we need to spend...tonight?
A1 - $140
Actually we paid $248

Q2 - How much is our monthly bill going to be?
A2 - $220-$230 depending on taxes.
Actually our first two months added up to $744.

Q3 - Are there ANY..A N Y...other fees.
A3 - Yes there's there's a small set up fee.

Q4 - But you waived those set up fees?
A4 - There are additional set up fees.

Q5 - So what do we do with our other phones?
A5 - You will receive a text with instructions on how to return those phones so that we can pay off the remaining balance.
Actually...no such text exists.  They were supposed to have us turn in our phones in person, to them.  Now...a month later, we have a $1200 T-Mobile bill for the phone that Verizon said that they'd pay off...AND we have a $744 Verizon bill.

After spending just over 75 minutes on the phone with Verizon Customer Support...trying to figure out how to get our old phones "switched" out, the Verizon Customer Service Agent shared how incredibly often she hears these exact same tactics used by many of the Verizon sales people.

MY MIND IS BLOWN with the lack of ethics of this company, as well as the lack of concern by it's employees.</Text>< Time>

<review>At the beginning of October 2016, I went into this Verizon location to buy a new cell phone. I opted for an iPhone SE and they sold it to me in a bundle with a screen protector and case. All of my new phone equipment would be covered under warranty with Verizon and I could take it into any store. Awesome! They were also doing a special that weekend for Tablets and said I could buy a new tablet for $20 flat because I was buying a new phone at the same time. I asked if there would be any additional or monthly fees with it or any changes to my current plan. No. Great. I'll take one then. Finished my transaction and left the store. No issues.

Fast forward to the beginning of December: turns out, getting a tablet opened up a new 2-yr line on my bill that I'm being billed for monthly, plus the smart device monthly fee. To close the line, I have to pay over $300. Fine. I'll take the L since I should have reviewed everything before I left the store in the first place. Asked about the bundle package that I got and was told that everything is what I was told and I'm covered completely.

Here we are December 15th and I broke the screen. I went into a closer Verizon location and was told that the screen is NOT covered under warrant and I would need to buy a new one. I called the location I bought it from and the manager says that the woman who sold it to me should not have said that because it's not covered. I also mention he tablet issue and ask if that's normal and he says that they should have told me it would open a new lie and d he's sorry they didn't.

Scam alert! I went in a few days ago and a woman named Amy assisted me. She was extremely sweet but I had a gut feeling she was not being honest with me. I got out of there as soon as possible! I double checked the Verizon website and she was trying to charge me $199 for an upgrade fee and on the website the fee was only $30! She blatantly lied to me when I specifically asked how much the fee would be online. Then she went and talked to her manager and they lowered the fee to $150! Not to mention the price for my phone was cheaper on the verizon website. Super high pressure and lies.<//Text>

<text>If I could give a store a negative score,
I would, these guys deserve it. Possibly the worst customer service I have had in my life. Highly recommend not going to this store. Their manager, Luis Venegas is the worst of the lot, don't even know how he ended up as a manager there. You would be better off going the store across the street. Don't relay on anything these sales rep say, they are just after your money.<//text>< user>

Was lied to to upgrade my plan, Tony told me the cost would be  extra $40 a month just got my bill notification (while I am on vacation hours away from any verizon retailer) which is an extra $168 per month, still waiting for Tony to call us back corporate told me I can return my phone and cancel this within the next 2 days, better bet I will find my way across the island to cancel this and the tv /Internet we set up with them as well if we do not hear back from Tony by tomorrow AM.  I will change my review if they come through on their promises. Otherwise I will find a way to cancel.<//review>

<Text>This store consistently uses deceptive practices and breaks all the rules to their financial advantage, and customer's disadvantage. For example: I was lied to, when told no problem on a return and that it would be corrected and credited. I am still being charged a month later on a device I returned the very next day after purchase.  This same location approved a phone upgrade(new 2 year term) to my account by a non-authorized person without even contacting me.< /Text>< resp>

I always try and see the positive side of every shopping experience, however, in this case that is impossible--I purchased an iPad mini for $400.00 and was told it was a retina display and that it was refurbished model.  I came home and looked up the serial number on the Apple website, it was not a retina display and it was a 2012.  I had done some research on the cost of this tablet and of course thought the price was good.  I was so wrong, went back to the store for an exchange and of course they didn't have a retina display and had to order it.  I waited over a week and then went to pick it up, I was charged $129.00 more for this model.  I could have purchased one at the Lugonia store for $439.00.  I would not recommend buying anything from this store.<//Text>

I had a miserable experience at this store . I won't drag this out but was given a free screen protector with my IPhone 5 for all the bs I was put through over a 5 day period . Turns out it was a piece of clear cellophane stuck to the front of the phone! Came off. Had proper shield applied at Costco. Customer service stunk. People here are stupid and not properly trained. I had to activate phone myself as no one could get it done at this joke of a store!< /Review>

<review>I gave this a one star Becuz with the buy back program I just kept getting Miss lead info and I didn't know that I was suppose to return my old phone and turn into them on the first day I got it but instead I'm told you gotta have your last bill, so I did I waited it my last bill and they started the process on there computer and I thought my last sprint bill would be paid but no I get a email saying it was invalid and my 45 days for the buy back was almost up when I was never told that! And the woman working there looks at me and say oh u didn't get a box? Uhhhhh no Becuz u never told me anything about that! And they also said that my phone would still be bought even though it wouldn't turn on but the outside looks good! Worst customer service and miss lead info from any company! Now I'm stuck with a $600 sprint bill that I gotta pay! Get rid of who ever is working there and get people who know what there doing and talking about!</review>< GmapID>

I really enjoyed the M+M summer program in 2019. It was my first time in USA and I found all my colleagues very friendly and the program very useful. I'm proud to be part of SCI_Arc Alumni.< /Text>

<Review>The School that Changed a City

I write this review not as an alumni but as an Angeleno.

When the Sci-arc moved to its current location from Marina del Rey in 2000 the surrounding neighborhood was empty, desolate, and filled with crime and homeless.  People say there are three things that fuel a thriving community: housing, dining, and schools.  It has been almost over a decade since housing and restaurants slowly and carefully moved in, but it wasn't until Sci-arc finally purchased the build that it rented for so many years.

That catapulted the community into the fast lane.  Housing sky rocked, hip restaurants and boutique stores moved in, mega complexes started to get built.  It's a milestone that changed the entire eastside of Los Angeles.

Architects Home Grown

The connective tissue between Sci-arc and downtown Los Angeles is undeniable and beneficial to both parties.  Students and faculty architects are deeply engrained in the current rising of Downtown Los Angeles.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPwp7CXzwFYv_642t5KZg0ARPDcyJwtxL7gynO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzL5QD3jYFb7QVHWavvStn4IjvuUsf5sKF-5sI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqbpxbL0sKRTYyyQIVjV5SbdUtUmIGua1e4gjx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Basically sci-arc is a scam especially their edge-program. They shouldn’t open stuff like fiction and entertainment, as far as I most student goes bankrupt after enrolling that program! Imagining a film school teaching architecture design then congratulations you will never able to compete with the real architect. Anyway, they only benefit for their selves, for example my professor do scam and make more than 150K per year, so he bought a houses in LA in just 2 years. Do go there, you will be put into a trap and it takes you few years or you never strong enough to go out from the trap.</text>

The school that is proud of their high number international students!
I don’t know about others, I was clearly misled by chair of admission who told me I will be hired to work on a project that the institute has won, located in South of Paris. He explained how lucky I would be to be able to work while I study as other students had to look for work after graduation. It was a lie. After I arrived I had to ask about the project multiple times, and eventually I was told it has been a miscommunication. A miscommunication! No projects. So it was only a small lie to get me on board. The lies still continue in every occasion. I’d say this school is highly unethical in many ways. Also, you will use broken chairs and desks made of cheap materials. Stay away.<//text>

<text>The postgraduate program (the scam called EDGE which only offers OPT and no other value) chair calls himself “the most brilliant architect alive” in his self written articles, he has never done any architecture, he cannot even draw a line, he has a bachelors degree in philosophy and a 1 year masters degree in architecture. He is the main instructor who basically “talks” without any relevance to the subject. This type of person can only exist in a low quality pricy school like sciarc. Even worse, he is focused on his assistant. All above happening in sciarc. Fancy to join?< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Fitting to see they can't seem to crack the lists of top architecture schools, trophies just for placing I guess, although one of the highest tuition costs in the country doesn't seem justified if the prestige isn't really all that great with hiring firms. Not as advertised in my opinion (though they do seem to self-advertise heavily), it is a good old boys club as far as I am concerned, intelligence takes a backseat and only a handful of students who play that game will really thrive from a system like that.
They seem to take whoever they can get, with a very high acceptance rate for an "elite" school. In my own experience making the mistake of attending the MArch2 program for two semesters, the literacy rates were dreadful, "easiest A you'll ever get" I had heard a few times in conversation when I mentioned that it bothered me some of my graduate peers struggled to read English at a supposedly elite educational institution in the United States.
For how "competitive" they lauded the student body to be when I voiced complaint, in my architectural theory classes most of the students could hardly read written English, much less participate their words in any meaningful discussion with professors who struck me as the incredibly elitist type that could care less who they're teaching. After all it's not like they will remember many of the student livestock, mostly mislead into coming from overseas, once they've paid for the last semester of extremely over-priced tuition.
It's also worth mentioning that the studio instructors browbeat students into spending what I always considered a second tuition cost on supplies, pedestals, expensive 3d-prints due most classes, and in render-farm credits necessary to finish animated assignments. The burden of most of those payments is thrown damn near entirely on the student. Just in case I haven't supplied enough of a warning, have fun with your sorry excuse for a workspace. That's right, each student was given what was called a desk made out of a few trash pieces of plywood or particle board that must be some sort of minimalist inside-joke between the faculty.
Maybe with the previous dean it was a better situation, but Hernan has not been very impressive. But again that's just my opinion, perhaps if they were more transparent concerning graduate job placement statistics, or lack thereof...

<text>It is an expensive school for “no good reason”. They are desperate to bring students on board and offer full scholarships to more than half of their students. The other half are from rich Chinese families whom cannot even speak proper English.
Their degree is useless in any occasions later in your academic or professional life. They do not get you prepared for the real world as the faculty is clueless, because they have never performed in the real world and have done nothing other than “”””””talking””””””. They bs a lot to prove they know and are completely insecure of being compared with professionals.
You will leave this school empty handed, the avant-garde approach which raises the question “can it even be built?” and will be lucky to find a job as a “software operator” for an architecture company the best and start over learning from there.< /text>< user_name>

<text>Right this minute I am sitting at a picnic table next to my Weber grill with my sweetie.
It's the end of a great day in Joshua Tree National Park.
I hear laughter from the neighboring campsite. I see the glow of campfires all around me.
Power, water, sewer. Lots of space. Great hosts. What's not to love.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Nice respite from the road, lots of space between sites, easy to get to location, clean campground. Only down fall, don't expect the wifi to work, its super slow and goes in and out. If you need to do any work while out on the road, don't depend on it.</Review>

Joshua Tree Gem Spring show offered a variety of rock slabs, cabochons, jewelry and family fun.  There's another one in October.  The wildflowers in full bloom were a bonus!</text>

This place was perfect for my family to RV camp. They had everything we needed from fire rings and picnic tables. Hosts are super friendly!
Also - only 5 minutes from the Park entrance<//Text>

<review>The lady that used to run the place was kind but never told us what day we are supposed to pay the rent for the 1 month we were there for. We planned on staying another month. I have proof on my csmp card they gave me..no date. But I got a knock at the door said we had to leave because they were no longer going to be an open campground! We did nothing wrong. I said I was trying to contact the camp host but she never came out or answered her phone to pay her. I said I would pay him immediately but he said no. He then lied and said they were shutting down. I was waiting for my home to be built and this guy was the rudest person I have ever met. I would never ever tell anyone to stay there. Also the septic was crawing with cockroaches! Every time I opened the valve to open the tank they would crawl in. So gross. I have a brand new 41 ft 5th wheel and have never had that happen before. To the owner.....shame on you.<//review>< Pictures>

Sweet and simple plots with everything we needed (picnic table, fire pits, bathrooms with hot showers, wifi and all the hookups). We had family stay here in their RV as well.
It's the perfect place because it is close to everything - including downtown Joshua Tree and the Park. Highly recommend!</Review>

The sportsman's club is great there's trivia night on Wednesday night's at 8pm and there I a R/V and camp brands the campgrounds have everything you need showers and a place to wash your clothes. And the camp Host is the best I would have to say amazing she make it feel like home away from home. I will stay here every time I come to Joshua Tree.</review>

Very close to Joshua Tree NP! Basic, no frills camping.

Camped in a 35” motorhome. We are self-contained so cannot comment on restrooms/shower facilities.
Pros –
-	Convenient to Joshua Tree Nat’l Park.
-	Very nice park host.
-	Adjacent to a park with courts and walking/jogging trails.

Cons –
-	Tough to make reservations or talk to someone about the park.
-	Sand, sand, sand<//text>

Totally unexpected so we had to share this review. The service and the price was brilliant. The simplicity is just what we were looking for and we appreciated the amazing service from Brenda. All hook ups provided and free wifi. We would highly recommend to short term travellers.</review>

I went to help an elderly man set up for the gem & mineral show the weekend in April and I'm not sure of the man's name that owns it but he was very nice and accommodating to our needs. We were unaware that we were to provide our own tables which he provided in addition to allowing us to enter and leave the rear entrance as it was much easier due to wheelchair neccesitties. All questions were politely answered and the show was amazing! Thank you!< /text>

<text>This is a diamond in the rough.  We met family in Joshua Tree and tried Sportsman's Lodge, the RV park is fairly large but there was only 3 rigs staying there, including us.  They have just renovated the bar and serve craft beer on tap and had burgers which were great.  The park is clean and quiet and very close to Joshua Tree National Park, which our RV is too large to get into, so this place was perfect, we'll be back!!</text></record></dataset><record>

The only thing I would ever order there was always a Torta. In my opinion this place has the very best Tortas in the world, I always got Carne Asada or Jamon y Quesco. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'm going to stop by and pick up like 4 or 5 of them.<//text>< userid>

<review>My favorite meat from there is the carne asada. Only place I get get carne asada tacos, burritos, etc. Their other choices of meat that they offer are okay. Small restaurant for small groups of people. I give it a 4 cause of their carne asada lol< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
I went there to get gas and the lady said my card was declined, I tried  3 times and all 3 were declined but immediately after pulling put of there I get an online alert that my card was charged for the amount that I was declined in the store.  The cashier was as nice as she could be but there was a language barrier, my Spanish is  very very limited and her English was just as limited as my Spanish.....I tried calling several times but i got no answer.   Really hope the store can resolve this.
They credited the money back very fast!! Thank u so much. .....changed my 1 star to 5!!! Thank u again</Review>

<Text>Cheap gas for premium and I paid with my card my debit card and they gave me a discount which I thought they only did for cash so pretty cool. Gas was with the discount $2.91 for premium pretty good price for the area. Big smile 🙂😁🙆😷 StayWell 6ft can change your whole life 🙏< /Text>< pics>

Go here all the time. Cheapest gas around for miles. Staff are pretty much non-existent, non-english speaking but it's still the best place to get gas.</Review>

This gas station has everything you need: Gas of course, snacks, drinks, and you can even buy lottery tickets. It's situated on a busy intersection, in a good area. If you need to get gas, come to G & M.</text>

I only had a large bill for the purchase and the lady lied and said she didn't have enough change, then I said why your supposed to have enough change for your customers and said ok I don't want your business and I am leaving and then she changed her mind and after the transaction I told her I didn't like the fact that she lied to my face I'm a paying customer, she must be losing this company tons of income.<//Text>

< review>
I often come to this location to pump gas and enjoy that this is probably the cheapest station in the area I work in. Though I am satisfied on most days, I have come to this location about 4 or 5 times between 1:30am - 3:30 am and have found no one on shift and the door locked. I am aware that this station is 24 hours because I've pumped here in the early mornings before. On 2/16/16 at 2:21am was the same story, so I decided to see how long it would take for someone to answer the door; assuming they were in the back. I knocked for about 15 minutes and even honked my car horn and no one responded. I finally gave up and drove off.</review>

Easy in and out. Also they don't charge u a fee to use  your debate card like Arco gas station. If u use your debit card for gas they give u cash price  for gas..<//review>

The staff are friendly whenever we go in to buy something. The gas is also cheaper compared to all other gas stations closeby.

Gratitude Attracts Blessings - Sam< /user_name>

Beautiful community church with a diverse parish. They are hiding the Arc of the Covenant in their chappel.
Fr. Mark Martinez is the new associate pastor who came from Saint Monica's Catholic Church in Santa Monica. His homilies are very relatable and applicable to every day life.
Come be grateful for the many blessings that God has given us. The more we live in gratitude, the more we are blessed with greater blessings to be grateful for.</text>

We have attended this beautiful Church for over 30 years. Everyone is welcomed and made to feel like family. Father Richard Vega and all the Priests do an amazing job sharing the word of God. We drive from Rancho Cucamonga to attend Mass.

<text>(Translated by Google) I have great respect and love for my parish ... wonderful place of prayer and blessings. I have never seen a place where the parishioner will be taken with so much care and dedication. In this temple I have seen the wonders of God, and I have learned a lot from my faith. I deeply appreciate! to all who work so that we have experience of God through his teachings. May God continue to bless us all.

Tengo un gran respeto y cariño Por mi parroquia...maravilloso lugar de oración y bendiciones. Nunca había visto un lugar donde se tomará con tanto cuidado y dedicación al feligrés. En este templo he visto las maravillas de Dios, y he aprendido mucho de mi fe. Agradezco profundamente! a todos los que trabajan para que tengamos experiencia de Dios través de sus enseñanzas. Que Dios nos siga bendiciendo a todos.<//text><pics>None< /pics><user_id>102143635493233592615< /user_id></record>

This Shell station has a very friendly shop. You might encounter people who need a few free gallons of gas to make it out of the city. Not sure if they were planning a weekend getaway, but it's always nice to help out. I'm glad I did.</Text>

Rude customer service!!!! I live and work here in P.A. I also pump gas here every time. This weekend just stopped on our way back from camping to pump gas. My mother is a little ill and when she needs to go to the restroom she has to go! Never have we used those restrooms since we live so close.  My mother asked for the key and he gave her such a hard time and accused her by saying "you guys always want to use the restroom without buying or pumping gas!!!"
WOW!!!! I couldn't believe it!! I went in and confronted him. When he had realized he was wrong and had just stereotyped my mother. He went on saying "you looked at me ugly and you guys think you are all that!!!! Don't know exactly what he meant by that. He made SUCH A BIG DEAL,  HE EVEN CALLED THE POLICE!!!! Of course they got there and saw how ignorant he sounded. Not a single word was told to me by the cops. I left without any problems.

Don't know why he insist in stereotyping people!!! He obviously has a problem!!! Just be careful out there with this rude problematic man. At one point I thought he was going to get physical. Since he went on insulting me and using profanity words didn't care that my daughters were present!</Text>

<review>I'm a fan. Minsters always 2 for $4 and they have body armor water. I wish they had more pumps because it's busy busy but I always come here for gas and an occasional monster.  Lady and guy are really nice to customers if they remember you even nicer.<//review>< Rate>

Your average Shell but unfortunately it's also in one of the worst locations. If you're trying to get back to 101 after getting fuel, you should just give up if your trying to cross Embarcadero directly. Instead you should try to go into the market area where Sbux is so you can get to the light to safely get back onto Embarcadero. They need to figure something out because this is the closest gas station for many in a few miles.<//review>

<review>There should be negative stars for rating, because that's how the service in this gas station is--very negative and terrorizing.  I witnessed the Shell gas employee (a brown-skinned grey-haired man, about 5 feet tall) threatened to shoot his customers for wanting to have a clean soapy water  to clean their windshield after buying premium gas for their car!  I will never come back here.  You don't threaten to shoot people for that, or for any reason!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1620535822460</Date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Alex K was honest about his arrival window and sounded trustworthy over the phone, disclosed important information about his service, especially the part that his lock was USPS approved. I had called the people from mailboxlockandkey.com whom at first seem professional but then lost my trust when they had gone over their arrival window and tech had been diverted to another emergency call-in and didn't bother to let me know. They also didn't give me a complete quote over the phone. HOWEVER, ALEX K straight up told me exactly how much I would pay($150) and how long it would take to change the lock and create keys to our mailbox. He said 15 minutes and actually took about 10 MINUTES!!!! NOW THAT'S SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE ARE DOING AND YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALEX K TO EVERYONE BECAUSE HE'S PROFESSIONAL AND TRUSTWORTHY.<//Review></record>

Dishonest, very expensive, unreasonable. Poor experience

This is for a simple repair to front door lock of a rental house I own. I googled and called Tony. Specially told him I am the owner and would pay for the service. He quoted me $39 for service call and repair cost typically ranges from $85 to $150. He asked me for cell # for him to text me to get the address. After receiving no text, I called him again and did get his text. Provided him address and the tenant contact and asked him to schedule. A few hours later, got a text message from the tenant informing me that he was forced to pay $409 otherwise the service man won't leave. The service man did try to call me but I was not available (did not know the schedule so no way to anticipate the call). The tenant said he did not get a quote before repair work started. So in short the repair cost was not approved. According to the tenant, the service man is local near the repair site and it did not take much time to fix the problem. I called Tony and questioned the charge/service without any approval. He offered nothing except to remove the lock and refund $150. He obviously took advantage of us. He should not be doing business like this. I strongly recommend not use this unprofessional man!< /review>

We installed a new hardware, fresh installation and rekeyed the lock, the tenant agreed, paid and signed.\nAfter the installation, the owner of the apartment wasn't happy with the price.\n\nWe offered to remove the new lock and only pay for the labor. But he disagreed.\nThe owner wanted to pay only $29 for the service call.

<Review>Wow! Amazing, reliable, fast, & very professional service.  He (Tony) came to repair my car‘s door lock key a day ago. He knows right away after telling him what’s wrong. He takes his time showing & explaining to me what are my (best) options. Very straightforward  and job well done. Appreciated for service.

<review>I called several locksmiths in the area and got a lot of excuses and up sales of why the could not do the job right away and what I needed to change. I called Tony from 1st pick Locksmith and he responded right away I sent him some pictures of the work I needed done and he was right at my door step in less than a half hour. He was prompt professional and never gave me the run around. I didn't have keys to certain looks and he was able to still change them out making everything on one key and worked very smoothly. He was quick and knew what he was doing. I highly recommend him for any Locksmith job weather it be commercial, residential or even auto he's your man very reasonably priced.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1573453704662, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the review.

<Text>Tony arrived quickly. Went to work immediately. He had my car unlocked in 5 min. Let me know my full coverage insurance would reimburse his services. Made sure I had a photo copy of my receipt to send to them. Offered to make a spare key for me on the spot. He’s polite and professional. Thank you Tony. I appreciate you. Highly recommend! 🙏🏻</Text>< pics>

Arrived quickly and unlocked the door for our restaurant bathroom! Also be sure to ask about the service fee because this is additional and not included in the fee quoted. We were quoted $45-75 and it ended up being $75 for a regular non commercial lock but then we were told it’s usually a $29 service fee in addition. Really good if you need immediate assistance though!</Text>

Very happy with my experience! Tony was professional, quick and efficient. I broke my key inside the ignition of my truck, and luckily I was able to get it out myself, with no problem. Being my only key, I needed a replacement, ASAP. It didn’t take Tony any longer than 15 min to get to me (I live locally, in Murrieta) and he immediately took care of the issue. Would definitely recommend to anyone in need of a good locksmith!</Review>

<review>After traveling over seas and trying to balance a heavy work schedule I realized the bag containing my car keys was missing. I called Tony at 1st Pick Locksmith Service and he took what usually would be a stressful situation and accommodated around my business hours immediately. I didn't have to tow my car anywhere and he provided what I learned to be the most affordable pricing in the industry without having to compare prices. If you're in need of a honest locksmith I highly recommend 1st Pick Locksmith Service!< /review>< GmapID>

We called a couple of locksmiths to help us with a cabinet we needed and fixed and they couldn’t help us. Tony was very friendly on the phone and arrived quickly. He was very professional and went out of his way to find special parts for us. No one else was willing to do that and we appreciated him going the extra mile. We will definitely use him again and recommend him to others!< /review>

I called Tony and he came to the house within 10 minutes. He replaced the lock and I was able to use the same key that matches the other doors in the house. The price was great for the service he provided. I’d recommend him to my friends and family.< /Text>

<Text>Excellent service and communication. Reasonable pricing and a steal compared to the dealership. He met me at my car on time and didn't miss a beat in the process. My car only came with one keyless entry fob and I needed a second one. These are the latest tech keys and many locksmiths will not be able to code it as you need access to Fords system to do it. This company has all the tech to do what is needed. Great job thanks.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Great, quick, convenient!  I called and the tech was at my house within minutes. I had a 91 Cadillac Sedan deVille, that the keys were lost to. It had sat up a couple years. The tech came out, got the codes and got the key made in a jiffy. Low cost and efficient. Very professional and helpful!  I will use this business for any future needs. He also made keys for my neighbor’s mailbox and cars.< /Review>

Tony was great! Someone stole my keys from the laundry mat and Tony helped get into my car and gave me a free second key as well. It was hard finding a locksmith at 10 pm to unlock a 2009 Hyundai Elantra I even called AAA and they said they couldn’t help me until Monday. I was upset and Tony was my last resort. Thank you so much!<//Review>

<Name>Jake Harman</Name><review>Tony was awesome to work with. My key broke at Pechanga Casino and I couldn’t get ANYONE to come out to make a new key for my 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer. Tony called me this morning with a price far cheaper than my dealer and the few locksmiths I was able to speak to. He was fast, courteous, and got me back on the road fast!<//review>< Pics>

I wish I could give Tony six stars.  He was here when he promised with all the materials we had asked him for.  After he made us four new keys, his calibration was no longer working to his liking.  We asked him to go ahead and make the other four keys when he could and return them to us.  He was back with the four additional keys in less than an hour.  And he still checked to see that each key works correctly!  His customer service is amazing.< /review>

They were so helpful and let me know I should check with my insurance and with my AAA roadside service. I found out having a new key made was covered by my roadside coverage, even though the car was parked at my home! 1st Pick Locksmith accepted the insurance coverage amount without a copayment. If I had used AAA’s locksmith it would have cost me an additional $75.00.< /Text>< pictures>

This is the locksmith to use. I tried calling 4 different locksmiths before I reach Tony from 1st Pick LockSmiths. Tony was fast getting to my home and cut a smart key to a push to start Nissan and a security key and it was all done for a GREAT PRICE!!!! 1st Pick Locksmiths does great work and stand by everything they say..Tony is the man you will not go wrong with using him. Great Work 1st Pick Locksmiths.< /Review>

<review>Tony was able to arrive within 15 minutes of calling him. I’ve been having issues with my car I had recently purchased, the dealer had given me the wrong emergency key for my driver door. Tony was able to cut me a spare key in the mean time, and also ordered new emergency keys to cut for my Mazda’s keyless remotes. Very great and quick service.</review><name>Francis Lopez<//name>< userid>

Awesome service!! Sadly my car was broken into today.  But, Tony is a life saver!!! He came out at 10pm on a Monday night to take care of my 2012 F150. He had to Cut, chip and reprogram a new set of keys on my truck. Very professional and clean work.

Thank you Tony for phenomenal work!< /review>

<review>1st pick locksmith came out the same day I needed them and went the extra mile in making 2 copies of my original key for my Ford Focus. My original key was damaged and he worked to find the original cut of the key so we could get it right at no additional cost.</review>< pics>

Elad was amazing! We needed our locks rekeyed and he said he would  arrive within an hour.   He arrived on time, rekeyed all our locks and made us new keys.  He was so professional and helpful.   We highly recommend 1st Pick Locksmith!<//text>

I understand customer service might not be the best here. You have to consider the the surrounding areas and how many rude people come in and out all day. For the area customer service is better than others. 5 stars because you can come in and out quick. The main reason they have the best best beer prices in the area. And are super cold almost to the point of freezing! Forgot to mention self opening sliding doors! No one has these around the area< /text>

You wouldn't guess from the street, but this place has some of the best burritos. They are huge and filled to capacity. Keep it simple, carne asada, rice, beans, cilantro, onion, and cheese with green salsa. So good...<//Review>

I ordered a cake for my son's first birthday smash cake. It turned out so cute and perfect! The bakery had everything I could ever want! I will be going back to them for any and all cake needs.< /review>

<text>I grew up with my dad in my ear always saying " I always buy all my meat at Albertsons"..   So as a adult I figured out why. Way more bang for your buck! GREAT GREAT prices on meat.... All the time. Some if not most other goods are a little on the pricey side.. But good quality<//text>< user_name>

<review>I understand people have their own views on COVID-19 and how their choosing to deal with the virus. BUT if you’re “management” at a grocery store with HUGE stickers and signs asking for patrons of the store to respect and comply with the 6 foot ordinance.

I have a issue with the way management choose to brush off an encounter a customer has with another when simply asking for some space. When customers get rowdy and rude you could step in defuse the issue not make excuses for harsh, disrespectful and utterly disgusting behavior.</review>< pictures>

Honestly, I have mixed feelings about Albertsons. It is a grocery store, with some other items. Those items have a quality that is pretty good, and sometimes even really good. But, those items have a price. Prices can be really high, but also sometimes pretty low.< /Review>

Was at the store Tuesday once I got in I saw a man with a light color jacket with no mask walking thru the store. He asked 2 employees a question. They did not react. I then told a manager pointed him out to her,she told me she would take care of it. She walked into the office behind the customer service counter. Never saw her come out. I am outraged to say the least. . we are talking about people's lives.. Called and asked. For the store director. Told he was not in<//review>

Some employees seem to be under the impression that they can dispense their opinions about donations when you don't want to give away money, or can't. I've been shamed by 2 employees so far, and I think that's AWFUL. A lady doesn't need to be reprimanded by someone 20 years younger than her. Shameful.<//review>

Pick up was slow and the wait was very long. Many system errors occurred. I would consider choosing GrubHub instead if you want to get food on time without any problems at all. Overall the store is okay but not the best choice for a quarantine food source.</text>

Albertson's is fine. I'm tired of their app though. If you don't add some things just right, you don't get the discount. I'm over it.< /Text>

Albertsons itself is fine but several of the employees are just way to much. For instance Chris the cashier feels the need ti continually tell everyone to step farther back even when we are on the red squares that Albertsons clearly marked as a safe distance. She did it ti me and the poor older woman behind me. I was in yhe red Square paying and the lady was on the next red square putting stuff on the belt. Albertsons is following all state and federal guidelines but I guess she know more than the corporation and the government. She wears the same gloves for every order which gross contaminates everything. When you're paying she tells you to back up more. How am I supposed to pay when I can't reach the pin pad lol. If she's that scared or at risk she should stay home and self quarantine.</text>

< Review>
When asked to find an item they carried, I was informed that their system does not allow them to look that information up. The manager stated they would look into getting a product they had that was there one day and gone the next, yet no one seemed to know anything and the manager was not able to fulfill my request. Pleasant employees who almost always greet the customer with a smile in an aging store that needs to step up to the 21st century.< /Review>

Nice workers and clean store.  They have a great solution for Covid19 distancing rules. Also were very adaptive to the current situation and the needs of our community.<//Review>

<review>Albertson's is a little more expensive on the majority of items than Wal-Mart or Target. But they do have a pretty good selection of things to choose from and usually do have what I need.

Albertsons wows me when I'm there. They're staff is friendly and accommodating. Shelves are stocked and organized. And clean. Can find what I'm looking for easily. Brand names like any supermarket. Produce is fresh. I can visit any time of day and same results as above. Pleasure to go to. And there are plenty of items on sale. Good values. Highly recommend. Been going there for one year now.</Review>

Always out of control dogs in the store, as a service dog trainer and handler, it is absolutely unacceptable how the management does not do anything to fix it.

Update, another dog barking at us in the store or dirty dogs in carts. The manager present was unhelpful but a different manager called me today to say it would be corrected and prevented from now on.

Another update, changed to 1 star because yet again another pet dog.< /review>

The Fallbrook Albertsons has a decent selection of fresh food as well as a simple sampling of vegan options in the Frozen food section. There is also a small refrigerator that has some dairy free cheese alternatives. The produce is usually fresh and there are organic fruits and vegetables. The manager claims they have an outdated inventory system and have no computer system to review their inventory so forget about asking if they carry something because they will just walk the isles with you to find an item; something I feel needs to be done to assist the customer.< /review>

The workers are nice but the store is disgusting. Especially the bathrooms, which are usually a good reflection of how clean the rest of the store is behind the scenes. They also run out of stuff all the time. They either don’t order enough or don’t stock it as often as they should. Not to mention how expensive they are. Things at Walmart are about half the price, sometimes less, for the exact same thing.<//Review>

<Text>I love this store. Great selection. Reasonable prices. Good customer service. The only reason I didn't go 5 stars is I miss self check out, and it takes longer to check out now that it's not available.<//Text>< time>

This Market has always been great. Thirty years of shipping here. Stores great, employees are awesome, customers vary a lot. Parking lot great, getting through it? Hmmm, watch yourself and the other guy. Like Disneyland on a Holiday.
Stores Great, enjoy< /review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>The prices are a bit higher than others in town. The quality and set up is pretty good. I love the people. Their vegetation is fresh, some local. The check outs are usually pretty busy. They often do sometime of rewards at the check out too which is kind of neat, if you like to participate in that sort of thing.<//review>< pictures>

I have ordered a birthday cake here for the past 4 years (about 6 cakes)
Two times the cake order couldn’t be found so I had to buy a premade cake. I don’t know how they LOSE ORDERS.
1 time they messed up the entire design. AND my son got a girl design cake.
1 time I selected a premade cake behind the glass display and they gave me the wrong cake and I only found out when I got home.
So buy a cake here at your own risk.
The only good part is they offer you a discount when they screw up your order.< /Text>

Great employees -very friendly and helpful. Honorable mentions: Terri (Terry?), Dulce, Carlos - a few others whose name I can't recall. Starbucks in store, as well as banking, and great floral - open until midnight - they will always check for an item not on the shelf. Some products and prices have changed since they absorbed Vons - not all for the better. I usually go after 8 pm to avoid crowds - hassle free shopping!</Text>

I want to thank the Manager, or who ever Hired Lydia Lee!!  She is the most courteous lady to ever work in the Deli. She goes out of her way to make sure we are happy shopping there. I ran in to her one nite in the parking area, and she came over to ask if I needed any help.  I like Albersons, but I love the chicken and saying Hi to Lydia!!!   Whoever is the Manager, I hope he or she passes this on to Lydia. I sure wish we had more people like her!!!!</review>

I love Albertsons! The store looks so amazing with their remodeling touch ups! The employees are great and the bagger Jeri is amazing! I hope they recognize her kindness and help with customers at the Fallbrook Ca. Store! I always look forward to seeing the employees! This store rocks and I'm a happy shopper! Thank you for your kindness!< /Review>

It just shows what type of business this is when their management is like this.. highly do not recommend Albertsons to anyone, i will even say that i highly discourage anyone from shopping here.< /Text><userid>104086316934563484552<//userid>< pics>

The specials are good deals. Always has a table of local products up front.  So popular that you can expect lines at checkout if you come near dinner time.</review>

Excellent candy aisle, tons of junk food for the once in a blue moon sweet tooth, other than that, the usual Albertsons shopping experience.< /Review>

The lines are almost always long. The organic produce as well as many other things in the store are overpriced compared to other stores in town and other than the few cashiers that I know and like, the vibe and customer service is bleh. I'm just not a big fan. I give it 3 stars though because the wine selection is usually pretty good and the displays are lovely.</Text>

<text>Best deals in town even without the savings card. They have the most variety and freshest fish too. They also have a sushi chef that makes it daily thats pretty good especially for grocery store sushi. The starbucks draws alot of customers too, being able to drink coffee and shop is amazing.<//text></record>

<review>First, let me start by saying that Albertsons in Fallbrook has always had great customer service but there are always a few that break the mold.

The gentleman that works nights cleaning the bakery and deli department is extremely rude.  I understand he wants to go home and people are probably asking for his help all the time, but barking loudly at customers, "CLOSED!" before I could even get one word out is not OK. This has happened to me on more than one occasion with him.

Secondly, when do customers that have $100+ order get handed their receipt and told to have a good night without their groceries put into the cart?  The customer behind me was done buying his items and I was still loading my cart with my groceries!

The daytime employees are always professional
helpful, and friendly.  Nighttime employees are  another story.< /review><user_id>112725758045212853938< /user_id>< date>

Not too many choices up here in Smallbrook but this is a big grocery store that has a great selection and good produce.  Prices are slightly higher than average, probably due to the location out here on the frontier.< /review>

Only go here for last minute shopping but they usually have what I need. I only go here because it's the only chain supermarket in town. It always smells like rotten meat. And parking here is a real rat race. WAY over priced!<//text>

At certain times there will be only one or two registers open, and the lines get a bit tedious. There is a starbucks kiosk inside, but the selection of meats could be better.</Text>

<review>The day after the new plastic bag ban went into effect in California, I visited this store. I only had a WalMart plastic bag in my car and there weren't reuseable plastic bags to buy at the store yet--so I brought in my WalMart bag. I used the self check out and had trouble with the payment portion of the transaction. The woman working at the self-check out came over to help me with my purchase. When she noticed my bag, she proceeded to shame me for going there. I shouldn't have to defend myself about this--but the store is close to my work--walmart is the only store near my home. I'm sorry that they are stealing your jobs, but if you don't have the supplies I need to complete my shopping trip, don't shame me for bringing the ones I bring.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>
