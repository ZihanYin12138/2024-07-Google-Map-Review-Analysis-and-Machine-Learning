<Text>I love Staters. Good prices, clean, good selection and they offer many other things like cooked meals, rotisserie chicken and baked goods! Also a long and good list of beer, wine alcohol and spirits in general.</Text>< Response>

It appears that some of the staff have an issue with black/brown customers.  For the most part the staff are nice.  But a few will not assist you if you happen to be black/brown.  I have experience this, unfortunately.
I will visit the one in Covina, the staff are nice and does not make one feel uncomfortable.<//Review>

<text>Lots of specials and even some bargains if you watch their ads. Nice fresh deli, cakes to order, and will even make you a sandwich  to order with any side you choose.  Good selection of produce, frozen food,  prepared deli items, a nice dairy box.
Butchers at the ready in the meat dept. Will slice and season your choice of meat if you choose. Also fresh fish and a variety of meat choices.  Prepackaged or fresh cut, trimmed and seasoned.  You choose.
I recommend this market.<//text>< Gmap_id>

I like shopping at Stater Brothers because their meat are very good and so is the price. The people that work there are friendly and outgoing and more than willing to help you if you need assistance.< /Text>

Wonderful service in the deli department.  I was appreciative that my sandwich was made with so much detail for my husbands lunches.
I ordered the 9.99 sandwich and the deli attendant put the lettuce and mayonnaise seperate for me.
I dont know her name but she was so wonderful at customer service.
The day before when i came in the other deli attendant stated she could not really make the sandwich she was not trained on making sandwiches and they did not have the bread to make the sandwiches, she was not helpful at all.
So it was wonderful that today the woman in deli gave me such great service.</Text>

< Review>
This morning I had a very bad experienced again; the butcher around 45 yrs old !
I  asked for 1.5 lb ground beef for my customer (I am an Instacart shopper)
What I found most of the beef are dark color what he explained no oxygen reached
The beef will turn dark color; I understand but I still hope he can give me more fresh and less dark meat!  His answer is put back the meat from the scales to the fridge!

If I shopped for myself I would walk away !
I always buy ground beef from VONS ! They provided good quality with good deal!<//Review>

<Text>Good prices, good produce, limited organic produce but a fair selection, and good meat. Helpful and pleasant personnel. Can be extremely crowded on weekends when students from Azusa Pacific and Citrus College shop in packs; however 99% of the students are also pleasant and helpful.  I have limited mobility and must use an electric shopping cart. Many students will offer to help me reach an item without me asking for assistance.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Short lines and a pretty decent selection for a relatively small Stater Bros. Really, no one reads Google Reviews though. You're probably just reading this because you where looking at the hours that they're open. Well, at the time of writing this, Google's hours are correct so that's a plus I guess</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c327cc36b1ea81:0x70207d681e6963aa< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great store. A little small so don't have as much of a selection as I'd like, but that appears to be the norm nowadays.  Always super friendly and helpful and fast checking out.  Great butcher section.  Not enough space to include bakery at this location<//text>

Deli department has a horrible customer service when it comes on ordering same day quick meals. Person helping gave me a Attitude when asking questions or ignoring when asking questions. If she doesn't want to work there she should find another job. Just for a quick family dinner it took close to 30mins to get it. Dont ever go there for picking up quick dinners.<//Text>

I like that it's clean and they have a good variety of products. The only problem are the cashiers. Almost every time stop in, I have to wait like 20 minutes in line and when I finally get to the cashier they never really look happy nor friendly. I'm sure not all of them are like this but, for the most part when I go in I get the gloomy gusses.</Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) It's a very good local market. There are a variety of items that can be bought cheaply with digital deals, the stores are clean, and the Diffies are good. I just don't think the staff are very friendly~

(Original)
아주 좋은 로컬마켓이에요. 디지털 딜로 싸게 살수있는 품목도 다양하고 매장도 깔끔하며 디피도 잘되어있어요. 단지 직원들이 그리 친절하진 않은 편인것 같아요~< /Text>

Been here several times and their mechanics and the front desk are super nice!!  They get the job done and the price is very reasonable, had minor issue with my steering wheel, without a question they take a look at it and fixed it in 10 minutes and they did not charge a dime!!! 👌 Excellent customer service, highly recommend Onsite for anyone in the area and will definitely coming back👍👍< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Stopped in here with my RAM 5500 and had them look at the whistling issue that no one else could seem to diagnose. The front desk was super helpful and got my truck in and looked at rather quickly. They sent me an email with the quote and complete diagnosis notes from the tech. I was able to approve the quote online and even had my own portal to see where the repair status was. My truck was back to me in 2 days and I was back on the road. I highly recommend them!!</review>< Pics>

Do not go here. They asked my partner to write a good review even after bad service.In exchange,  they will help move our truck to the yard. Please disregard the other reviews because i am sure they did the same thing to other customers to get good reviews. These people are very unprofessional and they have a 2hour minimum that they never tell you at first till you get there. They just tell you it is $105/hr and omit the two hour minimum on purpose. Please do not go her they are scammers and thieves.< /text>

Be warned!  If you are owner-Operator, try somewhere else. Safe yourself emotional stress and money. Thank me later:). I brought my truck here because it was overheating. We kept cooling it down to get here. This guys plugged in computer checks worth $300 and that was to be factored in the final pay if repairs were done warranted. Cool no problem. After a few minutes the lady sent me an email with a quote. Yes a quote was worth leaving truck on the side of the road , $7880. Well I told them I don’t have money and I need something they can do to help truck get home. Here is the worst part, the lady insisted there the truck is absolutely messed up and had to be put out of service. Telling me a bunch of things wrong.She swore there was no way it’s gonna make it through the desert unless I tow it all the way. Cut the story short we decided to get a load and drive. The truck not only delivered load but drove home  more than 1700 miles.</text>

I can not say enough good things about On Site. Kacie was always willing to go above and beyond for my company when we where in need of their expertise. One of the things I like the most about On Site along with all the technicians there was they were always on time and gave good quality work and professional work every time they showed up either at my shop or on one of my job sites.< /Review>

They had someone come out in minutes to take a look and tell me what I needed. They stayed late to get me going and even made special hose that dealer didnt have. APU and leak are fixed and I was able to pick up my load. I really appreciate the extra effort they did for me staying late. Nice to find a place that really seems to care about you.

BEWARE OF ONSITE TRUCK & EQUIPMENT REPAIR

We are so dissatisfied with our experience, I WOULD NEVER recommend ONSITE TRUCK & EQUIPMENT REPAIR to anyone.  ONSITE has caused tremendous problems for our trucking company and continues refusing to take responsibility for its service failures. We have lost thousands of dollars and continue to lose revenue daily because of ONSITE's unprofessional, incompetent repair work. It has been a terrible ordeal.

I bought a CAT long block and brought to Onsite to install it. After they installed it, they informed me that my injectors failed and recommended I replace them, which I authorized them to do. After I got my truck back, it ended up breaking down after about 600 miles. I got the truck towed to a dealer and they found the engine block had cracked. The dealer filed a warranty claim with CAT which was denied after CAT determined that Onsite installed the wrong injectors and flashed incorrect software as part of the attempted repair which voided the warranty. I did some research and discovered, Onsite refurbished my old injectors and re-installed them and charged me for new injectors. My truck has now been down for 2 months after I spent thousands of dollars at this shop.

Don't be fooled by promises on ONSITE's website. Truck owners should take note to avoid going through a similar expensive, exasperating, and stressful experience.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM.</Review>

< Review>
I bring my truck to them to change the 1 wheel seal on the drive axles. They estimate to repair             $682.50! I think they wanted to supply spare parts made of gold.  They took $ 95 from me just to see where the oil leak. I will never go to these people again....
They are very bad people.<//Review>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1591917388646, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear you had a negative experience at OnSite, however, your review does accurately reflect what took place. We gave you an estimate for what it would cost to inspect your unit to which you agreed to. After inspection, our technician found your brake linings were completely oil soaked due to the leaking wheel seal which is a DOT violation and needed to be replaced. We showed you everything that was needed.  You approved the estimate and we dispatched our parts driver to go to the dealer and pick up the parts right away. Twenty minutes after dispatching our driver, you informed us that you had a load that needed to be picked up and had to leave, however, you would be back the following day. We explained to you that your brake linings were soak with oil and in DOT violation. You told us you would risk driving but would be back the following day. We charged you the original, agreed upon, inspection fee of $95 that  was quoted to you. We told you that we would credit the inspection charge back to you when you brought the truck back in the following day; which you did not do. We are sorry you do not agree with the charge, however, the Technician, Service Writer, Parts Manager and Parts Runner times and fuel costs are not free.'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb14428c20103:0x31acc8a4c5bc815f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We have been doing business with Henry (Onsite Truck & Equipment Repair) since July 2012.  I have Diesel Trucks, Skid Steers, Skip Loaders, Paving Machine and other specialty equipment, which it is difficult to find a Mobile Service that is qualified and able to perform service & repairs on all the various types of equipment. All of his staff is always very helpful and explain what they need to do and estimate how long it will take to do the repairs, inspections or P/M. You can depend on him.</review>

Came in, they did the diagnostics and gave an estimate. Estimate seemed fine in the beginning and the next morning they started working on my truck. Within two hours once they took of the part on my truck, she tells me that they gave me a wrong quote, here is the new price where it is increasing for $1K. How do you give an estimate and after you take the part off the truck, your quote is wrong for 40% of intitial quote??? Because they know that your truck is in and the part has been removed, you have no choice but agree. The truck had to get done in 1.5 day, ended up being there for 3 days. They told me the truck is ready for a test drive but now I have an exhaust leak from EGR Valve that I never had before. Mechanic had to remove the exhaust pipes to get to oil filter unit that was being fixed. Of course, another quote for $1K is ready to take care of the exhaust leak. That’s when I said I will take the truck with exhaust leak because while I was there for 3 days in their shop, 90% of people coming to pick up so called ‘fixed trucks’ came back within 30 minutes still having issues. Went to VOLVO dealer and had to end up paying another $650 for replacing a new exhaust pipe gasket that they broke while putting it back together. They will quote you low in the beginning, once your truck is in, they will milk you and keep causing other minor issues to suck out your money. You will end up paying there more than at an authorized dealership and I doubt them fixing the issue properly. Very dissatisfied, my oil leak is still there, I paid ton of money but at least you would expect to have an issue fixed right? No, it is still there. I don’t recommend this place at all, unless you have lots of money that you want to throw away out of the window... Got all the paperwork to prove!</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1555439758187, 'text': 'First and foremost we would like to apologize that you were not satisfied with your experience at OnSite and left unhappy with our service. It is our goal not only to meet our customers expectations but to exceed them. Your unit did come in for inspection for the oil leaks; at that time our technicians did a complete inspection on your unit as well as look at your concerns. We made sure to take you out back and show you everything that was wrong with your unit and give you honest answers on what were urgent repairs and what could wait. Your list included: transmission leaks; coolant leaks; oil filter housing leaks; torque arm bushings and differential leaks. You chose to repair the oil filter housing and the torque arms after seeing the complete estimate for everything. When we began to remove the oil filter housing, our technician could not remove the last bolt due to clearance issues with the EGR cooler that was not spelled out in our estimating software. We showed you the predicament. We were not aware (prior to starting the job) that the EGR cooler needed to be completed. Once we were aware that it needed to be removed, we made sure to advise you that we had to remove it in order to move forward. You chose to remove the cooler and proceed with repairs (which did raise the bill). We worked within your budget as asked and gave all discounts available. We only purchase parts from the perspective dealer and we had to wait on the correct parts which did push the repair a day and we are very sorry for the delay as we expressed. In regards to the exhaust leak, we made sure you were aware before you left that there was an exhaust leak. The exhaust leak can happen when removing parts and reinstalling them. We try our very best to be careful, however, when dealing with rusted parts and torque, there is no way to prevent it from happening since everything has to be torqued to specifications. We offered to change the part for no labor and just charge you the cost of the part and you stated it would be fine and you would have it completed back in Florida. As a courtesy we also took you to and from your hotel to make your situation more convenient. We try to go above and beyond in every situation because we value our customers and their concerns. We do not do bate and switch; we run our business honestly. We are very sorry your experience did not match your expectations. We would greatly appreciate another chance to earn your business and make the situation right for you.'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb14428c20103:0x31acc8a4c5bc815f</Gmap_id></record>

{'time': 1591936203555, 'text': 'Hi Umid, I am sorry you were not happy with the work that Onsite provided you. When you brought in your Volvo tractor, your complaint was noises/vibration coming from the front brakes and the front steering pulling. You told us that the rear brakes were just recently done and not to look at them. Upon inspection we found your front king pins and tie rod ends were completely worn out. This is to be expected on a unit with almost a million miles. We found the front brake linings and drums to be worn out. There was also an ABS sensor issue. We replaced the king pins and front brakes. We cleaned the ABS sensors causing the ABS fault to clear. We took you for a test drive and you said that things seemed better but that there was still something wrong with the front. We pulled the unit back into the shop for further inspection. We started inspecting the rear brakes; it was at that point that you went passed our posted "employees only" sign and went into the shop without authorization and proceeded to yell at our tech saying "what are you doing, I told you guys not to look at the rear brakes." We explained that for your safety and liability reasons, you can not go into the shop unaccompanied and without wearing the proper PPE. You proceeded to complain to my service writers and told them not to look at the rear brakes. After taking the unit for another test drive and closer inspection of the rear brakes, we found the brakes to be new but not adjusted correctly and the brake shoes were walking back and forth almost a quarter of an inch out of the drum due to your S cam bushings being worn out. They should have been probably replaced at the shop that just replaced your rear brakes. We showed you all that was going on with your brakes and suggested you take the truck back to where you spent your hard earned money, to which you said "I don\'t want to talk about them, if you replace the S cam bushings can you guarantee that will fix the problem and that nothing else will be needed?" I informed you that I would have to pull everything apart and inspect all the rear brake components and measure the drums to see if there are other unseen issues. You asked your same question again. I got a feeling you did not trust what I was saying. I said that I highly recommend that you should take the truck back to the company that just did your rear brakes. You already paid them to do a job that you should not repay someone to do again. At this point you became irate and started blaming us for body damage that extended down both sides of your truck that we already documented when we wrote up your vehicle before we even had anything to do with your unit. At this point, we were no longer comfortable working with you and repeated an additional time that you needed to take the truck back to the company that previously replaced your rear brakes.'}< /resp>

Onsite goes above and beyond with proper and efficient repairs the first time. Always in communication with their customers no matter the size of a job. Definitely recommend to owners who are tired of being lied to. Customer satisfaction and safety is paramount.<//Review>

<Text>There won't be enough characters in this review to express how awesome the owner and crew at onsite really are. I've been there on numerous occasions and they have always been up front with part cost and labor prices. They moved incredibly fast to get the parts and service the vehicle to get it back out on the road. We all know time is money and the team at onsite fully understand this. The owner was gracious enough to provide me with a ride back to our shop while they worked on the vehicle. Honestly wish I could say more just haven't had enough experiences with these guys just yet as they do such a great job with their repairs. Lifetime customer in me for sure thanks guys for your hard work and diligence in taking care of you customers.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1513105808575, 'text': 'Thank you'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb14428c20103:0x31acc8a4c5bc815f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I am the Transportstion Specialist at Greenline Transportation and I can say without a doubt that this is the best mechanic shop that we have encountered. We have used pretty much every shop in the Ontario/ Fontana area but many places were either a rip off or they took forever to get a job done. OnSite has the most affordable shop fee and they get jobs done faster than anywhere else. The girl who works the front desk does such a good job of staying on top of jobs and keeping us posted on our tractors. I could not be happier with the service we receive!<//review>< Pics>

I usually don’t write bad reviews but this rubbed me the wrong way. Now first of all, everyone that I met at the shop were really cool people which is why I’m upset that I even have to write this review but being cool doesn’t excuse professionalism. I took my truck up here to get my APU checked out and hopefully fixed. They said they would diagnose it & it was $100/hr. Ok, cool, not a problem. They diagnose it for about 3 hrs & finally think that it is a pressure switch which costs about $80. They tell me they can order it & it should be here by Monday. I’m like Ok cool no problem. I pay the $300 for the diagnostic & walk to my truck to leave. The problem is that there is stuff still unscrewed in my cab and in my sleeper. It seemed like they were rushing to get out of there because it was a Friday evening So i let them know there are a couple things that need to be screwed back on so I can take my truck & we can all leave. So instead of them screwing them properly back in they just take the screws and put them under my sleeper bunk & tell me they’ll put them back properly on Monday when your part comes. Once again I’m like ,”Ok cool no problem”. So Monday comes I call them up the part is not there they said they would call me back when it gets there. Long story short it’s been a month & still no word from them, no call back & I had to put the pieces they took off on my truck back in myself properly. Like I said you guys were cool but that’s not how you do business especially being that what I came for didn’t even get fixed.</Review>

<Review>Very bad experience with this place, this place nearly put me out of business. 60 day warranty has no value when mechanics are incompetent.
I went in for my freightliner shaking and tire wear, along with other problems that needed to be addressed.

1)air leak on trailer brake chamber. replaced brake chamber but left the  threaded  hooked rod in brake chamber that keeps spring compressed while installing . i still had brake chamber air leak as well. i fixed myself and put dust cap on.
2) replaced carrier bearing and they suggested i balance my driveshaft. Ok. paperwork says driveshaft came back with no issues and truck was test drove running smooth. This is on my paperwork!!!  Truck shook so bad it was barely drivable.  It was flat worn out due to truck having so many miles and Onsite making it worse and i do mean worse.  truck was jacked up at another shop, run through a few gears and i saw for myself how bad driveshaft bounced and shook my drive tires. They told me I could have lost my driveshaft on the street. that could cause serious damage to my truck and God forbid my driveshaft were to hit another vehicle.
3) rear brakes and drums. installed, 1 out of 4 brakes were adjusted correct. The other 3 would have put me "out-of service" at a weigh station had i not checked adjustment myself. i asked that S-cam seals be replaced. not replaced. not charged for it but not done.
4) Leveling valve. Was charged for leveling valve. all they changed was leveling valve rod, which was 3 full inches to short  from freightliner specs
5) 3 axel alignment, oh good lord have mercy. they screwed that one up so bad. manager at a reputable place started laughing and wondered if the guy was blind.  You can just look at it and see its off.  other shop did great job, very happy.

Onsite was very expensive. I was out of work for 3 weeks between Onsite and 3 other shops to fix Onsite screw ups. should have been 1 full week.
nice people, but ill never be back again.</Review>< username>

Read my review on Access San Fernando 24 hour vet to better understand one of the reasons why VCA Chatsworth is so appreciated by me.  This is one Five Star reviewed place that I personally vouch for.

Without getting into too much detail in this review, I'll share that I had two visits to Access on Sunday with neither one answering what was wrong with my boy.  Monday morning, I called VCA and even though they are booked solid, after hearing about my issues with the emergency vet, they squeezed in my boy.

The emergency vet could not diagnose my boy, because they said that he was too big and too strong to handle.   At VCA, the vet tells me "he isn't resisting.  He is a sweetheart.  He doesn't like to be on his side so we didn't force him. We just let him think he was in control and he let us check his paws"..... IMAGINE THAT???  A vet and vet's office that understands how to interact with their animal client....

They found that he has redness in his paw.  No puncture wounds, but definitely something to cause extreme pain.  They drew up an exam plan:  xray; blood work; sedation; etc...  Everything I had had hoped the 24 hour place would have done a day earlier, but they didn't.

VCA took care of my baby, and as a result, took care of my emotional state.  I trust them.  I don't question treatment plans.  Costly? Worth it.  I have pet insurance and even though it will still be a good amount out of pocket, it is worth it.

After my boy was discharged today, I called the office to thank the staff and the vet for taking care of my baby.< /review>

This vet has to be one of the kindness, most understanding and most compassionate veterinarian iv ever met.
She shows love and empathy for your pet as well as the pet parent. She's not only a great person, she's a phenomenal vet whom I trust, love and adore. She takes the time to answer all your questions, review all options, she has a remarkable way of explaining things in a way that make you feel confident and thoroughly informed and I trust her and her staff so completely. She loves my pugs genuinely and it shows every time we come in. Knowing that she is amazing and thoroughly educated and competent when it comes to veterinary medicine lets me know my 2 puggies are always in the right hands with her. I can't thank her enough. She says she will treat my babies like her own and she does. I love that!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>This was the third or forth time I went to VCA.
My dog had an allergic reaction and his hind leg was also swolen.
Long story short, I feel like I was charged over $ 400.00 for no reason (we did get meds for this price too), and would be charged a lot more if I agreed to the rest of their sales pitches.
Another Vet employee (not a Doctor...) saw what was wrong with Tank's leg and knew exactly what was wrong and they took care of it right away without trying to charge me $ 400 for X-Ray and pump the poor puppy full of meds.
I am very disappointed that a living creature is just a means of up charging for VCA.
I will never go back and would never recomend anyone to go here.
Since running a business on up selling people and playing on the connection with their pets is wrong.
BTW, Tank's leg was not fractured. He had Fox tail under the skin which was casing the inflammation.

I usually never leave negative reviews. This is my first. So I am not one to complain about things.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I never take the time to write a review. But after several visits to Chatsworth Veterinary Center. You feel like you have to. From the front office personnel all the way to Dr. Schneider they're amazing in every way. Dr. Schneider takes the time to call you to see how your pet is doing and not only once several times. If you don't answer he will leave you a message. I have been in many Veterinary office and this is the first time I get this amazing service. Dr. Schneider and all personnel thanks for the amazing services. Keep up the good work.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c29cb73aa4886d:0x2c598bf6ceefa1d< /gmap_id>< rating>

If there was an option to rate 10+ that would be my rating.  I have trusted the care of my fur babies to Dr. Suzi and staff for the past 16 years.  She is an amazing diagnostic and reasonable doctor; always has the welfare of your pet first and forward.  I trust her completely and she continues to be spot on in her treatment recommendations.  I highly recommend this accredited hospital and would trust none other to care for my pets, period<//text>

<Review>I've been taking my dog here for two years (for check ups, emergencies, and boarding). My dog has extremely severe allergies, and Dr. Milder has really been able to help us. She treats Honey with such care, like she is her own dog. Honey is normally SOOO scared of people, but she really loves Dr. Milder!! She has always offered the very best advice, and she regularly goes above and beyond. I've spoken to the staff and they all say they love their job because the doctors here love their patients so much. The passion for your pet is felt the second you walk in the door.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

FANTASTIC Place to take care of your Pet. Our dog has IMHA. She requires Med's and monitoring. They did a fantastic job watching her while we were out of town. They gave her the required Med's and lots of TLC. I can't recommend them any higher.<//text>

<review>I would NEVER EVER go back to this place again. They never care for your dog. I repeat, NEVER CARE!!!!!. I took my dog to this clinic and after some test they want to euthanise (spelling) my dog. I went to another vet for a second opinion and they gave my dog medications. Two weeks later now my dog is strong. Although my dog is dying, I can still spend time with him.< /review>< Response>

Their "de Riguer " includes walks in their fenced area, twice per day, top of the line food products ,which Rocky loves and most importantly, a professional and caring staff. Exceptionally clean facility. Great vets who are always looking after his best interest. This IS the best facility in the Valley.< /review>< username>

< Review>
They have a Clover brewing machine here, which makes a single cup of coffee made to order for you. I definitely recommend trying your favorite Starbucks coffee on it. Yesterday I had a Jamaica Blue Mountain and it was really good.

Today I came from another store's drive thru and the coffee they gave me was cold. I came in here and they gave me a new cup, no problem.< /Review>

<Review>I consider Starbucks overpriced, but convenient in location and meeting a corporate level of quality. The location in my local Safeway allows me some caffeine while I plan menus and talk to seafood, meat and deli counters. The employees have all been friendly. No complaints.< /Review><rate>2< /rate>< Pictures>

Went I for my birthday which was yesterday, a Sunday and was told only good on actual birthday. My faith does not allow me to work or shop on Sundays. You should change this policy to allow everyone to use it maybe within a couple of days, it used to be the entire month!!</Text>

It's no different than any other Starbucks. Coffee drinks are ok, although everything is too sweet. The pastries are mass produced and nothing special. The sandwiches are meh and tiny.< /Review>

The guys are pretty decent and displays the ladies here are so uptight they don't even acknowledge you that's if you're just a number to them.
I'd say a little bit odd  and awkward at times.
Oh well... there's nothing we can do we can change people.
I'm changing my rating of this place and I've been going in there and they have really improved a lot so I'm changing my reading to four stars because they've been doing an outstanding job lately and I also think that is fair for people to know that.<//review>

<Review>This is easily my favorite Starbucks. I don't always drink Starbucks, but there's not always time to make it to a specialty coffee shop, and this Starbucks has a large selection Reserve coffees. Also, the manager Vernon is a real coffee officianado and cares about his guests' experience. If you like Starbucks, this is the best one in the area, and if you don't like Starbucks, you should come in and give Vernon's shop a chance.</Review>< username>

Not as nice to stop at because that area is so busy. Cars always at the intersection right next to them & 2 gas stations at 2 of the other corners there. 2 great size shopping centers on each side of the road where they're place is at one of them. That area is just always busy so when you're there you're just watching & hearing boring traffic.</Text>

<Review>The Barista Jarrod was extremely rude to me and my wife. He made our drinks poorly and then refused to let a nice woman use the restroom while having a feminine issue that required the bathroom. He then gave us dirty looks and a poor attitude after we gave her the bathroom code. He then made a snide remark as we were leaving the store. I will not be returning to this location.< /Review>< Response>

Quick service. Could use more help in keeping place cleaner. Overwhelmed with customers so it's difficult for employees to keep up.</text>

This is a nice location for a Starbucks. It has the park across the street, the Library and the neighborhood is decent/quiet compared to most.< /Text>

<Review>Busy location with not enough people working at once. Barista was not very friendly to me as I was waiting for my drink, she found it on the bar and told me twice that it had already been called, as if trying to prove she did everything correctly and I wasn't listening... However, I was standing there the entire time and my drink was not called, but instead was placed on the bar with no writing on the cup, so I had no clue it was mine. It was a poor experience overall.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>It's a meat shop and small restaurant. The food is authentic home made. They are mostly known for their menudo and Birria . The menudo is authentic and not the canned garbage a lot of restaurants serve to try to pass as home made. The Birria is also delicious. Both have great seasoning taste . recommend< /text>< Pictures>

This place is trash had very bad service and when I first walked in there was a bad smell and my food was cold and not cooked good also the people are very rude and the restaurant is very small and there was a guy playing a game behind me and it was very irritating and I couldn’t eat in peace also the place is very unorganized and didn’t have many forks or spoons or containers to put sauces inside so I don’t recommend this for anyone unless you want to eat with people all up on you and very bad service.Also they have very expensive food for it being cold. I knew we should have left when we first walking into the restaurant. The chairs are also very broken so sit down with your own risk.< /Review>

This place is terrible would not recommend the workers are lazy and unprofessional, there were no utensils they had to be asked for and the plates alone were styrofoam the environment is dirty and loud. Not a good place for a quick bite.</text>

I got a chicken burrito from this place the other week and it was absolutely amazing, better than most the Mexican restaurants around here in Fontana. I've lived down the street from this place for 2 years now, I wish I would have tried this Taqueria sooner. Their hot sauce is so good, so much flavor!</text>

I went in there 1 HR before it close and I had some old lady in most rudest way scream at me on what I wanted. So I just said it's ok and walked away. Will never return to this place.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Unpleasant. Terrible place. Bad attention. It has no air conditioning. You often get it cold without a spoon, without lemons, with nothing ... just tortillas until you order them. A lot of noise in there. Bad smell. Prices the same as everywhere. Not recommended ..

(Original)
Nada agradable. Pésimo Lugar. Mala atención. No tiene aire acondicionado. Un menudo te lo dan frío sin cuchara, sin limones, sin nada...solo tortillas hasta que las pides. Mucho ruido ahí dentro.

<text>First time here and we were not disappointed. About $8.50 for the flight of beers. 4 beers in this flight. See pics for the names of the beers. We will be back later in the month of August when they have their sour beers.  They had some folks selling some Mexican food in the parking lot and serving the orders to the customers inside the brewery. Nice! So give them a try. They staff was friendly and knowledgeable.<//text>< user_id>

<Text>This place is on point. They have great beers, a great atmosphere, and an awesome team. If you haven't been here yet you need to make a point to stop in. The beer is nice and cold and they have a good variety.<//Text><user_id>115417224340339982541<//user_id><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

<Review>Tried several of their beers and was not disappointed. My wife does not drink beer often but the bartender offered a "beermosa" which she fell in love with. We showed up during an open mic, which is every 1st & 3rd Sunday. The music was surprisingly good and volume was appropriate for the size of the tasting room. We'll be back<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have been to many small, craft breweries on the west coast. Zone 9 has to be one of the best. They always have diverse selection of beers on tap, something for everyone. I have never had a beer I did not like. They take great pride in making some of the best craft beer in California.</text>

<Review>Amazing cookies! I won't buy anything I can make myself that's tastier, and these cookies definitely are worth the price.

A little spendy? Yes. But which cookies in a downtown shop aren't going to have to be pricier?

They don't look like much, but who cares! They taste incredible!< /Review>< Pictures>

I rated 1 star mainly because I don't like by the slice pizza places... They are sort of gross...has a lot of room for improvement! Take a look at Paul's live from new york! They have better process where pizza doesn't just sit under heat lamp forever</Text>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I visit a lot of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The team is very welcoming and the cuisine they cook is so yummy. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice meal here. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

In 7th grade at Sunny Brae middle school if you read so many books you'd get a smugs pizza and if your class read the most boos the entire class would get a pizza party for smugs. It's a taste that takes me back to being a child. The crust is a dreamy crunchy garlicky soft bread. Their pizza sauce taste like the tomatoes were grown in Tuscany. The cheese, uh the cheese. Smugs is so flipping amazing! A must try if you're visiting Humboldt. Love you Smugs :)<//text>

Do you know how hard it is to find a place that will sell you two slices of premium, delicious pizza that's already ready to go for a flat 5 dollars? It's darn near impossible. Smugs will, though. Easily my favorite pizza, ever.</review>

Always a good place to go when you aren’t sure what’s for dinner. My husband and I love the fluffy crust, it has good flavor and the price is good.</text>

The price is good and the pizza had good flavor, but you could tell it had been sitting out for awhile. I assume it would be even better fresh!< /review>

I called in my order and got the 2 slices and a drink combo, the food was ready when I arrived and it was delicious. It was definitely fresh and probably some of the best pizza I have had since living up here in Humboldt county. I will definitely be going back!<//Text>

There pizza to go is the best option in both Eureka and Arcata. For $5, you get two of the same slice and wow, do they have a variety of slices. Not too greasy, but still a great amount of cheese. GF options available, too.</Review>

< review>
Ill give them the benefit of the doubt here because I came in right when they opened but the pizza was... Well I would say mediocre, (literally) the mushrooms and bell peppers pretty much still raw pretty much. The pizzas taste was meh. If I were to make this at home and tried to replicate it the best I could, I would slap a piece of inflated pita bread down cover it with grease, some tomatoes from the can, so they're nice and tinny, throw the onions bell peppers mushrooms and a pound of olives on there(i like olives but I didn't order a olive pizza) and meat on there. A whole package of cheese on there and throw it in the oven for 5 minutes to make sure the raw onions where the highlight of the meal and the cheese is a little over half melted. I was in town for graduation but honestly everything I found in Humboldt county was vegan co ops vegan bakeries and cafes thank god eel river brewery was on the way home! Now that place knows how to cook! And great beers on tap!</review>

My sister in law is a long time client of Jeff's, so I knew I was going to get exactly what I wanted. Little did I know he would exceed my expectations. The place was super clean and sanitized. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thanks again Jeff!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80db27ef7d73ee05:0xb382e707d8fa80a3< /gmap_id></record>

Seriously some of the best group of artist in one place!!!! I’ve been getting tattooed by Jeff for 13+ years. When I first got tattooed by Jeff I had 3 tattoos now I have 16🤔?... and he has done an amazing job covering 2 of my previous tattoos. His detail and color are like no other! I get stopped every time I go out “Wow who does your work it’s amazing!!!”  I also have a tattoo done by Matthew Dyson at the shop. Jeff is currently working on my Disney Princess sleeves (pictures included). Every time I get work I glance at the other artist work being done it’s all amazing such a great group of talent! If you want to get stand out work that will exceed your expectations stop by ‘Liquid Tattoo’ or their sister shop in 29 Palms, ‘Solid Tattoo’. Great group of artist you’ll walk out beyond happy and in love!!!< /text>

Phillip was amazing!  We were from out of town and walked in to get three small tattoos and he was able to get us all in that day.  He had such a light hand and my tattoo looked great!  He was very personable and made it a great experience.  Wish I lived closer so I could go to him for all my future tats.  Highly recommend!!< /Review>

I will never go anywhere else.
Magic with sprinkles, that’s what you get here.

My first tattoo ever was done by Jeff Cooper which was the feather. A little over a year later and I went big! I went for the Lion with lots of pictures and said please make magic. He did. Jeff did an amazing job. I love it and it’s not even done. He even incorporated part of my existing feather. Just in awe of how he was able to create something that is so meaningful to me and so beautiful.

I will admit that I did get teary eyed and ran out like a weirdo because I was so emotional. I reached out to let Jeff know that I loved it and he was even more awesome and super humble.

This an amazing studio with great artist. It’s clean and the staff are friendly and really take the time to listen to what is Important to you.

Jeff Cooper you rock my socks! This was definitely magic with sprinkles. I love it!</Text>

He is very light handed, but the color holds true. All the artists at Liquid put out great work, so you can’t go wrong with any of their crew. I get compliments on my ink everywhere I go and constantly recommend Liquid.</text>< Pictures>

I go to Liquid and more specifically Jeff for all of my tattoo needs. It’s always nice and clean and everyone working there is really nice and professional. Jeff takes my ideas and makes them better than what I could’ve imagined. I’ll keep going to Liquid for all my tattoos. Highly Recommended<//Text>

Jeff Cooper is the man! He’s been working on my sleeve for a few years now, always brings what I want to light and then some. He’s amazing with colors, goes all in on details, and has even helped me create and design a personal memorial piece. If you’re looking for amazing tattoos, good, clean, fun space, you found it!<//Text>

Jeff is one of the best tattoo artists around. He knows the skin so well, and has an incredible artistic ability. He has done several mind blowing coverups for my wife and I, as well as other pieces. From traditional to realism, this shop has what you’re looking for.< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Absolutely extremely satisfied with my tattoo!!! Matt Dyson was my tattoo artist, and hands down this guy knock my tattoo outta the park! The attention to detail with the lion is extraordinary. I can say enough about his precession he work's with. From the time I went in to check Liquid Tattoo out, to the time I left after my tattoo was finished everyone that I spoke to were very approachable and delightful. The chill atmosphere, to the well kepted tattoo shop, to the warm welcome, is reassurance to it's finest. Depending on the work you want done, the price is reasonable. I highly recommend Liquid Tattoo period if you are in the market for a tattoo. I will definitely be back!!!< /text>< pictures>

This place had a very cool professional vibe. It was very clean and their standards are impeccable. I suggest anyone who wants a clean well done artist tattoo give liquid tattoo a try. I've had a few tattoos from here along with family members as well. We all still love our tattoos. Philip was our artist. Thank you for a killer job my man.</review>

Love this Tattoo Studio! Houses some of the best tattoo artist in the high desert! Jeff Cooper is absolutely amazing along with his crew, also his crew at Solid Tattoo in 29 palms! I have been going to this tattoo studio for many years now, and is one of my go to spots for tattoos.<//Review>

And she decided she wanted a tattoo. After looking at Liquid Tattoos website, we thought we would give them a call to see if they take walk-ins. Luckily we caught them right when they opened, and they were not busy. My wife absolutely loves her new tattoo!. Thanks guys! 👍👍</text>< username>

I went to multiple tattoo shops before them to get a pricing and the tattoo that me and my girlfriend wanted costed around $140 each. And we had to get the tattoo drawn minimalistically to afford it. However, we came here and we got our tattoos with the total cost of $140 and with all the detail included. They are very professional, I will let the work they have displayed in the front of their shop do the talking because it is top notch. Their service is great and they will get you what you want. Clean and thorough. 100% satisfied with what I have on my body. I am keeping in contact with my artist because he knows what I want next.<//Text>

Jeff Cooper and staff are very talented, knowledgeable, and accommodating to bring your visions to life. Each artist has their own distinct style and all around the prices are very reasonable for good quality work. Very clean environment and all tattoo needles and barrels are opened in front of you from sterile packaging, clean technique is performed everytime. Tattoo's, when taken care of as instructed heal very nicely and the color blooms to life in not just my own, but from the many tattoos I have seen from their work on their facebook page.< /text>

This is one of the best shops you'll ever walk into! Everyone is super nice,professional, and fun. Its a great atmosphere. Very clean and well decorated. I was there for 12 hours and I didn't even mind that much. It was actually really fun. They were very hospitable which is so wonderfully strange nowdays,especially for a tattoo shop. Every single artist who works there does beautiful work. They seem like a very dedicated bunch. I HIGHLY recommend Liquid Tattoo. Their art work is beyond amazing, they could be charging way more than they do. But they're awesome people and they know how it is nowdays. Just check them out on Facebook and youll see what i mean. My tattoo artist was Rich Pineda. A beautiful and stunning Elvira is now on my leg forever thanks to him :)</review>

I highly recommend CWT. Very professional group.  CWT communicates very effectively to make sure all our needs were met.  They followed up a few times before our trip to confirm all details and see if we needed anything else.  And our drivers, Joe and Ray, were AWESOME.  They were professional, funny and kept us on track for a great NAPA/Sonoma wine experience.  Thanks again.</review>

Booking our Napa trip transportation mad wine tastings was wonderful. Jamie made great winery recommendations. The driver Thomas was prompt, professional, and entertaining through out the day! I highly recommend California Wine Tours for you’re next visit.< /Text>

Our driver Brett was the absolute best, from the moment he picked us up to the moment he dropped us off. He even made reservations for us for the next day at a place he thought we would enjoy. Which we did very much. Jamie who helped plan our day was so helpful, took the time to answer all my phone calls and emails. I would recommend them to other people going to Napa, and use them again on my return. Thanks for making my birthday a great day!< /review>< user>

We had a wonderful day in Sonoma! Our driver Brent went above and beyond to make our experience great. He was on time, prepared, very personable and extremely knowledgeable about the area and wineries. He took many pictures of our group which wasn’t expected but was a nice touch. I highly recommend this company and requesting Brent as your driver.
Kendric was the sales rep I worked with, she was very easy to work with in planning our day and was quick to respond. We had a great experience in Sonoma!<//review>

I scheduled 10 transfers with multiple locations and people during a 3 day meeting in Napa. CWT was fantastic from the reservation calls to the drivers and their vehicles.  I had to run a rental car back to town and could not get an Uber to save my life. I called CWT, they were so accommodating and sent someone to rescue me and I was back working in no time.  I felt very confident that the rides and my guests were handled professionally.   Thank you again CWT!</Review>

I recently flew into Santa Rosa airport and had to get to Napa. Due to Covid, regular airport transfer services were not available. CWT was the fourth company I called and by that time I was feeling pretty agitated about the whole thing. The office staff were so kind! They let me know that they were really busy but that they would see what they could juggle in their schedule to help me out. They called back very quickly and were able to fit me in. I really appreciated being able to make further arrangements by text, including for the return journey. My driver was there on time and easy for me to spot. It was a bonus that he had a lot of local knowledge, and we had a great chat about the area all the way to my destination. On my return journey I had a similar, seamless, relaxing experience. Even if you're on a tight budget, I would seriously consider spending out on this service. The amount of worry and stress you will save yourself, being able to completely relax and trust these folks to get it right, is absolutely priceless.</Text>

The wine tour was amazing!   Richard our driver was outstanding, very accommodating, personable and hospitable! Jamie ; who set up our tours was awesome! She was in contact with us constantly and we were very pleased with the results. She did everything to make our vacation so effortlessly!  I would recommend California Wine tour to anyone looking for tours and they are so professional and accommodating!  Thank you all for a very lovely experience and a great vacation.

My husband and I were in town for our 27th wedding anniversary. Jamie put together an amazing tour visiting and tasting three beautiful wineries. Her communications were prompt and friendly. She sent champagne, beer, a really nice stretch SUV and a very personable driver, Ray. Ray was awesome! He even took pictures of us outside each winery without being intrusive. We enjoyed his company quite a bit. I would highly recommend and ask for Jamie and Ray!<//Text>

Thomas Lay was our driver for the weekend and he was very professional, accommodating, courteous, and prompt. We can't say enough good things about Thomas! We were transported in an 8 person Mercedes Sprinter - wow! Very luxurious! We will definitely use California Wine Tours again!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Jamie with CWT was so easy to work with, she was quick to respond and helped plan the perfect first day of Napa for our group of 4 celebrating our 40th birthdays!! She had so many great suggestions, made all our tasting appointments and helped order food and setup a picnic.  Brent Finger was an exceptional driver and guide. He was on time, friendly and kind, felt like he was part of our group! He gave a ton of information and suggestions along our drive. He kept in constant contact with us and informed our next tastings of delays due to road conditions. He helped with our Champagne lunch and took lots of pictures for us. He continued to ensure our experience was to our satisfaction and a memorable one. If we ever have another visit out he will definitely be part of it by request. Not having to worry about navigating through Napa Valley and not having to drive after so many amazing stops and lots of wine tasting was the best decision. We loved California Wine Tours!!<//Text>< UserId.>

We had a FANTASTIC time with CWT taking us around to different wineries. This was our first trip to California and we were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary.  Mike, the owner, went over the top to make sure our experience was phenomenal from the start! Kendric made all reservations for us, we didn't have to do anything. Our driver, Thomas, was the absolute best. He was friendly, very professional, and made the day extra special. He knew so many facts about California, super smart, funny all round great person! We will definitely use them again and recommend their services to ANYONE AND EVERYONE!!!!!!<//Review>

California Wine Tours exceeded my expectations! My Wife and I came to Napa to celebrate my 40th birthday and we booked our Tour through CWT. Jammie Brown is who helped us and she went above and beyond to ensure our trip was as memorable as possible. Our driver Thomas was totally knowledgeable about all of the rich history of Napa and even suggested great restaurants to try. Overall it was a phenomenal experience and worry free thanks in part to CWT! We’re already planning our next trip back!!</review>

I booked and paid for a BMW 7 Series to transport two of us from San Francisco to Napa. I was looking forward to spoiling us.  Without any advance notice a Chevy suburban that could likely fit 7 passengers arrived. Very disappointing since I was looking forward to the luxury.  They certain charged enough… I commented to the company after the fact and they said the suburban cost more.  I should have said so does a school bus!  I thought it was a ridiculous response.

I do not recommend. (Unless you want a suburban, or a school bus).<//text>

Our experience with California Wine Tours was amazing! We were first timers looking
to book something for Valentine’s Weekend. Jamie made the experience seamless from top to bottom. She communicated really well with me and even used my preferred method (text!!) The day of, our driver, Mr. Biggins definitely set the vibe. He was great! We made it to all stops early and were really able to enjoy the experience without time or tipsy driving being a concern. We can’t wait to go back and will definitely continue to use CWT. 😊<//review>

We had a blast with all of our tastings! The communication throughout the entire thing, booking to tour, was incredible. Lots of our scheduled wineries were closed the day of our tour due to the air quality but CWT was able to work around the obstacles that were thrown our direction so that we could enjoy the day. Our was also awesome and very professional with driving us around and putting up with us the entire day. Will definitely use them again for future tasting tours in wine country.<//Review>

I arranged a birthday wine tour for my wife's 60th along with my son and his wife! Stopped for a to go lunch at Oakville, and on to some great wine tasting stops. All done with the help of Jamie at CWT and our driver Aaron. We could not be happier! A great day all around and don't call anyone else!< /review>

<Review>Excellent recent experience with California Wine Tours. The vehicle was clean, sanitized, and comfortable. Was brief on all the covid measures they were taking which made our party of 4 feel safe. The driver wore a mask and was super friendly. If you're looking for luxury, private transpiration to get you around Sonoma and / or Napa, definitely go with California Wine Tours! Would 100% book again!< /Review>< Pictures>

A party of 3 adults, 1 baby, 2 dogs and tons of luggage was transported from SFO to Napa Valley at 2 am. Driver was courteous, kind and absolutely on time. Not a single complaint with the service and reasonably priced. Everything was terrific!<//Review>

<Text>We LOVED our experience with CWT. Booking was really easy, a quick phone call with Rich, and he was accommodating with our timeline and locations. Our driver Count was phenomenal. Really friendly, punctual, and very knowledgable about wine country. The limo itself was clean, stocked with glasses & champagne, and the sound system was perfect.<//Text>< gmapID>

CWT arranged a fantastic day at the Sonoma wineries for my group of 10 - easy to work with and reasonably priced! Full service including bus transport and scheduling of tastings at 3 wineries with 1 including lunch. The vehicle was brand new with a great sound system and driver was very professional. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the Napa / Sonoma area!< /review>

We used California wine tours for our trip to Napa and were absolutely blown away by the service. The front office was very responsive and professional. We originally had the trip scheduled in March and had to reschedule to October secondary to Covid. They worked with us so we didn't lose our deposit and helped us reschedule with no issue. The day of our tasting we had cancelations because of the fires and air quality but they helped us find and book new tastings at no extra charge. The driver was great, very professional and gave us smooth ride in a nice vehicle while keeping us on time. Gave us great recommendations for the next day as well. Can not recommend them enough!</Review>

It was very easy to schedule the trip and they took us to wonderful wineries that day.

<review>Hello...I'd like to take this opportunity to say "Thank You" for assigning Camera to our Tour on Monday May 13th. He was such a class act...making us feel as though we've known him our whole lives! He took time to visit about the wineries/areas we thought would be of interest...however, he made suggestions that enhanced this special first time visit to Wine Country ...making it even More Memorable! It makes me want to come back & do it all over again! You have a True Treasure in him!

From the moment I called seeking information on limos, to full communication up until our arrival date, your company was fantastic. Please feel free to use my review to assist you in allowing others to experience such a great  and fun way to see your beautiful countryside!

I recently planned an event for my company where we hosted a group of 20 for a 3 day trip to Napa.  I used CWT for all of my transportation, including pickup and drop off at SFO, Oracle Park for a Giants game, shuttles to dinners and a full day wine tour.  I had people flying in from many different cities and the logistics were not easy.  CWT was on top of all of it!  We were picked up on time, dropped off on time, and had great and friendly drivers!  I will be planning the same trip next year and will  be calling CWT to handle everything.  Can't say enough about the professionalism and customer service that I received from Jamie, Valerie and the whole team at CWT!<//Text>

Had a great experience with California Wine Tours! We booked a limo for a bachelorette party for 7 people. When the driver showed up, they had upgraded us to another vehicle because the one that we booked had broken AC (which we appreciated given it was a 100 degree day!). The driver was friendly, safe, and courteous. Would recommend to anyone!<//text>

<Review>Ramona Park is one of the best parks in the area with a good playground for toddlers and another for older kids. There are lots of benches and tables and most are underneath awnings for shade. It’s very quiet and secluded so you can often have the whole park to yourself.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Went in around 830 and the food was still super fresh! Love the freshness of the vegetables including the pickled onions and beats. The kind young associate assisting me was super gracious and welcoming, too! Thanks again for such favorable treatment during our first—and now certainly not last—visit. The soup and bottled sauce were really good as well! The baklava tasted wonderful to finish off the meal. Stellar.<//review>

A preferred location for quality mediterranean food. Service is prompt even when they are busy. The staff was very sociable and kind. The prices are good for what you get. Similar to a cafe in Las Vegas I loved.</text>

<Review>The food is tasty and filling for a good price. I love the bowls but you can also get wraps. They have vegan, veg and meat options so it can suit many diets. They give you a free lentil soup which is great. If I only want a small meal or something to feed my son, I order the soup and some pita. You order similarly to Chipotle (you go through a line and tell them what you want included). It has a very casual feel. Try it if you want a quick meal but want something better than burger fast food chains.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Best option for weekday lunches! Generous quantity of food, good proportion of veggies served at a reasonable price. All the dips & sauces - hummus, garlic spread, tzatziki, spicy tahini - are flavorful. The complementary lentil soup is delicious. During Covid times, they are maintaining good social distancing policies.< /Text>< pics>

< review>
Well I came because I was hungry and wanted me some healthy food. I looked at the yelp reviews and noted a bunch of stellar reviews except one so I decided to disregard that review and give them a go. I told the lady behind the counter that I had no idea what to order and to please give me some recommendations. She smiled and walked me through the menu items and gave me input on the items she liked best. After stuffing my bowl with Falafels, rice, beets, Cauliflower, red onions, something that looks like salsa, some kind of chicken and a bunch of other stuff “ included was also a small bowl of soup” I went to the condiment table and poured me some of their sauces, got me a table and ate.
Overall the food was really good except for the Falafels were on the dry hard side, the soup was amazing and the Cauliflower?? For-get-ah-bout-it! “I could have eaten a whole bowl of just that alone”
Overall the bowl and service gets a solid 4 stars “hell yes I’ll be back”</review>

You can still order inside. Markers on the floor to indicate appropriate standing distance, hand sanitizer available, and signs reminding customers to wear a mask. Food is just as delicious and fresh as before. Tried a pita this time and they're very generous with fillings. Garlic sauce and spicy cilantro are a must!

We had the DIY Meal for 4 (chicken shwarma) last night delivered to us and it was AWESOME! My wife and I were delighted with the meal. Reheating was simple and there was plenty of delicious food.

<text>We love this place and food. Price, portion and taste is good. The only reason I am giving a 3 star is because of annoying customer service I have been having since the last few days. I order from this place for pickup at least once/ twice a week since mid April and I get have been having trouble with partial order being kept ready for pickup. I had 3 consecutive times partial orders kept ready for pick. The Pita bread went missing - When I ordered 2 pita bread - I did not get any and when I ordered 3 Pitas as part of my order I  got only one. When I immediately called the restaurant, the guy who addressed the pickup order whose name is Carlos does not understand what I am saying (I do not know spanish either). He tells me he will call the manager in half english and half spanish,  when I know he was the only one in the store when I picked the order, and wastes 15 minutes keeping me hold until I finally hang up. I believe mistakes do happen and I am OK with them- but every single time now - may be not? The reason I order food is because we have a busy schedule - and out of the busy schedule - I need to keep following up on call for the partial order that was with no response. How annoying can it be when you are hungry and you have meeting in the next few minutes and your food order is partial prepared. The only reason I am sparing and was still ordering from this place is because - its 3 minutes walk for me to pick. Sorry, with the incident repeat again and again, you no more are going to see business from me.</text>< pics>

My teenage daughter who’s vegan loves this place until she got food poisoning and had to go to the ER. The owner was not apologizing but instead defended to the end that nothing was wrong. It was her graduation gift and she whent just before closing, being vegan she and her family knows were she ate, just make sure if a doctor says most likely food poisoning make sure it’s on paper before you seek damages<//Review>

Sajj is reliable and consistent.  Always a quick place to get food, and hundreds of different ways to combine their base, proteins, veggies, herbs, and sauces. A good example of what it looks like to Chipotle-ify a cuisine.</text>

SAJJ was clean and offered ample portions of your choice of condiments for the bowl I selected.  Flavor?  I give it 3 stars.  What is misleading however is the $ attached to the entry.  It should be $$ though in all fairness I am certain it is costly running a business in Cupertino.</text>

Delicious food, friendly staff, great prices, clean store, simple design.  I love Sajj! The food is amazing, served Chipotle style.  You won't end up waiting long at all.  I usually take advantage of the student meal. Which includes a discount, drink, and pita chips.  Even the sides are well thought out.  Regular meal comes with lentil soup.  Baklava is overpriced but still good.<//Text>

We love Sajj. Taking one star down because there’s one staff seems very reluctant to serve customers. (The other one is much better) Not sure if he’s having a bad day or something. It is Saturday 1pm 8/24 we experienced this.<//review>

<time>1550461853115</time><rating>4</rating><Review>Very good healthy option that is not over priced.  We decided to go here because we weren't that hungry but didn't want traditional fast food.  This place was perfect.  You could still come here if you were very hungry as well.  The garlic sauce here is very tasty.  I recommend it a lot.  Over all very good.  I had the chicken shwarma rice bowl and it was pretty good.  I took one star off because I ordered beef shwarma and they have me chicken... Not so big a deal as it was pretty good.  The only negative about it was there was a bit too much allspice in it for my taste.  It kinda of overwhelmed the taste a bit.  We will probably be back.  Decent place for a quick tasty meal!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Ordered online for pick up. My order was a rice bowl with chicken and falafel. I got a pita wrap with only falafel, no chicken. Food was good but maybe not worth the hassle. If I try it again, I would only order in person to make sure they don’t mess up again. I called them to let them know of the mess up, and they suggested I come back for them to fix it, or come back the next day for the same order. Not a good resolution in my opinion, as I did not want to waste another 30min of my day for dinner. Filling but frustrating.</text>

I love the made-to-order Mediterranean goodness they serve up here.  I usually go a bit overboard on the salty pickled add-ins but I'm always satisfied.  Get the Shawafel and you won't be disappointed.< /text>

<Review>Sajj is great for it's selection and flavors as well as the choice of "packaging". I love the chicken shawarma on mixed greens/arugula in a bowl, with cauliflower, onions, ots of hummus, and delicious mint. And you get awesome lentil soup too!
It's very tasty and fresh, and while it can be oily especially if you get eggplant, it's not too bad and I usually have enough for 2 meals in a bowl. And their green sauce is excellent. Give it a try!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This spot has become my go-to lunch place for meeting with friends (on weekdays). Food tastes fresh and space is sleek. Prices are reasonable too. Never need to wait in a long line. After lunch you can have coffee at Philz right next door or bubble tea across the street at KTea.</Review>

This is probably one of the worst of the Sajj locations, consistently providing less quantity, always out of soup, and terrible service. Will not be coming to this location again< /Review>

It's okay but doesn't compare well to Oren's or the falafel stop in Sunnyvale. Nothing is as fresh as you find at these other two restaurants. The meat is packed in the bottom of the pita and all the veggies at the top. This makes for a very inconsistent eating experience. The shwarma also seems like grade B low-quality chicken.</Text>

I really enjoyed my stop here at SAJJ. Mediterranean food is always a big hit and they will give you ample servings of each of the delectable courses in the entree.

I've stopped by several times and Marwan is always there to greet you. He is always made sure that my meal is made well and taken care of. I remember one time there was an issue with the pre-order and he went the extra mile to make sure the confusion was resolved. Thanks Marwan.< /review>

Here's how this place works: first, choose your base - salad, rice, pita or sajj bread. After that choose your meat or go vegetarian with falafel. Then, you can add various veggies. I highly recommend their eggplant which adds some great flavor. All the ingredients are super fresh and full of tasty flavors. This is real Mediterranean food. Their food isn't very salty but really relays on the flavors of the ingredients. The manager comes around and checks that everything is fine. They are really clean and friendly - what a nice experience. They also have outdoor seating.< /review>

Love the felafel bowls they serve here. Staff is super friendly and nice. One note - depending on what time you get there, you may be lucky and have arrived just when the felafel balls were cooked and get them fresh, or you may get unlucky and get slightly stale felafel balls that have been sitting there for some time.< /text>

Consistently tasty! One negative thing I found is that portion sizes vary greatly between the same kind of dish when I eat with a group.<//Review>

Explained best as a Middle Eastern food spin with great quality ingredients, on a Chipotle-like ordering system. Go down the line to add your ingredients and protein after you choose bowl or pita. Yum.<//Review>

Good fast lunch option. They have shawarma, falafels and you can get it Chipotle style as a salad, rice bowl, wrap or in a pita. Also includes free soup! But something is missing in the flavor.</review>

We adore Sajj (family meal, take out, pricing makes it so much easier to feed the whole family without breaking the bank)!<//Review>

Fast service. Chipotle concept for Mediterranean food. Halal meat, amazing sauces (love the spicy Tahini and garlic sauce). Tried the steak shawarma in a rice bowl. Very filling and you can customize your add-ons.
Served with lentil soup.
Had some of their mint lemonade and it was delicious!</review>

<review>Sajj is the Chipotle for Mediterranean food. It's quick service and you can get your food to go. You can do a wrap, pita sandwich, or bowl. I usually go with the chicken pomegranate or shawafel (choice of shawarma with falafels). It's quite a bit of food once they add in the toppings to the bowl. I've eaten the bowl for three meals before. Good value and good food, conveniently located in downtown Sunnyvale. There's some street parking or parking in the lot across the street.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I recently came across this new joint in Sunnyvale downtown. I went here more of an accident, but I am so glad that I stumbled upon this place. The people here so amicable and it feels really good to go here every time.

The joint is add what you like a Mediterranean bowl/wrap place. You pick your carbs, greens, protein, dressings and any extras toppings you might want to add, and there are a lot of toppings to chose from.

Their SHAWAFEL is a delight that everyone should definitely try out. All of their greens, toppings, and protein seem very fresh and really great treat for your taste buds. I have gotten freshly made falafels on a few occasions I have been here. They make falafels in small batches so that they can keep the freshness intact.

After any meal here, I would recommend anyone and everyone to have the Baklava on the side as a desert. It was just bliss.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The serving size is sufficient, the ingredients are quite fresh and the seasoning is just right, not too strong. The choices are very varied and you can customize your meal to your liking. The environment is also very clean and comfortable!

份量很足夠，食材相當新鮮而且調味恰到好處，不會太濃厚。選擇非常多樣，可以依喜好客製化自己的餐點。環境也非常整潔舒服！</Review><name>洪玨岑< /name>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Excellent attention from the staff, very friendly. And they managed to get my son to decide to eat there THANK YOU.
Shawarma chicken and beef are very, very tasty, they are not as greasy as in other places and they are not overly spicy.
I recommend ordering the chicken shawarma in pita bread, and they have that cucumber salad with olive oil that I love to stick to this.
The water is very sweet for me taste, I think they could leave it in half and still taste delicious.
Whenever you have little time, it is advisable to eat something healthy here.

(Original)
Excelente atención por parte del personal, muy amables. Y lograron que mi hijo decidiera llegar a comer ahí GRACIAS.
El pollo y la carne de res tipo shawarma están muy pero muy ricas, no están grasosas como en otros lugares y no están excesivamente condimentadas.
Recomiendo pedir el pollo shawarma en pan pita, y tienen esa ensalada de pepino con aceite de oliva que me encanta adherir a este.
El agua esta muy dulce para mí gusto, creo que podrían dejarlo a la mitad y aún así sabría deliciosa.
Siempre que tengas poco tiempo es recomendable pasar a comer aquí algo saludable.< /text>
