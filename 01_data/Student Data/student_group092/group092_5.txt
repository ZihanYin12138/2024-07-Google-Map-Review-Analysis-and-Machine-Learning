<Review>WOW!!
Let me tell you how great this place is to eat at. This is a family owned restaurant and you can tell! They’ve got mom in the back, pouring love into the food she’s serving up. I can’t even begin to put into words how great the food is here. Never have I had Ethiopian food, but I will come back, time and time again, just to eat some of mom’s food! Thank you again for the wonderful meal!

Try the combo platter!!!</Review><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x809ada4b520f6dd5:0xfe51bf7054168ff9</gmapID>< resp>

Was craving Ethiopian food and luckily we found this place nearby by searching. We were able to dine indoors and they were so friendly. We ordered the grand sampler which said it serves 2, but we hardly could finish half of it between the 2 of us! The food was great, it was a nice mix of stewed meats with lentils and other vegetables, served on top and with a side on injera. Highly recommend this place!<//Text>

<Review>I was in such a bad mood today until we came here for dinner!  Such a wonderful place!  Took my 90 year old Grandma here for Mother's day.  We had never had Ethiopian cuisine before so we were a little unsure what to expect.  It was amazing!  Family friendly, excellent service and delicious food! Loved the honey wine and I bought a bottle to go. Super excited to add this place on our family dinner rotation.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ada4b520f6dd5:0xfe51bf7054168ff9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Glad they’re back open for indoor dining. This place is a gem. Food is absolutely amazing and consistent every time. Service is always great. Love that it’s family owned. They are still operating with precautions to Covid, requiring masks upon entrance, being served & checkout. — Highly recommend!</Review>

<text>I like Abyssinia!  It isn't fine dining, it's a mom and pop shop.  Mom mostly runs it.  She is friendly and welcoming.

The food is delicious.  If you enjoy Ethiopian cuisine, this is the filling, satisfying family version.

Ethiopian dishes run from mild and flavorful to quite spicey and layered.  Abyssinia offers a grand sampler plate for two that will help the uninitiated experience the full spectrum.

If you're into family-run authentic cuisine, this restaurant should be on your list to try.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU0azKrQrGY9lC4p4paQKxrkJIYJnUajFSXZyy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIMxf603V_tVTuGyrYAx9N3bw3ekQLaSal2nuU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809ada4b520f6dd5:0xfe51bf7054168ff9</GmapID></record>

<review>Me and my wife have been dining here for a long time. And in the past 6 months a lot has change the lady owner is rude and disrespectful and discriminating me. I entered to order some food to go she was sitting there without a mask. As soon as I got in she stared at me with her rude eyes demanding me to wear a mask. I told her I have a medical reason and medical exemption to not wear a mask she wouldn’t want to listen at all. Than I kindly said may you take my order outside? She told me to leave. Unprofessional service would not recommend this place to anyone. After I called them saying can I order over the phone they hung up on me. This used to be a really nice place to eat. After Covid started their true personality popped out.< /review>< time>

< Review>
Exceptional Ethiopian cuisine served in an upbeat atmosphere by a friendly, hospitable family (a little niece had just woken up from her afternoon nap near the time we were departing!) Their combination of fragrant spices and flavors is unique in comparison with other food of this type I've eaten over the years. Injera bread is promptly brought to the table, and behind through counter is an ample selection of East African herbs, seasonings and other condiments to take away to our own kitchens, though duplicating any of this restaurant's excellent recipes is futile ---- all the more reason to come again often!</Review>

<text>I am a big fan of Ethiopian food and this place is the best in Sac and better than many places I have been to in the Bay Area. This is a family run restaurant and the owners are awesome. I visit this place once every couple of months and the food quality is consistent and service is great as well.

<review>I've been dying to try Ethiopian food for the longest and yuuup I finally made it. I must say I have mixed emotions about this place. On one hand the flavors were great whether it be from the chicken, beef or lentils. The spiciness was perfect to me as well. The downfall to my visit was how quick the food came out. My entree of choice for a friend and I was the meal for two which included various meats and lentil in sauces as well as greens. You would think cooking all of this elaborate food would take time to come out to our table but instead came out 5-7 minutes after ordering. I'm a huge fan of made to order food and I'm going to go out on a limb and state that they don't do this technique here. Nonetheless the food was very flavorful and I enjoyed the Ethiopian cuisine.<//review><rate>3<//rate>< Pics>

best damn Ethiopian food I've ever had in my life.

Some of the best food I've ever had.

Service was fast and excellent, the lady working was friendly, and extremely kind.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves flavorful, authentic traditional Ethiopian food.

Incredibly delicious. The drinks are bomb too.<//Text>

Most people look for all the bells and whistles but I look for the simple things Like the love and pride one puts into a meal, like your mother would do at home.  I love the  ambiance, the people who run it and the food was worth two trips in one day. The spices are still running through my taste buds after two hours of relaxing at home. If you like wine, start our with a glad of their honey wine.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809ada4b520f6dd5:0xfe51bf7054168ff9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This was my first time eating at this restaurant. The owner and son were very enlightening of the new design of the restaurant, He talked about his ancestor from Ethiopian. We talked about different dishes. The food and injera were delicious. The honey wine WOW still could taste the authentic root of the homemade taste from the honey wine. It was a wow experience. I will try another dish soon.</review><userid>108661885147648819702< /userid>< gmapID>

The food was soooo savory! I actually acquired wine as well as sauce to take house. The proprietors smile is so warm and also inviting as well as the food was remarkable!</Review>

1st time trying Ethiopian food. I got the vegetarian sampler that says it serves one, it was delicious and I could not finish it, which is rare for me. I tried my dates tilapia dish and it was awesome too.</review>

Didn't know anything about Ethiopian food. The food was wonderful. Slowly simmered stews with beef , chicken, lamb or fish (tilapia) in different sauces. I also enjoyed the collards.
My enjoyable surprise was being served family style , everything on one large platter, with the "utensils" being large crepe like bread to pick up the food.
Good friendly service, modest prices and good quantity.
Altogether an enjoyable experience to share with family or friends.< /review>

This is probably one of my favorite restaurants ever. I used to work near by and got weirdly obsessed with ethopian food while pregnant with my daughter. I've eaten at several ethopian places, both in Sacramento and in San Francisco and this one is the best.< /Review>

Very salty. Way too salty to eat. Recommended the restaurant employee/owner not to put too much salt and she was too rude to accept constructive critique.

It is really disappointing to be a monthly customer that supports this family members service and then be ignored when they do not prepare the food appropriately. I will take my company elsewhere where I'm not ignored and also just expected to consume food that doesn't come out the same every time.<//review>

I utilized to function near by as well as obtained weirdly obsessed with ethopian food while pregnant with my little girl. I've eaten at numerous ethopian areas, both in Sacramento and in San Francisco as well as this one is the finest. (Two adults and also 2 children) With plenty of leftovers for later on.</review>

This place was fantastic! I had their vegetarian lunch buffet ($8.50) and everything tasted just amazing. They had red, yellow, and green lentils, cabbage & potatoes, collard greens, and tofu that day. Plus the server working there was as sweet as could be.

Also, they had plates and silverware for those that prefer such things. I dug in with my fingers like always, though, because it's fun.<//Review>

I absolutely love this place! The food is fantastic. I would have given it 5 stars, but every time I go, the service is extremely friendly which is awesome, but it takes forever to get an order in and to get it out as well, and I'm not entirely sure if there are free refills but I doubt it since no one ever asks when my cup is empty.

But other than that, this place is great!</Review>

The best Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurant in the region - as good as the best places in Oakland. EXCELLENT service.

The vegetarian dishes are terrific - the spicier they are, the better, in my personal opinion. However, the meat is even better ... the rare dishes are terrific, and the sauces are rich and delicious.</text>

I have tried Ethiopian food a few times before and this is my new favorite place. I had the giant sample platter for two as well as some of the home brewed Ethiopian Honey Wine (they actually brew their own wine so I could not pass this up). The platter was big enough for two to have a fun and romantic dinner.

Plus the wine was absolutely sweet and delicious, it even still had yeast at the bottom of the bottle which is hallmark of it being a real homebrew item so that made my day!<//review>

The food was good and the staff was friendly and kind.  I'm not sure about the men's, but the women's bathroom needed a top to bottom cleaning. Sorry, but that knocked it down a star for me.< /Text>

Get the 2 person combo, you get so much food! Some things are intensly and uniquely  spiced and its nice to have the combo and be able to switch betwen the difernt exotic flavors. If you havent eaten ethiopian food before come with an empty stomach and open mind and someone to split the combo with.<//Review>

<text>I was looking for a graduation lei, and I was having trouble finding one locally. I came across Glendale Florist, and I saw online that they carried them. I called in to confirm the color that I wanted and to check availability for the very next day and they said it would be no problem. The lei came packaged beautifully, and looked fantastic. Very happy with my first experience, I will definitely be returning for any future flower needs.<//text>< rate>

<text>I called them before they even open and Art picked up and was very helpful in making sure that my order would be delivered before noon even though they were very backed up since it was Mother's Day weekend. I really appreciated his efforts, not to mention the arrangement was so much bigger and nicer (if you can believe it) than the one in the photo. The vase is one that is worth keeping. It's good quality and very pretty.Thank you Art!< /text>< Name>

...exceptional product and service offering. We ordered flowers over the phone from an out-of-state location. The Gendale Florist representative was very patient with our order request and delivered a beautiful arrangement for our party within a few hours! ...definitely on our list of go-to florists in the area if we need one in the future. Well done!< /Text>

First time using this florist.   The arrangement was spectacular; my girlfriend was thrilled; and the true test is that the arrangement looked even better in person than in the picture.  High 5 star rating.< /review>

<username>Thomas La<//username><text>One of the rare times the actual product was better than the online photo.  I ordered an arrangement for a friend’s birthday. When I received the BloomSnap after delivery, I was very doubtful that that was what had been delivered. The photo was just too professional-looking and the arrangement seemed to be better than what I thought I ordered. Still, I prayed that the final product would be at least half of what the BloomSnap showed.

When my friend sent me the photo of what she received, lo and behold, it was the exact arrangement pictured in the “professional-looking” photo!  I couldn’t believe it. It’s a shame I don’t actually live in California or else I would have found my new florist...< /text></record>

Glendale Florist is by far the BEST florist in Glendale.  They knock it out of the park every time I order from them - I actually have them as a personal contact.  The designers are extremely talented and collaborative.  They let you know via text when your order leaves their shop, and arrives at the final destination.  Amazing!!  Paul</Review>

This is an overdue review. One morning I was searching and searching for a flower shop in the Glendale area. Many said they were open, but they were not. As I continued looking through Yelp, I came across this treasured flower shop. I wanted to get my mom flowers just because. I wanted to surprise her and make her day. This place did just that! Surprised her and made her day.

I was not sure what to get my mom. However, the florist made the process so easy. She surprised me with a beautiful arrangement. I am so glad she has a keen eye for detail and knew exactly what a customer wants to gift to others.

I would highly recommend My Glendale Florist for any of your floral needs in the Glendale area.<//review>

<text>My Glendale Florist is the ONLY florist that I will use in my local area.  I wish I could send their flowers to my friends all around the country.  There is a special talent they have which make bouquets of flowers come to life.  What I also love is their attention to detail with the logistics/shipping of the products.  I get a picture of the bouquet when complete and then tracking to know when they are on the way and confirmation of drop off.  The customer service is exceptional.  Highly suggest!!< /text>< user_name>

In addition, I love the feature where they text you when they are ready to deliver and you can track the driver! There is no doubt when the recipient gets your delivery.

What you see and pay in the pictures, is what you get.  I am very happy with their delivery service as well.  They notify you step-by-step as soon as your flowers leave the store and reach the destination.  They pay attention at the notes put in and if necessary, they will call you if they do not have a particular vase or flower.  Good communication, excellent service and reasonable pricing.  I will highly recommend them.  Thank you!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>My mother just passed and I wanted to thank her friend for being such an amazing help. We ordered a beautiful bouquet and the delivery was exactly what was on the website. We felt like we got our money and then some. The recipient was so surprised and loved them. Plus, I could track with here the delivery was on its way to the location and who it was given to. I think I found my new florist! Thank you for making such a hard situation that much easier!<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

< Review>
I live in Australia and I've been using Glendale Florist to send flowers to my loved ones in the US for a couple of years now, as they do such a great job.
This time I had a problem trying to add an item to my order and used the online helpers at the florist to try and solve the problem.  I cannot over-emphasise the support they provided in trying to overcome the issue.  In fact after I gave up, they kept on trying and managed to rectify the problem whilst I slept.  The next morning, I decided to try again and lo - they had already added the item to my order.
The staff are incredibly helpful and professional and I give the establishment five gold stars for their service, not to mention the beautiful flower arrangements they deliver.
Best ever.< /Review>

I LOVE My Glendale Florist! I’ve been ordering all my flowers from here for the past 3 years and they have never failed me. The arrangement always comes out more beautiful than the picture and the customer service and delivery is always perfectly on point. I would give them 5000 stars if I could!<//text>

Glendale Florist exceeded my expectations- while ordering an arrangement for my grandmother's funeral, they called to make sure they had all the information they needed to coordinate with the funeral home and texted when it was delivered. When we arrived, I was floored by how beautiful the arrangement was- it was even better than the picture. They added other blooms that were beautiful (and this was with the standard order, not deluxe). My mom, who wasn't keen on getting flowers in the first place, was so thankful that we did. She loved them and thought the arrangement was the perfect way to show our love for such an amazing woman in our lives. I also loved that they include a personalized banner with the arrangement, something that a lot of florist, especially online orders, don't include. I highly recommend Glendale Florist, and will be coming back to them when I need flowers for any occasion.</Text>

<text>Best family-owned flower shop in Glendale, bar none. Have gotten Mother's Day and Valentines Day flowers for the two most important women in my life there,  will continue to do so because they make me look good. Art, the owner, bends over backward to make your arrangements a work of art. If you need to make a quick stop to pick up a bouquet or need something in a few weeks, they're the people you need to see. I can't stress enough how wonderful these people are. 10 stars!!! 🌟</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1559868671722, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words.

It was by chance that I ordered this bouquet for my daughter who lives in California.  I live in Plymouth, Massachusetts and wanted to send her flowers for her birthday.  I went online and read the reviews for Glendale Florist.  I can tell you that they did not disappoint.  I received an email through the delivery process stating where the flowers were and when they were delivered.  Needless to say...the flowers were beautiful!!  Glendale Florist is my go to in the future.  :)</Text>

Where to begin with this flower shop? I absolutely love these guys. I have come to them before for mothers day, valentines day, birthday flowers, and even my wedding flowers. I love their style. I love there customer service. I trust Rose to come up with a floral arrangement for me anytime I need one. She works with my budget and I always like leaving her an extra tip for her hard work. Oh, I forgot to mention they also deliver to all of Los Angeles? How convenient is that?!?! By far the best flower shop in all of Los Angeles!</Text>

I ordered the Vanda Orchid and Lisianthus Special from Glendale Florist for my fiancée's birthday.

Having them delivered to her work, I was nervous they wouldn't get delivered properly (I didn't have good luck in the past with 1-800-FLOWERS).

They sent me a text when it was out for delivery (saying it'd be delivered in about 23 minutes) and one saying it'd been delivered shortly after my fiancée texted saying how beautiful the flowers were.

I'm glad I found BloomNation and Glendale Florist.  This was a very good experience and has definitely earned me some brownie points!</text>

They are so great! I called in a last minute request and with in an hour I had a gorgeous bouquet of flowers!  "My Glendale Florist" is now our company's official go to florist.

Thank you for making such beautiful arrangements and being so accommodating!

Here's why these guys rule:  I ordered flowers for my wife in the afternoon. Already a late start. The flowers I wanted were out of season, but they had some available at another store, so they got a speedy pick-up and got them for me.

Then, the address I told them to go to was an old, out of date address. Time was getting on and it looked like they were going to have to delay the order a day or two. Damn. BUT NO. They didn't give up. They found the right address on their own and got it delivered anyways. It was a lot further, too.

Not only did they deliver it in time, but they didn't charge me for the extra effort. Also, they ran out of small vases, so they gave me a full size arrangement! Now THAT's uncommon service. My wife got her flowers and all her co-workers were impressed, and the girls were jealous... Ok, so I made up the jealous part, but she got compliments.

Highly recommend these guys.</review>

<text>I order flowers for my wife to get deliver to her work place unfortunately got delivered to billing address and who ever was the person replying to email didn't want to keep his client happy to deliver to right place.

I've been searching for the best flower shop in Los Angeles for a while and after countless mishaps with other florists I finally found the perfect spot. My Glendale florist is always consistent, affordable, and most importantly creates the most beautiful flower arrangements.<//text>

This is my go to Barber. Plenty of chairs never have to wait long. They do a good job and if first responders show up there to get their haircut then that speaks volumes.< /Review>

<Text>Great experience and great haircut for a good price. My barber took his time to look at my photo examples and really understand the haircut I wanted. Parted my hair and had me confirm where I wanted the part and undercut.
He then took his time to get the sides and fade smooth. I really appreciate this because other barbers for the same price rush through.
My man earned his tip.
This is my spot now.
I will be back.< /Text>< UserId.>

Quick service, reasonable price, nice haircut. That's what I look for in a barber shop and this place has what I like. Nice and lively inside, and a good organized cueing system with numbers tickets to keep track of who got in line when. Another bonus is they seem to do well with kids!< /Review>

Very comfortable shop with  fast service  , a great price, and friendly  experienced barbers/stylists.
My dad was a barber in the 40’s and cut my hair into my teens. My wife’s mom owned a salon. I highly recommend this shop. I’ve cut my own hair the past 15+ years and now I’ll go here...much easier and better .</Text>

I sat down there were 10 guys waiting and 6 in chairs getting chopped. Didn't need to wait to long and received a very good cut.  Price is very reasonable,  and they have nice big TV's with sports on.
Cash only buy they do have an ATM in house.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2dee38463ad7:0x27f35df5a330ed52< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Don't want to talk? Don't have to talk. Want to use your phone while your hair gets cut? There's clear plastic on the smocks. Don't know how to describe the haircut you want? There's a wall of styles all numbered for ease. You walk in, take a number, and you get your haircut.

These cutters do an icy cold fade. Friendly and will remember your cut. I have tried 4 different cutters and they all did great. But I do have my favorite. She knows who she is. Very kid friendly and they have sports on big screen so you can watch the game when junior is on the chair. 😎 I'll take em honey no problem 🤣🤣🤣<//text>

I've been getting my hair cut here for almost two years. All the barbers are good. I'm not picky so I've let them all cut my hair and have never been disappointed. Most guys coming in for stylish fade haircut wait for one of the male barbers. I would recommend this barber shop for anyone looking for a easy an affordable hair cut.< /review>

This place maybe good for cuts, no really for beards.
I always done my beard myself and decided to take a plunge and get it done by a barber (first time going to a barber to get my beard done).  I came in and a female barber called my name.  I explained I wanted to get a classic beard style look.  I don't think she understood what I was saying it, and she kept asking, with a  heavy accent, 'if I wanted trimmed at #1.'  The owner came over, and I said it was my first time and would like some suggestions.  He said  he didn't have any, and that I needed to know what I wanted.  Had to leave, without getting my beard done.  Sad cause I had read good reviews about this place.< /review>

Their faded are universal, whether you want a low mid taper high you name it, theyll do the same thing in the end. Which is this very high circular fade up towards the top of your head using machine not scissors towards the top. Im usually getting haircuts from my barber in LA but decided id stop by here since im in town and im running but goodness me. This barbershop was terrible at fading, as i sat there i seen multiple people getting the same exact disgusting fade. The fact that everybody in the reviews praised this barber shop makes me feel sad for all the people who are walking around this city with dead rats on their head. Lesson learned, sticking to my barber< /review>< response>

Went in to get my haircut today. Lady laughed at me when I asked for a #1 1/2 on the sides faded up to a #8 on top. I always use these attachments on my clippers when I cut my hair at home or get my haircut at The Barber Pole. She claimed my hair was too short and it wouldn’t cut any hair. Funny...cause my last haircut was 2 weeks ago with the same attachments. So I was looking to just trim it up. She was adamant that I was wrong without even trying to cut my hair. So I got up and left. If they won’t cut people’s hair let the customers request, why on earth would I trust them to cut my hair. I only have 2 stars because they do an average job on my boys.
If you go...the man who cuts hair in the first chair when you walk in is the best. Don’t settle for anyone else.</text>

Friendly service. Way cheaper than most other. Way more bang for your buck. For $27 got a fade and a hot towel shave with straight blade. Location seems to cater to an older crowd but don't let that deter you.< /Text>

Finally found a spot where imI in and out in a timely manner, clean fades at a very reasonable price.  A Barber Shop where ever chair is actually being used imagine that.  It's not your new generation social barber of 19 yr olds trying to do fades and 2 chairs being used.< /review>

<Review>Finally a shop that listens to the consumer and delivers. Third barber in this location after several failed attempts. When your sign says barber shop and all you do is use clippers...and you can't deliver what the consumer wants...you're not a barber! On my first visit here I showed sunny what I wanted, after he was finished I felt as if he had been cutting my hair for years. I'll be coming here for years now. Thanks sunny!!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
First time there. Son needed a haircut. Guy was Very friendly. I showed him a picture of how i wanted it to look like. He said no problem. My son was comfortable throughout the whole haircut. Once he was done his head looked amazing. Only 13$$$ i gave a tip and thanked him. Will definately be going there again.<//Review>

I come up to realize they cut him and blamed me for not telling them he had a mole on the side of his head! I had to walk up to see what's wrong and then yelled at for not telling them. I dont know about coming back. Seems friendly until "you" mess up.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>104579815051314163240</userid></record>

I've been coming here for years and have always had good experiences. Until one day a Asian lady that works here who speaks hardly any English messed up my hair. She totally did the opposite of what I told her to do. I said to keep my hair longer in the front and she made the front literally the shortest part. I told her three times very clear how I wanted it because I could tell her English was poor. Still completely messed it up. I don't know what I'm going to do now my hair is so messed up.<//text>

<Review>Best Mechanic shop in town go see Sam he and his team are the best and honest mechanics you will ever meet! I had to inspect getting a new serpentine by and they recommended a few ideas and we ended up changing the belt to a brand new one and my noise problem on my 2011 Suzuki Sedan went away. Was holding off on buying a new car for at least 1 more year and Sam made sure that everything in my car was fine to drive. I came here a few times in the past and got recommended from a tow truck driver to see these guys instead of Firestone, top grade quality mechanics you will not find anyone better around the city! Thank you 360 for all your help< /Review><user_name>David Garcia<//user_name>< date>

<review>I went to them about my jaguar. Due to me having someone else work on it. They gave me the most honest answer. They said due to the fact you had someone else work on it  we can not go over another mechanic works. I knew then that is the shop I will deal with. Because they chose honesty over money. That honor that is pride in my opinion that is the shop for me my  new Antioch California family  since my relocation from Frisco. This is keeping  it 💯✌# T.Lowe from RBL posse.</review>< Rating>

Sam, who runs this place with his brother, is generous with his time -- didn't make my husband and me feel rushed when we called him (more than once) to ask his advice. And he gladly diagnosed the problem gratis -- that's way more than the vast majority of shops will do. Competent, honest  -- 360 Auto knows how to build a loyal customer base.</text>

I’ve been coming to 360 Auto since I moved here 5 years ago and I will not go anywhere else for my auto repair needs. Sam and his staff are not only friendly and professional they are honest and will not overcharge for services. As a woman, I am wary about taking my car to be serviced as I have been overcharged or had things done to my car that were not needed. But Sam has always told me what needed to be done and the most cost effective way to do it and what could wait until l I could afford it. He also recommend us to a great car dealer who got us an amazing deal on a new car! They are just good people all around! Good and timely service! If you want honest and affordable car service, please come here! Thank you 360 Auto!<//text>

I hate auto mechanics! 99.99% of auto mechanics are crooks! Because of 360 Auto Care Inc's excellent high ratings on Google and Yelp, I went to see them a year after seeing their extraordinary reviews online. These gentlemen and their staff are truly professionals. They did such excellent work, at half the cost of any dealership shop, that I am going to recommend them to all of my family, acquaintances and friends. They are absolutely the best!!!< /review>

This is one place that is fast, honest and the prices  are very reasonable without no hidden fees. They are very  professional.  I remember the very first time i walked in the door I was treated with respect and not ignored because I am a female and it is like that every time I walk in there.  Sam has always let me know what was wrong with my car and done the work in a timely fashion without overcharging.  If your looking for a Honest, Reliable, Efficient and Reasonably price then this is the place to take your car.  Thank you Sam and your crew for the Excellent  work and taking good care of my  car.  360 has been the only place I will take my car to because i know my car is in good hands and I can trust  the workers with my car.  I am a lifelong customer and do recommend them as the most honest auto shop I have ever entrusted all my cars to.  They have my business for life.  Thank you again 360 for your  honesty and hard work :)<//review>< resp>

Extremly Solid customer service. I was sitting in the waiting area while my car's oil was being changed when I overheard one of the mechanics tell  a customer that they did not have to get some work done on their transmission since it looked very clean already. The customer was told it would be a waste of money to do it. Honesty goes a long way in the world. This repair shop has gained myself as a repeat customer.</Review>

Speed, Quality and satisfaction - That best explains how they do business. I've been coming here for last 10 years and never had an issue. The owner, Sam and his team works diligently with every customer with integrity and gets the job the the first time. I would rate 10 stars if that was an option.< /text>

I'm a huge supporter of small or local businesses as it is a rare commodity to find one ran so well in comparison to the big corporations/competition all over the place. I live right across the street from Walmart and it would be easier to take my car there, however you can never get the type of genuine customer care that the staff of 360 Auto delivers. And they deliver every time!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Rating>5< /Rating>< Response>

Sam took care of my pops truck, was straight up about the charges and work.  Got it done quick too!  Best part was he didn't recommend any additional work just to get the price up.< /review>

Seem to be 360, but doesn't fix everything. My car had a problem, I was given a high cost, and then told that I would have to come back another time to get it fixed, because they were busy, leaving me with no car for a week until I decided to take it somewhere else, with the price being 40% lower.<//text>

First and foremost, honesty and reliability is what I'd describe this shop and crew. Never been here but have passed it numerous times and 2 short stories.

1. Had to get my car smog, but wouldn't pass cause a few months before that my car battery died and had to jump start which resetted the CPU, took a month and a half which I tried every other week to see if it would pass, they didn't charge me extra as long as I had the receipt. Even Sam remembered me which I was surprise as to how many people come there and it's my first time.

2. This is recently but I needed to get my oil change and I needed an estimate for my broken AC. A few years ago I used to take it to Honda for oil change and outta no where they just told me and showed me an estimate of how a tiny pebble was sucked into my vent and that's why my AC wouldn't work. I was skeptical because they're charging me 800+...luckily I don't drive my car too much as I have another so it wasn't a necessity and I even went to another shop by Costco, same bs story. I saved over 600+ with Sam and his team as there was no leaks or anything it just needed freon.

I'll be moving soon but if I'm ever in town or knock on wood something happens I'll be sure to take it to 360 auto shop. Thanks Sam as well as your crew< /Text>

< Review>
This small coffee shop in a very quite town has not only amazing coffees and drinks but flawless customer service.
The Smores coffee is of the best I've had. Their Maverick energy drink tastes amazing. If you're driving through Lemoore, this place is worth stopping at!
I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

If you’re not into supporting small and local businesses in your community, that are owned and managed by people like your next door neighbor, then go somewhere else. The hospitality here is greater than that of the more, big company/corporate owned coffee shops.< /review>< Resp>

You can get in and out in a pretty consistent pace each time you go.  Call ahead or order at the counter,  the staff is friendly, the coffee is fresh, the service is great.  Big name chains have nothing on Maverick's Coffee!<//Text>

<text>I visit this place at least once a week. Owner is really nice and goes above and beyond to accommodate his customers. Mocha is amazing and has become my personal favorite I dont like when the chocolate overpowers the coffee taste and they seemed to got it down perfectly. My husband enjoys the vanilla caramel. Definitely will pick this place over starbucks and all other local coffee places anyday.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
I love this place, as a former long-term employee(5-10-18 to 5/2019 (I think the year's are right)) I can honestly say that William is a very loving and compassionate man, he's family oriented and is very positive, even when things are stressful and difficult, he keeps a smile on his face and gets what needs to be done, done. He was an amazing person to work for/with, he taught me a lot and gave me a chance to work at Rooster Wheels when I was homeless living in a van with my girlfriend at the time and our two dogs which William loved too, Breezy he says is a bunny, he really did more then a boss/coworker would ever have in any other situation, he became a really close friend of mine over the year I had been working there until my girlfriend broke up with me and I left, and quit working there, we still keep in touch from here and there, I hope this review helps some people understand that this place is simply amazing in every aspect thanks to William and his strength and will to be able to do what he does.< /Review>

<review>Amazing experience here. I brought my family of 6 in to rent bikes for the day. William took the time to outfit each of my kids (ages 4-12) with a bike that they liked. My wife and I both got cruisers.

The beach bike trail was right across the street, so we left our car there and spent the afternoon riding along the coast. Everyone had a great time.

When we returned, I liked my rental so much, that I asked William if I could buy it. He gave me a good price and  replaced the grips. I couldn't be happier with our experience there. I would recommend Rooster Wheels to anyone; large-familied or not!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe7gxHQd6CK6um1osm0f2oAzdh-cI7wt06L0kl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808dfcd1429e03b5:0xfcaf6b33dc54852c<//GmapID></record>

<Review>If your are looking for a bike shop in the Monterey Bay area Roosters should be your only stop. William and his crew are the most knowledgeable and professional in the business. They do not look down or shorthand anyone that comes into the shop. Every time I come in I know that I will be getting personal service that you cannot get anywhere else, no matter what they have him the extra mile to help me and I am sure they will do the same for anyone else. 10/10<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1611555954472, 'text': 'Thank you Peter, without our Good customers, we would be nothing.'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808dfcd1429e03b5:0xfcaf6b33dc54852c<//Gmap_id></record>

Great place to rent a bike for Ford Ord or the rec trail, if you are in town. William put a lot of effort into getting a mountain bike ready for my friend visiting from Europe. Great experience.<//review>

< Review>
Not a bad shop at all. Repairs are solid and the price is decent but turn around time is pretty long. I have had repairs done 3 times now at this shop and it has been over two week each time. In addition, I called to check on the status of the repairs each time the bike was in the shop and told I would be called back which I wasn't.

On the plus side, the owner of the shop is extremely nice and knowledgable.

Overall, if you don't need your bike for a few weeks, this is the shop for repairs and service done at a good price. If you want a quick turn around time, I would go elsewhere.< /Review>

I really have enjoyed my experience working with this shop. I have traded a bunch of my old cycling equipment for bikes that are more appropriate for my current riding needs. They are relaxed, knowledgeable, and have a wide variety of new and used equipment to choose from. Ride on!</text>

I took my bike here for repair on 1/20/20 it is now july and the owner William cannot find my bike. They actually offered me a different bike! This place is a rats nest of disorganization and clutter.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this bicycle chop shop.  Police Report Made. Its too bad there isnt a negative star rating.< /Text>

The day I brought my bike to his shop, I called a few times each time he told me it could be done the next day. Almost two weeks later I called and he was kinda rude to me and told me he would call me when it was done. I waited another day and just drove up there. To his defense hes really busy. I would just like from the start to for him to say it may take two weeks or more instead being put on hold and given the run around. If you don't mind your bike being in the shop for 2 weeks plus this is the for you. If your in a hurry I don't suggest this shop.</text>

William the owner is someone you would like to have your children grow up to be like him. Honest, friendly, hardworking, and fun to know! We arrive at the store and he came out of the store to ask if we needed help as I exited my vehicle. He removed my rear bike tire, checked for leaks, replace a tube, sold me a air pump, and of course with a great price. He offer information on local trails and his phone number if I need help on the bike or off. Wow - he got my business and future loyalty.< /Review>

A fantastic local bike shop. Everyone I've spoken with there has been super nice and patient and welcoming. It's exactly the environment you want in a local shop. Nice, chatty and patient people who love bikes and love to share that love. Marina is such a great town.

Anyways, I took my bike in for a tune up, and it has never rode better than after the tune. Took only one day!  It was also quite a bit less expensive than I expected, but I think my expectations were high. Regardless, the price is very fair. I would definitely trust any bike to this shop  - good people, great service. I almost want to have more work done just to hang out at the shop!< /review>

This was a phenomenal place to rent bikes for the day! William spent time making sure each bike was right for each person, and the cost was very reasonable. He provided helmets, locks, and all of the accessories that made for a great day of biking as part of the rental.</Text>

<text>Wow, where to begin? The owner, William, took exceptional care of me and my wife with rental bikes. He went out of his way when we showed up to custom fit some road bikes to us, even switching out pedals and a bikes to us, even switching out pedals and a stem! I would highly recommend rooster Wheels to anyone in the area, not only for rental bikes but also sales and service!</text><Name>Scott Campen< /Name><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Bicycke tourist!! Go here!! This place rocks. I actually went in just to ask for a tad bit of advise and see if I could make an exchange for some stuff I bought at REI. They were willing to look into a trade of sorts. Everybody was super nice and helpful. They tried to give me some free apples and were down for a short chat. I wish this place was my local bike shop! Even willing to install some parts for me. This place looks like it runs of passion and not money alone.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I took my bike in for a taco'ed rim and some derailleur problems.  When I came to retrieve it, it wasn't ready yet.  I had been told it would be done and I was ready and dressed for a ride.  The owner lent me a brand-new Intense Primer for my ride, at no charge!  When I returned, my bike was finished, and it only cost me $100 (for a used rim install, new derailleur hanger and jockey wheel).  Great place!<//Text>

<text>I rarely write positive reviews because quite frankly it’s seldom that I’m wowed by a customer service experience.  I needed the front break on my bike fixed and both of my tires were worn so I actually considered buying a new bike.  Instead I took my bike to Rooster Wheels in Marina with the goal of just getting the break fixed. The proprietor (William) was super friendly and indicated he could fix the break on the spot. He commented on the tires and I elected to leave the bike there for him to install new ones (tubes and tires). Less than 2 hours later he calls and tells me my bike is ready.  A break fixed, two new tires, prompt and friendly service -- $25. Wow, what a bargain!<//text><Time>1503792332539</Time>< userid>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My first time visiting Redondo beach..July 03 2020
My daughters spot the mangoneadas special for $6.99.. I wasn't sure at the beginning because i though it was going to be made out of artificial flavor for the price it was selling?
After i seen my daughters telling me dad this mangoneadas are really good it is all natural fruits...you should get one it is better then the ones they sale at the Michoacana ice cream places..
After tasting it i can said it is
The best mangoneadas i ever taste #1
Now the Michoacana mangoneadas are #2 on my list..
El cinco de mayo in Redondo beach will be my next visit in the future to buy mangoneadas and to try mexican food as well.< /review>< pictures>

<review>AMAZING! I’m
So upset we decided to stop here on our last day in this area. We ordered a combo which came with 4 quesatacos, 1 burritos, 1 quesadillas and homemade chips tortilla. And we ordered  4 quuesatacos de Birria which came to about 70 bucks including bottled drinks feeding 4 ppl (two adult, two children). These are theeee most authentic tacos I’ve had since Mexico I’m very happy to give El Cinco De Mayo 5 stars if I could give them more I would!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The first time we came I had a mojarra (fried fish) but my husband kept going on and on about his quesadilla. So the second time we visited I definitely had to get one and they didnt disappoint. It is a bit pricey for Mexican food tho, they is my only negative. But I guess being on the boardwalk, you need to charge more.</review><Time>1600102000601</Time>< Response>

There on a Monday mid afternoon, not many people anywhere.  Looked a little sketchy and was worried.  But whoa, you cannot judge a book by its cover.  This food was awesome.  Deliciously done and just so tasty.  Had shrimp tacos, my wife had a mulita with chicken and kids had asado fries.   So good!!!!!!<//Review>

Great food. You need to try the Mulitas. It is like a cross between a burrito and a quesadilla.

The food is very reasonably priced an exceptional value considering it is served on a pier.</review>

Gone to this bar in all sorts of gear many times. Fun place. Been a few months (pre-pandemic) so can't vouch for it currently. They did have a great selection of alcohol.<//text>

<text>Been to Pecs a few (4-5) times, most recently on June 24th. The bartenders are pretty friendly!, but I find most of the patrons are not. Maybe it's because the majority attend more frequently than I do. Prices are good and drinks are pretty strong. Overall, it's a good bar to try out.

<Text>Oh yeah! When the bartender understands you perfectly, it's so nice! I was there and I was in a lousy mood, so this bartender guy helped me forget all the problems. It’s cool when strangers and strangers can speak kindly to you like that. As if talking to a friend. but he was in this place for the first time. If you need bears, then you have come to the address. And you will become very obedient boys. Here are promotions you can get free drinks and a private room for an hour. To do this, I had to register on 909gay,com to create a profile, and show the administrator. It has been so pleasant for me for a long time.</Text>< Pics>

We love this bar! The happy hours are awesome! The bartenders are always nice to us. The drinks are stiff, so be ready to get your drink on.</review>

<Text>Great bar in San Diego to hang out with friends. They provide a jukebox, the beer is cold and the bartenders are friendly and easy to order from. The pool table(s) will allow you to kill some time, restrooms are clean and its on University Drive. Good corner location.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80d954ef3b072db5:0xc296fdf0d3995e86</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

One off the bartenders said (under his breath), “great, another foreigner,” when I said excuse me, he said “you immigrants don’t know how tip and told me “you people aren’t welcome here” and told me to leave!< /Text>

He would not let me in, it is 12/16/2017 11:55pm. 01/01/2018 1:38pm I came outside to look for my friend who came outside to smoke, the same bar security guard who tried to 86 me would not let me in. I had ordered a corsair on the rocks and explained to him that I wanted to finish drink but refused to let me in. This elderly security guard is purposely attacking me and harassing me, every chance that he gets he will purposely keep me out of the bar. It's so sad and pathetic, the owner needs to know about this so I will report it to the BBB and make sure that every one knows about this ludicrous behavior.</review></record></dataset><record>

After several visits, noticable the unfriendly bartenders. Lots of attitude, and comments between them...
Often get the feeling your putting them

The staff were friendly and easy going.

Food tasted fresh and staff was friendly.  They had no ranch but it didn't stop me from having 1 1/2 bacon cheeseburger.< /review>

I like Five Guys, but lately things are slipping at this location...  we ordered 4 burgers, and two had toppings that were mixed-up, luckily no one had allergies, but it was annoying.  And the volume of fries seems to be reducing, not like at other locations where you get that extra bit in the bag, just the filled cups.  Maybe this is a local policy change, but you get used to getting extra...  maybe that sounds entitled, sorry....  but that's just me.< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Good place for your basic burger and fries.
Don't buy the large fries, the small fries are enough for two people.
I just wish the hamburger buns were bigger and better tasting.
Comsistant chain, so you know what to expect.
I would rate 5 guys just behind Habit Burger.</review><userid>116401651905752488953< /userid><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>4< /rate><gmap_id>0x80900aca77b21075:0xfce09a12dfba56c2</gmap_id>< Time>

<review>Aamazing! I had never had Five Guys before. I was very skeptical though. Nations was such a disappointment that I avoided this place. I finally took the risk. Worth every penny! It was almost as good as if I had made them myself.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>Rude workers. Cold food. Didn't make shake in time. Then made a bunch for a customer that came in after us and didn't make ours till much later. Lied about why and what happened. Kept repeating to everyone they were understaffed. Had 4 workers there and no line. 9 people inside eating. Lazy. I've been there with 12 in line and all seats inside filled and only 3 workers and all good. Second time we had bad service at this one.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Expensive disgusting burger, burnt fries, nasty sodas like they dont clean the soda machine, the fries are literally burnt. I was excited to try it for the first time and it was decidedly the worst experience I've had at any restaurant/fast food place. And I'm usually very patient and I'm not picky with food. I got to customize my own cheeseburger and I couldn't taste anything but mayonnaise.<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>We stopped at this Five Guys after getting Costco has and driving down the 99 Fwy. Not bad, but pretty pricey. We got two burgers and a hot dog: $33.50. The burgers were good (In 'n' Out is better) and the dog was so-so. The fries were good though. Save your money and go to the competition.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great tasting burgers and fries. Prices are high for a burger. A little burger is a single patty, a double is just a burger. Peanuts are free to enjoy while you wait. Shakes are good and the fountain drinks have an insane combination possibility. If you haven't been here you need to try it at least once.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I'm not really a burger person but I LOVE Five Guys!!! I love all the options you get in picking out how to get your is made. There are fully shelled peanuts to be had while waiting (bonus!!!) and their soda fountain is one of the fancy ones that has like every kind and lets you add a variety of flavors. The fries are good and my burger is always super juicy and delicious!< /Text>

We had a great time here as we usually do. Our waitress was very pleasant. I didn't catch her name but she was medium built, black, with natural hair; This past Sunday, she made my time with my step-daughter great here. I love their food! Keep the tortilla soup on the menu.< /text>

Burgers are not worth the almost $20 dollars that they charge for a simple burger and fries and they don't even include a drink, you have to buy it separately<//Text>

4 stars instead of 5 because, while the burgers and fries are great (5 stars), the prices are outrageous (3 stars). My wife and I each had a SMALL cheeseburger and water to drink. I had a regular order of fries and she had a regular milk shake. This modest meal set us back $30!! It may look like a casual diner, but be prepared to pay much more.<//text>

Great food...I really love the Cajun fries. The staff here is always friendly and fast. I usually order online and if I walk in early they give me my drink and get my order to me as fast as possible. The service here is really good and the food is even better! Always a favorite stop for me.</review>

Customer service was top notch, but I’m not a fan of their burgers, fries were good but not 5/5 fries. If I could pay for a place to only get served well then this would be the place to go. Again, nice people</Text>

<Text>Everything is individually priced. So if you want a custom made burger meal this is the place. However, the meat is decent but the buns seem like the cheap Rainbow buns you'd have for a bbq in the backyard. So that burger, fries, and a small coke sets you back $18 (for one person) and it's really not worth the cost. For that price ypu could eat at Lodi Beer Company and have a nice burger on a brioche bun and quality meat. I tried this place 2x, I won't be back.</Text>< resp>

Best tasting burger I have ever eaten in a fast food restaurant. Lots of toppings like grilled onions or peppers. Some of the tastiest French fries as well. Very generous helping for their fries. A regular size is enough for our family of 6.</text>

So much better then 4 guys. Burgers are juicy. Fries are plenty. They have some good ingredients. My only issue is that I wish the buns held together better. The deliciousness tends to fall apart. 😥</Review>

Good place but a little pricey. This is a great alternative if one doesn't want to get a burger from the other burger places in town. Its meat between bread so the variety shouldn't cause anyone to be paralyzed by indecisiveness, but I don't know you (no judgment here tho). The milkshakes are good, but like the burgers, they won't push your culinary boundaries. Fresh ingredients though.</Text>

Burgers are bomb,  fried are alright and the veggie sandwich was really messy and had too many mushrooms. But the staff was great and the good was out super quick. Will definitely go back.</review>

Really good food and good service too but like everyone else they raised their prices when minimum wage went up... They were already maxed out on their prices to begin with, now they are too expressive.</review>

My first and only experience at this location was horrible. The price wasn't worth it.

The rudeness from the manager wasn't worth it. Asking for my order to go was apparently enough for the manager to give me a sarcastic grin and say "sure".

There we're orher things that occurred, that was slightly concerning but I am writing a nice email to their corporate office about.

I will NOT be returning here. I used to go to Five Guys a lot when I lived in Ohio and NEVER had this kind of experience.</Review>

They've got little boats for the peanuts now. Or maybe they just didn't have them when I last visited a year ago. The facility was clean throughout, and the staff were polite. And despite me spending over 30 mins there even after finishing my food, nobody called the cops on me.
The "all the way" hamburger I had was pretty stellar. Every bite had all the fixin's, and made good use of the foil wrapper it came in. It was a juicy and tall stack of patties on a great bun. It was however, surprisingly pricey, despite how good it was.
~$8 isn't unheard of for a good burger, but it isn't my go-to for the foundation of an economic meal. Still, if I'm ever in the area again and want a burger that will leave a lasting impression on my taste buds, I will definitely be returning.< /Review>

I normally love 5 guys but today there was a little red in the burger and I  ended up throwing it away. Food safety issue and for that I have to give a 1 star. No I didn't complain, i just didn't feel like dealing with it today.< /Review>

<text>Service was fast considering the number of customers in the store, but the food was sub par based on previous visits compared to today. The hamburgers were a little chilled by the time we got home which was about 5 minutes away and the hot dog was really cold! Also some of the fries were slightly burnt and did not have very much seasoning.<//text><user>110054273410359135747</user>< GmapID>

<Text>Rather okay. $31 seems rather pricey for just two people. The burger and fries were okay. The shake was okay. Everything was just okay but, I was expecting more then just okay for that price. Both workers seemed very disinterested but, that's probably because they were working on New Year's Eve</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Burgers are great if you like them well-done (overcooked imo) and fries are hit and miss but when they are good, they are the best. A "regular" fry is enough for three adults btw.<//Text>

Love the ability to customize, but a bit pricey.  Free peanuts are fun, and staff is always cheerful, but think I prefer their competitor with the same color scheme.</Text>

<Review>Purchased a pre-owned Highlander in their used vehicle lot. Worked with Sunny and he worked with our numbers, was fast and painless. He gave us  really fair deal for both our trade-in and our purchase. Milly the business manager was also great to work with. These guys weren't pushy and worked with us all the way through the process. Was a pleasure to work these folks.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Came in person looking for upper radiator support and possibly wheels for my 08 Civic. Didn't end up buying anything that day, but Rich (gentleman with glasses) was polite, knowledgeable and very honest about pricing. Don't mind if he picks up a phone call during ur conversation because they get alot of inquiries. Would absolutely come back in the future. Parking is a mild challenge.<//review>< Date>

<text>I found what I thought was a needed part on eBay and sent an inquiry. They responded immediately. Although I ended up not buying the part, they took the time to explain where I was wrong and sent me in the right direction.

bought 4 dually steel wheels for my 2003 F350. guy sells me wheels for older non-metric pattern 1998 and below. i told him they wouldnt work as ive owned several of both generation but he swore they were correct. well the same day i brought them home i figured out they were not correct. later that week he said one got sold after we initially met. so i waited patiently for him to get a replacement over several weeks and our schedules were clashing as i drove for work. this employee lived in my same town and he did save me a drive by bringing them up. so i do appreciate that even though he sold me the wrong wheels. eventually right when i was out of town he HAD to get me the last wheel. he did do me a favor and drop it off at my cousins house. well it was from a 80s chevy! the hub size was not even correct. this was the worst experience ive had with an auto wrecker. i dont expect them to make it right but ill give them the opportunity. he complained saying i got too good of a deal on them... so used, rusty steel wheels for $50 a pop used or i could have bought new ones for $70 shipped each! I WAS TRYING TO SUPPORT A LOCAL BUSINESS but sometimes you learn the hard way.</Review>

Do not buy parts from these folks expecting service after the sale, or even much service at all. Bought parts online from ABC through Amazon & the parts are not as advertised, the bearing plate has to be adjusted according to encclosed directions. That's not strap on ready. So I called these guys. Who after not listening to a word I said about my issue confirmed that the parts were supposed to o be strap on ready, and if they weren't I should call Honda.... Then called me back to tell me they don't sell on Amazon.. so at first you thought I had purchased them from you and your answer was "it's your problem not ours, call you're dealership" Then afterwards you discovered that I purchased them from Amazon so it's the resellers responsibility. Either way it's crappy service, false advertisement about the ease of installation and the guy who answers the phone might be a great technician or a wonderful human being but if he is so stressed out that he can't handle helping someone out over the phone without being a jerk then you might want to hire some more help..(and take the phone away from him) because it will be a cold day in Southern Florida before.I purchase another ABC autopart... From ANYWHERE</Review>

<review>The vendors and actual market is great. The atmosphere and vibe is good, too. It's just super crowded. Parking is a nightmare, so just beware of that.<//review>< user_name>

< Review>
Newly opened areas for foot tragic flow; gives this place a welcomed new  feel!  Sunday's only 9am 5pm

No parking. Parking lot was full. If you can find one, street parking available.

Admission...$5

The line to get in was long. However, the line moved quickly and we were in!

100 +  friendly vendors offering you the best deal they can.

Live DJ Killing it!
And Various Music playing here and there as you stroll looking for those sleepers (hidden treasure)!

Shady areas to relax/ post.

Delicious Food trucks to fuel you when you get the munchies. And yes, Rest rooms available and clean.

If you enjoy:
A lively atmosphere.
Youthful spirited energy.
Friendly faces. And a barrage of clothing, vintage items, oddities, Art,  etc.

Then I'll see you there!< /Review>

Great location & variety of vendors. So many great finds, but also some vendors have the audacity to try over-charging for used clothing items that you could buy new today at Macy's for less 😅 do your research & haggle as necessary< /Review>

<review>Overpriced. No "Trading" going on. Hipster Hangout. Gone are the days of anything worthwhile vintage. $5 to enter, I got a huge bag of pine cones as they are everywhere on the ground for the taking. Def $5 worth of cones, RIP Melrose Trading Post.<//review>< rate>

Really nice experience. Not a lot of social distancing but definitely encouraged. Mask were worn by mostly everyone. The Thai and Jamaican food trucks offered some great tasting food. I found some vintage and trendy items here. I would suggest prepurchasing a ticket to avoid waiting in line.<//review>

It was $5 per adult to enter. We parked for free up the street in the residential area because it was Sunday. I didn't think anything was swap meet pricing and I think most of the second hand stores from Melrose Ave. opened a booth here. It was an entertaining afternoon and the Pad Thai from the food truck was delicious.<//Review>

<review>MTP - As of 3/28- awesome place to shop vintage and high and low brow wares. Must wear a mask to enter and pay for a ticket. Proceeds benefit art programs for the fairfax highschool grounds that the market takes place on. Some vendors will also negotiate the prices. I bought a vintage italian sweater from the 70s for $25 instead of 35. And a Canon 35 mm camera from ' 99 for $60.
Not bad!
They also have many garden and house plants as well as holistic and organic options to clean your home.
But if you're looking for cheap costume jewelry, sun glasses and the perfect distressed tee, this ... Is the spot to be.</review><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Definitely come by, tons of very cool vendors and unique stuff. Absolutely worth visiting if you're looking for some retro goods (clothes, vinyls, postcards). Don't confuse this with a vintage store or thrift market, these are artisans and these goods are not necessarily cheap.< /text>

Intriguing. My first time there. I was surprised to see such a counterintuitively large public attraction on the eve of a major regional pandemic shutdown, but everyone I saw was masked properly and socially distanced. Hopefully it will continue to operate during the holiday season, I'd like to return.< /review>

<review>Great choice of vendors! The vibe here was so chill! Found some good stuff. Plants galore! Go early when it's not so damn hot. There are a few food trucks. I got super lucky with the parking but it is a challenge getting down Genesee Ave. Very narrow street.  Looking forward to my next visit.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The place to find unique one-off items. From clothing and accessories to furniture and trinkets. I love wandering around the aisles, getting lost and promising myself not to spend any more money. Hard to do.

They raised entrance fee prices from $3 to $5. Cash is best to have on you for most of these merchants.

Come right when it opens to find the best items. Or if you just want to browse, take your time and get here before they close or else you’ll get a million reminders on the loud speaker about closing in x-amount of minutes.

There’s a cute food court area - all located out doors. Get coffees here, rest your legs and unwind.

I love how people who shop here are wearing amazing, trendy clothes.<//text>

I love this flea market. It’s there every Sunday and there’s always so much to choose from. I saw Heidi Klum there with her daughter last time I went! Definitely check it out if you’re in the area. There is free valet parking here as well or street parking available. There’s always live music and food trucks here with delicious food!</Text>

We found treasures! New hand painted shirts through to vintage glass! Held at Fairfax High School grounds on Melrose, only on Sunday, the area this market takes up was very worthwhile taking the time to go and wander through, as it’s extensive. If you’re looking for an ‘Aladdin’s Cave’ treasure hunt market, this is it. Beautiful array of stock, a visual feast, well set up alleyways. Good food available, the restrooms are in the school building, and walkways are asphalt, some shaded, some sunny. also had a beaut little mini golf area kids can use for FREE, using fancy shoes as the bumpers.<//Text></record>

This is the place to go to in downtown when you don't know exactly what you want to eat or when you're with a lot of people and you can't decide where to eat. This place is packed with flavor from different parts of the world. I was able to see Thai food, Chinese food, Salvadorian food, Mexican food, Italian food, and even vegan food (yes, I know vegan food isn't a part of the world but it deserves recognition as a food category haha). There are also little markets inside that sell produce, meat, spices, and candies. This place has it all!< /review>

So many options here. There is something for everyone. You can't go wrong with any store here, even the shop that sells mole. It does get crowded but can't complain about it. That is the nature of Melrose Trading Post. Parking prices are pretty decent for downtown L.A.< /review>

<text>This place is massive! It's also a bit of a maze so I would suggest getting a map. Don't come here if you are looking to get valuable items for super cheap prices. This isn't junkers laying stuff on tarps (which I happen to love also). The sellers here know what's for sale and prices are similar to antique stores or Etsy.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Not as good as it used to be even though it is bigger now. The set up seems to have no rhyme or reason now and not a lot of cool stuff like before. LACC is just as good if not better now and is a lot less to get in to.</review>

We love the Melrose Trading Post, it opens every Sunday on Fairfax, supporting the local High School.

There are so many vendors filled with creatives who’ve come together to bring you affordable one of a kind pieces from; furniture to antiques, to jewelry, clothes, a shiatsu massage, crystals, vinyl records, dream catchers, plants... etc

There is a lovely square of food trucks and a live band.

Great place to go with friends, family, or with people visiting!<//Review>

$5 per person is a bit steep for a flea market, reason for two star. Cute stuff but more of a arts and crafts festival than a swap meet.</review>

<text>I didn't know this place before until my daughter who is Miss Jr Teen Hollywood was there to sell some cookies in order to help some non proffit organizations. This place remind me of my home town Tlacolula plaza because there are a lot of different vendors so you can enjoy different kind of foods and flavors. You can also rest under a big tree with a big shade there. The cost for the entry is $5.00 each person. If one day you are there, I hope you search for the girls, Miss Hollywood and help them to help the program "No Kids Go Hungry." They sell water and sodas too.</text>< Pictures>

We also always go to the food area and get crepes and lemonade.  They have so many choices though.  Live music as well.  The best Sunday hangout.  Entry is now $5, I seem to recall. Might want to bring cash, although most vendors do square now.< /text>< pics>

You can find an eclectic variety of wares here: vintage clothing, artisan and vintage jewelry, houseplants, antiques, local artists, new furniture from local craftsmen, food for all tastes and diets, knick-knacks galore, and even more items in between. Most vendors inside accept cash and cards, but be prepared for the cash-only entrance fee of $5. You’re guaranteed to find something you didn’t know you wanted every time you go.< /Review><user_name>Joshua Williams<//user_name><Date>1552326581516</Date>< resp>

<review>Very fun to see artisans and makers alongside antique and thrift sellers. Lots of great clothing, house wares, plants and several great food vendors as well. Will probably make this a weekly visit. Make sure you check out Raphael Creations.</review>< date>

This place is amazing. I could get lost in this market for days. Downside is that some things are just overly priced but worth perusing.</Review>

It carries a $5 entry, but once you're in you're greeted with mostly vintage clothes, a few succulents and/or house plants vendors, some vintage print places, local Jewelers, vintage furniture, and a pretty great coffee place. It's more of a quirky outdoor home decor shop with a cover fee, but it does have its gems. Go here for clothing, or home decor.

And there was a line to get in. But that's all expected so if you aren't up for that, you chose the wrong place. Inside though, there are great vendors. Everyone was very friendly and tasty food stuffs!
Here's a photo of something that made me smile.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBSTY3dcp7lDes1T-1XtHWmZoCYZORXUPuUoBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I love hunting for treasures here. It gets pretty packed with “trendy” people who mostly shop for vintage clothes, which works great for me because it keeps the crowds concentrated at the clothing booths while I look for home decor. You’re able to find anything from antique pieces to modern handmade crafts. Most of the vendors are the same every week, but some change out and you’re able to find new things every time.< /review>

I love this place! If you re looking for just a walk in a vintage flee market, or to buy something specific, original, vintage, or artistic, this is the best place ever. It's fun, there s always music, the crowd is nice and friendly, kind of a community that shares common interests. Great spot!< /Text>

My first time at a flea market! There are two entrances ($3 each person). It's cash only, but if you don't have cash there is an ATM right by the entrance. Inside there are a lot of vintage items & stores that sell sunglasses, clothes, furniture, accessories, candles, food, & just some random items. Reminds me of an upscale outdoor swapmeet. It's only on Sunday's and it's just a fun spot to walk around! You may find a treasure or two!<//Review>

Love the authentic italian food and choices, not to mention the cheap prices. You get your food like cafeteria style but it's so good and you can ask for small alterations in your order without the price going up. For example I wanted less noodles and more meat sauce. No bbn problem! They only accept cash is the only bad thing.</review>

This has to be one of the most trendiest flea market I have ever been to. They so much great and unique vendors. I was finally able to find the perfect camo jacket Ive been looking for, for lower than store price. The boyfriend and I got some healing gem stones for 2 for $15 and so on. I def would recommend!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e</Gmap_id></record>

If you check the website, there's usually a coupon for $1 off entry.

Early bird def gets the worm here.  If you arrive early there's parking, but if you are like most of LA you aren't gonna get any parking, good luck with that!

As my friend says, it's like an outdoor goodwill, so you don't get the musty smells.  Are you spending an arm and leg on stuff you can get for a few dollars at Goodwill?  Probably!  But the goods are always unique and there are also almost always celebrities if that's your thing.

There is always awesome music in the food area.  And the food isn't bad either!  The guy in the corner doing corn bowls is awesome with delicious kombucha on tap.  Other notable eateries include the crepe place and there are always samples of fries.<//review>

Not exactly my style per say... very vintage.
The music, food and drinks were great ! Very nice set up too. The plants (for purchase) were BEAUTIFUL. Extremely hot inside here though because of all the tents. Also, I think the entrance fee of $5 was a little silly.< /Review>

<Text>I luv this smallish swap..The vendors are very nice for the most  part...Another reason I come is the CVT soft serve truck by the entrance. Jammin' soft serve.

Then I drive down the Street to Little Johns toffee @Farmers Market...the Carmel apples r to die for.< /Text>< Date>

This flea market never gets old. I love spending my Sundays here. The food is great and sitting and listening to the music is nice. Always something to purchase and prices are better now then when I used to go a couple years back. I would say you can clear about 2-3 hours of the day here. Even though it’s $5 now I still think it’s a good deal. They do have $1 coupons online so check it out. Also, you may bump into your favorite celebrity or musician because there always some wondering around.</review>

But that's all expected so if you aren't up for that, you chose the wrong place. Inside though, there are great vendors. Everyone was very friendly and tasty food stuffs!
Here's a photo of something that made me smile.< /review>< pics>

<Review>The Melrose Trading Post is a weekly (Sundays) flea market type of outing, and it features many eclectic and trendy artisan and collectibles-type of vendors. I went here for the fragrances by RxCandles, a great producer of fine scents for personal and home use in aromatherapy.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1563503606957<//date><name>Jay Ammon<//name>< user>

5 dollars to get in. Some booths are, to be honest, just people looking to get rid of junk they found at a thrift store. Some people sell vintage clothes (also probably thrifted) that could probably be cool but they’re a little hard to look through. The cooler vendors in my opinion were the ones selling handmade and refurbished furniture, some sold handmade jewelry, and the plant vendors were fairly priced. A good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</review>

Great place to check out if your in need of a decent deal, market food, shop till you drop and find a rare item.  Lotta vendors are trying to out price you so be ready to haggle.  Great time and will go again.  Please track the whole place or you won’t know!< /review>

This place is a complete dive.  You can get everything there cheaper elsewhere.  If you buy there you're getting ripped. Super bored, disengaged unfriendly people.  $5 just to get in and look.  $5 just to look!? Zero atmosphere. Went to The Grove right after - it's free to look, straight away you're 5 bucks up.  It's also absolutely beautiful, not a grim dust ball; far better experience, product and prices.  Many other better things to do than get scammed at this dive market.</review>

Fun, and I thought there was a lot of variety in vendors. Vintage clothes intermingled with artist Renditions of old and new ideas. I found some great antique jewelry reasonably priced. A few seamstresses out there making some unique athletic wear as well as club attire. There is a cover charge to get in... I think it is worth it as I'm sure it decreases the vendors lease fee and not everybody sells what they'd like.< /Text>

This is a great "flea" market.  There are some that are mostly trash, but not this one.  It is well known and has great vendors of used, new and a mix of both.  Really good food vendors too.  Have only been a couple of times, but had good shoping experiences.  Have also had good breakfast burritos and even good live music.  Not only is it a shopping experience, but full family entertainment too.  Will always,go out of our way to check it out whenever in town.<//text>

<Text>This place is great! I love that the admission fee goes to a local high school's programs. The street market itself has a wonderful variety of handmade jewelry and products from local vendors, and folks selling vintage/used items. A great spot to find unique gifts or just to spend an afternoon (plan on taking some time to get through it all).< /Text><UserId.>115675468528048486791<//UserId.><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

Its a street market showcasing local artistry and people's vintage finds. What other would call junk could also be another person's treasure. No shortage of old clothes and ornaments. There's a vendor there that has a whole department store section for aloha shirts for 7.00. Great fit for summer or for a gift for your trendy teen. It's bigger than you think so take the time to explore. Also, say hi to all the dogs you'll see. Came around 1:20, didn't find parking until 2:00 so I suggest coming early. There's also a mini street market across the street. It's a great Instagram photo spot due to the fact that there's an angel wing mural at the entrance of it. Great place to visit for 2 or so hours.< /Text>

Rock 'n Roll heaven. The $3 admission goes entirely to arts education at Fairfax High. Art is the Heart of civilization. Great food, great finds, tons of fun. a curated vintage, up cycled, recycled and hand made goods post. Multiple music options throughout, bathrooms, trash cans, valet parking, website. Open ever Sunday...your spirit will be moved.</Text>

<text>Of the flea market offerings in LA, this is a big one.  However, the dominant item is clothes, clothes, clothes.  If you are looking for curated/vintage home goods or local artists, artisans, etc, this swap meet does have some, but they are few in number compared to the clothing offerings.  It's mainly a younger crowd, so whatever used-clothing trend is happening at the moment for that audience, you'll find a lot of here.</text></record>

A fun place to spend an afternoon, but less useful for making purchases. From my perspective, the household goods weren't very varied, well-priced or high quality, but may just not be my style. Great people watching and food trucks though and admission is only $3 per person. I'd really like to give this spot 3.5 stars.

Also, uncomfortable restroom experience - guests can use bathrooms in the high-school, but the doors are so low that people standing in line waiting for the rest rooms can see you over your stall. Not sure how this isn't a problem for high-school students...</Review>

____________________________________

Love this outdoor flea market. Great unique finds!
However, lately I’ve noticed the vendor’s prices increasing and merchandise is becoming a little too expensive which completely contradicts that of an  traditional flea market or swap meet.<//Text>< time>

This is the coolest market I've seen! Flee Market, maybe, but more like artisan trading post!
Obviously there's a ton of clothes, but you can find art, accessories, gadgets, and even games!

This is a must-see I'm Los Angeles!</Review>

5 bucks to get in and it's worth it. Tons of variety of things, but mostly clothes. People are interesting and there is live music of varying degrees of quality. I also saw some people going crazy over some "famous" people there, but I didn't know who they were.<//Text>

I see this as an over rated market. Clothes, furniture and food - all were below average. The only good thing is to enjoy the music and songs played by the musicians. Also, few plant shops are wonderful. Also, the entrance fee varies depending upon your arrival time.</Review>

After arriving in 1997 & moving into the neighborhood it became one of my regular weekend destinations . Super cool then as now! A Melrose tradition! I love the early morning crush to get in... vendors & patrons. My most fond memories of the flea market are attending with all of my old friends. Remembering 20 years of sleepy mornings rolling down to the post. #oldschool #vintagestuff #ravers Thank You.</Text>

It was a first visit for me. Lots of cool stuff, though a bit expensive (I think) for old, raggedy, stained vintage clothing. The atmosphere was chill I enjoyed the whole scene.<//review>

You have to come here! First off, the $3 admission ticket goes to the high school to help pay for programs that get cut (arts, physical fitness, etc). And then plan to stay AT LEAST four hours here. It’s amazing. So many different type of booths from grunge and cheap to chic and pricey. I stumbled upon this going up Melrose on a Sunday and I’m so glad I did! One of my favorite activities during my trip to LA.</Text>

Really fun Sunday activity! They have food and live music inside. Make sure to bring sunscreen and water though, it gets really hot and a fresh lemonade inside will cost you $5!< /Text>

NOT a flea market! But perfectly nice. Definitely too pricey 2nd hand stuff and fancy new stuff.  Pleasant to wander around though and nice food stalls.<//Review>

Much nicer than the flea markets at home, makes for a nice day.  Like any flea market there will be things youre not interested in aeeing or buying, but looking around with patience may yield some results</text>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>The hot spot for LA’s urban dwellers every Sunday, Fairfax High School parking lot is filled to the max of hipsters and kiosks ready to upscale your wardrobe or you interior decorating. Entry fee is under $5 and you can literally spend a whole day here checking out the shops, some live music and a delicious snow cone. Every trip to the Flea Market I walk away with new hand crafted jewelry or a groovy pair of sunglasses. Do yourself a favor and brave the parking to come wander around the asphalt, it will not disappoint.<//Review>< pictures>

This place is crazy, no offense, but when you hear that assume an offensive comment follows. It's a giant thrift store outdoors, most of it and I mean most, is used clothing. So if your into the whole BoHo seen, head right over.</Review>

The lady at the front taking "mandatory donations" is extremely rude! Also most items at this "flee market" are extremely over priced...you can buy brand new at regular retail stores for cheaper or same prices.<//review>

From looking good new products to garbage
From something you want to be a little expensive to selling at a reasonable price
There are many kinds of things, so it's fun to watch them and the time goes by quite a bit, but I personally have nothing to buy ^^;

푸드트럭같은 식사, 작은 공연, 옷, 화분, 악세서리, 골동품, 가구, 신발, 사진, 액자, 카메라, 캔들 정말 다양한 종류를 한 데서 팔고 있었습니다.
괜찮아보이는 새제품부터 쓰레기가 아닌가 싶은 것까지
조금 비싸다 싶은 것부터 꽤 저렴하게 파는것까지
여러 종류의 것들이 있다보니 구경만해도 재미도 있고 시간이 꽤 금방 지나갑니다만 개인적으로 전딱히살건없더라고요^^;< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9CHEgcgLns8Zy6LkHxooD5Fu-eSReINOpcnF2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw6GcGEM2sRiYmwsC0g9nkYHyx6Xsl56ROt1KY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvil352mD7IShtvo8anzXGw5Ei6TBNL6cQJd47=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGfcDctGhshTRP4hp5wzSpux2jJZXlb0KexF7e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1ZYYy5RoRmzzIGAndQNTPwchlWiVqXTpBAF_h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) You don't have to buy anything, but after paying $ 5, you can watch every corner and listen to live performances.

딱히 살 건 없다지만 5불 내고 구석구석 살펴본 뒤 라이브 연주 들으며 푸드코트 이용하는 것만으로 좋다.< /text>

(Translated by Google) One of the best popular markets in Los Angeles and worth a visit, the prices are very reasonable and the merchandise is very unique and there is music on stage in the food side. Overall the place is worth a try.

It opens only on Sunday, the entrance fee to the place is $ 5. Most places require cash to pay, but there are withdrawal machines with an additional fee.

(Original)
من أفضل الأسواق الشعبية في لوس أنجلس و يستحق الزيارة، الأسعار مناسبة جدا و البضاعة جدا فريدة و يوجد موسيقى على المسرح في جهة المأكولات. بشكل عام المكان يستحق التجربة.

يفتح فقط يوم الأحد، رسوم الدخول الى المكان ب٥ دولار. أغلب الأماكن تتطلب كاش للدفع، و لكن تتواجد مكاين سحب مع رسوم إضافية.</review>

(Translated by Google) A large flea market held every weekend at high school.
It costs $ 5 per person to enter.
It can be purchased for less than half the price of used clothing stores in Japan.
They also sold miscellaneous goods, accessories, antiques, used clothes and furniture.
There are many stylish people so you can enjoy just entering.

(Translated by Google) There are many cute shops that are smaller than Rosebowl's flea market! Compared to rosebowl, there are more accessory stores, so this is recommended for those who want a necklace.
You can enjoy a variety of food trucks and live performances.

<Review>(Translated by Google) There was a lot to see, but it was too hot.. The admission fee also rose to 5 dollars. It is worth going at least once.
