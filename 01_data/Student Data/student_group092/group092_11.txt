<text>Horrible experience.  Salesman Larry won my business by promising May 1st install date.  May 1st came and went.  No-show.  I called them (they did not call me) to push for another install date.  They promised May 3rd., 8am-4pm window.  No-show, and no communication.....I called them......the process repeated., and repeated, and repeated.....they finally showed up on install date 6.  Yep, there were no-shows 5 times.  Jasmine, installation coordinator, lied to me multiple times.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1621024711171, 'text': "Benjamin, we're sorry that this has happened.

< Review>
Worst experience of my life. It took multiple crews multiple days to do our home and they damaged so much stuff that we had to be reimbursed from empire by getting 3 quotes from contractors and then getting our reimbursement back from empire took forever for damage they caused.
This company is extremely unorganized no one knew what was going on. Their model is  quantity over quality. Get the guys in and out as fast as they can and on to the next job. They only pay their guys by the job, so in a house that’s going to require more time and skill it won’t happen since the workers need to be in and out.
Also they couldn’t even lay carpet correctly in our box shaped bedrooms there was a huge seem running right down the middle I noticed right away. Then in our closet where I guess they think you won’t go, exposed tax strips.
1st crew couldn’t finish our job since showing up at 4pm but they were kind enough to pull all the carpet off the stairs and lay down tax strips and say ok we have to go now and we are not sure we will be back. So we had them cover the exposed tax strips with cut off carpet as we also have pets and they won’t know to avoid those and good thing because it was a few days till another crew came back. That crew 2nd crew spent all day trying to wrap our stairs and got one done that was done poorly. They kept telling me there was no way anyone else in our 62 unit complex had these stairs. Nope they all do it’s how they were built. 2nd crew left still we had exposed tax strips on our stairs that we are using scrap pieces to cover. Finally the third guy Caesar only guy who knows what he is doing was able to wrap the stairs and oh said he had done another unit just like ours in our complex. He also had to fix our other normal set of stairs as those were not done correctly by 2nd crew. On one bottom piece they  literally just stuck the carpet piece up to it so it was free floating. Then the rest needed to be done as it was frayed looking they couldn’t get the bull nose of the stair correct. So finally no more exposed tax strips but to bad one cat stepped on one, thankfully not bad.
Then finally the 4th guy to fix the closets and cover the tax strips.
2nd crew removed our stair handrail and put gashes in our drywall that had to be re-mudded and painted. They also broke of piece of wood from the handrail and then didn’t put it back on. 3rd guy put it back on cause he said you can’t wrap the stairs with it off and was baffled by why the other guys took it off. Our bedroom door was broken at the bottom and we had so many scratches everywhere from everything needing to be redone multiple times.
I will never use empire again even though their sales team has called me twice and I keep telling them to remove me from their call list I will never buy anything from you again.</Review>

ust a quick note of appreciation for the Empire Today team. Don our sales advisor showed up exactly on time and gave us an education on the types of laminate floorings.  We had been shopping at the big box home improvement stores, and they offered no suggestions or advice and seemed like they just hoped we would leave them alone, Don presented our best options within our budget and we signed the contract with confidence we were getting the best product at an awesome price.
From the minute I met the installation team of  Josh and Jota, I felt honesty, superior knowledge, and confidence they would do an excellent job. They arrived both days precisely on time, explained what they would be doing, and worked quickly and professionally. They had great attitudes and were friendly and considerate. The installation was perfect, completed on time and not a trace of debris or waste was left behind.  Working in real estate I will be recommending  Empire to my clients and office.  Thanks for exceeding my expectations!  A+ A+ A+< /Review>

Beware, my sister got her carpet removed to put floor tiles on the stairs, although they were nice people they left holes on our carpet way leading upstairs and my room now has a carpet ripping off the floor. On top of that they never came back to fix the rest of the flooring, definitely do not recommend this place whatsoever.</Text>

<Review>We are so disappointed. I've called customer service several times without a return call. We paid a lot of money for these floors and its just cheap work that was half done. Gaps everywhere and glue sticking out from the thresholds. I wish we kept our original floors now. $22,000 for this work is unacceptable. Also didn't help that the person installing the floors rummaged thru my laundry room to use my broom on the dusty glued old flooring, while he replaced the broom with a cheaper one, it was unprofessional to use without asking. If you need new floors search around and find someone that can do a better quality job. DO NOT use Empire Flooring.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUeEIfjAIvhAJeUR2VSn_Iho6jBByZ_YVdd539=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwGtprwrJCvpwVOSU_wExmRtSO3Wq52GtYTSwC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-xYhmm6J3ZmmWqeib0Z5IaV9UVS-1f0veVC4L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYxOYGodoaev_PMOIZewyT7cL02bAoMIm_qTf0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPJBiA-eSSb6sbSIKal8QzqOlF-l1HxgI90JrU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Over priced, I would say borderline scam.
2000 sqft of laminate quoted at 21k. This is their half price sale??? Which means normal price is 42k. Seems very wrong! Sales person said good luck and would not discuss other pricing options.< /Text>< Resp>

Decent carpet for the price but read the fine print...

They will completely screw up your base trim and won't do anything about it.

What good is free installation if you have to hire a painter to come in after to repaint ALL your base trim?

Wish I had gone elsewhere for carpet and install.<//review>

Terrible first experience with Empire.
Scheduled a carpet install for Dec 29th, but days later I received an email stating it was for the 30th. I called and they said they made a mistake and would knock off $200 for the inconvenience. Great. I take the 30th off work to prep and be there for the installers and never received a call for a eta. I called them and they said I was scheduled for the 9th of Jan not the 30th, then all of a sudden it’s the 11th of Jan. Whaaaaaat!?!?! This was not the agreement and I may have missed out on Home Depot’s free installation offer because I decided to go with this incompetent business. Not good, Empire. Not good.<//Text>

I have had major issues trying to get them to correct the situation and this has been going on for 8 months now! We purchased just before COVID-19 wood flooring for the 2nd floor of our Home and for the stairs and spent multiple Thousands of dollars!  The installer was good but we had some issues that I sent photos of and after 6 months of calling they came to look at and agreed there were mistakes made. They sent a supervisor to replace 5 stairs and he made them worse but left anyways and now they have been avoiding me since and that was 3 months ago!

I have one Attorney who said I should sue for the entire purchase price because they continue to charge me interest even when there has been a problem since March!!</Text>

I was linked with Empire Today through Home Advisor. I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because they were prompt about contacting me and scheding an appointment. It all went downhill from there. I clearly communicated what flooring I needed (tile brand, color and grout) as well as how I wanted it installed (herringbone) to  the person scheduling the appointment. However, the sales representative was completely unprepared. He did not know if you could even install herringbone and had to call someone. He hadn't even determined the tile/grout was available or the price of it. To top it off he left saying I would have a quote in 2-3 days. 4 days later someone else called me from  Empire asking if I received my quote. By this time the 3 other companies that I had engaged had already given their quotes. They all showed up to the project having done their homework and just needed to measure the scope of work for final bid. Empire's lack of professionalism and timeliness cost them the chance to complete for this project as well as my next 2 projects I have lined up.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>EMPIRE TODAY! LEAVES HANDICAPPED CUSTOMER TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR! Today, an Empire installer arrived at Andrew's Kent, WA home to install carpet. Andrew is severely handicapped, and his brother and financial custodian had arranged with the company to make phone payment with the installers while they were on site and working. The problem arose when the installers arrived early, demanding payment before they would begin work, and Andrew couldn't immediately contact his brother to confirm payment. Rather than recognize the unique situation, the installers would not lift a finger to begin work, but left Andrew sitting on the porch, while they left to other jobs. Andrew's brother then spent the rest of the day--on telephone hold--with Empire's impersonal and powerless call centers. Have you ever spent a day on maddening hold with customer service, only to realize that they are powerless to do anything on your behalf? They just give you continuous cliches about how sorry they are for your inconvenience? That was our day with Empire. It was clear throughout the day that Empire's business model is not one tailored to customer service. The lesson for consumers is simple. First, no credible carpet company would demand payment in advance, before inspection of work is completed. Second, no reputable carpet company would employ installers that cannot recognize a unique situation and work within that situation in the customers' interest. Finally, Empire is a company that employs an impersonal call center "barrier," with telephone agents that are powerless to take action and are disconnected with other company departments. When you pay one department by phone, you can be sure that your payment will take hours, or days, to be communicated to other departments. All these are valuable lessons to be learned about Empire. But the most important is that EMPIRE TODAY!

The final product was outstanding quality, both porcelain tile that looks like hardwood and plush carpet that both turned out fantastic!  There were a couple of small communication bumps initially with scheduling delayed by a day, but the people were always very nice. The tile installers, especially Manny, were particularly kind and did an outstanding job. Our sales rep Lynda was very knowledgeable and patient with our questions, and Bret in local customer service was very professional.</review>

Working with this company was very refreshing. The sales rep measured the room, worked up the estimate, we discussed budget, and came to an agreement on price and scheduled the install all within a hour or so. The installer arrived on time. He was obviously experienced. The job was done in 4 hours. We will definitely contact Empire when we are ready to replace flooring in the rest of the house.<//review>

The experience couldn't have been much worse if they had tried and we cancelled the rest of the order.  BEWARE of Empire.  We had laminate installed in the family room, kitchen and laundry room thinking we were getting water proof flooring.  The installers told us it was only water repellent meaning any spills had to be removed within an hour.  Who would want that in a kitchen or laundry room?!  Then the installers told us we needed a moisture sealant on the foundation at the cost of an additional $700.  Nice surprise!  We live in Escondido and only had 3" of rain the last year.  It seems to me ethics are lacking at this company.  We decided we were done with Empire and cancelled the order.  Then they offered to reduce the price of the carpet for the rest of the house by $1200.  We told them we don't do business with this type of company.  WATCH OUT FOR EMPIRE.  The salesman (Sam) will tell you anything to get you to sign a contract.< /Text>

<Review>I had one of the easiest requests possible. A small room needing carpet. The installers did not remove the previous flooring as the sales person stated they would. Once they got my money there was no return calls from the sales person and customer service was terrible this is my 7th call to get this resolved and still no return call. I had 3 other rooms to do but I’m not going through this again.<//Review></record>

<text>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! The sales guy we had was completely HORRIBLE! Very cringy. He didn't bring us but only three samples of carpet AND laminate. Was very rude and pushy. He asked way too many personal questions, such as asking us how much our car was, how much we put down as a down payment, how much our house was, etc. way too personal. He made inappropriate jokes. He was all around horrible. He promised us we would get carpet two days later considering they were all booked up. That was a problem because we had paid movers to come the day he wanted to install, so we had to cancel movers and reschedule and pay a couple hundred for that. We were PROMISED installation on Thursday. Well guess what, Thursday morning comes and I get an email saying carpet is not going to be installed. Customer service is a joke. No help. Management didn't want to do anything. Now I have to pay the movers a SECOND TIME TO RESCHEDULE because they don't have enough materials. Horrible service all around. Only settled for this company because we needed fast installation. So much for next day!! Even second day. Don't use.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1538679462091, 'text': "Felicia, we know your time is valuable and we regret to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations.

They did a great job and they did it for honestly a really low price. I am sorry other people didn’t have a great experience. They were exceptional.

Oh, My! Run don't walk from this company! I don't get it, they spend a fortune advertising to us on T.V. Then when they come out, you basically find out you have wasted your time. I am on hold with them right now as I write this. We called, we set an appointment, a lady came out and promised us everything we asked for. She did not have enough time to finish our quote. She promised she would email it that evening. The email did not come in the evening nor the morning. I called Empire the next morning and asked what's up? They called the sales lady and said I would be getting a call. That call never came!! So I'm on hold with them right now to see where the quote is.

There are so many carpet places, I would not even call these guys all they do is suck your time.</review>

Empire flooring installed flooring on my staircase, however a error was detected, I notified the Co. they immediately sent someone out to view it. In a very short time the staircase was completely corrected together with a couple of other errors and thanks to Andy everything was done to perfection.  I would highly recommend Empire and especially Andy. I am very pleased with the end result.< /text>

Stay away from this company! Far away!
I had purchase flooring from them in January of 2019. I had a horrible interaction with them that time and still another one with this time! The salesman skipped corners of the appraisal so when the workers came to the job they were unprepared and did not have the right tools and pieces to install my floor (because there was a step in my house that had not been placed on the appraisal so they did not have the step stair-nose). Needless to say the install started taking place and and what was supposed to take 2 days took 5 days. I called to complain because I had lost a significant amount of money from my job being gone an unexpected 5 days instead of 2 (I was on the phone with customer service several times throughout this job and no one could ever seem to help me). I was hung up on by one teller because I told her I would wait on hold for the manager to get on the phone and she said she needed her line freed up to take other calls. Finally the manager called me back and did nothing for me. I emailed a very long message to their corporate office and they subsidized my cost of installation by $600 due to the money lost in my days of not working unexpectedly. Didn't account for the significant emotional stress I endured through this! However, why could no one at the managerial or general manager level help me at the SD location?? No idea!
Later, July of 2019 I had a house flood which led to some removal of my brand new flooring and needing to be replaced. I did not want to go through Empire, but was forced to because they would not sell me the floor out right and apparently monopolize the flooring industry to some degree, so only they sell the type of floor that they put in my home. I know this because my restoration company and homeowners insurance attempted to find it for me before I was forced to go through them again. So, an assessment had to be done through Empire which they charged me $170 for (but when you call to get a home estimate, it's free), but nonetheless I was at a loss because I had to go through them apparently. $170 later they said they could install for me the same floor because it was not old, and I got it done 9/18/2019. It looked the same one piece to another piece - and it was to some degree; however, when laid down and installed was noticeably different in sheen and texture/feel of it. I told their GM once again that it's not the same and they need to install the same flooring as they promised me. He argued it was the same. In fact, I spoke to him many times and the first reason for it not being the same was because of the chemicals I wipe my floors with. Water? Water can change texture to that degree? No. The boss installer revisited my house - funny, because the installer who came back out to look at it took pictures and took a slab from both old and new floor to show the significant difference because he stated it was significantly different. I told the GM (Jay Slate) I would pay for the job when it was done, as promised (but it was not done, it was not the same floor). I told the GM they needed to come back and install the same floor or I need to look into replacing my whole floor if this was not possible (which would mean another insurance claim). He said he was going to send my account to collections for the $775 I needed to pay them for the incorrect floor they installed. I have contacted the BBB.

I noticed on the other reviews that reach out to every reviewer on here to tell them to contact them to get a better solution. Empire.... your customer service representatives, management, and even GM is awful! There is nothing you can do to fix a scam company like yourself except start being honest and fair! When your GM is awful, you know your company is meant for scams!</review>

BUYER BEWARE!!!! I ordered carpet from Empire. The sales woman Sharon was unorganized and condescending. Made several references to how "small" the job was to recarpet my master bedroom. Was very pushy about me giving her my credit card information and seemed concerned about my ability to pay.

On Wednesday, the carpet showed up with a huge tear in the middle of it, so had to reschedule (after I already took a day off work).  Came three days later, on Saturday, they came back with the SAME roll with the tear in it! Unbelievable!! Said that they never had an extra roll to begin with.

My suggestion is go to Tri City Carpet. I went there at 10 am this morning, the same Saturday Empire came, and they are installing it now at 1:30 pm. Amazing customer service. And less expensive than Empire!

Stay away from Empire,  i would give them a negative 5 if possible!</Text>

I had an issue with a renter and the carpet needed to be replaced. The smell from it was so bad that I pulled it up myself and rolled it. I made an appointment for a sales person to come out. Robert came to discuss my needs. I asked him if the carpet layers will clean and scrub the floor befor laying the new carpet. He assured me they will. We placed the order and also received a nice discount. The layers came and just sweped the floor with a broom. Asked them about cleaning it and they said that they dont do that. If I would have been told the truth, I would have cleaned it my self. Anything for a sale. I notified the company and someone would call me back. They did while I was at work and couldn't answer my phone. The told me to give them a call. I know not to trust car sales men. This has been added to the list. I have 2 more rooms to do. I'll revisit Coles.</review>

The Luxury Vinyl Installers, Horrible! - The Carpet Guys, Excellent

This review was asked for by Empire via an email, months after this incident. I did not write this review until Empire asked me to via an email.

I contracted and paid for both carpeting and the Luxury Vinyl Tiles or Planking (LVT or LVP) in 2 bathrooms.

It all was supposed to be done in one day, carpeting and flooring. However when they came on the first trip, they did not have the flooring, just the carpeting. A second appointment was made for the flooring. (The bad part of this was we were having it all installed the day before out-of-town guests arrived to stay at our house.)

The two guys who came out the second time for the flooring, were idiots. Only one spoke very limited English, the other spoke no English. They wouldn't get out of the truck because I had dogs, a pug a Belgian and an old, old Boxer. They wanted the dogs in the house, but the issue is, guess what? The flooring is going to go in the house, not outside!

They wanted me to get rid of the dogs while they were here. What was I supposed to do? Board them? So the main guy, who spoke zero English, refused to do the job. The limited English speaking passenger finally got out of the van and showed the driver the dogs were fine. Nope, the driver wanted them gone from the property. Finally after about 20 minutes of this nonsense, I walked back inside and they sat in the driveway for about 30 minutes. When they went to leave, there was a huge transmission oil spot which I made them clean up, but it still left a mark.

You'd think Empire would be calling me right away. Nope, they didn't until about 3 weeks later. I had moved on by then.

Carpet guys were as nice as could be and did an excellent job.

Would be 5 stars for the carpet guys and just zero stars for the vinyl installers.</review>

<Text>Go to home Depot save yourself a lot of time and frustration
Empire carpet is a  Complete  ripp off
Con job,  waste of time
go to home Depot there price is $5000 out the door
At empire carpet ,  $12,000 minus 50 percent off  $6000  total
and lower ounce face weight carpet

Not a sale at all , or a good deal
deceptive advertising To say the least

Also will not honor installers work
If things go bad and they will !

U have been warned
Empire today no way stay away !<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>If i can give a no star. I will.. Their customer service is very very poor.. The estimator will talk to you nice and will tell you to call anytime if you have a problem.. Tried to call them, left a message. Didn't call back. Ridiculous. The installer are so unprofessional. And was telling me they it is additional to put my bed back. Dude you took it off put it back in. Didn't left a receipt and left his drink on front my house. Like really? Not recommend! 👎👎<//review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Definitely the worst!!
Company lacks any kind of customer service. After overcharging you and installation, you'll never reach them for any disagreement. Do not buy in this company, run away!!!</Review>

I've been going here for about a year. Great small shop for a regular haircut without all that "cool guy" barber feeling. They recently did a remodel and it looked better than ever and kept their low pricing.< /review>

Paul is absolutely the best!  Always gives my son the hair cut just as requested..
My only extremely big disappointment is Christina. I asked her if she knew how to do woman haor cuts. I have extremely long hair and i told her i wanted layers starting at my shoulder and trim the bottom but keep the long length. She repeated what i said and cut away. I got home and she completely ruined my hair. Half my hair is shoulder length and the bottom is shorter on the left side then the right side. By a good 2 inches.  😭😭😭< /review>

<review>I’ve never dealt with such unprofessional behavior from a manager no less, and frankly rude behavior until speaking on the phone with Jorje. Frankly, I called for professional reasons, and after being placed on hold for 10 minutes, Jorje was supposed to assist me and began interrupting me several times, to a point where I couldn’t finish a sentence, and then proceeded to tell me he couldn’t help me without explaining why, then hung up on me instead of taking a message for the supervision to follow up with me. Frankly this person has no place being a manager and behaving this way, especially when speaking with a business, you’re supposed to represent the company and frankly he behaved like a clueless, rude individual.<//review><userid>109033951375025270952</userid></record>

<review>READ THE REVIEWS! They say it all.. I work in the medical field and have to call in RXs (pharmacy) for clients sometimes. They had me waiting for 30mins nobody ever answered to say they were at lunch or just say anything.. After I called back 30 mins later assuming they ARE in lunch tech "WAN" was rude! Through the whole conversation.

Please choice a better pharmacy and dont waste your time. Or dont let your day get ruined by nasty people.

"WAN" (from the pharmacy dept), clearly you are miserable in this facility. For your own sanity and YOUR CLIENTS sanity get transfered or get another job NOT INVOLVING CLIENT CARE.

CVS Pharmacy do you just hire anybody??</review>< pics>

<text>The worst experience ever wait was about 45 minutes to drop off my prescription and an hour to receive my medication. Cashier was so rude because everyone was frustrated waiting. I stead of being apologetic because there so damn lost and slow.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This is a great CVS, just wish it was a bit closer.  I usually go to the CVS near my house but they seem to never have my prescription and this CVS always has it.  So after transferring the prescription back to my CVS and learning that after months, it still wasn't available, I decided to just give in and come to this one.  The parking was easy and the staff was nice and efficient.  It's also close to a lot of places to eat/pick up food which is nice. And its open 24 hours!< /Text>

I have been shopping at CVS Monterey Park for about twenty five years. I have one word to describe their service and products, including the pharmacy -        The descriptive word “ EXCELLENT!!!                                      Review by: Vincent Esequiel Medina,                            Boyle I resident  of. BOYLE HIGHTS LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA.< /review>

After hours here is crazy, it gets so busy here. I was waiting in line for about 10 mins until a real nice lady Daphne came to take over. I couldnt help but notice how much of a hard worker she is. She was working the register and the self check out on her own, it was clear that they were short staffed because poor daphne was the only one up front taking care of all the customers. When it was time to ring me up she helped me with my coupons and even helped me get a better price by explaining a coupon to me. She is so patient and sweet. She honestly deserves employee of the month.</Review>

NEW POST:
Wow, new carpet, remodeled, and service is really good.  The employees are very helpful and make sure you found everything.
OLD POST below:
This store has the dirtiest floors to be selling drugs and hygiene products.  It’s the cheapest and most stained grey carpet I have seen.
We need to fix this issue.<//Review>

Tonight, I had to go to this CVS to get my daughter’s medicine which was an inhaler.  Ana, (in the pharmacy) I believe she saw how bad my daughter was trying to breathe she had the medicine in a few minutes.  I really appreciate what she did for my daughter tonight.  Thank you very much Ana!</text>

Worst CVS in the area!  The cashier staffs are impatient and rude. No smile at all!  If you try to use CVS coupons, you have no chance.  They look like you owe them a million bucks.  It is very dirty and messy all the time in this store.  The management is suck at training staffs (managers need to be trained too), treating customers well and maintaining the store.  Avoid going there, go to other CVS or Rite Aid across the street, more friendly staffs there.<//review>

Cvs management only cares about the bottom line. How much money can they make. Because they only care about that and not how their employees feel or how they're being treated, the employees don't care to put any effort towards taking care of a guest. Why do we support CVS? No one should even be buying a stick of gum there let alone trust them with your personal medical information. The gap between what we expect and what we accept are ridiculous. In other words, we expect our medical care to be given by compassionate professionals who take the time to ask, listen, and understand their patients. We expect to receive this care in a reasonable amount of wait time. Basically there we expect to be cared for by people who have or want to establish a relationship with us. But at CVS, we accept a 3 hour wait time for a prescription that should've been ready and without insurance, to pay a cash price that is up to 10x the price as Costco Pharmacy. How can we possibly expect change when we are accept current conditions? It's not the individual workers fault, it's impossible for anyone to fill the ideal role if a healthcare worker when given a workload meant for 2-3 people.< /Text>

But don't expect to have what you need in stock, pharmacy here is a joke, the night pharmacist is useless, literally only words he said were, "We don't have it", no trying to help in any way. Rest of the staff seemed nice enough, but the place is super dirty. If your prescription plan let's you go to other places use the 24 rite-aid across the street instead, if not find another CVS.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Just like any other CVS... has the basics of what you are looking for. The only problem is getting in and out of the parking lot. Has adequate parking.< /Text>

<Text>I really feel bad with everyone's complaints though is so true. I on the other hand have been treated excellent specially in the pharmacy don't know if it's 'cause I'm handicap everyone is patient n very nice! One main concern is that the public rest rooms are so dirty n I took the initiative to clean it a couple of times. Ooh well life is hard sometimes we don't realize what we are doing wrong when it all starts from the top MANAGEMENT to set a good example! That is my point of view I had more the 25 years in customer service. Hope my review can help others! God bless everyone<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The beauty specialist or manager has poor customer service skills and no beauty knowledge at all what so ever. She's busy touching merchandise and zoning. All she did was confuse and annoy me. The tattoed girl needs to mind her own business and the girl who went so far out of her way as to make things harder on me are all invaluable wastes of air. This store sucks.

I was harassed by these imbeciles as they wasted my time in their store from the moment i walked in and upon having extra care difficulty at check out, my cashier cancelled my purchase, confiscated my cart and my products, held them in a line of four customers (i was in self check out for a reason) so i excused myself momentarily and informed my cashier i needed to step outside and gather my account info (without bombardment) and upon reentry, waiting in line(again), my cashier had failed to produce my items taking longer than my two
minutes in their doorway.

Needless to say, my extra rewards expires soon and i wont be returning.

Oh well.<//text>< pics>

Usually, a CVS like this would be perfectly adequate. It's dingy, the parking lot is terrible, and the employees are less than spectacular. However, across the street is a Rite-Aid that offers a better experience, and just a little further down the block is a Walgreens that betters both the CVS & Rite-Aid. I've been frequenting this CVS since it was a Sav-on, Osco, and then Sav-on again, and while I may have a more critical eye than I did in my youth, this place has certainly seemed to go downhill.< /Text>

This a review solely based on the pharmacy. I recently came over with a pretty bad virus, and was in intense pain. I struggled to stand, walk and sit. My Dr prescribed me some pain medicine . The prescription was electronically sent in. I get to the pharmacy and check in at the drop off. The guy at the computer let me know that there was nothing for me. I asked him to double check, he said "nope, nothing". I called my doctors office and had them send it again. Went back to the guy about 10 minutes later to verify. Still nothing (he claims). By now I'm delirious with pain and frustration. He looks again, finds my prescription and proceeds to tell me my insurance won't process it cause this prescription has already been filled and billed. I'm in shock, I have nothing! THEN he says, "oh, I guess its already been processed". He retrieves my meds from the back. Moron. I won't be going back to that pharmacy ever.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Basically something more than a pharmacy. Cookies, medication, hair dye, facial creams etc. Very complete and with an excellent price. I like to receive CVS advertising in my house so I find out about the offers. Thank you!!!!

Básicamente algo mas que una farmacia. Galletas, medicamento, tinte para el cabello, cremas faciales etc. Muy completo y con un excelente precio. Me gusta recibir publicidad de CVS en mi casa así me entero de las ofertas. Gracias!!!!< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Pesimo service if I could give zero stars we left the hospital we went straight to the pharmacy for medication I was disengaged in 15 minutes and alfinal left with that if you do not have my boyfriend identification of California you can not give us the medication we never went past so we will never go back always ivamos and the person who treated us very badly faced the staff of pharmacy are for washing an emergency better ballan to another place very bad experience. Here you can find everything and it is good but if you need some medicine better do not come I do not recommend it They need trained and friendly staff

<Text>AVOID WORKING HERE AT ALL COST!! You get NO HOLIDAY PAY, NO VACATION, NO SICK PAY! And you have to pay for All your insurance. There are no benefits. The contractor, Pro-Unlimited, does nothing for you! Certain Managers Sleep with their employees and get them into leadership positions for sleeping with them.A other managers do not care! Pro-Unlimited does not care either. They say you can work from home and give you all these Fantasies at the beginning but in reality they just say that to get you in and make you work and then give you the bad news later. They only hire 1 or 2 a year for full time employees and everyone else is a contracter. They have an "Urgent Hiring" because people are quitting left and right after seeing all the stuff going on behind the scenes. Lots of conflict of interests.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Gap Inc Direct is a GREAT place to work! You get to choose your own hours! You get great medical/dental/vision benefits (if you're full-time)! You get 50% off of Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy merchandise! AND you get the opportunity to work from home!! If you're looking for a job with stable hours, friendly co-workers, supportive supervisors, and opportunities for growth, this place is perfect for you!</Review><rating>5</rating><Name>Chidi<//Name><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1534396097482< /date><Gmap_id>0x809b22487fb59429:0x10c9159241af91bf< /Gmap_id></record>

Wow. Outstanding service. I am in shock at the level of service I have received from this call center. You know, I expected to be routed to an offshore call center somewhere in Asia, but I did not expect to be answered by a local center, right next to Western Sierra Collegiate Academy. Amazing!</review>

<review>Was interested in an interview here. When I received the call from their recruiter it was like speaking to my 18 yr old daughter. No professionalism, seemed uninterested. Probably because the pay is weak. No thanks.<//review>< Date>

<GmapID>0x809b22487fb59429:0x10c9159241af91bf<//GmapID><Text>*****Gap MUST listen to this call, it was before 4 pm on 11/21/17 ******.  I called to get 2 transactions fixed. 1st of it was Gap store's Incorrect info given that the promo is exact same as in the store so go online to make purchases since they were having sys prob at the store. Then I got a run around to different ppl including the wait time. !st the call went to india to a wrong dept, like how? then there was disturbance throughout the call, couldnt hear clearly but didnt want to hangup and dial again to waste time. A customer is frustrated as its not customer's fault to get through ALL this. Its Gap Store ppl and then the online ppl  who are rude and dont even provide their city/location in case the customer doesnt see the required changes had actually been done or not. *******Emily******* did not even give me the state name where there call center is located !! and she sais she is fixing my problem "as courtesy" ?! It was your GAP's employee fault to give me wrong info then how come it was a Courtesy?Then her Manager Debbi just told me that they r in California n later told in Northern CA but still wont tell me the city. Its not a Big deal, but why wont to "satisfy" the customer by making them feel secure with their inquiry . Over the phone we dont know who we r talking to, and where they r located, if they actually have fixed the problem or not. These things do happen in life and customers are the ones who not only get some incorrect done in their accounts but also had to keep calling back and forth so we NEED to know if The Customer Service is lying or not. And the least a customer can do to avoid this situation is to have that rep's name and city written down. I mean what anyone can do with JUST a 1st name and city??! GOD ! Not only *******Debbi********* "The manager" Refused to give me that info (debbi took her sweet time really long to transfer the call to her manager hoping i'll hang up)but even "her manager" **********Nancy********* refused to give that info by saying ,"due to security purposes" THAT IS A LIE . A customer has the right to that "least" info from the call center. Either u give your first and last name or you give your first name and the City name. It is NOT a Company's Policy to hide that info otherwise why dont ALL employees say the same, some give info some dont. I asked Nancy tell me what Security are you talking abt? With this least info what ANYONE can do?  She said she does not know (!) If you dont even know then why u SAY it?! After dragging she told me they are the only calling center of Gap in CA, north of sacramento. Then I said but thats not what anyone told me before. She did not apologize neither she said Yes they should have told this. She just kept asking rudely what else can i do for you. I told her you didnt apologize or said ur reps should have said that, 1st "satisfy" the customer with the 1st question then ask for 2nd one which again you wont satisfy then why ask, just for the sake of asking? Wonder who made you a manager, you dont even do these Basic things. All "these managers" were pumped by their subordinates before talking to me and were already not ready to give the info etc looked like. They had NO humbleness for being a  part of "Customer satisfaction" management. She was so arrogant and rude she didnt even say have a nice day etc etc etc(!!!) and just stopped talking but KEPT over talking whenever I was talking.  So I asked her to hang up as I want to give a review abt her over the phone(as it was automatic after the rep hangs up u can rate them) but she did not hang up the phone !! not even after abt "half an hour" !! This is How a GAP manager's Attitude and personality is! Wow , she KNEW she was HORRIBLE thats why she was afraid of her rating. SHAME. Shame on GAP's customer service.</Text><time>1511303602687< /time></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Ryan Eberle</Name><time>1615057482117<//time><Rating>4< /Rating><text>Great park. Large equipmentneith swings and multiple slides. A smaller kid section though it's a little sparse. Lots of concrete picnic benches. Large amount of green space with some medium sized trees. Shade is common but lacking on the equipment. 1 tennis court and 2 basketball courts, and a baseball backstop.

Beautiful park for all sorts of team sports, young kids, and families. Picnics a must.

Biggest downside is lack of a public restroom.</text>< pictures>

Used to bring my kids here yrs ago. It's a clean park with lots to do for the kids. No restrooms or bbq's, but there are tennis courts,  a lot of cement tables and a water fountain.</Review>

<Text>Fr. Anthony, the pastor of Christ the Redeemer Church, is an attentive and welcoming priest. (I love his inspiring homily). During every Sunday Mass, there is always a welcoming message for new visitors and seminarians. Blessings are given to kids under 18,  those having birthday and couples having wedding anniversary. I also love the community.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

My beloved parish. Great Catholic community, open and comfortable. Friendly and welcoming. First parish I've officially joined since I moved from Boyle Heights in 1991. Fr. Anthony is new to Christ the Redeemer; we're blessed with yet another kind, smart, easygoing pastor.</text>

Quick and Friendly! The attendant George was super friendly! Helped me with storage box suggestions. After my purchase he offered to help me get items to my car. Super nice guy!!

I was going to rent a unit from another location after I packed. After my experience today. I'll rent my short term rental unit here at Saf Keep Storage.</review>

Best storage community staff you won't find anywhere else. Since my things have taken up residence there longer than I want to admit to, the one person who stands out is Marshall. I have dealt with him on many occasions and each one has had a positive result. His service is always excellent, efficient with a perfect follow-through record. Thoroughly knows the business and will answer all questions needed to make sure your time with Safkeep is the best!< /Review>

Very friendly staff, good promo deal, but regular prices not so great. Free truck use and even a little unloading help! Though the rules clearly state that  people are not allowed to live there, I am fairly certain that there are people who do.

Edit: Management did call me about about this review, and expressed concern about my comment indicating people living on the property. She is addressing these issues immediately.< /Text>

<Review>First let me express my deepest gratitude for the outstanding service that i receive.from staff at Safkeep storage on Winton in Hayward CA
Also I would like to commend. Mr. Marshall Bailey, the Assistant Manager at the Safkeep storage in Hayward, CA for going above and beyond his duties at the storage site. For example, I had a problem with my lock on my storage unit and Mr. Bailey helped me resolve the problem.  I give the SafKeep storage in Hayward a 5 star. Mr. Marshall Bailey is an amazing assistant manager.<//Review>< Name>

Hate this place, units are old and expensive. Their schedule is whatever they feel like. Lost a weekend side job (worth $1300) cause they closed on black friday without notification other than a piece of paper hanging on the main gate and couldn't get my tools out. Personnel is underqualified to attend urgent matters and hand out info.< /text>

Safe Keep Storage personnel are so helpful and go the extra mile to provide excellent service to their customers. Reasonable rates and great security monitoring to give you peace of mind, and they have perks that other storage companies don't offer. Highly recommended.< /review>

Just recently rented a unit. The space is clean & well lit- feels safer than other storage places I've been to. Rates are reasonable. Only possible down side is closing at 6:45 or 7:00 pm- if I could I would have later access hours. No deal-breaker obviously! Oh and the staff seems very nice so far.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>By far the best customer service I have ever received from any business in the Hayward area, not just storage companies. The staff was patient, cheerful, welcoming, and overall a pleasure to do business with. I would recommend this to all of my friends and family. In a time of online coupons and faceless interactions, it is great to know that you can still receive professional and cordial service from our local businesses.</review>< pictures>

Found Saf Keep Storage on line. Checked rates against several other storage places, and they had best prices for the size I was looking for. Booked online. Went to office when they opened. Lindsey made it easy and quick to get paperwork done. all units are ground floor. No stairs or elevators. Staff friendly and helpful.</Review>

I needed a space to store a some equipment and FABRICS. These people were absolutely wonderful in dealing with my needs and gave me the perfect storage unit at a great price. They are friendly Helpful, knowledgeable and I  got a free rental truck as well. I would recommend  SafKeep Storage for anybody that needs a well kept clean SAFE Place to store your possessions.</Text>

<Text>They didn't bother to ask me what I was doing when they observed  my husband's friend pull up to our unit and leave 20mins later. Mind you, I was going through boxes to locate a hard drive and RAM for computer he needed help building.

What manager did was, call my husband into the office a day later and ask him if we are still together or having problems... and had maintenance guy there to go on to tell him they observed someone come to the unit when he wasn't there and leave 20mins later. WTF?!

Also, the police are always there, they randomly park down rows and post up for however long.

The People who run this place discriminate, are bias, and have faulty business practices. FACT: certain people renting units will be allowed in early or are able to stay all day- yet we were told not to be in our unit for long as it is considered loitering.

I asked to use bathroom at 6:30pm and the maintenance guy told me "No, I just cleaned it & we are closing in an hour, go to jack in the box". I AM  NOT 100%,  but aren't businesses required to have bathroom available during regular business hours to pregnant and disabled? Nonetheless, save your self the stress, drama and money, DO NOT RENT HERE!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>
{'time': 1562012210721, 'text': "Jessa, We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback and apologize for the experience you have described. At Saf Keep Storage, we aim to provide peace of mind when storing your belongings, so we keep a great rapport with the Hayward Police Department and welcome the occasional patrol and police training they conduct on our property. You're right that some customers are allowed extended access, as this is an extra feature available to business customers only, after they've applied and successfully complete a background check. All we ask is that our tenants follow the rules and regulations and that there is no residing or loitering in or around the storage unit. To maintain its cleanliness and proper usage, our restrooms are closed outside of office hours. We would like the opportunity to discuss your experience further and are hoping you could stop by the office to speak with the manager. Thank you."}</Response>

In the roughly 5 years I have been dealing with Saf Keep Storage in Hayward I have not had any issues with the site or the staff at the site. I was able to get use of their moving van without any problems
The staff has always been helpful and courteous to me.</Review>

<review>Today was a wonderful day giving the past few weeks that my family have endured. I needed to put some things in storage because we just experienced a fire in our apt we lost everything. I called extra space storage and spoke with Tracy  who was very polite, well spoken ( Yes Mama, No Mama ) made me feel old but I'm guessing that's how he respect customers as well as maybe employees if so he did a well good job and made me feel like I've known him my whole life . I began to tell him my story and he said I can come down and he can help me out he began to ask me how long I might be  I said maybe an hour hour in a half the most, reason he asked he wanted to be on duty to help me as he hasn't had a lunch, him saying this to me made me feel like I'm priority and he's willing to take action when it comes to customers. When I arrived and entered the building I'm greeted with kindness and professionalism as minutes pass he set me up with keys given I didn't have my original they were lost in the fire he gave me a tutorial on the lock and it was well understood that he loves his job to go above and beyond. As we proceed to the locker he cut it took a couple of drill bits but it was knocked out and I was able to get into my locker. Tracey thank you for giving me A1 service I would want you at all the extra storage spaces with your professionalism that you've shown me in the little time frame that I had. Thank you a job well done on your end keep up the good work< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Nisha Tackwood< /name><user>113591138662418803605<//user>< time>

< Review>
I just got a storage space here. I've only been here for a week so far but the property is large, clean and  convenient. There are elevators and dolly's to carry your boxes to your units and the customer service is great. Luis, the property manager took the time to walk with me to show me the space and property. I would refer this storage to others as well.< /Review>

I have 2 storage units here and it is convenient to get in and out. The staff is friendly and helpful. My only issue is that seemingly somewhat often they are raising my rents which is a bit tacky and has me thinking of utilizing a different company. I am not saying that they shouldn't raise rates but it felt like they have done it at least twice this year. One more time within 6 months and I am out of here.<//Text>

I helped a friend move her belongings into a storage room here. This place was about as good as can be expected. Fairly clean, seemingly safe and a friendly staff. I haven't had experience with other storage facilities so I can't compare. But I would say you probably wouldn't be disappointed coming here!!! 😎</Text>

<Text>Let me tell you about this place. Its amazing!! if you are looking for a self storage for the low low this is the perfect place. Luis was awesome and inviting. i inquired about the storage at 9 am that morning. I didn't show up to get a unit until 5. Luis knew exactly who is was upon entry. the environment was welcoming and chill. Luis provided me the best bang for my buck when choosing a storage. This was my first time purchasing a storage unit. Luis made this process easy and painless. i could easily give this place 10 stars.<//Text>< UserId.>

<review>Kay, thank you! The facilities are clean, safe and in great condition. I've rented other places before, and never did they have a dumpster for customer use. Extra Space Figueroa/Gardena does. The office is inviting, and the ladies in the office at this location, are friendly, knowledgeable, extremely professional and customer service oriented. They were consistent, in this behavior; each time I called or went in for help. What started as a difficult move, turned around for the better, once I reached they're facilities. Many thanks for the last 6 months of service.

<text>they were extremely helpful and flexible with my issues and requirements for what I desired in using their facilities. They professional, polite and replied to my many questions with direct answers plus a couple of solutions on the spot. That was so different than the half a dozen other storage establishments I've visited, and the three I was transferring from to consoled ate  here with a unit the size I really required and not three small ones with extremely high ceilings to qualify the unit's dimensions advertised. The thing was the cost of renting three different sized units was rediculous when I was able to rent one that suited my needs at a fraction of the price. More so were the little things you weigh in seriously when renting from my formers. First was the elevate that I had to move In & out of. Half the time it took two people to get the doll's wheels to clear doors ever changing wide gap between building and elevader, sometimes requiring more than a few minutes but a lot of wasted energy if moving this cart load alone on one floor and your partner on the other. It became out of the question when a cart load of my manuscripts & expensive vintage guitars & amps  became trapped when the elevate just closed it's door and decide to cease operating over the three day weekend I had chosen to rent a fairly large u-haul truck which was still over half full & the crew of young neighborhood friends I finally gathered for two of three days went out the window. The elevate they said return in the morning 6:00am which only to read a sign scribbled & taped to the front gate that was now also not working. I had no choice but rent the closest vacant storage unit quickly that could fit my truck load that load & three to follow. Yet the main perk I found was the open hours of EXTRA SPACE STORAGE from6:00am to10:00pm each day when the others offered only 6-6:00pm weekdays & closing at 4-5pm weekdays. It seemed I was franticly desperately trying not to lock in at 6:00 & left to fend for myself. Now I'm allowed to manage my time to actually pack & store neatly & organized and load my Truck in a silly rush, then race to get to storage through all kinds of traffic only to get unloaded & hurry stacking best as possible all like some marathon where if you take too long you're held hostage till you call the main office to send someone. You all can easily tell how stressed & remain angry to this day. I am so sorry and apologize wholeheartedly. Moving by a certain time is stress enough storage shouldn't make it worse & felt like more obstacles were thrown in your way you must jump through constantly. But at EXTRA SPACE I now find it a pleasure each time, I don't have to hurry, the staff lives on sight so I need not worry about security plus they set me up with a suggested outside roll-up wide locking door unit, now I can just pull up, park & unload without many steps which is vital with an aging squire as myself now pushing 64 yrs. All in all you could not rent from a more accommodating group and establishment. I was just want to add Luis is awesome<//text>< rate>

< review>
Michael was so easy to work with in selecting the size of the storage I needed.  He kindly pointed out the available units with me just in case I need to upgrade....which I do....Michael made moving and storing which is a pain in the rear, totally bearable, even pleasant.  I must add, Extra Space Storage has awesome gate hours and I so appreciate the earlier than normal 6am open hour to the very late 10pm out time.  Makes life a whole lot easier Extra Space Storage does and I thank Michael and associates very much.  Especially for finding my keys I have been missing for a few days.  Thanks!</review>

At the first glance the building was sketchy to me but once Luis gave us a tour. He immediately ease my concerns and made feel that my stuff would be secured. I definitely recommend this facility make sure to ask for Luis you can tell who he is by his dimples . Hehe</Review>

<Text>Bad Bissness!! I saw a internet promotion. Based on location that I needed, went in my lunch break to rent the unit, saw it did the paperwork, got the keys for the unit, submitted my information but when the credit card was being processor computer couldn't process it for some unknown reason.
The manager who did the process told me that I had a 24 hours pierod to finish the charge and my information will be in the system having it reserved. The next day I go in before the 24hrs pireod to complete it and the unit has been rented to someone else. I called and spoke to the lady on the phone she said she couldn't do nothing but only offer me another unit they cost more than double to rent.  Bad Bissness !!!<//Text>< userid>

I don't advise no one to store there stuff at this location right here. Their security system do not work and they leave the doors so open 24 hours where anyone could just walk in and break into your unit I have contacted management and corporate showed them videos and pictures of proof and still no one help me resolve the situation or refunded me my money for the inconvenience several months that I would there< /review>

I picked extra space storage because the lady who takes new customer's was helpful. So we went there and met ester, we love her she was so helpful and put us in the perfect unit. Ester also took us to see the unit, to make  sure it was large enough. All in all a very pleasant and safe place.< /review>

<Review>In the past it was the best and currently SADLY is now the worst facility do to living  onsite employee I have EVER encountered. I've been here for 8 years and been thru a lot of diifferent employees that have lived on site. Hands down the current man who lives on site is absolutely horrible to deal with and I will be happily calling to complain to his manager about SEVERAL EXPERIENCES involving him and his extremely LACKING attitude towards myself and other tenants COMPLAINTS TOO HOPEFULLY there will be a change bc I PAY FOR STORAGE NOT POWER TRIPPING ATTITUDE!</Review>< pictures>

I needed extra space for things my family and I didn't have room for around the house anymore. Extra Space Storage was perfect! The manager on site drove us to lockers that would be available to us. We chose the locker that best fitted our needs and the paperwork took minutes! The manager was helpful and efficient. It was easy and now all of our stuff is stored away and can be accessed at anytime. With the code to the gate, we can always add to our locker, or take something out. I'm very pleased with this facility, it's clean, easy to get things in and out and if you need anything you just press the little button and help is on the way!< /Text>

<Text>This place I liked first because it is closed to my work and I can pick up my boat and go sailing very easily.  Klide who helped me with location of parking area and application process was very helpful and polite.  The whole process took about 20 minute and I was out the door.  I would recommend this place to a friend.<//Text>< UserId.>

My storage unit was broken into twice...first time i wasn’t able to “prove” it was broken into yet i was missing a few items, the second time the theives cleaned me out. I was able to receive some compensation but def couldn’t replace all was stolen n that’s partially my fault but there are no camera, no alarms..pretty much no safeguards..go elsewhere< /Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>"Great experience signing up with Extra Space; friendly staff helped me get set up with a great move in rate". That was the "nice to meet you & hoping for the best" review; but as that pre-mature review was pretty much coerced out of me by their staff, even before it was due; this review is now being CORRECTED with the truth!!!
I was baited & switched by these people; they were nice enough to start with but that's how they get you! When I saw how much they padded my bill I was outraged! They practically doubled their quote! Then added their expensive insurance even though I already had my own! First off! I never got to move in! I was in their facility to sign up, and came back 10 days later to close the account due to them playing fast & loose with my money!
Deceitful practices is the reason why I'll never do business with this shady company again. They did me wrong! They OUT RIGHT stole my money! Hiding behind their extremely unfair corp policies that are only in place to keep OUR $$$ in THEIR pockets and out of ours! Zero compassion! No humanity whatsoever! It's bad enough I had just been run over and crushed from the waist down, by a 4 tones van just a couple months ago, just recently out of the hospital trying to recover. This is a great example of how greedy companies hide behind corporations that cannot be held accountable & therefore get away with criminal behavior. We need to change that! DEATH TO CORPORATE AMERICA!!!!!! It's time for them to change the way they do business and put the customer first as it should be!!!< /review>< resp>

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE

Cottonwood Heights, Utah

Dear Mesdames and Messiers:

I am the lessee in connection with the above-referenced storage spaces.  I entered into a written Lease Agreement with your company I was provided with a copy of the Lease.  I occupied two storage units, which contained all of my worldly possessions and those of my daughter.  Due to a purported failure to make rental payments totaling approximately $2,000, the contents of my storage units were auctioned
The purpose of this letter is to raise a number of concerns and issues about your company’s handling of my account and my communications with you.
1.Although I was provided with a copy of the Lease Agreement at the beginning of the term, I do not currently have a copy in my possession.  I repeatedly asked members of your organization to provide me with a copy, and on each occasion I was refused;
2.I never received any “rent due” statements from your company;
3.I never received any “past due” rent statements from your company:
4.I never received ANYTHING in written form from your company at any time whatsoever after I signed the Lease;
5.	The reason that I did not make the rental payments is that almost immediately after I occupied the units, I found rats, roaches, and other vermin in the units.  I reported the condition to the management, and nothing was ever done about it.  I have photos and videos of this condition;
6.	Although I was informed verbally over the phone when I inquired, I never received any type of written notification from your company as to the auction date or that my contents would be sold;
7.	After I was advised verbally that I had 48 hours to remove my contents, I was not advised that one way in which I could delay the auction would be to sub-let my units to another individual.  Instead, it was necessary for the individual who purchased the contents to pay an additional $500 to rent two new units into which to transfer the contents.  That additional $500 expense should not have been incurred.  In theory, the 3 additional days to hold the property in the current units could have been prorated based on the base monthly lease amount;
8.	Having been advised orally that an auction was to be conducted, I contacted the Manager at the facility, and requested that I be provided with a few extra days (beyond the 48 hours) to remove my items, because it was raining heavily on February . I further advised your company that no responsible moving company would move my contents during the downpour.  My request was denied by Luann
9. was never advised that I had the ability and right to attend the auction and bid on my own property. which i could have attended legally
10. I contacted your company and asked them to provide me with various written documents pertaining to my lease of the units, and I was told that I could not have copies of them and Nothing. No surprise
10.	At one point during this entire fiasco, I was told that I was “trespassing” on the company’s property, and that police would be called, thus preventing me from being present at the auction.  I want to ensure that when I return to retrieve my property, that I will not be treated like a criminal trespasser and that I will be allowed to peaceably remove my property. Luann called the police on me even though there was nothing in the Extra space policy's stating i coudnt attend otherwise. Luann was nasty and rude to say the least.
In summary, I feel that your company has not conducted itself in a professional manner, and you clearly violated numerous laws and due process procedures in connection with rental spaces or leasehold interests.District manger Michelle Gomez & Luanne need more than company training, customer service but in human compassion.

I am down here from Montana and spent the first 4 weekends looking for a good place to wash my pickup
This is the first place that has hot water everytime as well as soap everytime. Not to mention big enough bays to accommodate a full size pick and easy to get to.
This is my 3rd weekend using it and will us it every weekend the rest of my time here< /text>< pictures>

Ive gone to this car wash for years, but they have a credit card swipe now.  Supposed to be $3, but I just checked my credit card and it says im being charged $10 for one car wash.  There is no website or place to complain to.  What the heck!!!  DO NOT use your credit card here!< /review>

< Review>
This is the You Do It Car Wash, not the someone else do it car wash. You will be required to do it, and those who do not or can not do it should not come here.

It is meant to be done here, and the one who is charged with the doing of it will inevitably be you; lest there be any confusion on the subject of what is to be done and who is meant to do it.

Oh no my friends, it is not for others to do it. Only you...only you can do it: on this field of auto-tonsorial valor provided by the owners of this fine establishment.< /Review>

Do it yourself. Good place to wash & vacumn your filthy car. Bring at least $15 in cash, not coins. You need to purchase their tokens in order to use this carwash.<//Review>

This place has had some improvements over the past year but I've been in avoiding stall #1 due to low water pressure, now I will be avoiding stall #2 because the pressure washer is leaking where it meets the hose and a good deal of that water will come down onto your shoes, as has just happened with me right< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><text>Token machine is made to make you pay more than you need to.  First I went, it didn't take quarters so I drove to the bank to get ones. Then, wouldn't you know it, it doesn't take ones either. 5-10-20 only, and a car wash costs 6, so you'll be left paying a minimum of $4 extra.
It only has 4 options Spray, Soap Spray, Soap Brush(which drips on your head and slaps against your car), and Wax.
You get 4 minutes for $6.
They didn't have trash cans that I could find.

But really, what other options do you have? The next best thing are $20+ options about 10 min away.

I think the only reason this spot is still in business is because they have no competition.</text></record>

Has been renamed, sorry I didn't make note of it.  Requires tokens,  instead of quarters.  6 tokens minimum, for 4 minutes.  40 seconds per token.  The changers only take 1 and 5 dollar bills.
I don't know if the token system is to deter theft, but one consequence is wasted extra tokens and a little extra profit for the business.  I can't fault the facility, it's clean and functional,  but the tokens are a hassle.<//Text>

Place makes you purchase tokens. We all know why they do that and it's just shady business.

Doesn't accept credit cards.

Not sure if it was just a windy day but it's like a wind tunnel when washing, got really wet. Great for drying, though.

No minute warning, clock just stops and then you have to pay another $3 in tokens. Very short duration for what you pay.

Soap spray didn't work.

One of the bays didn't work.<//review>

<Text>Important Info:
Self serve means you do the work. Tokens Required. Machine turns quarters, $1, $5, $10 bills into tokens. 1 token = $0.50. Machine next to token machine offers Blue Towels (I needed 3 to fully wipe down my Honda) and I believe interior wipes as well. Washing Options: Water pressure is great! Foam brush, (that may have scratched my car..written in experience following) Rinse option, Wax Option, and one other I cannot remember. Did not use vacuums at this time.
My experience:
Went on a Saturday morning.
I would give 5 stars but the machine I used are some of my tokens...sorta. I spent at least 8 minutes using my key to unjam my tokens from the return slot. Bummer. Also, I realized the next day that my car had swirls of scratches from the brush I used to scrub my car. I'm not sure whether to blame the brush or how hard I scrubbed.. (My car was so filthy!) Other than those two experiences, I didn't feel rushed when wiping down my car at the vacuums and cleaning it out. I spent at least an hour and a half on that. I went early and people came and went...didn't look like they had to wait to get started on washing their cars.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Good enough for a quick wash. Among the lowest rated places I have ever gone for a self wash EVER. Be fast though because they gouge you badly. They have turned most of the settings off, and they take a long time to transition from one setting to the other compared to ANYPLACE else I've ever been (which uses up your tokens / time). It took around 40 seconds for the soap to stop coming out on the rinse setting. That's a good deal of money / time wasted. The only reason I say it is good enough for a quick wash is because it is in the neighborhood, otherwise, go somewhere else. Shame on the ownership for letting it get this bad and continuing to rob their customers. You could do so much better with so little effort.<//Review>

Spotless. Affordable prices. Great selection of washer sizes. Kids area. Adequate seating. Vending machines for laundry products and snacks. No public restrooms. Wheelchair accessible. Attendant on duty. Drop off service also available. Drop off dirty laundry and have the attendant wash, dry & fold for $1.25 per pound. One of the best laundromats I've ever seen!< /Review>

<time>1550451704034<//time><rating>1<//rating><text>New Review :
The place has gone WAY DOWN. A dozen plus machines are out of order. No working sink nor restroom! I guess they are changing the name / company, I'm told, to a Dirty Bird? But no evidence of the change, still has the Super Suds sign. Wow, what a disaster. Oh, and the washer prices have gone up, I guess to offset the "Free Dry" which are only a few of the dryers. There are only 8 roller carts now too.

I'll be heading to the Tower District Super Suds, where I have been going. Only came here to see a friend of mine at the same time.

Old review :
Always clean with an attendant on hand. Lots and lots of machines so no waiting. Free Wi-Fi.  Be nice if had more top load washers.<//text>< Pictures>

<GmapID>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82<//GmapID><review>I purchased my bike on 5/29 and still have not received my shipping information. On 6/2 I received a call where I was informed the bike I ordered was no longer in stock, but a smaller frame was available. I was then told that the bike would be shipped out the following day and I should be “on the look out” for an email. On Monday June 7th after numerous phone calls I was finally able to speak to an employee who told me he would reach out to the shipping team regarding my order and I should once again “be on the look out for the shipping email. On June 10th I reached out once again and spoke to another employee (possibly the same one as before) I explained again how I reached out and was told on 2 separate occasions I should receive my shipping email but and was told AGAIN, I should “be on the lookout”. Today is now June 16th and I STILL have not received my shipping email. This is beyond ridiculous as I have been extremely patient as I understand that it is still a pandemic and I am on a different coast. I would just like to either receive my bike or have my money returned to me so I can take my business elsewhere.< /review>< user>

<review>Before purchasing a bike through their website, I called with some questions regarding that bike. They answered all my questions no problem. With that being said, I then purchased the bike and it got shipped to my doorstep the very next day. Great customer service, super fast shipping. Will purchase more bikes again from here.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I have recently purchased a 55cm Golden Cycles fixie bike from mrbikeshop.com. So I got it put together and I was super excited to start riding around my city. I have only taken the bike out on two occasions, and both times I only rode on smooth, even pavement. When I went to go on my third ride, I noticed that my tire was dead flat and discovered a massive crack in my rear wheel ( the crack is causing my tire to leak air). My hopes were to receive a new rear-wheel or at least something to help cover the cost because to simply put it the product failed after two used when it was used exactly how it was intended.
So anyway, I tried calling the store phone number, and immediately got sent to a machine stating "Your call is very important to us and due to high traffic we cannot take it at this time but there's no need to call again as we will quickly return your call." or something along those lines and I left a message with my info and they never got back to me. The next step I took was emailing them with what I had to say and attached pictures and proof of purchase; it has been about a week and still haven't heard back from either the phone call or the email. Tuesday this week, as a last resort I DMed their Instagram page and actually got a response, but since I have explained my situation they have been silent and not respond while being very active in posting Instagram stories and continually posting on their timeline.

Save yourself the time and disappointment and buy your bike from somewhere else. 0/5 for the product and 0/5 for customer service.< /text>< pics>

My friend bought a bike from this company. I wouldn’t recommend them. She has problems communicating with them. I build her bike and found out the pedals were missing. Both rims were damaged from the shipment. I wouldn’t be surprised because the box was damaged. She has been sending them messages and calling them but no luck. I feel bad for her because im the one that send her here to buy her bike. I don’t know how they have 4.5 star rating. 🤔</review>

Mr. BIKESHOP
Bicycle sales and repairs
This establishment has a wide array of bike needs. Although it’s located a little bit far for me it was worth the drive.
My son was very happy with his birthday gift. He selected a blue Elite BMX .He was very excited to have made this purchase. I will return to buy my bike with the basket on the back!
Customer service here is excellent the individuals are willing to answer all of your questions and provide you with information to assist you in making the selection that’s the best fit for you.</Text>

Great service. Took in my my mom's bike to get two flats fixed and walked out with a nice commuter bike. I definitely recommend this store for repairs and if you are looking for a reasonably priced bike. These are the kind of small businesses I like to support.<//Text>

<Text>This has been the most frustrating online purchase experience. The advertisement said they would ship the same day of purchase....didn’t happen. At no point did they contact me to inform me that the package wasn’t going to get to me. They have no idea what’s going on. I emailed them about two weeks later, Mayra said she’d would send a new order that same day and we would get the wheels in 4 business days. She said she would send me another email as soon as she send the wheels that same day....no email. Till today, no email yet. Called them and the guy who answered had no idea what was going on. He told me he would call me back the same day I called, no call. 20 days In, I call back today still no idea. They don’t even know if they have the wheels on stock. If you don’t have the wheels on stock, why would you advertise them with the promise of same day shipping. And yet alone, let the customer order it. I wanted to surprise my son with those wheels for his Bday, and I tried helping small businesses. Now I’m waiting on an email where they are going to let me know if they have the wheels or not. Hopefully I get an email....I want my money back ASAP. This is the worst customer service experience I’ve had. The least you can do is keep your customers informed. Don’t advertise false information. Wrong way to do business.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Not sure if in-store service is better, but, online service has LOTS of room for improvement. After submitting a transaction twice for glitches in their checkout service, been NEVER able to reach someone on the phone to confirm the purchase. Have tried for few working days on regular business hours but nothing.

I even tried to email and been days without an answer. Sadly, the reviews online were true, poor customer service.  Hope this reviews motivates a better effort to improve.</Review>< Pictures>

Worst customer service ever. I paid for a bike on April 19th, I still haven’t received my bike or an email updating me. I have called the shop 4 times, sent now 4 emails, and this is my second review. I haven’t received a phone call, email, or anything. I’m at the point I’m going to call my bank and get my money back. Obviously this shop doesn’t care about customer satisfaction.</text>

This is a bicycle shop for people who do not know bicycles. They are way overpriced and their work is not professional. The place is run by kids. The place is for kids. I would not bring a high-end bicycle here for service. Give them your bike at your own risk.</text>

I put an order in April 9th, so it’s been 2 weeks now I have received no shipping update on my package what so ever, I call everyday no answer, I’ve emailed them multiple times no answer, I spoke to someone yesterday who told me they sent it to fedex & Will Contact me back which was a lie, I called fedex & they said they have not received anything from this store, very unprofessional & I feel like a scam if your ordering online. This is a terrible business & should not be advertising items they cannot fulfill & not even answer the phone regarding your the status of your purchase, they also have my number blocked as I call now & it goes straight to their fake message machine.  DO NOT ORDER / PURCHASE FROM HERE<//Text>

<Review>ABSOLUTELY AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Ordered an Unkown 29" bmx a little over 2 weeks ago.  Received the bike pretty promptly which was great considering I live in VA and the shop is in California.  Normally I would go to a local shop to make a purchase like this but considering inventory is lacking everywhere.  After searching the internet for weeks I came across this shop which had bikes in stock. After assembling the wheels, bars and seat I realized the sprocket was moving.  Checked the sprocket bolt to make sure it was tight.  Sprocket was still slipping.  I'm not a bike mechanic but it seemed like something was missing from the whole crank/sprocket/axle assembly.  Sent multiple emails and left multiple voicemails with zero response for over a week.  I did send an Instagram message with a video and explanation of the problem and got s response saying "Could be the bolt holding the sprocket in place. Sometimes it comes a bit loose from factory. That’s why the bike should have been assembled by professionals to ensure everything would be intact." I didnt assemble that part so GTFOH!  After getting the run around I went to a local shop and paid MORE MONEY for them to confirm that a spacer was missing  from the whole setup and fix it.  Mistakes happen.  How you  handle those mistakes speaks volumes about your integrity as a company.  Proceed with caution if you order from Mr. Bikes.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Terrible, buyer beware! Ordered a bike, 4 tubes, a bag and a set of tires. Received the bike, 2 tubes, and the tires (which I had tried to change but never got a response). Never got the bag or 2 of the tubes. Emailed multiple times, tried calling several times a day. Never any response. Had to involve my credit card company. STAY AWAY.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Not too many people here.  Many unknown, throne and fit bike Co.  To come across.  Friendly greeted and good service. If you want them to do labor work they'll do it for you to and additional 10 charge or if you wanna do it yourself they'll let you borrow they're tools at no cost to you. 😁< /review>

< Review>
I was looking for a fixie bike specifically and came across this place online. On my way back home after a meeting, I decided to stop by and check the place out. I think I got there around 7pm and they close at 7:30pm. I left around 8:30pm with a brand new bike that they put together for me. Tested it out over the weekend and I could not be happier. I wish I got the guys name, but he was super helpful and really helped me choose the right bike. No sales pitches, no rushing, humble, low key store that has a bike for every price range. I'll be coming back next week for some additional bike stuff I'd like to add.</Review>

<Review>Company was great when it came to taking my money and getting order out in a timely fashion but when the bike showed up damaged (not their fault) they couldn’t care less about either exchanging it or providing some sort of discount. Reached out a total of 5 times after the initial discussion w/ a representative and not a single response.<//Review>< Pictures>

Terrible customer service. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT buy with these guys. That includes buying on the website. Everything on the website is out of stock. Will not ship for months, with or without covid. They will not pick up the phone, they will not return your calls. Best thing to do to get threw is to call repeatedly over and over. I called over 300 times for my order over the span of 100 days. When i would get them on the phone, they would just tell me to call back tomorrow....I canceled my order 3 times with these guys. I know they are the best place to get a fixie in LA but just dont do it. Trying to warn others that dont have a spare $800 to be held up for months on end with no hope of getting a return if they wont pick up the phone...<//Review>

<review>Outstanding customer service! I visited the bike shop one day before purchasing a bike.  Jimmy answered all my questions and he was very knowledgeable about bike features.

What I appreciate the most is that you can pay with a credit card here. No need to visit a bank to pay with cash like at other places

Absolutely love this place! JR was helpful when I had any questions. I bought my bike from here today, and I'm glad I did. He even cut down the seat and replaced the inner tubes! I will definitely do anything bike related at this place. Great prices too!</Text>

<user_name>Chris P< /user_name><time>1613419578480<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I placed an order on their website over two weeks ago. I received an email saying that the order was confirmed and have heard nothing since then. I’ve called them once, and had to leave a message which they did not respond to. I’ve now emailed them twice and received no response either time. Buying from them locally may be a different experience but would avoid ordering online.<//Review>< Pics>

Best company I have purchased with. I appreciate the service and support I received. I ordered my bike and within 24 hrs, it was shipped. I contacted the store later in the evening and still received assistance, you don’t find that too often so thanks y’all.

Only con is the bike didn’t come with the scan code or instructions. I was able to look it up.<//text>

Placed an order on May 8th. Received an order confirmation, but nothing else.

Sent an e-mail about a week after placing my order to see what the status was. No reply.

Finally called last week and spoke with someone only to be told the bike I ordered was out of stock and my order was cancelled. However, I was informed that they would be getting more in a week and I could “try to place the order again”. Cool.

I’ve been checking the site, but nothing has changed.</Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>After placing an order on this same model of bike in the color "Summer", a week later I was notified that suddenly the bike was out of stock. It wasn’t out of stock when I ordered it but suddenly it was now. I was disappointed, but they told me they had the bike available in "Misty Blue" and I told them to go ahead and send that one to me. Upon receiving the bike, which was in a LARGE box sitting on my porch after the FedEx guy just dropped it there without notifying me, I opened it up to put it together. There were no assembly instructions to be found. Before you say that I should have taken it to a professional bike mechanic, understand that there is a pandemic and I was pretty confident that I could put it together myself (and it came with tools to assemble it, which implies that you can do it yourself). However, no assembly instructions made this VERY difficult. So I emailed Mr.Bikes and asked if I could have some assembly instructions so I could put my bike together. No response after two days, when they had no problem responding right away when I told them to go ahead and send the bike in a different color. So at that point, I decided to go off of the photo of the bike and common sense and put it together within 3 hours. I must also add that the screw to adjust the seat was too short and had been stripped, so I had to go out and buy a new, longer screw to even be able to ride the bike at my adjusted height. It’s been a week since emailing them for assembly instructions and still no response. But I certainly got an email asking me to review my purchase. I wasn’t planning on it, but since that was so much more important than sending me instructions to assemble the bike that wasn’t even the color I ordered in the first place, here I am, leaving a review. Thanks for the bike Mr. Bikes but also thanks for the most minimal help imaginable. Proceed with caution, to those who are interested in purchasing a bike. These people do this a lot, and worse. Look them up on the Better Business Bureau, you won’t like what you see.<//Review>< Pics>

My bike was flat and had a small leak that I couldn't find. They gave me a very good price and took care of my tire. I got a brand new tube very affordable and fast. Definitely do business with these guys.<//Review>

<review>I ordered two BMX bikes for my kids and they absolutely love their bikes. I placed my order on 4/15 then got worried that I may not receive my order after reading some of the reviews. I immediately emailed them the next morning to make sure that what I ordered was actually in stock. It took a while to get a response but after sending a few messages and calling, I got a response that one of the bikes wasn't in stock after all. I was able to switch my order order something that was actually in stock and received the bikes on 4/27 to Oregon. As long as you verify that the product you want is in stock, I highly recommend ordering from Mr Bike Shop.</review>< pics>

< Review>
With the pandemic in New York City, using the Subway is not very safe so I decided to go back riding. After a few days researching I found this website it looked promising. The design of bikes were outstanding for very reasonable prices. Not only that, they are offering “order today, shipping today” or something like that. I was very excited waiting for my bike, I download the app to track my shipment. Everything sounds fantastic.

After a few days (4) I realized the status of my order didn’t change. I call and they said it will be shipped that day... nothing happened. I sent a couple of emails through the weekends with no response. I called on Monday (8 days after my order) and they said they would call me back but they didn’t so I called again.

They promised again it would be sent that day... NOTHING! I called again today (9 days after the order) to find out that the tires that they were waiting for are there but now the frame is missing.

My order got canceled and my refund is pending. Whoever that was dealing with my case couldn’t be bothered to give me any other options so at least I could have had a bike sent to me. I never asked for a discount either a refund. I wanted a bike delivered, in exchange of the money I paid...

No f***s given!<//Review>

My experience with this bike shop makes me feel like I’ve been robbed. We ordered two bikes on the 22nd of April. Almost a month later, and we have not received tracking or confirmation of our order. My bikes are still not here and when you call you get brushed off or there is no answer. This shop is irresponsible and does not take care of its customers. They have more time to post on their social media pages than to give their customers updates. When they finally responded to us all the said was “sorry bro we don’t have your bikes in stock” Unprofessional, zero customer service. If I can rate them a zero I would.</Text>

<Review>So terrible!! I bought a bike 10 days ago and I never got a tracking number. I then called the store 7 days ago and they said they had already shipped my bike and was going to arrive today,Thursday April 23rd. I didn’t receive my bike and I called again and the store said my bike is still at the storage. How professional! 👎👎👎 I was so happy to get the bike that I wanted and now forced to cancel my order. I’ll never wait more than 10 days to maybe get a positive answer!<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Sergio is hands down the most humble and respectful employee I’ve meet since I’ve been getting parts for my bike there or just asking questions on what I should do to it doesn’t give you attitude or negative comments because you ask questions and questions and drive over a hour to just to get treated with respect is worth the drive and also he has a clothing brand which has amazing stuff.....< /text>< rating>

Oh man oh man. This place is awesome! Honest and comprehensive bike maintenance performed. They did a great job reviewing the options for modifying my fixed gear and recommended the cheaper option in the end. Would totally rec to anyone from beginner to experienced. They do not talk down to anyone (I was listening to other conversations with random people walking in). Awesome staff!<//review>

The seat was loose...alsmot ate it because it leaned backwards on a bump. The brakes were loose. The inly reason they have good reviews is because they give you fron and rear light's if you give them a 5 star rating....horrible place....dont waste your money here .<//review>< Pics>

Placed my order on July 3rd, yes its before a holiday weekend. But on the 6th I am told it will ship the following day. Now, on the 9th, after callong 3 times and emailing 4, I am told they can take up to 5 days from the day it was sent to processing...so 5 days is really atleast 6 or 7 maybe?

I have yet to receive tracking. I hope my parts will be shipping soon. I will most likely not be a returning customer.

Edit: July 17th. My wheelset arrived. All rest of my parts are not showing shipped. This company is not worth giving business too. They also will not answer a phone and give you awful service via email.

Edit: July 18th, other parts of my order were canceled. Company website will show stock but its not, its on back order for atleast 3 week. That would put me over 5 weeks for parts with little to no contact from the company.</text>

<Text>I ordered fixie wheels online. They took a long time to finally ship and when they did it took them a long time to get to me. Wheels are as promised though so I can't complain too much, the spokes were a little loose but they were shipped so I didn't really expect them to be perfect.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82</Gmap_id></record>

These guys are AMAZING! They were so helpful and accommodating and one of the only bike shops that still has an amazing selection to choose from.

I bought a cruiser, toon it home for a spin and decided it wasn’t for me. They don’t do exchanges or returns, but took care of it. When I came back, the bike I’ve been trying to find for WEEKS had just come into their shop!

They have so much (well deserved) business and are building bikes on site. Actually kind of cool to watch. All of the guys who work here were so cool with all of the patrons even though they were CRAZY busy.

I’ll definitely be back! Coming back soon to get my son one of the BMX bikes.

Also, Kevin and Sergio are the friggin’ bomb!<//Text>

<text>I ordered a fixed gear bike from them on July 3rd . I received the bike on July 8th  when I opened the package I found out the bike was missing a break handle bar I sent various emails letting them know I never received the handle no one has ever responded. I had to call the shop a couple of times finally I got someone to answer on July 10th and was promised that my handle would be shipped out on the following Monday . I am still waiting for my handle and it is now August third . Do yourself a favor don’t buy anything from them. There customer service sucks and all they care about is getting your money .<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Horrible communication, they dont reply any messages, emails, voice mails.

They messed up the order and forgot to send the bike, they over charged the value of the wheels for the customs.

It seemed too good to be true with their social media really well done. You think that they care, but sadly they dont.<//text>< Rating>

I highly recommend coming to this bike shop. The prices are reasonable the staff here is friendly and always greet people. The staff here knows their stuff. They have a wide variety of colors for rims, I don't live to far from here so this for me is a plus. And you can see it from the bus and a car.</text>

all the reviews about the shipping are so true bro. I placed an order on June 5th and today is the 19th and I haven’t got details on where the hell my order is. I called on the 17th and they said my one of my items were out of stock and if I wanted a different item. I agreed only because they said my items would arrive Thursday, the 18th, and of course you can guess, they didn’t. So much for “same day shipping, 1-5 business days.” These guys are so full of it and don’t care whatsoever for their customers or their concerns. I suggest going in to buy whatever you need because otherwise they gone rob your money and keep delaying your delivery as it was even shipped out from the shop anyway. Absolutely trash.</text>

Ordered a bike that they never had in stock so I pre-ordered, waited patiently for 2 months. Then when they did get the frames in sent it off to someone else when I paid for it months ago.. now working on month 3 and still trying to get my money back... DO NOT ORDER.. if you want a bike from here.. GO IN AND PERCHASE IN PERSON<//Review>

I was a little "iffy" at first due to the negative reviews about online ordering. So I called FIRST to make sure the bike I wanted was in stock. The gentleman I spoke to said yes we have about 20. Therefore I ordered my bike and it arrived 5 days later to NYC. No complaints here at all. Thank you 👌🏾</Text>

don't waste your time on them. they won't reply to you. After contacting them, they couldn't get me an update. Unprofessional in my opinion. I will never come back again. They ended up canceling my order still waiting on my refund.</review>

Worst online buying experience I've ever had. I purchased 2 bikes online, they had them in stock and shipping was 1-5 days. I called 2 days later, they told me my bikes were in the store and would be shipped that same day. One week passes by and nothing. We try calling them, the phone would ring and go to VM. We emailed multiple times, did not get 1 response. We sent them messages through Instagram and nothing. After 3 weeks they responded through Instagram saying yes we shipped your bikes, 30 minutes later, another message saying sorry we don't have your bikes...

How they run a business, I have no idea. The sad thing is I had people reaching out to me after seeing a comment of mines on their post saying they are having the same issues. We all teamed up to get some answers so we began commenting on their social media post. What did they do? DELETE all the comments and still not respond..

If you can't provide at least a bare minimum customer service you should not be in business.< /Review>

This place is horrible. I purchased a crankset online and their “warehouse” sent the incorrect one. I go in store to try and exchange and they don’t have any. So I return it for a refund and they give me the run around after attempting to reach out multiple times. I have never dealt with such an unprofessional business. Will be contacting BBB to resolve this issue and hold this shop accountable<//Text>

$760 Online Order placed on April 20th still has not shipped (May 22nd). We called before ordering to confirm availability and expected shipment times and they said they would ship the next day. They called on April 22nd to confirm our order and we were told they would ship it out on the 23rd. This was the last we heard from them.

Multiple attempts to contact the store have been made since April 30th when the items still had not shipped via email/voicemail/instagram DM have all gone unanswered.

If it is a matter of them being out of stock on the item, I would be okay with that,  but it needs to be communicated in a timely manner to the consumer. I withheld the negative review for 3 weeks to give the company time to respond to my multiple attempts during the pandemic as I understand things are different right now.

Please advise.</Text>

This place has the worse customer service ever. I paid 50 dollars to fix my bike just to get a flat tire the next day They weren't trying to help me out, they wanted to charge me more money on top of that just to fix it again. I think they rigged my bike on purpose it just doesn't make sense and they have attitude like it's my fault for their poor quality materials and service. I don't recommend this place to any of my biker friends who live in the area. In fact I'm telling everyone this business is the worse. The employee with the green eyes has no respect.< /review>

Came inside, right away got offered help by Sergio in helping me find the first bike I ever got, great service for first time and really helped me out by recommending me what type of bike I got. Quick and friendly service from workers, they really know how to attend a customer. Most definitely would come for future purposes and as well recomend anyone to get their bike here!!< /Review>

<Text>This place scammed me for almost $600. Revived a confirmation on my order which said I would be notified when the bike was shipped out. I never received a shipping confirmation. I called to see what the issue was and they told my some bs that they were waiting for my wheel set to come in. This was about a month in. I sent numerous emails and got not reply. Each time I called they gave me the same bs answer until they eventually stopped answering any of my phone calls. All of this happened over the span of 5 months. Eventually I had to file a dispute with my bank to try and get my money back. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE, THEY WILL SCAM YOU.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82</gmapID></record>

Love this shop, I have a couple bike stores closer to my home in downtown LA but I keep coming here. They have a good selection of Fixed Gear bikes and parts plus you can't beat their prices. I've already purchased my second bike from them. They gave me a $25 student discount. Thanks Mr. Bikes!< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Like many other reviewers before me, I had a less than ideal experience with Mr. Bike Shop. I purchased a bike online on 4/10/19 and I promptly got an email confirmation of the order. The email said a notification would be sent when the bike ships and thus, I waited. About a week later, I hadn't heard anything so I called, but only got voicemail. Another few days went by so I called and emailed, no response. I probably called a dozen times over a dozen days and heard not a peep back. On 4/22/19, they sent an email saying the order was cancelled without any sort of explanation. Maybe their in-person retail experience is different, but their online presence leave much to be desired.<//review>< pictures>

ABSOLUTE ONLINE SCAM!!!

I didn't listen to the other reviews and had faith I would receive my order with no problem.  After 141 days (and counting) I have not received a bike or a refund.  I am now going through the process of trying to recover my money.

If you think calling helps it doesn't, the only way to get a response is to call back to back like a psycho ex-girlfriend.  Even then you'll get an earful of lies and zero action.

Someone suggested this shop so I made a 2 hour drive to see the hype. Raymond the shop owner did solid work with a super clean Throne bike! Definitely worth the trip.</Review>

<review>Ordered my fixie parts half a month ago, they didn’t tell me it would be delayed. I emailed a week later they said it would go out that day... that was a week ago. I called twice this week and both days they said it would go out. It hasn’t. Thinking of filing a fraud dispute by next week because this seems like a scam

The saga continues! They shipped an order that wasn’t what I ordered. They took a box and wrote the color I ordered on it and sent a different color and different type of wheel... they haven’t shipped my seat or crank set. Filed a fraud report and left them a voicemail with those details, only then have I heard back. They still haven’t given me a shipping label to return their wheels. So if you don’t have your things call your credit card company and file a fraud report!! Don’t wait more than 30 days though</review>< pictures>

Exellent shop, great customer service, brilliant location. This bike shop has it all, it's well stocked. I had been wanting to visit them for a while now. I came to visit family and I just had to stop! I bought a bike that I really liked, the salesperson was courteous and professional. I will be taking my bike back with me to Chicago.< /review>

Ordered online weeks ago for my sons 10th birthday. Disappointed little boy with no present arriving. Have sent emails, tried calling and now have American authorities looking to follow up. Appears they are already under investigation.
Spent over $600 New Zealand dollars and received nothing.
Absolutely appalling service. FRAUDSTERS.
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SHOP.< /Text>

Cool Shop! I wish I had a Mr. Bikes in my city. I got my Throne Track Bike in 8 Days not bad it was really well packaged so no issues during transit (Thank God ;) I previously ordered some bars from a different vendor and received them dented and scratched (packaging sucked). So I really appreciate the time and effort they took to make sure my bike was secure enough to have a safe travel :). It was super easy to assemble, I give you guys 10 stars. Thank you! Keep up the fu*&^% good work!</text>

Nothing good about this bike shop they got about 10 persons working but have you standing at the door for about 40mins before they ask you if you need any help. While they talk about smoking and how high they got. And every time they would look at you standing waiting just to tell you they dont have the part you asked for. A waste of 40 minutes..< /Review>

<review>Placed an order on December 16th 2019 received order promptly but received an damaged frame, I contacted the vendor at mrbikes spoke to Raymond and Myra both via email and call shop multiple times. I was told they would file a claim with FedEx. It is now January 17th 2020 and at this point I paid full price for a dented frame. I will not do business with this company due to the issue I had and they have not steped up to makeit right, bottom line paid full price for a bent or dented frame.<//review><time>1579296185786< /time>< user>

Didn't want to order from this shop because of the bad reviews but hey this is a small local business not a huge one like the big mike bikes or performance bikes. I'm glad to have ordered my bike from them, especially since they mostly specialize in fixed or single gear bikes. Had it shipped to Berkeley and got my bike at a quick timely manner.</review>

You should also expect wheels to be out of true and a fork to arrive 1 month later. If you wish to call and ask about shipping information, you should call about 3 times to actually receive the promised information. The prices are great, but It's a trap.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They assembled it there on the spot and we purchased it. Got a great price and also got a good lock for it. My son road the bike out the shop and down the street to where we parked are vehicle. Got home, first time I seen him ride a bike the remainder of that day. Thanks MR. Bike shop.<//review>< Pics>

They have completed there, but still allowed me to pick my own frame, wheels and bars for the same price as the completes. Definitely recommend this place.</review>

<Review>Took my son to check out the bike shop, he asked for a Neo Chrome frame colored 20” BMX bike, they just got some new frames in, they found the one he asked for, he got so crazy for just the bare frame that was still in the packaging . They assembled it there on the spot and we purchased it. Got a great price and also got a good lock for it. My son road the bike out the shop and down the street to where we parked are vehicle. Got home, first time I seen him ride a bike the remainder of that day. Thanks MR. Bike shop.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Text>Ordered a bike online from these guys and instantly got a confirmation order but nothing else after that. After not receiving anything after a week I was told by a representative over the phone that my bike was to be shipped out later that day. However it was not. A few days later I pulled up and questioned them as to where my bike was. The guy I believe his name was tony, called someone at their warehouse and said they couldn't seem to find it and they didn't have the white one (Aventon Mataro). But they still sold me the bike. They are known to sell inventory that they don't even have. They take your money and will hold onto it until you go and do something about it. In the store they were able to get me a different and actually more expensive bike at an even exchange. Good customer service in store, but online is sketch. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. Only reason I got what I paid for is because I am local and was able to pull up on them.</Text>< pics>

DONT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY! first of all it took forever to ship my bike. Didn't ship me my grips and that took months to get my return. And the worst thing is they didn't complete my order, they forgot to ship my seat and seat post. They never answer the phone so for this company they should get 0 stars.. Horrible customer service! Dont waste your money on this bike shop and go somewhere else. I got ripped off and so will you!<//text>

The costumer service is great, their prices low and have excellent products. Really nice guys here. They didn't pick up my call the first time, so I guess they were busy. But I got a call back immediately right after. They treated me with respect and are really helpful with my questions about my order. For the inconvenience they threw in a free U-lock and lights. That made my day, and I would like THANK THEM!!! I would recommend buying from here. I for sure with in the future :). Hope you like my review!!!<//review>

Ordered about a month ago still hasn’t arrived and they don’t answer the phone. Their customer service is terrible I would not recommend ordering anything from them. I’ve called 20 times today and they have only answered twice with little to no help.</Review>

I live in France and bought a bike on the website. After an email confirmation of the order, nothing else. Is it possible to contact me to know if shipping in France is possible? On the site, the status is: Unfulfilled. Thank you. Aymeric<//review>

these guys are crooks.  i spent 400$ on an aerospoke.  they never called to mention that they didnt have one in stock, so i called one week later when i received no confirmation or mention that the didnt have one and they offered to send and encore wheel in its place (to their defense aerospokes have been discontinued and was hoping maybe the listing was new old stock).  i received my wheel 3 weeks after ordering and it came with a broken hub.  i called multiple times and emailed them to try and get a replacement under there advertised 7 day return policy and they have not returned calls or emails.  im a working messenger and to lose 400$ is totally not right, i have rent, food etc to mind and thats a lot of money.  DONT EVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.  i have a carbon fiber paperweight if anyone needs.</review>

I originally write a negative comment about my experience, but minutes after I did, I was contacted by the company in hopes to make things right. I'm not going to go into details, but I will say the customer service I received, was a complete turn around. They really made things right and made me happy. The bikes themselves are great, even better than expected actually.</text>

Even though i waited for a month for this bike it finally came to me. I originally wrote a bad review but however a few days later it was getting ready to be shipped and in 6 days it reached my destination which is Singapore. Even though they was almost no customer service i still got what i ordered. Like many other customers i didnt receive any information about my bike for that 1 month the only things i got what a confirmation email and a shipping email. Maybe my frame wasnt in stock and they waited for it to arrive before shipping it out to me. However they could really improve their customers service and there are slight scratches on the bottom of the bike but that fine with me. Thank you for delivering the bike<//Review>

I bought a wheelset for my bike half a year ago and still I haven't gotten a respond about the placement of my wheels.
I have tried many times to contact the store but every time I got the a respond from someone they said they where going to contact me and I will get the tracking info soon but half a year as passed and I still didn't get any info or the wheels.
I tried contacting them via the phone and they said that they will contact me very soon.
In conclusion I wouldn't recommend that any one will buy from this store.
( I have added two photos to show that they I have tried to contact them and every time the give me the same respond.< /Review><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2cc66e1bc12af:0xb8a3deec1fe04b82</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I placed my order on a Monday morning and spent 2 weeks waiting for the shipping confirmation when their website says 1 to 5 business days for large orders and mine was not large (a wheel set and brake pads....not a whole bike). I called them 4 times during the second week and never got an anseer or response to my messages. I also emailed them a couple times during that week and again no responses. When i finally received shipping confirmation and the date they were supposed to arrive came.....nothing showed up and the tracking was still saying they were in the original destination. Its been a month now and supposedly i am getting my order tomorrow. Not only do they have terrible customer service (i.e. no customer service) but they also charged me separately for shipping when the shipping said free when i placed the order. Im hoping my package arrives in good condition since i cant get a hold of anyone. Definitely never ordering from here again though which is sad because it was highly reccommended to me.<//review>< Rate>

We ordered a bike, but only received the wheels. We tried to get the rest, but got an endless string of promises that they will ship, none of which were kept. Received a tracking number that says "label generated", but nothing has been shipped with that label. Received an e-mail from owner Mayra Mendoza, promising to take care of things, but of course nothing happened. Buy from them at your own risk. I recommend to look at the "Questions asked" on Google and read comments from all the frustrated buyers who don't get their orders after paying for them. I am puzzled that Mr. Bike is  still in business. Sooner or later their business practices will catch up with them.<//Text>

<Text>Update of my former post:

After 4 months of waiting something from mrbike shop and 30 emails, I received an email saying that my order is cancelled and that I will be refund. But as of today, they have not given me back my money. So this shop is a trap and these people steal money from customers. They are planty of complaints than mine. So I tell to everybody who read this email : Never buy anything to this shop because you will be stolen. I have all the evidences of my purchase (order number 6685) and all the emails I sent in order to prove that my bad experience with that shop.

I baught an Aventon in Mrbike Shop the 15th of Janury 2019.
I'm still waiting for my bike. After several weeks I had some information, but still waiting for'it. The shipping is not ready yet. No more information. Only , a tracking  number but USPS says that my package Will  be available when the skipper provides an update or the package is delivered to USPS.....I have ask to the details of the shipping to Mr bike shop, but no answer to my several e mails since the end of January<//Text>< Pics>

My order gets confirmed 2 week later without my fork no response by email will probably dispute due to the overwhelming negative reviews the 70 mm wheels that did get shipped out  are pretty  bomb though seems like Company is hit or miss.

<Text>alright um. they do have something like problem with online shipping system. Before you order, call them and check if they are in stock,
then u should be fine. but i'm pretty sure it will take about 12days to get it.
and they put some free lights. which costs about 3 bucks for sure but. thanks anyways i'm happy with it(everything is fine with the bike) unlikely other people's review.
and idk if Mr.bike shop did it or Brand did it. they did put free gear, not fixed. it took about 10min to change</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I bought two Fixies for my daughters, they customized them exactly how they wanted while we waited. We are very pleased with our purchase only one problem (parking) but we managed to find one. Thanks Ivan for the great customer service.< /Review>

<review>I gotta say their worldwide shipping sucks they lack communication I called them so many times about when my bike is coming in and then no answer. It’s been 1 month and it should’ve arrive by now. Why do you guys even bother to do worldwide shipping when you can’t even answer the damn phone or email. And send the package within due date. I even heard that someone haven’t got their bike for 4 months already which I’m starting to get really iffy about. I’m going need to get a refund if my bike won’t come within the next week. This company took a big HUUUUUUGEEEEE L.<//review>< pics>

Scummers for online orders. Cant attest to their brick n mortor shop but DO NOT order online. Never answer the phone, no return of emails or messages left  but they charge your card. Order 8723. Scammers. You dont take peoples orders who are buying Christmas gifts for their kids and not respond to their email or repeated phone calls for over 2 days.  Wish I had read prior to order placement.

SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE.

11/30/18 UPDATE:  I involved the bike manufacturer which actually got me a call back.   I was  cursed at over this google review.  Ramon admitted they did not have the bike on hand even though it was on "sale" on their website.  However, I was charged immediately for my purchase.  He refunded my $$ minus a "25% restock fee".   Apparently, they dont know you have to actually SHIP something and have the customer  RETURN it to RE-STOCK it.  So this is the crux of their scam.  They take your $$, ship nothing, then charge a 25% restock fee.  I will get my $$ back from Visa when I dispute this claim,  but this is fraudulent and shows their unscrupulous online "business" practice.

I wish I had read the 77 and counting 1 star reviews that expose their scam ahead and saved myself all this hassle.< /text>

<review>Ordered a frame on 27th of December. Turns out they didn't have it in stock but posted it as being in stock. Then it turns out the factory hadn't even released the frame. After two months of these clowns mucking me about I've requested a refund which they agreed to do. Two weeks after that I've had to dispute the transaction with the bank because they refuse to pull their finger out. If you're thinking about buying a bike from these guys it's be a far better experience to just repeatedly punch yourself in the groin.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><date>1487023925922< /date><user_name>Morgan Daniel< /user_name><rate>1<//rate>< gmap_id>

<review>The worst costumer service ever. Tried to get a part i needed for my bike. Was told by them that it would be in the next day at a specific time and will also call me. Two days later no call. I called and ask if my part was in. They replied.."we got stuff in but gotta check what came in". Third day i called an the same answer was given. I decided to go in person and walked in(keep in mind that the first time i went in the workers were sitting down and on their personal phones doing nothing) one employee was on duty and i asked if he new anything about my part...gave him all the info. All he did was shrugg his shoulders. Employee called the owner and asked if he knew anything about the part. The responce was it was not ordered. I asked the employee what i was told that it would be in the next day. Well he said i just work here. I asked him can i just get my old part back please. He looked for it no were to be found. I ask him to please call his boss and ask if he knew were it was at or pay me the value of my part. He just gave me a business card and said you call him. I just work here. Finally after all the frustration he found it. I will never recommend this lazy good for nothing people and business. Just wondering how in the heck they still in business.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Before buying from them online, please know that I had ordered a bike from them that was discontinued months or maybe a year before. I called them about having no shipping updates(because they didnt have it) and he said they’ll have it by the next two weeks.
Please dont go through the hassle that I went through.

For your information, I had just called you guys two days ago.
Shows how reliable they are.

Got my tube replaced Saturday, didn't ride my bike all weekend. Come Monday I get dropped off at work and then it's time to come home and I find out my tire is flat. Go back tell them what's wrong and dude tells me if I had come Saturday evening he would have replaced it blah blah. How could I have known if I literally didn't use my bike! So he just tells me he'll sell me another tube and charge to replace it. So  not even a courtesy free of charge replacement, I wouldn't have minded paying for a new tube, but nope this dude didn't care. So much for customer service . Never again.<//text>

<review>I ordered a bike online over a week ago. It said it was supposed to arrive a few days ago. But now it just says "pending". There aren't any updates, it says it was never even shipped. I keep emailing and calling trying to reach someone and no luck. I just hope this gets resolved and I get my bike .</review>< Pictures>

Purchased a helmet over two weeks ago on their website. Helmet was never sent & they do not respond to emails. Seeing this has happened to others I believe that this website may be a scam.< /text>

Probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Ordered a bike online from them and it arrived 3 weeks late. When it arrived they didn't include the handlebars, pedals, or grips I also paid for. After calling and sending numerous emails I gave up on trying to recieve the rest of my order and just took the L. Would not reccomend using their online store.< /Review>

< Review>
Before buying from them online, please know that I had ordered a bike from them that was discontinued months or maybe a year before. I called them about having no shipping updates(because they didnt have it) and he said they’ll have it by the next two weeks.
Please dont go through the hassle that I went through.

For your information, I had just called you guys two days ago.
Shows how reliable they are.

DO NOT BUY ONLINE
terrible experience ahead, no reply, no help, partially refunded. I was trying to acquire a bike but once you have pay, the customer service is inexistent no matter the multiples emails.

Customer, try another firm for online buying.<//review>

1st of all the prices are super high then the owner thinks hes God's gift to the biking world, he gives attitude to most of the customers that I've seen walking into the store including myself and I don't think I'll ever go back to the shop again. If I was getting chased by theives and murderers, and he was the only shop open I would face the thieves and murders instead of going into his store that's how bad it is but don't take my word for it go ahead and check it out for yourself.</text>

Very disappointed at the fact I have waited over two weeks for a single part to ship from the shop.
I have called and emailed multiple times, reached out on IG and Facebook to no avail.
They essentially have taken $200 from my account and have no idea where my wheels are.

Unfortunate that I had to do a chargeback through my bank just to get my money back.

Take you $ elsewhere< /Text>

Very good customer service I'm a loyal customer they always give me good deals I bought a inner tube and got it installed for a good deal they recommended me the heavy duty inner tube because the basic ones pop quick I didnt mind the extra labor fee I was a bit upset that they pop randomly depends where I run the bike through but I know Mr.Bikes always helps me out and is always there for my needs ,tires ,tubes, rims etc, overall I am satisfied with there service and great deals< /Text>

Once I ordered the frameset I got the shipment email almost immediately and got my frame from CA to NC in a week even with a holiday weekend in between.

<text>Got my tube replaced Saturday, didn't ride my bike all weekend. Come Monday I get dropped off at work and then it's time to come home and I find out my tire is flat. Go back tell them what's wrong and dude tells me if I had come Saturday evening he would have replaced it blah blah. How could I have known if I literally didn't use my bike! So he just tells me he'll sell me another tube and charge to replace it. So  not even a courtesy free of charge replacement, I wouldn't have minded paying for a new tube, but nope this dude didn't care. So much for customer service . Never again.<//text>< pictures>

Every question I had has been answered by them either by the employees or by the owner him self . MrBikeshop has a variety of options on bikes and handle bars including wheels from different color +more. Customer service is beyond the best.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1453314339164, 'text': "Hello Hazel, We're happy you've enjoyed your experience with us!"}</Resp>< gmapID>

This is the place to be if youre looking for fixed gears. However, they also have beach cruisers. I've been looking for a specific bike for about a week now and the only place who has it is Mr.Bikes. Drove all the way from Northridge. They assembled my bike on 15 minutes. They were kind enough to offer drop bars instead of riser handlebars free of charge. Customer Service is top notch! Will be purchasing my brothers bike here soon!</text>

< review>
My wife & I ordered this online for our son on June 17.  We noticed that the confirmation email & receipt did not have any shipping information whatsoever.  There was no shipping date nor any estimated date of arrival or even how many days it would take to get the bike upon ordering.  So we emailed them via their website that same night.  The following day, we called but no one would answer.  It went straight to voicemail.  What was most bothersome was that we just read the bad reviews online after we have already bought the bike.  So we tried calling several times & then emailed a 2nd time.  We were a bit paranoid by then due to the bad reviews we read about their customer service.  Surprisingly & Amazingly, after just half an hour of leaving a voicemail & emailing the 2nd time, we got email replies to both emails we sent from Mayra & we got a call back from Richard.  They provided us with all information & answers to our questions.
It was a wonderful experience because we got the bike exactly a day after we ordered it.  We got the bike on June 19 & it was shipped & packaged well.  I think that most reviews are subjective & I felt I needed to inform the people too that this Company is great & did everything they could to provide a great experience & customer service.  If you read this Mr. Bike, thank you so much!< /review>

< Review>
Originally was great customer service.  When I ordered my frame, they were out of my size so upgraded me to the newer frame in my correct size. When my tracking number didn't work, I called and only after I called did they ship my order out.  However, when the package came (after twenty days from my initial order) the frame came in the wrong size and with the wrong wheel set that I ordered.  I've been trying to get in touch and finally got ahold over the phone today.  So far disappointed.</Review>

<Text>This company is a con game. I ordered a frame, told it would take 7-10 days because they "didnt have it in stock"& it never came. Thats more than a month ago. I called no answer, sent a email, no response, left a voice mail message, no answer. Once I contacted my card company about the fraud I get a email of a delivery confirmation number a week later only for them to never send the frame. I will let my card company deal with these people hopefully I can get money back but I will be contacting the Throne bike company personally so they know that this is happening with their products. STAY AWAY PEOPLE BUY NOTHING ONLINE FROM THIS COMPANY READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. This is coming from someone who races & would give 0 stars if I could. They may try & call it a scam post but ITS NOT!!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1507476010774, 'text': "Hi, we can't verify your name since you didn't provide it with your review but we do have 1 Throne Track Lord Neo Chrome Frame order with a chargeback that has been cancelled and refunded. This order was placed on September 9, 2017. On September 10, 2017 we notified you of the ETA of this frame which was currently on pre-order. The ETA was September 22nd, 2017 (7-10 business days) Unfortunately the frame didn't arrive until September 29th (which was a Friday) when we announced it on Social Media. (you can confirm this information directly with the Throne Company) We have been diligently processing all the pre-orders for this very popular frame. On October 5th, 2017 we fulfilled your order which was ready for shipment. On October 6th, 2017 we received a fraudulent chargeback so your order was refunded and cancelled and the shipment was stopped. We deeply apologize about your experience (we hope you can understand) all back-orders/pre-orders with an ETA we provide are directly from the manufacturers."}<//Response>

<review>DO NOT BUY BIKE FROM THEIR WEBSITE IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS SITE!
I don't know what took them soooo long to SHIP A BIKE! 14 DAYS! 14 DAYS! 14 DAYS to ship my bike !!!? Plus 6 days of appx shipping time, 20 days altogether, is this how you treat your customers? MrSlowShop get your game up! And they won't pick up the damn phone or reply any email. Extremely disappointed.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Never written a review in my life. With that said this place is pitiful when it comes to customer service. I ordered my bike May 1st after never hearing back or receiving a tracking number for my order, I was told that they did not have my bike and would have more in two weeks. Two months later they still did not have my desired bike and I requested my second refund. One week removed from my refund request and the funds have yet to be deposited in my account. SAVE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY.<//text>< Time>

I have been to many shops and I have never seen guys who know fixed gear bikes as well as these guys. Mr bikes has so much of thier inventory dedicated to this purpose, that no other bike shop can do what they can do for fixies. On one occasion i had a cracked throne frame. They called the company that day and got me new bike under warranty right away.<//Text>

< Review>
I order a bike from here and when it came in, the frame did have some scratches on it, they were minor, but still prevalent. when the bike came in, it was missing a nut on the front wheels and it took me 2 trips to my local bike store to find a replacement. The handle bars came in with grease and black spots that i had to wash off. the bike itself is great, i love it. The only thing is, within a week of riding it, i got 2 flat tires, both of which i have had to replace and gotten new, better tires. this site is great for people who want to get the custom bikes, It took me a while before i stumbled apon this site to get the bike i wanted. So it is great that they have the amount of options and combinations to customize the bike. but shipping could use improvement.< /Review>

<text>I came to this bike shop with my son and place a bike on layaway made 3 payments Witch equal 110.00 my son didn’t want the bike after all I call the place and spoke to a guy that made no sence on what he was saying he said he had to contact the owner Witch is his wife.. never got a call back stop by the store to get my refund and he said he spoke to her and I ask what she said he said “ she said Ok” I’m like about what then I told him in my statement I’t don’t say nothing about a contract or not giving my money back it only states 90 day layaway!! Bottom like the guy was a complete Moran he said he was going to call his wife the owner he took long time on the back and came out saying she did not answer and she is not in town she won’t be back till Tuesday by that time I was fuming!! And I told him just give me 100.00 keep the 10.00 he said when you put a deposit we don’t return it back we keep it but we just give store credit so I’m like if some one gave you 200 you will not give it back as store credit believe me people will be acting the same way as me bottom like he did not give me my money back acted like an ass and making up every excuse for everything made me get a scooter that my son is to talk for it!  My point to this is befor you go make sure you get full details and store policy in writing or they will screw you big time!< /text>< pics>

<Text>DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR ONLINE STORE. Absolutely zero customer service for online purchases, they do not respond to any calls or emails and if they respond to your calls they are completely dishonest and seem to know nothing about their own product. There are mixed reviews on here about their online store - I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and give them a go, but that didn't turn out in my favor at all. Spent $500 USD on a bike but thankfully PayPal has my back and I got a refund after I disputed it after waiting 30 days for seemingly nothing; despite when I did get a call from them (coincidentally nearly immediately I filed the PayPal dispute) they said they 'shipped it' 10 days prior to the dispute and gave me a dummy tracking number which showed that the thing hadn't even been picked up by FedEx. The one thing I didn't get back however was the time I wasted trying to even get a response from this 'business'. They seem to have a legit brick and mortar store but their online store is an absolute scam - worst customer service I've ever dealt with hands down. They are that bad they even let the PayPal dispute timeout (i.e. they didn't respond to the dispute in under 10 days) which then means that PayPal automatically refunds the money to me - if that's any indication of how they run their business. If you value your time, don't even bother looking on their website or even going into their physical store for that matter if they treat their physical business the same as their online business. Even if their aim was to scam me out of my money I'd still give them 1 star because they did a pretty pathetic job at that too.< /Text>< pics>

Their website is a joke, no confirmation email, no tracking, plus the item was not in stock. If I didn't call like five times, to make sure my order was cancelled, I would have never known. Customer service is not a priority for them which is sad and bad for business.</Text>

I did not recieve my shipment in 3 weeks and still not have received it. I called them 3 times asking when am I going to receive it. The first time they said it was going to come on the 2nd week but it hasn't come yet. I called yesterday twice and no answer. I feel like it's a scam because it took a lot of money from me.<//Text>

<Review>I received my bike quickly but it came slightly scratched.  Also the lights and tool kit were missing from shipment.  After contacting them I was told it was sent out via usps but when nothing came I reached out again and was given a fedex tracking number.
I just received my second fixie from them.  Customer service was subpar at first but after a phone call with an associate my bike was shipped quickly. Overall I am happy with my purchase. Just wish they wouldn't hadn't  forgotten the lights again. 😒<//Review><Rating>3<//Rating></record>

guy handed me his tool so I would re-fix what i paid him to fix, cuz he "wasnt the mechanic and didnt know how to fix it". That was BS becuz he told me how to do it! How INSULTING. These guys show little respect and have no sense of costumer service. I'll never be back!<//text>

Don't shop here. They'll block you on instagram in no time for answering someone's question....but can't answer the phone or respond to emails. They'll also let you order lthings that they don't even have in stock. Oh and the wheels they sent me had scratches and knicks in the paint</text>

Not much of a good place to get assistance on bicycles.  They're not really friendly if you have questions on issues like changing a tube on a tire.  I went in there to purchased a Tube and had to return three times because they did not inform me of the part I needed to put air on a DURO Bicycle Tube.  That was allot of time I spent going back and forth.</text>

I ordered an unknown combat bike 9 days ago and we still haven't got any news from them so we called them and they said they were gonna send us a tracking number and we still didn't get anything and and then they sent me an email cancelling my order saying that they didn't had enough space to proceed my order I recommend to not buy from this place</Review>

(Translated by Google) I have already made several orders to the web with shipping to Spain and in all, without exception, the communication has been terrible.
Last time I ordered a complete bike and as usual they shipped it in two separate packages. Well, after weeks without receiving news of the second package, I was forced to contact the store, in search of some type of shipping information related to it. Nothing. When they are not interested, they do not take calls, or SMS, or emails, or messages on social networks. They even blocked me.
Finally, and after using all my energy to get in touch with them, they deigned to send the remaining package, which I received, of course, much later than expected at the time of ordering.
In addition, at the time of receiving both packages, I had to take care of the customs amounts (an additional € 37 per package).
It is up to each one to assess whether it is worth risking money in this way to save a few euros.
Good product, lousy service.

He hecho ya varios pedidos a la web con envío a España y en todos, sin excepción, la comunicación ha sido pésima.
La última vez pedí una bici completa y, como de costumbre, la enviaron en dos paquetes por separado. Pues bien, tras semanas sin recibir noticia del segundo paquete, me vi obligado a contactar con la tienda, en busca de algún tipo de información de envío relativa al mismo. Nada. Cuando no les interesa, no atienden ni llamadas, ni SMS, ni correos, ni mensajes por redes sociales. Llegaron incluso a bloquearme.
Finalmente y tras emplear toda mi energía en conseguir comunicarme con ellos, se dignaron a enviar el paquete restante, el cual recibí, por supuesto, muchísimo más tarde de lo esperado en el momento de realizar el pedido.
Además, a la hora de recibir ambos paquetes, tuve que hacerme cargo de los importes de aduana (unos 37€ adicionales por paquete).
En mano de cada uno queda valorar si merece la pena arriesgar el dinero de esta manera por ahorrar unos cuántos euros.
Buen producto, pésimo servicio.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Mr.BikeShop is by far the most dubious shop I know so far!
First: The online stock is up to date!
Second: The delivery times are exceeded by far!
Third, the goods will not be shipped in their original box, but will be divided into two boxes!
Fourth: The ordered 6ku bike was delivered with scratches!
Fifth: I have been sent a wrong size!
Sixth, luckily every third email will be answered!
Seventh: After my bike arrived, the people of Mr.BikeShop have shown no response!
These were seven valid reasons not to shop at this unprofessional shop ...

(Original)
Mr.BikeShop ist wohl mit Abstand der unseriöseste Laden den in bis jetzt kennen gelernt habe!
Erstens: Der online abrufbare Lagerbestand ist auf dem letzten Stand!
Zweitens: Die Lieferzeiten werden um Längen überschritten!
Drittens: Die Ware wird nicht im Originalkarton versendet, sondern auf zwei Kartons verteilt!
Viertens: Das bestellte Fahrrad der Marke 6ku wurde mit Kratzern angeliefert!
Fünftens: Mir wurde eine falsche Größe zugesendet!
Sechstens: Es wird mit Glück jede dritte eMail beantwortet!
Siebtens: Nachdem mein Fahrrad angekommen ist, haben die Leute von Mr.BikeShop keine Reaktion gezeigt!
Das waren sieben triftige Gründe NICHT bei diesem unprofessionellem Shop einzukaufen...< /review></record></dataset><record>

We're sorry you feel this way I see that you did place the order during our 5 de Mayo Sale which can delay small packages but not by 2 weeks as you mentioned (please refer to our shipping FAQ's).
