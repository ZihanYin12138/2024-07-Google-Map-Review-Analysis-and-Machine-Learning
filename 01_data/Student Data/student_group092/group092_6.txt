<Text>Amazing customer service experience! Plus the beef pho soup was AMAZING, the fried rice was good, the chicken egg rolls was meaty not over powered with veggies super crispy, & the cream puff were delicious. They give you a alot of food & the delivery came in the time that was quoted.

Thank you for the amazing experience & wonderful food!<//Text>< Pics>

Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was excellent. The service was fast. Huge portions of food and very fresh. They do a lot of deliveries. I was stuffed for $12.00. Really good deal.< /Text>

<Review>The food was good, the service was almost non-existent. There was one young girl server who was never around. We had to yell or get up and go find her when we needed anything. Ignoring your customers is not a very effective way to get people to return.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I first ordered here about a month ago and I say it was great because my delivery driver - whom was also my server - walked 1/4 of a mile to deliver me my food with no problem when the gate to my community was broken. The food was still good despite taking longer than usual. The next time I ate at the restaurant itself they provided excellent service and the #21 pho was perfect. Their thai tea is full of flavor and the atmosphere is very simple yet comfortable. I highly recommend this place if you cannot decide on Vietnamese or Chinese, because they have both at a reasonable price<//Review>

<text>First time here, this place is very unique.  They offer western style lunch specials yet offer authentic chinese dish.  If you prefer western style chinese food go with the lunch specials if you want the authentic stuff try the Hainan chicken.< /text>< rate>

< review>
First off it's not the same Pho Star restaurant that I use to eat at since 2016. I would have to say that the name of the restaurant stayed the same. But it's not the same owner nor the same food for the same employees working there. I used to eat there a lot when they first opened in that location and I knew the owner and all of the employees.  I really enjoyed the service and the food there before. I can tell that their menu changed as well as the service. The service wasn't that great it took longer to be seated for a smaller restaurant, the service and the courteous  of the employees wasn't great like it used to be. Why because the service took longer  then the previous owners and employees that used to work there. The foods not the same. They also served me a type of an orange like Boba with a fruity liquid Center which made the Thai tea taste different. They did not use the original black chewy tapioca Boba that's usually served in most bobas today. I was unhappy with my drink for I was expecting the Boba that I used to purchase when I used to go to the Pho Star. I had asked the owner why they serve the Thai tea with that type of boba in it letting me employee know that this is not the way I have ever purchased a Thai tea boba his explanation was that they were out of the tapioca balls and if they were out of tapioca balls he should have came back to the table and explain to me that they were out instead of replacing it with a fruity liquidy boba served in the Thai tea. I usually order the brisket steak pho soup as I noticed that has changed as well it didn't taste the same as it wasn't served the same. All I have to say now is that I will probably be looking for a new for a restaurant to be eating at for I was not pleased with the experience either the new ownership change over as well as a service.</review>

This is my new spot! I've been here over ten times and haven't been let down yet. Their pho broth is fantastic. Wish they gave a lil more meat but for the price it's absolutely worth it and fully satisfying. Their cheesy Ragoons are sweeter than normal but delicious! Their Boba is the boomb. Super soft, so many flavors. Love this place.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I wanted to like this place. It is super close to my house I could walk here.

I started with egg rolls, they were mushy and tasted worse than frozen and then microwaved egg rolls.

There were no plates for sauces at our table, and our server had to check three tables to find some. He brought over three plates, two of the three were dirty. My fiance went to pour some soy sauce so she could dip her egg rolls and try to make them edible and the plastic bottle was plugged shut with old sauce. She had to clear it with a fork and poured the crusty bits into one of the dirty dishes we were brought.
.
The broth spoons at our table were dirty.

I ordered Pho the broth was ok, and that's being kind.  There was more fat than meat in my bowl, and the little bit of meat I got was very tough and not very good. I only could eat a few bites before I lost my appetite, and I am not a picky eater.

I was looking forward to a good dinner, and I was very let down. I often enjoy Pho, and I have never been to such a bad place. The lack of customers, and that someone was passed out sleeping in the BMW M4 that was parked outside crooked in two spots next to the front door should have been a sign.

I noticed that they are under new management, so I am not sure if the positive reviews were from previous management/owners, but I would be shocked if others had a positive experience here.

I left my uneaten food on the table, paid the tab and left. I would have felt bad and awkward refusing to pay for my food even though it was horrible. I will not be back. I ended up going home and cooking my own dinner. Save your money and appetite, visit somewhere else.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Food arrived 1 & 45 minutes after order placed. The wrong order was delivered. When the driver returned with our order, it was cold, greasy and inedible. When we phoned the restaurant for them, to return the food and return our money, the order taker on the phone said "That's not going to happen" and threatened to call 911 if we phoned them back again.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I bought a rebuilt transmission and it came with a new torque converter. I wasn't sure if it was gonna work for my truck due to it being from a newer Year but they assured me it would be a direct fit with out any modifications. I installed it and it works flawless like brand new and there price was the cheapest I can find in the valley. Also included is a good warranty at no extra charge. I didn't have my core at the the time of the sale and they where nice enough to work with me on the price to fit my budget and not leave empty handed. Real good service very straight forward and answered all my questions to my satisfaction, with out a doubt these guys put the customers needs first.. i definitely recommend this place... 👍< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< review>
Blew away all expectations! Paleo-friendly food was bursting with flavor, especially the chicken waffles. It was almost like a mochi-waffle in consistency. The bulletproof coffee  was actually the best I ever had. Super friendly service (Thank you Victor!), and lovely social-distant outdoor seating. Bonus points, there was a Klimt and a _phone charger_ in the ladies bathroom! I would quarantine here if I could. Thank you!</review>

Cute place, I really wanted to like it more but it took a long time for our food and our eggs were cold... there was only a few people in there at the time we ordered.<//review>

Wow. Delicious breakfast! I had the breakfast tacos, and they were absolutely amazing! Would very much recommend you try this gem in Dixon. They are offering outside dining and lots of options for takeout also.</Review>

Staff was very friendly, however it's definitely not a great place for a full breakfast if you like all the extras, but
Its probably more of a dinner& lunch
Kinda place<//review>

Quaint little Cafe, AMAZING FOOD! The staff was kind and attentive, nice atmosphere, a little on the pricey side, and small portions. However the quality of food is off the charts!<//text>

Wow!  What a find!  I had the Chicken and Avocado Salad on Sweet Potato Toast (which was simply a slice of sweet potato.   It was one of the best meals I've had in ages. So tasty!  I Asiago had the seasonal Vegis which was mostly caramelized carrots, onions a little mushroom and a little pepper (like a bell pepper, but maybe a red pepper).  Perfectly caramelized!  I finished with a "paleo" brownie.  So soft, warm,  just the right amount of gooeyness.   It was had a carmalized maple chocolate flavor. A little sweet for me... but maybe that's good l.  If it has been less sweet I would have eaten the whole thing.  As it was a only had a few bites and was then completely satisfied.  Milk would have been a good addition for me to help wash it down. They do serve grass fed milk,  I just didn't get it.  I highly recommend this place.  Its pricey for me but the quality and taste justifies the price.< /Text>

This place was amazing!!
We had chicken and waffles and the Chipotle chicken wrap and both were sooo good and gluten free!! We over heard someone talking about brownies so we asked. The lady, owner/manager, gave us one to try. I thought that was such a nice gesture, makes us want to come back every weekend. We probably will lol. Definitely a place worth the drive if you don't live close.< /text>

<text>Exactly what I like and a breakfast place . . . Interesting and unusual choices that I wouldn’t make it home. Friendly service, clean nice sized restroom, breakfast hot when you get it to your table, and interesting menu. I only gave four stars instead of five because they do not have espresso coffee available, seats are very uncomfortable, the height of the table is very low and you have to go up to the counter to order and pay as well as get your own serving utensils and napkins. Definitely would return for the delicious food.< /text>< pics>

We've been here several times. The food is so good we signed up for their weekly meal delivery service, which is also very good. The only thing preventing the 5th star is the price and portion size. As an example, the steak and eggs is $18, but the steak is only about 6 oz. That said, the steak is wonderfully tender and seasoned deliciously, if a bit spicy for my taste.  The meals delivered are also a little spicy, but they are all made with very fresh and delicious ingredients. You can't miss!!< /text>

<review>We have been ordering Rosemary's delivery for almost a month now and can't say enough good stuff about it. The food is delicious - both my wife and I are foodies and we have yet to find a meal we haven't liked.

The portions are awesome too (coming from a 6'5" 250 lb dude), i never finish a meal wishing I had more - just right.

Their customer service is even better, any issue we have had have been promptly and excellently solved. Heck - Rose even made a delivery herself when we ran into an issue on a drop off.

The meals come in  a recyclable container that are ready to pop in the oven. Just take the lid off - put in at 375 and 12-15 minute later - boom - awesome home cooked meal with tons of flavor and on our meal plan.

Seriously - Rosemary's have given my wife and I our evenings back. No more worrying over who's cooking dinner or having to break and order take-out off plan.

The only real problem is we had to stop ordering the brownies because they were so good we'd eat 4 (they are HUGE!) in just a couple days.

Delicious, nutritious, affordable, and easy. What more could you ask for?< /review><GmapID>0x808525c7bca95275:0xfee18af5bc2e537b</GmapID><UserId.>117663441348192196186< /UserId.><Time>1573701131698<//Time><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Sev Johnson< /user_name>< Resp>

<Text>I have been into the cafe for brunch and had wonderful experiences each times.. tonight I tried the stuffed bell pepper prepared meal and Oh MY GOODNESS! It was AMAZING! It was the perfect meal for me to come to and throw in the oven for 10 minutes (yes! 10 minutes! ) and it was perfectly cooked through- perfectly portioned for me .. I did share a few bites with my husband 😂 .. he loved it too. I am super excited to try the GIANT brownie for dessert!! My husband may or may not get a bite of that 😂😜. I'm so excited to try the meal prep plan.. Rosa has a very high quality standard and it comes through in the flavors and beauty in her meals and amazing  customer service of all aspects of her business.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808525c7bca95275:0xfee18af5bc2e537b<//gmapID></record>

Stopped here on my way to SFO, was glad i did. Small place with a great and different menu, nice smoothies and shakes. Their service was outstanding, we were a party of 7, we called in advance and found a reserved table with our name on it, impressive.< /text>

<review>Welcome to Dixon, Rose - We're truly blessed to have you here!!!

Wonderful, YUMMY food:  Our first time there, we had the Chicken Waffle, Wild Smoked Salmon, and Kalua Pork Tacos.  All were delicious, well thought out pairings with very appealing presentations.  Great coffee, too.  Warm & friendly staff.  Great place to eat and they are a safe spot for celiacs and other folks with food allergies, too.

I'll be back...</review><Date>1578524216258< /Date>< rate>

Nice venue could use better parking. Interior is spacious and easy to use. Full kitchen and plenty of bathrooms. The only downside is parking. Too many reserve spots for businesses in the area< /text>

I have a major sweet tooth and Sockerbit definitely satisfies! They are one of my favourite candy shops, I especially love their sour candies. I've only bought from them online but definitely would love to visit one day.< /Text>

<Text>Sockerbit is a must for any trip to the area! You simply cannot resist the lure of the taffy, no matter how hard you try, so don't even fight it. There were more flavors than your mind can any comprehend. And there's even free samples! If on the off chance, you don't like taffy, there's a wide selection of other candy as well.< /Text></record>

Great old school candies and hard to find Euro chocolates.  I'd give it 4 stars if the owner would sing the candy man song from Willy Wonka.<//text>

When you see Starbucks, don't forget to turn towards Van Ness to check it out.

<time>1524713338706< /time><Rating>4</Rating><Text>Great selection of candy you probably won't find in most places. Love the sour sculls, and chocolate covered nougat. Some of the candy is super hard due to shifting temperatures but ask the store attendant if you are are picking out the sour skulls or corkscrew varieties and they'll help you out. I think most are naturally colored, otherwise they're labeled.<//Text>< pictures>

I stopped in there a few nights ago to kill some time, and I'm glad I did! I had a craving for dried plums, and these are the best-- really sour on the outside, and sweet inside. I also got some dried fish snacks-- salty crispy fish/chip things. tasty!  The quality is great and the store is SPOTLESS... always a plus!<//Review>

A friend brought me in here, and I gotta say, it is a super-legit European candy store with lots of yummy & flavorfull varieties -- if you want a "Candy Sommelier," ask for Aaron, since he LITERALLY knows everything about candy and is a legit candy connoisseur!< /Review>

<review>At 14 dollars per pound the paper bag used to weigh the candy costs you at least one dollar.  Candy is interesting at best, but overpriced. Buy US candy instead, you're better off.</review><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80c2b930de48df11:0x9ef2458e28d4d84c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great time in here with the kids picking out candys.

Very spacious store and attentive staff

13.99 for a pound of candy

They need more Scandinavian products besides candys, some sodas would help, toys and whatnot

It just has a sterile feeling to it< /Text><rating>3< /rating>< pics>

I am European and I know how GREAT our candy is. This store is the best you will find in LA. It is a bit pricy at $12.99 a pound, (trust me I'm a student, I budget EVERYTHING) and yet I always make sure I can get at least 1 or 2 pounds every month 💗 I figure if I'm going to indulge, I only want the best! Go as soon as you can, and while you're there, ask the very friendly employees why Swiss candy is the best!!! I love it!!!!

<text>My wife and I ordered some candy from here as a reward to ourselves after she had been following a very regimented diet and after the stresses of moving into a new place and starting a new job. We had heard really good things about this candy, so we were hoping it was going to be delicious.

The shipping time of the box we ended up receiving was quite timely and the packaging of the candy was very well done and cute. The texture, appearance, and smell were also enjoyable, but for candy that cost as much as it does and that is only sold in two physical locations in the United States, we were really letdown by the resounding "meh"-ness of it. Instead of having unique and interesting flavors (which a few pieces had), most of it was pretty bland and boring.

We'll grant that there were a few pieces of it that we liked, and that taste is a very subjective matter, but we feel that for the price we paid the candy should have been more enjoyable (as candy is supposed to be).< /text><GmapID>0x80c2b930de48df11:0x9ef2458e28d4d84c< /GmapID>< userid>

They also carry some Swedish food classics such as fiskbullar (fishballs, basically meatballs made of fish, in a sauce) and Kalles Kaviar (an odd kind of caviar that we Swedes love to put on eggs and sandwiches). Only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but that's totally understandable.</review>< pictures>

Great place and best prices you can find in the area. The office receptionist is very friendly and bunch of great restaurants just walking distance from the area. I recommend this place.</text>

The owners are to cheap to fix the water lines so our water is constantly getting shut off without notice cuz there fixing small sections at time, the rent is way too high for the quality of life, and it's so hot now but the pool is closed, the washer and dryer are so old you have to put half a load or run it twice, the  manager doesn't respond to any of the issues brought to her attention, and the maintenance man walks around talking to everyone but fixes nothing! I highly don't recommend this place, at the time I don't have a choice.<//text>

I have been trying to get in touch with you guys since Thursday about renting a lot, but every single time (20+ calls) it goes to the answering service which refuses to let me leave a message.

Gave up, they are impossible to get in touch with.<//text>

<Review>I used to stay there frequently and have worked with a couple of there managers and there is pro's and cons with both and to find someone in the office can be a crap shoot as well. With that stated, there are some full timers with some run down rigs, some looking a little shady but never had any problems. Most are pleasant but they do have some overgrown trees that ripped the cover over my roof and haven't returned. I would but fear of damage to my rig.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Called and talked to the female manager to get information about rates and regulations. She was extremely rude and said, "well duh!" When I asked a legitimate question. For not ever renting in a mobile home park, that makes me feel like I'm going to have a nosey, incompetent, intransigent landlord nagging me for everything I do. Forget that! I'll look somewhere else. Don't need to be harassed like that at any place of business.</Text>

LITTLE HELP, PLEASE?

I drove in to Sunny Acres but wasn't sure I had found the correct street address as it wasn't clearly marked from the main road. Luckily I saw an "office" sign in front of me and parked there. I walked up and could see four women in the office through the glass. I opened the door and they all just stared at me. No greeting; no smiling faces. What if I had been a potential new resident?

It didn't happen to be that I was looking for residency; I was just a visitor. I asked if I'd found 1080 San Miguel. They kind of just looked at me and then I received a not-so-friendly affirmation. My next question was directions to a specific lot number. I did get my answer after a moment of silence but they didn't seem happy to help me. There was nothing warm or fuzzy about these women.

The way I see it, you get one lifetime to be the best person you can be. To make life for others as great as possible, and to enjoy it yourself. I just don't understand it when I come across people who are unkind, and in this case, unfriendly!

Smile! It's contagious.</review>< Pics>

Check the reception. Overall they might be not that professional in managing. But the mexican people who live all their live in the park are verry friendly.

I really loved our mexican neighbours. Big shoot out to Junior and his family. Good park , nice pool and enough space for the RV.

You can leave the RV at the park and you can go to San Francisco Downtown by BART (metro). The bartstation is not far. Its walking a couple blocks. Think around 20 minutes. Overall peacefull neighbourhood, didnt had any bad experience

Happy guest.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

<Text>This is a well stocked store and the people are so nice. My sister and I went in to get some new windshield wipers for her car because of an incident with the ones I put on for her. We never did find them. They're some place on the highway. Anyway, everyone was so nice and the excellently nice man behind the counter installed them for us and didn't even charge us to do it. That's customer service.< /Text>< pics>

Great store. They always have what I need. Went in and had my battery checked and learned that it was dead. They were awesome explaining the price options for batteries. I also needed windshield wipers. to my great surprise they came out and installed the battery and windshield wipers for me right there in the parking lot and it is 35° outside! Thank you so much guys and gals. 👍< /Text>

Always attentive and professional. Usually have the parts I need for my 1967 VW Bus. They stock more remanufactured OEM parts for Vintage VW's, at a reasonable price, than any other place in the whole USA.< /text>

The employees are always friendly, and there usually isn't very many customers so it's a great place to be in and out quickly! Pretty good selection, and decent prices too! My local spot for parts and stuff..< /review>

<Text>This store has the worst customer service ever! They don't mind taking your money, but can't come outside for 5 seconds to show you how to apply the product correctly. I would highly suggest going to Auto Zone where they will help you!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Staff was super helpful and had no problem walking me to the isle and help me pick out a part for my car. Oil prices are a little high but no one can compete with Wal-Mart prices. That said, I've ordered brakes and rotors with ease from O'Reillys. Definitely recommend this place.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

There is a small selection of hot, prepared food. (Deliciousness!!)

There is a tiiiiiny parking lot available (4 or 5 cars can fit) that is shared with a restaurant nearby.</Review>< Rating>

<Name>John Smith<//Name>< review>
Was getting my tire fixed at discount tire, so I walked over here for lunch with a coworker looking for food.  Little hole in the wall Salvadorian place next to random stores, also doubles as a little bakery.

I got the Pupusa de chicharrón y queso x2 and a Pupusa de frijol y queso. A Pupusa is a small salvadorian item that's essentially a fried tortilla with stuff inside it. The one I got had pork (chicharron) and queso (cheese), while the other one had frijol (beans) and queso. They're $1.50 each! Way cheap, since they're not too big, so I got three, which was a good portion for lunch. They were really tasty, and crunchy, and cheesy. Definitely a very homely place, and they also have a decent bit of other dishes and aguas frescas like horchata and fresh juices.

Cool little place.<//review>

My daughter had an appointment at 130. They told her at first she would have to wait an hour. We said she couldn't wait an hour. Then they came back and said they could she her in 30 minutes. We said that this was unacceptable and told them this was poor service. They didn't seem to care. Bad experience. Disappointed!!!< /Review>

Nothing but the best experience here! I've been using the services provided from this salon for a while now and each time I've always had a different stylist (mostly due to me being terrible at booking in advanced, I'm always a walk-in). The two stylist that stand out the most are Christina and I believe my most recent stylist was Marcella? I'm so sorry I'm terrible at at names haha. They know how to hire some amazing and talented people!!!<//text>

The staff had no clue we had an appointment and when they finally figured it out, they (with attitude) told us to return in one hour. They refused to acknowledge their error.

<response>None</response><text>Great experience! I made an appointment and asked for whatever stylist would be available. They are open late on Thursday & Friday, so I was able to book starting at 5.
Hans was very sweet and fun to talk to. He did excellent work and got rid of the brass from my previous at home hair touch up. I got a partial highlight and the color is beautiful and easy to manage. Plus, the cost was very affordable. Less than $100 that included toning and blow dry. Awesome place!< /text>< rating>

<review>Lack of experience. If you’re unfamiliar with how to do a style or if you feel unsure or if you make a mistake. Please stop and ask for help. Also please ask what services they would like before charging $50. I wanted a trim. No need for a shampoo and I would of declined had I known how expensive. She chopped the whole side of my head crooked and left me with an awkward cut I would have to go shorter or deal and let it grow out. I’m very unhappy with today’s services.</review><Time>1569880983382</Time>< Name>

Jessika H is an amazing stylist! She knew exactly what I wanted even when I had trouble describing it. This is the best my hair has looked in a long time. She asked many questions to make sure I would be satisfied with my hair color and cut. She took her time and made it look incredible and explained everything she did along the way. Everyone in the salon is very friendly and talkataive, its clean and a very professional and fun environment.<//Text>

Hans my Stylist was Great! I called numerous times to get an appointment and no one answers the phone. If you leave your phone number you won't get called back either. You have to physically go in to get an appointment.</Review>

<text>I needed a haircut right away, as I was going to a function at the last minute. My regular girl was on vacation and I decided to try this place. I got a lovely cut and style and it was perfect for the occasion. Staff is very nice and I like the ambiance.

Horrible. I wanted a specific haircut and the first time the girl cut it not even close to what I wanted.. she dyed my hair but didn't even match the color to what I want plus she didn't even bleach The Roots before she colored it all she did was put the color on top of my hair so had to go back the next day She cut my hair a little bit better but my hair was orange now I have dark roots and it's only been two weeks I would not recommend this place to anyone.. $110.00 down the DRAIN< /text>

Justin was fabulous but you definitely need a new phone person !it’s your calling card and that gentleman fails big time ! My grandfather started our Chevrolet dealership in New York just over 100 years ago, curry chevrolet , which is still family owned with other dealerships of course so I know something about the business ! You have to respect your calling card which is your operator so I suggest you do something about his ineffiency’ it makes you look and sound bad! Had I not used you for the last 10 years I would have hung up and gone anyplace else!<//Text>

Internet sales manager michael kingsbury made my Corvette purchase very seamless and easy there was no pressure and haggling other than the usual tug and pull between two people wanting to get the best price for themselves and there was no hidden fees or internet lies what was presented to me was very honest and straight forward   I was happy to do business with la Quinta Chevrolet  and  I  would recommend them to anyone looking to buy any Chevy not just Corvette s

The gentleman at the counter was very helpful and professional. The only complaint I have was the mud inside my car and on the tires and some on the car. My vehicle had just been detailed 2 days prior and to see all that mud on the bottom door panel and carpet, well I want to happy about that.< /review>

Michael is a phenomenal salesman. As expected it is a fairly long process when buying a new car. Michael made it a wonderful experience. He found me the exact truck I wanted at a great price. I have looked at dealerships all over the internet and no one beat your price. Michael and the sales manager were able to obtain the payments that were affordable for me. Also, the computer signing was a breeze. Great job LaQuinta Chevrolet, you have my business for life! More importantly, I love the truck. Kudos to the GM designers and thanks to all the great people who made buying a new car a pleasurable experience especially Michael who never left me just sitting there. He always checked to see if I needed anything and kept me informed through the process!<//Text>

We would also like to Thank You for your repeat business over the years! Your recent negative experience due to the provided "LYFT" to get you back to the dealership is something we are sincerely sorry about. We do our very best to keep the entire experience positive. The fact that a "LYFT" driver you were provided was less than positive is something we are looking into and will try to stop from happening to any customers in the future. Your feedback is very important to all of us at La Quinta Chevrolet Cadillac.

<Text>Asked Ilene to confirm the price and financing options, which she did.  Although the dealership closed at 7PM and we weren't planning to make the purchase until the following day, we were in an out in practically no time at all.  In fact the test drive took longer than the paperwork.  That's a first for me and outstanding service.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I had a appointment for Tuesday 11/10/20 for 10:30am.  I arrived at the dealership at 10:12 am and was greeted by a gentleman and asked if I had a appointment.  I told him I did and provided my name for verification he then asked if the keys were in the vehicle and I told him yes.  I asked where the restroom was and he told me where it was.  He then asked if I would be waiting for the vehicle i said yes.  He told me I could wait inside.  At 10:30 I noticed my vehicle wasn't in yet and I assumed they were probably running behind.  At 10:45 the same gentleman came into the service waiting area and told me I need to have the service writer write up my service.  News to me as he never said that when I got there.  I went to the service writer and had him write it up.  He then asked if I would like a car wash and I said yes.  He told me my vehicle would be ready about 1hr 15 minutes.  So I figured it would be ready about 12.  At 12:15 still nothing so I walked outside and noticed they were still working on the vehicle as the hood was up.  I went back in to the waiting room until 12:30 and still wasn't done so I went outside again and noticed someone was washing the vehicle.  At about 12:45 I was notified that my vehicle was ready and just sign here.  I was then told that my vehicle was parked outside the waiting area.  I got on my vehicle and went to the store and when I got out the roof of my truck was still dirty and not washed or even touched.  How do you wash a vehicle without washing the entire vehicle.
If you note from the time of arrival to the time of departure it was 2 1/2 hours.   Not one person said anything to me.as to sorry about the delay or sorry about any confusion.  NOTHING
I'm from a different state and thought I would use them for service because of the reviews.  Boy was I wrong.  I've been a Chevrolet owner for over 30 years and have never been treated like this anywhere.< /review>

When you have people like Henry Hodges helping you he makes you feel relaxed. The guy is a great guy to have assist you. He explains what's going to happen with your vehicle and what he tells you he means it. He helps you with what he can in a professional way but still by the books. A person having this kind of service to offer I will return to have my cars serviced with his team.</Review>

<user_name>Michael Lambert< /user_name><review>Upon arriving I stood waiting for someone to acknowledge I was there for about 10 mins over my appointment time. I was advised later that day that the mechanics couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my truck so they contacted gm and would keep me updated. I didn’t hear anything back that day and they kept my truck overnight without advising me. I had to call to get a status in my truck the next day at 2pm. I was then asked what module was underneath my dash that the mechanics found. They had no idea it was a gps for low Jack that was installed by chevy. I was then told they still couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my power steering and to come pick up my truck. They told me to drive it around and if my power steering went out again to just bring it back. Pretty unprofessional in my opinion also dangerous since in 2015 Chevy trucks had this problem and were causing accidents. When I arrived the second time to pick up my truck I again waited before having to walk up to a random employee and ask if I could be helped. Overall not pleased.<//review>< Rate>

< review>
On Sunday 1/31/21, Shortly after leaving on a 500-mile trip from La Quinta to Lake Tahoe with my dog and young granddaughter,  I had a “check engine” light and message come on relating to the exhaust Fluid System.  Knowing the truck would shut down after so many miles I returned to La Quinta to have La Quinta Chevrolet check it out on Monday morning.  I was the first customer arriving in Service and was greeted by Scott Coletto.  I explained my situation to him, and he was extremely sympathetic to my issue and advised me he would get it right in for a diagnosis.  Within a few hours Scott called and advised of the findings, Nox Sensor and Exhaust Temperature sensor.  He assured me it would be fixed by the end of the day which it was.  Scott was extremely professional and committed to helping me get back on the road.  Thanks to him my stress level went down quickly.  Scott is a great asset to La Quinta Chevrolet.

Sincerely,
Robert Bettencourt</review>

If the app would provide more stars, that would be appropriate for my review of this Dealership. It also services Cadillac as well. The team is impeccable at delivering quality services, attention to the minor issues we deam major , and the best part...Once work has  been completed,  your car is  presented back to you following THE best detail job ever !!!

The staff: Lorena, Rosemary, Gus , Daniel , Justin ,
Michael and Nicole are the best! You can see them smiling thru their masks. I recommend this business unlike no other. Even if I had a Mercedes, I would bring it for services and maintenance here.</Review>

The actual guy that I had spoken to was not there to finish the transaction cause of a personal issue.  Like any sale it takes hours to get out of there.  But all in all it was a good experience!! I had actually posted a bad review earlier but after I was schooled about buying a car, I understood I was wrong.  But they do need to explain the actual value of each of the extras you add to your purchase not how much you payment goes up!!! That’s what threw me off and thought I was being hassle.  The credit guy was a nice guy and he was doing his job and explained each extra but not the actual price of each extra.  Only how much your payment would go up! But all in all I do recommend this dealership!!

<Review>Went here because I seen a Buick Lacrosse that was certified. When I got there me and wife were greeted by Miguel Flores. We went on test drive after we returned to do paperwork. Miguel was informed that the car was already sold. So we decided to test drive an Impala. But did not like it.
We thanked Miguel for his time and left. About a week later I would see the car for sale at the dealer using gm certified pre-owned website. I called Miguel to setup an appointment to buy the car. He informed me that he was going to be off the next day. But one of his co-workers would help me and wife out. Wife and me drove out there Sergio was helping us out this time. Wife did credit application Sergio said best apr was 4.99 for 60 months. I informed him that was higher then what we wanted. He informed me what apr was I looking to get I told him 3 percent.
He informed me that not even on new cars he would do that. Bs gm has at the time 0.9 apr on new cars. I told Sergio that for about 40 dollars. More of payment I can get a new Toyota Camry 2020 with 0 apr for 60 months. Me and wife walked out.  Also wife's credit score is 826.
Two days later we walked to our local Toyota dealer an got a new Camry. Thanks to Sergio.
But Miguel is top notch and a great guy. Would recommend him.I guess they would rather send the car to the action block.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9ErA-_3b7BkshN3_5Oed_BqrysKVEAfOAOqvP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>{'time': 1608317181233, 'text': 'Jp,\nThank you for providing us with your experience, We would like to apologize for the negative outcome  from your visit.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We brought in our Yukon Denali for shaking at low acceleration speed.  Henry our service advisor was amazing to deal with a world of expedite and knowledge.  We had tried several times to fix the same issue and all other dealers had charged us over $1100 each time only to have the same issue again.   He was extremely knowledgeable and found a bulletin that is a common issue with this make and model.  He even went above and beyond and contacted GMC to warranty the item and not only we didn’t have to pay anything we got a $1100 REFUND ! I I have worked in this industry for over 27 years and have not ever received such great service at any dealership even though we have dealt with many luxury brands.   We highly recommend La Quinta  Chevy and Cadillac be sure you ask for Henry if you are planning to visit La Quinta Chevy or Cadillac.

I have been taking my vehicles / Tahoe over 20 years and have also purchased / Tahoe from La Quinta Chevy , the service and parts staff are alway so friendly and professional , helpful , explain everything about you vehicle from start to finish , they go that extra mile to make sure your satisfied and understand everything that was done and what you may need on you next service. The Cadillac area  is in the same service department and are also out standing. I was looking to purchase a New Truck next year and trade in my Truck, the sales department was friendly , professional and helpful going over my opinions and no pressure in buying right now .< /Text>

This dealer not only has a great inventory, but a sales and sales management team that respects its customers. I drove from San Diego because of their professionalism, and would buy another vehicle from La Quinta without hesitation. Job well done, Chevrolet and GM need to be on top where they once were, and make America Great Again...< /text>

<Text>I had an amazing new experience at La Quinta Chevrolet.  My past experience in car buying was always such an inconvenience and such a hassle.  Josh was truly a great help and a great salesman.  His concerns for customer satisfaction were amazing.  I never in the past had such a helpful salesperson.  His dedication in setting up my On Star on my new vehicle as well as making sure everything in my new vehicle was taken care of.  They really did give me the best possible deal they could based on my credit.  I was truly surprised at their dedication and smoothness of my transitioning into my new vehicle.  A week later I am still impressed and truly amazed.  Thank you for keeping all your promises and the extras I received.   I love the rewards you offered and I feel as if I came out like a champ and feeling proud to be a Chevy Owner.  I am already and definitely recommending this dealership to everyone,  in the market to making your new vehicle experience a great experience.  Thank You La Quinta Chevrolet and Josh Bott for all your professionalism and making me feel like a Queen.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1563217373930, 'text': 'We are thrilled to hear about your fantastic experience with Josh!

<review>Scott my service advisor is a terrific customer service representative. He is knowledgeable and patient Scott clearly explains the recommended services required. Scott is a valuable member of the customer service team. He is the reason I have my car serviced at La Quinta Chevy. I will ONLY have it serviced at La Quinta Chevy. Their workmanship is second to none.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>Contents of my van I converted to an RV were spilled all over the floor of my van while it was "serviced". Unfortunately I did not discover this until after I had left the dealership and it was closed. The work was done successfully at a decent price but this sort of carelessness without any notice of it or anything done about it is inexcusable. I won't be using this dealership again.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1590615031482, 'text': 'John,\nWe are displeased to hear about your contents inside your RV left in the condition they were.

The people were nice. The showroom was also very nice.  It is frustrating when you have to teach the salespeople about the cars they are trying to sell you.  Maybe that is why Tesla is doing so well.<//text>

josh went over the top to make my mom feel comfortable with her new car. He went to pick up the car from another dealer in the colors my mom wanted rather than talking us into something she would have settled for. He even came in on his day off to be with us when we picked the car up. Awesome customer service!

This dealership is completely satisfactory. I have been talking to Michael Kingsbury about the 2012 Kia Sorento that I bought in Kia dealership at Cathedral City that I went underwater due to big drop of value. I also have bad credit and only have $500 to put down. After dealing with alot of different dealership in Cathedral City Auto Mall including Kia dealership that don't even try to qualify me and they all just turn me away. Michael ask me to come in and he will work with me. The day I came in for my appointment, Michael happen to be off but his there attending other customer that was ahead of me, so he hand me over to Carlos Castillo and right away Carlos did his work and got me testing driving the vehicle I want. Unfortunately it was way above my limit. But him and his boss didn't stop there, his boss quickly go on a hunt and find something that I could qualify for and he did. My wife and I went home with a 2019 Chevy Equinox thesame model in just a lower trim submodel. This dealership went above and beyond and I was super super completely satisfied with the service and hospitaly. The owner of this Laquinta Chevrolet Dealership should be proud of his team. Thank you to the owner, Carlos Castillo, Michael Kingsbury and Dominique in finance and to the lovely smile of the receptionist. You guys got my loyalty and will not go any where else for as long as the people here in this dealership stay this way helping people like me...... THANK YOU GUYS!!!<//Review>

Received a notice from Chevrolet concerning a recall for my vehicle. I made an appointment for an inspection, which revealed that the lower control arms were defective. I made an appointment to return the car for repair under the recall. I checked with the dealership later and was told that the parts were not ordered because I had not correctly set up the recall appointment. I was advised that the parts were on indefinite back order. One nice thing is that the dealership provided me a loaner at no cost.< /review>

<Name>Greg Rangel< /Name>< Review>
Took my truck in for a oil change and had a large repair done. It was ready the next day. They called me kept in communication and it worked out great.  Been taking my truck there for oil changes. I purchased the 3 package deal twice already. Every time ive taken it back been great service. I thought because I bought a deal i would be treated inferior when I came for the next change, Not all. Great service.
I had a different ABS light come on when I left. I called them and they said bring it in. I have yet to bring it in so ill update.  But id recommend.<//Review>

<Review>Excellent service department. The service writer Justin does an outstanding, professional job! The mechanics are top notch! I always look things over when the shops get finished with my vehicles, never found a flaw with this business. First dealership I've come across that washes yoyr vehicle for free with every service they perform. We are from out of state, otherwise I would do all my business with them. Would give them 10 stars if allowed! Thanks so much La Quinta Chevrolet!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1541468035149, 'text': 'William,\nThank you for your kind words about Justin and our Service Team.

< Review>
While it took quite awhile (as it does at any dealership), we were able to drive away in the car that we wanted, for the price that we wanted, and they were even great with the kids while we were busy talking numbers and all. Joseph took time to actually play with our 3 year old that was getting restless and bouncing a ball through the dealership! Wonderful people, and they work hard to get you where you need to be so you can drive home in the car you want.< /Review>

< Review>
I just bought A car 2 weeks later the cue system is non responsive at all times. It need replacement for $1400,
I called you guys 100 times and after 15 days you told me you bought it as is no warranty for anything cuz it used. And I see that’s already happened with many..
but it’s all good. my duty to let the people know who’s thy dealing with.. Be very very careful peapol when you dealing with them cuz once they take your money they doesn't know you after.
And for me I believe in karma I’ll let it call you.</Review>

<Review>Antoine, Armin and Victor were honest, friendly, accommodating and seemed as though they really care. This is something that is very rare when you are shopping for a car. They went above and beyond to make us happy, true customer service at Chevy La Quinta. If you need a car these guys will get you into something that you truly love!

Thank you for the Chevy Spark we love it!

I just bought a used car 10 days ago and the cue system screen is already freezing, after they been call me everyday to buy the car once you purchase it.. they don’t know you. I been trying to reach the sales guy or any manager always busy and never call back!

Don’t even think to deal with them, they are the worst Cadillac dealer I've dealt with so far.< /Text>

<text>Terrible service. We were looking at an inexpensive used Toyota that they had on their lot, so my wife was there to test drive it. Michael Kingsbury and some guy named “Raul” used aggressive sales tactics that did not comport with what Michael Kingsbury described as a “family-owned business” that is always willing to “work” with customers.
Maybe next time, Michael Kingsbury and “Raul”, you can take the time to listen to, understand, and, if you’re really interested in getting better reviews on Google and elsewhere, educating a potential customer as to how the whole process works given their unique situation.
The condescending and pompous attitudes you both exhibited are shameful.
Very dishonest sales staff.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< review>
I am very Pleased with the People and Services at LaQuinta Chevy. I highly recommend them. I have a new 2018 Equinox and there are some paint chips in the body of my new car so I bought a Paint Pen to touch up the areas, but the color didn't match so they refunded my money that I paid for the Paint Pen. They did a good job on my first Oil Change and Tire Rotation.</review>

< Review>
Went into this Chevrolet for the first time since I’m new to the area for a oil change on my boyfriends corvette and as soon as we walk in  we got no greeting, no anything period. Mind you there is 3 employees in the building and we aren’t even sure whom to speak to. After standing there for 5 mins my boyfriend finally speaks out can someone help us? When these people are no more then 5 feet in front of us. One man answers us VERY RUDELY to the point I don’t even want us to help us anymore. Didn’t apologize for having us wait there like we were like if we were bothering them with our business.  They made us feel So welcomed. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EVERYTHING! Will not be returning.< /Review>

My family went in to purchase a vehicle for my daughter. We were pre-approved through Bank of America and they're the only Bank of America approved dealer near us. We found a vehicle, I gave them my pre approval number, purchased the vehicle, reiterated 2 more times I wanted my financing through B of A, and 3 weeks later I find out that we were financed through a different bank (small print). I went in to have the contract revised and I was refused and told to refinance through B of A. The finance person texted the B of A rep for the dealer and when she called back he silenced his phone. I filed a complaint with the Bank of America Escalation supervisor last week. This week I am buying my wife a car and you can guess where Im not going.< /text>

Best experience I've ever had at a dealership, got the car I wanted at a very reasonable price. I told them what I wanted and how much I could spend and they made it happen. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone! I drove all the way from Twentynine Palms and when the staff heard I am a Marine everyone went out of there way to ensure my family and I were getting taken care of, even bringing toys for my 2 year old daughter to play with. If you are military this is the place for you, well worth the drive and you know your getting a great car at a great price.< /review>

It is always a pleasure to work with this dealership. I have owned other new vehicles and experienced other dealers. However, Chevrolet Cadillac of La Quinta is by far the best. I can make an appointment easily and get my 2010 Traverse LTZ into the shop where I feel that my car is getting the best care available. My car is always returned to me clean and in good working order. The staff at the dealership is very professional, friendly and pleasant.<//Text>

My experience with La Quinta Chevrolet is exceptional. Cindy and I met Joshua Bott when out looking for a quality used car. We stopped by after visiting other dealers. Upon the first interaction with Josh we knew we were in the right place. His customer service is beyond amazing. He was friendly, honest and made our experience very pleasant. I've worked in customer service over 20 years and know extremely, exceptional, customer service, and Joshua Bott is providing that type of customer service. His approach to selling and making the experience easy is tremendous. Everyone we met at La Quinta Chevrolet provided excellent customer service. I highly recommend them. We'd also like to mention Erik Gonzalez. Outstanding customer service. Erik is always available and provided us with first class service. We felt very comfortable with everyone on the staff. The entire experience was very well received, we are appreciative of the remarkable service this dealership provides. Thank you for your dedication to us and again for the quality customer service.< /Review>

Was up for diagnostics the forth of July week.  They found a so called oil leak that the guy acted like I should know about, doesn't exist and when they sent me the service card, it became plural oil leaks.  Checked the engine, where I park my car in the garage and work and oddly enough there was no oil  from this leak.  It also has a recall for the ignition switch, which as long as I  own the car will not be fixed.  My Husband doesn't want it done, yet it was supposidly discussed, but not one word was said about it when I dropped the car off.  Was on the service form.  So, in other words, make sure you read that before you sign it, they'll slip extra services in on you.  In closing, I have owned a Chevy for the last 33 years and this place and company has turned me off so badly that my next new car won't be one of theirs, nor of the chevolet  brand</Text>

Chevy La Quinta is the only place you should shop for your next vehicle, friendly and very considerate of what you bring to the table! Honest and very big hearted people who aren't there for the paycheck, consumer minded and personable. Thanks Chevy for the latest addition, now I can cruise around in style.< /text>

<review>Have had multiple problems since taking my vehicle in. Vehicle is worse then first going in.  Back pillars are still wrong and now scratches on bumper and doors caused by the dealership.  AC still doesn't feel right.  Straight edge razor blade was left in the vehicle, which I have 3 kids, one being two years old and loves to play in the vehicle.  The first time screws were left in the back and now that?  Ugly oil marks on inside of car.  Car has been to a dealership three times within 4 weeks of ownership.  Needs to go back the fourth time to fix the things this specific dealership did.  On top of that my 2017 Tahoe still isn't right. Make sure you inspect your vehicle before going home.  Good times...

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Went in for an oil change and was told it would take 1 to 1 1/2 hours with the car washed. I do believe the oil change was done quite quickly, however it took an extremely long time for the car wash. I've seen 8 year olds do a better job at washing cars. The truck doesn't even look like it was washed, there is mud on the tail gate and bumper, dirt still visible on the sides, tires still dirty, and the hood has streaks of dirt across the center. Perhaps they just sprayed it with water for looks. I had to go find the service manager to get my truck back due to the length of time it was taking.</Text>< pics>

Always there is an issue with this dealer. They never done there job correctly!
I came to fixed my vehicle and they told me it is going to take six days but it took 8 because they order the wrong part🤭.
They give an appropriate to do the oil change and they told me it’s going to take from one hour to two hours but it took over three hours😤  guys seriously it’s only oil change 😡. Never recommend this place to anyone.</Text>

<Text>Very difficult to reach a service advisor by going through the automated phone system. Once I had spoken with someone and got my request rolling, the communication was good. The estimated price for the repair needed was very high. I ended up having the work done at a local mechanic for approx $1000 less than was quoted by your dealership. That is the reason I would hesitate to recommend the dealership for service. My situation was unique in that I was traveling and had to work with the dealership by phone from approx 80 miles away. I do appreciate that I was allowed to leave my vehicle on the lot for a few days until I could return and pick it up.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80daf8fe8e6e54d3:0xca3d2b3cf1cb1515<//Gmap_id>< userid>

Service department was horrible. Never called me back to keep me informed, car was there all weekend and no one knew what was wrong with it or if it was completed . I had to wait till monday. Then it was there for over a week and i had to call to find out progress and track down rental car. They kept saying they would call me to let me know whats going on with certain aspects of the service and never did. Worst experience.</Text>

<text>I get to the dealership. I go to Justin's office. He was not there. The young lady that seats by his side. Said Justin will be right back. I waited for almost 10 minutes. Why didn't she page him and tell him that i was waiting in there? When he walked in after 10 minutes smelling like a ashtray. He walks right by me no good morning, no how are you today, sorry for the wait, nothing. I have been in customer service for many years this is not how treat a customer. So anyways he ignores me completely. He gets on the phone and calls another customer skips me. He can just check me in real fast i have appointment after all. Then he his on the call for another 5 minutes. Still not even acknowledge me. He is acting like my money doesn't even count. I have bought 3 cars thru you guys. Then he gets off the phone and starts to help me. Then my dash board cluster is very dim. The car only has 58k miles on it. 2017 Chevrolet traverse. He wants to charge 140 dollars to look at it. Then he wants to charge me nearly $600 dollars to change 2 tire sensor's. Somebody slashed my tires, So spent 800 bucks on 4 brand new tires, 80 bucks to change a cabin air filter. filter is just 5 bucks. Then car took almost 2 hrs to complete, he knew i was waiting in the dealership for the car.. I asked Justin what was taking so long. He said there just behind. It was waiting for 10 to 15 minutes for a wash. I have it on camera.  I just bought 2019 Chevrolet traverse. I don't think i will own another Chevrolet again. You guys have terrible customer service. I fill like a just a number. I know how i should be treated. I fill like not even going back ever again.<//text>< pictures>

This happened a while ago. I drove my truck out here to get it checked out before having to make a drive all the way to the east coast. I'd had no previous trouble with the truck. The service guy -JOE GUTIERREZ- tells me that my transmission is ruined and won't even get me back to base (29 palms) an hour away. Insists that I replace the whole thing for almost 4k. This was not an option as I was leaving town less than a week later. So I drove it back to base (successfully), then across the country (successfully), then I used it every day for about 3 months. Finally I took it in somewhere else to get it looked at, and the guy tells me I can EASILY get another 10,000 miles out of my transmission. So take my advice and get a 2nd opinion, then maybe a 3rd cause La Quinta is shady. Oh, and JOE GUTIERREZ is a turd. 0/10 would not recommend.<//text>

Went on a Monday my day off. When I arrived after driving an hour and a half. Supposedly the car was sold the night before. Wasted my time from 1230-6:00pm. To find out all the promises and assurances over the phone before I went and he didn't even let me know about the car being sold before I left that morning after he called me saying everything was fine. Horrible service. They don't know half of whats going on in their own dealership. Promises galore. Nobody wants your friendship just a vehicle.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We Met Josh Isbell, the owner's son and he told us that he would help us out and take care of us we went on a test ride of the vehicle and he was very egotistical. Since he was young we Looked over that trait. We went back today to finish up the deal,  he was working at the dealership, we were there for over three hours, and he never came over once  to help. The service we received was awful. This would've been the second time I purchased a vehicle from the dealership. Sad to say I will never go back there. They should've stayed in Simi Valley.  There is no place in the desert for service such as this.</review><user>102068865695336258580<//user><GmapID>0x80daf8fe8e6e54d3:0xca3d2b3cf1cb1515<//GmapID><resp>{'time': 1547171945893, 'text': 'Marcella,\nWe are disappointed by your feedback as well as respect for our ownership.

Great cars, friendly salesmen but when I totaled my car and went to ask for a refund on extended warranty and gap insurance I had to keep bugging and it took them 4 months to give me the check even though the check was dated 2 months earlier. But I did love the car I purchased there.<//review>

I came in on a scheduled appointment at 0830 didn't leave until after 1300!!! For an oil change and to replace a serpentine belt; which the old one was never found and given to me!! Jose Herrera was more concerned with the fact that the pizza they ordered had arrived and everyone was "busy" that's why no one was able to locate the old serpentine belt!! I will never go back!! It's a shame because I had taken this same vehicle to MyChevrolet of Salinas, California and had never had a problem!! As far as I'm concerned this place doesn't even deserve one star!!< /Review>

Terrible customer service, wouldn't return my calls while they had my car. Did repairs I was not told about. Couldn't get a hold of anyone all day in the service dept even after leaving several messages until the receptionist picked up due to no one answering in service dept. Was told the driver was on the way back to dealership and would be right over to pick me up. 45 mins l later I had to again call the dealership as driver never showed up and I was told oh there was a problem and they would now send driver to pick me up. Worst experience at this dealership!< /text>

<review>Update: I would like to change my rating after the new owners made the situation right. I spoke with the new owner which he was onsite when I was dealing with this issue. He reassured me that he would take care of it and did. My truck was damaged when the previous owners were in charge and they wanted to fix it their way but after the first attempt looked horrible, I wanted to choose my own body shop. This business is now family owned and operated and they service my personal and fleet vehicles. They do an amazing service job and Henry is the best! I referred my father to them and he purchased a new 2500 diesel LTZ from them.

Stay away!! I brought my 2017 Chevrolet 2500 Silverado for a simple oil change and they damaged my fender! They tried having it fixed but it looks like a 6 year old tried fixing it. I have spent 2 weeks calling Dan their service manager and he finally called me back after 2 weeks and calling corporate and he wants me to take it to their repair facility. He said the dealer wanted to keep it off insurance and they would pay cash for it. After the body work their guy did I don’t want anyone they have touching my 60k truck, I will take it to the repair facility of my choice now. The service advisors at this location are great but the management here is complete garbage! I would expect this type of service from jiffy lube, not a reputable Chevrolet dealer. I cannot believe they would risk losing a customer over a couple hundred dollars. Please, if you’re considering a dealership or a repair facility, I recommend you save yourself some headache and use another one.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We were about to get service for a lost key and keyfob while we were traveling they made room for us and assured us everything would be ok, they were even going to give us a discount, right before they were to start working on our issue, the hotel called us and stayed they had found the key the night prior. So we canceled just in time the staff there were very professional and understanding, after talking with one of the members and asking how could I clean a huge greas mark let by another Chevrolet dealer in Tucson (Watson) he had one of his detailed look at it and the cleaned up 90% of the stain the other 10% was too far embedded bu Watson Chevrolet, yet it looks very clean compared to before. Next time I stop in Palm Springs I will visit just to say hello, over buy my next vehicle from when I'm ready.<//text>

I gotta say I usually don't leave a review for a car dealership, but I'm pretty darn happy with our company's truck purchase and with La Quinta Chevrolet. Our real estate company bought a Silverado and drove it off the lot with equity in it, according to Kelley Blue Book. Our sales rep was Ilene and her manager Eddie did what they could to fimd the right truck. 5 stars as far as we are concerned!</text>

Picked it up Dec 8 now clunk on passenger  side. Took it right back over. You kept it for almost a week and were unable to offer us a loaner. We had to wait longer for warrantee insurance inspection. CAR WAS supposedly repaired ,took it back next morning Saturday.  Joe said no loaner so take it home for weekend . On Monday took Cadillac in and got loaner. Picked up car on Wed and problem still not corrected. Being that I took it in 3 times and they worked on I don't feel your techs are qualified. Called 6hours ago to Joe and manager Dan today and no return call.< /Review>< Time>

<text>Towed in my Chevy Malibu 2015, due to my battery completely dying at the lights on my way from work.The cust serv rep wasn't aware my car needed a "special kind of battery" which cost me almost $400 to replace, misquoted at a difference of $90 plus $100 extra for the technician since it was a "complicated battery". Prices outrageous for a simple replacement. Don't even want to imagine how expensive other parts might cost....wouldn't have purchased this vehicle if I had known this.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Service writer Val was prompt about letting me know cost to my repairs, but when I called 6 times to leave messages that I need to be picked up and is my car ready no one will answer and transfer me to a generic voice mail, spoke to Anthony GM very helpful to explain it Hqrts has a new phone service implemented so for some don't expect a call back if you get that generic voice mail. :/<//review>< response>

<Review>Called Cadillac of La Quinta and scheduled an oil change for 11 a.m. this morning. Arrived at the dealership at 10:53 a.m. The service adviser wrote up my car and after signing the paperwork, he let me know that it will be a couple of hours. Sounds odd for just an oil change... Looked at the paperwork, and to my surprise, the date promised said 12/22/2017 - 6:00 p.m.

In whose right mind is an oil change supposed to take 7 hours to complete??? I've worked in service before and can tell you that it shouldn't even take an hour. And what do you expect me to do in these 7 hours? Sit in your crammed waiting room that barely had enough seats for all of your WAITING customers? I had an APPOINTMENT! I mean, it's not like you are going to give me a loaner for an oil change, so why make customers wait 7 hours on their car after a scheduled appointment? This place makes no sense.

And don't get me started on the price, $54.00 for a NON-SYNTHETIC swap, as per RO. The owner's manual for the 6.2L recommends a BLEND; but just FYI, you can get Mobile 1 FULL-Synthetic Dexos Certified and a premium filter for less than their price at your local auto parts stores. I don't mind paying, but at least be reasonable and offer a positive experience.

When you buy and expensive Cadillac, you would expect a certain standard beyond the showroom and the warranty life of your car. Just because I didn't buy my car here, doesn't mean that I'm worth less than the customers who did. If the service is on par with my expectations, I would definitively drop my money here and have work done. Sadly, that isn't the experience I had today. I ended up leaving before my car even left your service drive.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I went today to get a new key ordered it through the phone about two days ago sent in got it but to my surprise the key wasn't cut and when I asked they said yes walked to the back came back 2 minutes later told me they couldn't cut it so now I'm stuck with a worthless key. Told me to go try a locksmith the key itself was $4 and $22 for cutting which never happened so I paid for nothing.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I came into the dealership and was looking to possibly trade in my Tahoe.  After working with the internet manager as well as Manny, both employees were the most honest car salesmen I have worked with here in the desert.  They gave me advice on what to look for when purchasing a car as well as suggestions on what to do.  In the end, I kept my Tahoe and they still treated me with respect even thou I didnt purchase a vehicle with them. Very impressive! If you are looking to purchase a Chevy, definitely give them a try :)< /Review>< Pics>

Reps do not respect your valuable time. The entire so called team is pretty terrible. How can one drive off with a car after negotiating for 5 hours of my time and 3 weeks later be told. " The deal cannot be done, need to give the car back" Told them from the very beginning not to waste my time. Would not recommend at all... similar experience also happened 2 years ago at the same place as well.</text>

Tried buying a new Colorado thru Costco but was told that it didn't qualify for the special discount.  Called Costco and they assured me that it does, but once again, the dealer said no.  Went down the street and bought a NIssan instead and I was a LONG time Chevy guy.</Review>

Joseph flowers was fantastic. I gave him a strict budget of what I can do and it was hard considering I was upside down on my previous car. But after a few hours, not only did he deliver on his word to get me exactly what I asked for, he also provided me with even more gifts with it than I even imagined. The whole chevy team was friendly and patient and gave me the time to sort what I wanted. I promised that if he got me a good deal I'd recommend. So everyone please if you're looking for a good car at a damn good price, go down to chevy of Laquita and ask for Jospeh. He will take care of you</text>

To say that I'm impressed with their customer service would be an understatement. Their professionalism is outstanding, and their curtesy to customers is unparalleled. My salesman, Joshua Bott, was kind and knowledgeable, patient, and most importantly he was not pushy or overbearing. I felt I made an informed decision when I purchased my 2017 Cruze from him just this past weekend. I'm loving my new car and I am a new fan of La Quinta Chevrolet. I will be recommending them indefinitely. Thank you, Josh and LQ Chevrolet team! I'm one happy gal.

<Time>1478529926415<//Time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Took in my 2012 Sonic for  full diagnostic. Thought there were boost leaks. They tell me my turbo is cracked intetnally, which made sense, these cars have turbo issues. So for close to $2k. They replace that, both cam acuators (even though only one was bad; he didn't tell me he was doing both either) and a water outlet. Car was driven well over 100 miles because 1/4 tank of gas was gone. Not to mention it was reading 33mpg which is only possible if you drive the piss out of it. So I drive to Riverside and on the way back my CEL returns with the same code and my turbo isn't spooling. Get home pop the hood for the first time, yes they installed the new parts, but I notice lots of dangling line that weren't routed correctly. I am fuming!!! I don't spend the money to take my car to the dealer to get ripped off. I have never had a problem in IL, so come on get it together. The only reason you guys get 1 star is because Henry the service writer is a nice guy and helped how he could. I'll be in there today to get this taken care of, because now I'm losing more money becauwe I'm forced to miss work. The techs clearly don't know what they are doing. Once this problem is fixed I will never go to this location for service and probably will never buy another Chevy.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1478637217227, 'text': 'Jagger, I am very sorry to hear of your recent experience with our service department.

Picked up truck the next day after receiving a excellent report on truck. Parked in my driveway and noticed oil dripping from oil filter. Then crawled under truck to see what was leaking and discoved that truck was never lubed. Took pictures and called dealship to talk to service manager. Service manager was on another call so I spoke with a lady concerning my problem with services not done, but paid to be done! Took truck to different lube shop to have it inspected and lubed. I have pictures after the service from different lube shop. Very dissatified with this dealership.

<Text>We turned in our 2011 Black SRX in June 2014 and leased a new 2014 Black SRX.  We are not from the Desert, but were pleased with the price and experience.  However, at the time of the sale we were told that the dealership would "take care of everything" and turn in the Release of Liability form immediately.  Within  a few weeks we started getting notices from "Fastrak" that are old car was running through without paying the proper fees.  We attached the appropriate forms that showed we no longer owned the car and sent it into the proper authorities.  WE HAVE TRIED CALLING SO MANY TIMES TO LA QUINTA CADILLAC AND IT HAS TO BE THE WORST PHONE SERVICE AND SERVICE IN GENERAL.  I am on the phone once again to them and have been transferred five times so far.  We have left messages for the General Manager and he never calls back.  This dealership is horrible.  After receiving 4 more notices of FasTrak violations we went to DMV and refiled the Release of Liability which we would have done ourselves originally.  We think someone there is driving our old car and just wanted to get to the bottom of this problem.  Now the dealership has me on hold again...let's see so far it has been 7 minutes!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1420750185194, 'text': 'Richard, we are so sorry to hear that you’ve been experiencing so much trouble with your old car. We apologize that we have been difficult to get a hold of. We want to get to the bottom of this and will do so ASAP. We are glad we were able to connect this week and work through some things. We will stay in touch through the process. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.'}</response>< Gmap_id>
