I come here hope to see hot women. I hear people can drink things other than soda and water. I was happy.

I go in and see attractive women but women only show breast. I want to see no clothes. If I want to see this I go to beach.<//Text>

Great place, we had a great time, the DJ is so good, not very big but the atmosphere is soo cool the only thing is there is only one bathroom, but this doesn't matter at all because every thing else is perfect, i will definitely be back again.</text>

The two girls from Kansas were great. Amazing dancers on the stage. I’m really hoping The Body Shop holds onto them. Their performances on the pole was one of the best I’ve seen.

Had a really good time. It did feel a little hot in there. Wish it was cooler. I also thought it was on the dimmer side in terms of lighting, but overall, it was still a great time. There was a bathroom attendant who was really nice. I forgot his name... I think it was Jorge. He was really personable. Good guy!</Review>

I haven't been here since last September, but I need to start going again. I'm not understanding some of the bad reviews. It almost feels like some people are not telling the truth. Unless something has changed... but I doubt it. I think it's still the same owner, right?

The girls actually dance nude here. You can't say that about the others, where they're all about getting their private dances. And won't show anything on the stage.

Yes, there's a cover, and they want you to buy a drink or two. But overall, it's like 20 dollars total to get in. That's not bad.

The girls at this location are really attractive, too. Not sure if they still work there, but Candy, Maylani, and Sunshine were great!

There was a different girl that smelled bad towards the end of the night, but maybe she was just sweaty. That was probably a fluke.

Hopefully, everything is still the same since September, I'll be going back here more in the future.

I wish the girls would get there closer to 11. Some nights it feels like the girls don't come out until 1 in the morning.

I also wish they’d lower the VIP price from 200 to 150.</Text>

They are horrible service like the guy at the front just wants to take your money even if to lie to you. The club is so dry and they try to charge you and take your things so be careful . Horrible experience<//text>

For dancers who might want to dance here definitely look else where first. They are very unprofessional and there is definitely favoritism. My friend and I are new here and when a regular that spends money came in only the girls that him and his friends liked went on stage. There was no rotation at all. When we both asked the dj at separate times when we were going to be up next he shrugged us off. All they care about is if customers are literally throwing money and making a scene. Definitely a last resort club for us. The worst part if you're a customer planning on going is that the girls you get to see are limited to who Mr. or Mrs. Moneybags want to see.<//Text>

< Review>
Kinda missed the old body shop pre fire. So so on a slow night. Midday was interesting. Girl was okay. Going too try another day on a night.
20.00 door with 2 drink min.
Pricey if its dead inside. Kinda stupid.
But if it was a live night and more going on. Then i see a 20.00 cover. Midday or early birds should be cheaper or free and just have 10.00 drink min for 2 drinks. Maybe a brunch special would draw in customers. But what do I know it's not like im running a better club myself.</Review>

< review>
had a great time at the body shop, lots of good looking girls and lots of variety both in terms of looks and aggressiveness of them trying to sell you.  entered the club, sat at the stage immediately me and me m8s were approached by a few girls. my girl immediately saddled up to me, introduced herself, and started to massage my cock. she suggested we take a trip to the back room for a dance, so sure why not.

there are all sorts of dances, I had a few they varied from girl to girl - the above mentioned was a great dance but she was trying to get me into the VIP room at $200 for 15 mins but I just got there so I was told her to relax. another girl was very pretty eastern bloc type but the dance was mediocre and she was just hustling.

some good dancers on the stage too. had the front row seat, good view. finally they had two girls on then two stages. was about ready to leave but was approached by a goddess asking if I wanted to have some fun in the back. i couldn't resist so I went. best dance of the night, amazing girl she must have been on the Molly because it was fantastic. anyways it made my night and I recommend the body shop!

also random extra info - this was on a Friday we got there around 11pm and it wasn't too crowded. started to fill up around 130/2 when the bars close. got in for "free" with a VIP pass on the website but in reality it was $10 and they waived the "2 drink minimum". not a bad deal it's full nude no alcohol though.  $25 for topless lap dance, $40 for fully nude, $200 for 15 min "VIP room". bring some money and have a good time<//review>

Victra/Verizon- Making the best of a weird year of physical distancing and mask-wearing. Online check-in process upon arrival, easily explained. I wish there was a sign showing where you were on the list though, with a time estimate once you're logged in. Employee welcomed me when it was my turn, had to wait about 15-20 outside. Helpful employee made the process painless to upgrade to my new phone.</Text>

I called the store 12/26 and was told to "come in tomorrow at 10 am. I won't be there but my boss will be here and he will take care of you."
I arrived at 9:45 with my girlfriend and son. No one arrived until 10:30 and then they had to "setup the store". My son was in a hurry because he was leaving town. He was SO patient with them as they slowly moved forward.
I chose BOGO IPhone deal and was told one phone would be ordered today and available "before New Years but that second phone would be available about 1/7". I asked if I could pick up first phone have it set up and wait for second phone. Fabian stated "Yes I will set it up for you with SIM and your trade in, then complete the deal when 2nd one comes in". Sounded Good to me.
I called today and was told VERY RUDELY by other employee AND Fabian that I could NOT get first phone but had to wait until BOTH phones came in or I would "lose BOGO and all PROMO's." I was told "you should know this", however this is my first time with Verizon AND I was told different! I confirmed what I was told with girlfriend. She recalls what I noted
No Manager available and they would not tell me when he was going to be in so I could speak with him. Very RUDE!
AVOID this place!!!!!< /review>

I don't think I could say enough good things about Jake, who is the manager at the Clovis store. He went above and beyond to make sure my issues were addressed and taken care of which is what customer service is supposed to be about and it's very rare these days. I have been with Verizon for over 10 years and although they have always been really good to me over the years his attention to my problems were the best I've ever seen< /Text>

Friendly, and quick service. I appreciate the representative giving me all the options and not just shoving one at me. I felt like I had the last say in what I wanted. Also, being able to choose what I wanted didn't seem to offend his sales ego, which was nice. Thank you for your time! I'll definitely come in if I have any other issues.< /Review>

I worked with a rep named Ivan he gave a really good deal on accessories with my new iPhone 11 that I purchased from that store. He helped me port my line over from T-Mobile very quickly. Also there was a little issue with the system accepting my promotion and he kept me involved until he got it added on. He did a great job!<//Text>

I went in to get my girlfriend a phone for Christmas and Fabian was extremely helpful and even helped me with a box for the gift. I’ve been with Verizon for a while and I’ve never had a experience at a store that has stuck out definitely making this my main location. Great customer service. ❤️</review>

This has been hands down one of the best Verizon stores I have gone to in the Fresno area! I had came in with a new iphone 11 and needed to restore my data. Anayda was extremely helpful!! Not only did she restore my data, but she went above and beyond to explain the different capabilities of the new iphone 11 vs samsung. I definitely wish I had spoken to her before making my initial purchase.... thank you so much Anayda! I'll definitely come back to purchase my next phone from here,  your enthusiasm and kindness was appreciated!!<//review>

Ivan was very honest and nice he helped me with everything that I needed and he was very patient and kind of the entire time I will definitely be returning to this store whenever I need any help with my account I'm very pleased with the service that I received in this store I would give them a 100 stars but my option is up to 5.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

We all say don't trust lawyers or used car sales men...but these sales workers at telecommunication companies are the real snakes. Their job is to convince you to give them money for something you don't need. There is a very special place in the after life for the people who prey on the entire population the way that they do. They lied about the BOGO offer and didn't tell me I had to pay the entire tax. Then there was an additional $20 fee, $30 fee, another $20, and another $30 fee. Then after all was said and done there was another 2 $110 fee ($220 total) that I didn't know about until the next bill. They also promised 2 sets of free headphones and said I didn't need to make a 3rd party account to do it but I did..twice. then the offer got denied for the headphones because I was 1 day out if the technical pre-order period. They also said screen protectors don't exist for this model phone in order to try and up sale me on 2 other $50 products. After searching the web, I determined  that was also a lie.</text>

<review>Ivan quoted wrong price for family plan, added an $10 WARANTEE charge for home phone connector without asking us. I had to spend 4 hours on phone with Verizon getting our plan reduced and was still more than his quote. He needs to learn pricing of their plans!  Won't be going back to That Store!< /review>< Pictures>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>If I could give "0" stars I would . So I walked into the store looking to upgrade my phone and was looking at the Bogo deal for the iPhones . I was helped by someone named Ivan . He said they didn't have the color of phones I wanted in the store but was going to place an order and they would be in on Tuesday. I was going to go look at a different store to see if they had the colors I wanted in stock.I asked him if I was obligated to get the phones and he assured me I was not obligated.  So I went to a different Verizon that was NOT retail and they had them in stock
I tried to place the order and then found out Ivan ordered the phones onto my account without my authorization! So I was unable to purchase the phones I wanted . Trying to get the order off the account was hell ! I still don't have the phones I want because my account is locked and the Manager's at the retail store by the name of Alex and Daniel were no help. If I am not crazy it sounds like that was pretty obligated to me if you ordered it on my account without authorization! PLEASE DONT SHOP AT RETAIL  PHONE STORES!</text><date>1550128903820<//date>< user_id>

<user_name>Amir Ardekani</user_name><Review>Not a real Verizon store. They are a reseller that will double charge you on fees. They double charged me for a phone activation fees and the manager refuses to contact me back. They added the fees after doing the work but never of had my approval for it. Since they ported my phone number over I was forced to accept. If I went to a real Verizon store they will not charge me a $30 set up fee for each phone on top of the $30 activation fee on each line.

Sold me a case for the wrong model of phone, when the sales associate couldn't make it fit on my phone in store, they said unfortunately they don't offer refunds on accessories and they would have to order a case since they were all out in store of any that would have actually fit my phone... Ridiculous... I hadn't even left the store and only got the case because they said it was the only one they had for my model. Their mistake not mine. If I wanted to order a case I've actually used a computer before believe it or not and could have done so on my own. Do not use these guys. They're scam artists. If you are a Verizon customer you should go to the actual Verizon stores, not the authorized resellers.<//Review>

Dishonest sales tactics from Iris, the assistant manager.  Went in on june 2 to upgrade my device, got told that there was a $120 charge due for upgrading that could be offset  y purchasing three accessories.   A few days later i went in to question it and the story changed to the purchase of the accessories would enable them to remove my $20 a month line access fee, which was a lie (according to verizon corporate,  i get the $20 line access fee removed because I'm financing the phone out of contract).  Went in today (6/16/16) to inquire and they attempted to give me back less than $90 as a refund for the three items. They also tried to charge me $40 for "setup and go" when all Iris did was insert a sim card and hand me the phone to enter my gmail account.  They reluctantly refunded that charge also after an hour of going back and forth with Mario (the manager).  When i asked to speak to the owner i was told "there isnt one".  Once i convinced Mario to call his boss, he had a short conversation with him about my refund, neglecting to give any details of my issues and refused to allow me to talk to his boss (wonder why...).  Once they decided to refund the charges and items i was told it had to be a corperate check.  I paid in cash.  So they basically lied to me to gain an upsale on the upgrade, then charged me for a service they did not provide, and when called out on it, they tried to back pedal and give me other excuses (that were shot down because of info i had from Verizon corperate), then flat refused to refund me in cash. They expected me to hand over products and wait for my money to come back in the form of a check.  I finally convinced him to just credit one of my bank cards, which he did with a response of "its still going to take 3 or 4 days for you to get the credit".  Bottom line, save yourself the  trouble and headaches, if you need to upgrade, go to a corperate store or just call corperate, you'll  have a far better experience.</text>

<review>Me and my sister went to this Verizon thinking we could pay for our bill because we were closer to this one at the time and usually pay for the bill inside at another Verizon.. Me and my sister was behind a worker when he was entering in and he didn't bother to open the door and acknowledge us (its like when someone opens the door and your right behind them and they just let the door swig and you have to catch the door....) and he glared at us when we walked in.. We thought there was a machine to pay for the bill so we asked the worker and he said that he can do it.. so I pulled out my check and he told me that they don't accept checks... Note I would used my card, but it has a limit and obviously the bill was pass the limit i can spend with my card... So me and my sister walked out annoyed because he was rude and looked like he didn't want to be there.. This was about a year ago, but when you have a bad experience it sticks onto you...< /review>< name>

<Text>Got some great juice from here definitely try no hype butter pecan and ice cream if you like dessert flavors chill layed back vine price was not the best I’ve seen but ehh not too bad I payed 25 for 120 mils if you need juice and in Downey hit this spot up if the juice was 20 for 100 mil 22 for 120 and 13 for 60 this spot would be 5 star but it’s business I get it<//Text>< user>

< review>
This place has a variety of juices, mods, tanks and great prices. The staff there is very helpful and kind. They answered all my questions. I highly recommend this vape shop. I have gone to a variety of different shops within the Los Angeles area but Downey Vapes have provided the best customer service.< /review>

When I told them I wouldn’t buy there because of that the associate asked me if I give discounts to every local business?
I don’t generally work with other small businesses usually individuals, but yes I would always honor a deal to help us both and strengthen local community. To that he answered sarcastically “sounds like a great business model”.<//text>< username>

<Review>I was disappointed to see that the only women's work attire was nursing scrubs. As my work contracts with this store and allows us to charge our work clothes and boots, I had no choice but to purchase there. I was forced to purchase men's work attire, for working maintenance, which doesn't fit correctly or feel comfortable. In addition, they had only 2 options for women's steel toe boots. Maintenance is no longer a male only trade and clothing options for women should be available. All in all, I was left frustrated with the lack of selection for women and everything was really expensive. It is high quality clothing and shoes and for sure priced accordingly. I wouldn't have been able to buy my clothes there if I was the one having to pay.< /Review>< pics>

<Response>{'time': 1581089119254, 'text': "Hi Amanda - thanks for your review & our apologies about your experience.  We want to solve this, too.\n\nThat said, We are aware of the lack of women's options in our store and are working feverishly to add more options as they become available from our vendors & the industry in general.  Sadly, there are not many options out there that have consistent stock, good value and great fit.\n\nIn the event a team member wasn't available to show you, we also carry Women's 5.11 Work Pants and Women's Dickies Work Pants at our Oakley Location.  We also have more additional Timberland Pro Women's Steel Toe boots arriving this week.  The team is more than happy to transfer or source/special order whatever you'd like - so long as we confirm stock from our vendors.\n\nOur hope is to better assist you in the future.  We appreciate your business and are excited about enhancing our women's selection as the need is definitely there.\n\nIf possible, please reach out to me directly so I can attempt to provide a solution for you in the meantime.  Kris @ 209.609.2394.  We appreciate the opportunity to serve you."}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808566d9f5439241:0x58cc2349f95f2f85</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I agree with most posts. Staff was very helpful and I got the feeling they wanted to be there (you can’t say that about all retail stores). Ron helped me find a pair of boots that made the most sense for what I’m doing every day. I tried on more boots today than I ever have. Ron was patient and informative and I appreciate his respect, his knowledge, and his concerns for customer satisfaction. Great job today, Ron.<//review>

<review>A quick lesson in retail for your employees.
If you have a customer that comes in every few months for boots and/or pants and spends anywhere from 150 to 300 each time , i would suggest not giving said customer a hard time when trying to return a shirt. Especially when the reason is because it was washed one time before trying it on. It was never worn to work.
Consider maybe taking the $70 hit instead of losing a customer forever....and no I'm not digging through the trash for the labels....but thanks.</review>< Name>

I went in here to buy some black jeans for my new job, the ladies that were working here are the friendliest, and most helpful people. I would highly recommend this store!<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1576077872548, 'text': 'Hi Tim-\n\nSorry about your experience with long johns. We hope your overall store experience was better.\n\nWe only carry Carhartt base layers and our prices are governed by Carhartt’s policies. Please note, we offer a price match guarantee and new customer discounts. Also - the base layers we offer from Carhartt are the best on the market & include technology to keep you warm and dry.\n\nIf you are looking for cheaper options, JC Penny has great options without technology for considerably less.\n\nAppreciate the opportunity to serve you! Thanks for giving us a try.'}</Response>< pictures>

Brain-dead inventory babysitter guy... his favorite word is "uuhhhmmm"  followed by, we don't carry that.  Me, "can you order it?"  Him, "uuhhhmmm, I don't know if they have any in stock..."  waist of my time... went there willing to drop over $200. I'll take my chances with amazon.</review>

<review>This easily accessed turn out is a fabulous spot for gorgeous vistas. On a clear day you can even see the Pacific Ocean and possibly Catalina Island. Best viewing is in late fall and early spring around 2 to 4pm when the sun reflects off of the water surface for a dazzling display. The picture above is equally dramatic with clouds that gave the highway its name, Rim of the World<//review>< pictures>

On a clear day, or night, you can see from San Gorgonio to the east all the way around to Catalina to the west. Awesome!< /Text>

I love to get coffee at Peet's whenever I can. Great coffee and lattes. Had a really delicious blueberry crumble bar too. Love the shop and the atmosphere.  Really helpful and friendly service. Wish I lived closer, I'd be here all the time. Guess I'll have to settle for buying bags of it to make at home.<//review>

12 minutes and an obnoxious attitude by out of order big girl. Pete's doesn't have the same caliber of service as the bay area. If you support equality DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE!<//Text>

<text>Overall an amazing coffee place. Most of the employees are great, but.... recently Visiting your studio city branch a couple hours ago (around 2pm pst), one of your employees insulted me and my boyfriend because  "we asked too many questions about the menu" she stubbornly insisted/ expressed. When we asked for employees name, she got very defensive & questioned why? We answered that we're curious. The employee persisted to avoid sharing their name and ignored our additional  questionss related to the menu too. she seemed/had a voice of a woman, but it was difficult to confirm because she was wearing a hat/cap (only Peet's employee in the front at the time wearing a cap).... anyways, this has never occurred before and we will think twice before if/when we'll revisiting to make sure to avoid the presence of this employee's vibe. She also hit on me , and I don't think it's right an employee hits on another person (in this case me: a female) especially in the presence of her partner (ie: my boyfriend).</text>< Pics>

Went to buy beans and wasn't able to find the help I needed. No one was able to answer my questions and ended giving me their Coffee A-Z book to learn more about the coffee I wanted to purchase. I still bought beans, but not because anyone there made a sale.</review>

I admit, I’m usually a Starbucks person. But I walked into Pete’s to grab a cold brew and it’s actually much better. Really fresh cold brew. And nice employees for someone who hasn’t been to Pete’s before.< /Review>

I love Peet's Coffee.  High quality and a cut above.  Staff is very knowledgeable, courteous, and professional, and certainly nice enough. They know the product line and are always forthcoming if asked a question. The store environment is alright, not bad.  A bit noisy and situated so the consumer doesn't get too comfortable for too long,.</review>

This Peet's has great service. I asked about the new cold brew Fog Latte and they highly recommended it. You can get it with or without milk, it has hints of chicory, and a bit of sweetener. It was SO good. At first glance it looks like a stout beer, which it pretty to look at, haha. I would definitely go back and get the Fog Latte. 👍< /Review>

<review>Great location. Surrounded by shops and restaurants. Parking is not terrible. Depends on the time you arrive there may not be a place to sit. Looks like some folks bring their books and laptops and camp for a while. Wifi is better than average.  Service is good. 2 bathrooms always clean.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Always good visiting here. It's definitely a Hollywood crowd. You can often see people writng their first screenplay. It's often packed but the people are fun to watch. Staff is great and always super helpful.< /Text>

The only drawback is the lack of decent parking. However, it is very hard to beat the great selection of coffee and tea, and yummy sweets you can find here. It is also easy in and out for anyone who is us ing a wheelchair, walker or motorized scooter.</text>

Sometimes there's an uncomfortable vibe from some of the people that seem to be regulars, but the cafe itself is nice. Kinda hard to find a seat sometimes.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Service and baristas are consistent pleasant and friendly. Favorite coffee for years. I like the caramel late and the cappuccino, and their chai tea. Everything that I had tried here has been tasty. I drive 15 min just to get here. Wish they had more locations and a drive thru tho. Always a pleasant experience and a great way to start your day.</Review>< Pics>

What a great place open Crazy late. The people are always pretty cool. It's all being recycled so you feel good about it. A bit expensive but it's not a dump they still have to pick through it end send it away. I think it's worth it</Text>

< Review>
No sign anywhere that said $Cash Only$ did not find out until 30 minutes of waiting in line. It's pretty stupid that this day an age even the girls scouts and boy scouts who stand outside groceries stores can take payment on a card but these third world country idiots don't take a credit card.  They don't even deserve the one one Star .you should change your name to third world country waste service so I know what to expect.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is convenient because this will be where I live but they were exaggeratedly expensive

< review>
(Translated by Google) Very bad service I went for the first time because I looked at positive comments I went to vote for 5 bags and that was pure paper and plastic they asked me for a $ 130 deposit, when I returned they weighed again, the $ 130 they charged me, I don't think if they take something heavier

(Original)
Muy mal servicio fui por primera vez por que mire comentarios positivos fui a votar 5 bolsas y eso que era puro papel y plastico me pidieron 130$ de deposito , cuando regrese volvieron a pesar , los 130$ me cobraron , nome imajino si se lleva algo mas pesado<//review>

<review>Call these guys up and ask for Ryan. Super knowledgeable and able to answer all questions. Best thing about him is that he doesn’t oversell. His tour definitely sealed the deal for me as their quality workmanship is quite obvious.

The staff even went out of their way to tell me where and how to find the best fuel in my area, when I didn't even ask for it. Quality service. Definitely made a life long fan out of me.

The team at Weistec have made it possible for me to complete my build on time. The customer service is top notch. It shows. They really do care about the customer service. Do not pay attention to any reviews that say otherwise. Alex and his team really know their stuff about the M156 motors. I am running a Stage 2 Weistec Kit 2.3 and have had no issues thus far. The car runs strong, I have no worries whatsoever. If you have any concerns Weistec will make sure to address all of them. Don't hesitate to reach out to Weistec for your next build.<//review>

To say I am amazed at the power my car has is an understatement!  1,000hp now and she has no problem keeping up with just about any super car.  I’m very pleased with Weistec!  Wish I had started with their products from the beginning.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I was searching for a local business to upgrade my Mercedes CLA 250 and found Weistec Engineering.  I spoke with Alex Ramirez who assisted me with all of the questions and concerns that I had.  It was my first call to anyone for my engineering needs and Alex and Weistec took care of everything in a professional, informing and concerned way.  As a customer, you want everything to be as easy as possible and for me it was that and more.  I appreciate them and would just like to say, "If you have any automobile engineering needs, please give Weistec Engineeering a call.  You won't be disappointed!"<//review>

< review>
I had recently purchased a tune, vta valves, air filters and down pipes for my 2019 E63S. Cory was super helpful and was very knowledgeable on the products they offer. I emailed the tune department and told them the downpipes were being built , they said under the current conditions they would give me a stage 1 tune to use until my pipes were ready to be shipped and installed. They also sent me the stage 2 tune for the downpipes. I received the tune and downloaded it into the car, after it installed the car would not start. It was about 4:30 and I emailed the tune department and was immediately contacted by Anthony. He called me and asked me a few questions to only find out my battery was low at the time of the download. He told me they closed at 5 and he would be following up to make sure everything went ok not only did he follow up but did it after he was off for the day.
Weistec has gone above and beyond since the first phone call. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to get the most out of there car. There products were easy to install and I am impressed with the HP gains.< /review>

2009 C63 AMG:

Service: They were responsive within 5 minutes of my emails. Answered all of my questions ( I had a lot). Went above and beyond helping me with service issues unrelated to my business with them. A+.

Product: (Keep in mind I've only had it tuned for 1 day:

Weistec stage 1 tune: Throttle response feels 30%-50% faster than stock.
The "Burble Exhaust Tune" adds a very fun and exciting characteristic. The power, as far as my butt-Dyno can tell is very very noticeable and is completely transformative. Install was almost dummy proof. I will use them again, THANK YOU WEISTEC, for waking up my car!<//review>

I explained to them in detail how the car was running and how I wanted them to perform and they delivered on everything. The team is very hands on and helped me every step throughout the process. They’ll def be seeing my Mclaren 720s as soon as I take delivery as well.

5 stars guys. Thanks for the ongoing support and follow up!

Ps- this is coming from someone that already paid out the nose for renntech and Eurosport automotive tuning. Weistec fixed their tuning problems and charges half the price of these shops and delivers 100x the support and performance.  Save yourself some time and money and go with weistec for any and all tuning needs that they support. You won’t be let down< /review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Response>

<text>Previous Review: In response to Sean, the rant- in which, he demonstrates in his reply in continuously denying the truth, providing misinformation of the facts, and his lack of knowledge about any of the cars they offer services and parts for. In addition, the following text messages from the technicians that were employed by Weistec at the time they originally did my transmission to evidence yet another lie that all of Yelp, Facebook, and MB World will now see. The Xentry test they provided clearly shows the drive shaft they installed was faulty and broken. They clearly and now publicly (in their response below) attempted to fraudulently take my money for all the wrong reasons. To blame me for something that is not broken- is simply unprofessional and slandering my name. Let alone, they cannot read their own Xentry report that 2 Mercedes Benz AMG Master Technicians just laughed at once they saw and read the results and Weistec's response below:
These are perfect examples of others customers at their Anaheim headquarters in Anaheim- as you can see for yourself, with undisputed doubts. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!
Updates Review:
In response to Sean's lies below- please see the text messages from the former techs at Weistec who have been with them prior to splitting off from them due to the exact concerns from all of us customers who have been cheated. Also, see images to the valve body "upgrade" work with how they did a horrible job trying to use silicon to place together. After fraudulently diagnosed the car as broke output shaft after their Xentry told them speed signal to the wheels. Sean Saleen stated the car was not put on the lift. Quick to diagnose broken output shaft and hand me an invoice for a complete transmission rebuild. Completely amateur diagnoses in attempt to hustle me for money. Poor ethics and complete shamble of a company now since the co-owner Steve left.  He has and is trying to nickel and dime even their best customers. The driveshaft they sold me failed in well under 15,000 miles and they saw how little my car is driven. REALLY STAY AWAY FROM THEM. THEY JUST LOVE BLAMING THEIR MISTAKES AND SHORTCOMINGS ON YOU!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>First of all, I would like to thank the 2 employees working there, Zach Elmished and Anthony, for being extremely helpful.  They literally take the utter most care of their customers and their needs. The faced an issue with the item I received ( which I will not mention ) and they have agreed to replace the item and resend it free of charge. They have been with me every step of the way and I have nothing but the utter most respect for them. I hope this review will give you an idea of how much Weistec is fantastic.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcd944db21c77f:0x73351e449fbf6caa< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

These guys are jokes. One day they tell you to buy the super charger and  they say we will back you up and the if something happens to your engine they say that an old motor haha. Really you guys couldn’t tell me that before the engine blown. To cover up and put there hands in the air.... you guys be care full as well, If you look at the reviews haha there own staff is writing good stuff about there own company.
What’s wrong is wrong. That why these guys don’t install or do any other work on your car any more due to multiple engines blown and they don’t want to say that’s there fault or mess up or install was wrong.
To Weistec Engineering this was a very bad experience with you guys... SMH</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1568227054529, 'text': 'Customer purchased a Supercharger system for his 2008 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG. After installation, he called us raving about how great the car performed. He even posted videos of him doing prolonged burnouts and donuts on his social media accounts. After a period of time, he contacted us about a misfire. We diagnosed the problem to be a melted spark plug tip. This is a sign of extreme temperatures. We replaced the spark plugs and showed him that the electronic diagnostic report showed the misfire happening at nearly 7000 rpm with less than 10% fuel in the tank. This corresponded to videos on his social media of him doing donuts in a parking lot the night before.  We told him to never drive hard with less with a ¼ tank or less as it could cause fuel starvation, especially doing donuts as all the gas is pushed to a corner of the fuel tank. His response was he needed to keep weight down to have a better advantage when racing someone.\n\nApproximately two weeks later, the customer had his car towed in unannounced stating that is was not running right. Upon running our electronic diagnostics report on the vehicle, the report showed that yet again the vehicle was misfiring at nearly 7000 rpm with less than 10% fuel in the tank, but this time it caused a catastrophic failure.  We called the customer and told him that these things can happen. Even a brand new car (American or European) with performance products adding hundreds of additional horsepower can have this issue when one drives their car the way he was, especially high mileage engines such as his. He then asked if we could replace it for free.\n\nWe manufacture upgraded engine internals for this very reason, although the customer didn’t have the budget for this solution. With customer service in mind, and at no cost to him, we told him we could assist him in finding an inexpensive replacement motor and a mechanic to do the work within his budget. He said he cannot take responsibility for it because he was worried about being embarrassed among his friends and fellow car club members. He then disputed the charges with his bank in an attempt to get his money back for the supercharger. After reviewing all the evidence, the bank sided with Weistec and his dispute was not granted. Ultimately, this is a case of not taking care of your vehicle and accepting responsibility your actions.\n\nWe wish this customer the best of luck in the future.'}</Response>

< review>
I first got an ECU  tune on my 2018 AMG E63    I loved it. The result was noticeably  more power and better performance overall. But, I wanted more. So, I had the W3 turbos installed. I also installed downpipes.   I have two words to describe it: Frickin Insane.   Even at 120, you push down on the accelerator and it throws you back in your seat.   The sound coming out of the downpipes from the twin turbos opening up removes any doubt that the AMG 63 is pushing out over 700 HP and will blow away an M5. Moe  and the rest of the team gave great customer service.   The shop is clean and well organized, and very professional.</review>

What a joke of an outfit.  Went to them for a tune on my SLS.  After taking the my car to the shop to take out the ECU, leave it there for 5 days, expense of shipping and labor cost, and what I received was a damaged ECU/TCU which when installed and the car Dyno before and after this tune it showed NOT ONLY a slight drop in overall power but now both my ECU and TCU are damaged and as a result now my Engine light comes on and the engine misfires while Transmission miss gears.  When I brought this up to them they got defensive and arrogant with me saying that their Tune is the BEST and this not the case all while I have sent them the Dyno results, pictures of the engine light on,  3rd party Tune shop that explained the issues now resulting from them messing with my ECU/TCU.  I have to now reflash my ECU/TCU with factory tune at cost AND on top of it they guys are not refunding my money for their mistake and screwing up my car.  I want all to know some of these reviews here are their own employees which I spoken to....so be aware of the garbage written here as 5 star.
I am now arranging to charge back my card and prepare to sue them for damages to my car.</text>
<response>{'time': 1512582009588, 'text': 'We performed a software upgrade to your ECU and TCU.  You then called stating you don’t think it added as much power as it should have. Dyno files were provided and when we reviewed them, we saw that there were gains of 15-20hp in the mid range comparing to the best stock run.  A spike in the "stock" run resulted in an artificially high peak power on the stock run. Comparing the gains to the 2nd and 3rd "stock" runs showed almost 30HP gains in the mid range.  We asked you to provide data logs so we can have a better idea of how the engine is running.  Usually in cases were there are gains in the mid range, but not as much in the top end, it is related to fuel quality and ignition timing. You never provided the data and demanded a refund.  To get a refund, the ECU and TCU would have needed to be sent back to us for the tunes to be removed. You never sent the ECU and TCU back to us, so there was no refund authorized.  Instead you wanted to keep the ECU and TCU tune while not paying for them, so you then charged your credit card back.  We explained to American Express the situation and you lost the charge back as they agreed with us in the dispute. The day you lost the dispute you came here to post this negative review. There was never any damage to any of your computers and to this day they are probably still running our software that you tried to get for free.'}<//response><name>Mason Dari< /name>< time>

<review>Very professionally ran tire store.  There were 5 or 6 employees early to work. Everyone was happy. I got my tractor tire remounted at a great price. This store does a lot of business and all the employees I had contact with were friendly and polite. Very good tire store</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I took my all wheel/4 wheel drive, with adjustable air suspension VW Touareg for a front wheel alignment after having the front lower control arms, ball joints, and bushings replaced. A & R Tire Service got the job done, without any problems.  Now my car drives like new again. Ask for Richard, the service writer/manager he will give you service above and beyond.

Thanks Team A & R!<//Review><date>1610041538591< /date><gmapID>0x80c3367f34852c69:0xc6e1182c179b7e39< /gmapID>< Response>

Super nice place to do business.  They make you feel you count.  Rich is super friendly and gets you out in good time. I
recommend A&R Tire 100%!  Good service, good prices and honest. That really counts in these times.< /Text>

Wow ! Quick honest service . Emailed them with some questions and A & R Tire Services replied super quickly, and were more than happy to help. Went in to get some tire issues fixed and was out in about an hour and a half. Everyone was nice and understood that I wanted to keep the cost low, which it was! Will be back when I need new tires.< /Text>

I went to previous employer to talk about getting new tires,example how honest Rick is. The most honest professional place ever worked and anyone getting service here receives what paid for and then some. I appreciate the few shops which are ran with care and customer service comes first.</review>

<Text>First time visit today because of a flat tire. The manager took care of us immediately and worked on the tire himself. It was a simple fix and he didn’t ask for anything in return! I appreciate his urgency and that he wanted to make things right. With such awesome customer service, I will definitely be going back!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Just came to AR tires and had to great time there. They gave me such a great deal. They took care of me and were very informative and highly respectful. I recommend that you bring all your family and friends here for any kind of vehicle needs that they can do. Love these guys< /Review>

< Review>
Visited A&R Tire to see if they could repair a slight bend in my steel rim. Jeff behind the counter took a quick look at it and said they’d be able to fix it no problem. The service was fast and price totally reasonable. Jeff and the guys seem to really know their stuff and I would gladly recommend them to anyone looking for tire related repairs.< /Review>

A&R tire might be a good place for changing your oil and getting new tires, but don't bring it here if you need your A.C. worked on. They had my van four days and never fixed the issue I brought it in for. I wanted them to change the vacuum check valve. I researched the issue online before I went down and found the following information: "Typically this occurs due to a bad vacuum check valve under the hood. During hard acceleration the AC door system loses vacuum, causing the doors to default to the windshield. This check valve keeps this from occurring. It is located under the passenger side of the hood."
I Gave Anthony the paper I printed describing the issue and $406 later I had the same issue, the A.C. stops blowing when I accelerate. Instead, they replaced all my HVAC hoses and put in freon. I immediately returned the A&R and Anthony told me to bring it back the next day and they would take care of the problem and not charge me any further labor.
I brought the van back the next day and gave them another print out describing the issue and Rick checked me in and put it on the work order. I called that afternoon and talked to Richard. Since they had to order the part it would not be there in time before closing. The next day,  I call to get a status and talk to Richard who tells me they have the part they just need to get the tech back to install it. Later I call again and Anthony tells me he had to order the part and didn't want me to have an aftermarket valve, so he ordered a Motorcraft part, but it won't be in until the end of the day. (I thought you already had the part) The next day, Anthony calls me and says the part didn't come in until that morning and he would not be able to get my van to me by 11 a.m. as I wanted. I told him to go ahead and put the part in because I canceled my appointment as I was suffering from a kidney stone.  Later in the day, I get a call from Anthony telling me they found another issue. Mind you, they have supposedly been all this work without charging additional labor. The new issue Anthony tells me about is the HVAC selector switch on the dash. That's the problem and it will cost me an additional $308 to get a new switch, but it won't get there until Monday. I told him I couldn't do that and to put the van back together and I would pick it up.
When I got back in the van (Wheelchair accessible van) believing they changed the Vacuum check valve that would have corrected the issue, I started driving up Archibald at 35 MPH, the A.C. stopped and defaulted to the defroster until I let off of the accelerator.  Four days, $400+ dollars, and the problem I took it in for was not corrected.  I won't be back. I wish I would have read their Yelp reviews first.< /Text>

This auto mechanic shop is the most honest, lowest price car shop in all of rancho Cucamonga. Ask them about the$100 membership for every 3000 miles, a tire rotation as needed, tire balance/rotations, fluids top offs, 10 percent off future repairs and much more. They also have two convenient locations. I wouldn't take my car anywhere else!<//Text>

Wow, I can't believe the number of poor reviews for A & R!  I have been a customer for 3 years and have always been treated well and charged fairly.  I'm very tough to win over, and am loyal to those who have earned my trust.  Rick, Chris, Katrina and Alan have ALWAYS been prompt, courteous and professional.  A & R does everything that our 4 cars need.  I haven't had to go to the dealer for years (I was oversold and overcharged there)!  So, I'm very happy with A & R and get the same "vibe" from other customers there.  If you're in a hurry, call ahead and ask how busy they are.  Ask questions, if you don't understand something.  I've learned a lot from them and feel much better about the service my cars need and get.  Thanks!</review>

<review>Use at your own risk. I have been bringing my cars here for years and always thought I was being treated fairly and honestly. NOPE!! I had all of my brake shoes, rotors all that jazz replaced 22k miles ago only to be told my drums were over sized and needed to be replaced AGAIN. They ended up doing it for free because there is no way the drums should be needing replacing again so soon. At the time they also replaced the brake booster and Mass Air Flow sensor. I didn't even get out of the parking lot when I noticed my engine light was STILL on and my brake pedal was hitting the floor of the car. How did they think it was ok to send me home like that in a car that clearly wasn't fixed. I made a u-turn and came right back. They had my car another full day and replaced the "bad" brake booster they had just installed. Fast forward two months to today and it's back in the shop. They are replacing the Mass Air Flow sensor they just replaced less than two months ago, again on their dime. Just spoke to them and they are telling me my spark plugs probably need to be replaced soon and that they pulled one and someone put "some cheap one on that they would never use". Ummm....I proceeded to tell them THEY replaced all of them 40k miles ago along with the cables and transmission fluid and charged me $1300. One part going bad I get. It happens, sometimes you get a bad part, but two in less than two months?!?! Bad drums, bad brake booster, bad mass air flow sensor!!!! And now "cheap" spark plugs they would not recommend!!!  I will not be bringing my cars back here ever again for any new work. They are clearly ripping people off.</review>< pictures>

<text>Being an RC resident near Hermosa/Foothill, they are close enough to walk for me in downtime of vehicle maintenance..But they will personally offer  an Uber if walking isn't an option! I have been here several times and honest mechanics are a dime-a-dozen. They offer great service and over-all support on any vehicular problems. Recommend the loyalty program if you drive a lot (Uber/Lyft), $100 for a years worth of oil changes every 3k miles, tire rotation every 6k miles, priority appointments , free tire repair included and 10% off all other services. Thanks again Rick and crew!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Was hung up on multiple times trying to request service through their over priced membership. Many issues were reported with my vehicle that weren't there prior to diagnostic, and magically vanished when I declined repairs and inspected after pick up.

Thought this would be easier oil changes than doing it myself after moving into apartments. They over tightened, and stripped the oil retention bolt on two vehicles, and didn't change filters when it was in the membership agreement to do so. Poor service all around, and no supervisor/owner contact information when requested. Don't waste your funds.<//review>

I'm completely blown away by the bad reviews I've read here! I've been using this place since '86 and my mom used them before me. I've never been scammed or overcharged! I'm not some 'dumb broad' who doesn't know anything about vehicles, by the way, just don't have the tools or backarm to do the work. My son is a mechanic and will look over my vehicles, and if it is something he can't do because of tools or location, he always tells me what I need to get done elsewhere. A&R has NEVER done anything more than what my son has said I needed! I also never told them what my son said. I'm sorry for the bad experiences some of you folks have had, but for me and my family, A&R will ALWAYS have our business!< /text>

Great service- we went to the shop on Hellman next to the DMV and Chris the manager was extremely helpful and kept costs down and was able to get the work done the same day! Honest and reliable service!<//text>

My experience with A & R Tire was good,  the environment was kind the employees were professional and the  waiting area was pleasant with fresh donuts , TV and the other creature comforts we all like.

The hour wait I was informed of for a Tire Alignment was over before I new it ..</review>

I took my truck in two weeks ago for a transmission flush and new filter. I received the quoted price and they were done in less time then the estimated. Great service, no issues, will go back for anything i can't do in my own garage.</review>

The team of guys here were knowledgeable and helpful! They were really busy and understaffed at the front but I would not have known it based on my interaction with them. Funny, professional and above all met my needs in a timely manner!! I will be going back to this location for sure.< /text>

<Text>I went and got a brake inspection and they told me everything was bad I needed to changed my front rotar, brake pads , change brake fluid, clean and adjust rear brakes. Yet when I took it to another mechanic they said everything was fine I only needed to change the brake fluid. Unhonest shop that lies and tries to take money from you. Will never come back or refer anyone to here.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Take your car somewhere else or get a sec opinion. I had my car towed her for a repair. They new they had me, they tried to tell me to fix everything it would be around $8 hundo.  Lol..   Had it towed to another place cause I knew that was BS and I didn't have 8 hundred.   Had it fixed for $2-3 hundred.  Scam!!!!!!!  Most people dont know so they will get u.<//Review>

<Text>Lier,unclear price before you tour the car.The labor fee is very expensive,"install wheel studs left front" is $108.65,"four wheel alignment" is $89.95.

From now on if I have a computer problem I am absolutely stumped with, I know to take it here! Steve took my computer in immediately, correctly diagnosed the issue, cleaned up the laughably bad cable management problem I had, and had it back to me running beautifully in a short manner of time. He is very knowledgeable in what he does and does an excellent job explaining what went wrong in detail. Great value and service<//Text>

< Review>
Steve did a great job replacing my laptop keyboard. During the initial consultation (by email) he correctly diagnosed the problem, sent me a picture of the part I needed, and offered a fair price quote for parts and labor. The repairs were done a couple days after I dropped my computer off and they new keyboard works great. Plus, Steve's shop has an awesome resident cat named Toby, which should be a requirement of every business.< /Review>

<text>Steve was very misleading in the way he handled my business. He offers a discount for a 5 star review after he totally lied when he was giving me a quote. He said that the diagnosis fee is 75 dollars and that would go into the cost of the parts used if I chose to get it repaired by him. Instead of contacting me to ask if I wanted him to repair it, he did it anyways and then changed the blanket price to 175 for any repair. Also he made passive aggressive statements in my choice in a laptop and overall didn't really treat me like a business should treat their customer and will definitely not be returning in the future.</text><response>{'time': 1595833599291, 'text': "Noah, the only misleading treatment going on was you thanking me for saving your computer and posting a positive 5-star rating and then retroactively changing it to a one-star after the fact so who is the liar Noah ???\nNoah, you know very well that I never told you that the $75 diagnostic applied to parts and if you were unclear on that you could have at any time spoke to me about it or expressed a concern to alert me to any discontent.\nSteve's Computer Repair prioritizes customer satisfaction above all else and will go to great lengths to make sure their experience is a positive one even if that means losing a sale.\nIn terms of professional customer service, I have been in business longer than you have been alive and have hundreds of happy customers that have been with me for decades and you sir are a rare exception to that record.\nFurthermore, the only unfair treatment came from you in the form of this very public backstabbing review considering that at no time did you question anything or express any type of discontent, in fact you behaved like you were grateful and quite pleased with the service you received.\nCustomers viewing this review have a right to know that you had every opportunity to express your dissatisfaction and to work out an amicable solution but instead of being a kind, decent, and considerate person you resorted to this very undeserved public display of anger and hate....shame on you!\nThe reviewer Noah Patton has made disingenuous and potential slanderous claims and left out key details that would provide a clear picture that would not look favorable for him...this review should be regarded as sour grapes from a less than honest customer and as such not reflect poorly on the overall character of the business.\n\nPS....I have text messages to prove my point in case anyone should ask furthermore I have this copy of your first 5-Star review before you deceptively changed it:\nMy man Steve didn't waste my time, I just dropped my laptop off and in a few days, it was like it was never broken. He is my go-to guy for fixing my computers. Would recommend to anyone"}< /response><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

<Text>My computer would not turn on and I'm in a real bind.  It's Friday,  2 days before school starts.  I'm a teacher and I desperately need to get docs off my computer.
Motherboard fried!
I call Steve after finding him on my Google search.   He's friendly and willing to take my computer in that day.
He's got a great set up right in his garage (perfectly clean and professional), located minutes from my home.
He was able to download my files and I was up and running on a new laptop by 12:00 Saturday afternoon!
You're a life saver Steve!  Thanks again.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I got to work Monday morning and opened my laptop and found that the screen had cracked sometime over the weekend. The entire screen was one big white out and not usable. OUCH! It was the last week of the month, and I was going to be toast if it did not get fixed right away.

I called Steve and got a good feeling about him over the phone. That's not much to go on, I know, so I was still nervous. Turning my computer over to a stranger, with saved passwords, etc, is usually not a good thing. After bringing my computer to Steve's home shop, I felt much more at ease. I left my computer with him late Monday morning and was able to pick it up Tuesday afternoon which saved by a$$ big time!!!

His rates were very reasonable and his work was exemplary. I now have my "go to" computer guy and will recommend him to my friends and family.

Thanks again for your help Steve!<//text>< Rating>

Great service! I dropped off my laptop for just a screen replacement. Steve informed me that the hard drive was about to give out on me, and that I could lose everything! I ended up having him replace the hard drive, and my laptop is working like new!< /text>

I brought mine in, with the suspicion that it was due to a faulty PSU, and he immediate followed up, tested it with his tools, and we worked together to fix the issue. Great part was when I brought my PC back to get the new PSU I bought installed, he did it for free.

Great service and professional, would highly recommend.< /Review>< Pics>

I contacted this company to see if i could get them to provide a couple if drops of thermal paste for my processor and gpu on my laptop. I explained the laptop would only need to squeeze a couple drops of thermal paste. They said $55. These giys are clowns. I would suggest another storw in fear of being over charged for a simple service. I think 10 dollars is more than enough to cover their tube and the 10 seconds of service they would have provided squeezing a tube of thermal paste.</review>

Dope theater, really clean. Prime One was worth the extra few dollars during matinee pricing, it's AMCs version of IMAX. Parking for the mall is high tech, but you get three hours free if you see a movie. See attached picture for parking pricing.<//Text>

My sister and I love to watch movies. So, we went to this movie house, and we are very happy and satisfied. The room is so big and so cold. The facilities and equipment were great. The staff is all amazing and fantastic. Everything we get there was all affordable, and we loved it. Thank you very much!< /Review>

Disney movie was great, theater was not crowded, Covid careful staff, my AMC membership points were still acculating. Only negatives: Parking wasn't free and nobody was around to answer anything about validating after the movie. Bummer.<//review>

This AMC is a great addition to the Century City mall. My only complaint is that they don’t have the signature recliners in all theaters. Overall though, this is a great theater.<//Review>

This is one of my favorite theaters in Los Angeles area, close to Beverly Hills and the 405 and 10 fwy with plenty of parking space (with free 3 hours validation as a plus or a valet option). Last time, I went to see the Queen story in Bohemian Rhapsody and they had a display with the real costume. As a Hollywood journalist I come here a lot for the movie studios private screenings and that says a lot why they choose this five stars movie theater. By the way... AMC stands for American Multi-Cinema (ask around, and see if people know what you know now!)<//Text>

This is the only movie theatre I go to when I visit Los Angeles.  It’s close to Beverly Hills, so you know it’s quality.  Plus, in addition to great picture and sound, it sometimes gets celebrity guests.  I saw the cast of the ‘Veronica Mars’ movie there during my first visit.<//review>

<Review>Nice and clean theater with parking validation for only 3 hours now, which used to be 4 hours. Prices could be a little cheaper. Imax theater was nice, although I thought it was overpriced. I don't like the concession stand selections. They are all too sugary or salty. There is no healthy options. The workers are okay, except the one who checks tickets could be friendlier. I said hi, and there was silence... No smiles, no hi's, and no friendliness, period. Can the company pay the person a nickel more to be a bit more happier, not to sap the energy out of the guests?<//Review>< Pics>

Great place for a movie. The parking garage is very wide, spacious, and free. Chairs are comfy and the sound is great. And also, a wide variety of food and drinks. The restrooms are clean as well. Service has been all across the board. Hands down one of the best movie house I've ever visited. Highly recommended to everyone I know.< /text>

The air-conditioning is practically non existent. I have been watching movies here for a long time but comfort is not offered. Come here in summer clothes to be comfortable.

Food of course is expensive. Special lines for AMC members. They don't offer the powdered flavors for the popcorn anymore. You have to buy the new flavors ex. Cheddar, caramel etc for much more money.

Audio in certain theaters are way too low. A pretty useless Dolby surround sound. Maybe they need to sound check all their theaters.

The pros
Bathroom is well maintained.
Hot butter for your expensive popcorn.
Validated parking.< /Text>

<Review>Going downhill. The staff used to be chill. The girl that took my ticket stub acted as if I were a leper and she lacks any personality. Perhaps she is tired. When I brought it up to the manager he was also kind of a jerk. All good. Only come here because location is convenient. And they are good at keeping it clean... Lol.

Our favorite place to go to the movies for date night. Clean theater. Friendly staff. Everything is organized and efficient so we can get in and out without any issue. Plenty of bathroom stalls. Lots of places to validate for free parking. Lots of options for comfortable seating from standard to reclined seating. We never have to worry about how tall the person is in front of us.</review>

This is a good location when you’re trying to impress your date. We got served here while watching the movie. I was just impressed by the gesture and Glendale is magical around Christmas. It’s nice to walk around and also grab a coffee and then a movie.< /Text>

FANTASTIC theater one of the best in LA! Recliners available, superior sound and picture quality! Many restaurants in the Century City mall by the theatre and three hour free parking. I was there for five hours and paid $6 for extra 2 hours.</text>

<Review>Not a big fan of the way the seats are set up. I felt like i was in a college auditorium class. Its not convenient people constantly passing over you during the movie it can get a little old. I have been to other AMC theaters and the seating designs were a little better. But the staff is nice and helpful and the snacks were fresh.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Best viewing experience yet. Go to theater 14, the Dolby experience. The clarity of the image is remarkable. The seats recline and it feels like a private screening.</Text>

Our go to movie theater simply for the convenience of it... Plenty of parking and it's validated. Easy to grab dinner before the movie. Huge theater so lines go quickly. $5 Tuesdays. Clean theaters inside. Fast concessions. You name it they have it. We are Stubs Members and take full advantage of it. We love the perks, the slushies, and the points.< /review>

<Review>Watched Bohemian Rhapsody tonight in the prime theater. Great comfortable seats will plenty of room. However, the theater wasn't cleaned prior to the showing. Or at least it didn't look like it.  Cup holders had trash on them , popcorn was thrown on the floor and the seats we sat on had popcorn. Not a huge deal, but enough to point it out. Screen looked great and the sound was just as great. Sound was clean and bass was low and thumping. The men's bathroom was a bit on the disgusting side. One of the urinals was clogged and urine had overflowed.< /Review><user>115295861258670731176<//user><user_name>Carlos A Ramirez</user_name>< Pictures>

<text>Tickets are crazy expensive (such is getting to be the movies these days), so yes they do validate for parking, but it's clean and well run and safe. Can be difficult to get to the theater depending on where you park, so just leave enough time for the start of the movie if you have to cross through the mall or something. Bathrooms seem to be pretty clean. Have been a few times and overall the facility is nice and it's a great place to meet up with friends.</text><user>112596426975588897934< /user><date>1551404233865< /date><name>jenalomba< /name><Rate>5</Rate><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Great surrounding and environment. Clean and not so crowded. The concession area is a bit smaller compared to other AMCs but it's very comfortable inside. There's an escalator that takes you up to the theatres and don't forget to validate your parking!<//text>

Nice, clean, big theatre. I prefer the Dolby theatre for action films. Seats recline, vibrate with the movie, etc. The IMAX theatre is nice also. Prices are kind of steep. They validate parking. The mall is pretty nice (actually really nice).</Review>

<review>It's one of the best AMC cinemas in L.A. since they have Prime 3D, Dolby Screen & IMAX in same building. Also it's 15 screens, So options are really good for other movies.
The view from the Top of Mall is Nice since it's next to Cool Art, unique restaurants.
The only downfall is parking has to be validated since it's inside if the Century Mall.
So you have to make sure you take the ticket to the scanner they have on the walls there, at least they have easy access for them.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2bb8b8914cd5f:0x21ea1b492668c574< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I've been to this movie theater several times already.  Great place to watch Korean and American block bluster hits with subtitles.  There's no waiting in massive lines, free 4 hour parking with validation, friendly, and courteous staffs, comfy seats...I'm down.  the only downfall is that they show a few selections since they only have 3 screens.< /Text>< Pictures>

Despite the general disposition of the atmosphere and the crowds, I found the mall and the surrounding area quite pleasant. The theater is the only real draw for me outside of the all the restaurants. Eataly is quite something on its own. More to come in the review as I visit accordingly.< /Text>

Amazing theater, clean, and high tech! Checked out an early showing of Captain Marvel. The sound was insane and rumbled the reclining chairs! That Mall is a beautiful place so we took an afternoon stroll through after the movie let out. New to the area and I'll no doubt become a regular at this place.<//text>

<review>This theater keeps movies a little longer than Burbank AMC 16 and it is also very big. Free parking is validated for the first 3 hours, no lines and their small screens still feel big. I saw Creed 2 here last night and it was still as good as the bigger theaters. Highly recommend it and the staff were helpful directing me throughout such a big place.< /review>< Rating>

Love this movie theater. Just moved to the area and have been checking out local theaters to find my ‘home’ location. This was hits all the boxes and more. Have always been an avid movie-goer but more so at my local Cinemark. Coming into this AMC though makes the experience so much better! It’s really up to date and nice. Tickets run around the $16-$17 range but ever since I got the AMC A-LIST membership that’s no worry at all!!! I love it, this theater and program is great!< /Text>

<Text>Rude and obnoxious people. Almost everytime I come to the theater its a bad experience. Twice I reserve my seats and when we show up random people are occupying them. Even the manager couldnt do anything about it. Another time a big family shows up and starts yelling, singing along, laughing obnoxiously, and answer the phone to have a full blown conversation in the theater. I understand small children but these are full grown people. The remodeling of the theater is amazing and its sad because its a great and local location. But id rather drive somewhere else to enjoy my movie experience.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Great place to watch a movie after some shopping. The theaters are kept pretty clean and they offer many different movie options (digital, IMAX, AMC Prime). They also validate parking, so it drops the parking price to about $1.50 if you're just coming for the movie. I would recommend not getting food unless if you really want it because the portion sizes are not worth the price.< /review>

Not as nice and clean as the amc in Westfield Santa Anita but still better than any regal or arclight cinema.  The theater where our movie was showing has seats that are a bit uncomfortable.  They are not the updated leather recliner seats yet.</text>

There are two levels to the theater and they have a snack bar station on both levels. The nice thing about this location is you can go shopping while waiting to go to the movies.Also, make sure to validate before you leave! The validating machine is upstairs and they can be a little weird about going back up if you forget to validate.</Text>< Pictures>

Best viewing experience yet. Go to theater 14, the Dolby experience. The clarity of the image is remarkable. The seats recline and it feels like a private screening.</Review>

<Text>The mall is Fantastic! So many shops and places to eat and lounge. Really clean and beautiful.  I rated it 3 stars because the parking lot is beyond confusing. There aren't any clear signs of where you are in relation to the mall which is Huge, and if you are someone who has trouble walking, this is a real issue. On top of that, when I was there around 7 PM, there was no one to even ask for guidance on where to find our car when we basically got lost in the parking lot. Not One security guard. Especially in today's world, that made me feel really not safe there if there was an emergency.  Overall, though, barring the parking's poor design, great mall and worth a visit.</Text>< Pics>

The parking and location of this theater is pretty convenient, with it being in a mall. Can be expensive for their premium tickets, but that's LA. The theater is large enough that you'll usually get a few Indies tossed in with the Blockbusters. Dolby showings are highly recommended, the experience can't be beat!< /Text>

Does not have reclining seats but it's very clean and professional.  I especially enjoyed the comfortable temperature not like other theaters where it's an ice box and I'm not exaggerating.  I've almost did not agree to come to the theater due to ice cold temperature but I was very happy with the AMC Century City 15 and therefore enjoyed the movie even more.  4 stars due to over charged parking.</Review>

<review>Very clean and fancy movie theater. Plenty of self service kiosks in the lobby, staff were all very friendly, and nothing looked out of place. The theaters themselves were also spacious and clean with excellent effects. Only complaint would be the high prices and line cutting options for higher tier members.</review>< user_id>

<text>Nice place to see a movie.  The mall is very nice.  Lots of good food near the theatre.  The Dolby movie experience is a must. Well worth the extra couple bucks.<//text>< pics>

A bit hectic but I did appreciate the premier line available. It definitely cut our wait time in concessions down.< /review>

AMC Century City is one of my favorite theaters to go to. I had made a purchase through an app to see a movie last night and thought I had selected this theater... I apparently did not. The customer service rep (a gentleman with curly hair) last night was so helpful and kind, we got to see the movie and even though I felt like a dunce it was cut short because of how understanding he was.< /review>

< Review>
I have been going to this theater since I was a kid, back when it was on the other side of the mall. This theater still brings me back. If not for Movie Pass, we might not be going here anymore however. The prices of tickets are quite high. I get that this AMC is a flagship for the company, but a movie is a movie.
The food here is a bit pricey but is just like any other movie theater you might go to. The theater is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful.< /Review>

Awful place. People are unfriendly and very rude. They made my 16 year old leave a movie where I bought the tickets and walked her to the theater. During the movie they went in and took her and her friend out when they had done nothing wrong. They literally made them leave the theater and then simply left them. They were then stranded at the mall with no ride. It is unacceptable. Also, they refused to give us a refund. I strongly don’t recommend this theater and they have awful prices and awful food. If I could give them 0 stars I would.</Text>

The Carmel was a lot better than the cheesy popcorn but even the cheesy popcorn was still pretty good. I think the only problem with the cheesy popcorn was that it was a little bit stale. Maybe it was a little bit warmer or a bit fresher I would have liked it more, but again the caramel corn was excellent.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This spacious theatre located in the prestigious mall offers comfortable seating and a variety of popular films along with a selection of foods, snacks and beverages to enjoy during the film. Well managed and secure, you won't find troublemakers here. Simply relax and enjoy the film.< /Review>

<review>Saw a movie for the first time here today. Staff was nice at the concession stand. The price is higher than other AMC’s in the area but it is a nice atmosphere with the very nice mall. I used my MP so it didn’t really sway my decision. I was disappointed though that there was no typical AMC recliner seating. I don’t think it applies for all the screens but at least the one.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This theatre is fine for what it is. But it is very much behind the times. Almost every other modern theatre is upgrading to recliner seats and in theatre dining. It's almost the only way to experience a movie now-a-days. This theatre feels outdated and therefore makes the experience of seeing a movie less than stellar.</Review>

<userid>111900802092761649293< /userid><review>I went to this location last night for the PGA screening of "Knives Out".  I walked over to the Guest Services and asked a young male hispanic worker there, I think with glasses (I didn't get his name unfortunately) if they had food at this location (as not every theater has food), to which he replied sarcastically "yeeessss" and with a smug grin, then I asked "ok, where is it, I don't see it on this floor?", then he said "... at concessions", then I said "ok, so where is concessions", then he looked "where your theater screens are", then I said "ok, where are the screens?" (they are not on that floor), then he said "above and below us".  I was so mad at his sarcastic tone, why not just say "yes sir, we have food at concessions on the floor above and below here", simple.   Disgusted with that attitude, not "Guest Services" at all, ruined my good feeling going into there and tainted my experience of watching the movie as I kept thinking about it.</review>< date>

One of the best movies theaters in L.A.! The premium options (IMAX, Dolby, and Prime) make for the best movie experience you can get.< /review>

Saw a movie for the first time here today. Staff was nice at the concession stand. The price is higher than other AMC’s in the area but it is a nice atmosphere with the very nice mall. I used my MP so it didn’t really sway my decision. I was disappointed though that there was no typical AMC recliner seating. I don’t think it applies for all the screens but at least the one.<//review>

This location is efficient, but extremely unorganized.  The theater is very loud (sound system) without quality and balance of sound.  The seating is average.< /Text>

It’s a pretty impressive theater. They often have displays of items or costumes from the movies being featured. The Dolby theater has reclining seats. They also validate parking. The only thing missing is maybe a bar, but there’s plenty of restaurants right outside the theater.< /Review>

<Review>This is my go to spot for watching movies. The best experience here is AMC Dolby. The reclining seats are the best thing to happen to movie theaters since popcorn. The 8k laser projector makes it feel like the movie is a giant super duper hd flat screen. I love this movie and free 3 hour parking is a huge plus!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2bb8b8914cd5f:0x21ea1b492668c574</GmapID></record>

I love this movie theater. It is definitely pricey, as most movie theaters in Los Angeles are, but I enjoy coming here to grab a bite to eat at the many restaurants within Westfield and watching a movie right after or before. They always have great customer service and tons of movie times that just work.

As I mentioned, it is a little pricey, especially in the evenings. If you are able to purchase discounted tickets elsewhere, I highly recommend you do to save about $5 which can go towards your pricey popcorn. I am able to get my Gold tickets from work, however, using them at this particular location will include a $2 surcharge.

Don't forget your parking ticket for validation! AMC validates for up 4 hours for free I believe. If not, you'll end up paying about $4+ once you leave the movie.</Text>

This AMC offiers IMAX, PRIME, along Dolby with the standard digital and 3D showings. AMC A-List pass makes the experience super convenient, fun, and stress-free. Two different concession stands so the lines are never too long. The staff could be a little more friendly IMO but overall its a great cinema.</review>

<Text>Good theater with quality picture, but AMC commits age discrimination in their hiring. Proven by interviews at 4 theaters with middle-age applicants not hired. Try applying for a job there if you're over 40. Look around the theater, they only hire people under 20.</Text>< Rating>

The seats were comfy but I can’t get over how scammy it feels for the regular popcorn to cost 8$ and the large 9$ which is essentially 3 times larger! Movie theaters need to stop with this basically forcing you to get the larger size it’s unhealthy!< /Text>< pictures>

Despite having reserved seats, it turned out that 1 of the seats (we were in a group of 4) became unusable because it got wet during the previous showing. There were no other desirable seats available as this particular showtime was sold-out & 2 of us had to split up & sit in the front 3rd row (which ironically was something we had expressly said that we did not want (i.e. to be seated so close to the screen)). It's unfortunate that this happened, & to make matters worse, we had to wait over 30 minutes to get matters resolved & missed the beginning of the movie. The AMC staff was kind enough to offer us 2 free tickets for the next time, which we hope will be without problems. But this is something for AMC to think about given that having reserved seating means a specific number of seats, so what do you do when those "reserved" seats become unusable.<//review>

It's a very nice theater. But the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's doesn't have the recliner seats. I also felt that it was a little bit pricey without the recliner seats at almost $17 a ticket. It is reserved seating. They also validate your parking.<//review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>This theater is probably the nicest on the west side. It's also really expensive for movie tickets. There is assigned seating which can be nice. Lots of theater rooms so there's also lots of options in terms of choosing a screening time. They offer validation on parking with their machines located throughout the theater. It's located at the Century City mall so it can get pretty busy during weekends and peak hours.

Parking is plentiful, but may require some time to drive through the many levels of their parking garage during peak hours.

Overall a good theater aside from the price.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Based on other reviews I thought that there were reclining seats, but not all the theater's have them and you won't know till you get there. Especially after paying $17, I was very disappointed<//review>

This theatre claims to validate parking and when you go to leave the garage you find out the ticket is in fact not validated. So plan on spending an additional $5+ anytime you see a movie here, absolutely not worth it.<//Review>

$18.50 for 3D Real D, is about right compared to other theaters in the area. Located next to an enormous food court, you are in the midst of a large selection before or after the feature. The staff are competent and very friendly. There are usually many double and triple seats available when you select them when buying a ticket. Floor isn't sticky and restrooms are located centrally to all the screens. Snacks are overpriced but that's normal for a theater.</review>

Nice multiplex theater with more than 15 theaters including IMAX and Dolby and real D 3D. Food options are interesting, they offer run crust pizza. Also they give you a cup and direct you to Coke dispensers where you select your favor and type of soft drink (ie lime diet Coke, vanilla Cherry Coke, etc.) Seats are pretty good, and recline when you lean backwards (as opposed to power seat adjustments)< /Text>

<Review>This theater is clean and has the lastest technology for video and audio. AMC has even upgraded the concession stand to include so many different eating/snacking options. Great thing is if you have a movie pass and you get there a little early for tickets, you can grab a bite in the food court. So many options at the mall!</Review>< Pics>

Not enough people covering the concession stand. 1 guy taking orders cooking food. Felt bad for the kid. Also the way you buy tickets is a little rough all automated needed someone to come over and scan my card. AMC needs to pick up the customer service at century city. Management needs to give these employees some support.</Text>

Another LA cinema that looks very pretty. The second floor houses its own stadiums and concession space. Everything is clean and efficient, but feels tightly packed in. Reserved seating would make it even better!<//review>

Guest Services was a bit rude to my friend (seemed unprofessional). The snack selection was very limited. I wish they had a larger variety of chips and other items, or at least allowed you to bring outside food after paying some sort of fee (I didn't even try as I know most movie theaters aren't okay with that).< /review>

<Review>Not enough people covering the concession stand. 1 guy taking orders cooking food. Felt bad for the kid. Also the way you buy tickets is a little rough all automated needed someone to come over and scan my card. AMC needs to pick up the customer service at century city. Management needs to give these employees some support.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I love AMC, I go to different ones to just to see the difference. Nothing tops the Montebello AMC so far. This one has basic seats, no recliners, and sometimes when a movie is long you’re stuck paying for parking. It’s the one nearest me so I’m here often.</review>

<review>This is THE go-to movieplex on the Westside with several offerings and different formats to pick from. You gotta love the $5 movie Tuesdays for members and now that they're competing head on with MoviePass and Sinemia this has become the ultimate destination for movies. Lastly, the theaters are located right next to the mall food court if you're planning a dinner and movie date night.< /review><name>Elias Khoury</name>< resp>

I reserved two tickets a few days before. I planned on being 15 minutes late to avoid the ads and the trailers. When I tried to get my tickets I it printed out tickets that read, We're sorry you're late. Please see ticket services." When I go inside the line is really long. When i complained about having to wait in line to get my tickets one guy said to me, "I can have you thrown out of here at any time".

This is not how I expect to be treated at a theater.< /text>

I went there on New Year Day... long lines, dirty theater's. Standing in line for popcorn, and there was a "preferred  line" where people could just walk up and get their food, LIKE I WAS NOT STANDING THERE!! NOT COOL!! I'm born and raised in WLA, and I use TO love going to Century City...No so much any more. I go to the movies at least 3 times a month....AMC...no!  I'll GO to the Bridge in Culver City...always clean!!! Shame on you AMC!</review>

Saw a private prescreening here. Very modern theatre in a very modern mall. The 3D isn't as good as 4k IMAX laser, how ever as far as the average movie theatre goes this one is pretty good. Parking cost me $8 after validation which seemed a bit steep.< /Review>

If you see a matinee movie then parking is easy. If you see a later movie parking can be a nightmare. The theater is fine, dolby seating is awesome< /text>

Good quality theater. Just saw start wars here. We had a problem where Fandango double sold our tickets, and when we complained to the customer service desk he gave us the option to get free vouchers or to get new seats</Review>

Best Cinema in Los Angeles by far. The Dolby Cinema and the IMAX 3D have an exquisite experience which will have a lasting effect in how you tend to watch movies. My expectations from cinemas are now benchmarked at this specific one.< /Review>

The manager Ashley changes her stories on AMC policies and does not understand that "the customer is always right." Ashley has no integrity in her profession and even accused us of lying multiple times. An establishment, such as AMC theaters, should have the utmost respect for their customers and deliver solutions to their employee issues that were caused. No employees were at the guest services or the box office on the night of the film, so we came back the next evening and Ashley decided to give no service with issues from the night before. Ashley needs to be fired and replaced with a person that can treat their customers with integrity and full service. Someone that can represent AMC theaters and not ashley that speaks to us with no respect.<//Review><name>Joseph S.< /name><Date>1479447542197< /Date><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>I love this theater, however, the only problem I have is that they only comp you three hours on your parking.......if you want to see a movie and have a coffee......they don't give you enough time.  Other than that, it is easy in and out, clean and a friendly staff.....plus the popcorn is not half bad!</text>< Pics>

The theater can be better, all but one room is updated, the rest have old seats that do not recline. But hopefully the fix this place up like a Cinemark. The real perk of this AMC is that it's located in the Westfield of Century City.< /review>

Great movie selection and location. The only less than optimal aspect was the seats, which aren’t the reclining leather ones that have been installed into a lot of the other AMC Theaters in the area. Don’t forget to get your parking validated before exiting the theater!< /text>

One of the better theaters around; great mall to boot.  Parking is easy if you go in the back parking lot.  Little on the pricey side for tickets.< /text>

<Review>The Dolby Cinema here is outstanding! The quality of a film's presentation and the environment you experience it in have a profound impact on your immersion into a story. For hard core movie fans this is a no brainier. Dolby has really put together an impressive rival to IMAX. Not all auditoriums are made equal, and this relatively new installation knocks it out of the park. I recommend center asile in row E for the best viewing. The duel 4k projectors and Dolby Atmos sound really thrust you into the story. The screen is large and if you get great seats, the image takes up most of your field of view. Check this out, it's more than worth the extra bucks.<//Review>< Rating>

We took our daughter to see Unbroken and were appalled to see a preview for 50 Shades of Grey before our PG-13 movie.  Other families had their younger children with them. Who at AMC thought it was appropriate to preview a sexually deviant movie before family entertainment?</text>

It cost me $8 to see the 11AM show at this fine theater,  and parking was free with a validation.  Excellent!<//review>

<review>Not a fan of this theater -- the walls of the other theaters are so thin that sound from the other theaters will leak into the one you're in and on top of that they crank the volume up way too high. My ears really hurt the last time I went.

Validated parking is a plus, but if you're past the allotted time, the penalty is quite high.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The manager was ignorant and acted like a robot, unreasonable on 2p 3/4/18.
He refused to give me credit on my credit card which I presented him with the receipt instead  gave me pass
I hope you provide enough, decent training so they can do their job better</text>

< review>
The tickets for standard theatre seating are more expensive than at luxury theatres nearby, like the Landmark at the Pavillion. The large popcorn does not come with the expected free refill unless you're a member, so it's  $9 price seems even more outrageous. Then I had to sit through 25 minutes of trailers, 2 of which were ads for the theatre itself, which is more than i ever remember sitting through in any theatre. Finally, they only offer parking validation for 3 hours. My movie had a 2h 35min runtime, so when you add in the trailers I was already over the 3 hour grace period and had to pay for parking. You can find lower prices with higher quality in many other places. I won't be coming back and will shy away from any amc theatre in general.</review>

Large stadium-style theaters.  All projectors are digital and output at 4K.  They've also got a couple IMAX 3D theaters that are pretty nice.  Seats are fair comfortable but not the best in the industry.</Text>

Dreadful service.  I and a friend went and despite the MPAA's ratings not being law, they have decided those under the age of 18 can't go without an adult.  This is a cash grab policy allowing them to forcing those like myself to purchase another ticket for our guardian.  The creme de la creme was when my friend and I unknowingly started watching the movie a swat team of amc employees came to escort us out.  To get a refund after this dreadful service took another 30 minutes due to the fact that there was no employee manning the refund station.  We then waited in the long line for tickets just to ask an employee to man the refund station.  As a very frequent customer (I go to at least 3 movies a month), I can tell you that I personally will not be returning to this theater any time soon.  Even in the heart of LA where competition is fierce they still have the audacity to abuse their customers in the hope they can extort them for more money on top of the already non competitive ticket pricing.
In short, today AMC lost a valuable customer and I hope, many many more.< /Text>

Ever since I moved to LA 10+ years ago, this theater has always held a high standard of quality. I cant say this is the case for all AMC theaters, but this one in particular makes the movie going experience worth the money, somewhat at least.
I can rant about movie ticket prices but as far as what you get for your money, AMC PRIME in particular is the only thing keeping the movie going experience worth the increasing prices. At 20 dollars a ticket, it may seem steep, but you get wide, comfortable reclining seats and some of the most amazing sound you will probably experience in your movie going career. 20 dollars isn't that bad if you consider that a regular auditorium ticket will run you about 18 dollars.
Snacks aren't any better here than they are at any other movie theater.
It being located at a Westfield's mall, and the century city Westifeld's at that, you can save yourself from buying overpriced mediocre movie food and hit up any of the multiple restaurants and food court eateries before or after the movie.<//text>

One of my favorite AMC's .  I love the smell of pop corn when I walk in.  The speedy lines...well I like to use the self kiosks and go straight to the concession stand, and make my way to the movie room.  Staff is awesome, and some of them are gorgeous!</review>

<time>1420053914732< /time><rating>2</rating><Review>My family and I were at the AMC theaters in Century City.  During the movie, the lights went on and there was an emergency evacuation of the building.  We left the building.  No one was at our exit to tell us what happened or if it was safe to return -so we walked home.  I immediately emailed AMC to report the incident and ask for advice for a refund.  After a few days and no response, I called the theater and left a message.  Though the recording said that they would return my phone call, they did not.  I had to make a special trip to AMC to talk to customer service.  She did give me passes to cover my tickets.  Only when I mentioned how disappointed I was in AMC did she begrudgingly offer me a "I'm sorry for the inconvenience".  I give AMC 2 stars, because at least they compensated me for the tickets I bought-but why did I have to beg to get them to do the right thing?< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>The theater itself is a great movie going experience. AMC Prime is my favorite way to watch movies. The ticket prices are a bit higher, but the theater is well kept and well run. I would easily give my review a perfect score but there are two things that negatively affect the experience, that are in no ways the theater's fault.

First is the parking, as it gets really crowded in the parking lots, especially on weekends, it can become an adventure trying to remember when and where you parked. The new parking system does tell you where you parked, but it only helps if you know their letter/number layout. The second, which also greatly adds to the first, are the technology "inexperienced" patrons (a Bill/Becky) who do not grasp the concept of the ticket kiosks and never pay for parking. Regardless of how slow it may be, it is guaranteed there will be a person who complains about the kiosks as they buy tickets from the guest services counter when you need them for something that the kiosks cannot do, and someone who didn't pay for parking as you try to exit the garage. It is a 100% guarantee that the one time you need guest services, and everytime you try to leave the garage, there will be at least one person who did not use the technology (designed to prevent those exact situations) and creates a long line. I have been coming to this mall for over a decade, and at this AMC almost weekly for over the past 5 years; it is a guarantee Bill or Becky didn't use the kiosk and now there's a line.

Again, I love this theater, but the Bill and Beckys will hold you up everytime and for the most "mundane" reason. It is hilariously inconvenient, and seemingly impossible how much of a guarantee it is that it will happen.

TLDR
+Extremely well kept and well run theater
+AMC Prime Screen
+Intuitive Automated Machines allows for fast and efficient ticket purchasing and concessions experience

- Parking can get complicated
- Technologically "inexperienced" patrons (Bills/Beckys) are guaranteed to create a hold up if you need to talk to a theater employee and when you are exiting the parking lot.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>I liked the theater, although getting to your movie is a bit confusing being that it's a 3 level theater. It's weird !! Another downside is the pricing of the movies. $16 for adults and $12 for kids is absolutely ridiculious ! Also parking was a pain in the butt!! Would I drive that far to ever come back here ? Hmm maybe not.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bb8b8914cd5f:0x21ea1b492668c574<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I love my AMC and am pleased as punch with the new parking lot!  I haven't been late to a movie since they opened AND I always park so I can walk right into the entrance .. boo yah!  AMC is the good old workhorse that does the job and doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles.  They modernized it a few year years ago with a move to the current facility but it just feels old.  Maybe because they all look alike <snicker> so when your in one AMC you can be in just about ANY AMC.  But you just can't complain about the convenience of a theatre right in the middle for my friends and I to meet up.  It's also pretty nice that they still validate so you only have to pay $3 ... well I'm complaining a whee bit since it used to be you could see a movie and not pay for parking if you timed it right but Westfield put the kabosh on that!</Review>

Staff is nice, facilities are nice, but they charge fees for using AMC gold tickets and parking isn't a good deal even after validating. Also i wish they had a bar inside like many other AMCs do now. The Dolby Cinema is excellent though and worth the extra money for HDR laser projection and Atmos sound!<//review>

If you want bad customer service go ask for the general manager hector ortiz. This guy does not care about his job and does not care to help anyone, asked him a simple question he was too busy to look me in the eye or answer my question. This guy should be fired, who made this guy the manager ?< /review>

<text>Two words. Dolby. Cinema. By far the best theater in the West LA-Westwood-Century City area. The theater is located in a posh mall with plenty of variety in terms of shopping experience and food options (they just added an Eataly). The theater itself is very clean, and well maintained. The snack lines are usually pretty quick no matter the crowd size (snack-tenders move quickly and efficiently). Theaters are clean and give you the option of standard format, IMAX, IMAX 3-D, or my personal favorite, the Dolby Cinema. For about $5-$10 extra you get seated in a lazy-boy style chair with mechanized reclining and foot rest options so you can lounge comfortably while watching your favorite flick (great for longer movies and worth the extra dollars in my opinion, saw Star Wars Rogue One twice in this theater). The sound quality in the Dolby Cinema is exceptional and the picture, I believe, is wide-screen with tremendous color rendering. There is a Gelson's just below the theater as well, so if the snack bar doesn't have what you are looking for, Gelson's may be able to fill in the gaps. The theater also validates for parking. Again, best theater in the local area. Dolby Cinema 4 lyfe.</text>< Pics>

<Review>A big theater with top and bottom floors plus a lounge to hang out and buy snacks while the movie hasnt started. Its a really nice theater and it doesnt get ridicously packed like other places do which is a plus. Overall I enjoyed my movie here! The theaters very clean and well taken care of with helpful staff members. If your by this area and want to catch a movie heres the best place!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><user>109863424254048226639< /user><response>None<//response>< name>

< Review>
This is my go to theater in Los Angeles, and it should be for anyone reading this if they want a premium viewing experience.  There are only THREE AMC theaters in southern california that have dolby cinema with the more advanced RGB laser projection.  The AMC in Burbank, this one in Century City, and the one in Torrance.  This is far and away the best LOOKING experience I've come across in the theater.  I typically only go to see tentpole movies that are higher on the visual spectacle scale.  The marvel movies, the star wars, star treks, etc etc, and the last thing I want to see is washed out color and terrible contrast.

This theater has brighter highlights and richer colors, and deeper blacks, looking at a space scene looks better here than almost all other theaters in the area.  Sound is great, and it benefits from the fact that the auditorium is not TOO large.  That is my problem with the Chinese theater in Hollywood, you often get seats so far back that even though the projection is good, the screen can get quite small.  That and the acoustics of that theater are not as good as the more modern theaters designed from the ground up for movies like the amc dolby venues.

Seats are supremely comfortable, I recently saw a movie at my old go to theater (Cinemark) and it felt like I was packed into a sardine can in comparison.  AMC spoiled me with the Prime theater rooms, you do not have to deal will fellow movie goers flowing over their own seats onto you because there is just more space.

I hope AMC and other theaters continue to expand these high end laser projection venues.  It really is superior, and if you are going to see a spectacle style movie, it makes zero sense to view such a thing on a low rent theater screen in my opinion.  If anyone does decide to check this theater out or one of the other AMC theaters in the area, try to get tickets to the dolby theater version of the movie you want to see.  That is only one I know of that uses laser projection.<//Review>

<Review>Comfy seats, validated parking, abundance of screens. You could do a lot worse to catch a screening. I've seen a lot of free prerelease movies here and it's always been a positive experience. After watching e3 here last year i spent 45 mins with some friends and random strangers tallong about the event and they let us stay there talking the whole time, so the stafff and security aren't toxic.< /Review>< Pictures>

I came here to see the new Alice in Wonderland movie and the only theater available at they time we wanted was the IMAX 3D.  I have to say... WOW!  The 3D effects in IMAX are so much better that the other 3D options.  I would say that IMAX 3D is the only one worth the premium price theaters are charging now for the 3D option.

Even though I'm not much of a soda drinker, I appreciate that the AMC has installed the self-serve soda & Icee machines.<//Review>

<text>Parking is not adequate but the worst part is that they do not warn the customers and just keep letting cars in so it becomes a free for all inside for 30-40mins. We missed our movie even though we arrived early. Not worth it.<//text><user_name>Roberto Murguia< /user_name>< Pictures>

It was fairly clean and even for a friday late night, it wasnt too crowded, something I really enjoy compared to the east coast Washington DC area. Prices are the same as well.  Its expected.  This isnt some cheap mall either, give Westfield some respect.<//Review>< pics>

Nice enough theater, and it's in a great location, but it's definitely not at the top of my list. I don't like that you have to chose a seat before you enter, and the arrangement of the theaters and concession stands is a bit weird.</Text>

A step above most AMC Theaters, much cleaner and with more diverse programming. Reserved seating can sometimes be a pain - so make sure to grab your tickets online first to get some good seats.< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>It's a large, clean theater with good screens and sound.  This used to be a great AMC, but then they started raising the prices through the roof.  They actually have a $2 surcharge at this location if you try to use the prepurchased gold tickets (obtained through costco or workplace discounts). Other AMCs don't charge you that. Plus you'll still be charged for parking even if you validate. That combined with their already high $12+ movie tickets, $4+ surcharge for 3D, $4+ surcharge for digital, $4+ surcharge for IMAX (they don't have a real 60ft IMAX screen, but they charge for it anyway) and it's really not worth it.

Then they start playing dozens of commercials before the movie starts. Of all the theaters I've been to, this one plays the most commercials. It's ridiculous.

You get to preselect your seats when you pay, but that's the only perk I noticed from this overpriced AMC. For the price, you might as well just go to Arclight. At least you get a nice intro by a staff member and they don't bombard you with ads. It's actually cheaper to go there and you get a better experience.<//text>< Pics>

One of the best movie theaters on the Westside! Parking is easy! although sometimes it's worse then the 405 during rush hour trying to get in or out! The Outside of the movie theater is great and the inside get's better. The Theater is 3 floors but only 2 of the floors are used to show movies. The huge disappointment is, in my opinion, the IMAX room isn't really a IMAX. The screen is smaller compared to the other IMAX places i've been to. The best i think is in Universal City Walk. The theater can get crowded with all the annoying school kids but Overall it's a really nice movie theater.< /Text>

I usually buy prepaid tickets through my work to save some money, i buy both, the silver and gold passes. The silver tickets are for movies older than 2 weeks and the gold tickets are for new releases, the tickets are to be used without any further charges from the theater unless 3D movie will be watched. Last time i visited the theaters in Burbank, CA, they they made me pay $2 per ticket even thought i had the gold tickets and the movie was not a 3D movie. I told them that that was unfair because that money was paid to AMC theaters in advance and therefore they should honor the ticket as they were advertised, as an adimission ticket to watch a movie. They said there were sorry, but I had to pay the $ 2 per ticket if i wanted to see the movie. Now I am stuck with 100 tickets and i have to use them paying extra money in addition to what i already paid, even though they were meant to be used as an admission ticket, now it is kind of a discount to the admition ticket.
To me this type of service is unacceptable regardless of how good the theater or the movies are, this is called NOT GOOD BUSINESS ETHICS.
On the other hand i do understand the corporation if they want to raise the prices of the tickets, they have the right to do so, but they should make new tickets and sell them at a new price. But they should keep on honoring the old tickets without making us pay extra money for tickets that were purchaced thinking it will garanteed the admission to the theater.
I am going to ask them to reimburst my money, and if they don't want to do it, i probably end up taking them to court.
I AM ASKING EVERYBODY THAT READ THIS COMMENT TO HELP ME BOYCOTT AMC THEATERS, USE OTHER THEATERS, THEY PRETTY MUCH DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH THE CONSUMMERS.. AND THIS NEEDS TO STOP, THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL REALIZE THAT THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG IS WHEN THEY START HURTING FROM LOSING BUSINESS.
THANK YOU!</Text>

They only validate (I think) 2-2.5 hours for the underground parking. Pulled into the garage just minutes before Avengers Infinity War (2 hrs 29 mins) started and we still had to pay $3 for parking even with validation.< /Text>

<Review>The theater is good, accept for the assigned seating, it makes spur of the moment movie trips dissapointing (when you are asked to pay full price for the s#ittiest seats in the house it's time to leave), and the parking is terrible you should get free parking regardless of how long you stay with a movie ticket validation.<//Review>< date>

< review>
I used to watch movies here a lot.  It has been awhile and I really love the improvements, especially the seats in the Dolby theater.  However, unlike other theaters where they have begun lowering the price of concessions, this theater absurdly overcharges for sub-par quality food.  They only have small and large popcorn sizes, so get ready to shell out the extra dollar for the large.  Only a dollar?  Yes, but recognize this.  The small is $8, and the large is $9.  This is fine if you wanna splurge, so I decided to get a large popcorn.  I should have tasted it before I went to my seats, but the movie was about to start.  It was so salty and was definitely not freshly popped.  I think they added the extra salt to dress up yesterday's popcorn.  After the movie, I went back and asked them about it.  They wouldn't and asked me to wait 10 minutes for the next batch.  They could not validate my parking so I had to press the intercom at the gate.  This experience could have been much better, but it was just a hassle and more ordeals than I normally deal with going to movies elsewhere.  I read an earlier review that states friendly staff and I have to disagree.< /review>

<review>The prices at this theatre are absolutely insane. I paid $16 dollars for a single ticket to a normal movie. Nothing special. The only way this is worth it is if you have a movie pass, but then it's still just a normal theatre.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Haven't been to AMC in about a year, and was shocked by the increase in ticket prices.  Over $40 for a couple of tickets was enough for me to make a 180 out the door.  Went to Landmark theater, took a bottle of wine, and saved $10 dollars in the process.  Shame on you AMC.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2bb8b8914cd5f:0x21ea1b492668c574</gmapID>< date>

<text>Haven't been to AMC in about a year, and was shocked by the increase in ticket prices.  Over $40 for a couple of tickets was enough for me to make a 180 out the door.  Went to Landmark theater, took a bottle of wine, and saved $10 dollars in the process.  Shame on you AMC.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Seats are horrible. Feels like there is a wooden crossbar going along your back. Literally one of the worst I've ever been to. Painful back experience.<//Review>

Do NOT go to this movie theater. It is unsafe. The fire alarm went off and the audience filed out through the outside exit doors only to discover that the exits had been walled off. There were over 100 people trapped in an outdoor hallway with NO EXIT!</review>

(Translated by Google) The customer service of those in charge of the sale of sodas 🥤 ... etc ... have a frightful and unpleasant service, I do not understand why before putting people like that with a bad attitude in front of a counter, they should teach them how to take care of How to provide excellent service. I loved AMC but the attitudes of the staff are appalling.

(Original)
El servicio al cliente de los encargados de la venta de sodas 🥤 🍿 etc... tienen un espantoso y desagradable servicio, no entiendo porqué antes de poner a gente así con pésima actitud en frente de un mostrador, deberían darles clase de cómo atender de cómo brindar un excelente servicio. Yo amó AMC pero las actitudes del personal son pésimas.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The emergency exit lights are so intense that they cast shadows of sheets and railings on the silver screen being screened. The precious Dolby Cinema is ruined. Doesn't AMC feel embarrassed about this situation? Or is it making a fool of the customer? However, the sound is so good that it is a star 3.

(Original)
非常口の明かりは強烈で、上映中の銀幕にシートや手すりの影を落とすほど酷い。せっかくのドルビーシネマが台無し。AMCはこの状況を恥ずかしいと思わないのかしら? それとも客をバカにしてる?　ただし音響はすごくよいので星３。<//review></record></dataset><record>
