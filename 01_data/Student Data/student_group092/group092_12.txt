Very nice place to study, internet available, quick, and friendly librarians. But only one thing to many homeless hanging around even camping on the grass. There asking for money. Not save for children or for anyone. So many stores on the News. Need to improve  library's security.< /review>

I am very fond of this library. It possesses a fairly impressive catalogue both fiction and non-fiction. Nothing spectacular but impressive none the less given its location.</Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I enjoy this library; plenty of resources and nice librarians who are experts at finding what I need.

But it's sad to know the unpleasant  experience of a mother and children at our very own Public Library? !

Dear IRASEMA AVILA:
Your family should be able to enjoy a  positive and pleasant place in your own community..
Have you considered taking your library review to the Media?
They'll be glad to look into the truth of the matter and will likely result in positive changes for all.
GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY 😇<//Text>< date>

Friendly staff is always available for help. I'm going to take 1 star from this review because of the bums.

Bums are ruining the library experience. They are smelly, drunk, loud, creepy and just bad for the library overall. As an adult male I can look past all that. It's not good for children though.</text><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

I would not award them any stars.  I am very disappointed with this library.  They are not honoring their mission statement.  They are not providing free and equal access to resources or services.  I just relocated to Oxnard and I don't have access to a printer at home.  I went to the library to print out paperwork that I need to enroll my son in preschool. I took my 3 year old son in the stroller.  When I entered the computer lab I was informed that strollers were prohibited.  I was also informed that I would not be able to use the computer since their policy "printed in black and white" indicates that there is only "one person per computer" and my 3 year old son and I count as 2 people. By the way, this policy for the computer lab is not posted on their website.  It is posted by the computer lab.   I informed the attendant that my son would not be accessing the computer.  The attendant then informed me that I would have to use the computers outside the lab and that he could waive the two dollar fee.  Yes that would have been fine, but in the future when I go to the library with all of my children I will be restricted to use the computers outside of the lab and pay two dollars an hour.  This is a discriminatory practice against families.
This is incredibly disappointing.  My kids love spending time at the library.  I will not be a patron at this library or any of them in the county for that matter.  I will not allow my children to be patrons either.  I will not support an institution that has such discriminatory practices against families.

Mission statement--"The mission of the Oxnard Public Library is to enrich the lives of our diverse community by providing free and equal access to the resources, services, and programs that encourage life-long learning and lead to future success.

Offer open access to all library resources
Provide quality customer service
Lead the way to life-long learning"< /Text>

<Text>Horribel since we joined. Poor system. Too old school. Too strict with computer/internet use. They just want money from wherever they can get it. By charging for "damaged books" , loading money onto accounts only to be able to print. Homeless outside building. Making racists comments aloud. This library needs support and update.< /Text>< Pictures>

My favorite library in the local area. Friendly staff. Selection of books, periodicals, tapes, etc. seems to have gone down recently.  Still the free wi-fi, quiet, and comfortable settings makes this a nice place to read.

The Oxnard Public Library is a free public library system operated by the City of Oxnard, California. It has three locations: the Downtown Main Library, the South Oxnard Branch Library, and the Colonia Branch Library.

The main downtown library moved from the Carnegie building to a larger facility in 1963 and again in 1992. Through the mid-to-late 20th century the library also expanded its service throughout the city of Oxnard beyond the main building, first by offering bookmobile service (1956-1989) and then by opening additional branch locations. The South Oxnard Branch opened in 1989 and moved into a new facility in 2007. Colonia Branch, a small neighborhood branch adjacent to Del Sol Park, opened in 1978.<//Text>

This is a good library the only thing that I hate is that when we miss 1 day or 2 days to give back the books we have to pay that’s the horrible thing there and they don’t allow dogs and my dog has to stay outside with my mom my mom is outside there and telling me to hurry up it’s none really good but good job</text>

<Text>Puppy wasn't anxious when we picked her up which was great. It was unclear how long she was out playing and socializing versus on her own in her kennel - need to ask more questions about the dogs schedule for exercise vs rest time.
Puppy has been throwing up a couple times since she came back... Not sure if it's related to something she picked up at the facility. Really hoping it's not related and clears up in its own.<//Text><response>None</response>< Time>

This place is pretty pricey, but I feel so comfortable leaving my pet here. It's worth the money to know she is being cared for. She has stayed here twice and was remembered from the first visit. Staff is very friendly and the facility is clean. Much happier having her close to home rather than having to take her to Reno. Easy pick up and drop off.</text>

We dropped our 6 month old havanese here when we went to ski. He seemed like he had lots of fun as he was snoring on our way back. The drop off and pickup was quick and easy as I had made the reservation and uploaded his vaccination details online. The staff was friendly and responsive. They emailed me the estimated cost, check-in and check-out times. We also received the first day free as we were new customers. Would visit again.<//Review>

My puppy, ruthie, boots straight to them when we get there. So it makes me feel good about leaving her for the day. I check her after every pickup and there has not been an issue for me.

We've been here about 4 or 5 times now and have only done the Doggy daycare. Price has been straight forward for us everytime. I think it's the same amount to other doggy daycares in the area.

I have never gotten a card with ruthie's "report card" during any of my visits...I've seen people get them though so they do make a card haha which I was initially excited about because she hadn't ever been to a daycare before.

This will continue to be my winter daycare during the snowboarding season.< /text>

<date>1605332454575< /date><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Pros;  Very friendly staff. Clean facility. Didn't see play area (outdoor).
Cons: I suggest you ask right up front for the complete listing of charges and check out times.. We were told we wouldn't pay the daily fee, if we picked our dog up before noon. But, we were in fact charged about $18.00 for a morning playtime; since we didn't pick him up before 9 AM. This wasn't mentioned, or noted on their website.(At least not with the pricing and packages.)
Additionally, the 'first-time client special pricing' includes an additional fee, which was also never mentioned upfront.
These unexpected fees when we picked up our boy, just turned us off and left a bad impression about the place and business practices.</Review>< pictures>

Full of charges they tell you AFTER you go to pick up your pet.  Went to pick up my partner's dog after a one night stay, asked for an invoice and they said the computer wasn't responding. Noticed the payment requested was a little higher than my partner told me and not what I recall when bringing the dog in.  When I finally pressed and got the printout it clearly had charges that weren't requested.  I was there when we checked the dog in and nobody mentioned a "mandatory" pet care warrantee (nor did we sign off on one prior) and there was some type of "Olympian Packa" was added for another $25.  We were never informed, nor authorized this but at pick up was told it was "required"!!  Not in web site, nor at intake;  web site indicates that there are choices of "play packages" that CAN be chosen, not that "must" be chosen.  Now price of a pet board is near a one night stay at a hotel for a person when the only viewable price is not what it really is.  They keep some ratty copy of charges BEHIND the counter.  Bait and Switch!!  I asked what the charge was, and was told it was a "play package", so even though the dog is assured 3 "potty" breaks, presumably expected in an overnight ans standard at another nearby dog boarding facility, you are paying extra for that without notification.  Seems like workers will say (or not say) anything to make money and keep their jobs.< /review>

4 - 5 years ago, I gave you the 5 stars rate because they did good care of my baby dog during we vacation and camp. My baby dog was happy and been fun with other dogs. My baby dog feels comfortable her room. They are so cute like a small hotel. 😍< /review>

We could not be happier with our experience at Truckee-Tahoe pet lodge. Our dog is always so excited as we turn on to West River Street and he is always greeted with smiles and lots of love! In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to work and could spend every second with our pup but this is definitely the best alternative we could ever think of! The holiday and birthday parties are the best and the photos we are given as a keepsake are some of our most favorite photos of our four-legged friend! They are so accommodating and helpful! I recommend this place constantly to friends!< /Text>

Great place to leave your fur babies when you want to ride the mountain with peace of mind. They have indoor and outdoor areas and feed food you bring. My Shiba had so much fun here. I'm not sure who is more exhausted at the end of the day :)< /review>

<review>Boarded my elderly chihuahua there for 10 days while visiting family who do not allow pets.  The staff were all wonderful and gave Maisy lots if attention.  They did not mind us popping in at all different times of the day to visit for a few minutes or take her out for an hour or two.< /review>< userid>

Great doggy day care. My dog is a bit of an anti social but when i returned to pick him up in the afternoon, there he was on the video monitor, a social butterfly and interacting with all of the other dogs. Amazing!</Review>

The staff is always super friendly, we love seeing photos of the pups during playtime, the facility is clean, and the fun themed parties are an added perk.

Cassidy, Garnett, Colleen and the whole team there have treated me with the best service I could imagine over this past year. They go out of their way to create a one of a kind experience with your dogs and cats. The facility is very clean and customized to the level of comfort that you want your fur baby to have. They even hold fun events for holidays and your pets birthday where they take themed photos. Im currently looking at his picture from st. patty's day and Christmas on my desk lol. I could literally go on for days. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone looking for doggy day care or overnight lodging to please choose the pet lodge. I will be taking my pup here for the rest of his life. Thanks Guys!<//Review><date>1557951823086< /date></record>

This facility is great and the staff is super nice/helpful. They were more than happy to give me a tour when I dropped by. They post pictures of the dogs playing everyday on Facebook, so you can see your little guy playing. I wouldn't say they are priced higher than others, but boarding a pet gets really expensive!<//Review>

We only had the new phones we purchased for 7 days. My husband's phone was not functioning anymore. This happened while he was at work today. He went to the store after work to see if he could get a new one or transfer the service to his iphone that he owns. We do have insurance as well for the phones. The manager at this store named Anai, told him that she couldnt help him at all. I went with him to another store, and the associate there told him that all she needed to do was an insurance claim. She also said that the manager from the other store should've been able to transfer the service to his iphone. We went back to the store and she ended up doing an insurance claim on the phone. She said that a new phone should be arriving tomorrow. We went back to the other store and the associate there helped my husband apply his phone line to his iphone in less than 5 min. Why couldnt the manager at the other store do that? I would not recommend this store to anyone. The manager and the other associates at this store are very unprofessional and lazy. Customer service is horrible. I never knew how easy it is to work at Boost Mobile and be on my personal phone while on the clock.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

best boost mobile store around this area, service was great!! I was looking to buy an affordable phone for my kids, and the staff was really professional, unlike other boost mobile stores this one has more then one person behind the counter. I will definitely make my payments here.<//Review>

My ordered beauty products have good quality. I enjoyed using it every day. It was suited to my skin color. I loved my choice of having a nice lipstick and a cream foundation. The important thing is that we should be careful in choosing the right product for our skin, especially to our face since it is the most sensitive part. Thank you guys for your beautiful product!<//review>

I was looking for a place to get a haircut today on my way home from the office and I stopped at Lena's when I noticed the barber sign.  They are set up outside of their shop.  She was really nice and cared how I wanted my haircut.  The price for a haircut is very reasonable.  I highly recommend this shop.  Please note they are a cash only business.  Be well, Michael :-)< /Review>

I've been coming here twice a month since I moved to San Diego 6 years ago.  Henry is a great guy with a big heart and an even better set of clippers.  He does fantastic fades and will be sure to keep you looking good in regulation hair.  Highly recommended.<//text>

I've always had a great service here! The owner and his wife are very pleasant, courteous and professional. I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. Also, if you love sports, their 60 in + flat screen TV is playing the latest as you get your haircut. 🇺🇸</text>

Henry and his friendly barbers will give a nice clean traditional men's haircut for $10.  Popular with local sailors and marines. No waiting and convenient during off peak hours.< /Review>

My name is George I went to go look for used tires. They found 2 tires my size with good tread. Empire gave me a price for the tires that couldn't be beat, but I only had so much money and they accommodated my financal issue and gave me great customer service with a smile and got me back on the road with in 15 minutes. I recommend this fine establishment to everyone. Thanks empire tire. Thanks to the owner Fred and his crew.<//Text>

I went here to get me a tire. Not only do they have good used tire's for the low,great workers and good customer service. But before I could have a chance to enjoy the cold air in the lobby, it was time to pay and go. I would defiantly good back and recommended that if you in the area and need a tire hit them up.</Text>

PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF I could give them negative stars I would. They are a bunch of thieves. I gave them thousands of dollars for parts they were going to order. Long story short they never ordered my parts and didn't give my money back. I would call to get an update on weather my parts were ready and they would always say "they will be here soon"  which is all they would say for  6 months. It was then that I knew they were all Liars and had not actually ordered any parts. They even told me "we are not getting yours parts of giving your money back". They will take your money and keep it. It has happened to others at this same spot but I did not know prior to going to this place. If you have had a similar experience with them write it on here and let me know. A Sheriff has a recording of all this. Alfred and Steve agreed on all of this when I brought a sheriff in. Do not trust these guys they are a bunch of cowards.</text>

Check your tires Fred , sold me one that was cracked on the side wall and told me to come back when he opened it completely which was in may.  Took it back his brother said come back when we sort out tires we just got a shipment, called back like a week later cuz I was busy working  then Fred says "well u bought them two months ago." hummm you just opened your shop in may     But whatever that's a good way to get customers.   Good luck on your new rip off tire shop<//text>

I’ve never gone to a tire shop that doesn’t balance your tires, as matter of fact they have no machine to balance your tires! They will send you down the street but only after you notice that they did not balance your tires to begin with!<//review>

< Review>
Been waiting on my tires for over 2 weeks. Gave a $100 deposit and still haven’t got a call to have my tires put on. Got a flat tire today and had to be towed to Romona Tires. Now Im here with my client waiting on them to put my new tires on. I really didn’t think I would have to have a experience like this with this company.😒<//Review>

We installed a used tire because the new ones were about an hour out and you needed to leave. So we went above and beyond and installed a used tire at no cost to you.  In two weeks you never called or came by. When your tire blew you had it towed to ramona tire when we are a few blocks away.  We still have your tires and I am sure at $260 for a set of 215/60r16 tires, you will not find a better deal for an equivalent tire. Please contact me at 951-230-3528 whenever you are ready to install your tires.'}</response>< Gmap_id>

It's a gas station that you should go to in the AM. Later in the afternoon to evening you get the unsavory customers who either just woke up or have nothing better to do than hang out at a gas station jamming their music. Employees are good unfortunately they have knuckleheads to deal with<//review>

Mediocre and in a tight spot if you want to make it to Philly BBQ up the road or anywhere else in that direction from the construction going on surrounding the new additions to Metros stop and its location right on the same block.

Asides from that the gas did the trick and ended up powering the car that we fed it to for long enough to get to the point I had to repeat the exact same thing I did here at the Vallero down the road....

... away from the construction.<//Review>

None of their card readers work and they charge to use a card as a payment which is not allowed by shells contract with the credit card companies. Graffiti all over the gas pumps.</review>

<Text>DON'T USE THIS GAS STATION!!!!!!

WHEN SWIPING A CARD, YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET A $95 HOLD PLACED ON YOUR ACCOUNT.

I HAD A HOLD PLACED AND WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO GET GAS.

THEY HOLD YOUR MONEY FOR 7 DAYS!!!!

RUNNING A SCAM TO UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE.

DON'T GO HERE!!!</Text>< Pictures>

<date>1506542419709< /date><rate>1</rate><review>I used my debit card at 3:25 am at the gas pump. 12 dollas and 45 cents is four gallons of shell 87 octane, which is 120 miles in my car (30 mpg). I have alerts on my debit card whenever i use my card. I get an alert that says i purchased 77 dollars at shell gas even though my receipt said i spent 12.45$. Very sketchy gas station pay in cash only or get a alert from your credit or debit card letting you know you have paid more than what you paid for?< /review>< pictures>

They scan your club card but won't give you your Ralphs discount and blame it on Ralphs. Don't go unless you got a gun anyway< /Review>

Nothing can be more dangerous than keeping wicked companions. They communicate the infection of their vices to all who associate with them.

<text>(Translated by Google) Very beautiful, comfortable and elegant.
In addition to having modern architecture, the environment brings a lot of inner peace.
Church well lit and easily accessible, I would marry here for sure😍
First time I come and I already liked it a lot, I want to be able to return here one day.

Muito linda, confortável e elegante.
Além de ter uma arquitetura moderna, o ambiente trás muita paz interior.
Igreja bem iluminada e de fácil acesso, casaria aqui com certeza😍
Primeira vez que venho e já gostei muito, quero poder voltar um dia aqui.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

There has never been more than two tellers working when I've been there (in over nine years); often it's just one, usually slow, and with an exceptionally long line. Forget coming on a Saturday unless you want to spend half a day there.

They always have an excuse: "everyone's out to lunch." "Someone's out sick." "It's not usually like this." Well, it's always like that.

Terrible branch, terrible service, shameful.<//text><user_name>Mark B</user_name>< user>

Because of nearest branch as the base of my home address I never feel right and good hospitality from this bofa branc, rude and unprofessional staff. Always need to go other branch to get help. I don’t understand why this branch is like that. I am not kinda to make complain to anywhere but I feel so bad experience from this place. I am expecting good service from this place<//review>

This banking center will make you feel as little as possible in every opportunity they get.
The teller line is always LONG, if for whatever reason your business can’t be handled by the ATM you will have to see the teller. And even then the teller will let you have a piece of their mind why you should use an ATM.
If you want to see a Personal Banker for whatever reason they will tell you to make an appointment. Problem with that is their online system will give you an appointment time 5 days from now. I don’t wanna come back 5 days from now.
In other words this center will find a way to tell you not to come to their center. Then why on earth do you have this center. Last ever time at this center.</text>

Long lines with only 1 teller, Lana or Lane. She doesn't even know how to do her job. Management need to properly train their employee before opening up a branch. SUCKS to be stuck for more than 1 hour just to transfer money.<//Review>

I have been in line for the last 19 minutes,  and it's usually a 35 minute wait to see a teller.   So if you plan on coming at your lunch break, bring your lunch with you.  They usually only have one or two tellers and a line of 20 people. I hate this bank, I am going to close my account. Bank with usbank or wells Farg , they are better.< /review>

I get there under staffed.  But talk about no innitiative to work dilligently.  They all take their sweet ass time even though the line is 20 deep.  Basically they act is if they dont care that people look flustered waiting 45 minutes in line.  They laugh and giggle and overall show very poor customer service.  Avoid this b of a at all costs.</review>

I have never come in and seen a line of fewer than 20 people. It's egregiously understaffed and the line can be so long it reaches the front doors. I've never seen a BofA with so much obvious disregard of and contempt for its clients' (who are mostly lower income and/or minority) needs. I don't bank here personally and if I could cancel the business account which necessitates my visits, I would. The few tellers they have are friendly and helpful, and I have seen them take plenty of abuse for management's understaffing policy. No surprise that teller turnover appears high.< /Review>

<Text>This has to be the worst banking experience I have ever had, REPETITIVELY. It never fails, usually on a Friday I wait anywhere from 30 mins to a hour just to cash my check and withdrawal. Youd think id get it done faster at the ATM, but they are always out of service or have an even longer line. This busy loction only staffs 2 tellers on a FRIDAY! Don't worry though, the manager will make sure you know someone is being trained or tell you to use a ATM, which by the way, today, is OUT of cash.  Every day of the week, including Fridays and Mondays they only have 2 tellers!!!!. I am now here on Monday , the atms are out of cash, there are 13 ppl in front of me and only 2 tellers. The only good thing about this place is the security guard. I HAVE NEVER LEFT A REVIEW ON A BUSINESS PAGE BUT I AM SO FED UP WITH THE UNPROFESSIONALISM AND CARELESS ATTITUDE OF THE MANAGER .... FIRE HER AND HIRE PPL TO GET THE JOB DONE.</Text><Time>1506379393156</Time>< Gmap_id>

< review>
First off most BofA's need more ATM's! There's a good amount of times I gone to a few of them and there's a line outside for their 2 ATM machines and if theirs lines outside then it usually means that the inside is worse. If you go inside there's like 2 or 3 tellers which makes it the same as the outside! Now about this location; the customer service is okay. One time I came inside and the teller told me I qualified for some credit card. I told her I was running late but how long would it take and she replied that the banker was with one person and would be with me right after. I waited for 15 minutes and asked when I was getting helped and she apologized and said shortly. I waited about 5 more minutes and a woman walked up to me and said she could set up an appointment because they had someone else ahead of me!!!??!?
I was soooo mad I told her no and walked out and I don't ever plan to get any other cards besides my checkings account. This is the closest BofA to me but I rather go to the one in El Cerrito or El Sobrante. I have been with BofA off and on but lately it's been a little too much. As far as security and why I gave a 3 star was to their security. I had someone try and use my debit and BofA did not allow the transaction. They called and left a message , text, and emailed me right away. As far as the Richmond location they get a 2 star because they are friendly when you get to your turn but feels like they are very disorganized.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad service 😡 the person who receives it at the entrance of the door is an arrogant person who does not know how to give a good service, they should hire personnel who provide good service or close since they are incompetent in the respect of good customer service

My kids meet their school pals after school here on wednesdays. It is a really nice park with public tennis courts and walk ways for excersize... However no restroom makes it a bummer... Got to leave sooner due to bathroom needs.</Text>

Be careful with toddler swings.  The leg holes are very small.  My son shifted forward and get stuck in one.  We actually had to call the fire dept to help remove him.  Cell service is also lancing in the area.  Other then that the park is fantastic for all ages.< /Review>

There is a small play structure for the smaller kids, and some batting cages. Only ranked 84 stars because there is a better park very close. However, is a good park if you live in the area.< /Text>< Pics>

They always treat us great and never try to push any repairs that are not needed. I actually have gone in a few times to have something checked out...expecting to pay out the wazoo, but they assured it was not critical and could wait for a later date to put together with oil or brake change to save on labor.< /text>

Honest, fast hard workers. No BS or hassle. Cheap labor. They are awesome. The girl at the counter. Knows her stuff.  I told her what my car was doing and she told me what it most likely was and she was right. I left with a smile and money in my pocket still.</Text>

I was told that I need a new transmission. A $3500 solution not counting labor. I took my car to another mechanic who told me it was a sensor issue that cost me $350.00 to get fixed and my car is running fine. I don't trust them and would not recommend them.<//review>

<Time>1558894988205<//Time><rate>5<//rate><review>These guys are GREAT! My husband has worked in auto repair industry his ENTIRE life so he knows sales tactics and B.S so when we moved here we needed a new mechanic.

Emerald was very honest, no pressure at all, gave us a full evaluation and estimate and allowed us to decide what service we wanted without the normal "guilt trip" that some other places will give if you decline a service.

We have since brought ALL 4 vehicles in our family as well as our nephews truck.

He was here on a 72 hour from the army in Arizona, when he truck broke and we told emerald that he needed to be back for morning formation they got him fixed up and out the door in time to make the drive back.

Knowledgeable, efficient, and also offer a military discount. Great shop<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dc715764b8dee3:0x7972529af98a6d68< /GmapID></record>

<Response>None</Response><text>Many, many thanks to Kevin who went out of his way to have our Ford Transit van ignition key programed.  Being a 2018 van the shop had not programed one yet. It took Kevin several shops and 4 or more hours to find someone who could reprogram the key.  To our surprise we were treated to a second programed key at no charge.  Tenacity, patience and customer satisfaction is what you will find at the Emerald Auto Service Center.  Highest of marks go to the service desk and especially to Kevin for not giving up on us.</text></record></dataset><record>

The people at Emerald Auto Service are honest, hard-working folk. It is like fresh air to find a good mechanic who treats you fairly and with complete honesty. My roadside assistance service directed me to Emerald and it was a lucky break for me and my family. Kevin and Hector are friendly, helpful and good at their work. In summary,  *** GO TO EMERALD  FOR AUTO WORK ***<//text>

<Review>I called for a quote on getting a timing belt replacement service for my 1995 Honda Civic DX car since I am currently a customer of S & R Service Center. The owner and mechanic, (Nico Bosi) quoted me the price of $750.00 to do the full installation of the timing belt replacement kit.

I wanted to compare what the quote would be at Emerald Auto Service Center. I spoke to Hector this service writer he quoted me the price of $635.00 for the timing belt replacement.  Emerald Auto Service Centers' quote is much lower because it is just the timing belt replacement not the complete installation of the timing belt replacement kit with the factory brand parts which is a reasonable quote of $750.00. The timing belt replacement is supposed to be done at the 70,000 or 90,000 mile service.

Hector told me since my car is 24 years old even though my car has low mileage (41,000), I need to bring my car into his automotive repair shop as soon as possible because it is a wear and tear issue. It could be a wear and tear issue, I appreciate that Hector made me more aware of a potential problem. I won't know for sure until I get a diagnostic check at another automotive repair shop in the future.< /Review>< Response>

The owner treats his employees with respect and great care, so you will always have the same technician, and managers to help you and only make the necessary repairs. No up sales, or was I ever put in a uncomfortable situation to purchase something. Only the repairs that was necessary. Everybody always takes great care of you here.

<Review>Went for an oil change and come out with a fender bender. The mechanic himself got my car hit AT the parking lot as he was backing up, to me that's being careless.  It was minor but the pain of scheduling things and get my car fix was a major headache. It was UNPROFESSIONAL. It was supposed to be an hour of boring sitting down and a lot of waiting, but instead it turns out to be a 3 days asking the boss if i can get off work early to take my car to a body shop. Let's be honest, it was an accident but careless nonetheless. This should be 1, but i'll give it a 2 for nice customer service. I recommended this shop to one of my friends, now I'm going to have to contact him to not go here anymore cause I don't want his car get wrecked too and hate me for it. One last thing, this was my 1st car maintenance since i bought my car, so thank you for a wonderful experience. (SARCASM)</Review>< Response>

< Review>
I took my car in for noise that it was making and they try to sell me a new alternator and told me that I had to replace all three pulleys on my vehicle when it's a 2011 Jeep Patriot afterwards I took it to a very good mechanic friend of mine that had his own shop he told me they're kind of overpriced me and they're trying to sell me things that I didn't need now the alternator than I do have to last me for another two years or year-and-a-half but it wasn't necessary thing to replace at the moment they were trying to charge me $900 to do a job that wasn't even needed at the moment and I still got charged $110 for an inspection fee also I was told that they took off the shocks the struts and some other stuff that wasn't necessary to take off and that they were going to charge me $575 just for that please save your money and go to somebody else that you could actually trust and that's honest enough to tell you what's really wrong with your vehicle.< /Review>

A good friend of mine told me about Emerald Auto ,
Since he is a good friend I took his word, and took my vehicle to Emerald Auto for some repairs and service... I had a coolant leak and i wanted it looked at Immediately.
When I arrived  i was greeted by Shannon. She was very friendly and at the same time very helpful.
I only waited a short time before they figured out what the problem was.
I was given a complete estimate before the work was done , and they showed me where is the coolant leaking from.
I will recommend Emerald Auto to all of my friends and relatives. They are very honest and concerned about treating their customers right<//Text>

I went to Emerald Auto Service for the Transmission Fluid flush and power steering fluid. After 3 hours of waiting, they said all is complete, I paid over 300 dollars and left.  Next oil change I was told that the transmission fluid is very bad and has to be changed (at a different location), I decided to take my car to Honda and ask them about transmission fluid and they said the same thing.  Obviously they never changed the transmission fluid, they just charged me for it.  Despite the admin being very nice, the service is horrible and I do not recommend anyone going to them, unless you check every step of their work.  You can not trust them.<//Text>

<Review>I needed a battery and I found them on the AAA site as an approved service center.  I made an appt. got there a little early they didn't make me wait until my scheduled appt. time they took me in. Kevin and the employees  have great customer service.  Kevin recommended the battery that best suited my situation. Needless to say I was in and out in a timely manner and on the road.  I would use their service again.<//Review>< pics>

How this place keeps getting rid of all the bad reviews they have been racking up over the coarse of time (listed on different web pages IE:Google/ Yahoo) amazes me. See for yourself. Still some on there. The good ones? Most likely friends of the owner? parents of kids on the baseball team this shop sponsors and buys uniforms for? Most likely with their logo on the jersey. Why not? Free Advertisement,  phony image , and what the hey the money isn't coming out of his pockets. I'm sure I'm not the only one of his customers that paid for a few seasons worth of uniforms with the overcharged bill they racked up on me. New fictional air conditioner parts, Freon, and a cornucopia of fantasy repair hours. I would have had better luck and results taking my car to Disneyland and asking them to repair it! The only positive note about this place, As another reviewer noted on Google,is they have friendly shuttle service.Maybe they should go into a cab service. But as far as auto repair goes I was absolutely hosed on an air conditioner job then juiced again when i took it back. Rather then them honor the warranty. They should keep their warranties wrapped up around the toilet tissue holders in the restrooms at least then they would be usable and worth something then! They claimed it was a different problem and charged me again but hit me up for the same part  twice (the same exact temperature sensor) listed on both invoices caught by the mechanic at a different repair shop I had to take the car to finally get it fixed! He also informed me and noted it was impossible to have charged my A/C with as much freon as they listed. The compressor wasn't capable of holding that much.  Got a grudge against your money go ahead and use these people. Like to reference Vermin instead but posting policy prohibits. You too can have an air conditioner that doesn't work after paying them to the tune of $1,444.13. Rather then apologies and making things right  the owner tried to stick it to me for shocks as I definitely didn't need. (after his so called free customer complimentary inspection)  How do I know I didn't need them? I just had new ones installed all the way around  week prior. If you do decide to use this place make darn sure you don't smile if you have any gold fillings and take a good size jar of Vaseline with you.. NO HONESTY, NO INTEGRITY, NO CONSCIENCE!! They ought to be in jail instead of  running an auto repair shop.IT'S YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS and your decision to do whatever you desire. However, JUST DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED about this place!<//Review>

< review>
We had an air conditioning system replaced on an older Buick about 10 months ago using a NAPA compressor.  When the compressor failed in Austin Texas last month NAPA said they would replace the compressor but not pay for the nearly thousand dollars in labor costs.  It seemed to me and to Mike at Golden Wrench that the labor was not the issue but the compressor was but NAPA would not warranty the labor even though the installation was not the problem.  Mike at Golden Wrench really stepped up and took care of the labor even though it was not technically his problem' the problem was with NAPA. The problem took several weeks to solve but after a lot of persistence by both Mike and myself the garage in Texas replaced the failed compressor and Golden Wrench picked up the labor charge.  I really respect the way Mike and Golden Wrench stepped up and handled the problem rather than hiding behind technicalities the way NAPA did.  Golden Wrench was great but NAPA has sadly gone the way of most huge corporate entities that farm out their work to cheap Chinese companies who couldn't care less about quality.  Avoid NAPA at all costs but don't lump Golden Wrench into that category.  Excellent Garage!<//review>

Have gone here twice on my sister's reccomendation. I bought a but of a lemon but they were able to sort it out for me and even went to a junkyard to find the parts I was gonna need without changing me labor for finding it. Very good work and I will be back if anything goes awry.< /Text>

All I ordered was 2 frozen cokes and 2 large fries. When I got to the pickup window and discovered they were giving me 2 regular cokes by mistake I offered to pay the difference. The manager was called over and said he would take care of it and asked me to pull around front. So I did. 20 minutes went by and a worker came outside and apologized but they were out of coke freeze supplies. I asked for my regular cokes and left.

I'd go on, but I think we can all see the frustrations.<//text>

Bad service. Order two big breakfast to go when the order window delivered  I check the bag top one was perfect but when got home and opened bottom one was incomplete only pancake hashbrown was missing too. If McDonald's needs to make  extra money stealing from it's customers not a great idea.< /text>

<review>I've never waited 30 mins in the drive thru. I'm not sure how this is even possible. Then they forgot one if the meals and immediately walked away and  never came back to the window. The lobby is closed so I had to walk back to the window. Absolutely terrible.<//review>< gmapID>

Took my kids to go get some drinks so I can get a coffee. We were literally the only car there. It took them 15 minutes to give us a large soda and medium iced coffee. And not only that as I tried to get the attention of the employees, that were all walking around without masks, they seen me looked and went on talking with the others. Then when the shift manager finally came he told me that I couldn't even get the hot mocha I orders because the machine was down. Can't believe I waiting in like to be ignored for over 15 minutes</Text>

Slowest drive thru McDonald’s ever. Waited in line for 30 min without it moving, so I pulled back and left. They really need to speed up or hire more workers< /Review>

<name>Cat Montelongo<//name><Review>It never seems to fail... They know when they mess up on ordered because they don't give you a receipt.
Long story short: I ordered 2 doubles with extra ketchup and pickles. They gave me extra onions.
I call and tell them they messed up and I don't have a receipt to do their survey.
The employee responds with "oh I'm sorry, we don't have enough pickles."
It's ok to say you guys don't, just let a customer know.<//Review><rate>2</rate>< gmapID>

Horrible service,  should replace management. Worst service i had ever had. Bunch of dummies work there. The current management just sits there and eats pies,drinks milkshakes and mcflurrys all day. That's why they are always out. I mean really look at them.</Text>

Worst service ever! I work for UBER EATS and my app instructions were to pick up in store as to enter through the main entrance but the main entrance was totally CLOSED as they made me go thru the drive-thru making me wait 20 mins for an order placed on the customer's phone. See attached two photos one is the app pick up instructions and the other is the actual restaurant's sign outside their door saying it was CLOSED!</Text>

I waited at curbside for 25 minutes. Cars in the drive thru were moving alot faster. The meat patties were overly salty. Got a notice about 10 min in saying visit us next time, like they cleared my order and I waited another 15 minutes.< /Text>

Came to get some much needed refreshments, although they charge here for a large cup of ice water, in L.A. area McDonald's they do not. What a bummer. McDonald's here in Bakersfield should be ashamed. Even Starbucks gives you free Venti ice water. 2 stars!< /text>

<rate>2< /rate><text>I ordered single meals with no soda, a mocha frap. Two fries & a happy meal this early afternoon.  I actually wanted three fries I told the girl I wanted a quarter pounder #2 with just the fries. She said they don’t do that. Okay I understand but I told her give me the quarter pounder & fries. The girl on the speaker gasped rudely. I didn’t end up getting the three fries. But I did get the two sausage w. egg McMuffins. Be professional. And we can hear you!
Btw, The two egg sausage McMuffins were for my mother-in-law & brother-in-law. She recently lost her husband & my brother-in-law is sick. They had to share their fries. He has special needs.
I apologized to the cashier for ordering single meals & told him the girl who took my order sounded bothered for the way I ordered but he didn’t mind to care he just checked if my order was correct & had me pay which is totally understandable that’s his job that is all he had to do. But it disappointed me. My daughters birthday was yesterday. I hadn’t bought her a happy meal in a long time. I wasn’t asked what gender & she was sad she didn’t get a girl toy. 😕<//text>< Pics>

It's always either a really good experience or a not so great one. Never just one or the other. It's a convenient distance from my house but I've honestly only ever had problems with this location in particular.</Review>

I order two kids meals and they give me juice boxes, I ordered orange soda,  I told her at the window before grabbing the drinks, she sighs and says okay. First a little rude, then she hands me two kid sodas COVERED in soda, how hard is it to fill a soda without over filling?

Everything outside was clean, service was good. I couldn't really hear the girl on the drive thru and she ended up ordering a fanta orange for me but I'm sure it was just misunderstanding. I tried a big mac for the first time ever. I was very unimpressed. It was tinier than  expected and the sauce was gross but I didnt factor that into this rating. And I didnt get ketchup with my fries after asking for it. Overall this mcdonalds was much more appealing than others I've been to< /review>

Worst McDonald's in Bakersfield. The lobby is still closed, meaning everyone must use drive-thru = long waits. The drive-thru is double lane, but one of the speakers is usually broken = longer waits. Orders for Uber pickup are never ready on time. Overall, this McDonald's just wastes everyone's time.<//text>

Horrible assistant manager. She spoke to me so rude when I told her my door dash order was wrong. She blamed door dash. How can it be them, they can’t open our bags and check. I’m out 2 cheeseburgers and 2 double cheeseburgers. Then she challenged me to come down there then hung up the phone on me. What a LOSER....<//review>

When you going to this location, I went to the drive-through and sat behind a lady ordering for more than 5 minutes, and she showed no plans of moving. So, I backed up and went inside to get my order that I wanted. Upon going inside, all of the employees were Very young, except for the manager. When I walked in, nobody acknowledged my presence. The workers were behind the counter talking in a sort of half circle sort of stance. There was a person at the takeout window still taking the order of the lady I was behind in line outside. I counted to 10 out loud and nobody acknowledged me or looked up at the counter, so I said, “Well, this was a learning experience. I got poor service outside, came inside and there’s not one person at the counter to take my order, and nobody acknowledged me coming in. I’ll go elsewhere thank you.” I turned around to leave, and the manager said with urgency, “No, I’ll take your order.“ I replied, “No, I’m good thank you I’ll go elsewhere,” while waving my hand and left.<//Text>

Awful......clueless worker at the drive thru.  Waited 5 minutes to place order and 10+ to pay.  I  do not understand why they have the most inept person taking orders and money.  Had to correct order 3 times.</text>

<text>Drive thru can be quick most of the time. I find that the staff are talking and socializing at work more than working. The outside looks clean, but homeless do tend to congregate here because of the bus stop right out front. One time, i found a large piece of bone in s chicken nugget (which I will never eat again). When I returned to get a replacement meal because the nuggets were no longer desirable, the manager told me it was an onion and “what do you want?”. Clearly, I am more than able to tell the difference between a hard piece of bone between my teeth and a soft piece of dehydrated onion. My first job was working at McDonald’s and i was appalled at the way the manager was speaking to me.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Very hungry in the distance a big building near the intersection where the cars drive past you the car lights hitting the ground my stomache was growling.I approached a crosswalk and this is a story of what happens next as soon as I come face to face with a young lady standing behind a wall next to a kitchen behind a cash register machine she takes my order touching the pos she then hands me my receipt.This is a complaint I'd like to publicly discuss about. At 0500 hours I walked into a McDonald's. I received horrible service.  After the cashier takes my order I waited 45 minutes for 2 burgers and they messed onther people food in front of me.  The customers looked mad while waiting to show there receipt to the worker who can't even make a food right. They used to have good people but they all got replaced. The cashier who took my order wasn't even wearing the right uniform she looked so lost she messed up ppl food.  This was first time I actually had to wait so much usually I'm in then out in less than 10 which is ok but 45 minutes you lost a customer.</Review>< Pics>

Chicken nuggets were fresh and delicious. Box brought to me popped open and then to go order of nuggets box was open too. Service was monotone and slow on all to go orders. Drive thru backed up waiting on orders. Disgruntled in drive thru,  threw bbq sauce into window at cashier then came inside complaining wrong sauce was given and drive thru service (cashier) was horrible.<//review>

This place always gets our order wrong!! No matter what time or day it is every single time we have gone they always seem to screw it up we have to drive back many times because there is something missing. One time we went near closing time and headed home than realized we were missing food when we went back they couldn't even fix it or give us what we ordered because they said everything was closed already!! Also the wait is always 20 to 30 min for FAST food.<//review>

I would recommend every one to not eat this food it been shown to be very unhealthy and lead to unpleasant life instead i would recommend subway or even pollo loco better healthier choice. Try and stay away from animal products youll feel alot better more energy and longer life. God bless ⭐🌈🙏</text>

Placed our order, then a lady pulled in front of lady in front of her and me and wouldnt let us in. So I know it messed up the order of the food that came out. We didnt get our drinks and most of our food was cold.  Had to park and go in to get drinks and still hot them wrong.<//Text>

Not anymore they have fixed whatever the problem was.   drive-thru is very quick and very accurate.  I'm happy to say they fix the problem?!  thank you McDonald's on Niles!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I feel like every time I come to this McDonald's I'm always waiting. Waiting to order, waiting to pay, and waiting to get my food. Sometimes the total amount of waiting can be up to 30 minutes. It's never any different. I dont come here a lot but you would think that at least once I wouldn't be waiting but no....always waiting.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Review>The drive thru is ALWAYS SO SLOW!  It always takes 20min to order & get food.  Defeats the purpose of "fast food" this particular trip after waiting 23 min I asked if there was bbq sauce in the bag.  The guy at the window asked & reassured me there was.  I looked and saw containers only to get home & have sweet &sour sauce & spicy buffalo sauce.  Neither which my children will eat 😠 I tried calling but no one answers.</Review><resp>None</resp>< name>

Absolutely horrible.  Pulled into the drive thru at 11:05. It was 11:35 when we got our food. 30 minutes is ridiculous.  Then when we got it home, we were shorted a burger. Will not be going to this store again!!!</text>

<review>When this McDonald’s first opened everything was great, but now every time I visit this place my order is wrong. Employees seem unhappy and are not friendly, the drive thru line is always ridiculous.

Update

So I gave this place another try AND no one was there....literally! I was at the drive thru for almost 10 min couldn't back out or drive forward because there was cars in back and another in front of me, so I had to yell "HELLO...I'M READY TO ORDER!" Don't bother with this place<//review><user>106697163010599706965<//user>< Pics>

<review>Food is the McDonald's usual which is no problem, but when lunch break is 30 minutes, i wait 10 literal minutes in the drivethru, and a 3 min drive to and from work.....that left less than half my break to eat. Its been this way for almost a year now.< /review>< resp>

<review>Had to wait 10 minutes for a burger and chicken tenders. They brought our food out to the car (when they ask you to pull into the drive thru parking, it's never good) without so much as a "sorry for the wait".</review>< Response>

So every Saturday morning I get my kids breakfast at this McDonalds drive thru. 3 Saturdays in a row my order was handed to me with missing food.🤬 and I had to walk back in the restaurant to tell them.. I try to keep my cool but today I had to let them know. With this said I want to say within the last year my order had missing iteams about 8-10 times.. so drive thru goers beware< /text>

< Review>
I've gone thru this drive thru a few times hoping I'd have a better experience. This location USED
TO  be fast with good service. Today I was stuck in the drive thru for at least 20 min. I was cut off while placing my order and was told she'll be right back. I was there before the other 3 cars who showed up in the 2nd drive thru row. They were being helped and ended up in front of me while I was still waiting for the girl to come back to complete my order. The employees seemed really stressed and frustrated. I was frustrated but also felt bad for them. This location needs new and better management! The way this location is being operated is not fair to the customers or employees! GET IT TOGETHER!</Review>

<Text>Horrible service since " new owners" took over. It's 100 degrees today and the ice cream machine is not working. The manager there said they clean the machine every two weeks and she is busy with drive through today and cannot clean it. She said no one else is trained to clean it either.</Text></record>

There were a few people waiting at an empty cash register. All the employees were busy...no biggie, until the girl walked up to the register after handing a guy his sundaes and tells all of us very rudely.
"You know you can order at the kiosks, but whatever." She then proceeds to ask the people at the register "What do you want?" No joke! I looked at my kid and said "Well we will be getting TacoBell" and walked out. Ridiculously horrible customer service!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

Used self service ordering machine. It took my money, but no order processed. Management said she can't do anything, to call my bank to dispute the charges. Will never go back !!!!!!!! Wish I could give negative stars !<//Review>

<Date>1500405466057</Date><Text>This place takes way too damn long. I pulled out of line after waiting 15 minutes and DIDNT EVEN MOVE! Once we moved and i was able to get out of line i sure as hell did. Ridiculous. If someone has a huge order that holds up your line you need to ask them to PULL FORWARD! I live right next to it and i have to go to the one on white lane because this one is always packed full of cars and not moving. No iced tea is worth waiting in that! I never complain about places but after experiencing over and over every single time i go there i had to write a review.< /Text>< Pictures>

We visit this Mcdonalds every other week and I can say 90% of the time they get something wrong. Or forget something it's close and convinent so that's why we go back. But I'm so tired of having to go back to fix order or receive missing item.</Review>
