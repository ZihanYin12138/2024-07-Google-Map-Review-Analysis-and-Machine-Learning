I don’t know why this place doesn’t have 5 stars. Everything is really good. Staff is knowledgeable and super friendly. If you have a problem with this place it’s more then likely you are the problem.</text>

< Review>
Too sweet for my liking. The cupcakes almost seemed store bought as they looked super moist under the dirty glass presentation they had them under. Also my 5 dollar latte was half foam ! And it didn't taste anything special. Service was also bad the girl seemed irritated by us. Perhaps because they were going to close within the next 20 minutes of us stopping in.

All in all would rather spend my 10 dollar purchase of these items at a local Starbucks and cupcakes from Sprinkles</Review>

<review>I asked for a cold drink and they gave me a hot one. I would appreciate it if they would ask me how I like my drink.  My girlfriend ordered the smallest size tea and it was half ice. The food was delicious, definitely try the fire braised chicken. Not a fun experienxe overall but at least I got my caffeine fix.<//review><user_name>Derek Riley</user_name><gmap_id>0x80dca77deb144bed:0x50490dd3e24809a4< /gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

Went to this place this morning with my sister and the coffee tasted great till about an hour after getting home, I realized it had a ridiculous amount of espresso in it, I’ve never felt so anxious and uncomfortable with coffee before and I consume caffeine pretty regularly. They definitely overdid something with our drinks and I’d pretty surely say I won’t be returning.< /Text>

< Review>
This place is the best shop Moreno Valley has. Everything here is delicious and affordably priced. Very cozy friendly environment. The best cupcakes I have ever tasted. I always come here and purchase a drink and a treat for myself and others because I want everyone else to try their amazing food. I always go to the Moreno Beach Drive location but they do have a store on Day St. as well. Staff/owners are always friendly. You get a free drink after so many purchases. Come check this place out I guarantee you will fall in love with this spot! I'm craving treats of their menu as I'm writing this review. Too good!!</Review>

Great Food and Customer Service which is actually “Customer First”.

This is a frequent place to have good Coffee, Teas, Breakfast and Lunch with terrific sandwiches that include my favorite the Grilled Lobster Sandwich and the Breakfast Sandwiches theses are made fresh and taste just right.

The Owner is a Genuine Businessman and certainly treats everyone with class and respect there’s a good vibe when you come in and make your order to go or eat in.

Even though Starbucks is next door it’s not the same, the menu here is worth the stop and walk-in you can actually have a good meal with Clam Chowder and a Grilled Sandwich that is made to order with a fabulous Iced Hibiscus Green Tea with a touch of Ginger-mint you can’t compare.

Cupcake Espresso Bar has it down right and no one will be disappointed.<//text>

I ordered in yesterday at Moreno Beach yesterday and sadly they did not have a couple of my cupcake items had asked for and the girl was very helpful she and assertive, exceeding my expectations to make sure i came out with a good ordering experience to what I needed which I greatly appreciate.  The customer service was wonderful also the food is amazing. I ended up getting what I wanted at the other location! Thank you!<//text>

These cupcakes are delicious and reasonably priced. Their coffee isn't anything to write home about, but they can redeem themselves if their lobster grilled cheese is as good as it looks.  I'll be trying it on my next visit.< /text>

The cupcakes are good and service too but I notice that the girl who is handling the cupcakes does not wear a glove and she did not was her hands either before grabbing the cupcakes from the tray. I though this was disgusting due to everything that is going right now. so I just walk away I do not know if theowner( the mayor) needs to talk to them about this major issue since is food handling.<//review>

All moist and delicious.
I have probably tried each flavor. I used go to Creme de la creme but now this is my favorite cupcake place. Cupcakes are $3 or $3.50 depending on flavor. There are even vegan cupcakes. One can order online as well. I usually go there and order. They are alway fast and patient ( takes me a while to decide on what I want). They have coffee there but haven't tried had that. They do have yummy croissant sandwiches.<//Text>

The very convenient thing is that she was able to download their app. So we scrolled through the menu we picked what we wanted to get, prepaid for it, scheduled the time we would be there and confirm the order. We got there right on time an everything was ready for pick up.
Oh man the Braised Chicken and Pesto was absolutely amazing, they had some very good flavors going on with that sandwich. The Caprese was good too, a nice little tease compared to the Chicken though lol.
The coffee's weren't bad, and we did like them but we both agreed that next time we'll add an additional shot of espresso. Cinnamon Honey Latte was really good.  We will definitely be making some return visits here.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dca77deb144bed:0x50490dd3e24809a4< /Gmap_id>< Response>

They're breakfast croissants are a great way to start your morning (weekday or weekend) and I personally enjoy their white chocolate mocha. If you love red velvet as much as I do, definitely stop by here. They sell one of the best red velvet cupcakes!<//Review>

< review>
Ive been visiting this place since it opened some years ago. Every visit is a new wonderful experience and they always have new things to offer. Truly one of the best coffee shops out there, mark my words this place will be world famous. Its perfect for a date or just to lounge around. They offer wifi and a comfortable atmosphere. The workers make you feel welcomed and always have a smile on their faces. This place will not disappoint you. Also plase try the Lobster grilled cheese lemme tell you ghat DAAAMN that was an amazing eat.<//review>

First timers. Great customer service. Cashier was very patient with us while we decided what we were going to get. We ordered a ham and cheese croissant, and a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. Both were very delicious. Also had a caramel frappuccino with no coffee and a dulce de leche latte also both very delicious. Very pleased with our visit. Definitely coming back.< /Text>

I bough a half dozen cup cakes the cake tasted fresh and fluffy the frosting was just right. They have a lot of flavors to choose from. The scones and rice crispy treats looked awesome. They also have a nice variety of coffees and teas iced or hot.</text>

I try to patronize this place when im in the shopping center especially when they put the large name brand competitor in the center which hurts the small business. BUT lately every time I go in and ask a question a particular cashier says "I don't know" as if she can't be bothered to even explain what the beverage is. in the past the staff would be eager to explain to you what something on the menu is...not anymore...its all shrugged shoulders I don't knows and u want it hot or cold.....so dismissive.....It's so disappointing when you have a place you like what they sell, but the service is bad enough that you won't go back.  I gave them 2 stars for the QUALITY of CUPCAKES SNACKS TREATS but ZERO on customer service.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Not only does this place serve delicious cupcakes, savory breakfast sandwiches, and a wide-array of flavorful drinks, but the service is also spectacular!  As a family-owned business, the owners take great pride in their craft and offer a level of friendliness that you just can't find at a franchise.  This is a great place for young professionals and college students who want to relax and enjoy a small snack with a tasty drink.< /text>< pictures>

This Was our first time here.  When I go out for a cupcake,  like to get a big cupcake. My wife can bake cupcakes this size. When we go out for a cupcake,  it is a treat. would like them bigger in size.  But,  can say it did taste good, and the staff was nice and friendly.<//text>

Would have been a 5 for awesome suggestion on coffee! However there were elements that make the cafe feel a bit unloved. Cracked and taped food covers, missing handles on food covers, burnt out light bulbs above bar and on the word cheers on the top shelf behind cashier and a broken lamp cover above bar. Could use a sign out front instead of inside the window to make it a bit easier to find for a first timer.  Otherwise very friendly staff and wonderful coffee and cupcakes!<//text>

Visited this location for the first time and ordered three different cupcakes. I absolutely loved them all. My favorite one was the S’mores cupcake. The cupcakes were all moist and the frostings were all delicious. Cupcakes ranged from about $3-$4, but I definitely think they are worth it. I will definitely be visiting this place again!<//Review>

Cozy. Great staff. Adorable set up. You don't feel rushed, you don't feel like you have to eat everything. You know you can always come back and try something new.
Great location: easy access, good parking.<//review>

It's a nice little quaint place the prices are reasonable and the cupcakes are awesome I I was debating on giving it a 5 because the place was empty when I went in and then a lot of people came in after me and I only had ordered two cupcakes and an iced coffee and for some reason the main person had to run the register and help them and the other person I believe might have been new and she didn't know how to frost cupcakes so I had to wait about 15 minutes but they made it worth it because for my wait and inconvenience they gave me an extra cupcake. Good recovery and I will be back<//Text>

Coffee drinks are better than Starbucks, and the cupcakes and lunch options are delish. Love the atmosphere. Coffee is great for finals or for those long nights with the kiddos.<//Text>

LOVE the Cupcake Bar. My favorite place to study in the I.E! I usually go for the iced chai tea latte and their spinach & feta panini! Great quality service as well. Thanks Cupcake Bar for never kicking me out even if I'm just there to do some work!< /review>

<date>1480813298635< /date><Review>A diamond in the rough. Doesn't have a sign and it's pretty small, but that's the charm of it. A variety of cupcakes and types of coffee. I went there with my fiancee and got a ghiachiatto for each of us; which I've never heard of but they're amazing. I decided to treat her to a cupcake and she thought it was absolutely beyond her expectations. A smores cupcake went above and beyond. Fashions a regular marshmallow and Graham crackers but the cupcake itself takes the cake. I thought it'd be a regular chocolate cupcake, not only did it have that, but it had a marshmallow creme center and a Graham cracker crumble as it's base. Absolutely amazing and would highly recommend going here.</Review>< response>

They were very friendly. I have anxiety in general but they were so kind, passionate and also very fast.  Their professionalism was on par as well! They were so nice to my child and laughed and joked with me so I wouldn’t be scared of the needle.  I wish I knew the nurses names, but I highly recommend them! Can’t wait to do it soon!<//review>

Taylor came to administer IVs after our bachelor and bachelorette parties, and the experience was a total lifesaver (and genuinely enjoyable) before our wedding rehearsal! I have tiny veins, but the whole treatment was simple, painless, and enjoyable, and they were super kind and professional. Highly, highly recommend! Seriously, do not hesitate to book ASAP IVs.<//text>< GmapID>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I was given a special gift from my two girlfriends to help me along with my recovery from being sick. Alidia was my nurse who showed up at my home right on time and got me situated as soon as she arrived. She was super friendly and so wonderful with my crazy pup who wanted all her attention, but she managed to give him lots of love and get my iv therapy going. Alidia made my experience a very pleasant and safe one. I definitely got some good energy back after my session.
I’ve already recruited my girlfriends to join me next time and can’t wait!!</Review>< pictures>

ASAP IVs price to travel to you so you can receive hydration therapy in the comfort of your home is comparable to other places that make you come to them.

Let me start off by saying the staff at ASAP IV is amazing !! Their response to messages/appointments, the time of arrival, and education on the vitamins is wonderful. I had the pleasure of working with Holly and I loved her work ! She arrived early and even asked if she could. She was very professional and very sweet. I really recommend her. Overall I love this company and will definitely be getting more Ivs through them!! Also it’s super easy, simple and quick, love it !< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I had a great experience at ASAP IVS today. It started with a kind and informative chat with Dr. Graber. When I came for my appt, nurse Jenny helped set me up and did a wonderful job inserting the IV. After a life time of being poked for my thyroid, pregnancies, car accidents, etc. I feel like I'm a pin cushion and can tell an experienced nurse from one who isn't. Nurse Jenny is definitely experienced and has great bed side manner. The facility is super clean and esthetically beautiful. I am happy to report I will be back.< /Review>< Pics>

Literally the best thing you’ll ever do.

Too old to drink like you’re in college? Book ASAP IVs
Got carried away and had one too many? Book ASAP IVs
Got a 3 day tradeshow and need to be on best performance but don’t want to miss out on parties? Book ASAP IVs
Had wisdom teeth removed and too scared to drink water cause it hurts? Book ASAP IVs

I did all of the above and ASAP IVs saved my life each time. Nausea, booze-blues, dehydration, headaches etc., gone in 20-30 mins

Staff are phenomenal, punctual, professional, friendly and fun. They turn up when agreed, set up, give you a second lease on life and clean up.

10/10 recommend< /Text>

<Text>ASAP IVS is the best! They were able to fit me into their schedule and helped save my bachelorette weekend! I will absolutely be booking them again in the future. I felt better within 5 minutes of having the iv in.
I look forward to trying some of their other IVs they offer.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

He was organized and everything was sanitary. He came to our hotel and it was quick and painless. I wasn’t feeling great this morning due to vacation things but after my IV, I felt like a million bucks. I got the works which is a whole spread of different vitamins to give me energy and bring me back to a hundred percent. Any time I am in the areas, I will never get an IV from any other company. Thank you so much Taylor!< /Text>< pics>

The staff was very nice and attentive. I’m hard to stick and that can be a challenge for nurses without a lot of experience with dehydrated veins and I have to say it was hard to find a vein but after all tries I successfully got an IV. I’ll be back for sure. For once I needed badly and secondly I felt very well taken care for.< /Review>< resp>

<review>Michael was amazing! We were in San Diego for a bachelorette weekend and needed some hydration. Of course we asked at the final hour and they didn't have any openings for that day but Michael came to our rescue! He was able to fit us in and it was such a great experience. We had some great fun and felt amazing!!<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< UserId.>

<text>Nurse Mel was accommodating and made my IV experience safe and comforting.  ASAP Performance Recovery package immediately made a difference.  I felt rejuvenated right after and i felt like it melted away the soreness I was feeling from my shoulder surgery just weeks before.

On Sunday had my first IV experience and loved it!! Went to their location at Livkraft. Sebastian was wonderful, I didn't feel a thing when he placed my IV. He was super attentive making sure my friend and I were okay and enjoying our experience. I got the Performance IV, I felt amazing after! I will definitely be back!< /text>

My boyfriend has ordered the mobile IV twice from here and it has been super helpful. He had a health scare a few months ago and when he is feeling like his energy levels are super low, he orders the IV and feels much better. His last nurse was Holly and she was super sweet and knowledgeable.< /Text>

ASAP IVs is an absolute breeze to work with. Dr G arrived on time and was so courteous. He came into a home with 3 adults, 2 kids and a hovering dog and took it all in with ease and professionalism. He is very intelligent and educational (if you’re into that nerdy talk..). Not only that but he was able to add on 2 people that weren’t originally scheduled and still managed to leave on time with a smile on his face. Dr. G’s IVs were nearly painless and ran so smoothly I forgot it was even in. I would highly recommend this company as they are available any day of the week AND they genuinely care about their work. Excellent, courteous and compassionate. Looking forward to my next IV already.<//review>

<Review>I would highly recommend ASAP IVs to anyone! My wife and I used their services the morning after our bachelor/bachelorette parties and I'm certain we would not have made it through the rest of the weekends festivities without them! Taylor was on time, professional, and great company as he administered the IVs, taking time to answer any questions we had and making the experience easy and painless. ASAP IVs is a must for anyone seeking hydration and overall wellness solutions or just looking to recover from a long night! There's no one better and I will certainly be using their services again in the future!<//Review>< user>

We called on Super Bowl Sunday fully expecting that it would be tough to find someone to help us. My mom has stage 4 cancer and was severely dehydrated and needed IV fluids but didn’t want to go to the hospital. What a godsend ASAP IVs were. They called us back right away and put us in contact with Melissa. She showed up within the hour right on time. She was kind, compassionate, and made it super comfortable. She also texted us later to see how we were doing. I really think they all go above & beyond. Mom perked up immediately after getting fluids and started feeling much better. We know we will be using them again in order to help her be more comfortable. Thank you ASAP IVs for making our cancer journey a little bit easier.</review>

Scheduled an IV to help with surgery recovery. The process was so easy to book online and the owner himself showed up to administer the IV for me and my husband. He was very friendly and efficient. I have another surgery coming up and will be using them before and after to aid in recovery!<//Text>

I truly believe in the power of Vitamin & Hydration IVs as a quick way to boost the body’s immune. My daughter was recovering from a bout of body aches & fever where she didn’t eat or drink much for 5-6 days. She was exhausted & had no energy. After the immune recovery IV, her blood pressure normalized, her mild fever disappeared, the body aches disappeared & her energy bounced back. It took a few days to fully regain her energy, but she was stronger every day & able to keep up the hydration. I decided to get a Myer’s cocktail to keep up my immune also! I felt great! Amanda, our nurse, was very friendly & knowledgeable! We inundated her w/ questions. She made us feel very comfortable. The process was very easy & relaxing in our own home! I had no idea that a company offered a mobile IV service! It was a perfect solution for us at the time. Thank you!</text>

I have now used ASAP IV twice and I highly recommend them. Both nurses that helped me were wonderful to work with and the Dr was available for my questions too.  I like the full IVs because I like the extra fluid.  I feel like the product is quality and I always feel great after having one.  I like that they are at Livkraft when I’m there  or can be mobile and come to me too!  Great team!<//Review>

When I inquired online to book an appointment, I didn’t expect to get booked so quick but  it was ASAP.
I had the best Nurse, Mel, for my IV Therapy!! I absolutely loved her personality and professionalism.. and most importantly, she got my IV in on the first try.
Love this company, can’t wait to book my next infusion 💜< /Review>

I have tried many companies in the Area and this is one of the best! I definitely recommend using them. I have never had a problem scheduling a same day appointment and pricing is much more competitive then any other companies I’ve seen. Thank god for this company, especially in today’s world. All the nurses are great; Breanna has been so great all the times she has been here.<//review>

Great experience with ASAP IVs. You can go to the hospital and spend 4 hours there, or you can these IV angels come to your house and driver in under an hour. Dr. Garner is awesome and I had the pleasure of working with him as well as Elle. Two committed and passionate professions.

Please give this a go. You will not regret, and you’ll feel great, too!</Review>

I had a fantastic mobile IV Hydration experience. I was able to book the same day and they had many different times available to choose from. It was great having them come to my home. I am NOT a fan of needles but Taylor, the practitioner, got the needle in so smoothly that I didn’t even feel it. He was super friendly, personable, and made me feel completely at ease. I chose the ASAP Works and I instantly began feeling better. I’ve had a headache for 2 weeks and it’s COMPLETELY gone! I’m amazed. I will definitely be doing this again and recommending to all my friends! Thank you SO much ASAPIV!!! 🧡🙏🏼🧡<//Review>

Food poisoning hit me hard last night and I woke up weak and extremely dehydrated. ASAP IV was able to get one of their incredible nurses Elle out to my home in San Marcos within 90 minutes after scheduling. I couldn’t image the availability to be this open everyday, but I was extremely grateful for the quick turnaround!! I feel incredible and won’t use any other Mobile IV Clinic again.< /Review>

This place has been a life changer for my grandmother! She’s been ill and not able to eat or drink adequately for weeks. She’s been so dehydrated and malnourished. We were recommended Myers Cocktail for her and it gave her back some life! We are so very grateful with the quick and readily communication and easy scheduling. Many times they’ve had same day appointments. Thank you : )<//Text>

Felt lousy all day. Dehydrated, nausea, and couldn’t keep anything down. Called ASAP IV and was taken care of immediately and professionally. My nurse Elle arrived with a great attitude, and knowledge of everything I had questions on before, during, and after.
Everything went smoothly and I feel better already!
100% recommend this business to anyone who needs it!
Thanks again Elle!< /review>

I woke up in desperate need of a hangover IV so I contacted ASAP IVs. I was able to get a same day appointment and within hours a nurse was at my house. I'm deathly afraid of needles and Breanna made me feel at ease and got my IV on the first try! She was very knowledgeable and explained everything along the way. Definitely recommend ASAP IVs and will be using them again! :)</text>

Truly a blessing. Very easy to get same day appointment, very well priced.

Alex Gonzalez was AMAZING. Our Appointment was at 4:30, he called to let us know he was on his way and be to us in 10  minutes.( he was)  He had all his equipment, was very professional,  He seemed generally concerned about what the needs were and very attentive. Alex was gentle and kind. we have used 2 different mobile services in the past and All were Great. Alex visit stood out to me for several reasons. A few things
that were different As
He was talking to us and calling the Doctor he had all his stuff lined up ready to go, He used gloves but changed them out when touching other things, he didnt leave any trash. Alex made us feel like we have known him for years. It was an amazing experience under very yucky circumstances. He also talked highly of the Doctor who was just as amazing as he talked to me on the phone as well. Alex let us know that all the Staff are great that work for ASAP IVs.  Thank you Alex for your service yesterday and because of you we will definitely use ASAP IVs for our furture needs.
Beyond happy,

<review>Dr. Graber was great! I spoke with over the phone & was able to schedule an apt for the next day very easily. I was fighting a cold & wanted to get the immune boosting IV & my husband wanted to get it as well. We were able to have the IV at the same time at our home while our kiddos played. It was super easy. Super comfortable. Dr. Graber answered all of our questions & was comfortable to be around. We will definitely use again!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I had such a great experience with Asap IVs. I made the reservation a little less than 2 hours before and they were able to come to the house within the hour - so prompt (guess they’re called ASAP IVs for a reason)! Their customer service and mobile IV service are amazing, nothing I have ever experienced before. I will definitely be recommending this company to all my friends. Our RN, Olivia or Liv, was so sweet and very professional. I love the convenience of getting IVs right at home and the quick, fast response time in booking an appointment.< /Text>

I had such an amazing experience with ASAP IVs and they are definitely the place to choose for your next IV! I had the ASAP Recovery IV done and it saved me from the night prior of excessive drinking!! They were able to come out to me in an hour and got me feeling better in no time. I will definitely be using them for all of my future IVs. Thank You ASAP IVs Team!<//Review>

We are new to town and a nurse in Arizona had heard of ASAP IV’s.  I was feeling rundown and was able to get an appointment within a few hours.  I regularly get an infusion for an auto immune disease and Elle was the best IV nurse I have ever had - just a small sting.  Both my husband and I got the ASAP Immune Recovery and shortly thereafter felt amazing.  Thank you ASAP IV’s we will be regulars.<//Text>

Wow, this mama of two (like many others, I'm sure) had been neglecting self-care, especially during COVID-19. I had never received an IV outside of an injury/hospitalization purpose and Jenni made it incredibly comfortable. I wasn't sure if I'd be in the mood to talk, or if she'd wait in her car, but we ended up gabbing the entire hour she was on my patio and I felt human again. The appointment convenience, price, and professionalism was outstanding. I'll be using and referring ASAP IVs as long as they're in town!<//text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>ASAP IV's -- wow, how quick, easy and convenient! I am a Functional Medicine Physician running an online practice...and it goes without saying I understand the value of self-care and recognized my own burnout and the need to give my body the nutrition it deserves in the quickest, most effective way possible--an IV! It's a big time-saver to have a mobile company com to me. I really enjoy the large selection of IV's and boosters the company has to offer. What I like even more is their overall set-up that gets them in an out in 30-45 minutes max. I had the pleasure of working with Hayden, and she was wonderful, professional and we shared great conversation.

I'm looking forward to working with them again and again!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I wanna thank Breanna and Marla for their great service and professionalism . After my recovery from covid I felt really weak, so I went a head and set up an appointment for the very first time and let me tell you I feel great!  this boosts your immune system so quickly and I highly recommend this. If you are looking to feel better don't hesitate to contact ASAP IV
Thanks again Breanna and Marla for the great service.  Definitely doing this again.<//Review>

I have been sick for days. I knew I couldn’t get better because I was so dehydrated. I would drink so much water but my kidneys haven’t been functioning correctly so I would end up throwing up all the water and pedialyte. I called the hospital and they said there was no point coming in because they were only taking people with respiration problems. I felt so helpless. I remembered some companies to mobile IVs. I called ASAP and Breanna came out. She was a rock star. Very sweet and very thorough. She made me feel safe. We did the treatment outside to keep us all safe. I had energy, less nausea and less pain. She really knew what to put in there. I already scheduled for tomorrow. This company saved me.< /Review>

Tried this company for the first time today. I was skeptical at first to do the IV from home but it was AMAZING! We had Joy B as our nurse and she did such a great job!! We were able to have the IVs from the comfort of our home and everything was so sanitary and professional. Definitely recommend trying this!!  I feel great and can’t wait to recommend this to my friends & schedule again. -Sarena Mezzacappa</Text>

It was a Gold star service all around very convenient. Ellie the Nurse who came to our house was great. It took her one try to start the IV.< /Text>

I love ASAP IVs! I was able to book a last minute appointment and the hangover IV made me feel so much better. Hayden did a great job inserting the IV - it was virtually painless! I will absolutely use this company again.< /Review>

I had the pleasure of having Molly in our house, she did a very nice and gentle job while inserting the IV needle into my vein.  This is the 3rd time I have the Myers Cocktail (B12 , magnesium, vitamin C, etc) works like a charm for me , as an energy booster and to prevent diseases.  Thank you, I’m feeling great.<//Review>

My experience was awesome! Dr. Graber was very nice and made us feel comfortable and safe. The facility is spotless and the practice and handling of everything was very clean and hygienic. Customer service and communication is great, I messaged to set up an appointment ASAP at the last minute and Dr. Graber was very open and understanding. Overall experience was definitely 10/10 and I would definitely recommend getting any service!< /text>

This is my 2nd time using ASAP IV's , after feeling a little tired and sluggish we decided to book for a in-home visit. R.N MEL showed up and did an amazing job.
She put us at ease and made the process comfortable . This time I tried a different cocktail per her recommendation and boy did it hit the spot! She had us charged up and ready to go crush the week! She's a true pro! Thanks again, I'll see you guys soon!!!<//Text>

<review>ASAP IV provides an incredible IV therapy experience. Scheduling an at home IV appointment was so easy, it took only 30 minutes for an IV specialist to arrive at my door. Nurse Olivia was professional and made the experience comfortable and enjoyable. At the end of the appointment, my hangover was totally cured. I will definitely be ordering another IV ASAP.</review>< Pics>

I was super impressed with our nurse Joy. She was very professional and knowledgeable about her practice. She found my vein the first time and it was a painless and comfortable process. I highly recommend this company and defiantly request Joy as your nurse! -Kevin</Text>

Post bachelor party fishing trip and massively sea sick... ASAP IV's came in quick, easy and painlessly to totally turn us around and keep the party going strong. I've never had a hangover/bought of sea sickness disappear faster!
I'd recommend to anyone and everyone having a bachelor/bachelorette party and keep that party going strong<//Review>

Friendliest professionals helping you feel your best when bothered by a bug or just in need of a pickup.  Rather than going to a ER to get fluids and nausea meds they come to me in the safety of my own home. Highly recommend.< /text>

Heading to Palm Springs for 3 days of heated golf so I went for one of their Athletic Drips.  I spoke to Dr. Graber directly.  After working out the quick details I booked the appt online with ease.  The location was super clean comfortable and professional. Elle was the nurse who attended to me and was super attentive and informative.  I'll be back for sure.<//Review>

I had been feeling under the weather & dehydrated & decided to look for an IV therapy service in San Diego, after much research I came across ASAP IVs. There was a last minute change & Dr. Graber himself came to my home within a couple of hours.  The procedure took less than 45 minutes and I felt better INSTANTLY! Dr. Graber was prompt, great company, knowledgeable and really cares about his patients. I’ll definitely be booking this service again!</review>

I would never use another mobile IV service again. Not only did they stay true to their claim of rapid service , they where on time, personal and knew exactly what my husband needed to help with his flare up due to GI issues. You won’t regret using them!</Text>

We called ASAP IVs after a long week at Lake Havasu.  We called on a Friday, asked if they could come to our home that afternoon and they made it happen!  They were communicative, friendly, professional, and made our first mobile IV therapy so easy.  Hayden was our nurse and we hit it off immediately!  I will definitely be calling them again and would highly recommend ASAP IVs to anyone who needs to get hydrated asap!< /review>

Chill, clean, safe environment. Professional and friendly staff. Came in with a really bad hangover, started feeling better within minutes of the IV. I got the upgrade with magnesium and b12. I recommend it. Dr. Graber is a pro.</review>

What a great experience. Taylor was extremely kind and professional, and responded to me much faster than the other companies I contacted. Booking was easy, the services are well priced, and the actual process was  quick and painless. I would definitely use ASAP again in the future.</text>

<Text>Dr. Taylor made for a great and easy experience - would definitely recommend for the mobile service to have IV’s in the comfort of your living room. I loved how easy the whole process was and he was very knowledgeable, always checking that each step of the process was thoroughly described as well as calmly executed since you’re dealing with needles. I would definitely recommend for my friends, family, and colleagues to use. And I feel great post care so it must have worked! I can’t wait to try out their LivKraft location, and since I posted on social media I already have friends wanting to try with me too! Thanks again!< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

<Text>ASAP IVs was amazing! We had a large group doing the hangover IVs after a night out and it was truly a lifesaver! They were extremely professional, the IV was painless and the process was very quick. It was so convenient that they set everything up right in the comfort of your own home.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>After a (virtual) beer pong tournament things got a little crazy and I woke up feeling like death. Booked a same day visit from ASAP IVs and got their hangover treatment. Dr. Graber was AMAZING—I can’t say enough great things about the experience. The IV was nearly painless, every step was explained thoroughly, and I felt 100% at the end of the treatment. Being able to do the treatment in the comfort of your own home is hard to top. Will definitely be using ASAP IVs again, but hopefully just for the wellness treatments and not monster hangovers ;)</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

I wasn’t feeling too well , I think I just had a stomach bug for a few days. I was really sick and dehydrated, I knew I needed an IV and going to the hospital wasn’t an option for me because all I needed was an IV with fluids. The first day Camron came and was super nice . It was my first time getting an IV at home . The 2nd day I decided to get another one Hayden came . She was also super friendly and they both made me feel so comfortable in my own home. Both very nice and seemed to care about their jobs . Next time I’m feeling sick or dehydrated I’ll be giving them a call again ! I HIGHLY recommend checking them out . I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!!!</review>

<Text>After drinking wayy to much the night before, I was still hungover, nauseous, and unable to eat still at 3:00pm. So I called a nurse from ASAP IVs to come to my place. Nurse Olivia Leroux was so sweet and bubbly, talked me down on my needle anxiety, and even with my super tiny veins she got one right away. Now my headache is gone and I feel hungry and back to normal! Thank you so much Olivia!</Text></record></dataset><record>

AMAZING! I had my bachelorette party of 16 girls in San Diego. We called ASAP IVs to help us recover from the night before with the Hangover IV. I definitely feel much better! They were professional, easy, fast, and able to accommodate all of us! We were able to all congregate on the couch and enjoy our morning coffee while the ASAP team worked around us so it was no interruption to our day. I definitely recommend .< /Review>

Thank you Jenni & AsapIV ! There is no match to feeling better faster then getting an IV. I was so thankful to Jenni for providing a quick & painless session. I was sick and on antibiotics; There was no way I could drink enough to rehydrate and I was feeling the effects; One IV later and I’m finally feeling back to my original self. Will absolutely be a returning customer .. Your health is worth it !<//text>

As a physician, I can wholeheartedly  recommend Dr. Graber and his business! From start to finish I was highly impressed with the process. Easy scheduling, beautiful and spotless clinic, and amazing customer service and professionalism by Dr. Graber. Dr. Graber was very gentle placing my IV and I felt great after my infusion. Will definitely be going back. 5 stars!!!!<//Text>

<text>My husband and I were visiting La Jolla for a long weekend and felt like we needed a little pick-me-up after running around the last few days. We made same day appointments with ASAP IVs at their weekend clinic in Downtown La Jolla and were SO impressed! Upon entering, safety precautions were a number one priority and we were quickly greeted by the RN who got us started with our IVs. We opted for the Refuel IV (only took about 30ish minutes) and although I normally get squirmy with needles, the RN was professional, gentle and so quick that I hardly felt a thing! Wishing we had an ASAP IVs back home!<//text><rating>5</rating><UserId.>103394516701816943293</UserId.><Date>1592842204805<//Date></record>

We frequent La Jolla and were recommended to check out ASAP IVs during our trip for some much needed rehydration. Sign up was super easy and we were able to schedule same day appointments. They are located within Livkraft, which is a wellness spa, with infrared saunas and float pods among other services. The facility was very COVID conscious and our temperatures were taken after arriving. Within a few minutes the nurse took us to the room for our treatment. Chairs were very comfortable and the room was calming. The nurse was very personable and easily placed the IVs with minimal discomfort. Before I knew it my IV was flowing! Took about 30 minutes or so, the nurse came out and checked on us a few times to make sure we were okay. After another patron left, their seat was immediately sanitized and cleaned, so they are taking the necessary precautions which is reassuring. Next thing I knew my IV was done, I felt great and we were on our way! They have multiple options for IVs depending on what you want, which is really convenient. This is their only current in-person location, but the nurse told me they will travel to wherever you are and can do this in the comfort of your own home, a huge plus! Overall it was a great experience, the nurse was awesome, and we felt better afterwards. Highly recommend ASAP IVs!!< /text>

<review>We just went for our first IV experience through ASAP IVs at their Livkraft collaboration in La Jolla. If I had the money, I think I would do this every day! Didn’t have a chance to grab a morning coffee, but by the end of my Myer’s IV I was awake, alert, and feeling super refreshed and ready for the day. Olivia, our nurse, was super professional, skilled at IV placement, and made us feel comfortable. Everything at Livkraft was super clean and they set some great vibes. We watched One Planet while listening to club music. It was a revelation! Thanks ASAP and LivKraft for an awesome IV experience!</review>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Amazing Experience! I’ve been really low on energy and I needed something to pick me up. I called ASAP IV’s and less then an hour later they were at my front door. Dr. Graber administrated my treatment. I told him what I was lacking and he knew exactly what I needed. Dr. Graber is professional, personable, knowledgeable, and has a very gentle touch. He took his time with me and explained everything in Detail. I was lucky enough to get Taylor but I’m sure everyone who works with him would be excellent too. If your skittish around needles there is no need to worry. The entire experience was so comforting and they take extra special care to make sure they only need to stick you once and they talk you through the whole process and they use very small needles so your not uncomfortable and you don’t bruise. I can already feel the immune booster therapy working it’s magic. Thank you ASAP IV’s for all that you do. The only complaint I have is that I didn’t find them sooner. If you are in need of some energy, have a cold or maybe just had a bit too much to drink the night before call them immediately. You won’t regret it.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I have nothing but amazing things to say about Dr. Graber and ASAP IVs. I was feeling dehydrated and sluggish so I booked an appointment. The booking process was extremely easy and in no time Dr. Graber was at my door to offer me his IV Immunity Booster.  He was extremely professional and only uses hospital grade medications and equipment (trust me - I work in a hospital!). My IV placement was less painful than an eyebrow wax and in no time I was underway with my booster treatment.  The IV infusion took about 45 minutes and I was on my way to recovery.  No bruise, no soreness, and I’ll be booking him again in a few weeks. Thanks for an amazing experience and I’m feeling so much better!</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I booked ASAP IVs for a bachelorette party and I’m so glad I did this!! The company is relatively new, but you’d never know based on the owner’s experience (he’s an MD). Seriously, the girls all really appreciated it and we felt better in 30 min or less. Painless, affordable, and super convenient experience. Taylor worked with us on scheduling and pricing!

If you need hangover recovery or anti-nausea help for any other reason, I HIGHLY recommend the ASAP Recovery Package - it’s more expensive, but I think it definitely made the difference for me. I felt good as new.<//review>

<name>Valerie Urias</name><text>I went in today for a full set.  I asked for coffin shape. The lady rushed through doing my nails, 2 of my nails were oval not coffin, 4 of them were shorter than the rest. I'll never go here again. I had to find another nail salon to have them re-done. If your looking for good work and someone to take their time to do what you like, then check out icon nails in Claremont. Ask for Ben.<//text>< UserId.>

The girl who did my nails was really nice. I got my  acrylic nails done on March 26 2019 Tuesday and they only lasted till April 1st 2019 Monday. It didn’t even last a week. It was a waste of $26. I wouldn’t go here if you are going for the same thing.</Review>

With my job and my beautiful 7month old grandbaby its hard to get to my favorite place to do my pedi's, gel nails and eyebrows but always try to make it there. They have excellent friendly customer service and excellent work in whatever you want done. Wish they were closer to me.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I went to go get a full set and asked for long and coffin but a lady with short brown hair made them oval and short. Was disappointed and she charged me $30. She did not listen to what I was telling her hope I got her name.</Text>

Staff are welcoming, professional and very efficient. The office and dental stations are well designed, state of the art equipped and immaculate. Dr. Albers has worked on my teeth for many years from cavities to bonding a broken tooth to crowns when needed.  I appreciate his thoughtfulness and care not pushing  to do work that may not be needed. The hygienists there have given me the most thorough cleanings I’ve ever had. Highly recommended.</Review>

The exam and exrays, consultation are very through.  Dr. Albers explains everything clearly.  Even better is Dr.Steve Murphy, the endodontist who was extremely helpful in determining I did not need the root canal.
They do not do work that is not necessary.
The office staff and dental assistance services were great too.
I highly recommend this office.<//text>

<review>This place is absolutely phenomenal. Dr. Albers is extremely professional along with his entire staffed team. Everyone is detail oriented and put you first as a patient. I myself am not a fan of dental work, but this team of professionals make the experience well worth the visit and all future business for my dentistry. Front desk is extremely knowledgeable and communicative, every specialist, assistant, and doctor in the building exceed all expectations in terms of their practice, communication, and knowledge. This was the best service of any kind I have had in years. Thank you all for your amazing work!</review>< gmapID>

Dr. Albers is the "Best".  If anyone can diagnose and properly treat dental needs, it  is him.
He was recommended by a retired orthodontist who described  him as "The Professor".  I have to agree 100%.< /review>< gmapID>

Dr. Albers has been my dentist for the past few years.
my mouth was pretty bad before I started with him and I will still need many implants and crowns till I'm back to normal but I couldn't be luckier or happier that I will be getting it done here. he has the knowledge to tackle any problem. very experienced doctor. very lovely staff. they work smart and quick and will get you on the right track.< /review>

I drove over 3 hours for my appointment as there’s not the greatest care where I live. My anxiety was through the roof and they helped ease it. They talked me through everything they were doing  and explained it all. I know I have a long road ahead of me but I left feeling 10x better than I did on my way in.

i've not gone to the dentist in many years because i found my old dentist's office to be patronizing, and i remember the discomfort of the cleaning vividly! but Dr. Albers and his staff were SO wonderful. They walked me through every step of the process and perhaps most importantly *used numbing solution* on my gums so the pokey pokey was significantly less pokey. Everyone was incredibly nice and helpful, Dr. Albers was knowledgeable and I trust his opinion. People took extra time and care. A solid 5/5< /review>

<text>Always extremely professional, courteous and friendly. I have been a patient of Dr. Harry Albers for over 13 years. It’s been an amazing experience and my teeth and overall mouth health have improved dramatically.

I’m in high tech career wise, so I really appreciate that Dr. Albers pushes High Tech advancements within the dental technology industry.

It’s always a comfortable and comprehensive experience from the moment I sit down.

I researched top dentists back in 2004 when I first became a patient, and I’m glad I did. The whole team has been amazing all these years.< /text><UserId.>109897157753647790443<//UserId.>< pictures>

Been to many dentists but since I found Dr. Albers about 5 years I have not gone anywhere else. He is extremely knowledgeable, he teaches at UCSF School of Dentistry. He knows what plan of action is best for me and has saved me doing work on teeth I would possibly lose or have crowned (multiple dentists have done work on teeth and charged me then decided to remove or crown them!). The quality of work is extremely high, I have had previous permanent fillings removed and the temporary fillings by Albers lasted much longer! The environment is calming and he is aware of your level of comfort and fear of pain. Everyone who works at the office is knowledgeable and nice. I have referred my family members to Albers office to get the quality care I want them to get. No one has come close to Albers in my experience.< /review></record>

<text>Excellent office and staff.  Dr. Albers is friendly and professional.  The front desk was on point and knowledgeable regarding my insurance.  The dental assistants were warm friendly and worked with confidence. They managed to get me in short notice so I could take advantage of my insurance.

< review>
My cleaning went well, very wet but well and much needed. I really appreciated that Renee took the time to plan out my treatment plan, going into detail of importance and how to address the costs. I do not have insurance and will be paying out of pocket so it is imperative that I plan my visits strategically and in as less as possible. I am looking forward to my deep cleaning, crown on front tooth and working with dentist to address color fix to front fillings. More importantly I can't wait to smile with my teeth again! Renee made me confident this was achievable. Another huge plus is the women in the front are absolutely and refreshingly sweet, professional and have such a pleasant ambiance. Thank you for taking me in as a new patient!< /review>

During all of my visits, I was treated with the up-most respect and heart-felt caring. I have claustrophobia and was concerned how this would be received and dealt with--well, I can tell you it was a concern that disappeared quickly. I was made to feel at ease immediately. I had several implants and I am happy to say that I have a wonderful smile again and have received many compliments on my beautiful teeth. I drive 100 miles to this office and it is worth it.

His assistant Ari is quite talented himself.

<Review>Whenever I step into Dr. Albers office I'm met with friendly professionals who truly care about educating and informing me about dental care. I've received more information through their office about how plaque builds, daily dental care and anything to keep my eye on etc...which allows me to leave the visit feeling empowered and capable of taking care of things before they get out of hand and higher cost. They have been very considerate of my budget as well. I don't like going to the dentists in general, but I feel safe and cared for in their office, something I've never really experienced before. Thank you Harry Albers!</Review>< Pics>

When I went to see him I had already gone to three others dentist for a gum infection. I even had a recommendation to have surgery from another dentist and have my teeth exposed. Dr. Alber took one look at it and injected me with an antibiotic, had two treatments and my gums are good. He's my new dentist now.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>I went here after a bike accident in which my front two teeth got knocked into my gums. Dr. Albers is an excellent doctor with deep understanding of teeth and their structural integrity. He suggested we try to save my teeth instead of replacing them with a root canal procedure. Despite my second and third opinion dentists suggesting otherwise, I listened to Dr. Albers and I'm happy to say he was right. My teeth are still vital like he promised and I got to keep my original ones. Would highly recommend him!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Liz was my hygienist, and was the first time she cleaned my teeth.  She explained the procedure very well and was very perceptive of my needs during the procedure (suction, water, pressure, etc.)  I felt she was thorough, but fast.  I was happy with the experience, although I hate going to the dentist.  I give Liz 5 stars so far.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8084480a2c5b8f03:0x2b385c30041b750a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent, exceedingly thorough dentist.  He is the Albert Einstein of dentistry.

On follow-up visits, Dr. Albers checks and analyzes problems quickly.  He deals with it as promptly as possible and shows you your different options.

I highly recommend Dr. Albers!!

What a relief to know this office handles issues correctly and stays on top of things and keeps an eye on situations.

The team at Albers & Associates recently handled an emergency situation for me in admirable fashion.  Late on a Friday afternoon I had a crown come out, and when I rushed frantically over to their office, they calmed me down, put me in a chair, cemented the crown back in temporarily and made an appointment to have the dentist fix me up.  They turned what could have been a very difficult experience into a "no problem sir, don't worry" moment.   Their willingness to make my problem their priority is typical of this office.   Best dental office ever.</Text>

I was seen by a dental hygienist who was so knowledgeable that I understood and appreciated why I have to use my electric tooth brush.  I am going to stay committed to its use.
I also learned about how harmful bacteria is spread, how it is eliminated, and that keeping its presence to the bare minimum through good dental hygiene can extend my health and life.<//Text>

Thoughtful explanations of what work was needed and why. Patient with my occasional discomfort and mindful of my insurance coverage. Staff is excellent.</Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I've enjoyed coming to Dr Albers and Asc. for the last five years. It was immediately a comfortable experience. From the front desk, to the hygienists and assistants I've worked with, to Dr Albers himself. All friendly and knowledgeable. I had not been to the dentist in 25 yrs prior to coming here! They got me up to speed and into good dental health quickly and comfortably. My only complaint would be a billing discrepancy that they did correct and reverse as soon as I figured it out. These guys are great. Im very happy here< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8084480a2c5b8f03:0x2b385c30041b750a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very trust worthy staff and environment...makes me feel right at home... for someone like me who had bad experiences with prior dental offices and dentists... I’m definitely over my fears with this place... I definitely recommend Harry Albers D.D.S...</review>

<text>When I went in for my first visit the staff was great and the amount of information that was given was greatly appreciated. I returned to have a broken tooth repaired. Dr. Albers admitted that I had one of the most difficult crown preps he's seen in many years. I never felt uneasy or not confident in his ability to handle my case with nothing less than the best care. The results were amazing. I feel very pleased that I chose Dr. Albers as my dentist.<//text><time>1379130187602< /time><Name>Craig Steele<//Name><UserId.>116481079455218466789< /UserId.>< gmapID>

Top to bottom extremely happy with this company and would recommend them to anyone in the greater Sacramento area.

After seeing some of the work they did for a family member we had 2 sliding doors installed both in our living room and bedroom. From the minute when Taylor, the design consultant, came over we knew we were in good hands. The install was all done in 1 day for both doors very professionally by Serge. Everyone we interacted with at Reliable was on time and extremely responsive.

Some things people don't often think about- Reliable carries adequate liability insurance, products were backed by warranty, all employees are W2. All this were very important to us beyond just the work they did.

Great product, great price, excellent install. Not much more you can ask for, Reliable will be our first call going forward with all home improvement projects.

Here are some after and before pics of the work they did.</review>

This is our third project with Reliable Home improvement.  That is probably the best review right there.  The current project was a granite look, colored, concrete walkway and patio in our backyard.  It turned out fabulous!   What I especially appreciate is the experience they have at creative transitions. We have a very sloped lot, but they tied the existing deck and other features into the new pour beautifully.  Absolutely recommend.</Text>

We chose Reliable Home Improvement to remodel the wet area of our guest bathroom. I had found them using a Google search and saw that they had rather good reviews. We met with Cliff to get our estimate and he was very professional and friendly. He was very upfront with us about cost and what was involved with the remodel. We were worried about water damage behind the shower wall. All three companies we got estimates from said they couldn't give us an idea of cost of repair for the water damage since they couldn't see behind the wall. Anyway, in the end we went with Reliable. Cliff did warn us about the start time for the project. They were scheduling out six months. We were expecting this because COVID has slowed manufacturing way way down so getting the fixtures we wanted could take a long time. We met with Cliff in March and all of our bathroom fixtures came in the beginning of June. Reliable started our project towards the end of June. Laura was our project contact. She came out and met with us and gave us all the info we needed to pick out fixtures. She was also very friendly and very professional. Both she and Cliff were very knowledgeable. This is our first home so obviously we know nothing about remodeling ANYTHING. We had A LOT of questions. Jason was our installer. He was great to work with. He was very professional and really friendly. My husband and I work from home and we were worried about noise and such while the bathroom was getting redone. Jason did his best to keep the noise to a minimum. As much as you can when you’re demolishing a bathroom. Jason made sure to get our input on placement and installation of things before putting them in. Our bathtub we had ordered had somehow got broken during shipment. Jason and Reliable made every effort to get a replacement tub right away. The project was only setback a day. The project took about two weeks to complete. The end result was absolutely amazing! Our new bathtub, water fixtures, and tile are gorgeous! Everything came out looking so good. Jason did an incredible job. There were a couple issues that needed to be taken care of post installation. Jason came out the same day and fixed them. With no issues and no hidden costs at the end. Working with Reliable was a wonderful experience. They may not the cheapest contractors in town, but they are also not the most expensive. Trust me, you get what you pay for. I would highly highly recommend!<//review>

Reliable was fast, efficient, and affordable. Our bathroom was transformed in two short weeks. There was zero pressure to spend, and with the one unexpected hiccup that occurred the fox was fast and affordable. The crew was polite and responsible. Everything happened on time. We will be using Reliable again to transform our family room and any additional work we need!<//Review>

Removing the old siding and replacing it with stucco has transformed our home's curb appeal. Looks Great. We were impressed with Cliff's (saleman) professional attitude, he answered all our questions regarding the project and each phase. The workers were on time, courteous. Shawn (owner) personally oversaw our stucco project, so we knew we were in good hands. Reliable does excellent quality work. I would recommend Reliable to anyone searching for a home improvement project.

<Text>Everything went well.  However I have an issue with the quarter round molding in the kitchen.  I should have mentioned it earlier but I apologize  for not. Because the wood was so raw, I could have used a second coat of stain.  Thanks again.  Ed.< /Text><user_id>117917760187300737235</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Love Reliable! They installed a tiered rock retaining wall and it is amazing. They had done my windows before and were excellent. This project was even bigger. I am so pleased that I am asking for help with another project.<//Review>

We used Reliable Home Improvement to remove our old driveway and pour a new driveway, as well as widen our cement path on the side of our garage. We were approached due to them doing work in the area and was given a 10% coupon if we hired them. The process for getting a quote was easy, and the representative was friendly and informative. We were originally looking for quotes for a different remodel project, but decided to complete a cheaper project now rather than wait longer to complete the more expensive remodel. During the initial quote process, we were told they could give special pricing that day for cement work because they were low on work in that area at the time. I did mention the coupon, and had it on the counter visible while discussing with the rep our various projects and our ideas for cement out front. We were given their regular price, and then their "best and final price" if we signed the contract same day. We agreed and moved forward with scheduling the job for the cement work. I should have done the math at the consultation, but realized after payment that the "best and final" price was not even the 10% discount that we had been given on the coupon. We were soon contacted by the project manager Patrick to schedule the job. He called twice more to delay our job due to other jobs taking longer than expected. Once our job was finally scheduled and happening, the crew arrived on time and made quick work of the demo and setting the forms. However, the forms were not set right, and they blamed the inadequate photos and unclear instructions that their own company had provided them. The error was fixed the next morning before pouring, but was still not the width that we had originally agreed on. They cut through a few sprinkles, but fixed the line. During demolition they also crushed our sewage cap and said they would be back out in a few days to replace it with a new one, and would also rebury our cable cords. We noticed after the crew had left for the day, that they had scraped the excess cement from their shoes or tools onto our sprinkler head, which had dried cement plugging the holes, and we had to clean and pick out, which was very frustrating. A few days later, someone came by to rebury the cable, but no new sewer cap. After a week had gone by, I reached back out to Patrick and he was unaware that it hadn't been fixed and said it would be done in the next couple of days. Another week went by with no sewer cap, and no contact from the company. We then started seeing sewage coming out of the open broken hole into our yard. The County came out and assessed the line, and found that several large parts of the plastic sewer cap had gone down into the line and caused a clog. They fixed the issue and replaced our sewer cap. All in all, the driveway looks nice and we are glad we got it redone, but I don't know if I would use this company again. Which is unfortunate, because we were really hoping to find a company we could continue to use for other projects and have a trusted relationship with.< /text>

Has no respect for boundaries, and can not follow the most basic of customer requests.

When I contacted Jeff, he explained that when they see "no soliciting" they make it a point to "not knock or ring the bell, but just leave a flyer."

Edit to respond:
I appreciate the response.

A mailer or other solicitation is something I don't get upset over. Advertisement is part of life.

That sign was the politest way I could say, "yes I mean you!"

When a vendor hears an upset dog, keeps coming, see the sign & thinks "I'm already here, I might as well" I have a problem.

I have a Ring video that shows the dog start barking before your person gets to the door, he continues to approach, sees the sign, and casually tosses your advertisement on the ground like litter I have to clean up.

Update 5/4/21:
Contrary to the response below, today another copy of the same flyer was stuffed in my door handle.

Update 2:
I tried calling the number on the flyer. Jeff seems too remember my number, said he had nothing to say to me, and then hung up on me. Since the owner responded below before I've called found the office number to try talking to them.</Review>

Their work crews were on time, always left the work site clean, and because the company has all phases of construction people working with them, there is no waiting for sub-contractors to come.
I would highly recommend this company.

I have had my floors and then my master bathroom done by Reliable, and both projects turned out beautifully.  I love my new bathroom and am excited about my next home improvement project - my patio.  They were easy to work with and helped me select just the right materials that coordinated just perfectly.  Very pleased with both the quality of the work and the professionalism and courtesy of the workers during the remodeling process.< /Review>

We signed a contract with Reliable after receiving 5 other bids.
The work consisted of 2 complete bathroom remodels and new tiling in our entry hall.
Reliable is aptly named as they completed the job on time with few noticeable interruptions to our daily life.  Jason was chosen to perform the actual work and showed himself to be a true artisan.  I would recommend him for any home project because of his professionalism, attitude and desire to please the customer at all costs.< /review>

< review>
I have had three projects done by Reliable Home Improvement.  The first was replacing the countertops in my kitchen.  They did a great job.  I like the fact that they make sure that all state and city codes are met.  They do little extra things like replace all the kitchen electrical outlets and plates so they all match.  They even came with me to Arizona Tile to pick out quartz slab for the counter tops.

The second project was replacing two sliding glass doors.  They were removed and installed in one day.  The doors also came with screens.

The third project was a complete remodel of the hall bathroom.  You get complete freedom to choose flooring, vanity, countertops, paint, mirrors, tubs, and faucets.  The company gives you recommendations of where to shop, but you are free to shop as you please.  If you ask they will give you some recommendations which I have found to be useful.  Occasionally, there will be restrictions due to codes.  I love the way my bathroom looks now.  This was all done during covid, and I felt no pressure when the vanity I wanted took a couple of months to arrive at my house.

I am now in the process of having my Master Bathroom remodeled by  Reliable.

Some of the things that I like about the company are the following.  They do not start a project until all items have arrived.  Once they start the project, they stay until the project is finished.  They clean up after themselves each day.  They do not smoke on the property.  Except in a rare circumstance, they do not use foul language.  They are punctual.
Everyone is very polite.

A warning.  Reliable warns that there will be dust, but if you are having tile work done, I suggest you cover up any furniture, curtains and blinds.  The tile dust is thick and can be difficult to remove.<//review>

Laura Brock was always right on the spot and very responsive to every request and requirement that was needed or desired. Her staff was also on top of everything and very responsive and professional and knew what they were doing.

<Review>My husband and I had 3 major projects done on our home over the winter. First we had new flooring installed. We chose luxury vinyl plank (golden oak) style. After looking at a slab flooring throughout our home for 6 years after some flooding, we finally had something nice to look at. I'm still admiring these floors. Our whole house was done, including closets. A couple of mishaps though while the work was being done, one being they scuffed a good 2 foot area while sliding the hutch back into place in the dining room. BUT they were able to buff it out with a solution specifically made for that. The other issue was I believe it was Juan, he broke one of the ceramic bathroom tiles while working around that doorway in that area and didn't tell us about it. They had to glue the strip across the doorway and had blue painters tape in place for 24 hours. So the following day when I removed the tape, I saw the 3 cracks. Shawn the owner did offer to have his guys replace that tile but at the time we didn't know where they were stored so we said forget it. Also the furniture in the living room they had put back before I had a chance to sweep the floors or vacuum up the pieces left behind when they swept. I wanted to vacuum it all up but the crew wanted to have the living room done so we'd have a room to enjoy while they worked on the rest of the house. Also the baseboards were left with smudges, scratches, and some small chipped areas that Juan's crew filled in with caulking. Every single room had such dirty baseboards that my husband and I decided to paint over them. They were so ugly, they looked 20 years old with family scuff marks over time. They did not look brand new at all. But hey, we have new flooring and baseboards but I do have my work cut out for me moving the furniture out in every room to properly clean the floors and paint the baseboards.
That said, next job was new windows. Anlin, tinted windows. They work so well to keep the heat out, I'm freezing in the winter time even with the curtains open, no heat comes in from the sun. But now that it's summer time, I do feel "some" heat from the sun but it's nothing to complain about. Jerry did a great job. He had no idea what he was in for when he reviewed the job. We had 9 windows and the slider door replaced. The only mishap there was a long gash on the dining room windowsill which can be filled, sanded, and repainted. Oh and come to find out, evidently when Jeremy gave us the estimate for the windows, they had trim all around them. But when the windows were delivered, none of them  had the trim. I guess with the stucco it wouldn't work with that type of trim. Thanks Jeremy for a big disappointment in that area because I only chose those windows (style) because of the trim. At the same time, we decided to have some siding removed and replaced with stucco to match the rest of the house. When they removed our back security light, they broke it, so we had to buy a new one. They didn't rehang the cable wires the way we had them, even after I showed him how I wanted it done, they did it their way which now leaves an eyesore at the front entrance.  We decided to get a new screen door and a new porch light to match the rest of our new looking home. Overall we are pleased with the work. Our home looks so much nicer outside and inside. The stucco color was matched perfectly AND to make it up to us with the little mishaps here and there, they offered to apply a coat of stucco around the whole house! They offered us a choice of texture and we chose the small style. What a difference! We just love it. They ALSO replaced all the drain spouts without cost to us AND they painted them too to match the house. I have to say that I really enjoyed getting to know the guys and gals at Reliable. They are funny and friendly, like family. I would recommend them to anyone and we will consider them for future projects. We got great deals on every job. Totally satisfied. THANKS RELIABLE!</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

This review will be updated as work progresses. Background story - we found water stains on our ceiling a few weeks ago when we brought home the Christmas tree. We knew it was not good and had to get a contractor out asap. We called Reliable based upon all the reviews and luckily received a same day appointment with Joe M (J6).

Joe arrived promptly at 11 and greeted us with his friendly smile and overall great personality.  We discussed with him our needs and as we went along he provided background knowledge and expectations.  Sadly since we have tile that Reliable does not work with, we would have to go with a different contractor for the roof. We still however needed the drywall and any other issues in the attic addressed.

Somehow we got a little off track doing all the chatting with him, sharing similar family stories etc., And mentioned we wanted a bathroom remodel. Joe asked us for our thoughts, showed similar photos that could resemble what we were thinking and added some input which was very helpful. While we talked, he explained how Reliable handled their business and their would make sure they met our every need.

So now we having our Master Bath updated and the drywall repair handled for a price that will match the quality of work promised and expected. Joe couldn't have made such a perfect first impression of this company. We look forward to working with Joe M. Many many more times in the future.< /text>

<review>We had a 16 X 20 foot concrete slab poured by Reliable. The man that came out and did our estimate for the work was very professional and very kind. He explained everything that we needed to know about concrete. As soon as the rain stopped, we were contacted that they were ready to come out and begin the project. The workers were very clean, neat and speedy. They made short work of digging out the area where the slab was going to be poured. It rained the next day so they came to pour the concrete the day after. They were here all day long to pour and then to caress the concrete into a beautiful slab. They gave us full instructions on how to care for the concrete until we were ready to use it for our outbuildings. We had two follow-ups by their management before the final inspection. The grade on our slab was probably 12 to 15 in below the surface of the surrounding grass. They followed up by correcting the slope of the yard away from the house, and then putting 2 to 3 in river rock around the slab. It is truly beautiful. I would absolutely recommend Reliable to do almost any project that falls under their ability to do.< /review><Time>1554931495930</Time>< Name>

<Review>Our family worked with these guys for 5 year's. They fixed 5 of our properties in total. They bacame almost like family, being our go to for anything. When we were looking for solor for our home they pushed the PACE program through ygreen. We were told adding solor to our home would add value to our home, and once we sold our home the loan would go with the home. We would not have to pay it off first. Then we got a letter stating our house was now under a lien. After reaching out to reliable we were told that was normal and the lien would be removed once work was finished. But it never was, 2 years later reliable told us they stopped working with ygreen because they were getting similar complaints about this. The original cost was 40grand to be paid down over 20 years. We are trying to sell our home, but cannot do so until the solor is completely paid off. The bill is now 53 grand!!! We are losing that in escrow, reliable reaction to the 53grand was " right on"?? They gave us horrid advice, after we had payed around 300000 to them over the years for work. Now we are stuck losing money on our home, there was never even an apology for screwing us. This is a multi million dollar company that pretends to care. They offered to buy our home, but only if we payed the solor off ourself!!! Really, they are less then human. They don't care what happens to clients. We are so deeply hurt over this. Yes we are reaching out to an lawyer to figure out repercussions. Watch out they are snakes in the grass waiting to prey on anyone.<//Review>< Pics>

The company kept us informed, in advance, regarding starting date—weather was an issue—and began the project at the time promised. The workers came prepared and were organized. Their supervisors were available for questions throughout the process and responded quickly to concerns—mostly our interests in the process. After the work was completed, in this case a 100 ft stamped concrete retaining wall, cleanup was thorough. We have already hired them for our next project—waterless grass

I can't say enough good things about the professionalism of this company. I have had a great experience with every person I have talked to. Joe in particular has been amazing. He quickly responds when I reach out to him and is so patient with my many questions. The work this company has done on our home is high quality and carefully done. We get so many compliments from friends and neighbors! I often recommend this company and will continue to do so. Keep up the great work Reliable!!</text>

Joe the salesperson was knowledgeable, honest, prompt, and courteous, and was available to answer all questions and concerns that I had. He was also upfront about projects that weren’t a good fit for Reliable.
The work done has seemed to stand up, and it was done in a timely manner. The Reliable foreman and all the subcontractors did a good job, and clean med up everything when done. No only complaint would be the amount of debris inside my garage after the roof removal- I knew that there would be some debris, but I was surprised by how much, and I’d have preferred that some of my items in the garage had been covered. In all fairness however, there were actually 3 roofs to be removed instead of just two. But all in all, I’m very satisfied with the sales team and satisfied with the work done. I would consider using Reliable for future work, and I would recommend them to friends and family.<//text>

As clients with doctorates in business administration and teaching credentials, my family and I share our admiration and appreciation for the quality services provided by Reliable Home Improvement. From Jesse in sales, Jerry the installer, and owner Sean, we received excellent information, scheduling, professional window installation, after-care and support. This is truly thoroughly experienced, reliable and high-quality operation. Kudos to them. We will definitely contact them for additional projects. The Windows are beautiful!< /Text>

First class job. Driveway looks great. Crew was friendly, knowledgeable, and conscientious. David Dudley did a great job of setting everything in motion...giving several options.

From start to finish, we were kept up to date on when and who would be here to do the work.  We had 11 can lights installed in several rooms.  Our kitchen received six lights to replace our old fluorescent ones that were recessed in the ceiling.

They removed the old lights and then professionally framed in the new can lights.  After a fresh coat of paint was applied on the trim and box, the ceiling was painted and all access holes were patched and painted to match existing wall color.

New popcorn ceiling was patched and the color matched perfectly,  We had great follow up from Wes, the coordinator, and Fred the final auditor.  Fred and I went through the checklist to make sure we were happy.  It was a rainy day and I noticed that one of our windows had a leak.

I asked Fred to look at it and he told me that he would send a worker out to make sure the leak was not from any work they did (They had to run new wiring in the attic to power the new lights).  As promised, their worker came here in less than 24 hours and looked at the leak.

He discovered that the trim around the window had a crack and needed calking.  He offered to calk it for me but I still needed to get calk and told him I can take care of it.

This company did an excellent job and upon leaving for the day and at the end of the job, they picked up and cleaned any mess they made.  We would use them again and are very happy with the end result.  We highly recommend Reliable Home Inc. for any project you may have.  You owe it to yourself to at least give them a call to get an honest estimate.<//Text>

<Review>We met with reliable and Tim V came out to help us. We needed a retaining wall replaced because the hillside was caving in. Reliable did a fantastic job! With all the permitting, reliable kept us informed and the project on track. We have a beautiful engineered retaining wall with a stamped finish. Reliable was clean! You also had great followup and Joe and Dave are great guys as well. Thank you!<//Review>< Pics>

Reliable installed a new insulated garage door, gutters and painted the front of my house.  Joe S. was wonderful and attentive to our needs. We initially only wanted to get the dry rot work done but when they started the project Gabe and his carpenters were so good we decided to let Reliable do the painting as well. We are very pleased with the work we had done! Thank you so much!< /review>

<Review>I had my entire house of Windows, a new Owens Corning roof, stucco done to one wall of my house. I also had exterior paint job, and interior paint job of four different rooms and two bathrooms all done by Reliable. Great workmanship, fantastic workers provided excellent customer service, answered all of my questions throughout all of the phases and we're very patient. They went above and beyond for me and  installed two hand rails and two small steps to make it easier to access my front door. Thank you to Joe, Shawn and all the crews that worked on my house.  I was impressed that throughout the process the project coordinator and owners of the company stopped by many times to make sure I was 100% satisfied. It was very reassuring knowing that they were here for me whenever I needed them.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>We have used Reliable Home Improvement for three projects now.  The first one was a small emergency job but they responded immediately and treated it just like it was a big project for a repeat customer.  They did such a great job it was an easy decision to have them do more work when we needed it.  They really move things along quickly always checking to make sure the work is as we discussed.  We have had work done by others that we were not happy with and despaired of finding a company we could rely on. Now, we are so happy to know Reliable will be there to help with our list of projects.  The entire crew have been wonderful; responsive, courteous and knowledgeable. We would like to give a shout out to Greg P. and Gabriel G., all the great field crew and the wonderful office staff.

Reliable Home Improvement recently replaced the siding on our house. Our house looks BEAUTIFUL!!! The whole process from start to finish was positive and easy. Our Senior Design Consultant Joe was so patient, meticulous, and helpful in deciding our color and siding options. He set the tone for our Reliable experience!  The team of Alex, Denis, and Yuriy who installed our siding worked so hard with great attention to detail and were constantly checking in to make sure we were happy with the progress. Everyone we worked with was very professional and attentive. I highly recommend Reliable Home Improvement for your next home improvement project.< /review>

We have used reliable home improvement three times to update renovate our home the results were exceptional the work was done as promised and on schedule. Sometimes actually ahead of schedule The workmen were professional and skilled at their trades. When they were done the area was left clean you wouldn’t know they had even been there except for the improvements they made. It was a pleasure dealing with Tim Cliff and even one of the owners Sean stop by we would absolutely recommend a reliable home-improvement to anybody who is considering some home improvements to their home.< /Review>

We had an A+++ experience with Reliable Home Improvement. They remodeled our bathroom which required a complete demolition and rebuild including replumbing. Cliff, the sales person,  gave us accurate information  and helped us find a way to finance the project that worked for us. Laura, the project manager help us find the design elements we were looking for by recommending vendors who had productsthat matched our ideas of what we wanted. Laura always returned phone calls quickly and she answered our questions.  Sergiy did most of the work.  He can best be described as a craftsman. He has exceptional skills in all areas required in a remodel. Gary, who did several finish tasks, did excellent work also. This company is a group of professionals who work together to provide an excellent product.<//Text>

Working with Reliable I met with Joe S. for some window work. They are very honest and upfront and fair with their pricing. I appreciate working with Joe and Reliable. I would give 5 stars, but none of us are perfect! I recommend Reliable to anyone who encounters them.<//text>

I met with Joe M at the beginning of the month, me and my wife were waiting for our refinance to go through before we pull the trigger on a new roof. Since we’ve met reliable we’ve had three other bids and I want to thank reliable for not pressuring us as well as providing excellent information on a Owens Corning roofing system. Thanks again Joe M.< /Text>

We originally hired Reliable to replace our existing fence, remove some foliage and grade a large portion of the backyard. We were more than impressed with the sales staff and crew. They did great work on the fence and backyard and are a company that goes above and beyond the normal scope of work you would expect from any other company. After the first job we decided we wanted to extend our RV port (install a square concrete slab) and knew exactly who to call. Again Reliable did a great job and made sure we were happy with the outcome before signing off on the job. We had Reliable out for a third time when we decided to put in new windows, new sliding glass door and a patio cover. Reliable did a great job and not only painted the new stucco around our windows but the entire wall as well! As everyone knows issues do arise in construction and Reliable was always happy to correct any errors and make sure the job was done to our satisfaction.  I would definitely highly recommend this company to anyone who needs any home improvement work done.< /review>

We love our windows so much we are getting more for the rest of the house! The approval and installation process was easy. Jesse and the reliable team answered all our questions, stayed in contact between signing papers and installation, and were on time for each day of the project. We have noticed a significant change in noise and heat in the house on top of the windows just looking better. Looking forward to doing more house projects with Reliable!</Review>

We just had turf put in our backyard today and we absolutely love it! The quality of the turf Reliable has to offer is great and looks very natural! It's really soft and from what we read, it has a cooling technology so it doesn't get super hot in the summer! Perfect for our son! It was installed in one day too so that was awesome! Safe to say, we're very happy with our service we received from Reliable Home Improvements!< /review>

We had the most amazing experience with Reliable Home Improvement. They first installed flooring in on a newly purchased house then remodeled our kitchen. Honestly both were completed on time and look even better than expected. They are friendly, professional and RELIABLE in every way. I recommend to all our friends.< /Review>

<Text>Just want to leave this as a positive review because of Tim whom is a marine veteran, is an amazing salesman who follows the core values of what I think Reliable should be and what can be.  However, leadership is horrible the GM whom decided to come to our home and do final arrangements and measurements totally ruined our experience and trust with reliable.  If you are planning on doing something simple, small, in the sub $5000 range and have your decorations and ideas already mapped out then Reliable is good for you.  However, if you are looking for design help/assistance and more ideas brought upon unfortunately the GM will tell you that can’t be done “we have to do what is in their inventory.”  Or you have to go shop on your own with the budget in your quote.  Ummm we are spending almost 40k we can get an Audi S5 for that price.  Moreover, customer service skills massively lack or are missing with leadership and understanding of someone whom is battling cancer recovery and was in the hospital for about 7 months straight and mentioning a couple days of family needs in the hospital and laughing at us saying he needs to get to his wife like it’s the end of the world. Now our family and anyone who is looking for help in that regard shouldn’t look for this company as you will get laughed at like you are a peasant. On top of that had the audacity to reference getting water on demand when asked upon while leaving lab/infusion appointment while our caregiver was at the house was a little disturbing. Furthermore we couldn’t deal with the stress so had to end soon upon ending the GM decided to tell our son (5 year old) to pick up tiles that was left on the floor, multiple sample decorations.  Unfortunately, this GM ruined our perception of this great company that Tim has, which is an amazing vision and ideas that in my career path would match what would coincide with any company.

I’ll leave this here Tim got us to sign a contract on the upwards of 35-37k and it was smashed with leadership.  Home Depot can do the same for almost 27k with real wood not laminate and carpet,  leadership needs to stop penny pinching and really care for its staff, because yes I miss working with Tim.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

We just had reliable home-improvement install a brand new heating and cooling system in our home. We could not be happier with the results. They were on time finish the job quickly and correctly. Want to send a special thanks out to Cliff for getting the paperwork all put together and the install crew for being so polite and courteous. We strongly recommend reliable home improvement to anyone.<//text>

<Review>Had Reliable Home Improvement installed a concrete driveway they did a fantastic job. I had them back out and did a roof. This is a large roof with the 50-year warranty. Everything as promised totally awesome proof is in the pudding, got to see it to believe it I can't say enough. Joe M is great he brought me cookies multiple times at Christmas time. Joe M envisioned my concerns when it came to my sidewalk and driveway.  I have a difficult time entering and exiting my house with my bicycle.  He put nice curves and widened the sidewalk knowing that would help me.  Again I can't say enough all the crews that were out, here everybody knew exactly what Joe and I had talked about prior . It's almost like they were here when we signed the original contract.  Thanks again Reliable I'll have you out again! They were a pleasure to work with, thank you very much Reliable!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I want to say thank you to Reliable Home Improvement they came out and did my driveway and Patio in my front yard. I absolutely love it, they were in and out of here in 2 days. They cleaned up everything, they answered all of my questions.  Starting from the gentleman who knocked on my door to the sales consultant that came to my house his name was Joe. He was very informative and made it affordable for me. Again thank you very much Reliable Home Improvement I look forward to working with you in the future and I will pass your information along to my friends and family.</Text>

I originally found Reliable Home Improvement from a referral from my sister.  She had Reliable remodel her bathrooms and they did an excellent job.
I started a project of adding new windows to my home.  I called Reliable, they answered all of my questions in  a quick and professional manner.  I had them come out and check out which windows they recommended that I replace.  We agreed on all counts.  Their pricing is very competitive.  I ordered the windows, which were delivered on schedule. The installation of the windows was efficient and  quick.  The appearance of all windows are excellent!  I trust this company, if you have any questions from a client of theirs please contact their office for my phone number. Ask for Tim A. to come out to survey your project.</Text>

I had my roof done by Reliable about 2 years ago and my wife and I are still very thrilled. We had wood shake and we knew it needed to be replaced. My daughter referred me to Reliable and Tim Azevedo came out to take measurements and give me a quote. The installation went well and I do not have to worry about my roof anymore. Thank you to everyone at Reliable.< /text>

Sales staff was excellent Tim and Cliff were very helpful with no pressure, everything in the paperwork was understandable. Second measure for our Windows were right on time as promised as well as the install. He said it would be done in a day and a half and he was able to finish our house of Windows in one day from 830am to 4pm. I love the Windows especially my slider with the upgraded lock. My husband and I are very happy customers.</Review>

Reliable home improvement came out and did my gutters. We had experience with other companies in the past that wouldn’t call us back or be timely. Reliable was just that, Reliable! Chris M and Joe S came out and found a great solution to my gutter problem. Joe their gutter installer was timely, communicated and even fixed issues while he was working. The gutters are great!

<Review>My wife and I just had Reliable Home Improvement come out and install insulated siding on the front of our home and we could not be  Happier. I've worked with Professional companies before but Reliable out did themselves. Starting with Cliff getting the paperwork in order then to Gabe and his production crew and even Sean stopping in from time to time was a nice touch as he is one of the owners. We really felt like Reliable cared about us. We will be using reliable again in the future.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

We recently hired Reliable Home Improvement after meeting with Cliff. Cliff not only sold us on the project he followed up after the work was done to make sure we were happy. The concrete driveway extension and pad for our gazebo exceeded our expectations. Customer service from beginning to end made the project go smoothly and we would definitely use Reliable for future projects.<//text>

I have a friend that had work done by Reliable and so I had Reliable come and look at my kitchen in my rental. I was under a deadline and needed it done within 30 days. I was so impressed that they were able to come in and do my counters in my kitchen, two of my bathrooms and LED lighting all within the time frame I was looking for. What also impressed me was their expertise, knowledge and advice on where I should have my can lights placed. I am very pleased with the work and would definitely use them in the future.< /text>

There were a couple challenges with the project, but production smoothed them out for me. Everyone was great, the project was installed in a timely fashion and I am excited to get the paint project started! Thanks Reliable.</Review>< Date>

< Review>
The roof was replaced with a lifetime warranty.  It looks beautiful,  I have had contact with 11 different people in person (including two crews and the city's inspector)  and two others by phone.  Everyone has made me feel comfortable.  I was appraised of the schedule before, during and after the roof was completed.</Review>

<Text>I have had Reliable come out and do work on my home on several occasions over the years.  It started with roofing, then we did dry rot repair, then we had windows changed out, then they did my gutters, and just now I signed up to have the house painted. They use high quality products installed right.  The guys are very professional and very polite and curteous, they clean up after themselves which is very important.  I look forward to working with them again.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Joe came out to our home about a paint job. He represented Reliable very well. Clean, professional and was very informative. He showed us your insurance and licensing and numerous jobs in the area you have completed. When we are ready to move forward with the paint project it will definitely be with Reliable Home Improvement!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

The fact they are a local family owned business makes us feel very comfortable doing business with them. They offer a wide variety of financial options which was incredibly helpful for us and very affordable. I would recommend them to anyone looking to improve their home as they offer many services, big and small.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Our project manager, Gabe was great to work with. He stopped by to check in on the project almost every day and was very responsive to phone calls and emails. Russell's crew did the siding and door install and were awesome!  They kept the property clean while they worked and were very patient with my constant questions and inspections.

I have to share the experience that I had with Reliable Home Improvement. This is my fourth estimate I've had they are not the cheapest and they're not the most expensive, however I promise you they are the most professional and informative out of all of the estimates I've gotten. I'm looking at doing my bathroom remodels. Currently my husband and I are refinancing but I just had to share the experience I had with Joe.  I have a lot of time invested meeting all four of these companies that I have had out here to my house. I have three children and I'm very busy. Reliable showed up early to the appointment they were very respectful to my time and the questions I had, he had all the answers.  Again, I'm just sharing my experience because the other three companies were very unprofessional and were pushy trying to get the deal when the fact of the matter is we are refinancing and we can't do anything at this time. I look forward to working with Reliable and I just want to say thank you!</Text>

Reliable did a fair amount of concrete work to replace sidewalk and patio in back yard, and to add a large raised bed, also in the back yard.  Work was done professionally and well worked out.  All questions were answered and the work came up to my specifications as well as theirs.  Workmen were prompt, friendly and courteous.  Greg Palmer was the design consultant who worked with me so the plans were what I wanted and what they could and did deliver.  People always ready to answer questions regarding the progress of the job.  A pleasure to work with this company.</Review>

Reliable Home Improvement is a company you can trust for all your home improvement needs.They did several jobs for me, and I am thrilled with the work that was done.  Not only was the work outstanding, but they also left each area where they worked spotless; removed all left over materials, sawdust, etc. Also everyone that I dealt with was not only professional, respectful and courteous, but also prompt in doing the work when they said they would do it.  I will use them again when I need other home improvement projects in the future.</Review>

We had the best experience with reliable. We obtained 4 quotes and reliable was in the middle for those quotes. When we received our quote from reliable Tim came over and was very personable and answered all of our questions. We plan to use them in the near future to get our pool cement redone. I would highly recommend them.</Review>

We wanted a patio cover as well but weren't sure what we were looking for exactly.  Chris McCarthy helped talk us through what we needed and made us feel confident about our choices. The guys doing the tear-down, pouring, and installation (different teams) were all AMAZING. I can't say enough how professional and great each team was. They communicated with us the WHOLE WAY. I always knew what was happening, and was shown progress the whole time. The Project Manager, Patrick, was there all the way. He made sure everything was being done right, and checked in with us the whole time. We will be using them again.</Text>< pictures>

The turf they installed is beautiful and has held up perfectly even with my very active border collie mix running and sliding around on it. The project was completed faster than I expected and worked around my crazy life schedule. They went above and beyond to offer advice on other pieces of the backyard remodel I was doing myself, let me borrow a tool or two, and even helped unload pavers from my car on their lunch break. Jeremy, Patrick, and Chris were all the best to work with and I’d use them again anytime.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Well what can I say I shopped around did some homework even went to a bunch of Home Shows to find the Right Company.

Made appointment to have Reliable come out and explain our options on replacement windows & pricing

Followed up by measurement appointment

They were on time the day of the appointment for window measuring.

Windows ordered.

New windows arrived and date setup for install.

Day of install went great. Replacement windows installed old windows hauled away and area cleaned up.

What else can I say, everything went SMOOTH we like the new windows. I can now longer hear my neighbors pool pump running all night and his damn dog barking all night I can now finally get to sleep and yes the new windows are sweet.

Thank You RELIABLE !< /Text>

<Text>We had a great experience working with reliable. Quite frankly we didn't know what to expect as our house had not been painted for over 20 years and there were issues with dry rot.  The Reliable team of Jeff, Gabe, Sean and their support team really came through.

Painting your house is a major long-term investment so we wanted to make sure that we got the most value for our money.  With Reliable we received the the full package --speed, reliability, accuracy -- all delivered with the highest quality.  Including a job change we made to repair siding after the job had started.

This is the place you live there is no point in skimping on something now so that you have to pay twice as much later.  We rate Reliable a 5-star<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I started with a contract for a new roof and was impressed with the workmanship and how it was completed in a timely manner. I decided then to discuss installing a patio and concrete work around the backyard which included a portion of synthetic grass. These projects were finished on time to my complete satisfaction and agreed price. The work was completed two years ago and it looks as good as the day they finished. I’ve had no problems. I normally do not give recommendations but I was impressed with reliable’s work. Thank you Tim Azevedo and the rest of Reliable.< /text>

<text>We recently had our master bedroom and bathroom remodeled by Reliable and the finished job far exceeded our expectations. Additionally, they did a significant upgrade of our concrete patio. Reliable’s quality and professionalism can not be beat. Our next project will definitely be done by Reliable Home Improvement.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I have had 3 jobs done by Reliable and have been 100% pleased each time. The work was quick, efficient, and professional. The consultants and workers were all easy to work with. I will definitely use Reliable again for other projects.< /review>

<response>None</response><review>These guys are awesome! One of the guys stopped by to make sure that Reliable’s trucks weren’t blocking our driveway and that there wasn’t any debris from the job they had going on next door. I was amazed at the professionalism and that they took the time to come by my house even though they weren’t working on ours. We are not in a position to do any home improvements as of now, but when we do Reliable will be the first company we call.</review><date>1533135363657< /date><username>kathleen kammerer<//username><GmapID>0x809adfbeb7eebb17:0xcf9c940ad9e667f8</GmapID>< Pics>

<Text>The work on my house was done very well and very professionally.   I had a lot of dry rot around the house that was repaired then repainted beautifully to match the rest of the house. I do recommend their work to anyone who is in need of repairs.
Thank you Reliable.

<Review>We had Reliable do interior painting in our home and couldn't be more thrilled with the outcome.  Starting with our painter, Jeremy, who went above and beyond the call of duty!  He painted things that weren't in our contract, because he couldn't stand around and do nothing while something else was drying.  I give Reliable a special thanks for having someone like Jeremy on their staff.< /Review>< rate>

Ryan and the crews from reliable have worked on four different houses in our family and over ten projects. From solar to backyards to home renovations to doors and sliders and cabinets; they will provide the best craftsmen to complete your job to perfection!  They will work with you and respect all of your ideas to make your dream home. I know mine is now and so is my other family members homes in the area. Thank you.< /Text>

<text>I am very pleased with the work Reliable did for me.  I needed the front gutter and front and side walkway replaced.  They made excellent suggestions for small changes which made the walkways much more pleasing and matched them to the existing driveway.  I am very happy with the way the jobs turned out.<//text>< Pictures>

We just bought a house and it had some old style double pane windows. Reliable came out and installed new Anlin double pane windows. So much heat has been kept out since the new windows have been put it. Customer service is tremendous. Will have more work done with them! Thank you for everything!< /Review>

I first became aware of Reliable Home Improvement while attending the Auburn Home Improvement Show.  Their estimates were reasonable (not cheap) but their work was excellent. The young man who came to our house to paint (Jeremy) was meticulous in detail, thorough, and always cleaned up each night. I would recommend RHI to anyone who is looking for a quality paint job and wants to deal with professionals..</text>

<Text>Jermey assisted me with putting in my order of a new sliding glass door! He is very professional and nice to work with. He also recommended the pet door that my dog DJ will be enjoying and will give me peace of mind that I can leave my home secure and my dog still can go in and out as he pleases. I would high recommend him and Relaible for all my home improvements.
Thank you Jeremy!

<review>I had a disappointing experience with Reliable. While they have lots of staff, everybody friendly, and the work was done quickly, the end result was unflat concrete which doesn't drain well and ponds and has a mottled look; they damaged older concrete which was never repaired or otherwise addressed and a failure to blend the concrete color as I had requested. The finish a few years on is deteriorating, with no apparent remedy. I've had them out a few times, but they have only been willing to do the minimum to address my post-sale concerns. $19K I wish was never spent with this outfit. Shop around, look at older examples of their work, not just recent work.<//review></record></dataset><record>

If I could give no stars I would. I paid 8k for a retaining wall that was not set up according to function. The drainage in my yard was messed with so terribly that the wall they built sits in water year round. They left hundreds of nails sitting in my yard and told me they would come back and break up rock and never did. I regret ever letting this company come to my home to even do a bid! They have created so much fix up work with the thousands I have already paid. So incredibly disappointing!</review>

<Review>Let's start with my meeting John, he works marketing for Reliable and he came to my house and kindly without pressure offered me a pamplet and explained what this company offers. I liked him immediately and felt comfortabe talking with him. In steps Joe M., a sales consultant for Reliable. Talk about an honest, upbeat kinda guy. We talked and he measured and came up with a reasonable dollar amount to have my dream patio put in. Long story short. Reliable is honest, they do fantastic work, and they have great communication with each other, but more importantly with their customers. I LOVE MY PATIO! I know I recieved the best deal and best quality. I'm  sincere about this. They worked with me to make it affordable. I sit outside every morning and have a cup of coffee. This patio is in my front yard. I have met so many neighbors I had never met before. All is good in the neighborhood.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Reliable Home Improvement did and excellent job in repairing the sun/dry rot that curled up the lower edge of the second story plywood sheathing of our house.  The two faux beams on the front of the house were replaced and the exposed stucco was replaced, matching the present form and color. The soffits were professionally replaced like new. The upper damaged plywood was replaced, cleaned and painted the same color as the house. The coordinator of the work crew was most professional in his contact with us to alert us to the arrival of the work crew and the delivery of materials. The workers of the different section of the work order, we well mannered, on time, and communicated to us the progress of the work. All in all, Reliable Home Improvement did an exceptional job in the many areas of the required work. We would be most happy to recommend Reliable Home to any and everyone that needs a great company to do any type of work around their house. Lloyd Pearson.</review>

<Text>Reliable just completed landscaping our totally barren and neglected back yard. This is our second project with Reliable, having done our front landscape two years ago. The experience and results from that project made it a no-brainer to sign them up again. Tim Azevedo, our Design Consultant from the front-yard project kept in touch with us, knowing that we'd eventually want to landscape the rear yard. When Tim presented us their project proposal, we didn't bother to consider other contractors. Patrick Bedford returned as our Project Manager, and our Reliable team was back in place.

Tim drafted his original design and worked diligently with us to refine features until we had our desired design. As the crew started the initial construction, we came up with a few "tweaks", some required the crew to undo/redo some work. Patrick and the entire Reliable team worked with us, never made an issue over our last-minute changes, and completed
everything that we asked for.

The result is a back yard that is nothing short of a dream! The tinted, stamped, and sealed concrete is spectacular; the poured-concrete curved bench in the back corner makes the ideal setting for a fire pit. The two turf areas punctuate the concrete, giving the space an oasis-like appearance. The custom patio cover completes the space and enhances our house's rear elevation.

There isn't a single spot of this job that we would change. Tim, Patrick, and the entire Reliable team made it two-for-two on our landscaping. We're so happy that we just signed up for the third, and last, piece: driveway and front sidewalk/porch to match the rear yard concrete.<//Text><user>103203298795144397760</user>< gmap_id>

I was disappointed when I requested an estimate from Reliable Home Improvement.  To start off the estimator did not even get on my roof, but stood on the ladder and evaluated what needed to be done from there.  Then he said he could measure it from the ground instead of on the roof.  The finally straw was he said they had a minimum they had to charge and my roof was small and only needed like two squares, but he had to charge me for five squares which added over $3000 more than any other estimates I had received.  There is no way I would ever deal with this company again.  I was going to give them a chance to bid on a patio cover and cement replacement of a sidewalk I needed done, but I think they are way too expensive for me.</Text>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>I had the 25 yr old siding removed from my home, repaired and sealed the old stucco, retextured the stucco and then had it covered with Coolwall energy efficient coatings.  My home looks brand new and we cannot wait to continue the next project.  From Greg in sales to Gabe as my project manager, the entire team worked to make my project a huge success.

Update:  I have had some quality problems in both jobs that were performed at my home.  Reliable has been very responsive, but some things you just can't fix and others I will be stuck with after the 5 year warranty runs out.  They don't appear to self perform any work and I think they need to work on their contractor oversight a bit and be sure that the jobs are being done right, and not just being done such as not filling stucco holes with caulking and not painting in weather so wet that the primer won't dry before the paint goes on.</Review>< pictures>

We hired Reliable Home Improvement (RHI) to re-landscape our front yard into a Sonoran desert theme with desert plants we bought from a southern California nursery. Let me tell you, RHI’s landscaping crew created a horticultural masterpiece. To say they did an outstanding job is an understatement. We get compliments from our neighbors. Victor and his crew are hard workers, they rock, and they got the job done excellently. They installed a sophisticated drainage system and replicated desert soil conditions to help the plants become established. They also installed a new drip system. I highly recommend RHI if you want a landscaping company that will be attentive to any and all details you want in your project.< /review>

<Text>Absolutely superior experience from beginning to end.  I found Reliable at the Auburn Home Show and liked what I heard.  We made an appointment and the sales person confirmed and was here on time.  He spent time appraising my roof and came up with an estimate.  I'll be honest that it was more than I had expected, but I realize I know nothing about roofing so had to take his word for it that that was the cost. He explained the quality of their products and what set them apart and that made sense to me.  My roof already had two layers so had to be completely removed before the new tiles were installed.

We scheduled a start date, but, of course, mother nature had other ideas.  We had rain and it ended up starting a month later.  Everyone involved communicated with me and kept me informed.  The people working on the roof went straight to work and did their jobs.  What more could I ask!

Jeffrey Jamison was the roofer.  He worked alone and finished the job in three days.  What a hard worker!  He took time with me to reassure me that I had chosen a quality company and a quality product.  He even helped me re-attach my garage door opener when I had to open my door manually.  He couln't have been nicer and was a pleasure to have working on my home.

The supervisors, Patrick Bedford and Bill Ridings, were in touch by phone and in person before, during and after the project.  I would use their services with no hesitation for other projects.  It was a painless, easy, satisfying experience.

My only "regret" is that I didn't choose a color that was dramatically different from my old one so that my neighbors would notice my gorgeous new roof!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Let me tell you why I didn’t go with reliable. It all starts with Tim! At the time I wasn’t able to voice how I was feeling but even after a month now it still bothers me how pushy he was. No means no, but not to Tim, he will keep pushing and pushing. He came to give a quote with his partner. His partner came 3 minutes late, which I didn’t care about at all but Tim had to throw his partner under the bus mentioning it to several times throughout the “estimate”. (I put quotations because it was mainly him berating my fiancée and I the entire time). It is not professional to throw your co-worker under the bus in front of customers, it’s just bad business. First, he took over two hours just to give me an estimate which was extremely unreasonable($4717 I immediately said that was too much so he lowered it to $3497). He badgered and badgered me. I kept telling him I had to think about it and finish getting other estimates. He then proceeded to tell me to sign now and to cancel my other appts. I said I needed time to think about it he said he’d wait in the car and give me a couple minutes. What kind of time is that?! He finally lowered the price to $2665 only because I said I’d pay in full which still was more than I ended up paying with another company. He said several times that I will not find 26 gauge steel anywhere, that they are the only ones to have it. He said I won’t find the quality anywhere. Glad I didn’t cancel my other gutter estimates since I found 26 gauge steel gutters powder coated to the color I chose and the downspouts. All for a fraction of what Tim quoted. I paid $1584 thanks to All About Gutters, I highly recommend their professional and excellent customer service and great prices, not to mention they look great! I’ve been getting complements from all my neighbors, people even stopped to get the company info. It also didn’t take 2hours for an estimate like Tim did. Estimate from All About Gutters took about 20 thorough minutes and I think my actual gutters were installed in a shorter amount of time than Tim took to give the estimate. Just shows the experience some companies have.

The main reason why it still bothers me is because of how personal he took it calling me frugal and cheap and I’m just like all the other Filipino customers!!! What the heck does my ethnicity have to do with anything??? Please just check estimates all around so you don’t get ripped off by Tim and don’t let him bully you into signing like he tried with me.<//Text>

We have used Reliable for several things in our home. New windows throughout, interior and exterior electrical work, attic access and we just finished doing our entire backyard which included ripping up and repouring all of our concrete surfaces and adding a new firepit! They have been amazing on every project. Tim Azevedo is so helpful and knowledgeable! Patrick, Kelly and the owners, Shawn and Ryan are also such a pleasure to work with! The crews have always been efficient and very precise in the work they do. Everyone at Reliable is very responsive and have always strived to do their best and make us happy. We will use them for all of our house projects!</Text>

<Review>I am using Reliable to remodel my kitchen - new cabinets, counter, backslash, electrical and paint.  So far working with them has been so easy and they have accommodated me every step of the way.  Communication has been awesome and they have been really sticking to the tight schedule they set.  I know because they posted a schedule of what happens each week- it's on our fridge.

Hiccup 1 - our gas line needed to be redone from the meter.  No prob.  The contractor let me know right away what needed to be done and fixed it.

Hiccup 2 - they painted the wrong color on the wall.  OOPS!  No prob, they repainted it right away and even threw in a gallon of each paint color for touch-ups.  No pointing fingers, the contractor was very professional and assured me he would take care of it right away and he did.

Hiccup 3 - my son is sick.  No prob.  The contractor said he can definitely work around it and if we need no crew that day it is perfectly fine, we will still be on schedule.  He reminded me that it's my home  and that they will work around my schedule.  The designer even texted me first thing the next day to see if my son was feeling better and if it was ok to have a crew there that day.

Other things to note - I have 2 young kids.  The work area is ALWAYS clean when I come home.  It's also hard to meet before my kids go to bed but the team there was willing to meet with me after work hours to discuss the contract and design.  The materials they use are top quality.  Our cabinets are custom and solid wood with soft close drawers that close like butter.

Conclusion - I love them.  They will take care of you. Would I recommend them?  I already have.  Would I use them again?  They are starting my floors soon.</Review>< user_id>

<rate>3</rate><text>They repainted our house and did an excellent job with both the prep and the actual painting. They were very concerned with getting the job done right the first time. A little on the expensive side, but well worth it.

After I posted this review we called the Reliable folks over to do a small repair job, replace 1/2 sheet of dry wall, texture it and repair the flooring.  The flooring and dry wall were just slightly water damaged. They came over and inspected the wall and floor and found no rot or structural damage.  They said they could do the drywall - no problem but would have to check with their "floor guy" on the flooring repair.  They even offered to remove the drywall for free.  After 2 or 3 weeks we heard nothing from them about scheduling or anything.  I called the office and they sent a person out the next day to remove & replace the drywall.  He did fine but we had to wait to have another person come in to do the joint taping and texturing.  Another 2 or 3 weeks went by and I had to call again to get them to send a person to do the taping and texturing.  I then waited about 2 week more and called to ask when the flooring guy would be coming.  At the beginning they told me they were going to check with their "floor guy" Then, after more than a month, they told me they WERN'T GOING TO DO THE FLOORING!  I told them that I would have appreciated being informed of that much sooner so I could have someone else finish the job.

With all the delays and miscommunications on this little fix-up job I was very disappointed with the level of service I received.  I appreciate that there was no charge for the job, but nearly 2 months to do a job that could have been done in less than a few days!  It became very clear that Reliable is a great contractor to use if you have a big job, like $10,000 but if your job is small, they try to fit you in when their people have the time. And if they don't, GOOD LUCK.  Try someone else for small jobs around $1000 or less<//text>< Pics>

My two favorite things about this store are the printing department and the clearance aisle for sale items. I've switched all the printing of my brochures and advertising materials to this store because the printing department people are so helpful and do such a stellar job. There is an older woman who knows everything there is to know about paper (great guidance!). There is also a younger woman with dyed hair (Angela) who is my go-to person for printing. She has done a great job every single time I've gone in. I HIGHLY recommend this store for printing needs, especially if you have last-minute brochures or flyers to print and can't take the time to order online.<//Text>

Jon, Albert and Angela in the print center were amazing in helping my family with some pamphlets for my grandma’s service.

Highly recommend them for your printing needs. Customer service was great even as they were slammed on a weekend. Thanks all!< /review>

I had a rough experience at this store, which was still absolutely ridiculous and a complete pain in the you know what. However, their corporate reached out to me and finally refunded the $10 in 'authorization' fees their document printer had charged me and never returned itself.

So I've updated my rating from 1 star to 3 stars.<//Review>

I’ve had several large print jobs printed here. Mostly black-and-white copies. The last job that I had printed, the printing is barely acceptable. They needed a new toner cartridge and the copies are just dark enough that I am not going to take them back but I’m very disappointed in their work. Also, when I went in today they were five employees working and three people standing in line and it was unclear why we were just standing there. I waited a long time - like honestly 10 minutes I think. Anyway I think I’m going to start going to staples for my printing needs, at least the ink is dark and legible.</review>

My fiance and I visited this place a few weeks ago to print our wedding  save the dates. I wasn't completely happy with the outcome and they were more than happy to fix the problem. When trying to print word files as photos there's some maneuvering involved between the staff and my fiance they figured it out all with friendly service and professionalism.</text>

Awful store and company. Why are you not accepting returns? This was your store policy. It should only apply to purchases made AFTER you changed the policy.< /text>

<Review>normally buy basic supplies at Office Depot Thousand Oaks and I decided to try them for computer repair on my older HP desktop. After waiting 15-20 minutes for assistance the only technician in the store looked at my HP and stated it could be the motherboard but a system restore might fix the problem. I was quoted $100 for a system restore and guaranteed if it did not fix my problem I would receive a 50% credit. Seemed a reasonable risk. Picked up my HP a few days later and it worked great for 1-day and then completely shut down. Took the unit back and was told they are not equipped to diagnose hardware problems, been good to know earlier.
Let the unit for further diagnose with and was instructed to call them. Called Thursday and spoke with Nathan the store manager and after mentioning the 50% refund was told that's the first time I've ever heard of that. Nathan promised to check with the original technician and call me back Monday. Tuesday I called, Nathan was gone for the day. explained the whole issue to someone else and was promised another callback. Finally I did receive the 50% refund and promptly went to BestBuy and purchased a new computer due to Office Depot's complete lack of customer service to an existing customer in there store.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80e83abbb1dadbeb:0x4073bc577ad5251a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the worst location Office Depot has. They are very unhelpful and try their best to give you their 800 number so the location does not need to do their jobs. I called the 800 number and they told me my problem could be solved by the manager. However the manager named Patrick said the 800 number is not his boss. Patrick is the worst manager. I will never shop at office depot.< /Text>

I passed by Eric’s shop too many times before finally checking it out. When I did go in, he helped me navigate the various stacks. After describing the project I had in mind, he pointed out the right slab. I came back to get it the next day and started in on what became a very unique bar/liquor cabinet. A great local shop!</Text>

We drove up from San Francisco to snag some wood from Eric this weekend. It was the best experience! We needed to find wood for shelving and there was SO many beautiful choices. He helped us every step of the way, even to load them into our vehicle. So kind! Highly recommend stopping by!<//Review>

What an AMAZING experience!! Eric the owner of Live Edge Wood Slabs did a great job in showing me all kind of wood slabs and he has hundreds of the most beautiful slabs I’ve ever seen!
His kindness, patience and amazing wood slabs inventory  are what have made me to make a decision to purchase all the wood for my house here.  I also think its important to say that as a female who never dealt with wood, Eric went over every detail about the wood, and that alone deserves 5 stars.  If you have the desire to buy wood slabs for your  new project, Live Edge Wood Slabs is the place to go!!!< /text>

What a fantastic place and Eric is a great guy. Very helpful, easy going, knowledgeable and skilled, oh and he has a great selection of slabs at very reasonable prices. I brought a couple of unfinished redwood slabs last weekend for a shelving project, then returned the very next day for another!!! He was also happy to cut them down so I could get them in the car. I will be returning, that's for sure.<//review>

This was my first project turning a raw slab into a table - I'm so glad I found Eric.

He was there for me every step of the way from a nearly 1hr overview in person, to being incredibly responsive over the past few weeks through text as made my way through each phase of the project.

Erics pricing on the slabs were half the price of places nearby, and his partnership in the project was worth so much more.

It's clear that Eric is an expert, cares deeply about the craft, and is very welcoming and willing to go deep with beginners.

THANKS ERIC!< /text>

I bought a gorgeous slab of redwood from Eric today and could not be happier!
The possibilities are endless with the huge selection of Redwood, Walnut and Eucalyptus slabs. I found myself envisioning expansive conference tables, rustic shelves, and handsome bar counters.
Eric Christopher Art is a hidden treasure of a resource for builders, artists, DIYers and anyone searching for a unique piece of furniture.<//Review>

Eric is such a friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful man! My husband and I wanted to build our dining table with one of his slabs and we had no idea what we were doing. Eric took the time to help us pick the best sized slab for our space. Then once he knew we knew nothing, and looking at the slab we picked, he gave us a crash course on how to make it a piece of art/furniture. When we were driving away, we couldn't stop talking about how cool of a dude he is. We're so glad we saw his post on IG. We have plenty of family members who want to make a trip up to him (over 2 hours from us btw) so they can meet him and get started on their unique pieces.<//Text>

Eric is not only professional, this guy knows his slabs! He has a great selection of pieces to complete your custom build whether you are a private home diy-er, business, or contractor. We used our unique piece of redwood for a coffee table to bring a bit of California back home with us to Idaho.</Text>

<review>I went to Eric looking for a half piece of slab for a pop-out countertop in mine and my girlfriends tiny home on wheels. Not only was Eric incredible accommodating and professional, be he also genuinely cares about our project and wanting to help us turn our dream into a reality. He got us a great piece of a redwood for a great price and adding the finished piece to our tiny house was a great highlight during a dismal time. Since then, Eric and I follow each other on Instagram and keep up with each other’s work, give him a follow to see some killer stuff!!<//review>< Pictures>

Just driving around Sebastopol saw the wood slabs stopped In just time to catch Eric before he left for the mill. He gave me a quick run down on all the different sizes and shapes, kinds of wood slabs he has.So now I know what kind to get and what fits on the trailer and will call before I show up again cause he’s busy.< /Text>

<review>This was my first project turning a raw slab into a table - I'm so glad I found Eric.

He was there for me every step of the way from a nearly 1hr overview in person, to being incredibly responsive over the past few weeks through text as made my way through each phase of the project.

Erics pricing on the slabs were half the price of places nearby, and his partnership in the project was worth so much more.

It's clear that Eric is an expert, cares deeply about the craft, and is very welcoming and willing to go deep with beginners.

THANKS ERIC!</review>< userid>

Eric not only brings his extensive expertise but also a genuine passion for his wood product to his clientele. I recently purchased a slab of Claro Curly Walnut that is available in the No. California area. This distinct species is beautifully marbled, and its extraordinary beauty is unmatched! Eric generously shared these unique qualities of Claro Walnut with me and assured me that this would undoubtedly make a spectacular dining room table. And indeed it did! Crating the 9' slab went seamlessly and as it was carefully removed from the A-frame box it exceeded one's expectations!
To all in the architectural and design community, I highly recommend you source wood from Eric.

I bought a table from Eric Christopher after looking for a while. I wanted a unique piece made from a real wood craftsman to bring character and spice to my living room. That is exactly what I got. It is super well made from a beautiful thick redwood. It is very smooth on top showing the natural wood grains and swirling veins. A fantastic work Eric Christopher !</Text>

I just started taking a wood working class, and wanted to make a nice one. I contacted Eric about his small Walnut stock. I bought them and am happy with the product and price.  I live in SF, but it was worth the 1+ hour drive up to his shop/store to pick them up. When I do other small projects, I will def. call him for wood.</Text>

I commissioned Eric to make my family a massive outdoor table. When we first saw the finished results we couldn't believe our eyes, such a beautiful transformation. Guests are amazed when they come over for dinner. Eric was easy to work with and gave us a great price.</text>

<review>Eric came through for our organization on a project that we were having trouble getting finished elsewhere. Eric showed great attention to detail and, significantly, did what he said he would do when he said he would do it. He gave us a great finish on counters and tables. Everyone I've talked to in our organization is thrilled with the work product. We've now got another project in the works with Eric. Because why mess with success?< /review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Eric has been a dear friend to us since college and we've been drooling over his furniture for years. When we finally bought a home I called him before we even closed and got the keys. We wanted a table we were going to have for our life time and have room to gather all our friends and family around. Instead of picking something trendy and composite up at a box store we wanted a piece so beautiful it would never be donated or sold and would never go out of style. Eric spent weeks with us walking through the different options in wood, stain, seals and size. He analyzed videos of our new space and coloring and built us the most unreal 10' long live edge Redwood table re-purposed from here in the bay area. We are so happy with our table and excited to watch our family grow around it.< /review>

I’m a welder fabricator and had a client come to me with an idea of a slab table so I went to Eric to get the slab and have the finish work done. He delivered and met my every need on time. He has great attention to detail. I’ll be coming back in the future for a personal project.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I contacted Eric after seeing a Craigslist post for Claro Walnut blanks that he was selling (at an amazing price btw). He picked up my call right away, was very professional and amazingly his shop was open until 7pm which very few businesses are. I arrived at his shop and was immediately impressed by some of the tables and slabs that Eric had done or was working on. We struck up a conversation about some of the pieces he had created and I was very impressed by both the quality of his work and the price points of the pieces which were considerably low for the amount of work he put into it. Eric's fair and pay-it-forward mindset was very refreshing and unique and he actually threw in an additional 6 pieces of Walnut for free! Needless to say, I will definitely continue bringing my business to Eric in the future.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Was so impressed with her customer service. My second experience was picking up my first package and a man had to go to the back to get it. It was on the heavier side and he offered to help me to my car with it. Went above and beyond!

I have never met before such a rude post worker! The worst experience with post office ever. When I asked to cancel my payment because of weird extra charges, which I have never pay in others post services. He said: Oh really?! Looks like you're in a bad mood today! He mocked me. This behavior is unacceptable! I don’t understand why he hasn’t been fired yet.</Review>

As it was most likely a cash or gift card, it was probably the latter.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dc742f65d63fdb:0xbba4ec5b6e6ab705< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
This is how the mailman delivered our package from Macy's right now. I am shocked and furious. With people's packages being stolen from their front door's and mail being stolen from mailboxes now-a-days, you'd think that this would be the last place the mailman would put a package. Its almost as if he intentionally put it on top of the mailbox for someone to steal it.</Review>

<review>There's been a couple times now where I've had several packages set to get delivered on the same day and one of the packages gets delivered to my door(generally between eleven and two) while the other gets marked with "Delivery Exception, Animal Interference" and it's usually around 5:30~5:45 when they "attempt to deliver".  I don't have a dog and how can one box come right up to my front door but not the other!? Weather it's poor preparation and my packages aren't grouped or the mail carrier is inept. It's not acceptable to make excuses and lie to cover their own laziness. The office itself it nice enough and the workers are professional.</review>< pics>

My 4yr olds birthday card was tampered with and a wedding invitation. Holes where poked in the corners to obviously pull money out luckily they did not get it. this was done at the postal facility or by my mail carrier as I promptly picked up my mail as the carrier drove away from my mailbox. They also coincidentally returned a missing package of 7 days less than 2 hours after speaking with someone at their facility trying to convince us that this second package that has been missing was stolen. We refused to let them say it was stolen told them to figure out where it was, they said they would investigate further and less than 2 hours later a knock at our door with our package..... I will be reporting them. Mail tampering is illegal. Wish I could leave zero stars.< /Review>

I had a old check and the person threw it back and without looking at me said. "I ain't taking it." Well I ain't taking it either enjoy one star. You could be decent and just say "Its old you will have to bring a new one." that's nice enough even without saying Sir or please.</review>

< Review>
We were attempting to mail square marriage invitation envelopes. We went to the nearby post office on E Vista Way and were told there would be no additional postage requirement beyond a standard stamp. Seeking a second opinion, we brought the letters to this post office and were told that we would need the 70 cent stamps because these are of a size and shape that requires manual handling. So we purchased 100.

Then we return with the letters sealed and stamped with the 70 cent stamps and were told no, we will need the one dollar stamps.

Not only did we get separate answers at two different USPS branches, but we got two separate answers at the same USPS branch. This is really disappointing for something that should be easily defined based on weight and shape. Why could we not be given a truthful answer before spending $70 on stamps?< /Review>

I am not sure what's up with all the bad reviews. I've never had a bad experience. Even when the line was out the door, wait time has always been short for me and the staff has always been friendly.</Text>

Not sure about all the past reviews, but I had a great customer experience at this location. It was my first visit to this location. I was going to mail a big package and was confused of what label to use, what kind of shipping box to choose, etc. Then a lady among the staff noticing my confusion, stepped out from her counter and helped me personally until I got to the checkout counter. At the checkout, another lady greeted us with generous smile and explained all the shipping options and helped us choose the right one. I also noticed that the staff had a very good relationship with customers. All the staff were very helpful.

Businesses like these usually have very long and hectic days especially during holiday season. Please be patient with the employees anywhere and they can serve you better.</Text>

<review>It's extremely short staffed for a busy post office.  Thankfully, the clerks are helpful and friendly.

Save yourself some time and use the self-service kiosk in the lobby.

Parking can be tight so if it's crowded (and it generally is), parking along Postal Way is faster.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dc742f65d63fdb:0xbba4ec5b6e6ab705< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>What a complete JOKE the Postal Service is here in VISTA!  Our postman-  Dallas  is one  vindictive- nasty- disrespectful- pain in our butts!  I have never witnessed such complete and total disrespect for everyone else's property that this man shows all the time!  He personally has told me about other people that are on his "route" that he purposely screwed with them and their mail! This is the mailman that has worked for our Postal Service for over 30 years!  Dallas IS one of THE nastiest men I have ever met!~ WHY is he still able to touch our m,ail? If I could, I would show you how my mail appears in my postbox!

My family and I came here to enjoy some pizza and salad. Unfortunately my sisters salad wasn’t so good. Came with some protein in it. Aka a little critter. Very unsanitary and disgusting. These bugs must be all over their vegetables in the fridge? Thank you toppers pizza for adding a new protein to the menu! Wasn’t expecting to find a bug in any of our salads.< /Text>

<Text>Had to go visit the new location and check it out. I heard it was a fusion of Topper's pizza joint and brewery in one. They didn't disappoint. The pizza 🍕 was bomb 💣 as usual. I order the spicy italian with the little roasted tomatos and hot sausage and the BBQ chicken pizza that has the cilantro and red onions... Awesome. The staff was great too.<//Text>< Resp>

Good pizza, but for a large pizza 2 orders of wings and a sandwich $70. They used to send out coupons, but what happened? After all they would not be in business still if it wasn't for all of us (Customers) right. Just another business taki g advantage of the pandemic. We won't be ordering or supporting Toppers anymore.</Review>

I had a small 3 topping pizza for under 13$ add a tip and its still a good deal. The crust is  good and not thick. It was not crunchy tho . Their sauce is tangy and sweet. Jalapeno toppings were a good amount except for the piece which was from the back end of a jalapeno. They use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.< /Review>

Always loved their pizza and finally got to try their wings... SO GOOD. They do dry rubs with their own special blends (I tried the Asian and holey moley, found that the Asian was actually spicier. Both use a bit of sugar in the rub) the wings are BIG and super crispy as if air fried.<//Text>

<Text>TOPPERS ....to the locals = delicious..!!
Just when visiting the new front street location order your drinks first at the brewery side so you can proceed with ordering you pizza next with the voucher you'll need.  If not you'll loose your place in line and well that just means you need to wait that much longer to eat ...🤯

Transmission brewery and Toppers just put a sign stating to do so first if you need reach out to me in my DM and I'll make one for you 😊

Other than that ...DA BOMB.!
oh ...and you better order TWO pizza cookies cuz you won't want to share after the first bite ..! Enjoy cuz I know we do ..!!<//Text>< pics>

Well, they (my Co-Workers) are so right to put Toppers Pizza in high regards and praise.

Forewarned that the Pizza is worth the price and that price point $12 for a small pizza "Toppers Combo Top Hit Combo".  On this "combo", I requested as Half "combo" and Hawaiian style (Canadian Bacon & Pineaple).  The toppings go to edge of the crust and plentiful and tasteful it was.

I also sprang for some Hot Wings.  The selection of sauce rubs include (Asian, Lemon Peper, BBQ and Nashville Hot). Selecting the Nashville Hot had a ting of sweet upon the bit of that crispy flavorful skin and then... that heat from the fried in sauce bites me back.

Now, there is similar pizza of this style in Northern California Silicon Valley called "Stuft Pizza" very similar to that of "Toppers".   In fact, they are very alike and both establishments are on equal playing field. So either in Ventura area or Fremont ( East Bay) areas, stop by the best pizzas of their respective areas.

I have to rate Toppers Pizza at 4 Stars.  Although, very delicious, a little high price point, it was worth it.  However, unlike Stuft Pizza, they didn't honor Armed Forces or Veteran's status.  Otherwise, the 5 Stars would have been a given.   I recommend it.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It's wasn't thin crust which I asked for. It's not worth the price & it taste like Domino's</text>

The salad bar is always great at any toppers but I have to say the pizza was not what I expected or up to Toppers par. But I did enjoy the new Toppets with its kid friendly seating area and its modern decor its awesome.  Plus enjoy a beer with the brewery located right door that's joined with toppers.<//text>

The wings that only this location offers are a must try especially the lemon pepper ones which are just flavorful. Also being able to sit on the brewery side or the dining side of toppers makes it very convenient.</review>

<Review>DO NOT go to this location if you do not have a DHL shipping label already attached on your package.  It's essentially just a drop off location, no shipping support available.  I have visited few times over couple weeks, their "system is down' every single time and just asks me to go visit other partnered location.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>My package which was for a customer got opened by a dhl employee. He could not put it back together. It is pretty unreasonable to open packages to a level that cannot be put back together. If the policy requires this, then they need to have packaging supplies needed to undo what they do.

I guess I will continue working with other carriers...<//Text><username>Umit Demir< /username>< rate>

Customer service was excellent- friendly, speedy and thorough.  We use DHL for all international express shipments! We recommend using the MyDHL+ portal to create, pay and print labels.  The savings are significant and you'll have fewer steps at the shipment location.  A pickup can also be scheduled so you don't have to go to an office at all.</review>

This location only operates at one speed, slow. Be prepared to wait in line for 30 minutes for a drop off. I would recommend scheduling a pick-up to avoid the line.

I originally went with DHL as the price is lower than UPS or FedEx, but at this point, I wouldn't mind paying a higher price for faster service.<//review>

<review>They need to list clearly a main office and until what time packages can be accepted for see day puck up. I went there hoping to pay a lower price since I was taking the package to them instead of they coming to me. Guess what, it costs more if they have to print a label there insteD of I printing the label at home. Difference of not printing the label at home was almost $30 additional cost. They never mention this anywhere in there website. Disgusted with lack of information and additional costs, in protest, I went to FedEx. Paid the same price at FedEx but at least I was mentally prepared after dhl debacle. I give them less than one star. They used to be a good company but no more.</review>< resp>

Horrible company with (IMHO) highly questionable business practices. Case in point; as I was informed yesterday by a senior DHL supervisor (unbelievably) DHL opens all shipments from what they refer to as 'unknown customers' - that being new customers. Yes, you read right, as crazy as it sounds, here are the exact words of this agent: "All shipments from an unknown customer are inspected." So for anyone reading this who does not want some unknown klutz opening their package, if you qualify as an unknown/new customer this IS what is going to happen. In my case, even though I have done business with DHL multiple times so far this year my package was opened & a gift that was supposed to have been included by the shipper I was unable to find. Never again.</text>

<text>I ordered a 6 to 7 pound fairtex product from Thailand. The original ship was by DHL and cost around 50 usd accoding to the sender. The product looks like an used item so I would like to return with the exact same DHL package.
Not only the DHL office here is 5 to 6 times slower than any other carrier such as USPS, Fedex or UPS, firstly the receipt man complained their own DHL brand package was not neat and pretty enough, then after I re-worked on the package and waited for nearly 1 and half hours,
he was going to charge 300USD for shipping back the exact same product with the exact same DHL package I received one week ago.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>5 stars only because things went smooth. Walked in. Showed the notice that was on my door at home and my ID to the man behind the counter. He walked through a door behind him. Very short wait. He walked in holding a pretty package. I signed.

Extremely disappointed.  The hours showed open till 8pm on weekdays and I got off work and rushed there and arrived at 7:55pm. The lady saw me twice but don’t even attempt to talk to me. Try knocking for attention and was basically ignored. If you can’t be opened at 8pm, don’t put your hour saying till 8pm. And don’t ignore your customers.</Review>

I'm writing this Review for DHL service not in particular for this location. I recently sent an International package just to try out whether DHL is competing equivalent to FEDEX or not. I should say it is total waste of my efforts to try with DHL. DHL failed to deliver the consignment as per the schedule and they were unable to give proper timelines even after delaying the delivery. For International packages, i would say look for other alternatives.< /Review>

<review>This is the most horrible Cargo service I ever see.  I just came to drop off box with paperwork and ready to ship but one of DHL service guy denied the service and asked whether I have to go to other location or wait until 12:00pm to have a drop off service.  I asked what's kind the service in here.  HE stated "no service guy available to serve me.  I had no clue from his statement.

After 12:00pm, come back and service guy in here.  However, it took me more than hour of waiting even though service guy served only 2 customer in front of me.

If DHL is going to bankrupt, I am not wonder why< /review>< UserId.>

Good to have a local depot which, oddly, is not listed on the DHL "Find a Location" website. A few things to keep in mind:
- Be patient - things move slow. Staff seems inexperienced.
- Generate, print  and pay for your label online ahead of time if you can. It will still take a while, but this will help
- Your packages will be opened and inspected (TSA requirements) so don't bother taping up your boxes in advance
- There are no shipping supplies like you might find at a FedEx or UPS Store
- Counter is open until 8pm but drop-off by 5pm if you want it to go out same day<//text>

I went there to drop off some documents to be sent internationally. There is only one customer rep to serve the line. Space is tiny. I am using the company account but my driver’ license was photocopied. I feel uncomfortable having my id photocopied. The rep said it is their rules to do it every month. Weird.< /Review>

I had to leave, ordering my food was so difficult. For some reason the girl kept repeating my order, asking me the same questions over and over. And then she stop talking and never said, " can you hold on". I was over it, I didn't want anything after that. I went to another location. Customer service could be better.<//Text>

I like eating inside, the cool about it is that they offer free wiffi so that's cool because you can eat while you watch something on your tablet. I love the big mac here is the best burger they have.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYIRa-abu5iKIZKBf74AnkXg8ctwRvhSp1O0Er=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2cb4fdbbba5d3:0x93cb980c890de5de<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a number 9 which is 2 cheeseburgers. Instead I got chicken patties?at least make a proper mc chicken. These people are so incompetent. I cannot fathom the level of stupidity at this location. Make the drive to alondra and long Beach for better service. It never fails here.</text>

This is second time I have visited this  McDonald's. First time I have waited 20 minutes to make my order but when I ordered and ready to  pay system when down I was waiting for system to reboot, I have waited another 10 mins system did not reboot and manager ask me to leave since system is not rebooting. Second time all the employees were working on drive thru section, not one employee working at the counter until someone kept calling for assistance.<//text>

<review>I live fairly close to this McDonald’s and every time I go, I have issues. I go through the drive through because I often have my kids in the car with me. Most recently, my items that I’ve bought are not in the bag. I don’t usually have time to check the bag. And with covid, don’t really feel comfortable anymore.</review></record></dataset><record>

The simple hamburger is relatively cheap... but start adding french fries and a few other items and the price goes up (which makes an In N'Out burger a better choice.)< /Review>

<text>This was worst service i have ever experienced at a mcdonalds. We ordered 3 cheeseburgurs and 1MCchicken and large fries, with 1 coke and 1 large caremal frapichinno. Thet only gave us 2 of the 3 cheese burgurs , no ketchup packets with the fries, and my frappichino had a broken top so i poked my self trying to drink it and and they only gave us 1straw when we ordered 2 drinks</text>< pics>

I haven't been here in a few years.  I was very disappointed on my shrimp and fish tacos.  They shrunk them to a third of its original size.  These type of tacos don't go on the tiny corn tortillas, but the normal bigger size.  There were only two tiny shrimps on my shrimp taco and  a 2"-2.5" piece of fish on my fish taco.  The flavor remain delicious.  They also had the option of having them as a combo with rice and beans.  Not all Mexican food goes with rice and beans.  These tacos go well by themselves, perhaps accompanied with cucumber in lemon juice.  They're supposed to be a "fresh-beachy" type of meal, the beans and rice warm it up.  I don't think I'll be buying the tacos from here again.< /Text>

The employee's and the manager have absolutely no regard for customer service,I walk in and 3 customers are waiting to order while all employees including the shift manager are chatting away 5 ft from the us.then I need the code for the restroom so I approach the them and again,get ignored for 5 minutes in I ask out load.!
Will not be coming back.</review>

Purchased 2 kids meal ( 4 piece chicken nuggets and hamburger). The hamburger bread was dry and once again they failed to put the dipping sauce in as requested for the fries. Also,as I was ordering my food in one lane two other cars just went on through the other lane. I told the male employee Who was taking my order if he was going to Have the two drivers go back around so I wouldn't how to wait. He just "No" I can't do that. So, now I have to wait for them to order and stay stuck in the lane. I thought this was so inconsiderate on McDonald's part to allow others patrons to bypass the line like that.
There are too many eating options available. McDonald's in Compton Shopping Center ( Alameda/Greenleaf) you lost a Customer. You need to abide by your own policies.</text>

No complaints about the food. The restroom smells like pee at all times even though they're constantly cleaning it. Think it has to do with the homeless people going up in there. The bigger stall in the ladies room doesn't lock, so on occasion I've walked in on old Chinese and korean ladies peeing. There's also older couples with kids that like to go in there to eat and make out with each other to the point where it looks like they might begin to have sex. Pretty tacky and disgusting when trying to eat. The workers need to do something about this.<//Text>

I had the phat bob burger, (bacon, jack cheese, onion rings, and bbq) frings, (half fries half onion rings, and a nutella milkshake. The burger and the onion rings were good but the fries and milkshake were godly. Off taste its a 4 star spot for sure but prices have increased alot from whats on google and a standard meal without upgrading to kobe or buffalo meat can end up running you like 30 bucks which is high for gourmet kobe burger meals iv had so its kind of odd for a hole in the wall diner. Definitely big portions tho and put me in a food coma.<//Review>

Sometimes the meat isn't cooked all the way. The last 4 McDonald's I've been to had red meat when I took a bite. Going to stay away for a while. Also 2 times the meat wasn't really warm. The cheese wasn't melted because the patties were just warm.< /Text>

Open time listed is 4am. I arrive at 435am a d the drive through is blocked. I see that there's workers inside so i call and ask at what time do they open and a lady says that they open at 445am. 445am?? Just hated that i had to waste my time and gas.< /text>
