< Review>
I have been going here for the past few years and they are wonderful. They are honest, smart, caring, and very professional - whether it's teeth cleaning or complicated dental work.   I actually look forward to going to the dentist now!!!   If there's work that needs to be done, they let me know and we just get it done quickly.  Dr. Brewer has gone out of his way to ensure that I get the best care which in my case means close consultation with an orthodontist, and an oral surgeon. I feel fortunate to have found Brewer Dentistry  - Bill Anelli<//Review>

< Review>
Everyone at Brewer Family Dentistry has been professional, courteous, warm, and always concerned with my well-being. The dental work is excellent, and my comfort is always a priority. I’m not going to say that I love going to the dentist, who does? But, the Brewer group by far the best I have ever seen.< /Review>

<text>I had my braces installed by Dr. Dean Brewer and Adriana and it was a very smooth experience. Dr. Dean’s team as usual were phenomenal. Adriana told me if a wire is poking to call them asap and when I called them, they immediately set up an appointment to get it fix. The wire was probably moved when I ate.  Always a pleasant experience with Dr. Dean’s clinic from the office ladies Rose, Deedee and Jenny to the dental assistants Adriana, Kaylie etc. I always recommend them to my friends and co-workers whenever a topic about dentists and dental clinics come up during casual conversations at work. If you want quality dental work and staff with pleasing personalities , go with Dr. Dean Brewer’s clinic and thank me later.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x8090541b29ce3323:0xaa5a945fdeed93a1</GmapID></record>

The RDA staff was professional, competent and friendly and the hygienist was excellent with her deep clean. As a bonus, there are TVs mounted on the ceiling which helps pass the time. Office is clean and they have COVID protocols in place; hand sanitizer everywhere and all staff wearing masks at all times. They almost, almost, make me look forward to my next dental appointment.

<review>My 13 year old is scared of the dentist, so when it was time to find a new one for him I was dreading it.
Thankfully we found Brewer Family Dentistry. Everyone I have spoken with on the phone and in person has been so polite and caring. Dr. Amanda Brewer was very gentle with him and explained everything to him so he wouldn't be scared, they even did an orthodontic consult the same day just to talk about what our options are and that doctor (I believe it was Dr. Dean) was also very gentle and kind and caring. They gave us all of our options for us to consider with no pressure and are working with the insurance to find out how much so I can plan accordingly. This is easily the best dentists office I have been to in my life and my kids lives.<//review><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

I highly recommend the Brewer Family Dentistry. Am 75 years old and have gone to many dentist throughout my life but I can truly say that have never received the care I receive from them. My family started going as well and they are impress with them as well. My daughter even brings her daughter from Los Angeles to have her dental work done at the Brewer Family Dentistry.<//review>

I have been with Drs. Brewers (Dr. Dean and Dr. Amanda) for a long time.  They are terrific and the hygienists are truly awesome!  They make me feel comfortable being there, despite my dislike for having to go to the dentist... haha (but that's normal, right?).  I really cannot say anything negative at all!  A lot of positivity, in regards of COVID-19 and they go to the extra length (such as face guards, disposable gowns, etc.) to make sure everyone is safe and healthy as possible.< /text>

<Review>Fantastic family dentists they are caring, friendly and professional. This is the best dentist office around! Brewer Family Dentists honestly care about their patients and their individual needs. They will bend over backwards to accommodate your needs for dental care. They will walk you through and explain any and all treatments that may be necessary. They will also give you a schedule of treatments tailored to fit your needs. I wouldn't dream of seeing any other dentists.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I’ve always received quality and compassionate care with Brewer Family Dentistry over the years. In light of the recent pandemic, Brewer Family Dentistry has taken many precautions to make sure that both patients and staff are safe with PPE change before every patient, and offering little to no aerosol to keep the spread of COVID down, among many other precautions. Thank you for the consistent and quality care. Keep up the great work!< /text>

Even though my insurance has changed over the years and I have to pay a little out of pocket now, this is one of the few businesses that remembers who you are, has a nice treat when your session is completed, and they Turkey work to make everything easy and effortless when it comes to paperwork, appointments, and paying your bill. I hope to never need to change dentists.</Review><date>1574714867572<//date></record></dataset><record>

<date>1568244370587<//date><text>Friendly and supportive staff. Excellent work. I had to go in four times over the last year and all procedures from tooth cleaning to crowns went very smoothly. Being very picky, I found both crowns to fit very well and they feel just like my real teeth. Overall, the office runs like a well-oiled machine. All appointments were right on time and communication about appointments was very helpful. They are pricey in comparison to others, but the quality of service and skill is much better than other dentists I’ve been to in the area. Overall, I am very confident in the work they do.<//text></record>

<review>I have been a patient of Brewer Family Dentistry for a couple of years now and happily recommend them to family, friends, and clients.  It is a family atmosphere, and it is nice to be recognized and called by your name when you walk in.  The staff is always friendly and seem genuinely happy to see you.

<Text>This is a very professional and caring dental practice.  Both Dr. Dean and Dr. Amanda provide excellent, highly-skilled dental care.  My wife Colleen and I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a dental practice, providing the best preventative care from excellent hygienist to any needed dental work from outstanding dentists and dental assistants.  The office staff are welcoming and efficient.  Just a wonderful overall team at Brewer Family Dentistry !!!</Text><user_id>117130030218453084667< /user_id><date>1562808183299</date><Rating>5</Rating>< gmapID>

The receptionist was kind of cold and just shuff the questionnaires for me to fill without much explanation     or emotion which is unusual for the practice.
I’m a health care provider and I know what should be said and how to do it.< /Text>

I felt a sharp point on my back molar and thought maybe I had broken a tooth. I called and they got me in immediately. When I came in for my appointment, they took me back right on time and Dr. Dean looked at my tooth and saw it was a quick fix (tooth wasn’t broken...just worn down and needed bonding). Dr. Dean fixed it right then and I was in and out in less than 30-minutes! Love them here. All the employees are super nice and the dentists are amazing! I recommend them to all my family and friends!< /Text>

<Text>I  went in today for a routine hygiene appointment.  My experience is another in a long list of affirming reasons why I have remained with this dental practice for over 30 years.  Brewer Family Dentistry has always taken the responsibility for the health and protection of their patients and staff very seriously.  I would not hesitate to return tomorrow if needed. They are doing an excellent job in the midst of COVID.  Read on if you are interested in more detail:
Before entering the office, hand sanitizer and masks along with a visual reminder to social distance were available.  A plexiglass barrier has been installed in the reception area, more hand sanitizer  was available in multiple locations along with more social distancing cues. Each patient received a temperature scan prior to entering the waiting area. All staff that I encountered  were wearing masks.   All non essential items have been removed from the waiting area, and remaining furniture arranged to comply with social distancing. Instead of  toys and magazines, an air filter quietly hums in the corner.   My hygienist wore a protective gown, gloves, mask and a clear shield that covered the front portion of her head and face down to her chest.  Some equipment has been either modified or upgraded to diminish aerosol disbursement.
All said.... a very good experience and worth  the "risk"  to maintain the health of my teeth.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1591911772826, 'text': 'Deanna, thank you so much for the great review.

Always a great experience in this warm and friendly dental office. From the front desk to the dental staff and billing, everyone makes you feel so welcome. In addition, I just moved by 3 children over to this practice and am so happy that they are a sincere and honest group of people. I brought them over from another practice where they had began to utilize more of a sales approach rather than an honest approach for procedures and recommendations that were not warranted for my children. Thank you to Dr. Amanda Brewer for providing us an honest overview of my child's current situation. It is greatly appreciated!</review>

<review>This is a great dental office.  I have a ton of anxiety about going to the dentist, and their staff made me comfortable and relaxed.

I can't imagine a better place for dental work than the Brewer Family Dentistry! For both adults and children! They have the most up to date equipment and technology. I couldn't ask for a nicer, kinder and more professional staff. All of them! They are the BEST! They are like family to me. Their office/ facility is always clean, well organized and beautifully decorated! (I've taken pictures to use some of their decorating ideas). Every inch of the place looks awesome, from waiting room to exam rooms right down to the bathroom. I love being able to watch TV while they are working on me, an excellent distraction and really helps the time fly by. The beautiful trees and landscaping are so serene and park-like. I love going to my dental appointments. (Weird huh?) But true. I love my dentist, Dr. Dean and his wife, Dr. Amanda too! I love my hygienist, Susan and all of the assistants who work on me. I think anyone who gets a job here is blessed because I think it's the best environment to work in and the best bosses to work for. I can't say enough great things about Brewer Family Dentistry. I have been coming here for my and my family's dental work since 1989 when Dr. Kieth Brewer was my dentist (he was fantastic too and the one who started it all!) In all of those years I have never had one complaint or one bad thing to say about the Brewer Family Dentistry. I highly, highly recommend them and their services.< /Text>

Rose and DeeDee always greet you by name with a smile.  Daniel is new and was very polite and easy to talk with . Dr. Amanda does not waste any time, numbed me with barely a pinch, drilled out the broken filling and put in a new one like she was on a pit crew! 😁

Dr. Dean Brewer is the most awesome dentist I've ever been to. He knows I'm a complete coward with terrible dental anxiety, and he gets me through it every time! I've been a patient for years and recently lost my dental insurance...leaving me with a slim selection of dentists that I didn't want to pick from. Brewer Family Dentistry worked with me and I was able to be treated by Dr. Dean for a very reasonable price. Thank you again Dr. Dean!< /Review>

By far the best dentistry office.  Professional and friendly, and they use the latest technology available to make your visit as stress free as possible.  Crowns are milled in office to fit your tooth exactly, so there is no repeat visit necessary. I love it!</review>

<text>I was impressed by the entire staff. The moment I came I felt comfortable with all of them. Best dental office I have ever been in. Dr Brewer takes the time to listen and explains what you need to know. I recommend Brewer Family Dentistry to anyone looking for a good dentist< /text><user_id>118387311895771834032<//user_id>< Response>

Had a crown put on today.  The whole process finished in just a little over 2 hours, with the most up-to-date equipment I've ever heard of.
Also by the best dentist around, Dean Brewer, along with his great staff.  Not one second of pain, and enjoyed HGTV the whole time.  Really a pleasant experience!<//Text>

From the first call, I felt that I was being engaged as an individual as opposed to just another new patient. Today I went to my first appointment and was greeted with a smile that made me feel like they were happy I was there. Each person I interacted with made it a point to make eye contact, smile, and connect with me in a personal way. The staff and Dr. Dean explained everything they were doing and helped to reduce my anxiety.
I look forward to working with this team and recovering a smile I can once again be proud of.<//Text>< Pics>

The dentist and their staff are very friendly, their hygienists are awesome and try to make it as painless as possible. However on 3 separate occasions i have been sat down in the  chair at my appointment time and had to wait 30+ minutes in the dentist chair , might as well leave me in the lobby and not get my hopes up of getting out of there quick. Other than that, great and friendly staff!!< /Review>

I have been bringing my daughter here since she was 4. She was so nervous to go to the dentist for the first time, she asked me a million questions. What I love is this staff is always so welcoming and kind. Every time we go now she is excited and can't wait to watch a show while they work on her teeth. If you have children - I would totally recommend Dr. Amanda!< /Review>

I hate going to the Dentist because of the pain .This  visit is the first time back I had tried another Dentist who I didn't have success with. Dr Brewer is amazing. Never did I experience any great discomfort. I was done in an reasonable amount of time. His staff is very professional and Have good personalities. Great people make the visit more enjoyable.

<review>Be careful when you go here. They told me I had 10 cavities the total came out to over 4000 dollars and my insurance would only cover half of it. Got a second opinion at Rosenbaum's and they said I had 4 cavities totalling out to a copay of 120 dollars. Every fee from Brewer office for a filling was in between 236-400 dollars. At the other office they were in between 94 and 124 dollars. There is an excessive difference here. I cried walking out of the Brewer office. I am so happy i got a second opinion.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I normally don't write reviews but for this office I had to. I'll start off by saying everyone at this office is very friendly. I had a great experience here from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. There was some technical difficulties with the computer system but where has anyone been where once in every blue moon the systems don't glitch and decide to have a mind of their own. Neverthess their professionalism overshadowed any mishaps the computer had so I will definitely be continuing here at this office. They are also punctual and don't have a wait which is a plus in any office you go to. I used to to work at a dentist and where I worked couldn't even compare to how they run this office. Excellent job here at Brewer Family Dentistry.

Very very pleasant experience. Everyone in the office was incredibly nice and always make me feel very comfortable . They're very careful and very considerate I never have a painful experience. I tell everybody that I hear you're looking for a dentist that they should called Brewer Family Dentistry<//Review>

Nothing but awesome experiences at Brewer Family Dentistry.
Calm, Professional and Caring environment, everyone seems to
know what the heck they are doing. Had a crown put in hastily by
another dentist in town, horrible, had to chew on one side of my mouth for 18 months because no-one would take my word for it that something
was wrong. Dr Dean worked his magic with his high tech tooth making
machinery, replaced the crown, and, voila... all was right in my world...
Thank You Brewer Family Dentistry< /Review>

Very professional. I was comfortable at all times. The procedure was a crown replacement which I've had before. This is by far the best experience ever. The whole team is excellent.<//Review>

I have been a patient of this practice for nearly 3 decades and they never fail to provide exceptional care.  I also trust their conservative approach, and absolute honesty.  And, last of all, their infection control, and comfort measures are impeccable.  Thank you!</Review>

Again, Brewer Family Dentistry hits it out of the park and gets a 5 Star rating! They are excellent and at the top of their class in service, professionalism, friendliness, orderliness, cleanliness, decor, landscape, chairside manner, tv viewing in the ceiling to distract while getting dental work done and the newest category -excellence in providing safety for patients and staff during a pandemic! I typically have been staying home much of the time and steering clear of crowds, stores and the like but I felt completely safe at the Brewer Family Dentisry office today and came home with a beautiful new smile thanks to Dr. Brewer and my perfectly fitted implant. This is still, without a doubt, the best dental office in the central valley and beyond.</Text>

I'm mainly comfortable because Dr. Dean and his amazing staff.  I've always hated going to the dentist (as i'm sure most would agree) but I really have enjoyed my visits here. Dr. Dean is extremely nice, personable, explains in detail all his procedure and most importantly makes you feel like your best interest is his best interest.  From the front desk with DeeDee and Rose, Gloria my hygienist, and of course my pal Brit who's taken care of all my ortho appointments. All of his team (family really) is A+ and will take care of you from when you first step foot in the office. I owe them a huge thank you for changing my smile, taking care of my health, and really becoming some of my favorite people :)  Thank you guys!< /review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) A dentists office that you can trust, very friendly, clean. I have enough that I went the first time (2008) and even the work they did for me is in good condition. It is difficult to go to the dentist many times but they make the experience more pleasant.

(Original)
Una oficina de dentistas que puedes confiar, muy amables, limpios. Tengo bastante que fui la primera vez (2008) y aún el trabajo que me hicieron esta en buenas condiciones. Es difícil ir muchas veces con el dentista pero ellos hacen que la experiencia sea más agradable.<//Review>

It was okay.. I feel like they took good ideas that worked at other places and made them here. Unfortunately they replicate recipes but I feel like there is nobody there actually tasting the dishes.

My cheeseburger was very bland and obviously frozen. The fried cheese on top was good. The fries were undercooked and not even salted :/

The breakfast burrito was good, I am always a fan of beans in a breakfast burrito but these were a bit dry for my liking.

They have cool ideas but they fail to bring any flavor to anything.<//Review>

< Review>
We drove from the Los Angeles area for a hockey game across the street and this place was recommended by a friend. My son said it was the best barbecue he's ever eaten. The only problem was that they ran out of many items so others in our party were not able to have any. Maybe they should have more on their Saturday Barbecue days. The hamburger,  sandwich and mac n cheese I'm told was good and their homemade onion rings were delicious. They have a large menu,  something for everyone.  I would recommend  it.</Review>

Delicious and affordable. This is one of those locally-owned places you wouldn't know to frequent. I was early to a business appointment nearby, and stopped in for breakfast. I ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo. It was a beautiful monster! I saved half of it for tomorrow. I'll make a special effort to go here next time for breakfast or lunch to try other dishes.</Text>

<user>105057152552255066114<//user><Review>BBQ is my favorite food so rate a little tougher when I find a place like this. I went on a Saturday when they do the bbq special. I hear it’s more popular for the sandwiches but I’ll be back another day.

Go for the meats not the sides. This has a different flavor compared to traditional bbq. There is a lot of Mexican influence with jalapeños, spicier flavors layered on bbq. I’m not saying it’s bad but something unique to Z&M. Their house is sauce you can literally drink out the bottle.

I thought the pulled pork could have been juicier and the brisket should be sliced thinner. Both were spiced perfectly and had good overall. Imo, drop the money for the ribs. By far the best value and they were the highlight for me. If you want something a little different, they have a sandwich that mixes all the meats with slaw and jalapeño that was different. The sides were pretty bland overall and they don’t have collard greens. You cannot have bbq without collards< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPASBYp3NcrEu7kDjDT7j49wWR0v5QW3hH23Uq_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< name>

<review>Reserved our food days ahead and payed for it ahead. We get there and tell them our name and they tell us their out of most the stuff we ordered and payed for. The reason we ordered ahead of time is they don’t make enough food. I would not eat here again and would not recommend the place. They are not dependable and the food is not worth the frustration. Stay clear of this place.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Very casual, family friendly dining environment. I enjoyed a tasty salad. The owner shared a sample of a delicious spinach salad, best salad dressing ever! The onion rings are great, not greasy. Bon appetit!</Review>

<review>Ate there on a Saturday for lunch.  Pulled pork sandwich came with two sides at a fair price.  I choses the mac/cheese and beans.  The sandwich was too big to eat for me...the sides were homemade and excellent.  Saturday's are BBQ days, so there are some "extra" specials.  I really like this place.</review>< pictures>

<review>Came in today.... got the 3 meats sandwich, which is seriously one of the best when paired with the bbq sauce and those jalapeños. Problem today, was that I had some 2 inch long thing that was either a bone or some semi hard connective tissue. I understand we’re eating an animal, but before shredding - maybe take out the bones and such? It was absolutely disgusting and haven’t thought about anything else all day.

Aside from that, I always loved the food, the sandwich, owner seems like a great guy. My daughter loves it too.< /review><name>Brandon VonDavid<//name>< rate>

<Review>Went in for breakfast for the first time. No one came to wait on us and finally asked for a menu and service. Was told you go to the counter to order. No sign indicating this. Am low carbing and could only get an omelet. They would not lower the price for ala cart and said they did not have any fruit to replace the potatoes and toast. Omelet good, but will not be back as they do not cater to folks low carbing. Was going to try a burger in a lettuce wrap and get a small salad. NO small salads, only their specialty salads. Cost too high by the time you try yo put a low carb meal together. This place needs to do better for Keto eating folks which is HUGE right now.<//Review>< Pics>

I'm saddened by my experience today. I ordered the Greek pasta salad and it was so small it wasn't worth the price. There was no feta cheese like I was hoping and it was extremely sweet. I love this place and they have great food I'm just disappointed hopefully I can have a better experience next time</review>

Friendly service, Cubano Pinini was filling and the pasta salad good. Beers are very cold.
I will revisit soon to try other menu items.<//Review>

Unassuming place tucked away in the industrial area of Cathedral City behind the Pickford Theater.

Not crowded at all in the late dinner hours approaching 7p. Food came right out. Huge portions. More than enough for adults to share plates and sandwiches. My family of 4 ate to full on just 3 orders.

I thought the prices were a little high. Not for the quality, which was just fine, but for the atmosphere and setting. It kinda hovers just above the greasy spoon vibe.

I’ll definitely go back.<//review>

You can tell everything is homemade, and from scratch. The BBQ on Saturday is always great. The rest of the dishes are really really good. A good bargain too; might be a little pricey but it's all good quality stuff. They have a rewards program, but no one can seem to figure out how to redeem the reward I have. It's a free program, I get it, but why have the program if you can't use the reward?<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Thai chili sauce on the wings. No need for blue cheese or ranch. Apparently they do BBQ on Saturday's but we didn't try it. Maybe next time. Friendly service. The place is kind of hard to find and parking is limited, but it was worth it for those wings.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80db02d70ae07e55:0xe57ad87305ed4097< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Just discovered this place and we’ll definitely be back. The Cowboy is a great BBQ pork sandwich, sort of Cuban style (pressed). Went here with a group and everyone loved what they got. I’d like to try the sandwich that was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, but they were out when we visited.<//Review>< pics>

Oh my goodness! Amazing chicken. Meat was fall off the bone tender. Best BBQ in the desert! I ordered  Triple meat combo with chicken, shredded pork, and brisket. Brisket was smokey and tender. They also make their own BBQ sauce. Super delicious. The meat is better quality than any other BBQ chain I have been to.</Text>

We love this place. Everything is so fresh and yummy. We are becoming regulars for the Saturday BBQ. Tried the pastrami today. It was so juicy and tender. We want to eat our way through the menu. Next up, chicken and waffle. Consistently good and the staff is very friendly and efficient. It's a happy place. P.S. The tuna melt is a favorite.<//Text>

I've been here maybe 4 times over the last year. I was interested in this place because of Guy from Diners Drive Ins & Dives.. Ehhh it's just ok, I wanted it to be so much more everytime, I tried something different in hopes. But each time, each meal always disappointment. Either lack of flavor, not good flavor combinations, or not so fresh tasting.< /review>

My mom and I tried out their breakfast menu and we both enjoyed what we ordered. The atmosphere is very casual, the prices are extremely reasonable, the staff are courteous, and most importantly the food is awesome! Be sure to try a side of their pulled pork with eggs. You won't be disappointed!</text>

<text>I have given it 2 tries. The salad was uninspired the first time, the cheese quesadilla the second visit came without anything. No sour cream, no salsa, no garnish, barely grilled. Truly a waste of $7. I hate this place with the passion of a burning sun. Never again. Horrible.<//text>< response>

<text>Zobo was featured on Guy Fieri's show a while back. I went for breakfast expecting a great meal. I was disappointed. I think this was an off day. Bacon was not flavorful or hot. Service was week. Food was mediocre. I expected better and  will go one more time to see if i hit an abnormal day.<//text>< Pics>

Great local's spot on Perez Road among auto body and repair shops. Cool rewards program. Different food, not just a run of the mill burger joint. BEST blue cheese dressing anywhere in the valley. Well known for their BBQ and pulled pork, plus affordable pancake specials in the morning.</Text>

<text>There is no doubt the sandwiches are good, but there is nothing stellar about this place. It's quick and decent food and service, but I cannot find why this place gets such high acclaim.  Additionally, the space is huge but Spartan except for the odd table set up for local business brocures.</text>< resp>

I find most of the food here to be good,  nothing too special,  but definitely not bad.   It is a great spot for those that work in the area to eat something that isn't typical "fast food" .  We stop in every once in a while.   Had the Monte Christo last time.  Was good,  but the fake maple syrup didn't cut it.   The leftovers were better with pure maple syrup.  The paninis are a good bet.<//Text>

First timer, ordered pastrami sandwhich, nice thick sandwich. I took exception to the thick mustard slathered on the bread made the sandwich experience too sour. My hubby loved his tuna melt though</Review>

Total disappointment.  Went based on DD&D visit by Guy Fierri,  two of us ordered hamburgers and two ordered pulled pork and macaroni.  Hamburgers were OK but the buns were really good.  The pulled pork was bland with no apparent seasoning.  Tried salt, pepper and even BBQ sauce to no avail.  What a shame, particularly since we had out of town guests with us.  On top of everything else, parking can be quite a challenge.< /Text>

Sandwich and omelet place. Food is affordable, lots of carbohydrates, eggs were over cooked. Sandwich was ok but too much iceburg lettuce.<//text>

<review>1st visit, won't be back. Omelet was dry and over cooked, peppers and onions under cooked and still very crisp, homestyle potatos under cooked and lacked flavor. Do i need to say anymore.<//review>< Rate>

This place is totally legit and EVERYTHING Guy Fieri said it was... SUPER FUNKALICIOUS!!! If you're in the area it's a must try!! I come to the desert every year for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells...have a condo in Cathedral City, so thanks for featuring these guys on Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives, Guy!! Always looking for new great places to try when I'm out here! 😁< /text>

The staff at Valley Golf is friendly, and knowledgeable. I'm new to golf, and they were able to help answer any and all questions I had. I originally came in to have a new grip put on my pitching wedge. They had it done quickly. In the mean time, I was able you explore the rest of the store. It looked like anything you need for golf, they have. Just ask. Great first time experience there.</Text>

They spent over an hour with me in the hitting area which led me to buying a beautiful new set of clubs. And the best part? NO ONE was wearing a mask. It was so wonderful to see everyone’s face again. Will continue to support this place.<//review>< username>

My sister and her husband walked away from a full set of fitted clubs for her husband when at least five employees would not wear masks. I hope management thinks that’s a fair trade in loss of sales.</Text>

<Text>Good retail store, but not for club fitting, or what would be better described as "club demo".  You basically try a few clubs and they ask which one you liked the best, show you the data, and then encourage you to purchase that club(s).  Real club fitting includes matching the shaft (manufacturers offer a number of shafts to choose from) with your swing.  That's not what they do here.</Text></record>

Lots of clubs to choose from. Friendly staff always ready to help you with a proper club fitting. Decent prices too</review>

I was not impressed. I am a southpaw and the selections on display was very limited. I only found 2 choices, both were used clubs so I have no use in coming here.< /text>

Brought my teenage son in for some new clubs.  They spent a good amount of time with him, letting him hit with different clubs, talking with him, making sure he was getting what he needed. Extremely happy we chose this shop!! My son LOVES his new clubs!  We will definitely be back for anything else golf!</Text>

Excellent service with a very knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Been there several times for various products.  Some time ago I went in to have my clubs regripped and the turnaround time was outstanding.  Most recently I had my putter regripped, but they didn't have the grip I wanted in stock.  They were able to get it in and installed within a few days.  Never pressured and always professional.  Heading back soon for some sorely needed Irons.  Looking forward to the experience.<//Text>

<Time>1559772668822</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Very brand new to the game. Came into the store for advice on what type of clubs to look for when going to the range to practice. I informed the rep I was brand new and had only been to a driving range twice...ever...(the 2nd time was minutes before arriving!!) and that I was looking for basic information of what to look for in clubs I borrow when at the range practicing, you know, like, the length of the club to be sure I don’t pick one too short or long and create poor practice habits—yes I know every iron has a different length (that’s what google taught me). I was going to a Pro Shop for advice and thought this was the best place based on reviews and their website.

I was met with “well I don’t know what they have at the range, ma’am, all I can tell you is to use a ladies club.” (Really?? This is what I came in for? For him to tell a woman to look for a ladies club.) He asked if I could just talk to the people at the range. (Well of course I can talk to them. And I did, however they recommended I go to a pro shop for a basic fitting and then I would know what size to actually be looking for since their clubs vary from day to day...made sense to me!) So, I came to Valley Golf for education and help...at some point, in the near future, in a position for a real fitting and purchase of equipment.

For a woman, well anyone really, that is brand spankin’ new to the sport, ignorant of the  language/lingo, it was the worst possible experience!! There was no effort to help me learn what I needed. It was awful. I left upset and then poked my head back into the store to let them know they totally lost my business. The guy followed me to my car, trying to recover a very poor customer service experience, but it was too late.

For a business that prides itself on being a “people first business”, it seemed as though education is at the bottom of their priorities (or at least that emoloyee’s). Perhaps other employees have different approaches, this guy, for me, today....discouraged me...all my efforts to find a quality pro shop that would support my efforts to learn and grow in the sport now begins again.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Worse golf location starting out with the manager Jeff which I dont know how he has the position hes got?? Its been nothing but headaches here, I spent well over 3k in a month and when I bought my club set they told me I had a month to try them and exchange for others if I dont like them well a week later I come to do my exchange and Jeff is making a million and one excuses and finally the older guy helped me out and I even payed the extra price so dont know what the issue was if I was well under my 30 days and I was paying??? Eevrytime I come in Jeff has the worse attitude ever and makes u uncomfortable then my A wedge broke and he charges me 52 dollars to fix and I pick it up and go play and breaks the Same day?? Obviously the iron is defective and I tell them I want a replacement and again typical Jeff making excuses I'm well over this place and the lies I hope everyone sees this and doesnt go here and gets ripped off and bad service starting with all the lies there make the drive dont make the same mistake I did and I hope thry cha ge management to someone else that cares and actually wants to help cuz clearly Jeff isnt the guy</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Really bad customer service !  Jeff the store manager was unprofessional and extremely bad to me trying to explain a problem. I try to explain about letting him have my email address on file. Everytime I would speak he would interrupt me and not let me finish.  I continuely ask him to let me finish my statement. He would not let me finish and at one point he grab the $200 putter I was going to buy and in a very bad tone told me to get the hell out of my store.
I called his general manager to make a complaint and he did not seem too much concerned about my treatment.</Text>

<Review>Just visited this place and NEVER will again. Was asked if I could be helped in the middle of explaining what I was looking for he addressed he co worker and then just walked away from me. I waited for a while giving benifit of doubt and was never returned to. My wife was with me also and was never asked if she would like to be helped either. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER service. I will drive to another golf store.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Old apartments with less amenities (gym & pool). For the same rent, you can get better and newer apartments in downtown. Though its gated, most of times the doors are not closed. Management didn’t fix this during my 1 year tenure of stay. AC is in living room only. Only best part is large store in patio.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Cons
- Very poor management team.
- They will keep your deposit no matter what and charge you even more when you move out.
- They charge you for everything, water, hot water, gas, trash, parking, and a lot of other fees so you should add at least $250 + rent.
- Good look trying to find another parking if you have 2 cars.
- Cars getting broken into all the time, and security is just a joke here.
- Getting packages is almost impossible. You will have to go and get them yourself from the local postal office. My packages are getting lost all the time.
- Everything is about money here and I truly mean it.

Pros,
- Clean apartments.
-  Washer and dryer in unit.< /review>

< review>
I had a really rough go around at Villa Torino. They did not give me any security deposit back, when I left the apartment in perfect condition and I had to leave the area due to COVID, which the management team did not care at all about.

In the time I lived there, the management team was horrible. I had a few packages I needed to pick up 30 minutes before the office closed, and one of the managers was rushing me and frustrated that I was picking my items up close to closing time, because his dog had surgery that week...

I also received calls from the management team that my rent was not paid, when it was and the payment was processing. Definitely scary to get phone calls that your rent wasn't paid for in such tough times...

It's a nice apartment complex, but not worth the trouble from the staff and the outrageous rent and lease break penalties. But I guess they're smart in that sense, they absolutely screwed me and made a ton of money off me. When I need to move back to the area, I will not choose Villa Torino and I do not recommend Villa Torino.< /review>

<Text>Lived at Villa Torino for almost 2 years now. The staff at the office are helpful and nice. The only complaint I have is if you live next to the bridge towards Coleman it can get a bit noisy due to construction and with the complex being close to the airport. Otherwise, the apartments are very spacious with high ceilings, clean, and maintenance comes through every time.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPevShcm_VY3AHtVEhlF9boSwTAV_nBlrVKoPib=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I am not sure where to start with this. After living here for 2.5 years, I am adjusting my initial review. Moving out has been a nightmare for my wife and I. All they care about is your money and they will try their best to charge you as much as they could possibly get out of you. Even though the apartment was left in good and clean condition, they are still taking all of our deposit and even charging us more. Due to some issues we had to break our lease which is understandable that we had to pay thousands in fees, but to take all of our deposit and charging us more was not expected. There are so many issues with VT apartments such as parking or even getting your mail is almost impossible, but also there are some positives such good maintenance team , and having a washer and dryer in unit. I would not recommend anyone who value their comfort and money to move to this place as they have such an unethical approach and also keep in mind that you will have to pay additional $300 - $400 for fees on top of your rent.</Text>

<Review>Charged us for various things after move-out, and we had to pay additionally over the deposit amount for those imposed charges. Staff is sometimes rude when it comes to delivering packages or other things. They failed to present the invoice for each charge when asked for and replied rudely. How can we even believe that you are charging us honestly when you are unable to show the proof.<//Review>< user>

Getting packages here is an absolute disaster. They will Nickle and dime you on the way out, lost a lot of the deposit. There was a flood i didnt recognize until i moved in.. Charged me 100 dollars to paint a few small holes in the wall. Charged for steam cleaning for the one small room that had carpet we slept in. Had our place professionally cleaned btw. As expensive as this place is, the only thing they upgraded was their office building. The gates are constantly broken in the gated community also security was talked about, never happened and needed desperately. The worst exp. I have ever had. I can say maintenence is very responsive, if thats all that matters, you're set!<//Review>

<text>I love living at Villa Torino. The community is great. The grounds are lovely and it's nice to be able to enjoy the hot tub and pool day or night year round. The community room is wonderful for hosting things like game nights, brunch, collage nights or workshops even.

A few things to consider - the place is located in between the light rail and the entrance ramp to the freeway. When I was there (during the morning), I could hear the freeway noise outside, but not while I was inside the inner apartment. It's a matter of location, location. Overall, a good option.</text>< pictures>

Living in Villa Torino have been a really nice experience. I have been renting a 1 beth-1bath apartment since 2015 and I decided to renew my lease since then. From the neighborhood which is pretty well located and convenient, to the amenities offered. The maintenance staff is friendly as well as the main office Managers. The place has really nice amenities like the gym, pool and jacuzzi. When it comes to reception of packages, the office have an organized system to receive the packages and inform residents when received. I highly recommend renting an apartment in Villa Torino.< /review>

Been here for a year now! Love living here and the management staff are extremely polite, sweet and accomodating. The apartments are very spacious, with high ceilings, and the amount of space they provide is definitely luxury! The interior gardening and amenities are gorgeous! Everything and I mean everything fun and essential is close by, max 8 minute drive. Entertainment, lots of grocery store locations: Target, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Safeway, College Park Plaza,  San Pedro Square, lots of fun places to go to downtown. The place is located downtown, thus some things are to be expected while living downtown, like making sure to never leave anything in your car, and buying extra chains for your bike. Those things are unavoidable due to where the apartment is placed, and the apartment managers and the VT community do a great job communicating to each other for any suspicious activity, to minimize the problems.< /text>

< Review>
First thing first: All the 5 and 4 star ratings that you see here, were sponsored by the property manager! The property incentivize residents in return for high ratings on yelp.

Pros: Close to Downtown San Jose.

Cons:
1. Majority of the tenants in this complex are students from San Jose State University. 7-8 individuals living in a single apartment.
Irrespective of time of day/night, there is always somebody on the phone in the patio or the corridor/hallways/Balconies or on the street below your apartment. Every night there is a frat party. There are Loud and obnoxious neighbor.

2. The property manager(E) and her assistant(G) are racist AF. Anytime you go to them with a complaint, they argue with you and it always end up in a verbal argument. They always retaliate with an eviction notice for minor little thing. Sooner or later you start complaining  in the fear of retaliation.

3. Poor Security: There has always been security issues at Villa Torino. The Management has failed to address these issues over the past years. Instead of improving security, the spent money on the look and feel of the community and even renovating the leasing office. The cost of adding security cameras and a DVR is much less compared to the amount they have spent on the effing planters. Every year, during the tax season the mailboxes get broken into. Apartments have been broken into in broad daylight. Residents have been attacked by homeless. Homeless have been seen wandering around in the community on several occasion. Bike and other items have been stolen from the patio/balconies of the apartments(even 3rd floor apartments!). Cars are broken into in the parking garage almost every month. The main entrances of the building are always broken and the locks don't work. There is an "off campus" security company, every time you call them, they show up more than an hour later. The tenants security is the lowest priority for EL and Gr.

4. AirBnb: At one point of time, the community had at least 3 apartments available on AirBnb. The management (Eli and Gre) were fully aware of these units, but they chose not to take any action(who knows what they got in return). There were random guests(of all kind) staying in those BnBs. The management had to shut it down after some backlash. They might have moved to VRBO or some thing else.

5. Appliances: Old and barely works. The dryers in the apartments are so old, it takes 2-3 cycles to dry your clothes. The Dish washer is a totally different beast(in a negative sense).

6. Elevators: Majority of the time the elevators in the community are broken and under repair. (Imagine carrying your Costco groceries up the stairs.)

7. Gym: Small overcrowded gym full of residents who lack basic gym etiquette.

8. Rules : The rules which are laid out by the management, change very frequently. The same set of rules don't apply to all the apartments. The management is lenient towards some apartments while the others get eviction notice.

9. Security Deposit: Needless to say, when moving out, don't have any expectation of getting any of security deposit back. They keep the security deposit in the name of "cleaning", even if they renovate the whole apartment after you move out.

Overall, these days there are a lot more options in Downtown San Jose. Pay $50-100 more, but stay away from Villa Torino and their rude Property Managers (Elis** and Greg).<//Review>

I am in the process of signing a lease at Villa Torino. The management staff here has been very friendly and helpful in showing me around the complex and understanding my requirements.

When I was filling my application, I called the office to make an enquiry, but since my call wasn't answered, I did not complete the process. However, the rent for the same unit shot up considerably the following day. The management staff were quite responsive towards my queries and additionally offered to honor the original price I started my application for.

I am quite happy with the service and can't wait to live in this wonderful community at the heart of Downtown SJ.< /Text>

Loved the apartment and was ready to take it. Then spoke to the manager. She never smiled, very rude and talking to me as though I will not pass the credit check.
Two young ladies came to take a new lease when their old one runs out. The manager rude shouted at them to first finish your old lease then come back and we will think of releasing.

I decided to choose another location. Better than deal with this for the next 12 months.< /review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Pro's: location near to a lot of restaurants/bars, nice swimming pool area, spacious apartments, friendly staff.

Cons: Outdated apartments, security/theft is a big issue here (bikes, cars, other items get regularly stolen by outsiders), Gym is outdated.

I give them 2 stars because for the rent prices you expect better security, especially in a down town area. Having your self and your belongings secured is more important to me than some of the pro's.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Beautiful setting and peaceful environment. Relaxing atmosphere in the heart of the downtown concrete jungle of San Jose.< /Review>

Great wing spot. They have all you can eat wings on Monday nights. Lots of outdoor space (they even have tvs outside). Lots of beers on tap and many different wings flavors. Only wish they had more dry rub wings flavors. If you're in Ocean Beach, definitely check this place out. There's also plenty of parking available in the CVS lot directly across the street.<//Review>

Craving wings? Look no further. Dirty Birds has the best wings HANDS DOWN in the San Diego area. Our server, Renee, was beyond friendly and fast with service. You can’t beat the ambiance with the groovy music and outdoor seating. Best wing flavors to try are Aztec, 3 Peat BBQ, Honey Hot, and Hawaiian. The fries are also seasoned to perfection and just the right amount of crispy. A San Diego essential!!< /Text>

I was stoked to get a Dirty Birds in Ocean Beach... No more driving to PB!

...until they brought me out old cold wings. I brought it up to the waiter who gladly went back to get more. Two minutes later he came back with fresh, hot wings! :D

Guys... they were microwaved. Mushy, microwaved wings. I am so sad.</Review>

<review>I love the wings and the atmosphere. Be forewarned: if you like it spicy, most of the flavors on the menu are relatively mild. I order an "8 out of 10" at thai/Indian places, and the level 3-out-of-4 sauces and rubs don't even produce the faintest of tingles to me. Even the mango habañero is mild to me.

I'm not bragging, I just want you to be informed in case you're like me and hoping for heat.

Also, it isn't worth taking a star away for -because everything is delicious- but they have way too many flavors that are essentially the same thing, i.e. 5 different spicy-sweet-Asian styles...</review>< Pictures>

I often go to the Postal Annex at the shopping center. The owner is terrific - friendly and always helpful. Because it is a local small business, I always pay in cash to help them avoid credit card charges.< /text>

A small but wonderful shopping complex. The parking lot is very small, especially for the number of shops, so be prepared to park along the street. The nail salon inside, Dynasty nails, is an amazing and well priced salon with attentive and friendly staff. The Postal Annex is also very well kept with an amazing shopkeeper, and the restaurants are also very well priced for simple but well made eats. Highly recommend!</Text>

Yeah it's an amazing shopping center right off the freeway with almost not enough parking but close vicinity to a Jack in the Box and a gas station - so basically it's everything you could ask for in one spot. They don't call out the gun store too much because no one wants people to know where that is, but! The bar (Speakeasy) is a great place for beer and food. If you don't like their food, go to Original Buffalo wings and top it off with a donut from the donut shop.

Super place to get into trouble or take a first date!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Great hike. Well traveled trail and extremely busy on the weekends.  If walked at a good pace, it is a good workout.  Dog friendly.</review>

<text>One of my favorite places. 3.8 miles out and back. Stay left at every fork to go to the point. The first bit is paved, then you get into some dirt climbs. Be ready for dogs and dust. The creek runs in the winter. At the top intersection, continue straight across the fire road and then take the right turn past some rocks for 200+ degrees of beautiful view. On a clear calm day, you can count all the channel islands.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0sX6yY4SifjzY5_FeSRdVBjMHUhHBL_LjaU2b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuLz5gickkGSIiDMd_FQ1QUsm8kc5NN6k4wKgs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX7DcSZTC2uehtQGCiF3sWfBDCoLuq6yDxi1kC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxArw9Xmn-soqIBNsYbBWG3mHuEH0SoepSzY5V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80e914b3c2ba19b1:0xc22fac5aa31347af<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Easy hike, as in the first chunk of the trail is paved, and the incline up isn't too steep, it's nice and gradual. Running shoes or hiking shoes will do you just fine. Pack some sunscreen and load up on water and you'll be just fine. The view from the top is beautiful.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>It's a somewhat intense hike that starts in mission canyon. A good Mike at the start of the trail head is paved. They're are only a few places where the path gets a little narrow. On the way up to the point you'll also cross over seven falls which usually only has water during the rainy season in late winter-early spring.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

You will have to work to make it up here. There's a couple of trails that will lead you here, all of which have more than a little elevation gain. Careful because a few trails also have mountain bikers and poison oak on them. You also will not be alone when you get to the top unless you're lucky enough to be able to hike it in the middle of a work day.</Text>< Time>

Love this hike! Not too hard or too long. Good family hike for most people above the age of 10 probably. The first bit is kinda steep but not crazy. Great view at the top!< /Review>

Inspiration point from Jesusita trail is so beautiful and relaxing. I did this out and back trail in about 1:45, not including time spent at the top. I prefer the views of the mountains to the view of the city, but the scenery on the way up is just as worth your time as any view at the top of a peak. It's beautiful and green right now (I went on 4/18/18) with little wild flowers along the trail.<//Text>

< review>
The Inspiration Point hike is a bit challenging (you're going uphill until you actually reach Inspiration Point), but it rewards you constantly.  There are beautiful views and wildflowers all the way up.  Just make sure to pack your sunscreen, as there's very little shade on the trail.<//review>

Price Storage San Juan Capistrano, CA,  I've had a unit since late last year.  The staff (2 extremely efficient and friendly women) has provided in a timely manner any service requested - moved to different units as I downsized my storage needs.

Talk about professional support and service !!!!

The staff blew me away !! during the Covid pandemic they bent over backwards and helped me move in because that were open more hours than anyone else !!

They also have the largest 10 x  15 unit ANYWHERE

Everything is New and clean and easy and safe

Best of all I was able to fit 2 units 10x15 into one of Price storages units the same size because the inside height is 14 feet tall !!!!

That’s two units for the PRICE  of one in my book

Thanks to the owner and staff at price<//text>

This place was awesome. They made everything so easy and helped me find the perfect storage unit for the amount of stuff I had. Not only that, it was very affordable and the units are extremely clean and look new. I would definitely use them again and glad I didn’t go anywhere else. You won’t be disappointed. Thanks again for everything!</text>

<Review>Price Self Storage San Juan Capistrano has squeaky clean, easy to access lockers in a very convenient location.  The staff (Mikole and Tom specifically) are professional, very helpful and extremely personable.   They drove me around to see lockers, helped me figure out the locks and generally assisted me in every way possible.
Excellent place and highly recommended.</Review>< time>

My mother had a unit here for several years. The ground storage was priced competitively. The units are very clean as are the grounds. The manager, Mikole, was so helpful and explained all the paperwork and made sure we always had everything we needed. The whole staff always remember my mother by name and was always so nice to is when we came in. Very personal service and great storage facility.</Review>

< review>
Oh behalf of my mother!  I have the privilege  of  writing this for her. Due to the fact she, has been a little ill.
The reason for this well deserved 5 star is because Price Self Storage in SJC! Has earn each and every star.  If a 10 was an option, we would award it.   My mother has come to know the .Team Members, so this is a very honest review!  On many occasions she had shared, with me how accommodating  each team member, went out of their way, to give her reminders.  She is a very busy business women and at times, would forget about the payment.  Because I'm in the " Hospitality Industry" and work for a Fortune 500 company.  We're customer satisfaction must be part of our daily work.   We can say the Team Members, at Price Self Storage SJC  exemplifies just that!  We just want to thank you, again! Nicole for your professionalism and caring actions.  Tom! I am  told you always had a welcoming spirit an kind.  Randy! Thank you for allowing  certain actions to move forward in our favor.  We thank you! Once again for  a very clean and safe place to store our items.  We couldn't have chosen a better place to do so.  After reading this review, I hope you make your storage choice a Price Self Storage choice.

P.S Also the moving guy! We forget your name.Thank you, for moving us.</review>

<Text>Price Self Storage on Valle Rd in SJC was the solution to my problem of how to store my mom's things. They are very professional, very friendly, and ever so helpful. The entire site is clean and neat, their front office is immaculate, and our storage space was super clean. When we were moving our things out after our stay, one of our tires on a dolly went flat and they were so kind as to help us fill it up again right there! Just a super place, recommend it VERY highly! Mikole Annandono was so helpful and an absolute delight to work with!  If you're looking for a storage space, you found the best!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>less than 1 star- If you work with this storage facility it is nice, new etc however the customer service is Horrible and I recommend that any conversations or any type of agreement please get it in writing. We have had our stuff stored here for several months and before renting agreed to have a truck dropped when time to move. We have a 30ft storage and a smaller storage as well (2 storage units) They now won't allow us to drop the trailer and it is last minute before we are suppose to move. Now it is costing us a serious amount of money to find movers, truck and time at the last minute. I would not use this storage if they were the last storage unit on this earth.<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1503683901117, 'text': 'Dear DJ,\nThank you for taking the time to review our business. I wanted to address your comment regarding the access hours. After many years in business, we have determined that the property is most secure when tenants are not allowed access when we don’t have staff working on property. The access hours have been determined based on years of experience, and our 7AM-7PM access ensures that all tenants enjoy a secure environment for their stored items. Having said that, there have been instances where exceptions were made, although I do not know if the facility where you are renting allows for this. If you’d like me to follow up, please email me at marketing@priceselfstorage.com - Kelly M. – Marketing Manager.'}<//Response>

Competitively priced if you reserve online, but they were the only storage business I spoke to who wouldn't make even a little bit of an exception on the access hours for someone who works until the early evening everyday.</review>

Wow I highly recommend Price Self Storage; so glad I stumbled upon this well-kept facility  and highly professional personal and staff. The manager Mikole was so amazing and extremely accomadating and always had a smile! The prices are excellent and the staff is so helpful Maira, in fact, asked me if I needed help with a cart and took the time to give me a tour;  plus wrote out direction on a paper that would be a faster quicker way for me to exit and enter. They are on top of everything and are extremely kind, friendly and treat you as a real person which is so refreshing in these days; most places aren't as friendly! This is a facility that I would highly recommend to all my friends and business associates or even neighbors  that are moving!< /text>

We were faced with moving 2 times in a month. We searched for a storage that was convenient, easily accessible and close to truck rental locations. Price Self Storage not only met our needs but also offered a great discount on the first months rent. The manager Mikole Annandono made sure I understood everything I needed to know with no catches or fine print. I worked with Maira at the front desk who is very friendly and really cares about making sure the customer leaves happy. They both worked together to be sure they understood what our needs were so they could find the best unit for our needs. Even when we went back shortly after to change the size of the unit, they were quick and efficient, however they took the same time to be sure the unit we had was the best for us. if you are looking for a storage unit, this should be the first place you look so you can stop looking. Thank you Mikole and Maira!!! If the need arises, we know where to go!< /review>

This is the best sotrage space ever due to the customer service which is excellent personalized and very helpful.
Amazingly enough there are folks who do still care, and the staff here espially Mikole and Tom helped tremendously and still is very helpful to me as this storage space was procured and facilitated while i was comatose. And she helped through my confusion, with my memory, and even offering me a wonderful upgrade which would of saved me substantially- however i have yet to go through my belongings in this one.
At the worst of times this storage has been just the best. You wont be sorry, the customet service here is abovr and beyond anything youve experienced. Not to mention theyre extremely clean, quiet, and fairly priced.< /Text>

{'time': 1502381175532, 'text': "Dear Tatiana,\nI am very sorry that the truck was not available for you. There are some restrictions that apply to the truck and noted on our website under the Terms and Conditions page. Each facility has one truck, and we can only schedule two truck runs per day because the tenant gets two hours to load and unload. If the truck is already booked for the date you want to use it, we sometimes can try to borrow a truck from another nearby facility. If this was possible, it would have been offered to you. We don't have another facility near San Juan Capistrano so this wasn't possible for that location. And there may be times when the truck is unavailable because it is away for maintenance. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Kelly M. - Marketing Manager"}<//response>

So once the straps came in they could call and I could pay for them and they would ship them to me. No one ever called. I went back a second time and told them what had happened the first time. They said they were so sorry and it wouldn't happen again. A month later still no call. I called th man who helped me and he said he remembered me and forgot would call me first thing in the am....two days later still no call. I am currently on hold trying to talk to someone. This is not good customer service for such a high end store.<//review><Rating>2<//Rating><name>jairo salas< /name>< user_id>

Bought a purse for my wife's birthday 3 years ago. She recently experienced some issues with the strap "glazing". We were instructed to take it into our nearest store. To my surprise when we got there the associate that helped us simply took a look at it and said "pick out another purse..." Great service... Nice people... If you're gonna spend the money, you hope you get this kind of service.< /Review>

If I could give it a 4.5 I would, I noticed when I walked in I didnt really get greeted or asked for help until my mom came in. I really appreciate Simon for being patient with me and my mom when it came to finding the right bag we were there past closing hours, and it didn't seem like he was rushing us to get us out. One thing I also really appreciated about him was the simple that he gave me his card that had his contact information if anything was needed from him. The day after I received my package he even checked in and made sure everything was fine. Thank you Simon!< /Review>

Horrible experience. Walked in and didn’t get greeted or asked for help. I been to so many LV stores and this had to be the worst LV store in Cali. Security guy offered help to 3 ladies with LV bags and showed them a rare limited edition floral keepall. Didn’t know I had to dress flashy and bring one of my bags to get notice. Trash customer service.< /review>

Great customer service from Robert !!! I had been in the store for about 30 minutes everyone ignored me and he was the only one to ask me what I needed started off a great convo and ended up making a great friend my wife loves LV and he will most definitely be my client advisor for a long time!!!< /Review>

<Text>Great  Place. What more can I say other than the simple fact,.. there's nothing like the quality of a real Louis Vuitton. You can spot a fake 50' away. The real thing is so stunning. I love watching a woman walk down the street with her fake Louis Vuitton with her head up in the air acting like she's a Queen when the pattern gives it away immediately.

<Review>If you want to be ignored and treated rudely, shop here.  Went in with my wife to buy her an anniversary gift and after 15 minutes of only being acknowledged by the security guard, we left when the female employee decided it was better to sell a LV key chain then help us.  Save your money for a store that shows some respect to customers.</Review>< user_name>

<text>Not the quality of service I expected, I walked out due to the lack of servise, I had a change of heart, decided to give them a second chance. My mother is having surgery this Wednesday so I thought it would be ideal for me to gift her the dream purse she has always wanted. As her oldest son and existing customer of Louis Vuitton I wanted to make sure she walked away with her gift today. There fore not having the time on a holiday weekend to drive to a different location. She was ignored by one sales person, at this point I looked for a different person..
(only 2)!! Long story short I will either go to Gucci or a different Louis Vuitton, this experience made me remember when I once shopped at Coach and their level of service.< /text>< pictures>

Had trouble getting a LV BumBag from the LV website this holiday. They gave inaccurate stock information saying BumBag was back ordered for weeks, way past holiday. They also stated all stores and affiliates were out. Wrong... Then as I was running out of time, I thought I would call stores directly, that customer service store put me down for a call back from the Palm Dessert store. An employee named Simon called me back and arranged for overnight delivery of the bag we needed. Not only that, but be gave me his cell number for any tracking concerns. There was a glitch with UPS so the package was delayed a couple days, but Simon made sure to follow up and the gift was sent the day before the holiday! The extra level of service that this stranger Simon provided was amazing. A real asset to LV Palm Dessert for sure! Thanks!<//Text>

Not enough selection. If the store is busy the employees get overwhelmed and you might have to wait around for a while. Most of the product is out of stock. Or you have to buy the floor model or wait and have one shipped to your address.<//Review>

My wife visits this store every year.  Today she was not happy with the service.  This is not typical of this store.  So I hope I can amend this review next year.< /review>

I arrived 35 minutes early and was intending on grabbing things to wrap gifts for and condiments and canned foods since they are obviously only one dollar and same quality and I try to save every penny for my family I can. 20 mins before you definitely felt pretty rushed. Maybe wrong day because I have came here several times satisfied at the same time of day and had no issues whatsover. Could be a good or bad day my best guess.< /text>

One of my favorite Dollar Tree location. This store is big, always clean, has, plenty of parking,and is always stocked,but most important has good customer service. I usually stop by in the mornings and its never packed this Dollar Tree carries refrigerated/frozen foods and ice cream. They sometimes are out of helium so if your looking to get balloons I'd call and ask first.<//text>

<Review>It was a very unique experiencethe security guard was dealing with the guy hanging out front doing weird things in front of the store and you can tell that the guy wasn't mentally stable at all but because of the professionalism and I daresay compassionthat the security guard had towards the individual in question he deescalated the situation. It was nice to go to the Dollar tree on Watt Ave in Sacramento California the staff was very pleasant and I felt safe<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809ad91eaa1f0c3d:0x2ae8c4f09becc407</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They were out of bread and water balloons, but they had other water toys to purchase. The store is kept clean and the cashier was friendly.< /Text>

They have a huge supply of everything  for just that id give 5 stars, however. The cashier that is always there when im there has NO joy in her job, she doesn't speak to customers unless its to complain about customers,  i tried 2 times to interact with her but all shes respond with is 'HEH' thats the reason for the 1 star<//Text>

<Text>Shopping earlier in the day is a better experience for me. This place has a variety of items to browse and purchase. Staff was very friendly and super helpful even if there were not many on the floor.  There was a new cashier and she did great alongside her trainer who was very pleasant and patient. I give thumbs up to the customers in line who were also being very patient.  A nice dollar tree, pretty clean and organized. The only thing I wondered about was the many areas fun stickers were found.  It would be nice to see them in one aisle or section. Perhaps with the school supplies and even the toy or book section? Overall, a nice place to browse and shop. Plenty of parking spaces too.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

First times trying this Dollar Tree. Much more refrigerated items than I expected. Extremely neat store. I needed cleaning supplies and they had a great stock. Also saw a bottle of soap bubbles for a buck, it sold at Wal-Mart for $7.<//review>

This place was trashed. Floor was an absolute mess. There was so much merchandise just shoved on random shelves, I didn't even know what aisle I was in. Even the manager has lead in her shoes and zero sense of urgency when our checkout queue was 6 patrons deep.</text>

I wasn't very happy today @ Watt/ Wynonna as 5 or 6 of us stood in line waiting for the checker she had a lot of problems with the person she was checking and another man kept coming and helping her finally he opened a register all he did was stand over there and call so everybody in the back of the line who just walked up ran to be 1st! They got to go over there and be first and if we were to go over there we would have been last there that's really rude he should have come to the person who was the two people in front of me who have been standing there a lot longer< /review>

Save big money on hundreds of items before you shop at the more expensive stores. Especially fun seasonal items like gift wrapped, gift bags, greeting cards of all kinds. Great place to buy all your bathroom and kitchen detergent and soaps, plus personal hygiene items like shampoo and hair conditioner. Have fun and Save. You're going to save lots of money.<//Text>

Found everything I needed. Clerk was courteous and friendly. Outside of store sidewalk had garbage all over was told people steal this garbage cans also drunk or high person right by door. Felt uncomfortable  but was told before I left happens all the time but staff made him move on before I left. Inside I would rate 5 stars outside 2.<//text>

FRIENDLY,HELPFUL STAFF. I have three small children and it's difficult getting out to the car if I make a lot of purchases since the the carts are unable to go outside. They've helped me outside several times and loaded my belongings into the car while I buckled my kids in. I wouldn't spend as much money at this store if they wouldn't offer help out because it wouldn't be worthwhile.I wish there were a larger selection but  it's a small store.< /Text>

The inside of the store floors are very dirty and filthy  looking very unsanitary.
Just because we live in the ghetto doesn't mean that the store establishments should be kept unclean!
I spoke to one of the employees about the condition of the store floors that person was unconcerned about my  concerns.</review>

I appreciate that this store was clean. I think that when there is a line if over three customers another employee should help on the register.< /text>

This location had a huge selection but also a huge line (about 10 people) with only one cashier and I didn't see another worker. Our cashier was great though and fast.</Text>

I would like this Dollar Tree to carry A Refrigerator section.  For Example, I went there thinking because it was closer that they would have Meat 2 go with my Noodles when I made Spaghetti. I'm not a Vegetarian.... Please put in a Refrigerator section.😏</Review>

Got charged $73 for a wine that, on the menu, is listed at $56. Left a tip on top of the 20% SC already included in the bill, then reached out over email when I realized I had been scammed on the wine but nobody bothered to answer.

Food I tried was good and so is service but these issues are for me a deal breaker.</review>

Trendy, sceney Italian spot in the Marina - Pasta comes in two portion sizes but the small is pretty small. Pizza impressed me more! Note the ragu isn't your traditional meat sauce, instead the meat is drained out and just used the flavor the sauce which was a little misleading!< /review>

The RUDEST service I have ever experienced.  I came here to celebrate my friends' engagement and the host could not have been more unhelpful and snooty.  She ultimately was so unhelpful that we ended up foregoing our reservation and eating at a far friendlier Italian establishment across the street.  Yes, the food is good, but so not worth the horrible service.< /Review>

<Review>Pizza is good, but, the staff(George) could be nicer to customers.

I arrived at the store to pick my order up based on the ETA they gave me, but, the order wasn't ready, so, I was standing in the waiting area(with my face mask on and 6ft space), but,
the staff guy(George) was like- "feel free to wait outside"
me: Does it matter if I stand outside or inside as long as I'm  6ft apart?
George: Please wait outside the store.

So, I stepped out of the store and was waiting on the curbside(outside the store), but in the audible distance, so that I can hear when they call my name.

George calls me and tells me that my current curbside location outside the store is not good enough and want me to go further away.

me:???!!!!!

So, I walked  even far from the store on the sidewalk outside and silently stood there for a while and finally got out of there with my order.

Long story short-

1. Be more accurate with the estimated pick up time so that customers don't have to wait in/around the store for the order.

2. When customers are wearing masks and following social distancing, don't TELL them where to stand like they are idiots.

3. Don't be over paranoid with certain customers and be very nice with others. It's easy to misinterpret the behavior for discrimination.

Hope the feedback helps.< /Review><user_name>Shan Valleru</user_name>< Time>

Pizza was fantastic.  Simple fresh ingredients.   Would highly recommend.

Pasta ragu was disappointing.  Sauce did not hold the same simple purity as the pizza. Too oily, could have used a tad more cheese.

Surrau white wine was very nice and easy.
Cappelletti Spritz was a recommendation but was not pleasent to drink.

NOTE: We noticed the other tables were served bread, but we were not offered the same.  Not that we needed, but...   Waitress never asked how our drinks were.  Other service was ok.  Waitress helped with items for building out pizza.

Music was louder than it needed to be, but not so loud you couldn't hear each other.

Would only recommend for the pizza.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6z_WHVvS3JH6P79xO0I1vOtU31vM0riGuoAht=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaBwOgvRjaF0Qo5e9aJZr6SEC_rPOfvZT9_xdx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4PZ4fkDS2V3gZIo3ln8eN1QysppstBOSJ1kuW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Went here for an early valentines date and was not disappointed. To date the best meal I’ve had in SF (been here just under a year). The appetizer salad was phenomenal, the pomegranate touch was beautiful. The main pasta dish was out of this world, some unassuming looking pasta with tomato sauce tasted beautifully homemade (the pasta homemade too), with a perfect amount of saltiness, to die for. Also the pizza was amazing, we got the mushroom. Plans to go back?... no doubt about it. Actually next week.< /Text>

Pizza was less than average (cheese didn't taste like anything), the truffle and the mushroom pizzas are practically the same, but the truffle costs +10 dollars. Our order took around 40 minutes do get ready. Waitress seemed stressed when collecting our party's cards (but payment was efficient). Second star is for the amazing diet cola from an underground brand that I really liked.</Text>

Wow, everything we ate was so good. I had the fried gnudi and meatballs for apps. Both were great. The meatballs in particular were delicious, uniquely prepared, with a bit of a crisp outside.< /text>

Good quality pizza, prepared with fresh ingredients and definitely worth trying.

I personally found it slightly overcooked though and as a result the crust was a bit too dry and not as soft as I would expect from a "pizza napoletana".

The espresso was really great.</text><name>Gabriele Ginella< /name>< pictures>

We ordered the "Meateor 2.0" large deep dish pizza through postmates for delivery. It was almost a $50 pizza after all the fees, delivery fees, and tip. Wow. The deep dish itself was pretty good. It had an okay amount of meat. I liked the abundance of tomato sauce. The crust was fine. The leftovers also reheated well. I'll probably skip the whole delivery process in the future.</Review>

This place is so charming I just had to write a review.  The back space is great for a private party.  The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  But, I just can't get over the charm of this place.

Just wonderful.</Review>

"Pizza at the counter at A-16" has become one of our favorite early dinners when we can get out of the house early enough to get a spot at either the kitchen counter or the bar.  The menu is pricey, even by San Francisco standards, but the experience makes it worthwhile - as their time allowss, engage the bartender or waitstaff on the food and wine and their passion will pour forth in a mix of education and entertainment. Well worth the cost of admission, so to speak.< /text>

Never in my life reviewed anything but: there was this guy who I think is the waiters and waitresses manager (short hair, white, sour-looking) that was extremely passive aggressive to me when I asked if we could order our food. That I don't really mind, but when a doordash delivery guy asked him for the food he was so extremely rude that I found it very disturbing. I cannot excuse treating service people badly under any circumstance. And if you despise people so much... Why work in the restaurant industry it all?</Text>

<text>Phenomenal. We have been meaning to go here and this will definitely turn into a regular stop for the marina/cow hollow. Fresh everything, from house pizza dough to trout and sumchokes. Lots of wood fire and it shines through. A phenomenal Italian wine list that isn't focused on just Tuscany and Piedmont (in fact, did I see either?).
Please go here.< /text>< GmapID>

Citrus salad was a rip off at 16$ for basically maybe slightly less than an orange cut up on a plate with some salt and olive oil.  Clams were also a rip at 22$ for what was a weak sized portion of something that should have been 12$ at most places.  Really not worth the experience to cut my own soggy pizza up.  I won't be revisiting this place.  No offense to servers, but the product just isn't worth it!</text>

Service, food, and surroundings are nice. Music can be a bit loud depending on where you are seated, however the staff is happy to adjust music level on request. A little dark for my liking although some may find it romantic. Staff is excellent at pairing (extensive)wines with particular courses offered. An easy place to return to for an excellent changing menu.</review>

<Text>We came here for wines and dinner and ended up leaving after one wine. The guy at the bar was not attentive and laughed at us when we asked what wine he recommended. He didn’t seem interested. It made the experience really disappointing as the wine we ended up having was actually really good. The other bar tender was new and we felt sorry for her as it seemed like a difficult job with no culture or support from the other guy. This place looked so good from the outside and we are locals and were really hoping for more. Hope it improves and they can find better staff.< /Text>< username>

Last night (March 8) my friend and I enjoyed an absolutely delightful dinner at A16. Everything we ordered off the specials menu was fantastic. Our server, Natalia, was very charming and provided excellent recommendations of wine. All the specials were created by women chefs in honor of international women’s day. We started off with a truly remarkable chicory salad with a date vinaigrette, almonds, pickled onions and ricotta salata. Then we thoroughly enjoyed the corona bean salad with thyme vinaigrette and red onion. It is not an over statement to say these beans were life changing. Who knew a simple bean could be elevated to such a level? Props to the chef! Lastly, we shared the burrata pizza with carrot top pesto, carrot, walnuts and green garlic. They should seriously consider making those beans and the burrata pizza staples on their menu. Everyone around us was remarking on how fabulous both dishes were, we had two separate people recommend the pizza before we even sat down! I can’t wait to return and hope A16 incorporates some of these new dishes on their menu soon.<//Text>

A number of years ago, I used to come here regularly. We used to sit at the counter in the back, have a salad and pizza each; my wife would have a drink or two and maybe we had a little dessert for around $90 with tip. The food was good, the people were friendly, and the service was excellent.  I took a friend to lunch today, my first visit in several years. The people are still friendly, the service excellent , and the food is good. So  what keeps them from getting 5 stars instead of the 4 I gave them (and in truth it would have been 3 1/2 if there were such a choice)? I was hungry, so I ordered a large portion of pasta. It was $28 and was barely as large as a side order someplace else. To give them their due though, I have to say  it was excellent! Mercifully, the bread was "free" or I would have starved. My friend had a prosciutto board and a glass of rose wine. We split an arugula salad. With tip, the tab was $120. I walked away hungry, and unfortunately I won't be going back. I can't afford a $120 lunch that leaves me wanting another entree! What would it really cost them to throw another handful of pasta in the bowl? Seriously.</text>

Great ambiance, attentive staff, wonderful food. The wine list is extensive and thoughtfully prepared, with good prices for a restaurant on this level. We received good wine advice from our server, too! All in all, an incredible evening of food and wine. Could not have asked for a more enjoyable meal!<//Text>

Fantastic pizza, great service. You have the option to sit and see the open kitchen and how they cook! Very great night out!</text>

This place is great. We were two people and shared a gem salad, a pizza, a small pasta (you can get two serving sizes of the pastas), a main with pork and two desserts. A good amount for two moderately hungry people. Their selection of wine is huge. The food is amazing and their waiters are so nice and friendly. We had such a good time and will definitely be back.<//Text>

The service was sub par.  The taste of the food was 4 out of 5. I had the steak, meatball soup, and a pizza.  I did not like the vibe in the restaurant.  Over priced for the experience. What I did like was sitting by the kitchen watching the cooks.  The pizza was 3 out of 5.
Overall 3 stars.< /review>

<Review>We had a reservation for 9:45pm on Valentine’s Day. We showed up a bit early but they sat us immediately. The place was decked out in red and white balloons for Valentine’s Day which was a nice touch. The tables were all decorated with red cloth and sequins which was also a nice touch (minus the sequins which my girlfriend didn’t love).

We had the burrata which was below average, sadly. We also had the fungi pizza which I was pleased with.

I’m giving 3 stars based on service, which was bad. We ordered a bottle of wine. At the initial taste, we both we’re visibly not crazy about the wine, but the waiter said nothing and just turned around and left. Second, they forgot about our burrata order and only brought it out after we asked about it because the pizza had come out first. They offered to comp the burrata but of course at the end it was still on the bill (they removed it after we brought it up). Finally, the service and attention at our table was overall lacking. I don’t really like overly attentive waiting, but this waiter was hardly ever around.

I’m sure the staff was overworked and exhausted by the time we got there at the end of Valentine’s Day, but I don’t think that’s an excuse for poor service.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I was so excited about this restaurant that I picked it for my mom’s birthday, reserved a month in advance, and in the reservation I asked for a surprise birthday dessert. It was definitely the worst experience.
1) we ordered all the recommendations - the gnocchi were FROZEN inside, and they happened to be my mom’s dish. The rest of the order (salmon tartare, pizza, pasta) were at best mediocre.
2) we had to ask several waiters many times to get water refills.
3) needless to say, the dessert never arrived.

Worst birthday dinner ever. We had to go to a second restaurant to make up for this disappointing experience.</Text>

I have been to eat here several times. I always receive top notch service and have a wonderful experience. The pizza is, in my opinion, the best Neapolitan style pizza in San Francisco, and maybe the Bay Area. The staff have introduced me to some great wines. I have probably tried half of the food on the menu and it was all outstanding. Friendly neighborhood and tourist crowd, high quality ingredients, very clean, very welcoming and accessible. I have had a few special occasions here and we were always treated to a completely memorable time.< /text>

After around 8 visits, I won’t be going
back.  Our experiences have been wildly inconsistent in terms of food, service, and ambiance.  We’ve had good (never great) meals, and really bland ones.   Portion sizes are tiny relative to price.   The wine list is excellent but expensive.  Service can be excruciatingly slow, and on busy nights sloppy, forgetful, and brusque.  Any time it is busy it is deafeningly loud - to the level of being unable to carry in a conversation.  Last night we were seated a full half hour after our reservation with little apology.  On the positive side, when we’ve gone there very early (6pm) it’s been calm and not as loud - but still with inattentive service.<//text>

I am beginning to wonder if A-16 has their employees write reviews. The last couple of times I was there the food was good...but overpriced for a neighborhood restaurant, and the bartender has so much attitude you feel like he's doing you a favor by helping you. Last time I was there I brought my own bottle of wine. A corkage fee is expected...but $30 ...a little over the top. It's more like a penalty fee. All in all ....there are better places in walking distance.<//Text>

One person in my group had some allergies, and the waitress was not judgmental but also went out of her way to mark out everything that has nuts and dairy in it. She was prompt and very knowledgeable about the menu. The food was great, and the whole experience was very nice!</text>

The waiter was very rude, like if he didn’t want us there because we had a 22 pm reservation and it closes at 23 , but we order pretty quick, I’m sure it’s not the restaurant fault, other wise they wouldn’t be taking reservations at that time . So the food was ok, they didn’t have us any bread that we saw other tables were having for free ,we had pizza, very fresh ingredients, a lot of aroma from the basil and the dough wasn’t the lightest but very good, the pasta wasn’t so good though, very bitter ragu, don’t know why but it was expensive for what it was , had a lot better for a lot less $$$ we went there because it was like 100 best ??? Not at all. Will never recomend and never go back</text>

Best pizza ever! Secret menu item "The Widowmaker" is amazing. Ask your server about it.

The meatballs are pricey, but excellent. Only on Monday's I think.

Fantastic Wine List

Stopped in while visiting SF for Fleet Week. Fabulous food, wine,  and pairing of dessert wines.  Attention to details of foods, flavors and service.
Straight up awesome! Definitely a repeat next time in SF.</Text>

<Review>What a wonderful place! We went for lunch with my husband, mum and my 2 year old. We were welcomed warmly and had a really tasty and filling lunch. A separate fresh pasta meal was prepared for my boy, which he really enjoyed. Just wish it was closer to my home town as they have a Turkish night, including belly dancing later on this month. Will definitely be visiting again :)</Review><user_name>Amber Randall</user_name>< response>

The food here is out of this world. The pizza was so fresh and it comes with scissors to cut it yourself, which I think is a really cool touch. The pasta was delicious and perfectly cooked. They also have an extremely extensive wine menu with wines from all different regions. The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgable. Definitely worth the price.< /text>

Had a great evening meal here. We arrived quite late and so didn't have any wait. We sat at the chef counter in the rear area of the restaurant. This spot provided us with the ideal place to watch the chefs work. It was fascinating (and we felt exhausted on their behalf!) We had been advised to order the pizza which we did. The pizza was cooked perfectly in the wood fired oven in front of our seats and the ratio of toppings was perfect (many places over-sauce etc). I'd advise to stick to wine to drink though as all of the beers were canned. The wine list is pretty good and offers bottles over a wide price range, so ordering from there is no hardship.</Text>

It was a nice experience to view and explore the Ontario attractions! The journey through Can Ar Coach Services has made it really marvelous and unforgettable. I got amazed while seeing their facilities insider the bus and the staffs really friendly and interactive. Ontario bus tours through their coach were excellent and memorable. I am going to refer to this great coach team to all my friends and relatives who also want to make such a memorable tour.</Text>

Great food, though a little on the pricey side. Had the mushroom pizza, if you are a mushroom lover, I highly recommend, but by the end of it even I was a bit mushroomed out! Would go back though, very tasty, but would probably take more variety of things to compliment each other. Nice wine selection too.< /review>

Dined there recently, beside the great food and how they accommodated for my Son’s nut allergies, I accidentally left my credit card behind.   When I contacted them they indeed confirmed that they had locked it away and I was able to pick it up the following day without issue.  Thanks you</Review>

I can't remember the name of the pizza. But it had anchovies on it & a salad in the middle. I was bomb! I really wished I lived closer I would be enjoying their food and company at least once a week!</Text>

I love A16.  I enjoy sitting at the bar watching them construct and bake my pizza.  They really know how to pair their wines with their foods.  I have taken many out of town visitors here and it has always turned a regular meal into a great memory.  You can dress semi-casual or dress up a little and you will fit in just fine, and I would not try to go in with shorts and flip flops though (just saying that because I saw that happen once and it looked awkward for that guy).<//Review>

To be honest the food is quite delicious, but service quite a bit lacking. We had reservations for 7:30; was still waiting around at 8pm - and the snooty hostess was less than helpful. The pasta is very fresh and the quality of the ingredients come through. Good wine list. The takeaway - last year's prom queen seems a bit faded.< /Review>

<review>Their price-to-portion ratio is completely out-of-whack. $16 for a dish of 3 mini-meatballs (sized like your tv dinner) with a pool basil sauce and nothing else, not even beans or veggies. Spent another $16 on a dish of mini-pasta, again with nothing else. So I spent $32 and I walked away hungry. No wonder they are dead on a Saturday afternoon. I should have noticed before walking in. I'm leaving this review to remind myself to never go back to this blood sucking place again.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I have never had such a great experience interacting with bar staff. These guys were great not only were their drinks well made they were personable and the music choice was top notch.
Wonderful way to round out a weekend, if you're visiting Portland or a local cruising downtown for a bar, this place is a must (at least once).
Props and love to the Leaky Roof! <3<//review>

<Text>Just good now - but because of simple but tasty vegetable dishes.
It is not at all what it used to be years ago. Was in on evening of 4/15/2018 and server was ok to poor. Lacking knowledge of dishes and ingredients. She didn't know what was the primary ingredient on a topping on a dish. Never asked how anything was over 3 courses. Fine for a diner but far from someone working a place like this.
Dessert - strawberry, rhubarb on scone/muffin sort of thing was terrible. Very dry, lacking in flavor, no signs of rhubarb or strawberry other than a faint aftertaste. We asked to add a scoop of vanilla gelato because otherwise it wasn't edible.
In other words, good but no longer excellent. Lot's of options so my recommendation would be to try something fresher.</Text>< Pictures>

This is where you get great Italian cooking in San Francisco. It's got a friendly neighborhood vibe with unpretentious classics on the menu. The salciccia is my favorite pizza and I would highly suggest getting at least 1 per person, depending on how hungry you will get.<//review>

A small, upscale Italian bistro that takes reservations with a lively bar scene for the cognescenti. Plates are fabulously prepared with local ingredients and complementary tastes perfectly paired. The menu changes weekly but you can always order a favorite off-menu. Service (and atmosphere) is casual and above average at making you feel welcome.< /text>

We would give our experience a better score than great if it were possible.  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  With the salesman there was zero pressure to buy anything, we didn't feel as though we were being "sold".   It was a very natural process which was so refreshing!  We will absolutely recommend Carbiz and become repeat customers.<//review>

Truthfully, I could have skipped the pizza. It was good...bordering fine. The real stars for me were the antipasti and the desserts. If the ricotta cheesecake is on the menu, be sure to save room for it!< /Text>

<text>Mr recent experience as an emergency room client, transferred to inpatient, was excellent.  I was in acute distress; I not only received immediate care, but also continuing comfort and care for my well-being throughout my extended stay.  I was treated with the greatest courtesy and dignity.  I wish to express my gratitude and thanks for your wonderful kindness, care and service.  I also observed that others received the same courteous, thoughtful care that I did;  my excellent care was the rule, not the exception.  Thank you, everyone, at Marlborough Hospital for making a difficult time for me easier to bear and for your continuing support and help in my recovery.  Marlborough Hospital is a fantastic resource for our community!< /text><Rating>4</Rating>< resp>

Great pizza in a fun atmosphere. The crust has a great chew and the pizza has the smokiness that comes from a wood-fired oven. Really enjoyed it. House-made chili oil is a must-try for fans of heat.< /Review>

Everyone was warm and extremely welcoming. The dentist and staff were diligent in explaining all procedures as well as answering any questions I had. I felt very comfortable here which is rare when visiting the dentist. Dental procedures can often be quite costly, however they are willing to work with you and figure out what works best for your budget and are not pushy in any way.</review>

Amazing! We´re visiting Italy about five times a year - especially Napoli – and feel like we can really rate Pizza. This Pizza is one of the best Pizzas we had so far. Mind blowing dough meets amazing ingredients on the top. If you wish to taste the “gusto di napoli” come to this awesome place!< /Review>

Jerry W. Swartz, of Mobile PC Doctors does an outstanding job technically and efficiently.  He makes a special effort to reply to any problems that you may be having with your computer in a swift and timely manner.  He is always patient and takes the time to explain to you what the problem is that you are having at the time. In short, he has great work ethic and gives exceptional customer service. I would recommend his services to anyone that is having computer problems.<//review>

<username>Daniele Perretta< /username><text>I went there to try their pizza, as this place is listed as member of VPN Americas, and I expected a high quality pizza.
The place is nice, with a bar near the main entrance and a nice room for people interested in tasting food. They feature an 'open kitchen', which I like in general.
I ordered a Margherita. Pizza looked good and the tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil were fresh, but the pizza dough had a yeasty taste.
The beer I ordered was local, a good IPA, but it was canned.
Considering that the place was not busy, the service was just OK. When the pizza was ready, it stayed there, waiting to be served, for almost two minutes. It might seem nothing, but to me pizza has to be served as soon as possible (read "immediately").
Prices for the pizza and desserts are very high.
Overall, I give it a three star only because the place is nice and their menu looks great and has a lot of other choices. For such a high price I'd expect a superb pizza and an excellent service, however they were nothing exceptional. I won't go back</text></record>

A16 is the best of the Marina. The food is good, the wine list is great. Downside: it's fully booked almost every night, and parking is tough.

That said, with 72 hours notice, you can still get a table.</text>

Amateur service at the bar. Bartenders whipping each other with bar towels while ignoring customers. Bartenders not particularly knowledgeable or willing to help in wine selection. The food was, as always, top notch. But bar experience left us feeling we were dining at a fraternity party.<//Text>

<text>We ordered the escarole salad, the Salsiccia pizza, the broccoli raab, and the pork chop. Good amount of food for two. We sat at the counter and wanted our pizza get made. Lovely service by a Scottish or Irish guy. Can't remember exactly.</text>< pictures>

My elderly friend had finished her whole meal long before we got our entre's. We were very late for the movie across the street.

The place is dark and gloomy and the high stools are very uncomfortable. The food was good but NOT worth the hassles (which I don't have time to describe in depth.).One big thing was lack of communication between the front of the house and the back.</text>< Pics>

I have purchased several cars from these guys and everyone of them has been exactly what the add represented them to be.   Great group of guys to deal with.  They where always available when I had questions, and I found their prices to be more than fair.  I'd buy from them again.</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>The salad that I ordered was bad from the beginning.  The greens were wilted and some were even reddening from being left out too long.  I only ate a small bit and was sick for almost two days.
The decor looks like they raided souvenir shops across the west.  The whole place was dated. Dusty, old, and a bit dingy.  It does have potential though.  The bar area is the best part.
The service was pretty good.  Our waitress was attentive and very nice.  I wish, however, that she would have warned me what not to get.
This place needs an overhaul.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Still great after all these years. I find the pizza dough a little salty, but the burrata, the meatballs and the pasta are all really outstanding. It's a warm and comfortable place that does not disappoint.<//text>

< Review>
Not a good experience. We felt very unwelcome and the service was rushed and unfriendly. Plates slamed onto the table by staff members rushing by.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the pizza and seafood pasta was good. The other two pasta dishes were tiny portions of dried out and luke warm slop. We sent one back.  Heard great things from hotel staff about this place. I updated them with our very disappointing experience.</Review>

Crazy loud, tables are stuffed super close together, waiters and waitresses are given more tables then they can handle. They never refill your water, the pasta is good but not great for the price, the pizza was fine. I think this place is popular because it’s in a good neighborhood but when you can’t hear the person talking that you brought to dinner... is it really worth it?</review>

<Text>Darling decor although the smells would have done it for me alone.  I didn't have a reservation so a friend and I ordered pizzas in the front area.  Excellent thin crusts with delicately melted cheese and flagrant sauce.  Definitely going to make a reservation next time.
Also looked good for groups, planned in advance of course.  I was very jealous of a long table of 10 mangia-ing in the back.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>A go to place for me and my girlfriend for a date night or a place to show friends that come to visit.  We love the service and atmosphere.  They have a good selection of wines with knowledgable people to help you pick one.  We typically order a couple of pasta dishes with a pizza and that is enough delicious food to satisfy for a great evening.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I really wanted to dock a star for them not seating us until 15 minutes after our reservation, or for feeling not rich and white enough to eat there.

However, after we sat down and got our food, all was forgotten. It was simply amazing - every course of our meal was fantastic.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Delicious, authentic Italian pizza. Our server could have been a lot more cheerful. I wouldn't recommend sharing the bruschetta; it comes with one piece of bread. Disappointed that they don't have any beers on tap (only bottled).</Review>

<review>The food is mediocre at best.
Pasta is watery. Steak was burned to a charcoal, asked well done. Pizza was over salted and none of the food was filling. Not to mention a hair in the pasta and the waiter acted like it was normal. Avoid<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>This is to say just how pleased I was with the service from Reid.  By my verbal description Reid presented to me the exact furniture design appropriate for my beach house.  Reid was more than professional, she spoke to me as if she were my sister.  She knew me from the moment I walked in the Mor Furniture show room.  She was superiorly helpful in every way.  Reid, Thank You for your help.</review>< Rate>

Being 15 min late they cancelled the reservation even if we called earlier. They have us wait with people who didn't reserve. The girl was rude.

<Text>What great little place to satisfy your hunger without a fast food feel to it. There seems to be low employee turnover here because if you frequent this place often enough the staff will begin to greet you by name. The service is above and beyond. The person I was having lunch with thought they messed up his order not bringing him fries. Turns out he was who was mistaken and the restaurant brought him out fries anyway - free of charge. I highly recommend the Mushroom Swiss Char with Sweet Potato fries. Lunch for two came to $19.63 : 5/5 overall</Text>< Pics>

<Review>this used to be our favorite place, with great music and great food, but a change of ownership has completely changed the place.  The workers (bartenders, waitresses, etc.) act like they own the place and feel like they can treat customers anyway they want.  I promisesd to never come back, but gave them a second chance and the experience got even worse.  It went from one of the best hidden gems of charlotte to a place i wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  It hurts to say this, but until another change occurs, I will never even mention the name of this establishment, much less visit it.  Do yourself a favor and never even consider eating or drinking here.<//Review>< rate>

<text>Robbie McCorkle was great! My wife was looking for a F150 Ford in our area we live it. We just con't find one with the color, year and price. She looked on line and found one at Young Ford. We talked to Robbie he got us what we wanted so we made the 190 mile trip to buy it. The truck was parked out front and we was out the door with the price he quoted over the phone. Robbie took the time to go over the truck with us and was truly friendly man. Thanks Robbie and if we or any one we know needs a Ford we will give you a call.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808580d439568613:0x25052d08a2414fb0< /gmapID></record>

Horribly slow service and bad food.  The server got our orders wrong and it took over 45 minutes for the food to be brought out- not a good time frame for a 1:45 lunch when the restaurant is only half full.  Both pannini's came out cold, like they had been sitting somewhere for a while.  Sent the food back to the kitchen and, 15 minutes later, finally got it back, but it was way overcooked and tasteless.

I've been to this restaurant before and had good service and food, so this may have been a fluke.  But it was bad enough to make me think twice about returning.  Consider Pastini or California Pizza Kitchen instead- both have better service and better food.<//Text>

great italian place if you are ever in the marina. it is always crowded so be sure to make a reservation. large wine selection and a lively front bar area. make sure you go on monday for Meatball Monday Night. Their pizzas are excellent too. make sure you add on burrata cheese.<//Text>

love, love, love this place.  it's noisy and cramped but if you can make it through the crowds that fall out the door (and can hear yourself think through the noise), you're in for an evening of perfectly sublime rustic italian fare, punctuated by friendly but perfect service.  focus on local and fresh foods.  a word of warning:  waits for seatings (even with a reservation) can be incredibly long, but it's truly worth the wait.< /Text>

It is a nice cozy restaurant with an intimate ambiance. The food is good for fish-eatarians, not so much for vegetarians. Servers are hoity-toity, but you expect that at a French place. Leave time to hunt around for parking since the place is splat in the middle of downtown.< /Text>

The squid ink pasta was really good. They also gave us a caramel gelato complimentary for some reason. Although the fig crostata could have been less sweet it went really well with the fennel gelato it is served with.</review>

Worst experience ever. The doormen may let you in according to his mood. If he is not in good mood he will not let you in without any reason. Same attitude with bar tenders, they treat customers like crap. Never ever gonna go again.<//Text>

Techtotal provided me with the knowledge and skills I needed to take my career to the next level!
Their one on one tutoring ensures that students get the attention they need to develop quickly. I found that the support and guidance was always there and they were more than willing to help me with any questions I had along the way.
The Instructional Design program engaged all elements I expected and more. From technical writing and the ADDIE model to elearning tools, I was more than equipped to take on today’s ID challenges. This is the best value for your money hands down!

Another fun restaurant in the Marina, good food, good service and goood decor. I love their pizzas, they re filling without being too heavy. Nice spot for a fun thursday night, gets very busy on weekends. Make sure you get there early on a saturday, people watching is rewarding as well!</text>

< Review>
Pizza Romana - where are the anchovies?? a scant sprinkling of black olives. 95% tomato and garlic in terms of taste, little else. Very disappointing $14

Fettucine - A cheesy film coats the pasta. Where is the rest of this dish? Basically just pasta and little else - Very disappointing $20

Italian is my favourite food type. Experienced it in Italy many times. This place is so mean with the non-carb ingredients, as it were. Am surprised it was busy.</Review>

I have been following and big fan of Shelley Lindgren (A16 - Owner/Wine Director) for a while now. While I have dined at her SPQR restaurant, I only got a chance to dine at A16 about a year ago. As expected, the food of Campania and the amazing wine list did not disappoint! Proud of you Shelley, Cheers to your drive and love of good food and vino!<//text>

Ooooh pizza. Deelish pizza and the shishito pepper appetizer is nothing to turn your nose up at either. Love this place, even though it's in, ahem, the Marina.<//Review>

AAMCO has the absolute best customer service.  As a female, we tend not to want to deal with auto problems.  Glen and his staff were so professional and went way out of their way to assist me with my rebuilt transmission needs.  They had my vehicle towed for me to the shop and held onto it until a decision could be made on how to handle the issues.  Then they did an excellent job, and I was able to get my vehilce back within a week.  I couldn't have asked for a nicer group of people to work with.  No matter what car issues I have in the future, I will be sure to use AAMCO.< /Review>

We started with the burrata and acqua pazza, which were excellent choices! We were told we got the last acqua pazza, which was delicious--served in a spicy tomato based broth with all of the seafoods--I would call it a "must-have."  The burrata may be the best I've had to date, largely because (i) it was served at the perfect temperature (room) (ii) with a very high-quality olive oil and a hint of saltiness... yum!  We ordered extra bread so we could sop up every last drop of broth and olive oil, sooooo goood!< /Text>

All Star Bartending is a great investment, you'l make the money back quick and its only 2 weeks worth of school at most. Its a friendly atmosphere and the the Instructor is a licensed bartender and knows what he is talking about. You will work in a bartending setting before even graduating. Excellent school, very worth it.<//review>

The salad was excellent.  The bread was good but sliced too thin.  The butter was melted.  I had chicken picattta and it was not served the traditional way in pounded medallions, breaded with a light lemon/caper sauce.  It was served with fat chicked breasts and a tart sauce.  The mashed potatoes served with it were bland.  I suggest that they use a garlic red skinned mashed potato product.  The cannoli's pastry was too tough but the service was outstanding.

Came here on a Friday group as a group of 4. We had an 8:00 reservation and we were seating immediately. The place was bigger than expected inside and it seemed fairly busy and bustling.

We started with a bottle of white wine at the recommendation of our waitress. That was where the good service ended, though. Once we asked for bread and chili oil, we started getting some serious attitude, as if those requests were incredibly demanding and outlandish. Thank goodness the food was good. The bread was fluffy but had some heavier flavors, almost like olive, to it. I couldn't get enough of it. The chili oil was perfectly spicy, more so than expected, and was perfect on the bread, pizza crust, and basically everything.

We started with the salumi, the burrata, and the summer squash salad. The salumi had three types of meat, an 'nduja served on bread, a prosciutto, and some kind of loaf style meat. The last one was my least favorite, but the other two were really good, especially the 'nduja. The burrata was perfectly creamy with sea salt on top, and I could have eaten this for days. I didn't try the bread that was served with it, as I prefer soft bread to toast, but the cheese was just awesome. The squash summer salad was light and refreshing and perfect for the sunny day we had Friday. The pecorino on top added a nice creamy factor, and the squash and other veggies were flavorful and crispy without being heavy. The olives added good substance and fat without weighing down the salad, and the mint tasted just like summer.

We ordered a bottle of red wine and two pizzas, the salsiccia and the funghi. Both were good, the funghi was better, but neither was outstanding. The spring onion on the salsiccia was overwhelming but the mushrooms on the funghi were well cooked and the flavors all went together nicely. Oddly, the pizzas were served completely uncut with a pair of scissors. While I appreciate being able to cut slices to your own size, it was messy and would have been nice to get at least a light pre-cutting.

For four of us, with tax and tip, we each paid about $55. While I enjoyed the meal, it wasn't as awesome as I wanted it to be, especially the pizzas. I'd like to come back and try some more of the small plates, but I probably won't be running back.</review>

Specializes in Southern Italian food, from the Campania/Basilicata/Puglia regions along highway A16 that connects Naples and Bari.

I've eaten here several times, and each time it's a treat: almost everything is good here, so you can't go wrong.  (I know this cuisine, since I lived in Naples for 2 years and founded a website, Wikinapoli, about food, etc. in that region).

I prefer the pizzas at Tony's in North Beach, but A16's are one of the better "Naples-style" pizzas in SF.

Tip: don't miss the chocolate budino dessert!< /review>

Our server acted like he was doing us a favor and was pretty much nonexisitant throughout the meal (saw him having a smoke on the way out).  Food was marginal at best and very overpriced.  Great wine list but I will never go back there.< /text><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x808580d439568613:0x25052d08a2414fb0<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Stevinson Toyota East - Aurora, Colorado
After 12 years of faithful service from my Saturn, it was time to upgrade my transportation.  I had bought American cars in the past but, when I discovered that 7  local Toyota dealerships had contributed 5 million dollars to the Denver Zoo (at which I volunteer),I needed to rethink my consumer position.  I chose Stevinson Toyota East because it is one of the seven DZ contributing dealerships, it is conveniently located, and it offers hybrid vehicles with proven reliability.
It was by good luck that Jeremy Young was my salesperson. He was calm and patient as I asked many questions.   He didn't hesitate to include the general manager in our discussions about availability and pricing. I felt very confident and comfortable in making this large financial investment with this group of professionals.
Elyce Hurd introduced me to the many features of my new Prius v.  She was very professional and friendly as she set up my Bluetooth connection and walked me through some of the idiosyncrasies of my Prius v.
I would wholeheartedly recommend Stevinson Toyota East.  I would wholeheartedly recommend working with Jeremy Young.<//review>

I was a little disappointed in A16. The food was good, not great, and for those prices I expect some creativity and exceptionalism in the food quality. Clearly it is a neighborhood place to go since it was packed.< /text>

lousy unapologetic service.  if you ignore repeated requests for water, bring the main courses before we're done with the appetizers, and botch the order, you've earned your $2 tip.</review>

(Translated by Google) A slightly different pizza with a special taste. Do the spices, herbs? Simply delicious! Also unique is the served scissors, with which the pizza can be cut. 👍

(Original)
Eine etwas andere Pizza mit besonderem Geschmack. Machen das die Gewürze, Kräuter? Einfach lecker! Außerdem einmalig die dazu servierte Schere, mit der die Pizza geschnitten werden kann. 👍</review>

(Translated by Google) It's a nice restaurant. I was really kind of you. From the first place to the order, I was kind enough to guide you kindly. I was so upset about the American tip culture and I asked the waiter. Not to mention the taste of the pizza that is baked right in front of you!

(Original)
멋진 식당입니다. 정말 친절해요 ㅋㅋ처음 자리잡을때부터 주문까지 정말 친절히 안내해주시고 미국 팁 문화에 대해 서툴러서 웨이터 분께 물어봤는데 귀찮게 생각안하고 정말 친절하게 얘기해줬습니다. 바로 눈앞에서 화덕에 구워주는 피자맛은 말할것도 없고요!</Text>

(Translated by Google) I was on a business trip ... Well first of all ... book! From 18.18.30 we have dinner and, despite the size of the restaurant. It's always full ... Medium high with good wine selection .. Just bring it ... Maybe a little noisy when it fills up ... Expensive!

(Original)
Sono stato durante un viaggio di lavoro... Beh innanzitutto... prenotate! Dalle 18.18.30 si cena e, nonostante la dimensione del locale.  È sempre pieno... Medio alto con buona selezione di vini.. Portate giuste... Forse un po' rumoroso quando si riempie... Expensive!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) At a temperature of 13 ° C outside, the door is left open throughout, so guests with jacket sit in the restaurant.
The service was good, but with the price I expect a much better meal.
In the local it is extremely loud!

(Original)
Bei einer Temperatur von 13°C draußen wird die Tür durchgängig offen gelassen, sodass die Gäste mit Jacke im Restaurant sitzen.
Der Service war gut, bei dem Preis erwarte ich aber ein deutlich besseres Essen.
Im Lokal ist es extrem laut!</Text>

(Translated by Google) Ual! What a hidden and nice place. If you go to the Palace of Fine Arts you can walk. The price is fair for the quality. We ate the pizza and we loved it.

<text>(Translated by Google) From violent dough
Excellent Italian restaurant
Sit on the chef's counter
Ate: the hummus soup and scallops I ate for starters, the beef and ricotta patties and the delectable chocolate tart.
Food comes fast and service is excellent. Worth every cent. Mandatory Mandatory.

(Original)
מתוך בצק אלים
מסעדה איטלקית מעולה
לשבת על ה-chef's counter
אכלו: מרק החומוס והצדפות שאכלתי למנה ראשונה , קציצות הבקר והריקוטה וטארט השוקולד המתעתע.
אוכל מגיע מהר והשירות מעולה. שווה כל סנט. חובה חובה חובה.</text><userid>103120741386433803107< /userid><Name>Yaara Guetta-Weidberg<//Name><GmapID>0x808580d439568613:0x25052d08a2414fb0<//GmapID>< Date>
