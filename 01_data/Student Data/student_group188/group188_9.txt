<Text>Doctor Morshedi has been my dentist for the past 20 years and I would not trust anyone else with my dental health. She and her staff are very caring, professional and always up-to-date on the latest technology. Her dental assistant, John, has been with her for some time and is very thorough and comfortable during the exams and cleanings. I highly recommend Doctor Morshedi for any dental needs.<//Text>< pictures>

Dr. Morshedi and her assistant, John, are the best. They are super-friendly, thoughtful and do great, meticulous work. I've been a patient of Dr. Morshedi's for close to two decades now. I've mainly gone in for cleanings but have had some other minor work done — i.e., replacing old fillings.</text>

<text>I have been going to this dentist for 15+ years and they have always been so friendly and professional. When I first came to the SF Bay Area, I tried lots of other dentists that I really didn’t like. I am so glad to have found them. My wife goes there too. We’ve moved a few times but we have kept our dentist.<//text>< Pics>

They are caring, thorough, extremely responsive, do excellent dental work, and basically take care of all my needs and my family’s needs. We’ve used them for years and hope to do so for the foreseeable future!</Text><name>Edna Wallace</name><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5<//rating></record>

Dr. Morshedi, John, & Catherine all do a great job of making everyone feel welcome while also giving some of the best dental care I've ever received.
Catherine is always a step ahead of any insurance issues and makes every phone call or step in the door feel like you're interacting with family. With Catherine doing as much work on the paperwork side in advance and the efficient working relationship between Dr. Morshedi & John, I'm often in-and-out in 30 minutes for a cleaning.
Make no mistake, though, I've never felt rushed. After a warm welcome from Catherine, she or John start the visit off with a warm and scented neck pillow. The little niceties keep coming through the procedure itself with glasses to help block the bright light of the overhead lamp.
If they have to do any drilling, they offer a radio and headphones to help block that shrilling noise. I found even more comfort in realizing how up to date Dr. Morshedi stays on dental technologies. It sucks to have to get a filling re-done, but, dang it, it was so cool to see her take a 3D image of my mouth and then walk right down the hall to get my new filling off her printer.
Finally, whether it is a standard cleaning or another procedure, the cherry, er, maybe lavender on top, is a fresh lavender-scented towel to wipe off your face. After a quick stop with Catherine to schedule your next appointment, you're out the door feeling calmer than when you stepped through it.< /text>

We have been with Dr Morshedi for more than 10 years now. She is always wants
to “make the right decision to protect your teeth 🦷”  not aggressive, unless needed.
And if needed she has a great network for orthodontist and specialists.</Review>

<user_id>110133623010367356407< /user_id><Text>Dr. Morshedi runs an excellent practice and is thorough with her cleanings and dental examinations. She catches problems early and any follow up care is usually available within a week or two. She goes to great lengths to provide excellent care while minimizing any discomfort. She and her staff of John and Catherine are all affable yet professional and always welcoming. Even without insurance the out of pocket cost for preventative care is worth it in my opinion.</Text>< Rating>

The team here is amazing. Very kind, professional, and patient.
I developed a fear of the dentist after a bad experience getting my wisdom teeth taken out when I was 20. Their calm environment and mannerisms really helped ease my anxiety.
I have moderate to severe TMJD and was able to get it treated here. They were extremely helpful with that entire process.<//Text>

It is with great pleasure to praise you for the excellent dental care provided to me and my husband since 2018. Dr. Morshedy and her staff are very professional and welcoming. They follow all the PPE requirements. This is the office I feel safe and trust to go Always and even now with this epidemic situation. Highly recommended.

<Review>Everybody here was fantastic; they know their stuff and really pay attention to the level of service they give.  Anybody can do a filling, but Dr. Morshedi and her staff go the extra mile to make you feel taken care of.<//Review>< pics>

!!WARNING!! If you go here your car might get broken into!!
We went here for lunch in the middle of a sunny ☀️ not busy day in uniform and my brand new car got broke into!! The cameras are fake and it has happened repeatedly at this place!!

The food and service where great but not worth the $500 window and $5,000 of stuff taken from my car!!</text>

I usually order food to go from here (even before COVID) but when I do eat in the restaurant, I tend to order their breakfasts. I always over eat with their build-your-own breakfast, oops! Always comfort food here. I love their nachos, with everything on it. I haven't found better nachos anywhere else in town. The sandwiches are great--my go-to being the turkey club with avocado. Customer service is important and keeps people coming back, especially for me. And with good food, it really is a restaurant I love to support. Ditch that cheap nasty fastfood for actual comfort food! Note: when I'm really lazy, I will order through a third party delivery--everything is always packaged well.< /Review>

Excellent service from Sandy and her mom.
Food is delicious, place is clean, and quiet.
Returned again today for breakfast.
I often enjoy the Florentine Benedict
( ham, spinach, poached egg, tomato (without for me), on an English muffin with hollandaise sauce over it all $11.49)
In my photos you will see:
Reuben-layers of deli corn beef, cheese, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing,  on grilled marbled rye with pickle and fruit $11.49

Eat here frequently.  The food is very good and portions are large.  Reasonable prices. Always great service. Gave 4 stars because the bathrooms do need to be upgraded.</Text>

Food was fantastic!! my gf had the chorizo skillet and it was amazing and I had the 3 egg Benicia grill breakfast and it was A++ the reason I gave 4 stars was the service, took forever to get our coffee refilled and our server didn't bring us any silverware after sitting us and serving us coffee. Other than that small incident it was a great experience and we will be back. 😎< /review>

Excellent service and food quality.
The best breakfast ever.
Babs by delta in suisun is nothing compare to here.
Clean and they have room for everyone and any one.
Great organized sitting for customers.
Keep the wild and little one away from the single family or whom want to enjoy quiet and peace.
We found our once a week break fast spot.
By far the best and now they are no 1 for us.</Review>

Although we do not participate in the karaoke, it looks like a lot of fun for the community.  The only down side is they are not open every night.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Started with a fairly long wait for order by a waitress with tangerine-talons who seemed to care-less about patrons. Followed by a long wait for pancakes, eggs, bacon, hash browns & toast for two. Upon arrival one bacon was crispy (I like), the other piece was near black (don’t like), but they were a decent thickness. Eggs were over easy instead of scrambled. Small breakfast for $10, but tasted okay. Waitress cheered up, smiled, bringing check. Unlikely to eat here again.< /Review>

<text>Benicia Grill II in Fairfield:
Best burger I've ever had in Fairfield since I moved here 4 years ago.! They even cook your burger to order and the fries are extraordinary..crispy on the outside...hmmm, hmmm! Great happy hour prices, too. Attentive waitress. Ok, the ambience is, well, 70's, but it's clean, non the less. Hop and a jump off Hwy. 80.< /text>< Pics>

A great hole in the wall place, for breakfast the Benicia grill breakfast is the way to go! Large portions and the kids menu is always nice too. Wish more people came to enjoy this place because its a good to place when we cant decide on dinner. Breakfast is good any time of the day and the staff is always cheerful and friendly!< /Review>

My first time visiting this restaurant and it was the worst decision I’ve made in a long time. Tables were not available so I opted for the wide open seating at the counter. I sat there for fifteen minutes without any recognition from a server that I’d be helped - as if I’m invisible. The only positive is the pleasant young lady at the front/cash register. Even though the menu looks promising, I won’t waste my time in giving this place another chance.<//Review>

Was not able to try it because bad policy about service dogs. The person in charge went to our table to tell us that they don't support service dogs, I show her the dog's tag of service dog and she did not think it was enough. We left upset.</text>

Have been to the one Benica without any problems  today went to the one in Fairfield and was told that they do not recognize service animals, only if you are blind. I would suggest the owner review the ADA for disabilities. I will not patronize either restaurant with so many others that do not violate the law.</review>

Good food, but skimpy at a high price. I pick-up ordered a bacon cheeseburger, a side of onion rings and a vailnilla shake. The burger was cold; 5 1/2 onion rings total; the shake was filled to 3 inches below the rim. This totaled $16.27.

I hope it gets better. So check your food, people, before leaving.</review>

My wife and I love Benicia Grill, located in the City of Fairfield California... Every time we have gone there we were satisfied and we left happy! Our waitresses were always friendly, and Stephanie is a wonderful friendly knowledgeable and courteous and clean waitress that always makes us feel welcome... The Benicia Grill  is now our favorite. Down home cooking, even karaoke If you go at the right time... my wife wants to try out karaoke but I keep saying no... One day I'm going to say yes and then I'll comment on that... we love Benicia Grill!< /review>

Very friendly staff, however we needed a sharper knife or chainsaw to cut the roast beef.
The chicken was great, the mash potatoes with gravy was ok..
Prices are reasonable,  appeared clean and restrooms need to be remodeled but fairly cleaned.< /text>

This was my first time eating at this restaurant, I ordered the baby back ribs with beans and fries. Unfortunately the ribs were to hard to eat as in dry and overcooked and the beans very watery. The waitress who I found out was the owner said her boss wouldn't take it off the ticket but offered a employee of discount. Maybe I caught them on a off night, but that was one of the first meals I've gotten at a restaurant.< /review>

After working there and knowing what i now know i would never ever eat there even if it were free. Cooks that use the restroom and never wash there hands .rats not mice in back. I have even seen one person who washes his feet in a sink in the kitchen. So if you do eat there so i can say is good luck and i hope you dont get sick<//text>

I came in around noon for lunch. Prices were moderate and service was okay. Not much check back check down going on. I decided to have the ribs with fries and baked beans. A side salad for the appetizer. The salad was dripping wet and the water overtook the taste for the buttermilk ranch. When the main dish came the fries were perfect temperature and texture. Beans were lukewarm. Was not satisfied with the beans. And let me get to the ribs; although, I shouldn't have expected much from a Benician Grill, the ribs were dryer than the Sahara desert. If you'd like to dissappoint your parents or don't want that second date this is the place to eat!< /Text>

This place is not the best to enjoy breakfast. They changed a weekend fee!! Who would do such a thing as to  charge extra to actually EAT?!!  And the manager was a total jerk! He was extremely disrespectful and rude. All I have to say is... don't eat here, at all!</text>

A single cup of Cold coffee was replaced with a burnt microwaved coffee that was scalding hot.  Poor attitude from both servers today. Never returned to refill my 2.75$ coffee with a fresh cup until after my meal was finished. Food was great but leaves a bad taste when your coffee and service sucks</review>

Come to find out the cheddar cheese they put on my nachos was bad, sour in smell, and taste. Hope I don't  get sick! Never coming back! Will never recommend!</Text>< Name>

My wife and I had a great breakfast at Benicia grill in Fairfield ca. The food was delicious, prices were very low and the employees were kind. I spent $18 on 2 breakfasts and oj. It was well worth it. I can't wait to go again.< /review>

< Review>
I booked with the owner, the banquet room for 10-12 people over 6 weeks ago to have a lunch meeting today.  Friday my husband and I had dinner and confirmed with the waitress that I  would have 12 people please let the owner know.  Today when I  arrived I was told their is a group that meets on a regular basis this day every month, sorry.  The waitress was very nice and apologized.   Told her it wasn't her fault she set us up in a corner.  We met but had to talk over all the others eating around us.  I was told later that this is common for  them to double book, they do it in their Benicia restaurant also.  Needless to say we won't be going back here again as a group or as individuals.< /Review>

Horrible service placed my order to go and PAID all to wait 45 minutes for the waiter to tell the manager that the kitchen didnt make it and that he needed to go and see why. If you have an hour and a half to kill then this is your spot but if not STAY AWAY</review>

<Review>Called an order in on Friday April 28  while ordering the phone was given to three different people to take my order because they don't listen. Then I had to repeat my order like 8 times. Once i finished after almost 35-40 minutes trying to place the order she finally asks for my name and once I give it to her, I asked her to spell it to make sure she had it right, she tells me no, and ask me, why. She was rude and unprofessional, and even though I spoke with her boss and,she looked at me like so what even after she lied and then apologized for what she did. The management there sucks and the food was dry, and hard,  I will never go here are refer anyone to go there.< /Review><user_id>118109014925117295503</user_id><gmap_id>0x8085167f2519852d:0xe24beb427eee9a5a</gmap_id></record>

<Text>I really like this shop and it is so sad they have to suffer through constant shutdowns. Steve has been taking care of my son for the past year through all of this nonsense. My prayers are that they bounce back because the shop is really legit. Great staff, awesome haircuts, even better environment. Open barbershops back up again!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< rate>

Although this place is a bit pricey, you do get a good quality haircut and experience. I've been here about 4 times all with Eduardo and he does a great job, definitely check it out.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Very professional and family friendly barber shop.  I was in from out of town and made the 25 min drive after reading the great reviews.  I was a walk in and was politely greeted by Steve and introduced to Kira who set me up with an appointment a few hours later. Took her time and did a great fade and even took a razor and edged up my beard for $15.  I paid $25 and was worth it.  Very polite and professional staff.  The staff is very kid friendly.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a sharp cut at a great price. If I lived in San Diego this place would definitely be my go to barber shop!</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< Review>
Went to get twists, I’ve had twists before but these weren’t what I was expecting. Gave me a mad scientist look haha. Asked for braids to fix what had been done, and the braids turned out the same, very sticky, and thin and very straight. After being there for 3 hours total, and still not liking how my braids look, I was told I can take them out myself. And still was charged full price while taking the braids out on my own while leaving which was $95. So basically a waste of 3 hours. And even had to jump out of the chair to let another appointment get his hair braided then get back in to have mine finished. Definitely NOT going back for braids, but they do good cuts though. Going somewhere else to hopefully fix my hair as we speak. At the moment I look like my hair was dipped in glue, and then electrocuted, all while getting braided lol glad people make their money for time even if the customer isn’t happy with the final product.< /Review>

< review>
Called in to see if they accept Visa in which they do. Great, next I  asked if there was a long line, said no and that they are accepting "walk ins". I arrive and 20 mins later I am told that they aren't accepting "walk ins" and it will take 2 hours to wait.

Well I'm not returning for sure.< /review>

(3:00pm) Most of our barbers are appointment only but do accept walk ins if possible. We do apologize about the confusion but please know that at most barbershops there is a wait if you don't have an appointment. Sorry for if you experienced a 1 star service but we do try our best to accommodate for customers and we are for sure a 5 star barbershop. If you reconsider, Steve the owner would be able to help you experience a better visit."}< /response>

When I moved in I struggled so much to get maintenance to come to my unit. Most of the amenities in my unit weren’t installed/working properly. Unit was not as clean as a new apartment is suppose to be on Move In day. Other than these minor issue i love living here and can’t wait for amenities to open again.</text>

<review>Great residential place, inviting and safe place to be. I believe BLVD63 has a great mix of beautiful residential apartments vicinity suitable for living and is relatively reasonably priced in the area. On top of that, it is a very popular neighborhood for young professionals and college students.< /review>< pics>

If I could rate these apartments everyday I would. Let’s start with the amount of times the actual fire alarm goes off for no reason a month. Or how management is ran by the same young college students who live here. So u know they don’t gaf about ur complaints. They have been saying for 3 months now they were going to put water in the pool and haven’t. Maintenance dgaf either so don’t waste ur time.</Text>

<Review>Rats everywhere! Saw a rat running in the hallway on the first day I moved in. I ignored it because I thought I won’t affect me anyway because I live on the fourth floor. But starting from 4 months ago, I can hear the rats running  around either on my ceiling, in air conditioner, and on top of my bathroom. Today, I even saw a rat running in my kitchen and even a dead one appears in my toilet! I tried to ask for help but does not works out at all.

Updates: they caught three Rats from the ceiling of my bathroom and still not sure if there are more</Review><Date>1616561838286</Date><gmapID>0x80d95693fef2d44b:0x428ee8e2971d8cdc< /gmapID>< rate>

This is the last place I would recommend anyone live. The staff is very unresponsive and very unhelpful when they do respond. The amenities have been closed using COVID as an excuse (despite staying closed when restrictions were lifted). The shuttle to SDSU, which is a main amenity because they cater to SDSU students, is unreliable and cancelled randomly with no notice in the middle of the day. When this happens, staff has no care for the inconvenience of leaving students stranded on campus and offers no help. A direct quote I got when asked if they could do anything to get me back home from campus after canceling the shuttle in the middle of the day: “You can walk, or buy your own Uber.” This was after the waiting 30minutes on hold while the marketing manager was supposedly trying to get me an Uber home. I guess when it got too difficult or inconvenient for them she just changed her mind.
Other concerns are messes, noise, and trash. Often there’s trash left in hallways and stairwells for days or weeks at a time. There’s a policy for not leaving trash bags out before 6pm, but it’s not enforced. There are loud neighbours hosting parties, despite the no party rule in the lease, and security doesn’t make any effort to break them up, despite calls of complaint because management won’t enforce the no parties rule until after “quiet hours”.
Overall, not profession, dirty, no value, and no care for residents or resident concerns. I’m sure I’ll get a response to this review saying to send my concerns to management, but that’s in bad faith seeing as the management are the ones who have directly caused most of my problems.</review>

<review>At first the apartments were nice and fun. But then office started coming up with BS rules and started forcing people to pay for other people’s rent (despite them saying that a new rule meant this tear everyone was only held accountable for their own rent). Also there's a RAT PROBLEM and the office will not do a single thing  about it. So you are paying way to much  for a mediocre product and experience. These apartments were awesome two years ago but they have gone downhill fast.

Would give negative stars if I could. The management has no idea of contract law. The contract is only valid once both parties sign. Up until that point, it's invalid as per their writing in the agreement. I notified Blvd63 prior to them signing that I need to withdraw the contact. Juan, Casey and Amanda kept on repeating that we needed to find someone to take over the lease and we're bound to it. After several months and endless emails of me getting ready to pursue them legally,they finally voided the contract. I think their business practices are shady and unethical and I would stay FAR away from this place. If I didn't know my rights, they would of continued to lie and take advantage of me. My persistence and knowing rental laws are the only way I was able get out. STAY AWAY!<//Review>

There was usually no one around and anyone could have gotten in to the parking garage. It gets loud on weekends too!

<text>Management in this place is a joke, it’s run by children that have leadership issues as well as lack of respect and initiative in order to accommodate the residents. The grills and the pool must be open. I moved here for the pool and grill as well as to use the gym but instead of looking for solutions they eat popcorn and use the gym for themselves(the office’s management) and not attend the residents when trying to contact them.

< Review>
Blvd 63, if it was possible to leave no stars I would. It has a group of dishonest employees that work for them. They sign leases for people who have no income, tell you they don’t even run credit checks, lie about fees and lies about communications they have with tenants. Homeless people break into apartments and nothing is done. People throw up in the hallways, people punch holes into the walls and they are left for months. Whoever does their accounting makes errors, and then wants to not own any responsibility to that error when confronted with the proof of those errors. You call the number asking for cooperate and they refuse to give you the information to complain to someone above them. Completely unprofessional and would never lease from them. Run fast away from this place. Anywhere is better than here!!!< /Review>

Don’t live here, probably one of the worst mistakes you could make. The management is a joke and are just here to try to nickel and dime you for whatever they can. Tried to charge me 2,000 for a busted rubber pipe and got caught in a lie about the damages so had to drop it down to 1,000. Lmao this place is a joke. Save yourself and find somewhere else to live.</review>

I wanted to share our great experience at Blvd63 last month when we moved our daughter in to her new apartment. We live on the Central Coast, so we spent the Thursday of move-in weekend driving down to San Diego. On the way, our daughter found out that her 3 future roommates had been relocated due to an unfortunate experience with a homeless person. She was devastated by this news and unsure of what her experience there would be. The next morning, when we went to move in, we met Jacob, the Assistant Executive Director, who, for the next couple of hours, treated us like we were the most important people in the world! He made every effort possible to make sure our daughter found a more-than-suitable apartment situation. It was unexpected, but so very much appreciated! Thank you, Jacob, for making our first experience at Blvd63 a wonderful one!! - The Brauns<//Review>

I tried going into the residents office to get a sense of what the apartment was like and a man named Jacob (Maybe Kreb? When I asked for his name he realized I wanted to report him and ran away)  said I was clearly a homeless immigrant from Asia and was asked to leave. I was horrified because I wasn't homeless and i actually wanted to rent an apartment. I told him I wasn't even Asian and he said how could I know I can barely see through my eyes. I'm horrified and can only imagine what living there is like. 0/10 would not go there again!!</Review>< Rate>

<Review>Probably the best college apartments to live in the area. It comes furnished with everything you need. Nice Pool, Workout room, and people! I am a transfer student so i missed the whole "Freshmen college dorm" experience and meeting new people. This place is catered to making new friends and having a good time. Staff is friendly and very responsive to maintenance requests. Would definitely recommend this place if you are a college student looking to live nicely while going school.<//Review>< Time>

<text>TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU LEAVE!! Staying at BLVD was quite nice for the most part (even with the CONSTANT smoke alarms and evacuations), well up until the end that is.. We left the place spotless, about as clean as it was when we moved in. Just found out that we were charged $150 for losing ONE key fob, $100 for carpet cleaning (we vacuumed and carpets were stainless), $115 for cleaning (we mopped and wiped EVERYTHING), and $65 for paint (a piece of tape peeled less than a square inch of paint off of the wall.

Worst apartment complex in San Diego.  It may look like they have cool amenities but it doesn't matter because they're not up kept. If there were employees other than children responsible for the well being of the tenants maybe this place would be more habitable. As much as I love that anyone can get away with anything in this apartment complex it would be nice to have the staff make any concerns a priority. The ice maker doesn't work, the sink is broken and now the shower and all water faucets shoot out dirty water in intervals, but don't worry they'll get to it never. Thanks blvd I didn't want to drink water or shower. If I could give half a star I would.<//review>

<Text>Live in the 4b4b room. The private room was big enough to put lots of stuff. However, the shuttle bus system was soooo bad. They said they have shuttle from 7am to 10pm, and 15-20min comes a shuttle to SDSU. BUT sometimes it took up to 30 minutes or more than a hour for the shuttle to come.

I’m hopeful that the following maintenance issues will be fixed that were there on move- in day:

Back outside security gate is off its hinges
Security gate that opens to 63rd Street is also off the hinge.

There are chains and locks on two of the three exits to the main pool. The large jacuzzi was broken and cold.

All of the hallway carpets were badly stained as if someone with a leaking oil drum rolled it up and down everywhere.

In one of the private study rooms, someone had peed and it smelled awful. Particularly because it was hot and air conditioning wasn’t working.

Considering they are getting about $5,000 a month per each shared apartment, th maintenance should be impeccable, particularly in move in day.</text>

<Text>Absolutely the worst place to live. Living here was a constant headache. The staff and management were completely unprofessional and unorganized. We were never consistently informed about anything going on with the apartment complex. Staff could never answer questions (all were college students). Our security deposit was sent to my home 8 times with the same date requesting more money for missing keys. Called and they immediately found the keys? Very large mistake to happen to slip by. MANY more instances that caused complete chaos and frustration. I do not recommend this apartment to anyone.</Text>< date>

This is my second year living at Blvd63 and each day I feel more and more at home. This complex does such a great job of creating a close community within a bigger community, and it has made living away from family such an easy transition. From their community events, facilities, and staff care, I've always felt really welcomed. The amenities are really great and the staff does a good job of maintaining the property, which makes me proud to live here. I will probably live here another year because my experience has been so positive.< /Review>

<Text>Pictures on the website are similar to pictures of people on Instagram.
The reality is super disgusting carpet floors, also carpet in the bed rooms, which are super unhygienic. The majority of the clients are still in their puberty and party 3-4 times a week. Gym is also super dirty and almost every 2. machine is broken since I am arrived 4 months ago. The hot tub is full of dirt and since I am here I saw it 2. times cleaned, after a bath you will have a strong smell.
Location is close to SDSU, but you see police activities almost every day. Last week were a guy with a gun in the apartment. Also almost everyone are just entering the building.
This would be still okay, because you can meet awesome people here, but which annoyed me at the most, are the „work system“ of the stuff. My first contract couldn’t be handled out and took almost 1 month. Then some employees (blond girl) have zero motivation to work, they just hang around in the office and talking to co workers. They don’t try to find a efficient solution, you will realize there laziness. That is really disappointing.</Text><gmapID>0x80d95693fef2d44b:0x428ee8e2971d8cdc<//gmapID>< Response>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I do not recommend living here at all. The list of problems with this facility is extensive and the lack of accountability on their end is inexcusable. To begin with the complex itself, the lack of security from the broken gates surrounding the building, to the weak security personnel causes tenants to feel unsafe and unguarded. Due to this, there are homeless and shady suspects traveling in and out of the premises. Considering this is a majority college-aged living facility, young people deserve to know they are living in a protected environment. Moreover, the staff here is extremely unprofessional. The leasing advisors and maintenance workers make advances on young women seeking residence and female tenants living here. It makes girls uncomfortable and it is unnecessary. On top of that, in the leasing process, the staff uses false advertising as a tactic to lure people into signing new leases and renewing. For example, people who have renewed have been promised lump sum visa gift cards, complimentary HBO subscriptions, a new and a remodeled workout facility, all of which HAVE NEVER been fulfilled. Even more, many residents who live here attend the nearby community college whose semester began earlier than SDSU. Due to this, the leasing staff was promising an early move-in date. Many of these residents double and triple checked with resident services beforehand to confirm this agreement, however, after people had already arrived in town prepared to move-in, they were left without anywhere to stay. NUMEROUS residents ended up without housing and had to pay their hard-earned money to find a place to sleep. This was the fault of poor administration and a lack of sympathy. Also, for those of us who would like to recycle we no option as the trash and recycling are both taken into the same dumpster. This place has thousands of tenants and this large amount of waste is very damaging. In addition, to all of this, the price of living in a place like this is largely outrageous in comparison to the lackluster reality behind the glamourous marketing scheme. Furthermore, the price of the single bedrooms within the beach cruiser and vdub style apartments are the same among the apartment and yet the square footage is obviously VERY different. In the Vdub, my roommate and I both pay $1,046 and yet my room and closet are about 2/3 the size of the other. A smaller room should be a lower price, and tenants should have the option to pay more or less depending on the size of their room.  Moreover, on move-in day I know numerous people who had been moved into rooms with bedbugs, broken windows, dirty kitchens, cigarette aromas, and large piles of trash in the common walkways, all of which are unacceptable from a complex that boasts on luxury living.  I am writing this, not to be mean, but to suggest that anyone considering signing onto a lease here thinks twice. BLVD63 seems that its only concern is the money, and shows very little concern for the actual living conditions. Until they change their ways and listen to these complaints and actively make changes to their poor management style, no one should consider living here.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Location: ✧ 5/5 ✧
BLVD 63 Units are located 20 min walk away from SDSU. However, you can also use public transportation to get there in 15 - 20 minutes. The blvd 63 apartment complex is exceptionally close to CVS pharmacy and affordable supermarket - Smart and Final Extra.
Communication: ✧ 5/5 ✧
I want to thank Eli Deventurero for being the amazing owner-operator of the apartment complex and for supporting and helping us before and during our stay there.
Cleanliness: ✧ 5/5 ✧
Living room, bedrooms, baths, gym, halls, garden, both pools, jacuzzi, and even trash rooms were spotless. There were several leaves in the pools, but that's understandable because the pools are quite big and are surrounded by palm trees and other plants.
Comfort: ✧ 5/5 ✧
Everything worked flawlessly in the unit. Wifi speed was extremely high. The living room and bathrooms were equipped with all the necessities such as towels, cleaning solutions, shampoo, soap, etc ...
Overall: ✧ 5/5 ✧ - exceptional and affordable place to stay, especially if you are studying or doing research at SDSU.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! Attention all parents and college students. BLVD63 might appeal on the outside as a fun place to live, they even trademark their apartments as “Living in paradise. Do not fall for this! They are scam artists, they know how to market to the younger demographic. I’ve lived here for the past two years, for someone who’s been here long enough I’ve seen some terrible changes throughout time. I will begin to list off some of these horrifying changes.

FIRST of all, their contract is terrible and unreliable. It’s on a joint lease, what happened with our particular situation was two of our roommates that were  LEGALLY on the lease decided they didn’t want to pay rent and left. We were startled at this, and of course trying to cover two people’s rents as college students is incredibly frustrating and difficult. We went down to the residents building helplessly trying to figure out something we can do. The property manager was very rude and cold like and simply replied to us saying “Well it’s a joint contract you guys signed it.” DO NOT LIVE HERE BC IF SOMEONE LEAVES, YOU WILL BE PENALIZED BEWARE THE CONTRACT TERMS!!

SECONDLY, SAFETY. As a woman you have to be extra cautious when walking around day/night. This area isn’t the best and there have been multiple times I have been approached by a couple homeless people in the area. If you care about your daughters/sons safety then please pick another area of San Diego, there are better neighborhoods to live in. ANOTHER THING... my  roommate  and I were walking in the halls of BlVD 63, and there was a HOMELESS MAN IN A STORAGE UNIT!!! We caught a glimpse of him and ran to our apartment. YOU would think you could be “safe” in your own apartment however, that’s not the case. I have felt that my safety has been multiply compromised.

THIRDLY, the security doesn’t do anything, there are always random people using the amenities we are paying for at BLVD63. The gym, the pools, the hot tub, the study rooms. There are numerous kids/people in the area that take advantage of these apartments and the tenants and use the amenities that are rightfully ours. Another thing, the doors are always broken and they seem to never fix them for weeks, they say they have maintenance, but where are they? Thats why anyone can come into BLVD63. The parking garage is never regulated by staff either.. cars have been broken into, things have gotten stolen. I know multiple people who have gotten their vehicles stolen as well.

FOURTHLY, THE STAFF!!! The staff is probably the most inexperienced, unprofessional, unpleasant, and most unprepared employees I have ever encountered. They have “lost” my roommates and I’s cashiers checks, and checks for rent. How could you be so irresponsible when handling that much money? Hire some professional people with experience not only is our parents at stake but we are to. I also don’t like how BLVD63 will literally charge you for anything, I’m sure I won’t ever get my security deposit back but if they even try charging us for one more thing, I will not be paying it.

To wrap up this review, ( I know it’s long) I wish I could rate BLVD63 a 0. My experience here has been very unpleasant and I’m really glad I get to move out and begin a stress free life in a few days. Please take my review into consideration, if you want to live here then you’re in luck because now they’re leasing by the bed. Right after the screwed over my parents, and me, and everyone else living in the apartment. We had to pay thousands of dollars each month to them and it’s still not enough. Also, beware of they’re “promotions” if you renew with them they offer bogus gift cards but you’ll actually never get them.. because there will ALWAYS be a reason why. They are master scam artists and they know how to appeal to a younger crowed. Don’t be naive, I hope everyone reads this there are better places to live in San Diego and I am so passionate about sharing my story to other young minded individuals likes me. I’ll make my story heard.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Worst apartment I have ever rented! Terrible & unfriendly staff, terrible, crazy, and dangerous residents! I recommend you stay anywhere else in San Diego, especially if you are a student at SDSU! I'm contemplating suing right now given how crooked staff (management) are here! They also have a rodent problem just so you know!<//Text>

<Text>Our Room 2215 was so dirty when we tried to move in. There were broken furniture and it was really messed up. We talked with the office and they promised us to get it cleaned very quickly. Four hours later nothing was happened just excuses like we have 300 rooms. Shouldn’t the rooms prepared when the big move in day is? We also tried to get in touch with the manager but they told us she would be busy actually and has no time for complaints. The staff were totally unprofessional and didn’t care about it. On the other hand they advertise a luxury living but everything is dirty, broken and used. It is absolutely not recommendable until yet. We will do another update soon to get a balanced Rezension.</Text>< user_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>TERRIBLE, AVOID.

Blvd 63 will take money out of your deposit to essentially refresh the apartment for the next tenants and make you pay for it.

Regardless of how well cleaned the apartment before moving out - and even if you are leaving it in the same condition as you entered- they will charge you hundreds of dollars for "professional" cleaning, carpet cleaning and painting.

In every other rental agreement, unless there is significant intentional damage, these things are considered to be under normal wear and tear. Landlords usually invest in refreshing the place for the next tenants as part of their business. Blvd 63 instead just makes you pay for it because they think they can go unchallenged.

Not only do they charge you hundreds of dollars they do not even provide you with any photo evidence as to what has been fixed or what damage has been caused which needed remedying.

Instead they simply send your deposit statement back with half of it removed without any explanation or evidence.

If you want to stay in a massively overrated place where management will charge you hundreds or thousands of dollars unnecessarily for their own gain then go for it.

Otherwise avoid like the plague.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1537495207244, 'text': 'Thank you so much for bringing this concern to our attention, and we are very disappointed to hear about your experience.

<rate>2</rate><Text>Terrible contract terms. There's a special place in hell for whoever invented the term "shared lease agreement." You WILL NOT get out of your lease unless you find a replacement resident, which is nearly impossible. Nobody wants to pay Blvd's premium prices. On top of that, you will need signatures from all your roommates AND guarantors, JUST to approve the new guy/girl. Not to mention the $300 replacement fee.

You will be at the mercy of everyone else when it comes to paying rent and switching out. IF SOMEONE STOPS PAYING RENT, EVERYONE IS PENALIZED UNLESS THEY PICK UP THE SLACK. IF YOUR ROOMMATE DOESN'T LIKE YOUR PICK FOR A REPLACEMENT, YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

Fell in love with this place from the first time my roommates and I came here for a tour. There was no doubt that we would call this place home for the next couple of years. BLVD63 is huge and has all amenities that you could possibly think of: two pools, well-equipped gym, tanning beds, pool tables, study rooms, tv room and more. Besides that, there is always something going on: pool parties, free food, entertaining organized by management/workers. Most people who live here go to state, so you constantly see your classmates around and it is easy to make friends with everybody. Overall, great experience living here so far!</Text>

I’ve lived here for almost two years now and I’m going to be sad to leave BLVD next year for my study abroad. This is an amazing apartment to live in. Imagine all the social aspects of living in a dorm but none of the gross communal restrooms and lack of privacy. Mostly everyone here is sophomores/juniors/seniors at SDSU, so it’s really easy to socialize and make new friends, especially with all the events that they throw for their residents! The staff is very informational and organized. When I had trouble with anything, Gabby would always be there to explain everything and get it all squared away, which is something I can’t be grateful enough for because I never had to go searching for someone to fix something for me.
The best part about living here is the amount of amenities that we have access to and how huuuuge the rooms are. The apartment comes with the standard furniture, but there’s still plenty of room to personalize and make it our own. The bathrooms have two sinks (if you have a double) and the beds are full sized. It’s a huge upgrade from the dorms, and it costs less too. There’s also a big gym, two pools, and a clubhouse with a lot of individual study rooms if you ever want to have study groups. I really liked the study rooms because the wall is a giant white board that you can do homework problems on.
My one tip after living here for such a long time is that if you have a service request, either call the office or go down and put it in. It’s a lot faster that way than if you submit it online, because they print it right away at the desk and it’ll get into the maintenance workers’ hands faster that way. Other than that, you’re going to have a great time living here!</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Although the commodities and living spaces are nice, the price for living here is extremely high with unnecessary costs for things like monthly events that only a limited number of people attend and does not benefit everyone. Especially those with highly busy days. Parking is unreasonable and you can get towed for changing cars while yours is getting fixed. The reasoning behind getting towed is apparently so that the parking permit is not shared, but even so it is still only one car that gets stored.<//review>< Pictures>

Best place to live if you go SDSU. Amenities included are convenient and the staff at the clubhouse is very customer service oriented. Only suggestion would be to add some colors or art to the hallways as I love bringing my friends over and promoting the apartment but the second we step into the hallways I feel very ashamed of feeling like I live in a prison. Even fifty twenty-five's hallways are nicer!!<//Text>

So I wrote another review and it took me here? Thought I would be sharing first to Google here and now I will hit post and see if I go back to that screen and have a Facebook choice again? Where did the original go also?</text>

< review>
Though the apartments are somewhat luxurious the 90% college tenants defiantly lessen the value and quality of the property and your stay by trashing the place, setting alarms off once a week, and constant ding dong ditching. Also the surrounding community is pretty bad.<//review>

< Review>
DO NOT SIGN A LEASE WITH A STRANGER!!  If your roommate does not pay the rent, BLVD63 will send debt collectors after EVERYONE on the lease.  My roommate didn't pay her rent for her last 2 months, and now the rest of us have over $2000 debt on our credit report.  She ran home to Canada after sticking us with the rent.  Don't sign a lease with strangers, especially from other countries!!!!   You've been warned.  It's despicable that BLVD63 encourages foreign students and then forces everyone to co-sign the lease.</Review>

The apartment is nice, but the refrigerator is terrible, it might as well be a air conditioner it doesn't keep food cold. And the quality of the electrical work is also sub par. When I adjust my over head fan speed my speakers all make a clicking noise, and one time my tv flashed white.</review>

There is a  girl who works in the resident services with glasses who is really quite RUDE , she doesn't smile and is NOT friendly at all. Your really shouldn't have an employee working with your paying residents or be a representation of the BLVD community who can't communicate appropriately or be polite and friendly like the rest of the staff. Her rude demeanor definetly sticks out like a sore thumb.< /text>

Good luck trying to get your questions answered by the staff, they're pretty much useless. The only saving grace to the place is the maintenance staff are very friendly and punctual about service requests you have. Wifi is unreliable, the furniture feels cheap and the pool/hot tub closes at 10 pm.< /Review>

<text>Do yourself a favor and DO NOT LIVE HERE. Where to begin... 1. Most of all most of the staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. 2. The apartment complex is brand new, but has been constructed very cheaply so everything breaks easily. 3. The security is a joke. They walk around and pretend they are keeping this place safe,  but really are not. When you want to contact them they don't even answer. 4. The parking garage is a joke. You pay a monthly fee to park there and your car is not even secure. Cars get damaged and broken into because the doors don't even work. Not to mention my car was TOWED unfairly. All BLVD 63 cares about is the ridiculous amount of money they get from their residents. If I could move I would, but I'm stuck in their expensive 12-month lease. I wish I could give them no stars.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Worst place and worst WI-FI here, they wont let u install your own Wi-Fi so they can turn it off when u didn’t pay the rent on time. They will send people to check the room without any permission, at 10 am. The whole building is just noisy, u can hear any car passing though or any noise your roommate made.

- Be prepared to be woken up in the middle of the night once a week by the eardrum-bursting fire alarm that lasts 30 minutes or longer. Cannot emphasize enough how unnecessarily loud they are. Your ears will feel as if they are bleeding.
- Live on the top floor or enjoy drunk idiots jumping around above you
- No one uses the trash chutes and throws their bags on the floor of the trash room
- Drunk idiots screaming at the top of their lungs in the middle of the night 3+ nights a week
- Stay away from the units surrounding the pools. There's a high concentration of groups of insecure douchebags who love to be as loud as possible to let everyone know they're having a grand old time giving themselves cancer by drinking copious amounts of cheap piss beer and smoking their d1ck flavored bluntzZ
- Drunk idiots throwing glass bottles into the pool every week
- Majority of residents are spoiled brats or foreign
- Don't live here unless you're one of the above species
- Takes hours after delivery to get your packages
- Go overspend your money elsewhere with at least a decent location< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>Staff is absolutely terrible. I had a question and called down to the front desk to not only have to deal with an unprofessional, annoyed employee but didn't get any answers and suprise suprise she hung up on me then hung up on me again. This happened about 3 weeks ago. The staff is pretty unprofessional in general but the girl in the office tops it all. And of course the cheap wear and tear they are not legally allowed to take out of our deposit yet did it anyways.< /Review>< pics>

Stay away from this place,  I have never seen or experienced such a complete rip-off before in my life.  The PARKING is a complete joke, charging us to park in an empty parkade.   Seriously???  Everything breaks its made very cheaply.  BLVD 63 you suck.< /Review>

<gmapID>0x80d95693fef2d44b:0x428ee8e2971d8cdc</gmapID><text>Just beware, this place is the typical San Diego college rental that tries to take care of the unsuspecting tenant and keep their deposits!

VERY rude and non responsive to tenants requests.  Sent emails for 5 days leading up to Move-out only to be ignored about the procedure and specifics about parking passes and security deposit return.  I am a guarantor of my daughters apartment and I would of liked this info before she had to leave.  Talked to them today, ONE day after move-out and they said there were "too busy" to get to anyone's questions.    I go after landlords for failure to abide to the rental law on specific events such as move out and to be ignored shows you how unprofessional they are and ignorant of the laws.

So, Christian today informed me that everyone's carpet gets cleaned and charged against the security deposit as "they have to have it sanitized for the next renter".  WRONG.   They do have it have it clean and ready for the next tenant, but IT IS NOT deductible from the security deposit if it;s normal wear and tear.  Once I called her out on her statement, she put me on hold for over 8 minutes only to go and talk to her manager.  Then I got transferred to the Manager who told me that they were "too busy" to itemize and take photos of everyone's unit that just moved out to prove the damage and that she has over 250 units to manage!  Oh well, that $2800 rent x 250 so they should have plenty of money to pay the proper staff to do their job.</text><response>None<//response>< username>

The twos pools and the hot tub, the gym, the shuttles and all the amenities make it really comfortable.</review>

WORST place I could've possibly chosen to live. It certainly seems nice at a glance but what you don't see is that the appliances and plumbing are the cheapest, worst quality there is. Everything is always clogging and the dishwasher doesn't even work.

Get ready to be woken up at least once a a week by a fire alarm that go on for half an hour. Get ready to hear Fetty Wop blasting till the wee hours in the morning during finals. Get ready to walk into the hallways greeted by dog poop and vomit.

The pool areas are nice but are closed half the time because some idiot threw a bottle off their balcony and when they are open, they're over run by El Cajon's finest lowlives. You can't even call security because the phone number doesn't work.

Lastly, good luck getting your security deposit back because they do this thing where two weeks before move out they send a notice saying ALL your roommates need to sign IN-PERSON, but of course it's summer and most people are gonna vacationing. They also lost $600 of designer sunglasses I ordered from amazon.

F*** YOU BLVD!!!</Review>

<Text>The apartments are themselves are actually prett nice, many amenities and very central location.  All in all not bad, however the  parking situation is an absolute joke.  Either pay an exorbitant amount for a parking permit (which cost more than a parking permit at SDSU) try to find parking around the complex (many spots which have been marked white with meter maids patrolling constantly) or park in the surrounding neighborhood where pissed off residents slash your tires for parking in front of their houses (I see on average about half a dozen tires slashed and cars keyed a week and have literally seen hundreds of tires slashed in the last year)  All while the parking structure sits half empty. If you're going to pay a "luxury price" parking should absolutely be included.< /Text><date>1439406240360<//date>< Resp>

<Time>1568483814539< /Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The best possible accommodation you live in and the price is all inclusive even Wi-Fi and the main furniture are attitudes and electricity, very clean Staff are wonderful and young people help you with anything and have festive occasions every month I think if I sat in Sandigo 4 years what I think I change until حتى but you have to search for Apartment before and booked from their page on Facebook and announce the search for friends if Tibi live with people only drawback is difficult to find an apartment with Romitat.
Note: Housing is not recommended for families because it is 99% ؜ young men and women and university students, but they are respected because the housing Mb any one is estimated to pay Mghlh (expensive for some)
Its advantages
- Bus Uodic and return to the University of SDSU
- Privacy and safety of housing
- Gas station, restaurants, pharmacy, bank and all the services you need very close to you.

افضل سكن ممكن تسكن فيه والسعر شامل كل شيء حتى الواي فاي والاثاث الرئيسي عادا المواقف والكهرباء ، نظيف جداً موظفيه رائعين وشباب يساعدونك بأي شيء ويوجد لديهم مناسبات احتفاليه كل شهر اعتقد لو بجلس في سانديغو ٤ سنين ما افكر اغيره حتى  👍🏼 لكن يجب عليك البحث عن الشقه قبل وحجزها من صفحتهم في الفيسبوك وتعلن فيها بالبحث عن اصدقاء اذا تبي تسكن مع ناس عيبه الوحيد صعب تجد شقه مع روميتات.
ملاحظة : السكن لا يوصى للعوائل لانه ٩٩٪؜ شباب وبنات  وطلاب جامعة لكنهم محترمين لان السكن مب اي احد يقدر يدفع مبغله ( غالي بالنسبه للبعض )
مميزاته
- باص يوديك ويرجعك للجامعه SDSU
- خصوصيه وامان فالسكن
- محطة وقود ومطاعم و صيدليه وبنك و جميع الخدمات التي تحتاجها قريبه جداً منك.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1527095587703, 'text': "Hi Mohammed, thank you so much for sharing your five-star rating of our community!

(Translated by Google) I give 4 stars because I loved living down, the setting is super nice, a quarter of an hour walk or shuttle SDSU and the value for money compared to other residences is really worth it. There are many international students and the place makes it possible to make lots of meetings. The maintenance service is great and fast.
HOWEVER the big downside is the administrative service, if you arrive outside office hours, no one will be there to welcome you and give you the keys and you may end up on the street for the night. They will not give you any information, it's up to you to pick them up. Level payment of rent and deposit I think he should be ashamed. You have to pay to pay your rent and despite an impeccable apartment they will take you a nice sum on your deposit which will not be returned by transfer but thanks to a check sent to your home. To recover it do not be impatient and do not be afraid to contact them several times if you want to review the color ...
Mine is "weirdly" not arrived, result we must pay to have a follow-up to be sure that it is sent. Not to mention the cost of international calls that I had to make ...
To summarize, I recommend this residence which is for me the best but administrative side I think they are thieves and there is much progress to be made.

Je donne 4 étoiles parce que j’ai adoré vivre la bas, le cadre est super sympa, à un quart d’heure à pied ou en navette de SDSU et le rapport qualité prix par rapport à d’autres résidences vaut vraiment le coup. Il y a beaucoup d’étudiants internationaux et le lieux permet de faire pleins de rencontres. Le service de maintenance est super et rapide.
CEPENDANT le gros bémol est le service administratif, si vous arrivez en dehors des heures d’offices, personne ne sera là pour vous accueillir et vous donner les clés et vous risquez de vous retrouver à la rue pour la nuit. Ils ne vous donnerons aucune information, à vous d’aller les chercher. Niveau paiement du loyer et de la caution je trouve qu’il devraient avoir honte. Vous devez payer pour payer votre loyer et malgré un appartement impeccable ils vous prendront un jolie somme sur votre caution qui ne vous sera pas rendue par virement mais grâce à un chèque envoyé à votre domicile. Pour la récupérer ne soyez pas impatient et n’ayez pas peur de les contacter plusieurs fois si vous voulez en revoir la couleur ...
La mienne n’est “bizarrement” pas arrivée, résultat nous devons payer pour avoir un suivi afin d’être sûr qu’elle est envoyée. Sans compter le coût des appels à l’international que j’ai du effectuer...
Pour résumer, je recommande cette résidence qui est pour moi la meilleure mais coté administratif je trouve que ce sont des voleurs et qu’il y a de gros progrès à faire.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>VERY long story short.
I received a brand new iPhone, I activated it, but when I had opened it out of the box the back glass between the two cameras was cracked.
Christian failed to check the phone before handing it off to my brother who brought the phone to me in Utah.
Christian (and his manager Miguel) claim that “if we take the phone out to inspect it, we have to activate it.” And my brother and I didn’t want to do that since I needed my old phone to still work for my job (which, ended up not working anyways.)
Their statement is not true though. I talked with Brian from the Victra location up here, Ryan from a Go Wireless store, and another Brian from Go Wireless Customer Support, amongst the two other customer service lines at Verizon and they all told me the same thing: “No, you do not have to activate the phone when you open the box. Part of our job in sales is to inspect the phone so these things don’t happen.”

Now, since my phone was conveniently not opened in store by Christian and he and Miguel don’t want to take the blame, I’m now stuck paying for a damaged BRAND NEW PHONE that I didn’t want to begin with because my old one was just fine, but we were doing a BOGO deal. On top of that! Now they’re saying “they had run out of the BOGO deal so it was a trade in deal.”

Oh, and I could use my old phone if I unlock the SIM card but I still have to pay for this damaged device.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZzg6vDC-lYGgH4yrBwgSOznb6TFMt7vvbF7kR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOejxkIth9cyBVjbwg4fV9IOQ3He-5oD2dOA8O6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1613397150810, 'text': "We are sorry to hear about your experience with this store.

<Text>I wanted to take a few minutes and compliment the Go Wireless team.

My phone started acting up Friday evening.  The screen on my S10 (512 memory)  went black and only worked with a bright white line about 1 inch along the bottom and when connected to a charger.

I NEED a working phone and woke up on Saturday with the goal of going to bed with a replacement.  I use Verizon for their service and I drove over to the River to find that corporate store closed.  Fine I drove all the way to their second location in La Quinta only to be told I couldn't shop in store and they could text me a link.  Very frustrating as my phone wasn't working (I could dial out through the Bluetooth on my car)  While on hold for 10 minutes with Verizon, I drove over to gowireless off  Washington.  I also contemplated switching companies as the corporate solution was ridiculous.

I walked right in and was immediately greeted with how can I help you.  I spoke with Miguel and explained my dilemma and we picked out a phone.  Only to find out that store didn't have the model I wanted. I asked if the PS location did and he said yes and called Adrian and sent me that way.  I was planning to get my haircut right next door it was perfect.

Adrian was also very helpful and was about to sell me the phone we both thought I wanted when he noticed I had the 512 version and the one available was only 128.  We checked and saw I was already using 104 and I said I wanted the 256 version of the S21.  Well there was only 1 in the valley down in PD.  So Adrian called and spoke with Javier and made sure I could get it if I headed down there.

I did and Javier quickly transferred my data and sent me on my way with a new phone.  I really appreciated the way your team members were not focused on a commission or a sale and more focused on getting me the RIGHT phone.  Even Christian from the Washington store was very helpful, friendly and professional when I called and got your email.

Before this transaction I avoided the Go Wireless stores and headed straight to the corporate store.  Now I will only be visiting your establishment when I am in need of upgrading.

Miguel C. was simply excellent. We had several transactions to accomplish, devices to set up, and a million questions to ask. Miguel handled the complex tasks with skill, good nature, and a smile. What more could two senior folks ask for?
We left well equipped and well trained with everything transferred, ported, passworded, and eventually even paid for!! Thank you Miguel in Palm Desert!!</Review>

Horrible experience ever, the guy with glases very rude, no customer service skills at all, he looked like he was already frustrated when we walked in, and took it out on us. My daughter's first phone carriers choice ended up with at&t thanks to that guys attitude, and we couldn't made a better choice, because we wore treated like any consumer/customer should be treated with great attitude and attention.< /Review>

This is by far, the best experience I've ever had picking out a phone. Miguel helped me weigh the pros and cons of the devices that I was considering and even saved me money on my current plan. The other associates there, Christian and Danny, were also extremely helpful and provided me with their opinions on the best devices and services. What a great group of guys! They really made the whole experience effortless. So if you're looking for a new phone or to change up your service, head here and ask for one these guys. You can't go wrong!<//Text>

Along with all his belongings.  When he went to the store to have it replaced they made it so difficult for him and wouldn’t   replace it.  Would not even let him use their phone so he could contact me to help.  Kept saying it wasn’t their policy.  He had no choice but to leave the store.   I’m so disappointed with this store. We have been long time Buisness customers with many phones and iPads with our employees.

Daniel Martinez was excellent. He was knowledgeable, efficient , calm, he gave care and attention to me. He had a easy comfortable demeanor. He is skilled in interacting with customers. He was completely in control of the job. I could tell that he had a good attitude and he clearly approaches his work from a very good and sincere perspective..that level of customer service is a rare event..he is very intelligent young man..I think he represented Verizon very well..thank you...</review>

Not a good experience at go wireless hacienda location.
I was informed by Daniel (the manager) our expierence here would surpass going to Costco instead.
I've always bought our phones at costco.
Never had a problem!! And its less expensive..
Since we bought 2 galaxy 10s phones and accessories $$$ at this location.
I've been back at least 5 times to this store!
Still no resolve!
And mind you it's only getting worse as of today.
Daniel said he would keep the old phones in case we needed to back up anything.
I even text him to hold them longer.
He replied no problem.
Well the phones got sent out.
Our personal pictures are gone.
I'm not a happy camper!

I found the pictures!
Good news.
Still waiting for other resolves.< /Review>

<Review>My Verizon Samsung is listen is battery power. Daniel sold me the phone a little over year ago,  And was very empathetic,  However, there was really nothing he could do.  It's a shame, that they tie these kids hands, and keep them from providing service that makes Verizon look positive. I left very discouraged, but I felt like Dan had done everything that he could within the parameters that he had to work with. If I ever get the opportunity I will switch from Verizon.   The 5 rating is for Daniel, not for Verizon. Years ago they used to help you. Forget about refurbished phones. Next time, Walmart!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I purchased the Go Advantage Screen Protector program that gives you unlimited replacements of your screens and 25% off all accessories. It has more than paid for itself as i have had several screens break over the last year. It is a service I believe everyone needs to have if you have a screen protector on your phone. Foster and Hailey are amazing. Personable, professional and extremely helpful.<//Review>

I went in there just to buy a case that’s it. Waited 15 minutes. They were helping two customers set up new phones that’s going to take awhile obviously so you expect me to wait 30 minutes to an hour for you to do so crazy! All I wanted to do was buy a case would take you 30 sec to check me out I wait 15 n decide just to walk out when you doing long processes you should be able to ring a customer up real quick rather than have them wait 30 minutes to an hour I wasn’t needing anything difficult mine would have been fast waisted 15 minutes and I couldn’t get a case not trying to wait longer than that to purchase an item real quick< /text>

<text>Not a good experience at go wireless hacienda location.
I was informed by Daniel (the manager) our expierence here would surpass going to Costco instead.
I've always bought our phones at costco.
Never had a problem!! And its less expensive..
Since we bought 2 galaxy 10s phones and accessories $$$ at this location.
I've been back at least 5 times to this store!
Still no resolve!
And mind you it's only getting worse as of today.
Daniel said he would keep the old phones in case we needed to back up anything.
I even text him to hold them longer.
He replied no problem.
Well the phones got sent out.
Our personal pictures are gone.
I'm not a happy camper!

I found the pictures!
Good news.
Still waiting for other resolves.</text><Name>Sandra Watts< /Name><UserId.>101989704987245200169<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Amy robbed us for sure!
We got 2 new phones and she said we will only be paying for the phones for $187/month including taxes but our bill is at $261.00.
She said that she will be paying for the difference but she hasn't so far, and she promised that we will receive a $200 gift card, and a  phone protector that never came.
She made us sign up for HUM  which turns to be a is a stupid app,
This person needs to be fired, and to everyone who was misled by her, we need our money back or at least sue Verizon Palm Desert.
Fraudulent misrepresentation.

I will sue you Amy and Verizon for having you,  so I can be able to make 15k in return for all your lies.</text>

<Review>My experience here was by far the best experience at any Verizon Location! The reps here are tremendously helpful, especially a nice young handsome man by the name of John. He was very knowledgeable and very aware of all Verizon standards. If you step inside this store make sure to ask for him for all the help you may need! I will forever make this my one stop Verizon for all my concerns! Great job team!< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Name>

Daniel is the best verizon rep ive ever had. Previously went to apple to see if they could first help but did absolutely nothing. Daniel, helped me set up a new account and was able to retrieve all my contacts along with my pics of my mom that passed away. If someone in charge can promote him i would surely vouch for him in a heartbeat. Very knowledgeable and puts hard dedication towards his customers.<//Review>

I went to the store on Washington tonight. I thought my phone was broke . I was greeted by Tyler, very nice
Very polite, VERY SMART. He ran a test and within 2 minutes I was walking out the doo4 with a fixed phone. I have been a Verizon customer for 12 years, I will continue to go to.  Go wireless.  Thanks Tyler.  You made a old mans night.</Review>

Beware. Ask for a receipt. Read your receipt. They wouldn't have given us a receipt if we had not asked.

They added insurance coverage without asking my 80-year old mom. They added it with the purchase of a glass screen cover.

This is their standard practice. As my mom said, "What do I need with lifetime coverage?" I may not be here another year." Well, we hope she will be with us for many years - but, the practice is deceptive no matter how they try to explain it.<//Review>

<Text>Amy is a worker I would never ever ever want working for me. I'm in shock she has never been fired from Verizon! Very disgusted! She's an impulsive liar and convinced my mom to get a new phone because she couldnt fix the phone dimness. Was only 5 months old and was not even cracked! Why did she not use the warranty to get a replacement phone!?!?!? But managed to take her phone as a working condition and gave her these accessories she didnt need. Why didnt she get that trade in value towards the new phone, was that because you told her it's only towards accessories..Oh because shes on comission and I wouldnt be surprised that she does this with all customers to be number one in the district. Now i pretended to be a customer and took my phone in to see "Amy". I wasnt authorized on the account but she called to have permission from my son who's on the account. Is this allowed? Do you guys not check IDs or just let anyone on the account have authorizion?? What I discovered was that she didnt even take the time to see what's wrong with it. She just wanted me to upgrade to a new phone. NOW IS THIS HOW VERIZON TREATS EVERYBODY? I recorded my phone functionally working before and after. Very disgusted is her service. Taking our money even if the phones working. And as well what kind of sales consultant wears leggings to work?? Very unprofessional I hope Verizon takes action of this!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1559068902670, 'text': "Hector, we are sorry to hear about your experience with this store.

These guys are great. They are very patient, despite the fact that it seems like 90% of their time is dealing with the not so technically sect in how to operate their phones. Always service with a smile.<//Text>

Its really just a good thing that I have the opportunity to tell you how much I appreciate the service that I received from Foster I came into the store without knowing anything about what I wanted and I am ready to leave knowing that I have the best treatment and the best peace of mind that I could possibly have and it's all due to the manner in which I was treated by Foster I think that Verizon has done an awfully good job hiring him and I am very pleased thank you< /Text>

Kalen was very professional. And patient with every question I had. He deserves a raise or a promotion. But everyone in the store was very professional and kind to your customers. Also he's very handsome young man. This is the second time I have dealt with Kalen and each time it has been impeccable service thank you</Text>

He should be recognized for his tenacity, dedication, and friendly professional attitude. You have a real winner in Kalen. Thanks again Kalen. Arthur Sacco< /review>

Absolute brilliance. The practice facilities are 12/10.
The course manicure and landscape is BAR NONE.
Pace of play was NEVER AN ISSUE.
Greenside bunkers extremely well taken care of.
TEE BOXES were immaculate.
Yardage markers from 200 in along cart paths and fairway.
As a guest today from another country club this was a real treat. Hopefully looking to get back within a week or two.
Bar staff was brilliant as well! Super friendly and personable!
The beginning of the experience from walking in the doors at the front desk to the pro shop, to the 18 holes, Valley HI... an absolute winner. 🏆< /Review>

Excellent experience. Price to join is not bad  250 initiation and 120 /month includes 2 free rounds. Amenities are excellent. Driving range pitching range and putting green if I lived closer it would be a great fit</review>

We were here for a real estate training event. The food was good, the service was prompt and courteous, the room was large, all audio and visual tools worked well, seemed like a very nice place for an event. Best of all, the ladies bathroom line was super fast at the breaks because they have the right amount of stalls for a large group like ours!<//Text>

I walked into LC iffy about getting glasses as I always chose to use contact lenses instead. Ruth was excellent in answering all my questions and having me try several glasses till we found the right ones for me! She even helped my mom with a pair of prescription sun glasses which she loves! Fun experience! Thanks, Ruth</Review>

I loved the excellent customer service provided by Ruth! She is knowledgeable, fashion savvy, energetic and had my best interest in mind. On top of all that, she was friendly, and a pleasure to talk to.  I am extremely satisfied with the service I was provided.  Thank you Lenscrafters, and a super thank you to Ruth!</Review>

Wanted to give Ruth at Lens  Crafters in Cerritos a huge THANK YOU! She has always been so kind during our visits. All visits ranging from replacing nose pads, adjustments & frame replacement for my son, my mother and myself. As well as many eye exams and making sure we all leave with what we want! Hands down the best service from Ruth!!< /text>

<Text>Lost my glasses I went to two other lenscrafters locations and they couldn’t help me. I walked in and the lady who greeted me listened to my situation and found a similar frame that my lens would fit in. She had to warm them up a bit but she made magic happen. I couldn’t be more happier with the service I received.<//Text><userid>115992750603314609902<//userid>< Resp>

My experience is always amazing at LensCrafters in Cerritos Mall. Dr. Danny Wong is the absolute BEST and a true eye care professional. He always exceeds my expectations and ensure my vision needs are met. Finally, an extra special THANK YOU to Sherri for helping me select gorgeous frames AND Emily, gosh, pure brilliance. Emily, thank you for providing great information, and you hit a home run with the warranty plan and anti-fog solution. You all are an exceptional team. Thanks for everything!<//Review>

<text>Went in to inquire how much a screw would be to attach my broken arm back on my glasses. She did it for free and tightened up the other screw as well. Super helpful and nice.

This is the first time I shopped at Lens Crafters.  The store was well organized and had a nice selection.   I was there to purchase a pair of sunglasses to utilize an gift certificate that I had.   I am very happy with the selection, the customer service was WONDERFUL, and I never had heard insurance on glasses before, how novel.  I am very happy with the experience and love my new sunglasses. THANK YOU. I would recommend this store and location was great.< /Review>

<Review>Came in to see if my sratches on my lens could be buffed out. I was approached by Jenny. She informed me that it was not an option however she looked up my profile and noticed I had protection on my lens. Only $25 to get my lens replaced and they were done in an hour. The service provided was way beyond my expectations. When I came back to pick them up Sandra gave me my glasses and reminded me I still have 6 months on my plan incase it happens again. You gained a loyal customer<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

<Review>I came in for an eye exam and everyone was so friendly. I felt extremely safe with all the cleaning they were doing due to covid. Everyone was so knowledgeable and made my experience extremely pleasant. I was able to get my glasses in a few hours. This was a huge win for me. Every single person working made an interaction with me while I was there even the manager. That made me feel welcomed and special. Keep up the good work and I will refer all my friends to your location.<//Review>< Name>

Dr Wong is very thorough and patient, especially with children. And Ruth was amazing at explaining our benefits, and what we get with our glasses and the choices we have! Thanks for all your help and knowledge of our benefits and glasses!!< /Review>

My experience  here is not good! Ive been waiting for my eyeglasses and i didnt recieve a call or email that my eyeglasses are ready . Unfortunately, i spoke to Emily which is the manager in the store. They told me that i have missing number in my phone number and i ask her why you guys do something just to reach me out and let me know that my eyeglasses is ready! And i heard Emily that she almost hang me up! Is that a good customer service? I dont have any comments to all the Dr!<//Text>

<Text>Unfortunately my last experience at the Cerritos mall store was beyond bad. I am very sad to write this review.
Having been a loyal customer for over 10 years in two different locations I truly felt hurt by the way I was treated by the store manager that was patronizing me and completely ignored what I was saying. One would expect a more humane approach during Covid time.< /Text>< UserId.>

<text>I visited the outlet on the 18th June with my family members. After prescription by the doctor and selection, it took almost more than an hour to get billing done. Disappointed and had my Birthday plans spoiled on that day.

Again on the 23rd called to get a break up of the Vision Benefits Summary, which was promised to be sent in my email. Did not receive it. I had to personally visit on the 25th to get a copy. On going personally, was told that whether I did check my email. It was so ridiculous and not proper.

I was told that my glasses are of a special make and is being ordered. Will take 7 days and will receive a text message. Not getting a text , I enquired on 25th and was told that it will take another couple of days. No response so far. Again enquired today and was again told that it will take a couple of days. I do not know how many couple of such days it will take.

Really disappointed.</text>< pics>

I always shop every year at LensCrafters I like their promotions, and their associates never disappoint! I walked in to this location not knowing if my new insurance would cover this chain. Amy an associate didn't hesitate to do the research. Once Amy gave me my new insurance coverage, she transferred me to Melissa who would finish with the transaction. Overall, I appreciate the superb professional/friendly   Service! Thank you!</Review>

<review>I will never shop in this store. I went there with my prescription and I requested all the items that my eye doctor recommended. They charged for all the services and wrote an invoice that didn't  disclose everything. I asked the sales TWICE  about my blue protection and she said that it was in my glasses.  Two years later the assistant of my doctor gave me a new prescription and told her that the current one has blue protection. She looked at my glasses and told me that my glasses did not have it. Thanks Lens Crafters I have been 2 years working in front of the computer thinking all this time that  my eyes were protected.  I went there to get my new prescription and explained the manager what happened. He refused to give the discount of the missing item based on my last purchase. Now,  I'm experiencing the effects of this BIG mistake. To be safe, I will only buy my prescriptions from my eye doctor.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Date>1556158487198</Date><rating>1<//rating><Text>My name is as listed on my review.If I could give this place negative star review i would. I recently went in for my prescription renewal. By FAR THE WORSE TREATMENT AND SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN THE 6 YEARS OF BEING A CUSTOMER WITH THEM. Since the start of my appointment I repeated the purpose of my visit, so everyone is on the same page " BASIC EYE EXAM" average cost $79.00 I really dont know how many times I repeated myself. They had me take off my current pair of contacts since I was switching to glasses. Mind you I have astigmatism and cant see ANYTHING but shapes and sizes. So they ran all the tests as if I were to be tested to receive contacts, the optometrist Jenny Y. Park OD does all her testing,and brings me a pair of contacts having me put them on because I had mine thrown away by the assistant from the intial vision distance test. Obviously, THEY ARE THE PROFESSIONALS and I did as SHE said. Everything checked out good I got my new prescription and go to check out and my bill comes out to over $140.00 for a CONTACT FITTING EXAM. When I repeated myself to the 1st girl and " Jenny Y. Park OD" that I wanted my GENERAL EYEGLASSES EXAM. i questioned the girl processing my payment because it was supposed to be $79.00. And THE BS they give me next is certainly unacceptable Jenny Park comes and tells me I "Asked" for contacts, taking no responsibility for their screw up MAKING ME go into their consultation room and having me TAKE OFF THE CONTACTS! I ended up not being able to drive, and calling my friend to pick me up because I couldnt see ANYTHING ,after SHE (JENNY PARK)  MADE ME TAKE OFF THE CONTACTS AND I HAD DISPOSED OF MINE ORIGINALLY in the first test. HOW COULD THEY BE SO DAMN INCONSIDERATE AND IRRESPONSIBLE TO THEIR CUSTOMER NEEDS. Never again will I be going back. WOW! worse service,optometrist, and assistant's I've ever had to deal with. On top of having have called 3 times because I was hung up twice.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Theresa is a very sarcastic individual. She doesn’t  hold up her own actions and lies to cover her reputation. Doesn’t take control like a head leader. Also their product is not good quality.
She should be fired.< /Review>

(NO Stars)I can understand that certain views and or likes may not be the same as my own, Yet I would appreciate just having an answer not given in a rude manner and have the phone slammed and hung up on April 14th 11:54a. Very unprofessional! maybe a few weeks in an unemployment line would have the person understand what "CUSTOMER SERVICE ENTAILS"</Text>

Dude SHOULD get NO STARS, Worst experience I have ever had. I got it; The Manger made it clear, he didn't want my kind in his store. Upon entering the facility,  he asked what are you looking for and my response was I would like to look around and make SOME purchases: NOPE, NOT ALLOWED. GO DOWN THE STREET. Do you have ammo I asked; sold out! From his demeanor, I could asked for a tent and he would have told me to go down the street. Stopped at the door and everyone before and after me was allowed in.</Text>

< review>
I would give them zero stars because of the poor service that they present. The covid guidelines in their area say that only three people are aloud at in the store at a time and there were no customers in there and they did not let us in. They then let us in and were just rude and nasty. I am a long time customer at this store and to be treated like this is really disappointing and I will not shop at this place again< /review>

They sold me a defective bike pump but when I tried to return it to the store, the manager was rude and refused to give me a refund. Instead, he forced me to drive 20 minutes across town to the other location (that's 40 min round trip!).

I get the Covid is making things weird right now,  but you still have to be polite to customers and make things right when you mess up.<//Text>

Without having a dressing room how are you supposed to figure out if something fits? Never going back here again. Very poor service.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I came a long way to get a few things for my equipment. Like, really expensive stuff I was willing to pay for. But just because I looked the way I looked, they didn't let me in. They probably thought I'd be a homeless or less worth human. Really superficial and discriminatory and sad.</Text>< pictures>

This is a fairly complete sporting goods store oriented toward outdoor activities.  Lots of hiking, climbing, camping, fishing gear here.  Not the place to buy baseball gloves, bats, volleyballs, etc. They may have some sports equipment but it's not the place to go for that.  If you're looking for a new sleeping bag, a fishing rod, tackle, or some earthquake survival gear this is your  place in Santa Cruz.</text>

< review>
Amazing customer service. Mike spent about an HOUR helping me set up the ocean fishing rod I received as a gift (I had lots of questions :) Strung the line, helped me find the perfect weights, rigs, and bait. Our 3 boys also enjoyed the attention with their many questions about everything. Mike was passionate about his job (and fishing!) and when he didn’t know an answer the other employee gladly helped find exactly what we needed. This was truly a pleasant experience in a well stocked store. Great prices and 1:1 service. Thank you!<//review>

Good place for many outdoor items but if you're near a REI I would go there and get the best in QUALITY. No comparison. Still they do have a lot of nice things!<//review>

<review>My husband and I were road tripping through California and had brought our tent along to do some camping but realized one of our tent poles was broken. We called Outdoor World to see if they had any tent poles and they did, but they were closing before we could get there. Tyrone said he would stay and wait for us, and he did. Very impressed with the customer service that was above and beyond what was expected.</review><username>Stephanie Miller</username>< UserId.>

Solid, wide selection of quality stuff for camping and other outdoor activities. Prices can be a little high, but it's nice to support a local company as opposed to buying something for perhaps a bit cheaper online. The Capitola location is certainly larger, but they manage to cram quite a bit of product into their River St store.< /Text>

The store rocks! They are dog-friendly, and have a super great selection of hiking shoes and boots. I tried on literally 10 to 20 different pairs of shoes over a few weeks, trying to figure out what was best for me. The staff were incredibly helpful and didn't mind the time it took for me to find the perfect boot! My dogs also absolutely love going in there, it is such a warm atmosphere and they even have treats! I much prefer going to this store over the one in Capitola due to selection and helpfulness of the staff. Also for the record, my perfect boot was a Timberlands 😋😃</text>

<date>1547688963606<//date><Review>Had a terrible on phone experience with the River St location's management. Brand new Red Ledge pants leaked on first wear. I called in for the return policy and was met with rude hostility and was told they couldn't be returned after wear. Called the Capitola store and customer service was 100% better with store manager Kayla. I work for a local farm and will be telling my crew to avoid this location and make the trip to Capitola. Really disappointed in the River St shop as it's been the go to. This is my first review of any service, which says something about the experience.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I love this outdoor sporting goods store I've been coming here for a very long time since the 70s that's a long time I come and get my fishing worms mostly and fishing equipment the staff are very helpful and even though this is in a strange spot and I don't know how they stay open it's a really good place to go and shop the prices are very competitive and I can't tell you how many pellet guns I've bought from here over the years ha ha since I was a kid well and located anymore but I still come and get the fishing equipment and the worms because they usually have a good stock of them and if you want to go fishing in Loch Lomond you need a lot of worms :-)< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Less than sub par. The establishment isn’t clean. A vacuum is a good thing people. Also the employees purchase all the normal human sized clothing before they have a chance to reach the rack, and are the first to admit it. I don’t think that is fare at all. I would support this business if this was not the case. Think twice about the false customer service. Hope this helps anyone who reads this.< /Text>< UserId.>

I went here to purchase a handgun. My experience was far better than I expected. The person who helped me was extremely knowledgeable and was able to offer a solution to choosing the gun I wanted. I ended up getting a better price then Markleys and a better shopping experience. I was also able to do the handgun certification test at the store.< /Text>

It’s hard to be sure, the store is so close to the homeless center, the merchandise is overpriced, the sales staff are unprofessional and lack knowledge and experience, and even basic etiquette. I have a better time at any other store,REI, Big 5, Check the prices yourself.<//text>< date>

<Review>Outdoor world is a little over priced on certain things. You should price check with amazon before making a purchase there. I really like their little camp fire cooking skillets that are only 8 dollars.</Review>< date>

I have been a customer at Outdoor World sense 1977 when I moved to Santa Cruz to attend UCSC. So I have watched this store go through all its changes through the years. They have had their ups and downs and could really use more room to display their goods. Overall it is a good store except for their dressing box (room). The box is located in the women's cloths section kind of stands alone in its space so that people can walk around all four sides. I walked into this box and felt exposed to the store. It is about 3 ft. by 3 ft. all four sides are open at the floor about 2 ft. up from the floor. It is a struggle to try on close in this small space. There are no hangers to hang your items on that you want to try on, and there is no room for your shoes in the box so you have to move them mostly outside of the change box.  I would say that they are loosing sales because people (women and girls) just don't want to step into this box and take their cloths off in such circumstances, its bad. OK thats it. Oh one more thing, the employes need to stop playing around and start helping the customers.

It is a very nice park.  There is a play area for the kids with equipment. There is a large grassy area and a walking path around it.  There is a lot of activity.  You can tell the neighborhood enjoys using the park.  There is a bathroom and it is handicapped accesible as is the park and parking area.<//text>

< Review>
I feel extremely comfortable in saying that Jr Seau would not want his kids to participate in competitive sports here. As a parent whose children are in a competetive soccer club and who practice at these fields, I am concerned that the field conditions hinder their development and causes risk of injury, which is no fault of the soccer club. It's on you, city of La Mesa. Take care of these fields which is your duty to provide.

Seau's name and reputation deserve better.</Review>

<Review>Grass and turf, basketball, baseball fields and a playground down the hill.  Right next to the YMCA too which is very convenient.  Not the easiest to park at sometimes, but there is more parking on the other side of the turf field next to the school.  Not the greatest grass for soccer, but it works.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The place is nice. But how could they have spent all that effort to build it and not put in now bleachers?!  We had to use camping chairs, but they were behind the top row.  So if see wanted to really watch the game we had to stand up.

Parking is also really limited.  We parked down the street. Others parked at Souplantation.<//Review>< pics>

Filled up. The nozzle mechanism that holds it so you don't have to wouldn't release. Gas went all over my clothes and side of truck. They should really make sure their equipment is in proper working condition. Someone could get seriously injured by spraying gas.<//Text>

They don't actually sell kabobs, they just give you pieces of meat. They also tack on an additional "livable wage" charge to all orders since they're too cheap to pay their staff. I live directly above this place and will never go back. Learn how to price your food accordingly to pay your staff instead of peddling it off on customers, anyone that lazy is clearly cutting corners elsewhere.< /Text>

<Text>The chicken seemed to not be cooked completely and was a bit bland. The rice used to have a lot more saffron (yellow grains) and flavour before but was still decent. I have been here before and had enjoyed this very same dish a lot but I guess this time it was more of a let down for me this time or maybe I came in with too high expectations. Had ordered the chicken kabab plate. Service was good and ordered fresh juice which was really nice.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I have been to  this restaurant about 5 times, mostly a  popular place for company get togethers. The venue is excellent for large gatherings. Yes they have a bars with variety drink selections. So if you  want a nice place with  food that everyone can enjoy, Mediterranean style with a bit of Persian influence then this is a place to come. They also have pizza which is average when it comes to flavor.  No wow factor in the pizza. The ingredients are good and fresh.  The service is good.  The food in terms of flavoring and execution is average. I have had much better kebabs in many other Persian or Afghani restaurants  throughout the bay area. The marination is simpler and blander in flavor than other places I have been to. But, the quality of the ingredients is good. They have good starters and finger food for those who want to just have something light and drinks in a group.The menu is balanced and does have some good selections for everyone to try. Do I crave to go to this restaurant for the food ever?  Never but if  I had no where else to go ,  yes I would come here to eat as a viable option. My rating for this place is 3.5 but I will  round  it to 4 just for ambience and quality of ingredients plus I cannot give a 3.5 :) rating on google review.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Great outdoor patio with ample of seating space.

I had spicy shrimp for the appetizer and it was great !!

I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was very  bland.

Their sampler for desert is great & I highly recommend it !!

Our server was awesome. I'd definitely come back and try another en·trée.</review></record>

Nice setting, good outdoor sitting area.  Bartender seemed a bit novice and was really slow at getting our drinks.  This is not indicative of all their servers as some seemed really prompt and senior.  Food was slightly above average but not necessarily outstanding.  An overall good experience.<//text>

Stopped here for lunch on our way to Carmel. What a great find. Staff was very welcoming and we were seated right away. They brought out pita bread and cucumber salad then an additional tray of hummus, baba  ganoush and tzatiki. Everything was delicious so far!

We ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken kabob for lunch.

The chicken kabob came with saffron rice and broccoli. Yum. Everything cooked well and chicken was tender and juicy.

Sandwich had avocado, lettuce, tomato and onion with an aioli served on a toasted soft roll. Delicious.

We were glad we made the detour here to have lunch. Yum!< /review>

This place is wonderful. I come here often for lunch and always get great food and service. Tonight I had a meeting run late and missed my train. Decided to grab a glass of wine and order the very yummy spicy vegetarian pizza which is the best! The bartender was so friendly and kind. He made sure I always had a full glass whether it was water or wine. Simply put. Excellent service. Excellent food !!<//Review>

They have private rooms in the back so they are great for group/team events.  Casual/nice atmosphere.  The din of the dining room seemed overly loud.  In the private rooms it was fine.  The food was tasty and service solid.</review>

Service is good. The braised lamb shank was phenomenal, but some of the menu items fall short.

Chicken, lamb and ground beef skewers were bland and dry.

Hendrick's gin and tonic was $16, served in shot sized glass filled to the brim with ice.  One swallow and the drink was gone.

For the price I expect more.<//text>

Here's why I'm giving this wonderful bistro 4 stars.the evening began with being greeted by an attractive, friendly hostess, who took care of my needs, the moment I walked in the door. So, that set the tone, then the food that followed, delivered by a conscientious waitress, was just awesome. If you like Mediterranean food, like I do, you'll love this place, from the ambience, to the personalized attention. Yeah. I'll be back......< /review>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Faz is alright. I was here for lunch on a weekday and we were seated immediately. The service was decent and the food came out rather quickly. I had the rolled beef kebab. I have no idea why it was called rolled beef. The beef wasn't as... savory as I'm used to and the consistency was a little too soft and had me questioning what the composition was of the meat. $15 was a little too much for what you get in return, but it's close to work so it makes a convenient lunch spot. I wasn't a huge fan of this place and wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. The flavors, quality of food and portion size are absolutely none in comparison to a place like Dish Dash.<//text>< Pics>

I and my wife have long wanted to go to this place, since we live in the apartment right above the restaurant! And finally one night we decided to turn up here. This is quite a unique restaurant in the sense that it caters multiple cuisines - Italian, Persian, American and others.

We decided to try out the chef's soup of the day - a seafood gumbo soup which turned out to be absolutely delicious. As appetizers, we tried out the combo kabab from the usual dinner menu and a kashk-e bademjan based dish from a special menu. The combo kabab had one beef kabab and a chicken kabab which were absolutely delectable, succulent and mouth-watering. One particular aspect that I noticed is that the portion sizes of the kabob plates are smaller than ones in other Persian restaurants in the vicinity (read DishDash, Chellokababi and similar ones). The special entree was a little off-key to our taste.

The service was really great, we enjoyed our time here and the interior is quite classy. I plan to be back here to try the pizzas.</review>

The food and service here is really good.  The only minor complaint that I have is that the “Greek Salad” is the American version, which is lettuce based.  In my travels to Greece, most of the Greek Salads were mainly tomatoes, with very little or no lettuce at all.  I would love to find a place that serves an “authentic” Greek Salad.< /review>

While you are waiting for your meal they have pita bread and dipping sauce to hold you over for your meal.   I have never had to wait long so I always have pita bread left.  I love the fresh juices that they usually have.  An excellent location if you work on the Tasman corridor.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

< Review>
We came here because we had a gift card. And thank goodness we had a card...it was soooo overpriced!! It was really dead for a Friday night, but the service was good. We got the Mediterranean platter for the appetizer, which was pretty good. Then we each got a kabob. The kabob wasn't bad (not superb either though), but $24 for one small bit of meat, a few green beans, and a ridiculous amount of rice?? Waaayyyy too overpriced. For 1 appetizer, 2 main courses and 1 glass of wine, it cost $88!!! Are you kidding me? And kabobs are pretty much the only main courses available. Do yourself a favor and go a little down the road to Dish Dash if you want Mediterranean food that's worth the price.< /Review>

Good food but service was meh.  It's loud inside so having a conversation is a bit difficult. So loud that I pointed to the food I wanted off the menu.  Server forgot my soup.  Said he couldn't hear me since it was too loud.  Remember I pointed to my food.  I wasn't angry but I got attitude from the server.  It also took 40 minutes to get out main dish.< /text>

Bad food. No flavors at all. Chicken was hard, rice was dry with flavor. No sauce served with the dish. After asking, they provided tzaziki. We ordered salad, they never bothered to provide plates. Very bad customer service. We had to call for everything.</review>

This place is good but not great. I say this Becuz Im right next door to this restaurant and I very rarely go there for lunch only Becuz for the price I feel as though its not worth it. But if you don't mind paying 13dollars for a greasy sandwich the by all means this is the place to go.</Review>

Very very poor service.
The waiter took 10 minutes to ask for orders, and after the starters, the entrees never came. Nearly 15 minutes later, after reminding, we got the food. Overall, the food was ok, but the service was really poor.<//Text>

We usually end up going here as my office is close by. It's a good 10 min walk which is always needed on our way back. We usually get the hummus and pita for the table which is absolutely delicious . I always end up ordering the chicken kebob and they have the option of selecting the brown meat over white...which works out great for me.
Not sure about the parking scenario here as ive always just walked to this place.
I kinda wish they had more kebob and mixed platter options. Ambience is nice and the service is always great.<//review>

Very good Mediteranian Food. New and modern place, with attentive staff. This place is large enough to accomodate  a quick business lunch and a larger party. You can sit at the bar or at one of the nicely layout tables.
Try the hummus and follow with a lamb steak. Just the right ammount of spices to hit the spot. We did not get dessert but had some very well made cappuccinos!<//Text>

The flat bread was cold and hard, we asked the waitress to bring some warm bread, waited for more than 10 mins and came the same cold and hard plate.
The battered calamari was totally plain without any flavor and  salt added, and it came wrapped under a folded napkin on the plate!!
Lamb shank was stewed only and totally no flavor at all, the mixed rice under was cold and hard too.
Filet Mignon in the Chenjeh was so well done and with totally charcoal burned veggies on the skewer.
The waitress brought desert menu and told, they did not have tiramisu and cheese cake.
We, group of 5, came around 7:30 for Sat night dinner, just us and another table of guests.  So empty, maybe that's why the moonlighting cook and bartender were on duty!!< /review>< user_name>
