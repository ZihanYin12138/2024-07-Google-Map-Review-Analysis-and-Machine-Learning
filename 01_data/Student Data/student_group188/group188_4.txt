<rate>1</rate><Review>Unfortunately, I can't recommend this winery. To be fair it wasn't based on their wine, but their lack of customer service and poor representation.

The same gentlemen that told me 5 days ago that we didnt need a reservation told me today, (after our 30 minute uber ride) that he had to be pick up something and would be there  1 hour after his posted hours because we didnt make a reservations.

I was able to validate that he was the same gentlemen who told me I didnt need a reservation and he even recalled our conversation details.

I then asked where we could go for an hour to try an work with him since we invested so much time to get to Laguna Canyon Winery.  He said you can go to the car shop, then said you can walk down the canyon to the the beach (no walking path and dangerous turns) or you can try a different. He apologized and said there was nothing he could do.

Please save yourself a trip, this winery stands alone  by itself in between auto collision and car repair shops. It's a shame that we didn't get to try the wines. I can't recommend this winery as there was no care or concern for their customers, you can't rely on their posted hours and this is a stand alone winery with no other choices.

We told our next Uber driver about our horrible experience at Laguna Canyon Winery and he apologized for the poor treatment and suggested we visit Mozambique.

The food, wine and service are amazing and the views are spectacular. Highly recommend Mozambique!!!!

I was a little bit hesitant on coming because I really wanted to go out on an outside vineyard tour with the actual grapes in line in a garden but the owner is very personable and you can tell he is doing exactly what he loves. Wine is his passion.. the way he speaks and experience, he has had over more than 2 decades in the industry. He explained how he got into it and a few other locations he has wineries in as well as previous positions he worked in that he didn’t  like before getting into this business. A definite recommend. I am from NY and was just in the town but i do plan on visiting California more often and will definitely come back. The wines were great- never had a better merlot, and he has an option for whites and reds that are filtered and unfiltered. I really thought  it was cool that he had machines and a card system keeping track of the balance we can use and dispensing the wines for us at the same time.</Text>

<Text>What a wonderful experience! The owner is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. It was a pleasure learning about the history of the winery and the process of wine making. The wine was incredible, the reserve syrah was exceptional, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.  We had a wonderful time tasting many of the wines they craft on site, and took home a bottle as well.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

My Wife and daughter had never been to the San Antonio Winery before. Today I treated them to lunch. We had a delicious meal and enjoyed the wine tasting. The owner approached our table and he welcomed us and thanked us for coming. We left with 6 bottles of wine. I can't wait to open the Chocolate Bar wine. It tasted delicious. We had a long wait in line for food, but everything was worth the wait. We will be back soon.</text>

<Text>We had an amazing visit today for our tasting. Check out the Groupon. We had a great time tasting wines with the owner. We enjoyed every taste we selected. You truly can’t go wrong on anything. Make sure to have a meal prior because the only food is the meat cheese and crackers. As it should be so you know they focus on their amazing wine. This is a must if you are traveling at Laguna even for a day. We spent about an hour here and don’t forget to ask about their membership program. Casual date day event. Will return!!!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYz6tazXcUrvUOMBh2e-O9jjQpkS8ZgxgKeCYV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCel_ZG45w1Awb2_YgWIJ5dZeU20H-NZt5JNDU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhU_ADocmTTZecGFYeVr5NwBU8Yjcwvlv_M4JD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1jl4prK_L4j5hHw7hNh2Ti7eZw3kEUZPaiwRy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTX3mMAZeTTCcs56uws5DDVSfgdUq1eyYJK6bd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNveDIbTrHfx1UKKlAMvJnvm2QNkB2dmB2QQ-_8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2xTxag9RJgmBR57LNrbyzXoUGygTP_h7PKFdH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4V3Kqgn8CpmJTWDbyu8NR4xRRvA0fO4E-h42K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6eA8c9cAOzugUTWaf8o4agpY3UcHDU_BgwkUE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG4sgt7p8WyFUGOdAlN_D4yPF9HLplEPWHnqjY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzq0_49n2J1qC_-wmcpMf44jhgd_LtGHZ2dOaw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeZ0SxbyD1g6ws0rG7ByRd9kntyeOFVBC2DXB5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwtCA-Fpn994CEJpFzw6yY5lmpEmbfGHkOYBUu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8h_f_NHqfGfcsYiYA-HqXhFKlVqK1AnII-e3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPT1FDv2e_LrZl24nYL68K_E0Q9V048oziny26s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Although the exterior of Laguna Canyon is unimpressive, upon entering the winery it is beautiful!  We were greeted by Patrick who is friendly and very knowledgeable, and we spent two hours tasting a variety of the fabulous wines, leaving with several bottles to enjoy at home.  This little winery is a Gem and we will definitely be back!<//Review>

Meeting the winemaker

We visited on a Sunday which gave us the opportunity to have a relaxed and prolonged interaction with our server, who happened to be the proprietor and winemaker.  I learned new things about wine making, was happily corrected about things that I thought I knew but most importantly very much enjoyed the wine.</Text>

Very small and decent wine. A nice time if you live in the area and don't want to drive out to Temecula for wine tasting . Our bartender wasn't very informative but all the wine information was on the menu anyway. They were out of a few different wines so we couldn't taste them<//text>

My husband and I attended a 1st Friday of the Month Wine Tasting Party that included a variety of appetizers, a super filling buffet, music and amazing wines! MANY of their wines are delicious and I'm so happy I have a new fave winery less than 30 minutes from my home.

I tend to be more of a red wine fan and I loved their 7 Barrel, Petite Verdot and Purple Paws. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn they have a raspberry sparkling. It will be a perfect addition to our holiday meals!

For $40, it was a great value, especially since we got 10 wine tasting on top of all the delicious foods. They even ended our meal with chocolate dipped cookies!!

I'd highly recommend for a girls night or date night.<//text>

On the first Friday of the month, I had the distinct pleasure of attending a Wine Tasting Event at Laguna Canyon Winery.

As I walked in the doors I was greeted by one of the owners and several staff members. I was immediately made to feel welcome and really liked the feel of the place.

We enjoyed several red wines, white wines, dessert wines and more. My favorites were the 7 Barrel, Petite-Sirah and the Tawny Port. All in all the Friday night tasting includes ten - 1 ounce flights.  In addition to this there is live music and delicious food. I highly recommend Laguna Canyon Winery.<//text>

Tatiana and Patrick treated us like royalty.  Super knowledgeable,  attentive and kind. We loved so much we bought 8 bottles of wine! Love the Rose', the Sonoma Valley late Harvest Zin is sooo good and Los Carneros Sangiovese is mouth watering.  Also love that a portion of Purple Paws goes for the care of homeless pets & it's good too! I go for Purple Paws (great gift for animal lovers that drink wine) but go to taste, you won't be sorry you did.<//Text>

< Review>
Came here past Friday night with a group of food and wine enthusiasts (EatNDrinkGeeks), for their 1st Friday of the Month Wine Tasting party from 6-9pm every month. Well, maybe not every month, but check the events calendar from their website.

It was surprisingly packed.  Outside parking was difficult to find as they share a lot with what looks like a car repair shop. Once inside, you can get 10 tastings of 1 ounce pours  and appetizers and hot food with no place to put your food. But you know what? I loved it here because the people here were super nice and Marlowe is super passionate about his award winning wines.  They've won numerous awards from the OC Fair.

They were serving whites on left side and reds on the side closer to the street. I am more particular to the Reds here because I love my Cabs. So I was able to taste their '12 Cab, the 4 blend, 5 blend, 7 blend, the syrah, and the cab syrah.  Taste wise, I personally like big, bold fruity flavors with some oak but not too overpowering. So without going into too much detail and sounding like a wine snob, I liked the 7 blend and the 4 blend the best here. It's like tasting an Anejo and a Reposado if this was tequila as the 7 was a bit smoother and the 4 was a bit younger but you can taste all the profiles.

The people behind the counter were super nice and hilarious. I got to meet Leann and Denise as they were pouring the white wines. Their Russian River Canyon Cuvee is quite nice, slightly dry, not sweet, and great on the nose with punch of fruit. Super easy to drink, probably best now.

They do all the blending in house I believe. There was a sign right above the entrance way stating they bring grapes from all over the place into here. The barrels inside the tasting room are real with wine fermenting away.  They do have a small water dispenser, which is my only gripe here. Definitely not big enough!

If you buy a wine during the event, you get to keep the etched glass.  Background wise, there was live music from Saeed Marandi. It was a fun time with fellow friends over wine. This place is definitely worth checking out when you're in the area like for SawDust down the street.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Laguna Beach is a nice little vineyard to try for $ 2, $ 4 per cup for a drink (various discounts and benefits when purchasing bottles). However, Shirah and Zinfandel do not have good gut

I ordered a spray for a loved one who was a huge 49ers fan. What better way to show love and support from a distance than to represent with flowers the same color as the family. Unfortunately, when I received the picture, I was deeply saddened. The ribbon was burgundy, not red, and there were no white flowers included. I called and spoke to the Owner which informed me that he could go pick the arrangements up. The family works at the funeral home, so they have already seen it. How rude would I be to take those from loved ones? Yes, it’s the thought that counts; however, I am disappointed that this company could not follow a simple request. For the price I paid, I expected the order to be the way I wanted it and nothing less. I won’t make this mistake again! Hopefully, I will be able to get in contact with my usual funeral florist. Even still, I won't spend my money with this post company again.

On a positive ending, I want to thank Brian for helping me easily place the order. He was professional and informative.  Also,I am thankful the flowers arrived before the requested time. I just wish they were 49ers colors as requested.</Text>

First pic is what I ordered, however ask if it was possible to make it an all white arrangement due to a cultural funeral. This is what I got. Picked up at 1:45 Saturday 7/17. This looks nothing like what I ordered. I’m even embarrassed to show up with these flowers. I couldn’t personally pick them up, but if I would have I would have asked for my money back. I will be calling on Monday. Flowers are welting, brown spots. Hell there’s more leaves then flowers. Super disappointed.<//Text>

Being 3 hours out of town, I wasn’t sure how the arrangement would look but took a chance and placed my order. The arrangement not only was Beautiful but it look so fresh.

<Review>Me and my sister ordered flowers for my aunt yesterday right after a valentines rush. They managed to pull out beautiful roses, carnations, and baby breaths for our bouquet. We brought it to the funeral and it was honestly some of the prettiest flowers there. thank you so much Chase Flowers.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My mom received flowers for Mother's Day. The arrangement included a number of roses of different colors with the center rose being of multiple colors itself. The arrangement and the vase together are absolutely beautiful!<//Text>

<Review>Called the shop in the afternoon, needing a special delivery same day. Not only were they willing to help, they were kind and considerate. And from what I hear, the bouquet was perfect. Thank you so much to you team there for making the special moment for me, I'll forever be grateful.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

This is a fantastic florist! I called this morning and they were able to deliver today, Christmas Eve. Very pleasant staff helped me on the phone. The arrangement was fantastic for the price. I will definitely be using them in the future!</Review>

I am not from the area and chose Chase Flower Shop from the reviews. I can see why they have excellent reviews!  Brian at the flower shop was so personable and helpful. I knew the order would look extra special.  Brian sent me a picture of the delivery before it was sent out and it was beautiful! My sister-in-law also sent me a picture because she thought it was an extra special arrangement.<//Text>

Nice flowers. Terrible service.

I had made 2 separate online orders of 3 floral stands for my aunt’s funeral - so 6 in total. I received an email saying that the first order could not be processed due to an issue with the credit card info so I called in immediately to resolve it. While it took a couple tries to run it through, the woman on the other line assured me that the payment went through and everything was all good. On the day of delivery only 4 had arrived out of the 6. I called the shop to see what had happened and the person whom I spoke to said that I only received 4 flowers because that’s what I paid for, but I kept responding that I had actually ordered 6. Apparently for some reason, when I had called to fix the card issue, the person who helped me only charged for 1/3 flowers in the first order. Then the person on the phone accused me of incorrectly stating my order. They kept saying I sent in four separate orders each with different order numbers, but I was looking at my purchase history on their site and it showed only 2 orders, each with 3 floral arrangements. The person went on to insinuate that I didn’t even speak to someone from their store when I had called to correct the credit card. They said the only people who answer their phone are them and one other person and neither of them seemed to recall me calling in. This boggles my mind because clearly one of my flower orders got corrected so I had to have spoken to someone from their shop?? When I brought up this fact they kept interrupting me and repeating “you got what you paid for” and considering I purchased from them because of their low prices, that statement is pretty valid. They wouldn’t even admit or apologize that an error was made on their part. Never purchasing from this shop again.</Review>

We ordered premium and they looked better than what was pictured 😁  We had set it for pick up but were unable to get it because of work so we called last minute to have it delivered and they made sure that she got the flowers the same day. Thank you so much we loved the flowers and the service was amazing! This is gonna be our go to flower shop now 🦄

Note: I also just want to say that all of these 1 star reviews are coming from accounts with only 1 review/no profile picture. I had no problem with ordering from here and everything was perfect!< /text><date>1596479052247<//date>< pictures>

I ordered an arrangement for a dear friend of mine and couldn't be happier with the result! She was so happy with them and kept saying how pretty they were! She sent me pictures and I was also impressed with the design elements and freshness! Hats off to the designers, staff, and delivery drivers who helped me make her day! Thank you, Chase!< /Review>

Chase Flower Shop is amazing. I'm from Milwaukee and placed a online order blindly for a Valentine's Day arrangement. Everything went flawlessly. I advised that the arrangement needed to be there by 2:30 PM and it was delivered on time. She loved the flowers!!! The delivery driver was also very polite. Thanks again Chase Flower Shop you've gained a new loyal customer.<//text>

But, Chase was so awesome and did wind up delivering them today after all. I am very happy with their service and the prices are very reasonable. My awesome mom loved the arrangement as well.

Unfortunately, arrangements on their website do not match what they deliver. Delivery was on time and flowers looked healthy but rather expensive for the size and overall look of the arrangement.</review>

Very disappointing place will never order again. People clearly do not read the notes.  And the gentleman on the phone needs to learn a little bit more about customer service  Extremely rude and does nothing but make Excuses for their actions. Just a heads up people if you want to order some flowers For a surprise good luck to them actually getting delivered to the person they're supposed to be. 😢🤔😤< /text>

Very unhappy with their service. They charged me twice, refused to take ownership of the mistake (blamed it on the website...), and refused to correct their error. It's a shame that a local business would refuse to help a neighborhood customer. Mike needs an education in customer service. Shame on you.</text>

On April 1, I received a tall, exquisite arrangement of fresh, beautiful flowers (roses, lilies, sunflowers, gladioli, carnations) with lush tiny "filler flowers" in a sturdy, attractive clear glass vase from Chase Flower Shop. A dear friend (former math student) had sent it to me to mark the beginning of Math Appreciation Month, and Chase made sure that the number of each type of flower was a Fibonacci number :- ) Not only do the arrangers know their flowers, they know their math! ;- ) The flowers are giving me much joy! Thank you for doing such a lovely job, Chase!< /Text>

I live out of state so I ordered an arrangement by phone for a funeral.  The employee who took my order was very cordial, efficient, and a pleasure to work with.  I was unable to attend the funeral but I was told by family that the flowers were very beautiful.   Thank you, Chase Flower Shop, for doing a great job!<//review>

<Review>Chase Flower Shop has been my go-to florist for a few years now. They can do everything from standard, traditional arrangements to highly original and creative floral designs. When it came down to booking a florist for my wedding and reception, I consulted with the owner, Michael, and he didn’t disappoint.  Our color palette was basically cream, blue and gray. Michael’s deep knowledge of flowers was evident in his range of flower suggestions that would work for our wedding, the outdoor locations, AND the potential weather - heat and sunshine can change things really quickly with flowers!  And when we wanted a nod to the color gray and something to represent my husband (with flowers!! How do you do that?) and he came up with a thistle - purpley-gray in color and definitely a humorous nod to my husband’s personality! It was an original touch that a truly creative florist can give.

The arrangements, bouquets, and boutonniers were perfectly designed, delivered on-time by his terrific staff, and a highlight of my wedding day. If you’re looking for a true floral designer to work creatively within your needs, Michael and his team at Chase Flower Shop are highly recommended.< /Review>< UserId.>

This place is horrible. Their customer service is in the garbage. I ordered an arrangement that I found on their website and didn't get what I ordered. I called to let them know and the guy said he can give me 10% off. Doesn't cover the $15 delivery charge!!!! Then I sent the pictures of what was online and what I got via email. Called the guy and asked if he got them and he said what do you want me to do about it we are busy I can't take you any flowers. Told me he didn't know if he would get back to me today after five or even tomorrow. Called back and got a lady and she handed him the phone he was rude once again and hung up! Will never use this flower shop again!!!!! I highly don't recommend them to anyone!!! Poor customer service and poor design of arrangements!!!!!<//Text>

MICHAEL THE HELLO GUY!!! You called me yesterday about the order my wife placed for her mother while my wife is deployed for this past Mother's Day. You told me that you are out of stock with the specific flower that my wife ordered and that you would gladly send a different one. I told you I had to talk to my wife  there is no way I can contact her but she can contact me. Just a moment ago, I called supposed agree with your proposal. I called and a lady answered. I told her the situation and she transferred me without telling me. You picked up and you said hello and i said hello back. You repeated the hello and I repeated hello, I tought u cant hear me so I  asked "can you hear me?" and you said hello how can I help you and I said hello again, I asked you reapetesly and you didnt answer my question. We kept going in circles until you hanged up. I called back and the lady answered, I asked her why she transferred me. She said you supposed to help me. I told her "i dont think he can hear me," thinking that it was bad signal. You answered and we hello again with each other in circles until you mentioned sir. I was surprised that you can apparently hear me but you chose to be belligerent for no reason. Your excuse is that "I asked you how can I help you, didnt I?" while laughing!!! I went ahead and cancelled the product and thankfully I know now what kind of service you are providing. YOU ARE A DISGRACE!!!!! My wife didnt tell me which flower shop she ordered it from, but I figured that with the same rude respose you posted to those customers that posted complaint, that this is the shop. I verrified with the phone number!!! I will make sure I talk to many of my friends and family about your custumer service. Is that how you talk to grieving family that you provide service to? Disgusting!!! FYI I admire your facial hair and your style! I just wish you are not a jerk!!< /review>

We try to provide the best possible service to all our customers, no matter what technical problems they are having with their phones or whatever difficulties they have with language issues. Mothers Day is our very busiest time of the year and we always try to do our best to satisfy as many customers as possible, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, I am mono-lingual as are most Americans. Usually this is not a problem, with a little patience and good humor on both sides we are able to overcome language barriers. I am very sorry this was not the case for you, but was very happy to refund your money.'}<//Resp><gmapID>0x809467503e561663:0xf9308f110d82a253</gmapID></record>

The flowers that were delivered are nothing compared to what I ordered. The guy that answered my calls was rude and didn't care about my concern. His excuse was "flowers are different in nature" so does that mean the pictures that are posted are decieving? Not a company worth anyone's business!<//review>

Good eats. Menu is a little confusing bc of the font & layout but fits the theme! Clean inside, employees were nice, service was a tad slow. Ordered fries, tacos, pretzel and churro.< /text>

Fun treats but service is very slow and rude. Showed up at 3pm as they opened and had to wait 20 min for a funnel cake. When I asked why I had to wait so long I was given a lame duck excuse and an attitude. After a verbal berating from the "owner" I was asked to leave and that I was not welcome back. Definitely not the way to treat paying customers.< /Text>

Read the reviews and went there. Waited over ten minutes for the full order.. funnel cake got cold and when I asked what was taking so long, the owner said “this is not the place for you.” So I got my money back.. bad customer service. I guess it’s not the place for my money either. Would give 0 stars if I could<//Review>

<Review>We were forced to sit 3 people at a table that’s meant for 2. The table was too small for our food and drinks to fit so we had to put our drinks on the floor. They refused to allow us to sit at larger empty tables that remained empty throughout our entire stay. The owners daughter did not smile. Was very rude and had pops customer service. The waitress even said she has an attitude problem to us when we asked why she was so rude. I spent well over $200 on food from this business and will never in my life come back. My sisters shrimps had WASTE in them. My daughter paid $5 for a tiny amount of butter sauce and $1.75 for 1 egg. You can get far more at Cajun crab just up the street for far less. Not only that but they don’t even offer you gloves and a clothing cover. It’s not required but most seafood restaurants have it available because SEAFOOD IS MESSY. Instead of focusing on being “boujie” maybe you should focus on training your daughter and find better vendors so you give people the amounts they deserve.

Update: came back to try their salmon hoping they corrected all my complaints. My order of the lobster tail was raw. The first time I tried
This place, a family aside from me complaining about raw salmon.

This place is not sanitary. I should call the
Health inspector.</Review>< pics>

If i could give it a zero i would. The food is not only overpriced but comes with terrible/unprofessional service. Not to mention, the portions aren’t at all worth the price. To top it all off, when i got down to one of my last shrimp they weren’t even cleaned properly. I can still see it’s waste in the line of the shrimp. 0/10 would not recommend.< /Review>

<Review>Don't know if I was the first in line yesterday, but the people show up here! While sitting outside waiting for my order, the smell of garlic hit my nose and I no longer wanted to wait for her to call my phone to tell me my order was ready ... its my food and I want it now!! But I waited patiently none the less. The drive home was the longest with this hot bag of deliciousness on my lap. I ordered the boujie lobster bowl (my sister talked me into trying the hard boiled egg with my order.) I'm not an egg person but baby let me tell you... get the egg with your order. The cajun seasonings didn't hit me so hard while eating but after was a different story. I know now to ask for a few extra lemon slices in my order.  I'm definitely going back.

<review>I ordered the snow crab and shrimp bowl the potatoes weren't cooked all the way. I ordered the lobster mac n cheese the small portion was not worth $15. None of the food was worth the it. They made us pay a tip before we left and the owner showed up with her bodyguard to get us to leave after our 2 hours was up.</review><time>1613947874330</time><user>110289354908208290036<//user></record>

The parking sucks so prepare to hunt for street parking. Due to Covid indoor seating is unavailable but you could see that it’s a beautiful restaurant inside. I ordered the shrimp bowl (which is close to the size of a panda bowl from Panda Express, which is pretty small for a Cajun bowl... as well as a soda which they forgot to give me). The food plus tax and 15% tip came up to $35. Which was bizarre because I only got a few shrimp, a few sausage, and 1 corn cut into quarter pieces in a small bowl. In my opinion they need a larger portion and more flavor to match that price. It tasted okay but I prefer the Cajun bags and green sauce from Let’s Sea Bag and Roll. That bowl with the missing sprite was not worth $35.<//text>

So I finally tried their seafood bowl!! Super disappointed. When I called I asked if they take phone orders she said yes. At the end of the call she then tells me that I will would have to tell them the order again at the door and pay before my order is placed. What's the point of the phone order then? After waiting
a hour to receive my order. I was extremely disappointed the sauce was horrible I don't know if the seafood was covered in lemon or vinegar!! I asked the person who took my phone order if they had a garlic butter option or just the signature Boujie sauce she assured me that the sauce was a garlic and butter base. I ordered some fries cold and greasy. I won't be back!!!<//text>

{'time': 1615045330927, 'text': 'Hi Daniel and Kristin, I apologize for your inconvenience surrounding your credit card, unfortunately we do not use your information to place orders from other businesses nor do we write down any ones personal information when processing phone orders. Daniel order a Shrimp Bowl with a dinner roll. Her card was charged for only that amount. You guys called the next day wanting to speak to the owner regarding transactions being made on your card at other businesses. I was the one who took your call. I first went through my order log to make sure we only charged you for the order from Boujie Crab. You confirmed that was the correct amount. You then stated your card was used to purchase items from Loews and a hair store online. I asked what proof do you have that the card was used  by  one of my staff members. You said it was traced back to Boujie Crab?? I asked you how was the payment traced back to Boujie Crab could you provide the IP addressed use when the order was placed online.?? you said No! You said the orders were gonna be delivered the next day at Boujie Crab I asked you to provide me with a tracking number or an order confirmation you said you didn’t have that information?? I asked you to call each business with me on a conference call to see what was ordered and who placed the order and where the order would be delivered you again said no?? You said you called the police I said that’s fine, if a delivery is to get delivered I will contact the police when the packages arrive also.\nNo deliveries came Friday and no delivery notes were left on the door.\nFirst off if someone placed an online order with your information they would need your full street address to input in that website ordering portal. When we capture your information over the phone we only ask for your street number.. the name of the street is not needed. We input your information directly into the payment processor and the only information we are allowed to see is the receipt and the last 4 of your card for proof of purchase.\nBefore you accuse my establishment or my staff of stealing information please be sure you are accurate and correct about what’s going on with your card purchases. You just made a public statement accusing my business of fraudulent using your friends credit card and that is not true. Legally I can sue you and Daniel for Defamation of Character . Be very careful of the businesses you try to hurt with false allegations...'}<//Resp>

<text>My daughter and I ordered two crab bowls with eggs, which were $1.75 each egg!

Ha, what a markup.

The sauce was $5 extra. It was ok. Nothing special.

The corn was sliced into quarters from a  half. The sausage was ok, not great.

I like patronizing Black owned businesses but appreciate MY patronage by not price gouging me.

The food was mediocre, at best. It looks much better than it tastes.

Not that it was bad. Just not great.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>IN FULL DISCLOSURE: I patronized @boujiecrab for an early dinner tonight and I am disappointed to say that I was underwhelmed. Pros: the decor looked really pretty, from what I could see through the window. CONs (1) I ordered the cat fish dinner and I got ONE catfish and cold (undercooked) French fries for TWENTY TWO DOLLARS, (2) my catfish was NOT fully cooked (it was slimy in some places), (3) the wait was OVER AN HOUR, not the 40 minutes I was quoted, (4) the bag it was delivered in was DIRTY and I was not given any sauces to dip or drench my fish in (i.e.) cocktail sauce, hot sauce, etc... (5) The person who took our order outside was nice; however, the presentation (attire) was not professional or at the least presentable. Some “may” get offended that I would draft my detailed experience and some may not (feel free to be who you want to be), but I make it a point to go out of my way to PAY your rate and ENJOY my food. And I’m sad I could not enjoy my food AFTER I paid YOUR RATE. I only eat seafood (no meats, so I look forward to my meals these days). #oneanddone< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Very disappointed in the food very pricey and portions very small the sauce needs more spice less grease with all the garlic still no solid flavor  I will say catfish was ok but due to know ventilation the fish and fries were soggy probably will pass on future visits</Text>< Pics>

Hello everyone.. I highly recommend this store. Reason?? My alternator for my truck got damaged, and I went to the store and show the picture of of it. The guy told me that was one they sold. I Started to remember that I replaced it long ago. They checked all my purchases from my record and yes!!! It was with warranty. I save a good 💰!!! Keep your receipts. And phone# it's helpful.😀😀<//Review>

I know I had put in one oxygen sensor on the car and therefore the second one needs to be put on I think it's the lower oxygen sensor b. Anyhow they will work loud enough to help me and assist me in what I needed to find.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Always have a good experience at OReillys. People are generally very helpful and kind. There bational data base could use some work though. Had an expensive part that went bad and had to call the original store I bought the part from to get a record for the warranty. The manager helped though and we made it happen so that was good!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The female manager i needs to be fired! She gave me attitude and started yelling at me saying she doesn’t care because she doesn’t know how to manage a store. I called and sat on hold multiple time back to back and they kept hanging up on me after holding for 5 minutes each time and every time I called back they gave me attitude this whole store should be fired they are all clowns and don’t know anything about automotive parts!< /text>

<Text>💯✨🥇🏅THE #1 BEST🏆AUTO STORE IS... O ☘️REILLY !!💯✨ because this store is outgoing friendly knowledgeable & nice when i call for a part or have a question they are always willing to answer any questions and with the quickness! when I called AutoZone  right now they were rude n didn't want to really give me information on parts and really one worded responses so OREILLY is MUCH better than AutoZone in every category!🥇🏅🏆👑< /Text>< Pics>

<user>106902819274319922376</user><resp>None</resp><Text>Well to start the service here made me feel very unappreciated as a customer. I walked into a empty store thinking I should get service quickly. I was wrong. The two employee's stood around talking to each other. Once I got noticed Marco's a nice looking older Hispanic man approached me and I asked him if he could look up a car cap. Apparently it was being his capabilities because he required me to bring mine. So I went out to go get it. As I come back in he is helping another customer. I wait patiently even though it wouldn't even take 20 seconds for me to be back. The customer was his friend and they talked for about 10 minutes. The dude just came to pick up a can of compressed air. Best thing was he paid in coins..
So I finally get my chance and the guy brings back the wrong item even after I explained to him 3 times it was the gas cap I needed. The workers here are absent minded and rude. I didn't think it would take so long to get something so simple.< /Text><username>Blank _<//username>< Pictures>

I only leave truthful post and im very dissapointed with my neighborhood store. Go to another store plain and simple. I called in for a heater hose removal tool. "Alex" the store worker had no knowledge of the tool which is ok and not a problem but instead of getting me over to someone with a little more knowledge like i asked he asked me to wait on hold left me hanging and i had to call back and he told me the line got disconnected. ive been coming here for years and that doesnt happen. When I called back he insisted and insisted that i come down to the store to see for myself because he was unsure of the tool. I asked again to speak to someone else for info because i needed the tool to be able to drive my car and he again refused then I askes for his name and to speak to the manager and he then hung up on me.

<time>1486919805474< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Bye far the worst experience ever bought 2 batteries at the store in woodcrest but they only had 1 in stock came to this store to pick up the other one walked in there was one guy on the phone talking to what it seemed to me like he was talking to his buddy . Never once acknowledge that i was standing in front of him and said anything like hello can u Give me a minute . After 10 minutes of me standing there looking trew the oreillys AD i interupted him and i asked if there was anyone else around to help me he said theres someone in the back go ahead and call him went towards the back and said excuse me anybody here noone responded when i started walking back to the original guy that was still on the phone.  A guy came out and instead of saying HI" how can i help you gave me a dirty look i said im here to pick up a battery that i purchased at another store . Then the guy that was still on the phone said oh its over there gave me my battery and said nothing . Horrible customer service maybe because it was on sunday but this store defently needs a manager onsite or more training in customer service. I would never ever come here ever again next time i will wait till my local store has it or can get it .<//Text>< pictures>

This had to be the first O'Reilly that I have a complaint about their customer service. When you deal with a customer, you look at them when speaking to them and don't hand me my receipt like your dismissing me.</Text>

<Text>These guys are awesome. 4 new tires for $350 out the door. I was getting quotes from $600 to $800 from the mainstream big guys. Local small shop, you should support them and save some money as well. I've been coming here for years for all my fire needs.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Love this place. Been going here almost 25 years. Great deals on used tires. Dependable tire patches and plugs. Killer prices on new tire packages. They have a life long customer here.</text>

My dad went in to have his tires changed, they charged him, never gave him a receipt, and never changed the tires either. Told him that they did and sent him home, once he got home he notices that they didn’t replace the tires. Had to go back in and they refused to do a refund or actually change the tires this time, told us that since we didn’t have a receipt they “couldn’t” do anything. This place is a scam that thrives on stealing from people. If you can afford any other place, please go there cuz here you’ll only lose ur money.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><name>Kamuri Spears<//name><Review>I was directed to this tire repair shop by a friend. They give excellent customer service as well as offer great rates. If you are from the bay this is the place for you. I ran over a nail unknowingly went there to have my tire changed and they fixed my same Tire for less than $10. They only accept cash , which is my only issue because I rarely carry cash.< /Review></record>

This place is my go to for fixing or replacing tires. They are so popular that there is typically a wait... but never too long! Quick,  efficient, and they take good care of their customers!<//text>

<text>Been going here for years but had a bad experience my last time I bought a set of tires. There is a tool you use to take off and install the center cap that covers the lugs. I showed the guy taking off my caps the tool. I told him  this takes off the center caps. He told me “I got it, I figured it out” since he was a tire guy I trusted him. So my new tires were installed I drove off, I got home looked at my tires, noticed 2 of my center caps were missing. I drove back to the shop and found them in the street. Went back to the shop and showed them the damaged caps. The installer said “oh how come you didn’t tell me?” Pretty much tried to blame me, even though I tried to give him the tool. They said they would try to find me some I left my number. They never called me and acted like they didn’t even remember when I came back to ask them. So I’ll never come back! there are other places that offer the same prices.< /text><Time>1518533794105<//Time></record>

First, they won't lie to you and tell you that all your tires need to be changed. They were honest and told me exactly which were bad and the ones that only needed patches. Secondly, they are so fast! They changed my tires in less than 5 minutes!! Overall, very friendly and trustworthy. I HIGHLY recommend.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I've been coming here for years and I've never had a problem with any of the new tires that I bought in here. Costco wanted $667 for four new tires on a Ford Expedition. I got four new tires at the shop for $460. Not to mention everybody is nice and will stay open late for you.<//Review>

This is my go to tire shop!  You can get a used tire mounted and balanced for $30.  If all you need is a tire, you wont be there an hour, and I had 4 tires removed from rims that wouldn't fit on my truck., then mounted on rims that would and spin balanced for $50</Text>

Love my local tire shop! They always fix/plug my tires for $5 . Heir prices are cheaper than most other shops
Its $15 by my job
This place keeps me rolling without purchasing a new tire before it is time.</Text>

I called got a quote by phone and when I got there they changed to something different,  which I didn't care only a five dollar difference, but when I saw the tire they wanted to give me  I just could believe it, it was completely bald on the half way in, it was a junk tire so I left and bought a used tire at America's tire for 34 dollars and was almost brand new. This people have to pay for fake reviews because I just can't believe they have almost all positive reviews, I could have went to Walmart and got a new tire if I had the money, beware and look at the tire before paying or else they will rip you off.< /Review>

I went to this place to get a tire. They pointed out that two other tires were damaged, which was very helpful. After a few days, I got another flat, but the team here fixed it for me with no issues! Thank you so much!</Text>

<review>Took my car back in to get the front tires rebalanced for the second time left without a hubcap on wheels that are very hard to find a hubcap. Owner denies says he put them back on himself. They don't come off by themselves.

Went back today for a flat repair on one of my brand new tires which they performed by inserting a plug. I asked won't it need to be rebalanced I was told no the plug doesn't weigh anything so I drove away knowing this was wrong and the car of course was bouncing. I took it to another shop paid $15 to have it balanced and now it's nice and smooth again. The funny part is I was the only customer they had when I went in there and I would have gladly paid him to rebalance it but he wouldn't do it<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

This store was only a few minutes from my home so I gave it a shot.  They looked pretty busy when I showed up but were very friendly and were able to patch my tire in less than 15 minutes for around $5!  If you go, make sure to take some cash because they don't take cards.</text>< rating>

Another one of the few bars in Yreka. Cool atmosphere. Karaoke seems on point here.

Try the PAINKILLER drink.< /review>

<Text>I don't go to bars often, but there wasn't anywhere to sit on a Saturday night and it wasn't for lack of room.There just weren't enough chairs or tables. Pool table the the back room wind have been nice if there were less people. Single bartender working hard to keep the regulars glass filled.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Fun place very local but welcome anyone! New owners doing some remolding of some sort.

This bar has a long history in Yreka and some historica pictures to view as well.

Very clean even though it's aged.<//text>

I asked for a fruity drink and I got a drink that tasted like sour patch kids, loved it! Bartender was friendly, and all the other guests were having a good time. Decor is old school but fun.<//Review>

I love the Chile Colorado burrito!  All authentic Mexican food and they also have groceries there. The staff is really friendly! Not to mention their chocolate covered strawberry cheesecake is to die for! They have alot of selections in the bakery and alot of choices for Mexican sweetbreads ! I give this place 5 stars! You definitely won't be disappointed! They also have different locations by I like the one here and in Riverbank CA.<//text>< Rating>

<text>Bought some caldo de rez to go the lady who was working behind the food counter basically gave me water. It was very bland and expensive too. She didn't even ask if I wanted more meat or vegetables she basically gave me something to drink and not to eat. This place used to be good but idk what happened. Everything here is also very expensive. Go to a regular store for groceries. No competitive prices only money to be wasted. If I could give zero stars I would. Never coming back here ever again.</text>< pics>

Great place. The food is delicious, the prices are great. Last time I got a Large Powerade for 99 cents. The atmosphere is great, but if I had one small complaint, it would be the look of the registers, but other than that, it is an awesome place that I love to shop at.< /Text>

It was quite.  Clean, but stil over priced.  For some reason Hispanic stores are always over priced. They bet on Hispanics not leaving their comfort zone,  so they over price everything. Will only shop once, twice a year for the most part.< /Review>

I love there service in the meat department. What I don't like is the rude cashiers they have in this location. They always look like there in the worst mood. The people in the bakery are so nice and polite. The have good deals on the meat here.<//Review>

Every time I call them on the phone to ask if there Western Union is open and what time do they close, I call to get that information before I drive all the way there. So, when I call they give me the wrong information. I get to La Perla Tapatia and the lady that works in Western Union left early. I drive all the way there just for them to tell me to come back tomorrow and they have their nerve to tell me that I should have called first and when I let them know that I did called, it seems like they don't believe me. They should have accurate information for customers.< /text>

<Text>Bought pork ribs (which they counted out) and they were too spiced. Gave me less than half a spoonfull of beans. Also got the caldo de rez and it was super salty. Had to add water myself. They got lazy and used baby carrots and the meat was really dry. Would not go again.< /Text>< pics>

Rip offs. Ive  had a bad experience the multiple times I've tried this place out. getting a burrito, they were trying to charge me extra for stuff that wasn't inside the burrito. While Weighing meat, they will put their hands on the scale making it heavy and trying to charge me extra. It always seems like they are trying to rip you off if you're not paying attention. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

<Review>Both times I came to the counter no one was there. I had to call for someone to come and help me. I had reservations and came near my reserved time. When the associate came the first time she was very friendly. The associate on the phone when I returned was also very friendly and helpful. I prefer to receive a receipt upon returning a car but did not.</Review></record></dataset><record>

If only the lady were available at desk at the time of my scheduled pickup. The desk was empty and there was no way to reach her. I have had the same experience twice but today was insane - waitied for more than 30-40mins only to be told that there are no options for the requested Car today. I would not like to visit this place again.< /Review>

<Review>The staff at Avis (Embassy suites, La Jolla) has been super rude and never available at the office. Especially the staff on Thursday. One need to call after reaching the Avis office and wait for more than 30 minutes. I've been facing this issue for last 2-3 years. This time she had another cars on lot but forced me to take a van while I had reserved a full size car. I wanted a smaller car which she also had a few.<//Review><user_id>100215210275424801403<//user_id><Response>None</Response>< Name>

Conveniently located small facility. I was satisfied with the car selection and the condition in which I received them. My only complain is the mysterious "Be back soon" message which doesn't seem to follow any specific pattern (has happened a couple of times now, once from 12:35- 1:10, lunch? and another time around 3 pm) and one can end up waiting for 30 mins or so.
It would be useful to indicate lunch hour or specifics on the website hours.< /review>

This location while convenient for its location does not follow procedures of walking around the car to check for damage, checking the gas gage or ensuring the car is clean inside and out. I do not plan on renting from this location or the Chula Vista location again.<//text>

<text>I have never given poor rating on any service places. The phone line does not work! I could not reach this place to get information about my reservation for the whole afternoon. Trying to get an idea of what kind of cars will be available to see if there is enough space for large luggages. So I stopped by instead and the line of customers already waiting swamped the only service rep available. I waited for 10 minutes, and line didn't move. I had to leave because the desk was closing at 5PM.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>We have been renting from Avis and this location has been the worst.
The Avis Rep at the location are not courteous and they try to rent out the cars which are not cleaned properly or not even cleaned in first place. I was offered a car which had leftovers from the previous rentals. I had to pick a car which had battery problems and in the end had to waste 4 hrs of my time waiting for the roadside assistance. In the end they are not even apologetic of what had happened.
Avoid this place if you want to have a trouble free rental experience.<//Review><Date>1452804730829<//Date>< GmapID>

People here are very friendly. But be prepared sometimes you have to wait for 5-10 mins as they will not be available at the desk and might be checking the cars in their garage.< /review>

You need to visit Wild Oak.
They have so much to offer. No place like it.

They make their own Tie-Dye shirts and other clothing in house.
The collection of incense is mind boggling.
Plus so many items you will find no where else.

Every time I visit, it is all the great memories from the seventies flooding in, and creation of new memories.

I wish there were more stars to give.

This is a family owned business of over 25 years.

The owners are the most honest people you would ever hope to meet.

Do something for yourself and feel good for awhile and visit The Wild Oak.

Easy to find. Right across the street from the old State Theater on Oak street.

Thank you,

I hate to write this part. These are my opinions and observations.
Investigate for yourself. You will be glad you did.

Also:
Please don't tailgate
Use turn signals
Stay off phone.

Love life 😘< /review>

I bought a t shirt, and a few rings and something for my female friend. I loved the little shop. The prices were great. And yes, both of us will be going back. I will introduce the shop to several other friends and family members in the near future. It was the first REAL HIPPIE STORE I've been in since I was a Hippie in Height Ashbury.< /text>

Very cool store. I went in there about 7 weeks ago a got a reed for my daughters musical instrument. Then 3weeks ago for disc for disc golf. Almost like a Wal-Mart but exactly what Wal-Mart doesn't carry.</review>

<review>Great store. They do their own tie dye shirts, pants, dresses, sweatshirts and onesies. They also sell jewelry, records, wind chimes, frisbee "disc golf",and lots of other stuff.
The owners are great. They are helpful and nice and will even do ear and nose piercings.< /review>< Pics>

I decided today, I am never ever buying anything from Walmart again. I wanted to purchase a new cell phone from this store because my boyfriend just got good deals on 2 phones he recently purchased from this store. I have been trying to call for weeks to make sure the phone person was in the store and nobody answers. I called corporate, who answered right away, and they couldn’t get through either. So I took a chance and  drove 25 minutes to this store. Walked up to electronics and there were two employees standing behind the counter. Must of been a rare occasion since my calls were never answered. They told me the phone guy will not be there for another 2 hours. I explained to them that maybe their phone system is down because that is exactly the reason I was trying to call. Walmart makes a fortune, you think they could pay people enough to want to work there. Get new managers.<//review>

Great food. Fried chicken sandwich is really good. Tasty burgers too! Don't forget your Gallon of A & W Root Beer! Togo line took almost a half hour. But worth the wait.<//Review>

I don't normally shop at Walmart except for a few items like Coolwater Cologne. This huge bottle pictured I believe cost a little over $50.

I recently bought a Dodge ram with a diesel motor in it in Louisiana and drove it back to Southern Cali.

The original owner gave me the service records and in that was the Walmart receipt for the 2 huge batteries the truck uses.

It was just under 3 years from date of purchase which was at a Walmart in Florida. So the invoice had someone else's name on it,  Louisiana address with a receipt from FL.

I had to argue with them a little too get them to re test the batteries because they used a handheld load tester... after removing the batteries and testing them on a bigger load tester they confirmed the batteries were toast.

They took my paperwork and got new batteries in my truck and didn't question anything on the paperwork. It says right in the invoice that the warranty is non transferable.

Anyways that's my experience with Walmart.

Hope this helps!< /Review>

I've gotten addicted to going to Walmart over the last few years... they have all my essential needs plus everything beyond those needs to spark my curiosity or pick up a new hobby! I have literally spent HOURS in there!! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because every time I've had to call about a specific item or issue,  it was truly a waste of time.  Either no answer at all or got put on hold till I would hang up or they would try n push me off onto someone else who didn't have an answer for me.<//Text>

Good friendly customer service. Pharmacy opens timely with longer hours compared to CVS pharmacy in Target across the street. Pharmacy provides helpful reminders about refills with cost, pick up time,  and option to choose an earlier pick up time, all through text messages. Clean with lots of stock on the shelf, or order online and pick up at store. Positive experience and would highly recommend it.< /text>

<review>Had a really difficult time with store help who was lazy, incompetent and rude.
Product selection, and stock levels were a big problem as well as items not entered in the SKU/Inventory System which I was informed was my problem to fix by losing my place in line, running to the back of the Store and verifying pricing by taking a photo with my phone. I asked if they could instead radio to have someone else nearby (who actually works there) walk over and verify instead. Cashier and Supervisor literally refused my request. I was frustrated but not rude or irate, so I can only conclude that this behavior was motivated by some form of discrimination instead. (Nothing unheard of in my world as a trans person but it was still really surreal and hurtful).< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>1< /Rating>< user_name>

The outside pick up is very efficient. The employees will ask you about your order before you even make a call to the number listed.  They always have the orders ready on time and each employee always greets you with a Good Morning or Afternoon and say a parting statement once your order is loaded!</review>

<Text>It was what is to be expected of Walmart. Overall, the store is good, provides quality at a very affordable price. But for some reason that seems to attract a rather questionable crowd. I see it time and time again, there's always something notable that I see a Walmart customer do, Everytime I go. I guess you could chalk it up to being shopping with an aspect of entertainment.

Overall, for the savings, definitely recommend the store. Staff I encountered were friendly and helpful< /Text><username>Ryan Moody< /username>< GmapID>

<text>Must not treat their workers well because the guy in the Walmart vest told me he didn’t work there. He seemed to hate life. Personal problem?

I've never waited in line for 40 minutes for just one item at any walmart, which was a bottle of Stella Rose Moscato, the employee at the self checkout said I had to go to the only two registers open & I can only go to the cashier that could authorize my alcohol purchase cuz the other cashier couldn't, I felt bad for cashier cuz she had  two people with full carts of groceries.<//review>

I went in, picked up bananas, laundry soap and my new fitbit.  Joseph at the electronics department was very helpful, knowledgeable and extraordinarily flexible as he multitasked as he was the only one manning the department.  While I selected my item, he assisted customers,  ran them out, then took care of the line if customers waiting to pay, assisted someone with their large purchase, came back and continued assisting a new line of customers that gathered whole assisting the last customer with their large purchase; all the while, checking the telephone that rang almost non-stop.  He seemed calm, as he took care of all questions and assisted us all with getting products from the locked displays and making small chat with us all and thanking us for shopping.  I wished him a great day as I I paid and left, and added that I hoped he would get someone to come help him out soon, he smiled and agreed.</review>

Oh dear, the folks working the auto service are doing their best, but the processes are cumbersome and few clerks have been there long enough to know the details. Kudos to Jorge, however, for his insight and competent handling.
BTW, don't bother to call this store - I was in phone-purgatory over an hour, even though my "call was important ". So it goes.</review>

I came to purchase some Christmas candy and the aisle was blocked at both ends.  I asked if I could get in , mind you I was in the electric cart which didn't work, and she was rude so I asked the other lady and she said she would move the pallet and let me through. I know it is a busy time and you need to restock shelves, but your customers are important too.<//Text>

They are always available and I drive from Escondido because our location never has spots same day or next day. I appreciate the workers from the Vista location a ton! Thank you for your hard work! You give me peace of mind and a break from grocery shopping with my two kids. I am so grateful!</review>

<Text>Cheap, loads of selection, but dont go there if you need a fishing license. Waited over 20 mins and still non one bothered to come to the camping counter. We gave up and left.  Shame.

<review>I love Walmart, at 1800 University Dr. Vista?, Ca. 92083.
However, I tried to return my Bissell Crosswave but the printer was down.
Then I tried calling to find out if Returns dept's printer had been fixed. I called 5 x's no one answered. Then called back and a fabulous lady (Judy Ann) and she tried 3 x's to get someone to help me. She couldn't get anyone to respond.
So I brought my Bissell in to see if the thermal label had been repaired. Label printer still hadn't been repaired in over a week.
I spoke to a young man about how printer and when will it be back online? Customer Service person didn't answer my question because he was more concerned about the Bissell wasn't in the box. I told him I was in earlier and the ladies in Customer Service said not worry about getting Bissell in original box. I explained this to the young man and he told me he won't except Bissell out of box. And then he dismiss me by calling the next Customer. I have never had a run in with employees or customers, until that particular day.
I came into Wal-Mart to personally thank Judi Ann and brought her some flowers because she sincerely tried to get me help.
I notice since the Covid customer service has taken a different path. I understand that front line workers are exhausted and having to deal with unhappy people. I always do the bulk of my shopping here at Wal-Mart. If your customer service suffers and
I am treated as though you don't need my business, I can go to food for less.
Sincerely

The most inferior delivery service that I have ever encountered. They don't show up, they don't answer their phones, they deliver spoiled food and then you have to fight tooth and nail to get a refund. I strongly encourage you to take your business elsewhere.</Review>

I have been coming here since before it was a regular Walmart . And I actually voted for the city to go through with making it a SuperCenter. And I’m glad I did ! I come here with kids and I always feel safe shopping here. I’ve had a few close calls with my son running off and I can’t find him and they instantly shut the store down and reassure they can find your kid. It’s always clean and organized! All the staff here is amazing ! I always find someone to help me find something I need. I started doing Instacart two months ago and this one of my favorite stores to shop at ! I love it and if your new in down come here ❤️🌸🌸Best deals in town period !<//Text>

Only problem I had was that in the return center, there's a sign that says that they accept returns without a receipt, but when I tried to return a cord, they said they needed a receipt for anything from electronics. Not a huge deal, but it was pretty misleading. Also, when I bought the cord, the employee gave me the wrong type. My fault for not double checking, but still frustrating.<//text>

Many items that I was searching for were out of stock, nobody came to open the pet meds case when I rang the buzzer, we were followed by their "secret shoppers" who were so obvious and the register line was well over a 20-minute wait due to the cashier making a mistake untilO they opened up another checkout for us.< /review>

<text>Worst experience at a Walmart I have ever had. I chose this Walmart for my grocery pickup because it was the only one that had a same day appointment. My appointment was 6-7. I drive 45 minutes to this Walmart, and at 6 they notify me that it’s going to take them a little longer. At 6:30 they have someone come tell my groceries probably won’t be ready today and that we should cancel my order. I had to drive 45 minutes back to my house with no groceries. Wasted over 2 hours of my time and couldn’t get my groceries.</text>< pictures>

<text>I've been to many Wal-Marts all over the west and this one is by far the worst set up.  There is something to be said for "flow" and intuitive set up,  this store lacks both.  Nothing is where it "should be".  Hard to explain until you've experienced it.  But it's the closest one so I continue</text>< Pictures>

Was happy with all the selections they have for any of your needs. Great prices, great items, great fruit/vegetables/meats/ ECT..
You and check out this Walmart you won't be disappointed. When your inside you will see how much there is to see and buy with a great price. Great staff too. Loved their self checkout 🙂<//review>

Just went there for a couple things. One, for a drill in the hardware section. It was understandable that it was busy, but still, i could've been acknowledged by some staff to be let known that they were with another customer and itd be a few minutes...but i wasn't. I waited for 20 minutes, only for no one to assist. I grabbed what I have selected previously, paid for my items and left sans drill. I get it, its Walmart, but at the very least, the customer service could've been better< /review>

You have to go to other departments in order to find someone and have them call for someone to help you in the department that you request. Then you have to walk back to the department you were originally in and wait. This can easily take a lot of time especially if you require assistance in multiple departments.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>2nd time here, love the store..only gave a 4 star review because the employees were not friendly only one said hello and she hadn't attempted to run me over with the equipment like the other 3 employees. I will still shop here just have a lower  expectation for any pleasant interaction.</Text><rate>4< /rate>< date>

This rating is in regard to it's grocery pickup operation.  Sadly Walmart is broken when it comes to online ordering with curbside pickup.  Excessive outages of common food items coupled with a disfunctional curbside delivery process.  Terrible experienced.  Won't be using it again.<//review>

Walmart is Walmart. You have your good days and bad, and when you have a website specifically dedicated to the customers, & the employees,.... kinda says it all. Regardless, we shop at Walmart for the convenience and the prices.< /review>

Called ahead of time to ask what time they would stop doing wireless services. I came in three hours before the time I was told and they had already left. I went to multiple Walmart’s and was told to wait until they came back from lunch. Which I did but they never showed up.< /text>

<Review>Had a grocery pick up order to pick up and there are only a handful pickup parking spaces available. We had to wait in a line in our cars just to park in the pick up parking for 20 min.s then the wait for our items was at least another 10-15min.s.  Very unhappy with the service and the quality  of the items chosen for my order. I purchased a large ½ salmon file and when i got home realized that it was split open all the way down the side and it smelled horribly like rancid fish. I tried calling multiple multiple multiple times and every time I was hung up on transferred or no on ever picked up. I didn't have the time to bring it back or the patiemce to bring it back.  Ended up trashing it and throwing $$ money in the trash. WE WILL NOT  SHOP AT THIS PARTICULAR WALMART EVER AGAIN.<//Review>< time>

First time here. 3 Wal-marts in one day looking for a few dining canopies. None of them had the $49 special so I ended up buying two $79 canopies. I'm happy with the purchase as they are better quality and white as opposed to blue so they should reflect more heat. They are also vented at the top to help prevent toppling in high winds. There were three customers in line ahead of us and it took 25 minutes to give them money.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Even though Walmart is a huge store, it is managed well. There was not only tape on the floor at checkout, there was also an employee reinforcing the distancing, plus signs on the clothes display stands asking shoppers to keep 6 feet apart.
Everything was clean and items put away. The only thing that was frustrating was that the dressing rooms were closed off, so you couldn't try things on, plus there were no returns. They were really keeping things clean.... But I didn't buy any clothes!< /review>< Pics>

Looks clean but not sure how often they are wiping /disinfecting the front register areas? Sort of scary because customers are constantly touching the key pads! Clerks still nice and helpful, as always<//Text>

Called store to verify what time they opened on a Sunday and due to covid-19.  Website stated 8am...waited until then and called and called and called auto center as well as store and no one answered.  Had my car towed to shop only to find out they didnt have the necessary tools to take out a stripped lug nut to change my flat tire...ugh!!!<//Review>

Even though Walmart is a huge store, it is managed well. There was not only tape on the floor at checkout, there was also an employee reinforcing the distancing, plus signs on the clothes display stands asking shoppers to keep 6 feet apart.
Everything was clean and items put away. The only thing that was frustrating was that the dressing rooms were closed off, so you couldn't try things on, plus there were no returns. They were really keeping things clean.... But I didn't buy any clothes!<//review>

This Walmart doesn't seem too interested in social distancing or keeping track of just how many customers are in the store at once or sanitizing carts, surfaces etc. If you're immune compromised or just trying to be really careful w covid, skip this Walmart.</review>

This store was busy, as it's in a shopping center. It had more items that the other Walmart stores near me. I like them for this reason. They are seldom out of stock, the management does a better job of stocking the store than other Walmarts in the area.</text>

Not a big shopping crowd on Thursday afternoon. Still no flour or  sortment of beans. Open and those items I found everything ready and available I just didn't like that I had to do my own check out. Thumbs up to the cashiers who work so that we may be able to shop.<//text>

I arrived for my 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. pick up at 4:14 and checked in. I received my groceries at 5:57 p.m. Neither the grocery pickup nor the customer service department picked up my multiple phone calls. I usually use the grocery pick-up because it takes 2 to 5 minutes to receive my order. I called Walmart headquarters to report the terrible service I received, and will not trust the Vista location again to fill my order.< /text>< rate>

< Review>
Have always been treated with respect by the staff. However I am a high risk cardiac Senior and am supposed to be quarantined. But I have needs.  By the time I get to the store on university most necessary items are gone. It’s not Walmart’s fault, but any suggestion is welcome.  By the way Sam Walton was a friend of my family in Newport Arkansas.  I’ve met him many time.  He was a good ok’ boy.</Review>

I made an order for pick up. And did not receive an email that it was ready. I Tried Calling the Pick up Department  Several times and no one is answering I've been transferred to customer service just as many times and no one answers and there either.
How are you supposed to resolve an issue if there's no one there to help your customers.< /review>

<Text>I checked in and after 10 minutes, I notified an associate that I was still waiting to pick up my order. They supposedly called someone. After waiting another 5 minutes and nothing happened, I stopped an associate walking by and requested they either get my order or cancel it. Only then did I get any help. There was another customer that came after me that waited 10 minutes until she was helped. This is unacceptable. I went across the street to Target to pick up an order. Not only was I in and out of the store in 3 minutes, but they had reserved parking close to the front for pick up customer. This is Real customer SERVICE. I won't be ordering any more pick ups at Walmart after this treatment. What a terrible experience!!<//Text>< pics>

Two stars ONLY because the employee in Pickup was excellent and I apologize to him now for not remembering his name. On the other hand, I called the store because I couldn’t reach the pickup department and the employees who answered after 10min of the phone ringing had horrendous attitudes. Will not be coming back.< /text>

Store deserves 0 stars. Called the store 8 times tonight to speak to a manager, only got a live person once and sat on hold for 15 minutes. Tonight was just another bad experience in the store. Myself and another customer waited at the jewelry counter, had an associate called 4 times iver a 20min period. I left empty handed as much as I needed an item tonight for Easter, I couldn't wait all night. Every time we enter this particular store, it's a bad experience.
In our country's new normal of cleaning and social distancing, Wal-Mart doesn't very little in protecting its customers. The do not clean the carts, self checkout is not cleaned regularly nor are the key pads at the regular registers. They do have signs on the floor to keep distance but no one regulating it making sure people leave space. Unfortunately, Ive had to enter Wal-Mart on a few occasions but prefer Target who cleans after every guest, every register, ever time and regulates line control much better on top of cleaning carts as guest walk in the door. Even Stater Bros marks which carts are clean and which are not.
The parking lot is too dark and unsafe. Spoke to the manager months ago and was advised they were working on it but still dark today. The staff is not friendly or customer service oriented.</Text>

Most everyone knows "Wal-Mart is Walmart"... They are the same everywhere... to a lot of people they are very convenience. Maybe the majority of people. Unfortunately when Big Business comes in to your town it tends to put some of the little businesses out of work. Well unfortunately this time Walmart didn't have what I was looking for. The drive doesn't bother me...  it's not that far but it looks as if I'm going to have to get online and order what I wanted... even if it is from Target! That won't stop me from going back to Walmart and looking at the fishing gear. They have pretty good prices on that.</Text>

< Review>
Ordered a bike online & shipped to store. They offer bike assembly, so I requested it. They wrote my info on the box but gave no receipt. They said they would call me when they schedule the assembly. Now it’s been several days with no phone call and I can’t get anyone to answer the phone for 3 days in a row at Walmart. When the call finally kicks over to operator, she just sends me back through the same line and i hold while it rings forever. She can’t even get a manager to pick up. I’ve called during “non busy” times according to their website. I’m so frustrated!< /Review>

It's Walmart!

What do you need? Roam around the store or ask for assistance. Walmart peeps are helpful and some are quite smiley. Who doesn't like smiley peeps?

Get yer stuff and go - Walmart!</Review>

FIVE STARS  Vista WALMART! In the last two months,  I have made quick grocery store to home trips. Betw.the Oceanside stores and Encin Walmarts, I have poured down the sink at least $140 of ordinary traditional milk with  exp dates of 14 to 18 days away.  Most likely milk  got stuck for hours in non-refrigerated areas during transport to store or prior to being put in the Walmart dairy walkin-refrigerator.  I repeatedly tried Pickup--Service. No matter what time of pickup,  these other Wlm were out of ordinary milk and no substitutions. (I also would go in--no milk, too.)
THANK YOU VISTA WALMART.  I have always been able to come in real quick and find ordinary milk in half gallons and quarts. Each time properly refrigerated, too.  This has been a problem with V grocery chain, too, at certain locations. No, I did not go back each time with my receipt and empty milk jugs.  Its been many weeks,  I have only been able to leave the house  no more than 2-3 times a week for groc or pharmacy only. Thus, I have enjoyed the feeling of driving outside and my short walks in the store. THANK YOU VISTA DEPT. DAIRY PEOPLE--Each of you--at different levels. The refrigerator shelves are clean. Glass doors clean. The milk is properly stocked and rotated. I purchased product I could rely on. Thank You.< /Review>

It's Wal-Mart.  Get in and get what you need and get out.  Checkout is always slow but luckily they have self-checkout.< /review>

Came in thru garden center and I was looking for something an employee notice my confused look and offered to help. She was very polite, courteous and helpful. Second time  I've had this experience here with 2 different ladies one was from the garden center the other from the medicines area. Great job ladies!</Text>

<review>It is what it is but removing one star because stock is never maintained, they could actually sell more if they just put stuff on the shelves. This location is actually better than others too. Nothing worse than going to a commodities store and the common thing you need isn't in stock<//review>< username>

<text>I am not gonna say anything bad about this store the people have so so people skills, and try to help you the best they can. Mostly friendly, but it took months to fix the bathroom problem they had, if they ever fixed it haven't been there for a while. Does anyone know if they fixed the bathrooms finally?< /text>< Pics>

Stay in the service line so you are seen in this order you came. I didn't get the job order out into the system before others that came after me because I was waiting in the back.  Their 30 minute service focus doesn't start until you're written up, so get in their  system quick.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc75b26992381f:0xee60197de9274d9c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'd like to see the "CEO types" scanning their merchandise, watching a toddler, watching your purse/phone, look up item and bag your purchases.
Maybe you should give a HUGE discount for doing ALL of the work yourself!
4 cashier's on a Sunday afternoon, really???? Not a pleasant experience!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Completely disorganized and never anyone on makeup.
Edit: The cashiers specifically turn the bags away so you are more likely to leave bags of items behind so they can reshelf and resell the
Use items. The few times you catch this, they always get an irritated look. This time, left $30 of movies, 20is of home office supplies and eggs which he shoved probably all into one bag and then didnt turn the bag holders</Review>

Disorganized, employees need better training, and this corporate giant needs to pay their people a higher wage.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

As far as Walmart goes,  this was a nice store. Clean. Well kept. And I stayed 1 night in my RV. It was quiet all night. Easy in & out, but not right on the highway or busy streets.< /Review>

<review>Great store very honest staff I had left my wallet in the shopping cart a while back and didn't realize it until 20 minutes after driving off, I drove back to the store thinking the cash I had in the wallet would have definitely been picked out, if not the whole wallet dissapeared without any note of...but I went to the customer service desk & to my surprise; my wallet was returned to me with all of my cards, cash, and change intact and not a penny less....which I am so grateful for. The lady at customer service told me i am lucky that an employee had found it before anyone else had got to it and  lucky I am. So Very damn lucky. Thank goodness for this good honest employee! 🙌👍💯🎉🏆 The one thing I could ask of this store is to widen their variety of products in the garden department, since they didn't have any selection for cactus' or succulents. But other than that -thankful this stores employees have morals and have always had a pleasant time visiting here 😁😋< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

This order was placed online.  Total for the items was initially ~$29.  The order wasn't allowed because it was < $30.  After doubling some items, the order was accepted.

Default for online orders is store pickup.  Order was changed to deliver.  Pickup orders have no added cost.  Delivery orders of $49 get a ~$7.90 charge.

Pickup was available same day. Delivery was available next day or any day of the week.

Placing the order is simple find and click process.  One click gets a quantity of one. I didn't try two clicks.

When the order is created clicking the quantity number increments the quantity up or down.

Order pickup happens at the Pickup Door.  There special parking spaces with signs that point the way.

To know when the order is ready, they send a text with a reply link.  Clicking the link will open the Walmart App so you can let them know you are on the way.

I don't have their App so showed up at the planned time space.  A man came out and asked my name.  He then went back in and return 10 minutes later with the order.

This approach can keep the shopping time to 30 minutes in my case.<//Review>

Went into the store today and was refused beer sales because it was past 10. I have been into this Walmart a thousand times I've bought beer at 5 minutes before 2. Who the hell does Walmart think they are limiting people's beer sales. Hey the law says alcohol is for sale until 2 a.m. what would also be helpful is that when you call to speak to a manager about your inconsistent policies that you actually answer the phone< /Text>

Patrons of this Walmart  were being besieged by 2 different solicitors, one using a small boy to hesitantly ask.for donations while the adult sit on a chair reading. I would recommend that this Walmart no longer allow this practice . Several other Walmarts in No. Co. no longer allows this practice.  I have no ideas who these people were...or if they were legitimate  representatives of legitimate  charities.  At least one group..perhaps both...gave me doubt.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I don't know why this store let's everyone and their brother bring their dogs to this store....if it is a service dog then yes I completely understand.....but every person just just HAS to have their dog with them is ridiculous and VERY unsanitary. ....there are laws about animals and food I see dogs in carts upon every visit....and most ARE NOT trained service dogs or therapy dogs.....a trained dog will not bark,growl, snap at people or jump on people etc....they will not pay attention to anything or anyone around them except their owner....
I have spoken to different employees about this and have been told that they are supposed to be telling people when they come in they're not supposed to bring their pets.....and YES you can ask for proof....according to a friend who was training a service dog in this state the owner and or trainer is supposed to carry the paper work on them at All times....< /review>

Don’t bother calling this store for any information they don’t pick up and I tried all departments.... why in this day and what everyone is dealing with would they make it to where customers HAVE to come to the store to get any questions answered.

It was 8pm and There was no shopping carts available because they were sitting out in the parking lot. When I told the greeter, he seemed surprised but not very helpful. Several of us had to go retrieve them ourselves. It was just odd.  Also, I've noticed that check-out takes forever. Cashiers don't have a sense of urgency to ring customers up like they once did....<//review>

<Text>Love this Walmart! We live closer to the one off Nordahl Rd but that store is so broken up in sections it's frustrating. That one also has too many people and it seems darker and it's not as clean as this store in Vista. I don't know who runs this one in Vista off sycamore but it's always clean, staff helpful, cashier's friendly and not congested. A well organized easy follow store. Fully stocked which is another plus. Even the parking lot is clean and there are always baskets available.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc75b26992381f:0xee60197de9274d9c</Gmap_id><user_id>111761402135391987470< /user_id>< pics>

< Review>
There are some charitable organizations that deserve attention and contribution so they can support those in need, but allowing soliticitors for donations in front of a commericial  store people patronize is not a good idea. Patrons of this Walmart  were being besieged by 2 different solicitors, one using a small boy to hesitantly ask.for donations while the adult sit on a chair reading. I would recommend that this Walmart no longer allow this practice . Several other Walmarts in No. Co. no longer allows this practice.  I have no ideas who these people were...or if they were legitimate  representatives of legitimate  charities.  At least one group..perhaps both...gave me doubt.< /Review>

You never really appreciate a Walmart Supercenter until you have taken a British family in the middle of the night.

The sheer amazement they displayed just illuminated how jaded we are, taking for granted the ability to get whatever you want, whenever you want.

This clean, well-organized consumer nirvana boggled their minds. It was a privilege to introduce low budget wretched excess to well-heeled Brits. We all had a blast.</Text>

<Date>1543802773592<//Date><Text>7E2B30: I like Walmart in general. You can always find most of household things there at good prices. I like the location of this Walmart. I typically get my water softener salt from here, which I usually am not able to find at other stores. Home Depot do have it but Walmart has better prices.👍🤘

Great convenient place to get quick supplies and food items at great prices. Convenient hours. This also one of few places where I find the Morton's 40 lbs bag of salt for water softeners in the area.< /Text>< pics>

<review>I was picking up a few things in the grocery area. Couldn't find the cocoa.  Found an employee stocking in an aisle.  Asked him where I could find cocoa.  He told me aisle 17, and pointed me in the right direction.  I found what I needed, and went back to the employee and thanked him.  A little bit of kindness goes a long way.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< Review>
Bought a furniture piece here, walking around triing to find someone to come help us out, talked to two diff employees who said theyd call someone to come help us but noone ever showed up. Husband says hello to a passing employee thinking he came to help but he totally ignores him. So we just decide to take it away with an abondoned trolly nearby. Once we get to the front husband asks the ticket scanner if we just take trolly out he says sure someone will assist us outside. Noone shows up. Husband loads furniture himself. He came here from work and was very tired. I understand Walmart doesnt pay their employees much but their also full of lies, least they could do is just direct us how to get the piece out without waiting and confusion. This will be the last furniture well purchase from here.< /Review>

Oil change and tire rotation. Oil was done quick. They took a while on the tires but still done in 1 hr 20mins. I do have a truck with 31 inch tires so maybe nobody jumped at the chance. ;) If you shop it will go by quick. $71 out the door, high mileage synthetic oil. Fram filter.<//review>

The layout and placement of a lot of different products is not like your typical Walmart or any other store. Staff is for the most part friendly and courteous. I don't usually enjoy my visits here because I feel like I'm going crazy just trying to find what I'm looking for.< /review><date>1534099491741</date>< response>

Who doesn't love Walmart?

I love browsing with friends for the newest tech or just run a speedy grocery run for anything and everything I need.  This place is very economical and carries great products!<//Text>

For this place to be as busy as it was I must give it 5 stars. Busy but clean and staff helpful. Shelf's, food, fruit, clothes, cosmetics and all looked well put together nothing was laying on floor or out of place. Garden section for potting plants was extremely small.< /review>

Outstanding selection of products. Store organization did not match with the WalMart APP, making finding the Wilton 8-inch cake pans difficult.  A store employee was helpful.</Review>

Brought 2 boxes Thermacare on June 23re at Vista store location.  When got to my family's home I noticed that they charged me for 3.  Is impossible to get anyone to answer the phone at Wal Mart.  I live out of that area. so huge inconvenience to get this resolved.  Look carefully at your receipts before leaving a Wal Mart...something I should have done in retrospect.<//Text>

<name>jaames ritchie<//name><date>1562972725748<//date><rating>1</rating><review>Went to this wal-mart for an oil change. After getting home I decided to check the oil and just as I suspected it was low. Turned out it was a half quart low. I went back to wal-mart and talked with the service manager and showed him on the dipstick how it was not full. He said it was in the safe range and if I wanted it to read full on the dipstick it would cost extra. I thought I was getting and paying for a complete oil change but I guess at this wal-mart they have figured out a way to short change the customer in order to make additional money. The manager was rude and when I said I would contact corperate he said fine as they won't and can't do anything about it? He runs this store. So buyer beware at this wal-mart location and you probably should go elsewhere.</review>< Pics>

<review>Brenda was my cashier lady and she was funny and very kind! It was closing time and I was last to check out she never once made me feel rushed, like I was a problem, upset her for having to stay after her scheduled shift! She was kind, helpful, had a great personality for it being midnight! You should be proud of employeesmlike her because they are a diamond in a rough sea of grumbling, complaining, rude, unhelpful, disgruntled employees normally that work at wall mart!

Thanks Ms. Brenda! Keep doin you and good will follow!<//review>< Pictures>

Completely out of disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer. Asked if they put limits on how many customers could buy like Costco does and they said No. Really? There's no comparison. Walmart is out of control.< /text>

I do need a fluffy blanket in such cold winter. The first time when I went there, I found one I like and ready to pay it. But I failed to scan it successfully because this item is on recall.. that's fine the assistance came over and brought it back. One week later, I suffered in the cold and decided to shop in this walmart again. I found the one I tried to buy last time was still on shelf, at that moment I thought it's ok this time maybe I can buy it. And then in the self check the same thing happened. The assistance brought the blanket back because it's on recall. I have to say that fluffy blanket is my favorite style in walmart.. if these items are on recall why the people working there put these blankets on a shelf for so long time.. this is my worst experience there..<//review>

Between the constant out of stock basic items, the aisles being blocked by rude workers putting up stock, being aggressively solicited for donations at the entrance by people literally standing next to the sign proclaiming "distraction free shopping" and the fire hazard of a line caused by the ridiculous receipt checks at the front door this is the worst wal-mart I have seen in the country.< /Text>

<Review>I have been going to this store since I was a kid. I have had no major issues with this store until recently.  Over a few visits, I have noticed a recurring issue that I find completely unacceptable. I have found myself being stopped at the door to get my recipe checked often. That would not be a problem if I have noticed that only people of color were being checked. I initially thought it may have been coincidence but after multiple visits it continued to happen. I even asked my family if they had a similar experience and they agreed, the same happened to them. I find this sort of thing to be extremely wrong and unacceptable. This has most often been seen with I somewhat bald white fellow. I no longer shop at this store.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>Always seems to be crowded & parking is tough. Not enough handicap spots. They don't seem to restock very efficiently. There's only good air conditioning in the grocery section of the store. Some isles barely have room for 2 carts to pass each other especially if it's a family with several kids. While other places in store have plenty of space. Not well planned out.<//Text>< pics>

You have to love the super centers they are so much better than a basic Walmart they provide you with food you don't have to go to two stores and I can just go to one and get everything you ever needed one shopping trip all in one stop< /review>

Sometime your team worker don't bring smile rhe customer mostly your back team members and one young lady was not smiling she a bit to pushy and didn't pack the item in my sister personal bag. So you manager need speak with all your team members and how to handle their customer's according I hear a lot how Vista Wal-Mart are bad with customer's and bad in not having items on self we go back couple time each day to see if you have them and not on self so rate you a ( 2 🌟).< /Review>

Very rude staff at night. Possibly racism again,  I've experienced that here before with daytime staff. I'll stick to shopping in the South Bay from now on. This is why I commute 100 miles every day, instead of moving to Vista. Racism seems to reign supreme.</Review>

<review>It started by calling this place to see if they even carry the product. I waited maybe 5 mins before getting a person (which wasn't the right department) then waited another 2 mins and received no help. So I went in to take a look for myself. I walked to the maybe right aisle and ask a associate that was stalking near by if they carry what I was looking for. After some exchange of words he couldn't help or maybe it was because he was listening to music while I was asking questions I don't know. Anyways hes calls another associate over to help me. I tell him what I'm looking for but he seemed a bit confused(I don't blame b/c I don't think people normally buy this product a lot). Anyways he gets the idea of what I'm looking for and walks me to a section. Before leaving me he says " This is all we got and I think this is what your looking even though YOU WHERE TELLING SOMETHING COMPLETLY WRONG AND DIFFERENT". With a zombie smile he walks away into his work day. Not getting help on the phone and being insulted at the store  is what will continue to keep me away from wal☆mart.
I swear.....< /review>< response>

<Text>I get my grocerys with the grocery app here alot. Usually it's great. Sometimes the food can be less then desirable. But again it's usually great.

Shopping inside here is a little cramped most days and worse if you need to get things across the store.

The parking lot is usually filled up too. People speed through the parking lot also.

I do love that shop in app then pick up feature to avoid all the hassles.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc75b26992381f:0xee60197de9274d9c< /Gmap_id></record>

I came in with my walker, which I should use sporadically until I get a wheelchair (I have a sprained left ankle and a broken right foot -just discharged from hospital after surgery). All of their electric chairs were out of order. My friend happened to spot a wheelchair behind the customer service counter and we borrowed it to shop and pick up my prescription. I was lucky  to have a friend who could drive the wheelchair, otherwise I would have had to leave.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Very rude staff at night. Possibly racism again,  I've experienced that here before with daytime staff. I'll stick to shopping in the South Bay from now on. This is why I commute 100 miles every day, instead of moving to Vista. Racism seems to reign supreme.<//Text>

To complain is really a waste of time. Too many Pros & Cons for them to care one way or another. One person walks out happy one person walks out mad. Evens itself out. We leave sometimes frustraited, and they still make bank. However, when it comes to Auto Service, our 2nd biggest investment, a little pride in their profession is in order. Bbb right ups may get someones attention. When it comes to Automotive Service/Tires there is no room for error... Safety 1st</text><gmapID>0x80dc75b26992381f:0xee60197de9274d9c<//gmapID>< user>

<review>I visited this Walmart at about 10:30 p.m. I didn't expect much but was pleased to find helpful and even friendly employees, and the products I drove up from Solana Beach to find. I also really appreciated that they're open 24 hours because it enabled me to purchase items (like a network router) I otherwise would've had to wait until the next day to buy at a Best Buy. And I got an excellent product at an excellent price.< /review>< Pics>

Their AUTO CENTER is a NIGHTMARE!!!
Gabe, the manger, appeared SNOTTY when I stopped him from letting more air out of my 44 PSI inflated tires (he told me all about how he couldn't and I shouldn't over-inflate (my 44 PSI rated) tires...the "new guy" came out from the pit and I asked him..."how many grease zerks did you find"???...he told me, my vehicle doesn't have any, after I explained to him that a grease zerk is that fitting you connect to the grease gun...the old white guy was my next choice...he already knew I have about 4 zerks under there and he took the new guy down again to show him where they are...meanwhile I was inside telling Gabe, I would be telling some people about this neglect, LIE and cover-up by Gabe himself!!!
Why bother commenting???
Because the last time I was in that particular auto center (over 2 years), Aylene was also there and she reminded me of an old Harley gal, who runs the old garage her old man left her, way out in the middle of nowhere!!! It was a scary experience then and is even WORSE TODAY!!!
Norman, the old white guy...was the only type who should have been working there!!!
If places like Walmart, want to allow this to go on...we're doomed!!!</review>

Made a trip here today because the pharmacy told me on the phone that they had all three of my wife's prescriptions in stock. Arrived 30 minutes later, and learned that two of them are special order only, and are never kept in stock?! Should have gone to Walgreen's.</Review>

This Walmart doesn't deserve any stars. Only 1 register open. Employees don't know the difference between zucchini or a cucumber.  And shelves are NEVER RESTOCKED.< /Text>

Don't know if I'll shop there anymore.  Had 2 coupons one for Orowheat bread and one for Vaseline Intensive Care lotion.  Scanner wouldn't take either coupon even though both said for ANY of their breads and lotion.  Told cashier to keep both products as they can no longer over ride scanner in store.  Bad policy as coupons have been used before for the same products.  Walmart is losing out to Amazon.   They may want to reverse this new policy to keep up.  I'll shop at Winco which I prefer anyway.  They accept these coupons with no problem.</review>

<text>More like 0 stars. Called to ask If they had an item in stock. All they need is an SKU to look it up they proceeded to ask other questions about it instead of the SKU . The sku will give you all the info !!! Helloooooo. Then asked for the price once I gave them the price they said nope not going to have anything that price. Wwtttf? Just look up the damn SKU !!! Not the brightest bulbs working in electronics.</text>< Pics>

They are always out of the ice cream great value you'd think keep that brand isn't it there's. Today I was trying to exchange a size 8 tred safe shoe for a size 7, they wouldn't do it because the computer said they couldn't, this place is a joke if any locals want to get even basic stuff they go to the college ave one now that's a supercenter. This is just the same old Wal-Mart..sad I have to live next to the failed one<//Review>

Worst Walmart I have ever been to. Use to be a nice store till lowlifes decided to shop there. Now its like an indoor swapmeet, (not literally) but its bad now. Its always super crowded. Also when I mention swap meet, its because so many people have stolen from there, that now if you buy make up you have to wait in a line and pay right away, if you want electronics same deal, if you want a cheap pair, (less than $10) pair of binoculars from sporting good you have to wait in line and pay. On top of that all your other items,  you then proceed to the front of the store and wait in line again to pay. Then the kicker, you then have to present all your reciepts (more than 1) at the exit in a line once again for an employee to check that all items were purchased. When you have more than 1 reciept the employees also get confused.  I know its not Walmarts fault but its no longer a nice shopping experience.  Way to go low lifes of vista, thanks for ruining your own community.< /Text>

<review>I can belive why the manager GABRIEL  and ALL the people work in the tire deparment dont go to the school to llearn what tire measurements are sharable to put them in the car, because they do not know any tires, you know  how many people put larger tire sizes on the car and do not stick in the chassis and they are afraid to put a larger measures,one inch tall or hight up is good but  they dont know anithing of  any tires ,, one star is to much for them,,,,</review>< rate>

<text>Horrible customer service! Never will go back!!! Experienced the worst service "Claudia" Customer service manager. You need to go get some real customer service  training.  I used to spend money almost everyday in your store...added my pass receipts and on an average I spent over $500 a month. Work hard for my money, just because you have good deals, doesn't mean you treat customers like you do. And your head managers Vicki and the Mexican older woman management were just as rude. I have spoken to others about my experience and they to have had similar issue also, especially at this store!!! Now I'm curious to read the other reviews below that have been posted, because a 3 Star is too high for your store!</text></record></dataset><record>

The whole store is being reorganized and feels more spacious and not as claustrophobic in the aisles.  The checkout area also has more self checkout lanes so the lines seemed shorter than usual.< /Text>

I sure wouldn't go to the vision center, they sold me anti glare on my glasses, now they are foggy and not clear.  It's been over 60 days so they won't stand behind them,  After going to 2 other optical centers I have been told the problem is the anti glare coating and the glasses are to small for the bifocal, I have to tip my head down when trying to read closed caption on tv, driving is terrible since they are not clear any longer<//review>

Went in to pick up our online order and the guy cancelled our other order on accident and now they cant do anything about it. They didnt have the order we originally came in for, so now were leaving with nothing and a cancelled order. The Managers are completly clueless also. Hes like uhh sorry theres nothing we can do now. Typical.</text>

Look this is all really sad because up until this point I have been a fan of your store. I called the Walmart on university in Vista Ca to see if they were going to have the Galaxy s3 phones for AT&T for the black Friday sale at there store. They said they would have them. On black Friday I went to there store at about 10pm I told the employee that I was there for the phone they advertised and I wanted to know where the line was for them. I was the first one in line. They told me the sale did not start till 5am I said OK I was doing the black Friday thing and I would wait until then.Around 4:30am they finally say they do not have the phones NOT one phone for the sale they advertised. I had to go through this whole big thing with a number of their rude employees. Finally I got to speak with their manager which was rude also and the first thing he said to me was "I already know what you want and I can't do anything about it" I explained to him how it was not fair for them to make me wait all that time for something they did not have and that they could not just advertise something they would not have. He tried to tell me that the ad said until supply's last which is fine except I was the first in line so they did not have a supply to begin with. After going back in forth with them they said they would give me a rain check on the two phones I wanted to buy and they would call me as soon as the phones came in, could not give me a time because they did not know how long it would be. I said OK that's fine with me. I was calling them asking if they had the phone 3 different time after black Friday they said no every time. I call them once more on 12/5/12 and they tell me they called me Friday the 30th and left a message saying they had one phone for me and that I needed to go before 12/01/12. They NEVER called me and I can show them my call log AT&T provided for me. So now all the good sales on the phones everywhere have ended and they wont give me what they promised.This is very upsetting one of the worst experiences with any store I have ever had. How can they say they will have something on sale and and not have any, and worst promise to fix it and lie about that too.</Text>

Even as Wal-Mart customer service goes this specific Wal-Mart rates exceptionally low on customer service. Absolute worst. Manager is MARCELLA, so we were told. They seem to change frequently - no wonder! The customer service here is a joke and a disservice if anything. I've recently dealt with a Supervisor ROGELIO who was just a jerk. He told me "I don't care what the Walmart website says (and I showed him specifically what I saw) it's incorrect." Then after wasting time coming up with random dismissals of my proof, he took great satisfaction and smiled for the first time in an hour, at disproving my claim (quoting their own website) and pompously walked out of the customer service area with a smug sneer. What a jerk!
ROGELIO is just one in a LONG line of rude and less than helpful employees at this Wal-Mart.</Text>

Never enough registers open. Constantly disorganized. Produce not fresh. Aisles are crowded and hard to maneuver. Cashiers are poorly trained and management does not assist them. Items randomly placed throughout the store and hard to find. I've been to many walmarts in my life and while the majority of them are pretty bad this one stood out enough for me to write a review!<//text>

<Text>Horrible experience with the people on the pharmacy, my father is diabetic, he lives in Orlando FL.he was visiting me, but he needs to get his glucose stripes, this people just wants to sell a new machine, they didn't want to call wallmart in Orlando to get informed about his situation or if his insurance will cover the product. Very unethic, rude mean, they do not listen to the patients,better if. They get a job on a car dealer. Shame on you! Walmart!!! I use to sent all our patients to them, not any more.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Date>1400034941247< /Date><Rate>2< /Rate><Text>I have been a shopper at this Walmart for ages. Its a 'not bad' store. I had a bitter experience today and perhaps this gave me an opportunity to write about something that I always wanted to write for, but for I had a soft corner, but today was just hopeless "Customer Service". I went to the store today (13th May 2014, 5:30 pm) to pick up an online purchase. Waited near the online pick up for 5 minutes and no one came by. I checked with one of the employees who was sorting out the returns in the back and taking them to the shelves, he told me to stand in the 'Q' for returns, I asked him again and he said those guys will help you out. I stood there for 30 minutes and when it was my turn I was told to go back to where it says "Pick up your order here". When I was sad over the wait, Glory,  the Customer Service Manager just told me to go and stand there. No apology..nothing. Glory sorry to say, I oberserved your behaviour many times and you don't deserve to wear the badge "Customer Service Mgr'. Not eve anything close to that. You are a shame.
Melissa bad behavior:
There was a senior citizen, Lady 60 plus may before me in the Q for returns and I think she stood there for 30 minutes or more and when it was her turn to be served, Melissa who was the counter made a hand gesture calling her to the front. Are you serious??? Grow up Melissa. Walmart is cheap for prices not for cheap behaviour. You will be that age one day. Shame on you.
Bottom line, Customer service is just aweful, hopeless and cheap.

Glory, Melissa, Marie, Vicki, Koree grow up. You don't work for Goodwill shop you work for Walmart and we pay money for goods. You don't do stuff for free.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have been a shopper at this Walmart for ages. Its a 'not bad' store. I had a bitter experience today and perhaps this gave me an opportunity to write about something that I always wanted to write for, but for I had a soft corner, but today was just hopeless "Customer Service". I went to the store today (13th May 2014, 5:30 pm) to pick up an online purchase. Waited near the online pick up for 5 minutes and no one came by. I checked with one of the employees who was sorting out the returns in the back and taking them to the shelves, he told me to stand in the 'Q' for returns, I asked him again and he said those guys will help you out. I stood there for 30 minutes and when it was my turn I was told to go back to where it says "Pick up your order here". When I was sad over the wait, Glory,  the Customer Service Manager just told me to go and stand there. No apology..nothing. Glory sorry to say, I oberserved your behaviour many times and you don't deserve to wear the badge "Customer Service Mgr'. Not eve anything close to that. You are a shame.
Melissa bad behavior:
There was a senior citizen, Lady 60 plus may before me in the Q for returns and I think she stood there for 30 minutes or more and when it was her turn to be served, Melissa who was the counter made a hand gesture calling her to the front. Are you serious??? Grow up Melissa. Walmart is cheap for prices not for cheap behaviour. You will be that age one day. Shame on you.
Bottom line, Customer service is just aweful, hopeless and cheap.

Glory, Melissa, Marie, Vicki, Koree grow up. You don't work for Goodwill shop you work for Walmart and we pay money for goods. You don't do stuff for free.< /text>

< review>
I left my credit card in the store last night and have tried multiple times to reach someone at the store and no one is answering the phone. This is incredibly frustrating to be unable to contact ANYONE when I am trying desperately to recover my credit card. All the phone lines, except for the pharmacy, ring and ring and ring and ring and ring. That is EXTREMELY POOR customer service!</review>

Not much different than all of the rest of your Walmart supercenter’s. If I could make one suggestion to Walmart though, I would say that the returns desk should have separate lines. One line for returns and one line for money services. We did have to wait about 30 minutes to be seen.</text>

Horrible Walmart. Parking is very congested, store is unusually messy and difficult to navigate. The layout seems very dysfunctional. Would not recommend.<//Text>

< review>
I don't know who is in charge of ordering merchandise but I have gone into the store four times this week to get five gallon bottles of water to find they have none. Each time I was told they are waiting for a shipment. Really? This isn't the first time I have had this issue. Someone in management needs to get it together.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very itchy people, and that helped us find everything we wanted and we didn't have to stand in line to pay. The people who attend very friendly. I don't rate it excellent because the bathrooms were dirty. As much as the person in charge cleaned them, the people who used them did not try to help keep them clean.

(Original)
Muy pica gente, y eso ayudó a que encontramos todo lo que queríamos y no tuvimos que hacer mucha fila para pagar. La gente que atiende muy amable. No le pongo excelente porque los baños estaban sucios. Por más que los limpiaba la persona encargada, la gente que los utilizaba no intentaba cooperar a que siguieran limpios.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dc75b26992381f:0xee60197de9274d9c</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
