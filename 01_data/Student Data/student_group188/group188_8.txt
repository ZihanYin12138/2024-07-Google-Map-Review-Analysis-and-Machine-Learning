My husband’s vehicle was illegally towed in the apartment complex that we have lived for over 5 years. The reason I was provided was the security said it was a fake a permit and the only way we would be able to take out the vehicle was by paying for it. I did because I planned to take it up with my home association and the security company. Not sure how they towed it. Not the right way for sure because  whole front end towards the bottom is damaged. Like it was bent inwards when being dragged. I proceeded to record my vehicle and the man that towed my vehicle approached and I asked where my “fake permit” was and he said he gave it to the security. Not sure why they unlock my vehicle and give any of my belongings to someone else.< /Text>

<review>Are you kidding me!? During pandemic!? Where people ESPECIALLY WITH EXTENDED FAMILY stay at home and their cars filling up the apartment complex parking! Where are others suppose to park when there are SUPPOSED-TO-BE-CLOSED NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES and vacant spots to park? Should we park it in the middle of the road? Sincr there's no sign at all. Should we? Also, requiring us to pay a regular amount? I paid $315 for a car towed at 2:32am. Is this company bored and just milking money out of people who need their cars for essential jobs and they just take 315 or else not let essential workers like me do my job!?< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
This company is a joke! Went with a friend to pick up his car only to have Julie yell at him because she's been dealing with the car all week! When he asked how much it would cost to get it out, she told him it didn't matter because he wasn't going to have the money go pay for it anyways!! Then she started yelling at him because she thought he was on drugs!! Her exact words, "I used to be a crackhead, I know" and when you ask to speak with a manager, she says there is nobody above her. Oh, on top of that, you have to wear a mask, even though she runs around barking without one<//Review>

<Review>My wife got a notice on her car saying that they were going to tow her car if she left the our car port empty again. The ironic thing is that the car port wasnt empty, I was parked in it. I called to ask what the hell did they threaten us with a tow and write false information and they told me that it was the apartment manager. The apartment manager doesnt leave the the type of notes that was left in the car. They definitely do illegal tows here. Theives!!!</Review>< user_name>

<text>This company takes advantage of people. My niece’s car was towed from a parking spot that was available for parking until a specific time in my apartment complex, yet they took the car 2 hours before the allotted time. The female employee that took my call was rude and unprofessional. It was obvious she knew what to say and had zero customer service etiquette. The worse part is that the manager of my apartment complex has some type of agreement with the company at the cost of us, the tenants. May God bring about his justice in this situation and to the many others so that people will not be victims of similar scams, all in Jesus name, amen.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<username>Gonzalo Reyes<//username><date>1476296748529< /date><rating>5< /rating><Text>No one likes getting towed. No one likes to pay the impound yard. sometimes I ask myself. If people park in a private lot or property  and don't bother to read the signs on the lot then maybe just maybe that's why they got towed. now some people try to get away with things and try to make it hard for the tow guy but if you're in violation you will get towed. It's not hard to look around and if you see a sign make sure you read it. I've heard it all and I've been called every name in the book. But I still have a job to do. If we don't tow you, someone else will. Don't get mad if you get towed from a private property.  Remember it's not your property to do as you please.

Ask someone that has never be towed, how they do it. Why haven't they got towed. It's easy. Read the signs< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Witnessed how this company travels all the way to a different far away city and two different employees were watching from a distance and towed each a car, the lady and her son then, ran fast after their white truck being towed....😓😓😓😓😔😖😤 Then 3 minutes later an employee finishing his shift found out the other car was his...today is Thanksgiving, he had to work today...left his job with a bouquet of flowers, perhaps ready to go to have dinner witj hus family...we told him Santa Ana Club just towed his car. He said, "but I work here" he had just gotten off, it was 6:10pm. I ask the company, Is this the job you want to do? Is this how you want to be remembered? Doing this today on Thanksgiving causes a good conscience?< /Text>< username>

My car was taken at a plaza i work there so according to the policy night parking is allowed. Later they took my car away.and they asked us to pay 360 dollars. We have to pay first and according to their words we can get refund later if we have approval we work there. We submitted the approval the next day in march. But until now. We been back and forth many times. But they refuse to give refund.  They are tricky<//Text>

Towing companies need to follow rules and laws for private property.  They are required to have signed authorization from Property Management or an authorized agent of Property Management.  This has to have correct and legit information on it.  Including contact information- phone #- employee name- title- etc.  If for any reason you are refused this- example- employee does not have access- manager is not here- its after hours- its a holiday.  File a police report under vehicle code: 22658.  The police will then know how to report the violation-  Its an unauthorized predatory tow.  And you will have a record that they refused you this fundamental right.

Towing companies are legally obligated to give you signed authorization and more before you even pay for your car.  Best thing to do is pay- get your car back- file police report- take them to small claims for 4x your  fees.

If your rights have been violated you can report to the better business bureau- to report unethical business practices.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>LETTER TO OWNER / MANAGEMENT:

FIRST OF ALL: I notice you have a piece of artwork depicting Jesus Christ with a crown of thorns around his head - a stark contrast to the attitude displayed by (YOU) the woman working behind the door of the "CLUB" last Sunday February 25th at 1AM - when I picked up my car.

YOU SHOULD REMOVE CHRIST FROM YOUR WALL because your cold, dismissive and merciless attitude is NOTHING LIKE CHRIST. You misrepresent all that Christ was and is by treating people like pieces of garbage. It's one thing to run a business for profit, but it's another thing ENTIRELY to disrespect people with your tone and your attitude.

I won't touch too long on the predatory towing practices that we ALL KNOW DARNED WELL your "CLUB" engages in - that's ultimately between you and Jesus (HANGING ON YOUR WALL.)

But let me remind you, since you have that art of Christ on your wall:

(here is but one verse where mercy is addressed, since you have that piece of art depicting Christ upon your wall, perhaps you are familiar with the other verses...but perhaps (and probably NOT) so let me remind OR VERSE you)

JAMES 2:13

KJ21: For he shall have judgment without mercy, who hath shown no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

-----

Your attitude was mocking, at the very least. An attitude of us versus them, with yourself esteeming yourself as more worthy than others from behind glass. You'll have to decide if the predatory towing your company engages in, along with your contemptible attitude toward other human beings,  is Christ like and decide to take down that piece of art since you're not witnessing His mercy in tone or attitude, and the predatory towing is OBVIOUSLY not merciful.

Now on to my review.

Santa Ana Club engages in predatory towing. They seem to have all their i's dotted and t's crossed. So you'll have a hard time fighting these people in court. But at some point their greed will catch up with them and they'll make a fatal mistake. I hope you (whoever is reading whose car was illegally towed via predatory towing) will be the one to finally bring judgement upon this company.

Do not attempt to defend yourself with claims that people deserve to be towed, as not ALL people who you have towed DESERVE to be towed. My own car was towed literally 1.5 hours after midnight. They didn't waste a hot New York minute in whisking my car away--and I'm pretty sure they were salivating over the profit since it was towed away on a weekend night.

Here' a suggestion for all who read this. If you have the time or inclination, go to where your car was towed, and lay in wait. Watch and see their patterns, take notes, get photos or videos - and watch for the patterns, and you'll witness predatory towing in effect, and perhaps one day be able to finally nab these greedy people in action. It's worth a shot.

So to the owner, be careful where you tread, I might be watching you, we might be watching you. Be really careful, we might catch you and you might find yourself in a court of law. But more to the point, JESUS IS WATCHING US ALL, SO TREAD LIGHTLY.

And PS to "Gonzalo Reyes"

You "ask yourself" if people like getting towed? I suggest you find a more productive thought. You're obviously a shill for this dishonest company. It's OBVIOUS.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) The lady k attended us very kindly if the client arrives with a positive attitude, but I do not understand the following: that same lady shouted at a young boy who explained that the cars were being picked up by the owner of the parking lot (from where the cars were raised) He wanted to eliminate prostitution, vandalism and drug addiction from his business, now someone explain why he lets the boys drive the pickup trucks and start SMOKING MARIJUANA in the parking lot where they keep all the cars they lift .... 😡😠
They should get employees k don't smoke drugs the smell was very obvious and we were the last of the night, there was no way to blame anyone else, they don't even have neighbors that place "santa ana club"

(Original)
La señora k nos atendió muy amable si el cliente llega con actitud positiva, pero no entiendo lo siguiente: esa misma señora le explicó a gritos a un muchacho joven k los carros ellos los recogían xk el dueño del estacionamiento (de donde levantaron los carros) quería eliminar la prostitución, vandalismo y drogadicción de su negocio,  ahora k alguien explique xk deja k los muchachos k manejan las camionetas d remolque se pongan a FUMAR MARIHUANA en el parking donde guardan todos los carros k levantan....😡😠
Deberían de conseguir empleados k no fumen droga el olor era muy obvio y nosotros fuimos los últimos de la noche,  no había como hecharle la culpa a nadie más,  nisiquiera tienen vecinos ese lugar "santa ana club"</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Absolutely loved this place! My family & I are from Yucatan & they most definitely have the authenticity down! They even got imported items straight from Mexico! The gentleman who assisted my parents in our big order was super knowledgeable and an amazing worker! I can not wait until my next visit to California so I can get more bread! PS: they also do shipping but call beforehand as he stated to ensure they have the items and ensure shipping options!</review>

<Text>If you're looking for an authentic Yucatán food experience,  look no further than this bakery. I've been searching for this style of Mexican food since returning from the Yucatán peninsula,  and there's not much in the space out here in LA.

The cochinita with pickled red onions takes me right back to those memories.
The cheese empenadas were am explosion of yumminess
It was concluded with a perfect desert. A baked pastry filled with sweet potato and sprinkled with coconut flakes. Heavenly with a cup of coffee or by itself.
In addition, the warmth and courtesy from the staff makes it even more special.< /Text>< UserId.>

It could've been the alcohol talking from being in the Mission but the baby burrito I got here one late night was awesome. It was just the most perfect little baby burrito I've ever had. Nothing crazy fancy - just some carnitas, rice, beans and mild tomato salsa. That's all you really need. Workers were super friendly and you could tell they were used to the hoards of people standing in line. Burrito was out in a jiffy :)</Text>

I just want to say that I actually hate burritos of all kinds but this place changed my mind. Their garlic mushrooms were the game changer. Their meat was super fresh as I watched their cooks cook each item and put it in the food tray.
This beats chipotle and I LOVE chipotle. Come and check it out. It's super affordable too. Go super or go home!<//Text>

So I am updating my review in all fairness.  When no other option was open that would deliver, I tried PV again.  This time I had a Carnitas Burrito BOWL and it was tasty and good! everything seemed really clean and fresh, even the guacamole was fresh and delish. So I guess their delivery tacos are not the thing for me, but know that I know what to order...I will be back!< /text>

<review>Always a ton of fun heading over to La Flor de Yucatan. I initially got hooked due to their legendary bread pudding. The other postres are good but the bread pudding is an absolute all-star, must-have treat.

I always hear people getting the tamales but I go for the salbutes. Perfectly soft with a little bit of crisp, like a airier scallion pancake. The chicken's a little dry but put some salsa on, you'll live. Glad to see they're busy as always during the pandemic. The staff is incredibly nice as well.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This is a must go place, this place has the best Mexican food from Yucatan. The torta de cochinita is just amazing! The Kibes were awesome as well. Their Chochinita is just the best you must try. The customer service is above and beyond, very friendly people there. Glad to live nearby now!</Text>

Love coming to this place. Literally a hole in the wall place, but meant as a good thing. Authentic Yucatecan food. The pastries are good as well. I get the Panuchos, soo good. Fresh ingredients, and with the habanero sauce they give you, delish. Stop by and give it a try. Staff is really courteous and friendly. They make you feel like family.<//text>

< Review>
Earth-shattering, mind-blowing, game-changing Cochinita Pibil. The Yucatán is a whole different kind of Mexico - and to experience it in Los Angeles, get over to LFDY!!! Their slow cooked meats in doughy corn tortillas (salbutes!), their decadent pastries (stuffed w sweet potato & coconut, guava paste, or the cream cheese&jalapeño puffs), and everyyyything in between. They’ve even got chaya - the Mayan spinach superfood that makes for a great smoothie. I stumbled upon these guys while getting my car worked on down the street at Pep Boys, and then I was back two days later for more. Cochinita Pibil, if you don’t know, is super slow-cooked pork (traditionally cooked underground) that has this rich red sauce w a kick of sweetness- almost like a pho broth that’s been cooked down, maybe bc they both use cinnamon? Whatever, it’s not science— it’s MAGIC. You’ve got to taste it to believe it.< /Review>

Great service and food. Definitely worth the drive. If you're nearby you should check it out. I got 2 pastor tacos & 1 mole taco. Both very delicious. Everything tasted so authentic. I felt like I just got to grandmas house and she cooked me this meal. Staff is very friendly and welcoming.< /text>

La Flor De Yucatan is a authentic as it gets. Family owned for over 40 years. The staff is great and the patrons also. The feeling I got when I was there is one of nostalgia. Everyone there (staff and patrons) made it feel like as though I had just come home from being away. It's so fragrant that you will be lead to the restaurant from at least a block away.< /review>

So parking is terrible, there are a couple of chairs to eat there but the Cochinita Pibil tacos are DELICIOSO so worth the effort. They also have this pie pastry with ham and cheese, try it, forget what it's called but its yummy. Just ask for the big round pie w ham and cheese it feeds about 6 or 7.< /Review>

Enjoyed the view at the intersection of Hoover and 18th of DTLA skyscrapers combined with sound of the sea of traffic whizzing by on Hoover. Food comes out slowly but it is worth the wait. My favorite was the Lechon available on the weekends.<//text>

<review>Usually love going to this place, everything they sell is delicious! but recently bought an ojaldra de jamon y queso and have to say I was very disappointed. It was dripping in grease and was very unpleasant to eat. Unfortunately had to throw it away since no one wanted to eat it.</review></record></dataset><record>

We drive a long way to get our excellent Yucateco food from here, every Christmas for the past few years.  The food is delicious and I wish we lived closer to come here on a more regular basis.  Annie has the most exceptional customer service, always willing to keep the customers happy.  I totally recommend the tamales colados, vaporcitos, cochinita pibil, frijoles negros colados and rice.  The hojaldra is divine.  WE LOVE THIS PLACE!</Review>

< Review>
A trip to a nearby auto upholstery shop left me wandering around Pico-Union for a few hours with a sleepy baby in a stoller.  Was very lucky to find this place.  It's a really nice, completely family run bakery.  I love their baked goods--they even recommended a guava filled pastry that didn't have any dairy for my allergic toddler.  What really shines is their Cochinita Pibil, Lomitas (only on Thurs/Fri) and their tamales.  The cochinita pibil is a pork stew that is great in sandwiches(tortas), on tacos, or do like me--I buy it by the pound and eat it for a week over rice.  They serve it with pickled onions that provides a nice sour counter punch to the stew's umami goodness. Go there more then once and they'll be greeting you by name.  I hope this place continues to do great, and someday graduates to full restaurant.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The food is great, if you have never tried Yucatecan food this is the right place to introduce yourself and try authentic Yucatecan food.
I am a frequent customer of this place and I think it could be perfect if they had such a bad attitude to attend.
I have been deprived of the desire to eat several times due to their terrible attitude

(Original)
La comida es buenísima, si nunca has probado comida yucateca este es el lugar indicado para introducirte y probar auténtica comida yucateca.
Soy cliente frecuente de este lugar y creo que podría ser perfecto sino tuvieran tan mala actitud para atender.

(Translated by Google) What it is The authentic food of Yucatan and its variety of flavors and smells is unique. The attention is cordial and they have Panaderia with the typical flavor of yucatan. It is a small little place. People usually order to take away. There is no parking and the bathroom is small but the food is worth it.

Great tempura batter is just right not too thick not too thin crispy just the right amount. 🍤⛩
No restrooms, table service, or all you can drink. 🚽🛋⛲
Parking is squeezy 🚗
Menu is simple and good 📖
Sushi is yummy for the price. 🍣
Very cute location🐱
Quaint private quiet📴
Good for meeting a friend not good for date night. Also great for groups. 👭👬🏻
Simple honest straightforward🥊
Service was good and authentic🇯🇵

Very tasty and traditional asian food. 5 star restaurant! Friendly stuff, clean interior, low price. I like this place for quiet and not much people in lunch time. They have parking, it's a big plus) Chicken udon is my favorite noodle soup here, simple but really tasty :)<//text>

Superb teishoku and classic meal Japanese restaurant.  Reminiscent of my times in Japan; the they are so friendly, kind, and really care about quality and client satisfaction.  Food is delicious across the entire menu.  I really love the mix fry if you’re looking for a starting point but you can’t go wrong with almost any menu choice.  Can’t recommend enough and quick and easy takeout service during these covid times.  Thank you Tokyo Fast Food!!!<//Review>

<Text>Great sushi at great price.
Sushi is fresh and delicious! Only 3.25 per set of 2. I highly recommend this place if you want to catch something on the go. Of course, you have to figure out how to eat it on the go. Go for it.<//Text>< response>

This is definitely a little hole in the wall that blew my mind and tastebuds! My bf and I were visiting the Venice area for the day and looked up good fast food in the area and found Tokyo Fast Food. The price was GREAT and the amount of food you get was more than I could eat! The woman at the front counter was super sweet and friendly and their prices weren't bumped up because of coronavirus (like every other eatery). This place is definitely a gem. You can't beat the price, especially in this area where food is usually expensive!<//Text>

What a comforting place. This restaurant feels like a nice hug after a long hard day at work. Everything from the friendly Japanese workers who run the shop to the 90s feel of the decor makes me feel right at home. The food is here what I wish I can eat every day at home. Nutritious, quick, and delicious.<//text>

I also got a side of broccoli for $3.50, fairly generous portion of lush greens florets - I think they might have been boiled first then flat top grilled for a crispy crunch. I love that there was a healthy vegetable option as a side. Only qualm was that it was so, so salty. I'd order this again but ask to hold the salt. Recommended for a meatless burger and fun side options!< /text>

For the price of the place it doesn't get much better, and the staff is extremely friendly, including remembering who you are and your order.

Parking isn't the best and space is very limited, but they have a plethora of Japanese comfort food options, and some very un-aurhentic options for those who might not be a fan of the food. Their meals come with rice, veggies, pickles and more on the side so it'd quite filling.</Text>

I love this spot. Every time I go to California I have to go to this, the original Tommy's. the people are friendly, the place is different than any burger joint you will try. Grab lots of napkins, you'll need them! The double chili cheese burger is incredible!< /review>

One of the best if not the greatest location for serving quick food for on the go or for eating in. Their cashier is super sweet and the food is amazing, and for the price I can’t complain a true genuine place to come to if your looking for good food and a relaxing environment. Love Tokyo fast food<//review>

Fantastic food, friendly staff at a great price. We visited once from the UK and had no idea what to expect, indeed having low expectations initially, but were blown away. Will definitely visit again next time we're in Cali.</review>

I had the Tokyo special which consists of chicken teriyaki, tempura, California rolls and your choice of miso soup, ice cream or an egg roll. For $10.40 after tax, it's a LOT of food. Flavorwise, this place is decent, nothing special but definitely filling and good enough to satisfy. I would come back. And try their other dishes too.

Btw, a chicken teriyaki bown is $4.95. That. Is. Cheap!<//review>

<review>FOOD
I had a serious ramen craving tonight. For twice the price and a brutally long commute, I could've gone to Daikokuya over by Downtown LA for the best ramen in LA, but tonight I was feeling something "cheap and decent." And Tokyo Fast Food did just the trick.

I had the Tonkatsu Ramen with extra Chashu (added $0.50, not bad for 2 extra slices). For the price (just a little over $7), it was quite good. The broth wasn't nearly as fatty-satisfying as Daikokuya, but I'd say it's just a hair below Asahi (over on Sawtelle) for less $. I'll take that on most nights.

My friend had the Tokyo Special. He said it was pretty decent too. Again, for the price, pretty darn good and excellent quantity.

I'm bringing my own soup spoon next time, because they only handed me a plastic spoon, haha.

ENVIRONMENT
Parking wasn't too bad, but then again we went at 7:15pm on a Thursday. I'd expect parking to be worse at a more peak time. So watch out for that. I liked the homey/hole-in-the-wall feel.

I'm going back sometime. I like :-)

<gmapID>0x80c34cbef927b88d:0xc5e1ea547cb6f69< /gmapID><text>Wings are baked instead of fried which is a healthier option but they were extremely salty, almost too salty to eat which no longer made them healthy. Ordered a cesar salad.. never had a cesar salad look like this. Not even close to what a cesar salad is. The mozzarella sticks were barely cooked if that. Seemed to be just heated as the breadcrumb coating on the outside was soft and squishy. The fries were not done all the way either. They were also squishy. Also 32 wings, fries, salad and mozzarella sticks were almost $70 and took 1.5hrs to be delivered. Extremely over priced especially for the quality of food. Will not be ordering from here ever again.</text><Date>1505516390155</Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>THEY CHARGED FOR A WATER CUP.
My sick&dying grandfather was craving a pizza, so I took him here with my mom. It was a late and cool night, but the restaurant was extremely hot. We walked in to find the doors wide open with no customers, no fans or A/C on, and little lighting. The cashier was friendly, he was the owner's nephew and he seemed like a nice kid. We ordered a pizza that came out greasier than my brother's face after football practice. The owner brought out our pizza and peeled apart the cheapest paper plates, exactly three for our table and exactly three napkins. The pizza grease bled through the plates and I used all three napkins, having to get up for more. I was too afraid to wash my hands in the restroom because the long hallway had no lights on and the walk was too sketchy. The most disturbing part to me was the fact that we had to pay 50¢ per cup for water, I cannot eat at a restaurant that charges for water, especially to my sickly grandfather. While the owner was nice and the pizza was decent, the owner is too much of a cheapskate to keep this place in business for much longer. I suggest that other people take their business elsewhere.</Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
This place should have stayed Maxwells St Pizza. So my first and last experience here was pretty bad. It was a hot day and probably hotter if not the same temp inside. I ordered a slice and he suggested a special (2 slices and a drink) which i said okay fine. So i get my pizza, which Looked good. I found out its pretty darn similar to a frozen pizza. And was also covered in seasoned salt. Covered. I can only assume this was to make it seem like a pizza they made and wanted to add their "touch", but no. It was disgusting. And also gave me diarrhea. Never again. Good luck if you decide to eat here.</Review>

Excellent pizza and service. The owner is very hands on and he actually shook my hand as he greeted me. He showed me the high quality ingredient that he uses for his pizzas. By far, the best pizza in the Fontana area.< /text>

When you first walk in there is a wall of arcade games that aren’t usually turned on. The pizza is good if the cook remembers to pull it out on time. The prices are expensive and you get charged for every little thing.<//text>

Seriously! It was a old pizza that he tried to warm up. It was horrible. I felt so bad for the guy because no one was in there that I kinda just snuck out after paying.<//Review>< pictures>

Everything is extremely over priced and dirty. The paper plates and plastic cup he gave me had dust on it. All the tables were dirty. Its so hot in there my butt was stuck to the seat while I waited for my food. When I poured my sprite black stuff came out the spout. The soda machine looked dirty. The guy who took our order had sandals on. When I bit into my hot wings they were still bloody. I am pregnante I hope this doesnt hurt my baby. I will take legal action!😠< /text>

It doesn't look like much but its good. Its hard to find a good local pizza place, but its good. My wife and I have gone 3 times in the last 2 weeks. The wings aren't too bad either, they give you extra sauce so you can re-dip. Lol the service is pretty quick as well. Since its local, there's nobody really there. They make their own dough if im not mistaken, so its always fresh. The potato wedges aren't as good. They seem like the ones you find in the frozen food aisle. They're friendly as well. Its worth a shot to try them out.< /Text>

The pizza was cold and had no flavor. The wings were also cold and the potato wedges were still frozen. They took over 1 hour to serve us. This place is nothing like it used to be back when it was Maxwell. Dont waste your time.</text>

<review>i feel so bad to write this because the owner seems like a really nice man ( even though we gave him a $100 bill and tried to give me the wrong change). but the food was hella nasty. the pizza was alright but had no flavor and the tray that it was served on was dirty and the wings are worse i was starting to second guess if they were really chicken i only ate one and dont even get me started on the beer. the owner should invest his money in something else. the food industry is not for him.</review>< pictures>

I love pizza! But this place was horrible!! The pizza tasted like cardboard and very pricey for a one topping large. Only one pepperoni per slice. If you can compare it to anything it looked and tasted like the pizza from a lunchables. Might as well just go across the street to Little Ceasers</Text>

Good pizza, awesome owner and staff, good prices, and good drink prices. Good amount of TVs and lots of seating and arcade games for kids.
Great place!< /Review>

<text>Beer is expensive!  Food is cheap quality, jalapeño poppers had no cheese in most of them, and buffalo wings were broken in half and counted as one.  Their flavor was not good.< /text>< Date>

Husband ordered salad, 8 pc wings, sandwich and a drink, $22. We waited 45 min - 1hr, as my husband went to cancel the order, they said, oh the salad is ready, nothing regarding the sandwich or the wings.  When the salad was ordered, my husband asked for croutons and they said sure, when he got the salad, again asked for croutons and they told him, sorry we dont have any. Other customers arrived after we did, and they got their order before us. Place specializes in pizza, that's all they should have on their menu.  When my husband went to get the refund, he only got $4 back, out of $22 & change. I repeat, worse experience ever.  Not even good for 1 start, but had to choose to post this.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>This place has HORRIBLE service since the ownership change from Maxwells Street Pizza. Sure the pizza is pretty good, but everything around it just sucks. From a look at the prices, the managers have no idea how to run a business. The staff is nice, but the managers are really running that place into the ground.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<review>Someone put a "BS review" about how good this place is and we know it's probably a worker or family. This place is the nastiest place in Fontana. The tables are always dirty and the soda fountain, don't get me started! That nasty black stuff can get you sick. I had pizza there last year and still have the shats! Eat here at your own risk! The owner has to be smoking something cause he thinks he can short change people everytime. Oh and The restroom, omg disgusting! Close up shop and take that filth somewhere else.</review>< Pics>

<text>Im looking at all these reviews and their so stupid litteraly in my honest opinion I think their pizzas amazing! Delicious full of flavor and bud the owner of the store is extremely nice!!! For all of those who don't know him and say mean stuff about him especially that he's on drugs it's a load of crap.-.- theres another worker who works there and she helps clean and everything she's super nice as well. There wings are super delicious!!! Its a wait for them but it's because they make them  fresh and hot, I love this place it's big inside and its a great place to have a childs party.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Normally I dont bash on reviews buuut... The owner is RUDE & seems like he's on drugs. The place is super dirty! We ordered 2 slices to try the pizza before we ordered full ones & Thank God we did! 1st off he tried to over charge us by $2. He said for "debit charge" but we paid cash.  We refused to pay the extra money he got mad & said "im just trying to make money boss". The pizza was DISGUSTING to say the least. It tasted like middle school pizza. After the 1st bite we threw the slices away because we were to scared to eat anymore.  Don't waste your time or money. I dont see how this place even got 5 star reviews. Buds is the scum bag of pizzas!!!!  Should change the name to Duds. Yuck.< /Review>< pics>

So i ordered a large pizza & wings & when i went to pick my order up i had to wait a while, my pizza was ready but i had to wait an extra 10 minutes for the wings. Manager is very rude to those who go & dont buy, a man went inside to ask to use the restroom & was denied very rudely. Another man went to offer cleaning service & reached to shake his hand and the manager said "no no im cooking!" VERY BAD SERVICE DONT GO!</text>

<review>I don’t care much for going to the dentist. Most people don’t. Dr. Falvey and staff make visits to their office very manageable with their professional, competent, and calm behavior and environment. Extra procedures and equipment have been added to ensure patient and staff safety. I have very sensitive teeth and every effort is made to make me feel comfortable and to participate in decisions about the dental work. Thank you Dr. Falvey and staff.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>My Teeth look great! Dr Falvey is possibly the best Dentist you will find in Nevada County! Pain free!  He has a way of explaining in detail through computer images of your teeth how to restore and create a future plan to keep your teeth healthy and functional so you can avoid dentures. In my case I had so many old fillings and other dentists just kept adding to them. My smile has always been my best asset and I knew I wanted to keep that but I hated going to the dentist in the past because it hurt and I always had bad experiences. Dr Falvey made my experience completely pain free and pleasurable. You can tell he is personally interested in the future of your dental needs and he created a personal plan just for me so I can always have my own teeth. Amazing and painless. I recently had an implant for a missing molar because of a previous dentist who botched me. Dr Falvey assured me it would be pain free and it was quick and easy breezy.  Now I look forward to going to the dentist. His staff is the best ever . Helen is the dental tech and she is wonderful and makes your visit even more fun . Don't go anywhere else, this is your guy!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

All’s I can say is that I wished that I had found Dr. Falvey years ago because here is a dentist that is extremely knowledgeable, considerate and caring and has personally helped me with all of my dental issues that I truly thought could not be restored. He takes great care and thought  in restorative approaches and treats my family and I with the upmost respect. All of his staff are top-notch in all ways and I always feel welcomed and supportive in all of my visits! A+</text>

I was very pleased with the additional safety precautions taken in regard to Covid-19.  The staff was as wonderful and helpful as always. They made me feel comfortable and at ease with the new procedures.  They listen and work with your concerns and needs, especially if you are like me and get a bit anxious just going to the dentist.  I feel I always get a complete check of my oral health and hygenine and they explain everything very well.  I am very thankful for Dr. Falvey and everyone in the office.< /text>

< Review>
I was very impressed with the office and staff. It’s incredibly clean and well decorated with top-of-the-line equipment. The staff are super friendly and the doctor in particular was very professional and personable. Best first impression I have ever had at a doctors office and I really am very excited about establishing care here!

*Update: Hands down THE BEST! Really, I could have fallen asleep during a crown prep if it wasn’t for my mouth being open!!! I was a dental assistant many, many years ago, and have had several dentists over the years, and Dr. Falvey and staff are the Best by far!!! Thank you Dr. Falvey!</Review>

Very impressed with all the precautions taken by ALL personnel in the office. The COVID-19 prevention procedures are in-depth and very much appreciated.
Of course, the interactions with Dr Falvey & staff are courteous and professional with just the right amount of conversation & humor.< /Review>

Dr. Falvey and his staff have always been very thorough and conscientious toward my dental health, going well beyond simple cleanings, fillings, etc. They explain things clearly and answer all my questions fully. Something I have not found common with previous dentists is that at the end of a cleaning appointment, Dr. Falvey comes in to briefly examine me, consult with the hygienist or assistant, and comment to me on what he finds. I appreciate that kind of attention!< /review>

He explained everything and took time to listen to my questions.  All my life going to the dentist  was difficult for me but Dr. Falvey treats me like a friend  first then a patient. I was with my last dentist for over 30 years and  finding a great one is important to me. I have had at least  15 crowns, 2 root canals and plenty of fillings  a root extraction prior to seeing Dr. Falvey.  So you see I speak from experience..< /text>

<text>Always a good experience. Friendly staff. Never wait more than a few minutes. Dr. Falvey is a perfectionist-- exactly what you want in a dentist. Friends say they hate to have their teeth cleaned-- I have never had a bad experience at this office and I have been going there for over 10 years.</text>< pics>

<Text>Dr. Falvey and his team are great.  I've been going to them for 20 years, and they have always been up front about cost and care.  They have preformed crowns and one implant, all first rate.

I was pleasantly surprised that the whole process was painless and easy. I felt confident smiling for photos on my wedding day with my new veneers and we have an ongoing treatment plan to restore and preserve my teeth for years to come. His office has the latest technology and he has years of experience. Dr. Falvey and his staff are always friendly and helpful. I would recommend him to anyone I meet.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1562869996601, 'text': 'Jennifer, it was my pleasure to do this for you.

Everything was done so professionally on my last visit as always. I was confident that Dr. Falvey  was going to make it a super clean and comfortable experience. With Covid, I wanted to be sure that they took all the precautions and they did and more!  They have implemented new standards and equipment and procedures that kept us all safer.
The whole experience from the  first warm welcome from Laura to the cleaning from Amy and the exam by Dr. Falvey was excellent! Can't recommend this place enough!</review>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr. Falvey for over ten years. He  is dedicated to providing the best  dental care for his patients. He is highly skilled and professional in his work. At the same time his warm and friendly personality puts the patient at ease. His newly remodeled office features the latest equipment and technology.  Like Dr. Falvey, all of his staff are friendly and professional,  ready to answer any of your questions. Whenever I have had a dental problem, Dr. Falvey takes the time to explain all of my options.  In a nutshell, Dr. Falvey is a great dentist and I could not recommend him more highly.</Review>< pictures>

Dr. Falvey is the best! If you want someone that is honest, caring, and ready/willing to do the right thing for each and every patient, he is your dentist. He is always learning and expanding his knowledge to further his education to assist his patients needs. I highly recommend him hands down.  I do have to add that he has done 3 crowns, and two root canals for me and usually I have major anxiety. With Dr. Falvey that anxiety has faded into a distant past.  Now, I go in with calmness, and ease of mind. He's that good.< /review>

Before I started going to him I had an abscess tooth and was told I needed to go to Roseville since no one local did root canals. The endodonist in Roseville had no openings for a month. I was frustrated not to mention in pain.
Dr. Falvey has done multiple procedures in order to “keep me chewing”! I’ve had numerous dental emergencies, needing care at short notice and was always treated as soon as possible. If someone were to ask me to describe Dr. Falvey’s level of dentistry I would say he is the only dentist I’ve been to (and there have been many in my 66 years) that is progressive and professional. He is always looking for better ways, or new equipment in order to better treat his patients. His patients are important to him. I consider him to be honest and not one to do anything unless it’s necessary. He takes time to explain what I’m dealing with and what my options are to resolve the issue.
His staff has always been kind, caring, and respectful. The office is clean with music to relax by.
Overall, if I could give Dr. Falvey and his staff more then five stars I would since they certainly deserve them.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Name>Judith Horky< /Name><Text>It can be a scary thing when moving to a new location after having the same dentist for 15 years! We hit the jackpot in Grass Valley...Dr. Paul Falvey. My teeth are a major challenge for any dentist...80 years of problems. So it was with some trepidation when I walked into Dr. Paul's waiting room. But there was a soothing, relaxing feeling. And I still had to get on "that" chair. What I've learned over the last year is that he is the best dentist I've ever been to--and believe me, I've been to many! He is gentle, efficient, calming, compassionate, thorough, professional and honest. Actually, so much more. The whole operation is immaculate and welcoming. The equipment is all top of the line and he knows how to use it. The staff are all excellent and friendly and give you the feeling that you're in good hands. I've already had several crowns (much needed) and will have more, plus no qualms when I need more implants or extractions. My husband and I have complete faith and confidence in Dr. Paul and hope you'll give him a try!</Text></record>

<text>He is very knowledgeable and friendly. He has equipment that I didn't even know existed yet, like this x-ray machine. You stand up and it circles around your mouth and takes a full set of x-rays. He is board certified in implant dentistry and some other aspect of dentistry (I forget what). Unlike other dentists I've had, he explains what he is doing (and why) as he works on your teeth. I recommend him highly.<//text><time>1490205954692<//time><response>{'time': 1486313101133, 'text': 'Thanks Don, it had been a pleasure getting to know you and thanks for the meditation tips!

<text>The most important thing to me is that a dentist knows what he is doing - to really be a master of his craft.  I haven't mastered a darn facet in life to match the competency Paul demonstrates with his excellence in total health dental care.  So that's enough of a reason to go to him...but it doesn't stop there.  He has got the "touch."  He does things in my mouth and there is never pain.  Then he or his staff follows up to make sure I am healing properly.  Amazing.  So if anybody who reads this review is persuaded to go to Paul from what I've honestly said, please mention my name...I want the dinner and a show referral promotion from him.</text>< Pics>

<name>Angela Bueno<//name><date>1565924608030<//date><rate>5< /rate><review>I found Dr Falvey by researching dentists in my area and reading reviews. He had amazing reviews.

After extensive research, and learning that he does all his work "in house" even pulling teeth... I realized it was time for a consultation. He seems to do everything at his office, in Grass Valley. That was huge to me.

When I finally got the nerve to "start to fix" my lifetime of completely damaged teeth, I scheduled a consultation with Dr Favley.

I originally went there with all intentions of pulling out all of my teeth and starting from scratch with implants. Thank God Dr Falvey had something way better in mind,  that I actually didn't know was possible from the condition my teeth were in.

After a few consultations and his expertise, Dr Falvey managed to save my teeth and help me understand that if I were to pull all my teeth out (like I first imaged would work) then I would have ABSOLUTELY NO "feeling" with my teeth anymore. That it would feel empty. He cared enough to take me a whole other route. He totally cared about me and my teeth. He could have done implants and charged me a ton  money for them...because they are expensive, but that wasn't his motivation. His motivation was to help me feel happy and smile beautiful without being so extreme when it wasn't necessary.

I am so darn grateful he had these consultations with me. I learned so much on how to brush my teeth and care for them to bring them back to life.

My smile is bridge like veneers. They are so pretty...and the best part is I can feel my teeth still... I can feel when I bite things still... that's amazing

I'm so grateful I took the time to research and find Dr Falvey. He made the impossible happen. I smile so big now. Something I haven't been able to do almost all of my life. I'm so grateful. He will be my dentist for life.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809b703752158c85:0xc23a7654be0aa30</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Thanks to a recommendation from very good friends, we have been patients of Dr. Falvey for over a year.  My husband & I had never had such a complete dental exam as we both received as new patients. We have received crowns and partials. He is extremely meticulous in his work. He also enjoys photography and bicycle riding so we have something to talk about which always makes it more pleasant to see him.
And, as others have written, his staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.<//Review>

<Review>When I moved to Nevada County in 2002 and was searching for a new dentist, Dr. Falvey was suggested by a colleague. I liked him, and the whole set-up, immediately. Sometime after my first appointment, he provided me with a plan for my overall dental care. We reviewed it together as he explained his rationale for recommending one thing or another. He was clear and instructive, and he answered my questions with patience while explaining the proposed treatment in ways that I could understand. Since then, some 17 years later, nothing has altered my first impressions of Dr. Falvey and his staff. If anything, my respect has deepened. His expertise as a dentist, the standard of excellence that he continually strives for, and the consistency of the quality of care that I receive are the reasons why I remain a patient of his long after moving back to the Bay Area. Experience has taught me to trust his judgement in matters related to my oral health.< /Review>< pics>

If a photo is worth a thousand words, what about a video?

Paul has been my dentist for5 years.  He always reminded me to brush, brush, brush.  This last visit he showed me via a new video camera he has how easy brushing is and it does remove the plaque. The video showed me and sold me to brush, brush, brush.

Paul and his staff have excellent dental chair manner. I can recommend Paul to any one.< /Text>

<Text>My almost 80 year old teeth have been looked at, drilled on and, yes, some have been extracted, by many dentists.
I hated to go to a dentist until about 12 years ago when I met Dr. Paul.
Not quiet sure how he was able to instantly remove my fear factor, including the white knuckle grip on the arms of  "The Chair", but his pleasant personality for one and then his expertise in handling most all procedures are, as I know now, the reason.
Dr. Paul is assisted by Laura, holding down the front office and then, chair side, is Helen, completing the obviously proud and efficient team.
So, you chicken(s) out there, should you find yourself in need of minor or major work done on your teeth, go-----run and call Laura to make the appointment to see Dr. Paul.
You will make a new friend!< /Text>< Pictures>

My wife and I have only been living in the Grass Valley/Nevada City area for 18 months. Dr. Falvey was recommended by my wife's sister and we have been extremely pleased. So much so that now our Daughter and Son-in-law are his patients. What better recommendation is there then  if you send your only child to him.< /review>

Dreading my first root canal at age 55 and being told by my local Dentist in Reno that due to the complexity of my particular root canal, I should see a specialist, only added to my anxiety.
Dr. Falvy was recommended to me by a personal friend as a highly skilled dentist who does impeccable work.  I drove 70 miles (one way) to see him and I have to say that I was amazed at how comfortable I was throughout the whole process.  Aside from having to take ibuprofen for a bit of soreness for few days, it was a painless experience.  Thank you Dr. Falvy - I will be back this month for my crown work!</text>

My husband Garth and I have been going to Dr. Falvey since he opened his practice in Grass Valley. Appointments have always begun on time. Discovering something new in equipment and technology during our appointments never comes as a surprise and speaks to us about his commitment to education and keeping staff and practice state of the art. We are of an age that has required some complicated procedures; the incredible digital technology and his patience with us beforehand to show problems in detail and the best way to approach restoration is much appreciated. We also appreciate how the office always looks at how best to use our insurance coverage over time on various procedures. Dr. Falvey and staff are friendly, respectful, attentive and committed to our best care. We highly recommend him.</Text>

<review>Changing dentists is not easy, that's why for more than 15 years I commuted to San Francsico to continue with my dentist, but it became too much for me to commute. My dentist of 35 years in San Francisco referred me to Dr Falvey. I was hesitant, but could no longer commute. I was so pleasantly surprised by Dr Falvey. He is so kind and sympathetic and caring as are his staff. I couldn't be happier…..I hope to be with him for 35 years!< /review>< pics>

The morning after my implant surgery since I had no pain in that area, I started chewing on that side and discovered it felt quite normal. What a surprise!  I believe because Dr. Falvey offers earphones to listen to music from his I Pod, I am totally relaxed and consequently my healing is smoother.  His staff is equally competent and friendly, always making you feel very comfortable.  After trying other dentists in the area, I finally found the one I trust completely.

I'am a patient of Dr. Falvey. Some time ago he said I was wearing my teeth down, with grinding them in my sleep. On a recent exam my teeth were determined to be worse.I got fitted for a night guard and it is perfect. The guard will help with avoidance of costly dental care in the future. Thank you, Dr. Falvey and staff.        B.J. Lawson<//review>

<Text>Simply put the best Dentist I have ever had. I had to find a Dentist who cared and was also highly educated with a good bedside manner. I had to go through 12 Dentists before a friend referred me to Dr Falvey. After extensive pain and suffering for most of my life, Dr Falvey was able to identify and treat things no other Dentist had even noticed. He saved my life, had to have several mouth surgeries and implants installed for dentures. DR Falvey  took the time to extensively work with my surgeon to ensure I had the very best care. I cannot say enough about Dr Falvey and his friendly staff. I highly recommend him to anyone needing adult  dental care or extensive work. Thank you Dr Falvey for giving me my life back, I can eat comfortably now with no pain after over 20 years of suffering.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I found Dr. Falvey through Healthgrades and Google reviews, all rating him with a 5/5. I was not disappointed! He is an extremely thorough, meticulous, experienced and pain free dentist. He spends enough time with his patients in the beginning to determine your overall needs and dental health goals, matches that up with a complete evaluation of near term and long term plans, and comes to an agreement with you on how to proceed. Excellent! I've been waiting all my long life to find a dentist who would actually be willing to give me a long term plan. He is practical and straight forward in his assessment. I have trust already in his judgement.

His staff is likewise very professional, caring, and efficient, each carrying out his plans with strong experience in the field. I highly recommend Dr. Falvey and his team!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1501900835198, 'text': 'Wow, Jacquie that is especially meaningful coming from you as I know you have seen many very reputable dentists in the past.

<Text>Hi my name is Lisa,  I was needing a dentist when I ran across Dr Falvey's name on the internet.  I had not been to a dentist in years, why you ask, don't know the answer, just always felt uncomfortable.  All those years caught up with me and had to have some major work done. So glad that Dr Falvey was the man for the job, he explained every process thoroughly and what to expect while performing the procedures in a compassionate and gentle manner.  He changed my opinion on having that dreaded dental appointment which now I kinda enjoy!  Thank you Dr. Falvey!<//Text>< Resp>

After seeing several other dentists in the area over the years, I can truly say that Dr. Falvy is by far the best, most meticulous, smart, organized and above all super nice, dentist I've ever gone to!  Bravo!  I recommend Dr. Falvy to anyone who cares about their dental wellbeing.<//Review><resp>None</resp>< user>

I'm using my husband's Google account to let everyone know how excellent Dr. Falvey and his staff are.  I have never been to a dentist and dental hygienist who were as thorough in checking for cavities, gum disease, and cancer as they are.  His state-of-the-art equipment and practice is impressive.  Their color computer print-outs of my teeth show problem areas and assist me in brushing and flossing more effectively.  Dr. Falvey keeps a close watch on any developing problems and he and his dental hygienist advise, encourage and coach on the use of brushing and flossing and preventative care with special brushes, toothpicks, etc., that he supplies free of charge.  Dr. Falvey, his hygienists and his receptionist are friendly, helpful and caring and make a visit to the dentist something I look forward to.  (Kelly Cherry)</Review>

< Review>
Superb is the one word my wife and I use to describe Dr. Falvey’s practice.  We have collectively been treated by six dentists in the past spanning forty years and different locations in California and they all have been very good to excellent.  Dr. Falvey’s excellence however is far above.  His approach can be summarized as:  Dr. Falvey exercises the least amount necessary that insures the most beneficial treatment and result for his patients.  He strives to address and offer the most viable options for a patient’s oral health which in turn enhances overall health while simultaneously respecting and working within the patients expectations.  Dr. Falvey and his staff offer excellent advise on home dental care that includes both how to care for your teeth and the specific type and style of tools for your particular hygiene needs (toothbrush, interdental brush, etc.).  The entire staff is truly professional, very pleasant, and enjoyable.  It doesn't get any better!</Review>

Dr. Falvey is in the process of replacing my lower teeth with a permanent denture.  The replacement process has taken almost a year and is not yet complete.  I have called Dr. Falvey many times during this process, often after hours, and he is always patient and resolves the problem immediately.  He has state of the art equipment and his staff is friendly and compassionate.

Since I have had problems with my teeth since childhood,  I don't look forward to going to the dentist, but at Dr. Falvey's office it's almost pleasure

Before becoming a patient of Dr. Falvey, I had already been treated by a periodontist.
Even with better brushing and flossing, I still had issues.  Thanks to Dr. Falvey,  I learned  how to maximize the care of my teeth and gums.  As a result, with just a simple daily regime, my teeth and gums are now healthier than they were 20 years ago.
I really appreciate the way Dr. Falvey keeps up with the latest techniques and dental education. Most important to me is how he has taught me to become proactive for my
own dental health.</Review>

I first want to thank Dr. Falvey for all the time and attention he spends at each visit. He and the staff are very professional, caring and are a great team.  I have had routine exams to crowns and I have been very impressed with the thoughtful ideas and suggestions to make each visit a comfortable and painless process. I was surprised to have photographs taken of my teeth, but so glad it was done.  During the consultation, Dr. Falvey was able to review the pictures with me so I could see the areas of concern and we worked out a plan together. I am involved with my treatment and the decisions that are made. I would highly recommend Dr. Falvey and his staff for your dental needs. While you are there, check out the amazing photographs throughout the office, Dr. Falvey took those.< /text>

Dr. Falvey is a great dentist. He has filled my teeth 3 times and they all have been smooth and perfect. They did not hurt while they were being done, the shot did not bother me, and it has always been a good experience with Dr. Falvey. Additionally Dr. Falvey went to great lengths to counsel me on my nutritional choices and how to better brush my teeth so I don't get cavities in the first place. I highly recommend Dr. Falvey.< /text>

His office staff; chair side assistant and dental hygienists are all caring professionals who make you feel at ease and comfortable in their office.
The care includes overall instruction in proper dental care and maintenance as well as procedures such as root canal and implants; all with excellent results. Dr. Paul always takes the time to ensure we know and understand the problem he sees and explains the various options of care.

Owner told me he had what I'm looking for in the other store (30 miles no freeway), so I drove there the next day. He didn't have what I was looking for and he tried to convince me that a different product would work. Frusterating.<//Text>

Their stock was completely empty after Christmas for their mods, BUT the guys were super informative and willing to answer any questions I had. (Had a tons seeing as that I'm new to vaping) We recommend them! The other place in clearlake, the one lady seriously told me to Google my questions.</review>

One of the best places around lake county to get all of your smoking needs. I went to a different smoke shop and the prices were really high so I came to smokers hardware and the prices there were really good and the people there are very helpful I will not go to any other smoke shop except this one< /Text>

{'time': 1543802738265, 'text': 'I apologize for your inconvenience, but when you deal with vendors and wholesalers, their inventory frequently changes and although they say they are shipping the coils we need, they often don’t show up or they go on back order. That leaves us to deal with unhappy customers at times, although we always try to please everyone. I’m curious how many times you’d leave a bad review for corporate places like Walmart and Kmart when the don’t have what you want. You seem so open to bash this family owned business that feeds my family as well as other families around Lake County. If it really bothered you that much, you could have contacted me, personally, to fix it immediately.'}< /resp>

Initially I first visited this store looking for a glass slider. They don't have much selection for that. So I then looked at their Dab Rigs-OMG!! LOL I walked around to see all the rest of the store...I do have to say their pipes are spot on for quality and price!! Picked me up a beauty of a winner💚👍 They have some cool stuff, the service is usually very hospitable..some growing needs are there..def give this store a try! These are just MY personal accounts with this store. But I still go often to buy incense, stickers, check out new pipes & other groovy products! They're located perfectly, easily sighted from the intersection even. Kind, open people service.</review>

<Text>SA recycling: Workers are polite, organized and actually quite diligent about following guidelines. And I really appreciate how they conduct business. However, they are quite slow. Wow, they are slow. There were about ten people ahead of us with I'd say eight of them only recycling cans (including myself) and it still took fifty minutes to get out of there.  Hence, the three stars.</Text><user_name>Worldofthunder<//user_name></record>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Do not go here. Terrible price on copper, I didn't notice it until i got into my car and checked the receipt. My friend with me recycled some copper last Saturday at a spot in Santee that had copper #1 at around $1.90 a lb, these guys had it at around $1.25. I went back out to those guys who "work" there and they said they don't price match. Will never go there again. I wanted to put my plumbing license on file and wouldn't accept a picture of my license, said they had to send in the real thing to corporate to put me on file. Once I go get the cash Monday I'll never go back. The people working there are next to worthless as well. Go to Troy recycling in lemon Grove for good customer service. The guy tried to mix up my #1 and #2 and count it all as #2, when we asked what he was doing he had us sort it all out while he talked with his buddy. I truly feel ripped off. When we did the math on the price drop it was around $80+ we lost going here.<//text>< response>

Absolutely by far the worst SA. Incompetent workers in yard and scale. I have been to SA all over 5states. This one absolutely awful. Fernado is a snake. Deliberately rip people off. Dont waste time. They need to fire everyone but office girls.<//review>

Great place to recycle your auto through California State program aka BAR (Bureau of Auto Repair). This is the only accepted one in S.D. that will take your car and give your refund from the program. The staff were friendly and helpful through the process. Lots of parking on site. They also recycle almost all metals and other items. Easy to find and located right across the street from 32nd Street, US Navy Base and Churche's Chicken. Handicapped parking and rest area available.<//text>

<review>Rude employees at the car recycling center. Whenever you ask them a question they tel you oh you can take your car to LA, since they know they are the only one in san diego.
I was in line for over an hour and everybody that came in after was helped before.
I spoke to the manager and she did apologize about her useless employees, a very nice lady they need more like her.< /review>< pics>

This is probably one of the most completely stocked packing, shipping and moving supply stores I've been to.  They pretty much have everything!  I think their prices are reasonable and the staff is helpful.  Access to the store and parking is excellent also...

Super convenient.. parking in back or on the street. Great local establishment with good prices and great selections on all things shipping related. Labels, tapes, packing peanuts, and boxes boxes and boxes of every possible size (it seems).

I just needed a couple of small bags of packing peanuts and made mental note of all the stuff they have. Pretty impressive.</text>

I've been going here for years. Great prices and inventory. It feels a little claustrophobic because the room is small and they have loads of stuff, but that's why it's great. Best box store in LA.</Text>

I have a Content Management Company and with all the rain came all the flooded homes and business.  I was running low on inventory and in a rush to get to a job.  I needed 100 boxes various sizes along with the necessary packing supplies, i.e. bubble wrap, tape, paper, popcorn and I normally just go to "the Home" place.  It was so out of my way and as I on my way and dreading the long lines and the search mission necessary to find what I want;   I saw Box City's bright yellow sign and decided to go in.  WOW! There was every size, style and shape you could imagine of boxes and every other item I needed to stock up for this job.  No lines, inventory was beautifully in order, personable and efficient staff and best of all they had lower prices!...a better name for this place would be Box Heaven and it's my new choice for boxes and packing accessories.

Thanks to all at Box City on Victory!

PS.  They also have other convenient locations..LOOK THEM UP!<//Text>

I have been going to Aloha Foot & Ankle Associates for a few years. I have had nothing but great service from the staff. Being a diabetic, I need to keep an eye on my feet. That said, I got an infection last year. After I got out of the hospital Dr. Han Nguyen took great care of my foot! She is polite, explains everything so I can understand it. My foot has healed up great.
Thanks to Dr Han Nguyen and her Staff<//review>

Dr. Nguyen is a very professional, well accredited and caring Dr..  I had serious infection on my foot, I called the office on Monday at 11:30 and they got me in at 1:30 for a consult.  Well Monday afternoon I was admitted into the same day and had surgery today. Bottom line she did an excellent job</review>

My experience with Aloha Foot & Ankle Associates is always great. They are my go to for ankle and foot issues! The office staff is always friendly and super helpful. My doctor, Dr Chan, always takes the time to listen to my concerns and is helpful in providing information on what the next steps are. Always answers my questions with patience and understanding.<//text>

The doctor is very kind and thorough.  She initially went through each symptom that I was having, then presented 2 possible causes based on an obviously deep evidenced based medical knowledge.  Finally, she presented recommendations on how to resolve the issues and written instructions.

I was very impressed with the staff and doctor.<//text>

<text>I came in to get an ingrown toenail fixed. It arrived too early to my appointment and they took me in right away regardless. The front staff was so sweet and helpful. After meeting with the doctor we decided which procedure was needed. Dr Meyers explained everything very clearly and eased my anxiety. The procedure was very fast! The hardest part was getting numbed but Dr Meyers talked me through everything to distract me which I very much appreciated. Overall, I had an excellent experience and would definitely return here if I needed to in the future.</text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I highly recommend anyone in search of podiatric care to seek the aid of Aloha Ankle Associates. The entire staff, from the front desk, to the doctors are not only incredibly friendly and helpful, but really intelligent, experts in their fields. I may have only seen Dr. Nguyen, but I have no doubt in my mind that if she is an example of the expectation being set at Aloha, there will never be a displeased patient!

Made a appointment with Aloha Foot & Ankle for a ingrown toenail.  The office called me and got me in the office first thing Monday for a procedure.  The office personnel were kind and professional.  Doctor Nan Nguyen was very thorough with her exam and care.  I am schedule for a followup in a week for further evaluation and treatment.  I am very satisfied with the team of professionals at Aloha Foot & Ankle Podiatrist.<//text>

I was desperate because I goofed when trying to clip my own toenails, had them bleeding and was concerned.  I was just looking online to find a foot doctor and found Ahloa Foot and Ankle.  I was concerned being a senior and when I called they were able to squeeze me in after work!  Could not have been more pleased with Dr. Chan’s expertise, surgical procedure and complete knowledge and follow up!  Her office staff was beyond friendly, considerate and knowledgeable!  After my procedure, when I had any concerns, they had a number to text questions and pictures and offer immediate reply to ease your concerns.  I would highly recommend this Doctor and her staff to any and all of my friends and family!  It’s a small office with a big heart and consideration for you problems and concerns.  I have found that many practices have gotten so big that they you are just a number in their daily routine and rush you through like you’re on a conveyor belt!  If you have any kind of feet or ankle problems...try Ahloa Foot snd Ankle...you won’t be sorry you did! 🤩🥰😍<//Review>

The staff gets me in right at the appointment time and Dr. Chan doesn't make me wait. When she comes into the room she has read my file and she is familiar with my case. She listens to what I am saying and she makes sure she understands what the problem is before coming up with a solution. More Dr.s need to take this approach....</Text>

<review>Reviews help out alot, that's how I chose Aloha foot and Ankle. Dr chan and her staff have been extremely helpful and very caring. They listen to your complaints and address them with accuracy. Im so grateful for finding this place, I drive almost 1hr just to get here so that should say it all! Definitely worth the trip.  Thank you Dr Chan and staff for being so helpful.</review>< Pictures>

The Doctor was very comforting to me while cutting out an ingrown toe nail and did a great job fixing my toe. Fast, professional and I would highly recommend her as your podiatrist.< /Text>

Had a really bad ingrown toenail removed by Dr Myers and couldn't be more pleased with experience. For someone that doesn't like needles they made the entire procedure nearly painless! The staff we're very friendly and professional. Would highly recommend for any foot or ankle issues.</Review>

<Text>I recently saw Dr. Chan here and I was impressed. She’s very educated and knows her profession well. She’s also very pleasant and I didn’t have to wait more than 5 minutes to see her. The office staff were great too. Highly recommended.< /Text>< Pictures>

The staff and Dr. Cachia are amazing and his level of experience only adds to the pleasure of always coming back. He was referenced to me by another amazing doctor who could not perform a necessary procedure gone wrong by a doctor years back. The care and service I receive each time has helped in a positive healing of my foot and amazingly my self confidence.< /Text>< Rate>

<review>This was one of the MUSTIEST hotels I have ever stayed at! The staff weren't that bad, but the cleanness was awful! It smelled DISGUSTING, the pillows and sheets smelled so nasty I can't even explain. There were security guards following us around which was really weird and I didn't feel safe at all.They were kicking people out for who knows what. As soon as I woke up their were these people who had to fix the air conditioning which was super unnecessary. And the people who were in the halls fixing an air conditioner said that their was roaches in the room across form me so I freaked out, then I look at the room across from me and it was FILLED with roaches! It literally smelled like there was a DEAD body in there! Their were roaches crawling all over the walls!! I had to switch hotels because of how NASTY this place was. I 100% do NOT recommend, I have never felt so unsafe in a hotel.< /review><userid>109120199625566717142</userid></record>

<Review>this review happened after the lagniappe i received from Fahmida today.
i was up late as i am working on a new business and Extended Stay America has been my interim home after a conscious separation with my former Queen of 4 years. this place allowed me to heal and the entire staff made me feel welcomed. Tigran has done a splendid labor on turning this place around from what it used to be just a couple of years ago.
Sayyoora was always attentive and sharp on answering all the questions i had during my stay.
Raju is a true gentleman. always dressed his best and with a smile in his eyes while the all maintained the highest standards of cleanliness as we overcome the pandemic and unite again as a loving and kind society. even Trevor caught me a few times and politely reminded me to wear my face mask while in the property. Ricky & Roy was so efficient and enthusiastic with every request i had. i truly wish i remembered everyone’s name, even the security staff present made me feel safe and protected while i call this small piece of heaven on Earth, home. i am proud to say i rose from an extended stay, to my permanent home thanks to the people that made me feel like family during a difficult time. life comes at you fast. i was treated better than i deserved even when at times the stress of life overpowered the balance of Faith. i hope your stay is as renewing and life evolving as it was for me. invest your time wisely and be kind. tell Tigran you read my review, the guy from instagram [@VINALEX] with the loving black labrador (Yes, they welcome our life companions [pets]. service animals are free!) named Onyx & my name is Edvin Alexander and this review was inspired by Fahmida’s passion for delivering a great experience and assisting me with all the items i needed at the perfect time. i share this with you all from my heart with honesty and truth guiding my words. #Blessed🐝< /Review>< pics>

Absolutely terrible customer service! Rude and disrespectful workers! We went down to the desk multiple times to get more towels and blankets and they consistently said they did not have any! Some of the other customers said they found drug syringes and needles along with roaches in their rooms. We ended up moving to a different hotel because of how rude they were!<//Text>

<text>Positive: Location Negative: The room needs upgrade bad. Door has different touch up paint, you are not cleaning every day fine but provide cleaning stuff. The carpet need to go.

Zero stars was not an option....This was the NASTIEST hotel I have ever visited and that is unacceptable...Corporate should permanently shut this location down especially because of the covid pandemic house keeping needs to be retrained on covid cleaning measures first off clean towels are not openly available the front desk advised us to check back tomorrow which is a huge disappointment the sheets appeared to be clean so I took a nap being an essential worker I was exhausted I was woken by a pinch on my thigh I slowly placed my hand where the pain was only to find some type of tick or bed bug so I immediately pulled the sheets off only to find that I had been laying on a mattress cover that was covered in some type of fluids that left stains all over disgusting  yuck 🤮 I will be also reaching out to the health department this is not acceptable by any means<//Text>

<Text>This is the only place that I ever felt unsafe even if they have security people roaming the building and you knew that this is not a safe place. There was a security girl walking outside my door when me n my son got out to buy at the grocery store. And when we came back, my card wouldn’t work so I had to go down and reactivate it. She may have check the inside of the room who knows? Anyways this security girl was there and she told me she would walk me to my door. Lol! Really?! That unsafe! And when I got back my card and headed for the elevator I heard the receptionist and the security girl both laughing. They were so rude!!! I wouldn’t go back and will take my business somewhere else!!!< /Text><Time>1617321600000< /Time><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>None< /UserId.>< user_name>

The man who checked us in (with the smiley mask) did everything he could to be accommodating and welcoming. The room was a different story. The PTAC (heating/cooling unit) was really noisy. The room was not as clean as it should have been, with splatters of something weird on the closet curtain and then some. The street noise outside our room was incessant. If everything about the room would have been as kind as the staff, they'd have a great hotel. But unfortunately I can't recommend the place overall.< /review>< Time>

<text>When I first gotten there I was told there wasn’t a room for me even though I had a reservation the day before and changed it to that day; which was very upsetting.  The front desk associate by the name of Trevor was very concerned and assured me I would have a room as soon as possible.  Even though I was upset I knew it wasn’t his fault but he was very kind and courteous.  He displayed an unique way of customer service which isn’t around nowadays.  Within 45 minutes I had a room waiting for me and he called just like he said he would.  When I arrived there the check in was very fast and he provided me with eating utensils knowing I was there for a while.  He also provided me with food places that was quite delicious knowing I’m not from there.  I almost went to another hotel but this man made me so comfortable I decided to stay.<//text>< UserId.>

Didn’t have the room we booked available and told us we could get a rollaway bed ( which was not true )The over night hotel check in employee compensated us perfectly The morning hotel employee was amazing and got us in the correct room the following day The following morning when asked if we could check out late. Was told 11:30 check out and $10 an hour after that When we had to leave for an emergency at 4pm The afternoon hotel employee told us that there is no $10 an hour late checkout and we’re being Charged the full amount of a nights stay after being told to me in front of her earlier it was $10 an hour after checkout I clearly asked if I was going to get charged the whole nights stay if we leave at 4pm and she answer was NO!The afternoon employee was rude and extremely confrontational with us and disregarded the information she told us earlier and basically said you either stay or leave because you’re get charged either way Except for the afternoon rude employee The other late night and morning employee’s were very accommodating, respectful and took care of any issues we had</Text>

Staying for my second month .  Rooms are great like small studio apartments. Security is very good. The front desk staff is beyond amazing! Jennifer and Tigean are the best managers I’ve ever met. I’ll be staying here another 60-90 days. I highly recommend. Make sure to tell Jennifer “Mike sent me😀”< /Text>

Stayed here for four nights. Located right on Ventura Blvd. Lots of parking available. Hallways were dirty and smelled so bad. Room was clean but bed was very uncomfortable. Had to wipe all kitchen counters because they were sticky. Requested a late checkout but fat man in front desk denied me since he said people are waiting for my room. DO NOT STAY HERE!</Review>

<Review>I’ve had the pleasure of staying at this hotel several times while in the Los Angeles area. Was a bit worried about cleanliness and traveling during coronavirus. Upon arrival I was at ease at the immaculate room.

Great customer service. Every time I have stayed here the front desk woman Fahmida has made me feel welcomed. I was surprised she even remembered me wearing my coronavirus mask last time and greeted me by name. She is very patient as I can ask a lot of questions about my stay and the room. She anticipates what I need and asks first.
She makes sure I have everything to make my stay comfortable(shampoo, kitchenware). Feel taken care of by Fahmida.

Only one complaint was the new policy of $5 parking per day. If you are staying a long stay that can be $150 a month :( to keep a car in the parking lot which adds up. So if you are bringing a car take that into consideration. In the past when I have stayed in Extended Stay parking was included.

The staff and the room exceeded my expectations. Would definitely choose this hotel when I’m in LA again :)<//Review><user_id>110330055485226111261</user_id>< Name>

Positive: Location.  Good location. Negative: Corridors smell like smoke even though there's a no smoking policy.  Outdoor/exterior lighting is poor, suggest provide more lighting.  Housekeeping lacking, corridors are dirty, a lot of room trash left in the hallways/corridors.<//text>

Positive: Price/location-near the hospital I work at.    Add-not enough characters space:  I asked for a blowdryer and they told me I had to come pick it up.  My hair was wet and I just came out of the shower, when I went there, 2 workers, they could've delivered i Negative: NOT SAFE-    When I was driving in, there were alot of security guards around.  It was strange to see so many.  I realized that this hotel is a section 8 hotel and has many drug dealers everywhere.  I did not feel SAFE here at all. I will NOT come back.< /Text>

This hotel is really great, and i always find good deals online; sometimes for under $100! They are pet friendly, the rooms are a nice layout and good size, and awesome AC!! All the staff that i have encountered has been very polite and want to helpful and seem like they really want to make things easier for me. I have stayed about 6 days this month and Sayaya at the front desk in the daytime is really sweet and professional. I wish i could afford to stay here more, they really mKe you feel welcome. Thank you, everyone at Woodland Hills Extended Stay!

<text>I made my reservation on line and even called to make sure that just a picture of my ID would be fine considering mine was stolen and due to the Carona virus I haven't been able to replace it. They said everything was fine so I booked the hotel. When I get there they wouldn't allow me to check in without my physical ID and wouldn't refund me my $ either. I don't understand how people can rest their head at night knowing they just took every penny from a homeless person and left me on the street!?!? Thank u for robbing me extended stay. I now realize how u r such a large company it's because u steal from homeless people!<//text>< Resp>

Negative: I needed an early check-in around 12:30pm instead of 3pm, but there was no way to request this on the website when I was booking the room, and I took the chance that I'd be able to check in early, which wasn't the case. I had to cancel anyhow.< /text>

Positive: The location was ideal for taking care of a patient just out of surgery, Negative: Inability to access the building except the 1 front door. This made it difficult when taking the dogs out to do tiger morning walk,,, anot having other doors open would greatly reduce the funnel like system unto the hotel...

You will not find a better deal in Los Angeles for short term or Temporary housing solutions.  The rooms are fantastic and have everything you would ever need, including a large fridge, nice looking and comfortable furniture, plenty of space for hanging clothes, drawers, large and practical desk, tub and shower and most importantly a staff that is extremely helpful, kind and courteous.  There is someone available 24/7 to at least listen and coordinate any and all concerns that you may have.  In its entirety, you will not find anything in the City of Los Angeles comparable to this location.

I do not write reviews upon request and rarely have the time to do something like this but I have been so pleased with my arrangement that I have ended up staying for 6 months and have no immediate plans of making a change in the near future.  Thank you once again team Extended Stay - Woodland Hills, CA!  Definitely 5 Stars in my opinion.<//text>

The staff was mediocre at best. They do the bare minimal and don't have a 'customer first' spirit. From the outside, it appears legit. However, the type of guests that stay here and around the area appear highly suspect. I will not be supporting this establishment ever again.</Text>

The spacious room...The kitchen was a plus. The tall security guard was doing a great job. What I didn't like: The lobby smelled of weed each day...The fridge made large noises all night...but other than that, I'd recommend this place to friends and family.< /Text>

I was at the end of my wits, everything seemed to go wrong and I was alone with my pup in my car, no place to stay.  I booked Extended Stay, Stay America not realizing I booked everything wrong.

What could have been a disaster was all wiped away.  I had met Fahmida in past visits but it truly wasn’t until last night when I experienced the true talent of her hospitality, warmth and ability to make the clientele feel important and appreciated.  She was quick to point out policy and things I did wrong and explained it and corrected it for future visits.

She was genuine, kind, and is a real gem.  To me she was an angel sent from above who was there to take care of my needs and to let me know things would be okay.  She is amazing and deserves recognition.  Thank you for having her on your team.< /text>

Have stayed at this hotel for months and have spent thousands of dollars with this hotel..am an extended perks member... have checked in early have checked in late i am usually taken care of with no problems with never a complaint against me or issue. However that all changed as the front desk employee Ricky or Ricardo wouldn't even check if they had a room for me after booking another reservation he was very rude in saying I couldn't check in until an hour and a half after I arrived when I have paid the early check in fee previously and stated I had no problem with paying it this morning. He told me there was nothing he can do when he didn't even check the available rooms. After stating I just drove over 4 hours and just wanted a shower and some rest he was not of assistance at all and in fact had an attitude with me. Very unprofessional. Lost my business for sure.<//text>

Wasn't doing anything wrong and was stared at by some fat man who worked there who then assumed a bunch of ridiculous things and was arguing with me for no reason. He should mind his damn business and learn how to respect guests couldn't believe how ridiculous he was and that they haven't fired him</Review>

I was at the tail end of a terrible day with finding a place to stay.  I was flustered, stressed, panicked as I also had a puppy with me and nothing seemed to come together.  I made a reservation at Woodland Hills Stay America.

Just as I began to realize how I had made mistake after mistake with my booking, with what could have been bad, became a prayer from above.  Fahmida was at the front desk, I had seen her a few times before.  She was kind, friendly, detailed but wonderful in how she seemed to make all the issues, non existent.

She is such a huge asset to this company, a hidden gem that deserves recognition for her excellent customer service and the ability for the patrons to feel at ease.  Had it not been for her, I can’t imagine I would have stayed.  Thank You !!!</Review>

Cleanliness of the room was good, and the Concierge was quite accommodating, especially for a late-night, last-minute booking! Have to give 4 stars instead of 5 though, because even though we booked the room online for one price, once we got there, we ended up spending about $50 more once we arrived and they added in all the "extra fees" and parking charges. Would've been nice to know how much we were going to actually be spending, beforehand. Also, there is no ice machine available on-site, and the complimentary "breakfast" is merely, coffee, orange juice, and single-packet granola bars. They should offer more, or just dial down that bit of the advertisement. I would definitely stay there again, though, if in the area.</review>< userid>

Room decor and design was better than expected. Comforters/pillows could have been updated and thicker, but otherwise the room was great.
Mr White at the front desk really upped the ante with service. Always in a good mood, he helped make the check in process effortless and answered all my various questions about my stay, as well as make thoughtful and helpful suggestions. Thank you !!!
The morning staff were on point as well. Some policies, like maid service applying to rooms booking a week or more exclusively , should be updated. Laid back, comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. Great location as well.<//Text>

<text>Rooms are big, decent kitchen setup, but lacking certain things from typical hotel experience. No coffee gear, no cups, not a spoon. They are pet friendly. This location had an add on parking fee, and the total ended up higher than the verbal quote over the phone. The first location I wanted was unavailable after 10 minutes wait, so I had to drive farther. The website had a database error when I tried to RSVP online. The king size bed was not great but better than sleeping in the van. Bathroom has no fan or vent. Door didn't seal that well, letting in hallway noises. TV system a bit ganky, switches back to advertising channel after not very long, maybe an hour and a half. Had to aim the remote up high. Don't know if I'll return, unless I needed large storage space and packed all kitchen gear.</text><gmapID>0x80c29949ee5ec9c3:0x4777bc5421f86520<//gmapID>< date>

Location is great. There was no breakfast items out, no coffee, no food. Even if there were items for consumption available there isn’t any place to sit. The empty coffee machine is on a credenza right by the main door at the hotel entrance.  Desk clerk said he was about to make coffee. Room smelled too strong of deodorant. Definitely covering something past customers have complained about. So strong you can practically taste it. Bathtub faucet leaks real bad. You can hear the steady dripping all night.  Room has kitchenette but does not have any kitchen utensils or place settings. No ice machine on campus. Has a couple ice trays in the freezer for you to make ice. Inconvenient when you check in late and don’t have a few hours to wait on ice. Drawer in dresser slides out on its own every time you close it. Woke up in the morning nearly walked into drawer. One small, slow elevator for all rooms on 2nd and 3rd floor to share. No stair access from outside to upper floors. I’m left with the impression that the owners don’t know what hospitality means. Inexpensive place to stay but not worth the cheaper price.</Review>

Positive: It was close to my destination Negative: The room wasnâ€™t cleaned properly, there was trash on the floor and inappropriate drawings on the mirror. The front desk employee was nice but the people I spoke with previously on the phone were condescending. Multiple guests do not wear masks.< /Text>

< review>
I have stayed in hotels for over 2 years & NEVER left a review, but I sincerely think that this one is absolutely necessary because of one of the front desk staff, Mr. Wayne. Every time I walk in the door, he always greets me genuinely, making me feel welcomed and like I’m at home. When it comes to customer service, he has gone ABOVE & BEYOND for me when I was having an issue. When other staff would ignore my problem, every time I passed, he would ask if it got taken care of yet, and even went as far asking the “higher ups” several times, even in front of me. I truly couldn’t say enough good things about him, and I would give him even more than 5 stars!! Every single other employee here should take some notes and follow his lead, especially since he doesn’t just make sure all guests are taken care of, he takes care of things maintenance should be doing too. The outside trash cans will be full, people will have left their trash in the staircase for days and it will smell terrible, and Mr. Wayne will take care of all of it on his shift. I’ve even seen him outside sweeping the parking lot when I’m sure that’s not in his job description. All of these are just a small glimpse at some of the things that make him, in my opinion, THE BEST EMPLOYEE HERE! You want to know the best part about it all, he has been here the least amount of time compared to the other front desk associates, and he is more professional, more hospitable, more sincere, and more willing to help with whatever you need.

Lastly, Mr. Wayne is truly, definitely an all star employee, and I believe he deserves all the praise & a promotion since he’s always going the extra mile for not just me, but ALL THE GUESTS!!!!</review>

Mr. Wayne is the most pleasant individual I’ve engaged with in a long time.  Every person that I witnessed checking in or out is giving him tons of compliments, although he may be exhausted he keeps a smile on his face and keeps the guests smiling as well. My family and I are here as we are in between places so it’s been very stressful for us, so thank you Mr. Wayne for being such a kind person and putting a smile on my face.  It’s greatly appreciated!!!< /review>

With limited hotel availability in Los Angeles on Tuesday night 05 November 2019 I took a room at the Extended Stay in Woodland Hills. The accommodation were standard, but my encounter with night clerk Mr. Wayne left a positive impact on me, because if his dedicated effort to provide the best guest service and customer care to me as well as the 3 other guest who were in line prior to my arrival. Extended Stay is fortunate to have good people like him on their team, which helped my 11 hour stay pleasant. Thank you Mr. Wayne and thank you Extended Stay. :)<//Review>

Positive: Front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  Security guard was very professional.  Parking was convenient. While I was not traveling with my pets, pets are allowed which I always appreciate. Negative: Seemed to be a residential hotel for many people.  No real amenities.  Window in room didn't lock properly, and outside the room was where "residents" congregated to smoke.  Hallways were very dark.  No kitchen equipment in room.</text>

<Review>Horrible.
One star rating is too high of a recommendation, but it is the least I can rate.
Gabriel and Alysia were nicer. Staff is courteous. Hotel is shameful.
My dog picked up fleas. I had to buy flea shampoo from pet store. My dog threw up both days.
Management solution to problem less than impressive!
Also, there is a $25 pet charge per day. Not worth it.
On site management did  nothing to solve issue, perhaps corporate will.< /Review>< pics>

Booked one night here, none of the amenities offered online were provided. People in room 125 were smoking weed in the room which was also filling the hallway as well. People begging for money and cigarettes in the parking lot yet this hotel charges you 10.00 to park there a night. We had planned on extending our stay but decided to leave and go to another hotel which was cheaper and had hot breakfast not a muffin. Then this morning we see this place on the news for 3 people getting possible Fentanyl exposure. These people only care about collecting your money, no care for actual safety. Guess they only care about collecting the 250.00 fee for the people smoking in the room not the exposure to drugs throughout the hotel. Won't ever stay here again.</review>

< review>
Mr Wayne (and not Bruce) was super friendly and helpful. He seems genuinely invested in his job and the perception the guests have of the hotel. With that in mind I'm going to be honest. The staff is awesome. The room was good although we were in the center of the hall and bringing luggage in through only the front door was a huge pain and inconvienance. All doors should have in and out accessibility. And some place outside to sit and smoke would be great. Also there needs to be bags for people with pets to pick up their waste, not just signs saying to do so. You also need stoppers for the sinks to do dishes. I love that their is 24/7 security for the property. Overall I had a great stay. There just needs some upgrading done. Just because this is in Woodland Hills doesn't mean it shouldn't be as good as the San Diego location. I had to wait until rooms were cleaned to get a toaster and dish drainer. There should be enough supplies for each room. And upon check in our room didn't have a clock in the room. Mr. Wayne had to find one for me. And the prices of the vending items were way higher than the San Diego location. $3.00 for a soda was a joke. And switch up the grab and go breakfast offerings, for all locations. Overall I still give this an5 of 5 rating mainly because of the staff.< /review>

<Review>I enjoy my stay there, Our Room was very clean and nice. Front office did call us to ask if we we're enjoying our stay. Which is awesome because i got the disability access room due to having surgery.

Only negative is that when i asked where was the breakfast. A lady whom was working the front desk pointed to where the breakfast was and made a comment saying " Sorry this isnt IHOP" which i found to be rude. Because it was my 1st time staying there to be told that.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The service was impeccable and the front desk guy with the glasses was very kind.. and they have a dude there with an incredible beard lol. But in all honesty, I was truly please with the staff and Mr. Wayne was probably one of the nicest hosts I’ve ever experienced. I’ll definitely be coming back here when I’m in Woodland Hills again.

<Review>I think yelp should allow users to give negative stars. This hotel deserves -100 points. I never seen such a horrible dirty lobby in any other place still the rates are comparable to the better renowned hotels. The lobby smells so bad. If lobby itself is like this you can think about the room. The staffs are so disrespectful and super rude. people who work there don't know the meaning of customer service but work in a hospitality industry.
One staff checked in my bags but minutes later other staff shouting at us to remove those bags and told they can't store even for an hour. The tone was rude and ultimately I cancelled my reservation and found a nice hotel nearby with better price and welcoming hospitality. Stay Away From This Place.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Very bad experience with ESA. They overbooked my room and I didn’t receive a room with two beds. Unfortunately I needed to be in this neighborhood and other hotels were full I had no option but staying at this hotel. Hotel is not clean at all. Rooms smell like ashtray and hotel claims it is smoke free. Staff are useless. I ended up sleeping on the floor and this hotel didn’t have extra blankets. I will not come back to this hotel and don’t recommend anyone to do so.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><userid>116004985313913710487<//userid><Text>UPDATE ~ OCTOBER 2020: STILL  5 STAR !

Great place to stay !!! Wonderful staff !!!  Very comfortable, accommodating, and safe studio apartment with parking!!!

Every precaution was taken to keep me safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit us all hard right after I began my stay in March 2020.

I’m only leaving now, at the end of October,because I was offered a one bedroom apartment I could not refuse.

I’ll miss my friends at ESA - they really cared about my well being from day one thru my 8 month stay (!!!).

Stay safe and healthy y’all and thanx 🥰

***********************************************************************
FIRST POST: 5 STARS !!!

Given that I am under this horrific quarantine, I must say that staying at this Extended Stay is the BEST possible place I could have chosen to move into!  Great staff, lovely room with a beautiful tv, microwave, coffee pot, towels, toilet paper which can’t find at any store!!!

I have now been at the Woodland Hills ESA for almost three full months, I repeat that choosing this location was a perfect decision.  I feel extremely safe and cared for !  Everyone working here, from our GM, Tigran, to everyone manning the front desk to the worker bees who work so hard keeping our rooms clean and supplied with whatever we need (toilet paper !!! ), to the security staff and other maintenance personnel, I could not be happier.  They all deserve an A+  !!!

I also appreciate that I am not being charged a daily parking fee !  I was not happy that I was charged $ 300 for the first two months, and I was delighted to see that the $5/nite fee was no longer being charged when I paid for my third month.  During these trying times, any financial help we can get is very appreciated.  I am still waiting for my CA Unemployment to kick in, and I've been waiting for over two months.  Balancing my budget is still of dire concern, but I am hoping my situation will improve soon.  Staying at this Extended Stay is still doable for me, and I am grateful for that !

Thanx for caring,

Sharon Simon

< review>
I don’t know why people pan this place.
It’s a stop and go kinda place. Anyway I have to say Mr Wayne is freakin AWESOME! He is so calm and patient ...there was a Persian lady who couldn’t understand English and she was being so rude to him and he kindly was being overtly nice ...which ultimately made her look so stupid!
Also the property had to turn people away as they were oversold but Mr Wayne got me my room and told me to wait so that he can do my paperwork. He is the third employee at the extended stay properties that has been excellent ...so I really don’t get the negative reviews.
Anyways Mr Wayne is amazing and deserves some kinda recognition from the Extended stay corporation. Stay here to experience his amazing hospitality 👍</review>

Front desk staff during the night was extremely rude. I was not given any pots and pans to cook for all 3 days and the whole point of booking an extended stay room was the facility of getting a kitchenette. Room heater was not working for 2 out of 3 days. It was only replaced in the last day of the stay and they never tried to give us a different room. Never addressed our concerns nor gave an attempt to resolve them. Will never stay in Extended stay America again. Worst experience ever!</Review>

Our room smelled so strongly of scented spray or cleaning products that it literally gave my husband and I a headache. The drawers of the dresser would not stay closed and kept opening by themselves all night. Not really a bothersome to me but my 9 yr old daughter was convinced there was a ghost in the room and wouldn’t sleep all night. Woke up to a leak in the kitchen under both the sink and refrigerator that was flooding the floor. We were checking out anyways, so we just mentioned it to the front desk on our way out. Overall, we did not get a great vibe from this hotel and wish we would have stayed elsewhere. Especially for the $$ spent.</Review>

The rooms are excellent but it's disappointing management does not tell in the advert that you have to pay extra for parking fee $10 and that breakfast was not breakfast but a machine in the lobby with a muffin rapped in plastic. If they would have disclosed it I would be better prepared to make an informed decision and given them a higher rating for sure.</text>

I came at a very bad time for the ESA. Due to issues outside of their control they were having massive delays checking in people and I made a choice to stay elsewhere for a night rather than wait which caused my previous reservation to be cancelled.

That all said, when I returned the next day Mr. Wayne, the one man army, helped me get everything sorted out despite numerous issues on my end. He was both helpful and professional and it felt like he cared about my wellbeing as a person rather than a body that filled a room.

It wasn't my most pleasant hotel stay, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that the issues were a one time thing due to extranious circumstances.</Review>

It smells like weed and the breakfast sucks the whole overall experience sucks. I had to wait like 10 min till my check out because the big dude in the front was not there. He was out in the back flirting with the housekeeping and when I left my keys in the room they asked for no id or anything so the security of that place needs to improve. DONT STAY HERE !!<//Review>

Bunny friendly hotel! We were at a last resort calling hotels in the area to find ANY that accepted pet owners since we had just checked out of the worst hotel experience at Motel 6 a few blocks away. To our astonishment a guy answered my call and said: well bunnies are small creatures so we’d count your two bunnies as one pet fee, $25. No exhorbitant pricing like other hotels, (some are $150 per night, plus cleaning fee, pricing us out at the start which is kind of a switch and bait for the pet friendly icon) upfront kind assistance unlike other places.
We checked in and it was extremely busy - people checking in were kinda tired and crotchety in the queue. But the staff (clearly overloaded) were completely unphased warm and welcoming. I was shocked because my prior experience around the corner at motel 6 made us feel entirely unwelcome by the managing staff of their local competitor.
One guy stood out and really took the lead in helping us out. Mr. Bruce Wayne, personally checked on some difficulties I was having with working out the TV. He explained it was an unusual night as people were checking in from surrounding brush fire. Inspite of all this commotion all the staff were highly welcoming, and made me feel like my last months hotel hopping should have gone this way!
In addition... I was completely surprised how well the rooms were fitted out with amenities for a price on par with motel 6. There was a kitchen! Perfect for pet owners, and the furniture was nice. Well appointed rooms and large refrigerator for the bunnies veggies. From now on I will always check out extended stay and recommend it to visiting relatives :)<//text>

Graveyard crew needs work. Tried to check in at 1 am security guard informed me that front desk was taking inventory of towels and won't be back until 130 am. Mind you, I was with my toddler and infant. I've never heard of operational duties take precedence over customer service. What makes it worse, the front desk clerk came out the elevator and asked if I was waiting for her I said yes. She then turned to the security guard asked him if he told me about inventory and proceeded to her destination to bypass me.

Room was not clean or kept like i expected for a 3 star hotel. I would say you get what you pay for, but I've stayed at places where I've paid the same that was much cleaner and nicer.

Daytime front desk shift was great, professional, articulate and very polite.

My stay at ESA has been a pleasant experience. The entire staff from mngr Tiegan down to maintenance Pedro (Liz, Trevor, Wayne, Raju, Roy, housekeeping) are all very affable. Any concerns are addressed immediately. I can’t say enough about the attention and dedication they give the guest. While here I’ve experienced several mngrs and staff changes. Since Tiegan arrived everything has improved from staff to services. You can tell he’s an experienced and knowledgeable mngr. ESA is lucky to have him. Keep up the good work.<//Review>

<Review>Worse hotel we have ever  Booked. We have been here since 12:55 p.m. and still waiting on someone to check us in. We have called multiple numbers and haven't been able to get ahold of anyone. We contented the  Reservations number and they were no help at all.  I never like to do reviews however I'm very disappointed please be careful when booking here.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Ugh.  So I walked in and saw a line formed at about 8:30 at night, which generally isn't a good sign.  After having to watch the poor clerk get berated by someone for having to pay a deposit on her pets, I was eventually given my room and charged up-front (which is odd, because every hotel I've ever been to has charged me at check-out.)  After my experience, I see why they bill people up front.

The lobby?  Dirty, with empty boxes stacked in plain view of the guest services desk.  The elevator?  Also dirty, with someone's graffiti tag still chilling on the door.  I went to my room and everything was greasy - It was the first time I had to use a washcloth to open the door or even hold the remote control.  I don't think I got bedbugs or anything (which is good) but for the price, the rooms should've been in FAR better condition than what they were.

I would only recommend this place to people who need to bring their furry companions with them (as they are a pet-friendly hotel) but I also highly recommend bringing your own cleaning supplies (and perhaps a supplemental door lock) if you're going to be staying here.  Don't expect any extra amenities.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Name>Michael LaRue< /Name>< Time>

Orbitz shouldn’t have this place on their site.  This place is not even good for animal shelter. Very very dirty . The receptionist was very rude and ignorant.we couldn’t stay even one hour in this room , went to receptionist to get our money back , the receptionist was very rude and wouldn’t even talk to us. Had to call orbitz to talk to them. We’re still waiting for our refund.</Text>

Ayana has been more than helpful during my stay, I have been here for a while and since she has taken over she had made sure that I got my medication from the mail and she always greets me by name. She really knows how to do her job in a respectful manner whether she's helping or telling someone she needs to get payment from them.< /text>

This Extended Stay America is a two stars hotel, which means its installations are not all that luxurious and does not have some of the amenities you could find at some three or four star hotels, but the goal of this chain is to offer you a very comfortable long stay, for this, the roms are equipped with awesome beds, good internet connectivity, fully equipped kitchen  and large modern TV.< /Review>

More improvements can be applied to the overall maintenance & cleaning the hallways floors, elevator interiors, ground floors, fresh air by opening the windows in the hallways, & staff management/ training.<//review>< user_name>

This has got to be the worst hotel i have stayed at!!! with the type of service they are offering, this hotel is worth $50/night...
The rooms are not cleaned!
The Fridge is rusty and leaks!
You have to go down to get Utensils (this is an extended stay)...
You need to take down your towels to exchange!
Their idea of free breakfast is coffee, some granola bars and a small selection of packaged muffins...

unbelievable!!!
welcome to the 3rd world hotel in Woodland Hills where the average house cost close to a Million dollars....

unbelievable!!!<//Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>NOT a pet friendly place, despite thier claims that they are- a lonely Cat approached me in the early evening, meowing, Obviously it was dinnertime, so I inquired at front desk, to who's  kitty got out, and clerk told me, yes, It's a guests cat, but this is the second ( and last time) time it has been outside, unattended, and she will contact ANIMAL CONTROL TO REMOVE IT FROM THE PREMISES!!! WHAT? REALLY? SERIOUSLY? NOT PET FRIENDLY, SO BEWARE! ( I begged the young female clerk NOT to do so, as she knows it's a pet of a guest here, but she said she can't have a cat wandering on the premises). Oh, and Maid on 3 Rd floor uses only Windex to clean rooms, - WHAT- No antibacterial cleaner? Oh, and FACT- one must provide a credit card for " incidentals" not to exceed $100 dollars. That's if one smokes in the room or similar  damage, I was told. ( Smoke free hotel) NO debit cards, no exceptions, period. My suggestion? Comfort Inn, located next door.<//Text>< Pictures>

The rooms and location are ok but the service is terrible. No housekeeping at all. I don't know if that's because it's an extended stay. Security is crazy strict. Need parking passes. I'm scared my car is going to get towed if my family come to visit. The whole reason for my trip. You need a room key to get into vending. No ice machines. The little kitchen area is nice though.< /text>

Full size refrigerator, small stove top, microwave oven, full-size sink and plenty of cupboard space. The TV has a limited number of cable TV channels and poor picture quality, definitely not HD (high definition). Bathroom is  extremely clean, roomy and all toiletries provided by management. Staff is extremely friendly, courteous and helpful with everything that I've had any problems with. I would definitely recommend staying here for short or long term. Weekly and monthly rates are very reasonable.  👍< /Review>< pics>

<review>Great location; right on Ventura Blvd near the heart of Woodland Hills, within walking distance to CVS, several restaurants - including a nice sushi place, a few fun bars & pubs, and several grocery chains - like Trader Joe's & Sprouts. The hotel staff are polite & efficient, the rooms are clean, & overall the hotel is quiet & private. This is a great stop if you're looking for a place to stay on a budget.< /review>< Pics>

Great front desk help. Second visit to the area and our second stay at this property. The only thing that was different is that you must enter through the front door now as the other entrances dont accept key cards for entry. It made it difficult when carrying groceries etc.</Review>

<text>I stayed Extended Stay America on woodland, CA. It was clean. Staff were friendly. I didn't like the breakfast, but there was a stove and a big refrigerator in the room so you can make your own breakfast. The location was safe and nice, and took 20 mins driving to Beverly Hills. It's a bit hard to get a double room. Overall with this price I'm satisfied<//text>< rate>

It's more like a 2 star hotel than a 2.5 star if you ask me. The staff was nice though and the room was pretty clean. I would stay again if it was the only one in the price range. Overall, probably worth the price just think it shouldn't fit in a 2.5 star category.</Text></record>

Mr. Wayne and Mr. Tigram

There was
1. A complicated room order taking place at the front desk of a man and a family he was getting the room for
2. A woman calling in fearful about someone attempting to come in her room (room service and she didn't respond when they knocked).
3. Another person calling saying they paid their misc. Charges  (data base showed they didnt) .

And then me, just wanting a room for one night .

Alllll of that going on, and these two men stayed calm and friendly , helpful and informative.
They both deserve a raise with their ability to multitask! 👏🏽👏🏽

The only reason I don't leave 5 stars is the hallway on floor two had a very strong smell or trash or rotten food.
It was not in the room however< /Text>

I chose this hotel because of the low price but I realized I should spend more on hotels and check the ratings on the location so I don’t have an awful memory of a vacation. You have a single person doing 40 jobs in the hotel. The owner really does not care about the well being of the workers.</Text>< Rate>

This place is a HORRIBLE DUMP!!!
Don’t give these people a penny!!!
Never have toilet paper, they don’t wash the towels or linens properly or with hot water! Roll away beds are a joke!
They don’t have any place for dogs to use the bathroom or a place to sit outside of your room! It’s  basically prison because they don’t want you outside of your room or talking to other guests. I have so many more horrific stories to tell, so take my advice DONT COME HERE!!!< /review>

<Text>I've decided to stay here after comparing other hotels in LA, and I'm glad I drove a little further and stayed here. Stayed over the weekend from Friday to Sunday. Room rate was pretty reasonable and room was pretty clean. Surprisingly the room had a kitchen as well. Also, breakfast is included if anyone is interested.</Text><username>Hyesu Cho</username></record></dataset><record>

This hotel was ok, not great but not terrible. The room was nice, it was functional. Not fancy, but a good value. There is a weird smell in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The hallway outside our room smelled like someone had been chain-smoking Marlboro Reds in it for 15 years, despite it being a non-smoking floor.</text>

I had the misfortune of staying at this hotel for two weeks on business.  I've stayed at four different Extended Stay Americas in LA County, and this is the worst one.

The first thing I noticed upon entering the lobby was the smell of tobacco mixed with a myriad of other unpleasant odors.  This scent permeates the entire building.  The hallways are now lined with air fresheners which serve to mask the stench.  Luckily, I travel with a small air purifier, so at least my room was all right after a day or so.

The hallways are dimly lit.  The hotel is in an L shape, and the length of the long hallway gave me some "Shining" vibes.  It's difficult to navigate a luggage trolley into and out of the hotel's single elevator, and guests frequently try to enter the elevator without checking to make sure nobody's getting out first.

On my first night, I asked for a kitchen set and was given roughly half of what the entire set included.  They told me to check back later if I still needed anything more.  The next day I wrote a list of what was missing and brought it to the front desk.  I still didn't receive everything that was missing.  I asked the man at the front desk for two spoons, and he asked me to wait while he got the two spoons he knew were available.  He went one direction, came back with a plastic spoon, then pointed another direction, saying he remembered the other being over there.  He went that way and returned with the second plastic spoon.  So, the hotel had two spoons available, they were both plastic, they were from different sets, and I had both of them.  I gave up on the rest of the kitchen set after that.

At least I didn't find anything awful with my room, which is why I give this hotel two stars.  Also, individual employees were nice and tried to be helpful, despite what they had to work with.  But I can't give more than two stars given the conditions.

During my entire stay, there were shady people loitering about in the parking lot and the side of the building.  I didn't feel particularly safe, and I thought it was odd, since the surrounding area doesn't seem to be so bad.  People frequently parked their cars across spaces in the parking lot.  On my last day here, they did start towing cars away, so it seems they're trying to crack down on that.

Just before I left, they hired a security guard to check people who were entering the hotel lobby and to discourage people from loitering.  My impression when I left was that management is making an effort to turn things around.< /text>

This place sucks. Made a reservation for New Year’s Eve. I get there and they didn’t have any rooms available, apparently all house keepers called in sick and they were to damn lazy to call customers with reservations to let them know rooms weren’t ready. Totally ruined my plans. Front desk was so rude and careless about the situation. If you can stay somewhere else do so. I called guest relations and all they were able to do was to cancel my reservation smh, but my credit was charged anyways. Horrible experience<//Text>

<text>I did advanced booking 2 weeks prior to my stay. Traveling from far, hoping I’d have my rooms i had booked and paid in full for when i got to the hotel buut they didn’t have the rooms I had already paid for in FULL. They gave me options but it wasn’t what I wanted, scattered single bed rooms when traveling with family not ideal. Front desk was was ubderstanding, but they should still have rooms. I even called saying I was checking in late left a note when doing my reservation. Processed a refund through front desk and some on the phone. Had to go to another hotel wasted about an hour. Don’t think I’ll ever stay at this hotel/company ever again. Also says it’s non smoking but there was people walking in with cigarettes..<//text>< userid>

It was a fair deal. Rooms are in decent shape. But they don't have coffee, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, or nothing of that sort. All you get it a bed, a TV, and some towels if that's ok with you.
Also, breakfast is on a 2'X5' table. So don't expect a lot.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Says Complementary coffee but it is always empty. They offer free room cleaning once a week but they won't do it even after 10 days. They will attend to service after 5 to 10 reminders. Oh boy by the way you have to be out of room while they clean, so we may be on street sometimes.<//Review>

This place is horrible. The rooms not bad, but the customer service is trash. If I could leave zero stars I would. They said we have to buy our own toilet paper and would not give us any after one nights stay.  There's no breakfast they rarely fill the coffee containers. They are just rude af. I've never had a place tell me to get my own toilet paper. Wth? Worse than a cheap motel. Don't stay here.<//Text>

Rooms are definitely not spotless. House keeping is nonexistent unless you pay extra. Cigarette burns on the sink of my non-smoking room.
AC is loud. Walls are thin.
Grab and go 'breakfast' is coffee, granola bars, or oatmeal. You'll get a prepackaged muffin if you're down there early enough and get lucky.
Internet is barely 1Mbps unless you pay extra.
I didn't see any of the 'illicit activities' other people claimed to see.

All in all, it's a bed, fridge, microwave and shower for a cheap rate. Don't expect any more and your won't be disappointed.

Update: Hot water was off and on for two days and went 12 hours without any hot water. They couldn't figure out how to process a  credit.  A frequent traveler staying down stairs said he's never seen it this bad, but he's not going to give them another chance.< /text>

Don’t give these people a penny!!!
Never have toilet paper, they don’t wash the towels or linens properly or with hot water!
They don’t have any place for dogs to use the bathroom or a place to sit outside of your room! It’s  basically prison because they don’t want you outside of your room or talking to other guests. I have so many more horrific stories to tell, so take my advice DONT COME HERE!!!</text>< Pics>

<Review>My company put me up in this room for 6 weeks. I had to switch rooms multiple times because of lights not working, sinks not draining properly, car alarms going off in the wee hours of the morning and the high school drum band waking me up at 7am every morning. Do not plan to get a good night sleep here. Also during the multiple times that I had to switch rooms due to them not being adequate I accidentally left behind items that weren't turned in my the maids. I lost a charger, pillow and clothes that I was told were thrown away without the courtesy of a phone call. Do not expect to have a comfortable or convenient stay here.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
When we arrived there was no toilet paper and only one pillow.I called and asked for some toilet paper and was told they would bring it right to us. We waited and finally had to go up to the desk to get it.I also asked for a pillow since we only had one and was told they didnt have any more pillows. As we were putting our belongings away we found dirty laundry that had been left by prior occupants. It was several items, pants, underwear blouse etc. Not something that could be missed. We informed the desk clerk about this in person and she said she would remove it immediately. We then went out to dinner and when we returned 2 hrs. later the dirty clothing was still there. We called the desk about that and there was now a different desk clerk on duty. He immediately came an got the dirty clothes. He also brought us a pillow and said he had no idea why we were told they didnt have any more pillows as they had plenty. He apologized and was sincerely sorry.< /review>

I came here on a business trip (all paid for). Everything was great until we were getting ready to leave. We asked for a later check out and she gave us ugly looks (like how can we afford it). Larger dark hair lady at the front desk was extremely rude and unprofessional. It's one thing to have a nasty attitude but to bathmouth  and talk crap PAYING CUSTOMERS in front of us to some solicitor is crossing the line. What a terrible first experience at extended stay. Can't believe what I heard come out of her mouth. Not to mention her super low cut shirt! Never again.<//Text>

For $100 Extended Stay in Woodland Hills offers a large modern room with a gas range refrigerator and wooden cupboards. There's a table in caster wheels that can be rolled closer to the bed if there were a couple wanting to dine together as there's only one office chair (also on wheels which can be adjusted up or down. There is however a lazy boy easy chair. Bed was clean and comfortable pillows fresh came with 3 on the queen size. Large smart TV full shower and bath tubs. Rooms along verdugo noisy when cars drive by. Breakfast.< /Text>

While it is situated in a very high-end neighborhood, and convenient to many local amenities, with the exception of a single member, the staff here are HORRENDOUS.  They are rude, the are lazy, and they are beyond greedy.  It may be a symptom of the working under an owner with the same foul ways, but whatever the reason, the poor attitude, lack of attention to customers, and overall nastiness of the staff in this place are more than enough reasons to drive by and head down the street to the Holiday Inn or Homewood Suites.  AVOID THIS PLACE.  It's overpriced, and staffed with some of the nastiest people I have ever come into contact with.<//text>

No coin changer in laundry room, no quarters at front desk. Really? The rooms are beginning to look a tiny little bit dated. However, the hotel is quiet, and very dog friendly, and clean. Staff is helpful and there is free coffee, tea and breakfast bars and pre-packaged muffins in the morning.<//review>

Terrible stay. First of all, it said non-smoking, which isn’t enforced. There were so many guests smoking weed throughout our time there. So much so, that in the middle of the night, the smoke alarms went off and we were up for several hours because of it. Also, there was no breakfast, as stated. They give you one granola bar and call it “breakfast on the go”. Waste of money. Leaving exhausted and hungry. 🙄<//Review>

This place is more like a motel 6. It is clean enough but definitely not worth the money when there is homewood suites in the area that is SO MUCH nicer than this place and same price. If one is desperate and everything else is sold out then this would be your choice.< /Text>

It was the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel.  Not clean.  Had to go get fresh towels myself.   Breakfast was horrible.   Muffins and granola bars.   Just coffee.   No tea or juice  or  bagels,  etc.< /text>

" Racist Hotel manager " ......Worst extended stay experience I have ever had , the manager at this location appears to have a problem with black people.  We got  into the hotel at about 9:30 pm.   Check - In was smooth but when we got to our room it had the most foul smell ,  and the bathroom floor was very nasty , it was very late and the other hotels in the area was full for the night , so we decided to get some fabreeze to make it manageable, upon return to the room , there was a pit- bull walking around the second floor,  luckily  it did not attack us.  But at this point we decided that even sleeping in our car would be a better option then to stay at this hotel. So we checked out and was told to contact the Carol the location manager the next morning for our refund ,  and thats what we did the following morning just to be told by Carol that you people always use hotel rooms and leave.   ???   I was shocked by her response so I asked her what she meant by you people , and she said look in the mirror. Carol the location manager refused to refund us our money for all three nights that we had initially  booked.   I will never use extended stay America again because of this.. they will take your money and treat you like a second class citizen if your black.<//review>

On a 4 night stay at Extended Stay in Woodland Hills, CA, in Ventura ave for work, my room was not cleaned. I called front desk and i was asked $10 more per day per celaning. My room had only two towels. If i wanted cleaned towels they want the soiled towels brought downstair to exchange them for clean ones. Te whole building smells like cigars. The elevator and lobby smels like cannabis. Horrible place. Do not nook here.</Review>

Upon check in was told they were over booked and asked what time I made my reservation. More importantly why did they take my money if they didn't have a room available?? So after some time of me telling the person I had booked it. Earlier and asking why it would allow. Over booking. He finally said don't worry I'll give ya a room. My second question would be okay if they are over. Booked then why jot accept people first come first server why have to debate about it. Was placed in a handicap room which wasn't too bad because the. Restroom was bigger than normal. Breakfast was a joke and when I did laundry my things were removed and moved to another washing machine. Over all not a great stay but a necessary evil< /Text>

<Review>The worst ever! Rude and so unprofessional. They should NOT be offering Motel style and charging  for Hotel style. As a Travel agent, I will NOT EVER sell this hotel or any of the Extended Stay properties due to their lack of integrity and respect for their customers and people in general.  They have the tendency to charge clients their CC and when they arrived they are send off, no hotel for them, but they still charged them for the hotel night. Unreal! I will report them to the BBB . And not only that, but this particular motel smelled, dirty and prostitution going on outside. Very bad!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Me and my husband have stayed at this location often. Each time Ashley and Iyana is super nice, very helpful, they go above and beyond excellent customer service. I am happy to see them when we check in cause I know we will be treated well. Last time we stayed was on January 14, 2019 and the evening lady ( I don't know her name) was very helpful as well because our remote didn't work the toilet seat was broken and the two burners for the stove didn't work she was very empathetic to our needs.

Today we checked in again and the gentleman at the fromt desk told us we can't check in early and he could not tell us if we could get a 1st floor room  Iyana over heard him she said they are regulars, she went to check to see if the room was ready and it was....not only  did we get a 1st floor room it was right next to the room we loved and we checked in early...Now that is customer service. If it wasn't for Iana we would of had to wait 2 hours before check in.</review>

We went down to the desk right away and complained about the smell. The man behind the desk was polite and gave us a different room and there was no smoke smell.  We did, however, need to go down to the desk again because we did not have a T V remote or a hair dryer.  Continental breakfast was disappointing.  A piece of fruit would have been nice.< /Review>

Booked queen for 2 nights (4/4 -4/5). Checked-in on 4/4 and that day/night it was good. Left for office the other day and when i came back i found someone else was in the room. Checked at the front desk and to my surprise they gave it to someone else..

All my personal belongings were there in the room and the room was booked on my name for 2 Nights (paid in full while checkin)

Front Desk -
I UNDERSTAND BUT I AM SORRY WE ARE FULLY BOOKED FOR TONIGHT AND CANNOT ARRANGE ANYTHING ELSE.

Why didn't u call before giving to anyone else ( My personal belongings were there in the room and was booked on my name)

Front Desk -
AS PER POLICY WE DON'T CALL OUR CUSTOMERS.

Somehow managed to get half of my personal stuff but it was a very awful experience. This is something which i have never expected.< /review>

There were no additional pillows in the entire hotel (or so we were told). During check-in, I had to wait 10 minutes for assistance even though I could hear staff laughing in the back room.<//Review>< Pictures>

1st Pet friendly 😘. Wow I was amazed how big is like an apartment, kitchen, stove, fridge (full size),microwave,  unfortunately the hotel washer broke so they were using the laundry facility on site for the hotel towels and sheets it took hours be for I could do a small load. Also free breakfast but didn't get that far yet, so far it's cool</Text>

Place is clean and hassle free. They have an on-site laundry room so you can do your laundry there and not have to go to a laundry mat. Dennys and Ralphs are next door and its close to the freeway. All day coffee and if u need something like a toothbrush or hair dryer you can get it at the front desk.</review>

<userid>105764387442958942895</userid><text>I stayed at this hotel in June for one week. It was the worst experience that I've ever had at a hotel.
I complained to the management regarding this smell and the loitering and the people out drinking outside. Also the throw up that was outside for more than 2 days not being clean. On top of it they have random people just loitering around the area.

To their manager Chris . Which took 2 to 3 weeks after me leaving the hotel for them to contact me.  It took me hours of talking on the phone to finally get my refund.

Then I got a phone call from the manager Chris which now I feel like I was conned. He called and apologized and said the hotel is getting a new look to it and would like To give you a complementary room , our best room and hospitality.

To make up for what happened .. He said he would show me that there changing things around..

This is the only reason I came back to this hotel..  On top of this I find out that this hotel welcomes section 8 people. That is written nowhere on the site nowhere in any of their paperwork or anywhere at all. Because if i new this  .. I would have never booked a room here at all.

But the worst of all is they will not give me a do not disturb sign.  I literally had to write on a piece of paper do not disturb and put it on  The door..Then after the 2nd day when I came back a few things were missing from my room..

1st it was one of my beach towels , I have no idea how the housekeeper would think its the hotels. So I went downstairs to the front desk let them know. It was like nobody even cared.

Their policy here is to clean the rooms one day a week. But for some reason that week my room got cleaned 3 days in a row..

After that I was told by the front desk to double check if anything is missing. I looked threw my belongings .. And be hold someone open my check book and took a check.

Right away I reported it to the front desk and they said a manager would get bsck to me.. Manager never got back to me until the day before I was supposed to leave.

I will never stay at this hotel again, None of my clients that I bring from out of town will ever stay here again.

Mind you i bring around 8 to 9 clients per month, to this hotel.  Because the kitchen,  but thats over now after how ive been treated and feel discriminated against..

They didnt just loss me as a customer,  they lost at lest 9 customers that i put up in there hotels.

This place needs  A proper and professional manager on site. Because the management is nice in your face but behind your back there against you..

You're paying them money and they're making you feel like your nothing..  You make a complaint and they tell you , your not aloud to come anymore..why? Is it maybe my honest reviews about your shaddy hotel???

Do not stay here you will be disappointed and you will be unhappy.</text><Date>1531886663466< /Date>< name>

Highs and lows when checking in.  Checked in and didn't have queen size bed so I was upgraded to a king size bed.  Went to the room and the bed was not bed.  The room was not cleaned and it had a strong odor of must.  I told the attendents at the front desk and was told they could give me clean sheets to be placed on the bed.  I had place the bedding on my bed because there was no house keeping staff at the time.  I usually have an excellent service at extended stay whenever I rent but this was the worst experience I've had.   The walls are super thin so I could hear the couple next door clear as day.

Horrible. Horrible horrible horrible. Booked a week and a half in advance and took the 5 hour drive for an event the next morning. When we arrived, we found that they had given our room to someone else. We ended up having to sleep in our vehicle. Horrible location, bad part of town. Overall I wish this trip never happened.<//Text>

If you are looking for good customer service with all the promised amenities - THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU! If you looking bed bugs, wifi that doesn't work, rude and incompetent staff, extremely poor guest relations - then extended stay america is it. There are other hotels in the area that are 1000 times better. Do yourself the favor and run away from this terrible hotel.< /Text>< Pictures>

The maid was dressed in real dirty old cloths, no shirt that even had your name on it, and a half cut off shirt with her stomach sticking out of it, she was a mess. I travel every month or so for work and this was the worse room I ever stayed in. Because I purchased the room on Priceline I could not cancel when I got there, I asked. The property is filthy dirty! Many crack heads live there? The side door you enter through had so much trash piled up, the garbage can is never emptied and there were old dirty clothes on the ground too, I assume there is no grounds keeper! I had to rent a cot because the room did not have 2 beds as I had purchased? Then I was told there were no pillows left to go with the bed and to ask the next night if there were any. I called the next day and I was told there were no pillows. I had one bar of used soap in the shower. I asked if they had cleaned this room? The floor was gross. The guy up front said they do not clean the rooms if I am there for just 2 days. The hallways smelled like weed all hours of the day. It was pretty scary to say the least, and people coming in the side door that I do not think should be there? They came in when we would open the door to leave, they would wait by the door, very shady looking characters, one guy was so messed up by the side door and very scary he was just starring in the door waiting for someone to leave 10pm at night, I had to use the front door to leave. The guy at the fronk desk was very short when he spoke and rude. I told him I wanted to leave the first day I saw the room, he said I could, but no refund, no pillows, no Tv, no soap. There was a gal who looked like she was living in her car, she was real jittery and tryed talking to me I just did not answer, and a tow truck showed up hours later to tow her and she was arguing with the guy. I had my daughter and son with me, I was so worried for our safety the entire time we were there. I slept with a chair against the door handle. I am not sure why you would ask for a review because I doubt you would do anything. Both nights there was a party all night long above us, and the second night as it got later people were arguing, fighting very loud! And I had no TV to drown it out so my kids did not have to hear the fowl language!  I would have spent a little more to get something alittle better, had I know. Of course I did not expect the Hilton. I stayed at an Extended Stay America with my entire family a few years back when we had our reunion and it was nice, and the peope were very nice there too!  I know the price is fair for the area, but not for what I saw and experienced after I arrived. Had I extra money I would have stayed somewhere else and forfeited the money I paid to Priceline. This was a special trip I did for my kids and this was a terrible experience!! I am a single mother on a limited budget and I thought I was getting a decent place for the price this is why I spent alittle more then a $50 motel. And the front desk man who should be a reflection of your place was just aweful! He was rude and could care less I was upset after I saw the room. I do not think I should have been charged for a cot that had no bedding with it either! It makes me teary eyed that my kids were so excited for this trip and I feel like a low life making them stay at this place. I do not get to do many things being a single mom and when I can and have the money I look forward to seeing my kids have a good memorable time with me, this was just not a good experience!  It is a very scetchy place, with very scetchy people living there. I think it does not cost that much to have extra pillows, and tv's that work, and a business shirt for your employees to wear! You could even hire people once in awhile to clean up the garbage on the property. I do not mind either not having any service when I am only staying at a place for 2 days to conserve water and save money for hired help, but I do mind that a place is just somewhat clean and safe and not smelling drugs in the doors by the stairwells. Respectfully, Tracy< /Text>

<text>Stay Away!!! Horrible place to stay. Horrible horrible. One day no toilet paper next would only give one roll for 4 adults. Next day NO clean towels. Told to come back in two hours, two and a half hours still no towels yet. Never washed the ones we returned. Talked to manager(?) and we’re just told to come back in two hours again.

No dishes or coffee. Parking lot trashed and Sketchy people everywhere. Including staff.

I’ve stayed at several ESA in the past. Never again! This place is worst I’ve ever seen.<//text>< Pictures>

Being a traveler I have stayed at numerous Extended stays, and this has by far been my worst experience. The hotel manager Carlos has no sense of customer service. Police are there EVERYDAY, because of constant domestic violence and drug addicts. This hotel should be your LAST option .</Review>

<text>Friendly staff At the lobby... But... The place is bad.... I had to check In after my condo complex had water damage problem for 24hrs. The sheets were not changed! Even after I requested new sheets, I had to do it myself, they dont have any staff except for the lobby clerk. I was itching the whole night.... It said suites... It was more like a motel. If you are looking for a hotel experience, this is not the place.</text>< UserId.>

<review>I wish they had such a thing as negative 5 stars because this hotel would definitely deserve -5!!  I thought hotels were about hospitality?? And taking care of your clients?? Well not at this one!! Your AC doesn't work so you call it in, they will tell you that they will send someone soon to fix it, they never showed up that day. I call on my way back to the hotel the next day and asked to speak to the manager, he assures me the work order has been taken care of. I walk in and the room is still hot and muggy @85 degrees!! The night before when they never came I had to sleep with the windows open and deal with the traffic noise all night.. So I call front desk and Scott answers, I immediately ask for another room and he responds with an attitude and disgust saying that the hotel is completely booked and there are no rooms!! He said he has to come to the room to verify it is not working, so obviously he thought I was lying, and wanted to waste my time and breathe about my AC not working!! He eventually hung up on me which only made me more irate. I had to go down and ask him if he hangs up on all his clients and he refused to talk to me. Once he checked my room out and found out he couldn't fix my AC he decided I could not stay there and said he was kicking me out because I was complaining so much!!! So all this was my fault Bc it's my responsibility for the AC to be working in my room. I immediately called corporate to enter a complain and he called my room back trying to say "Sir I found a room for you" after he had neglected to see what he could do for me in the first place, I told him that's okay I already booked another hotel and was in the process of putting in a complain, his response was "Oh that's nice" like the smart aleck he was since the beginning. I went to check out and ask for a printed receipt and he said he was not going to give me anything. At this point another employee stepped up and said I need to leave because he had put me on a blacklist and BANNED me from all of Extended stay in North America!! I was in complete shock as to how they treated me all because I wanted another room with a working AC. I asked for his name 3 times and his response was "My name is..." Every single time since he didn't want to give me his name. I ended up staying right at the front desk and called corporate again to put in another complaint. Eventually they even called the police on me because they didn't want to give me a receipt and wanted me out of the hotel completely, first a security guard came and Scott said "I don't know where Mike went (this was the name of the employee who banned me) so I immediately said oh that's his name, okay and I wrote it down while I was still on with corporate putting in the second complain, Scott then got furious and asked the security to escort me outside the premises I told him that I was not leaving until they gave me a paper receipt or when I was finished with the second complaint. Once I got done the security guard was very kind and asked me why I was so upset and told him what had happened and he was just as shocked, but he told me outside the hotel he was not surprised because they did the same with another gentleman that had bed bugs in his room and they also acted the same way towards him. I suggest you never stay at this hotel and save yourself the trouble, headaches and money and go to another reputable hotel. Scott and Mike treated me like a piece of s*** and I don't know how they ever got to work there with the lack of customer service they gave me. I just hope they learn their lesson and never treat another client the same way they treated me.<//review>< UserId.>

<Date>1479054054674<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Changes in 5 years @ ESA Woodland Hills -

First time in California, and my office Travel Desk picked this hotel, I was little worried as I was planned to stay there for 3 weeks, and wasnt very sure how the stay will be, but it turned out to be surprising and I was happy with the overall service, and felt it was worth the $$ I was paying. Later, frequent stays in ESAs gave me more confidence, and was getting the patronage, and opted to use ESA over others.

Recent "Attempt" to stay in ESA Woodland hills was horrible - I made the reservation, and just about 20mins before I was about to check-in, I get a call from them saying - 'Sorry we cant honor your reservation, as we're fully occupied'. What a shock - this is about 6:30PM, and we were driving towards the hotel. Did not have different option, rather go place by place and find a different hotel to stay.

I rate it to be negative (-)5, but they dont have that option to choose. A very bitter experience, I will not be using that as an option any more.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29949ee5ec9c3:0x4777bc5421f86520< /gmap_id></record>

When I checked in, the room was way too shabby and despite of repeated instruction it was never cleaned.

The stay would have been better with hygiene.</Review>

< review>
Stayed here several nights while looking for a place to live.  The front desk service was very good. They were professional and accomodating.  I was a little leary when I got to my room as it looked worn out and I felt the need to look for bed bugs.  Once I looked more closely,  I realized everything was clean, it just had a used look.  After the first night, it was clear that the hotel is conscious of energy and resource use as they would only change the sheets for multi-night guests if requested, among other similar practices. This is becoming quite common with hotels anyway plus this is an extended stay, I didn't feel any of the practices were unreasonable. All in all, everything was clean, just dated and used looking. The only real concern I had was that the night I arrived, it was late and even though I had made a reservation, the front doors were locked. Once inside, I was greeted by someone in cleaning staff uniform who did not speak much English at all. Had I had any issues or concerns at that moment, they would not have been addressed or resolved as this employee would not have been able to help me. Otherwise, great service.</review>

<Text>No es un hotel. Lo que hacen es alquilar los cuartos. Estuve 6 días, nunca limpiaron la habitación, ni cambiaron las toallas y menos las sabanas. Las instalaciones están muy descuidadas y maltratadas, la limpieza es demasiado pobre. Cuando me dieron la habitación yo tuve q limpiar el microondas, y las puertas de los gabinetes de la cocina. De por si estaban sucios por dentro.<//Text>< pics>

El hotel está bien ubicado, las habitaciones grandes, pero la limpieza es demasiado mala, tiene mal olor los pasadizos y el cuarto. El baño estaba lleno de pelos y polvo acumulado que se notaba que no se había limpiado en un tiempo, la cortina del baño manchada del uso y que no la habían lavado en un tiempo. El cuarto estaba ordenado, pero no bien limpio, el teléfono tenía bastante polvo acumulado, no lo habían limpiado en varios días, el basurero de la cocina solo la habían recogido, pero no limpiado alrededor, habían papeles que obvio que no eran míos. Una de las orillas de la cocina estaba rota y no cuentan nisiquiera con cafetera. El desayuno es una burla. Para lo que cuesta pagas unos dólares más y te vas a cualquier hotel similar pero bueno.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Of the worst, they did not want to give me an extra pillow, they only give three towels per room, it does not matter if the guests are a couple with two children, you have to go to reception to change the towels, the cleaning is done every 7 days, the beds are small for two people and what they call a suite, it is nothing more than a small room where the refrigerator is next to the beds and does not let you sleep.

De lo peor, no quisieron darme una almohada extra, solo dan tres toallas  por habitación no importa si los huéspedes son una pareja con dos niños, tienes que ir a recepción a cambiar las toallas, la limpieza se hace cada 7 días, las camas son pequeñas para dos personas y lo que ellos llaman suite , no es más que una pequeña habitación donde la refrigeradora queda a la par de las camas y no deja dormir.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I do not consider it to be a hotel of God stars and a half as it was published. The carpet was stained, we found Rosa from a previous guest under the armchair, we were only given a double bed and I was traveling with my two daughters. I would not go back.

(Original)
No considero que sea un hotel de Dios estrellas y media como estaba publicado. La alfombra estaba manchada, nos encontramos Rosa de un huésped anterior debajo del sillón, sólo nos dieron una cama tamaño matrimonial e iba viajando con mis dos hijas. No volvería.</text>
