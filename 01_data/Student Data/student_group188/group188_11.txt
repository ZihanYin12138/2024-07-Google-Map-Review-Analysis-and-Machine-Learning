<date>1620927527455</date><rating>5<//rating><text>Everyone at this office is awesome! So friendly! I’ve never really liked the dentist office and my daughter needed braces and some other things done and I was so scared for her to go to a place I hated as a child but she LOVES going to this office. She LOVES the staff. She’s usually shy but she is so talkative with the everyone there because she feels so comfortable. She asks questions and the doctors explain everything to her so that she (and I) understand. They work around your schedule and are affordable. I will always use them, no one else!<//text>< pictures>

I love Bear creek! They have the best customer service and when I was looking for a dental group for my two year old they were the first to really respond to my concerns and made the whole experience for him very comfortable. They’re just great overall!!</review>

I have been here three times and every time I have come in, I experience wonderful service from the office ladies, dentist and dental assistant.  Doctor Sanders is knowledgeable and friendly and he is honest in dealing with my dental treatment.  Never leave feeling that the recommended treatment was unnecessary and I always feel I’m in good hands.  Alisa is always accommodating and friendly and makes me feel like I’m part of the family.  Wonderful dental office!</Review>

Dr. Do is the kindest, most caring dentist I've ever met. My daughter is terrified of dental procedures and Dr. Do took the time to sit with her and comfort her through a difficult root canal procedure. Everyone in this office has treated my daughter like family. They are always kind and understanding even when my daughter repeatedly waits too long to get treatment. I've also had dental work done here and they were amazingly patient and kind to me. I highly recommend Dr. Do and Bear Creek Dental!<//review>

<review>10/10 would recommend! This office has an amazing staff. The front desk is super welcoming, friendly and
professional! The office is super clean and practices all necessary Covid-19 precautions.
Shout out to Jenn for always greeting me with a smile!

Additionally, I’ve had AMAZING results! I’ve been going to this office for the past two years and and I’ve been blown away by the work they do every time. My mouth is always minty fresh when I walk out!!!!

Dr. Arad has outstanding bedside manner. He always makes me feel comfortable and has a super gentle hand; never hurts the inside of my mouth like other orthodontists/ Dentists. Thank you, Dr!< /review><Date>1621384595789<//Date>< username>

<name>Carol Grieve< /name><Date>1596485474790<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>In November 2018, I received 4 crowns from Dr. Do at Bear Creek Dental. My front tooth was chipping and even though these teeth were sound, she advised that it would probably be best to do this. I agreed. I continued to go to my every three month cleanings and also received lasers to assist with my gums. Something did not feel right with the teeth and I expressed this to the doctor. She sent me to their endodontist to have him look at them. He found nothing wrong. This was in the early part of 2019. I was still feeling numbness in the area above my teeth and nobody could find anything. Fast forward to June, 2020, a year and a half after paying $4,000 for crowns, every one of those 4 crowns failed and I had infections on every tooth, even though I had cared for them by doing the deep cleanings which they suggested and the laser. The other two dentists that took xrays and saw the amount of infection were extremely surprised that these crowns were only 1-1/2 years old. I asked Bear Creek Dental for a full refund and did not get a response. I was on a payment plan with them and they did allow me to quite paying the balance which was $1,400. I am disappointed that the did not even respond to my request. I have since had these teeth pulled and am wearing a denture now. I do not recommend a dentist who cannot stand by their work. Crowns should not fail in a year and a half. Secondly, they did not even respond to my request.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I haven't had my time wasted like this in years! $750 to remove 3 brackets. That is 3x the cost of everywhere place I went to. They owe me $750 for wasting my time. Good thing I record my phone calls!</review>

<Text>This is one of the best dentist experiences I've ever had. All the staff I've dealt with have been great. Dr. Sanders was very sweet, attentive, and thorough. He took the time to talk to me when I was nervous about a procedure and to discuss my dental fears (going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do). They were also great with my 3 year old. The receptionists are super friendly. I have nothing but good things to say about this place.</Text>< Rate>

<review>I wish I could give this place a negative 5 star review. STAY AWAY YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I went in for a check up and cleaning today not expecting to get a Quote. Since I didn’t have $1,000 to cough up (that’s with insurance) I agreed to pay the $152 for a deep cleaning at least. I waited for the lady to get a with cash in hand which I’ve never done she came back and said they didn’t have time to schedule a appointment. Metaphorically speaking I went in for an oil change and they were trying to sell me a car. This place is MONEY HUNGRY!! I first saw a hygienist who told me I needed a deep cleaning and a bacterial rinse the doctor who asked if I grind my teeth then a desk lady with a quote. I then asked just basic questions and she said I would have to talk to the doctor who had already went home. The DOCTORS NAME IS DR.PARK. For the record I have no cavities and just was there in October.</review><user_id>103552384215721791476< /user_id>< Response>

<review>My husband had some dental work done with Dr. Choi and Dr. Do. He was extremely nervous and really just did not want to have it done. Dr. Do has been amazing from the start. She helped me out over the phone before she ever saw my husband. Both Dr. Do and Dr. Choi were so amazingly helpful, kind, patient and gentle with husband. I have never received the type of service she offered by any other health care professionals. We are definitely patients for life.</review>< Resp>

Dr. Lin and the Hygienist Carmen were great! I went in for a check up and they worked with me in regards to pricing, care, and cleaning for the work that i desperately needed done. They were flexible with me and got me as soon as possible.

Yes there was a wait in the waiting room but I just scheduled that in to my appointment as everyone should know stuff like this comes up where you need to wait 10 more minutes. The quality care was outstanding. The staff was friendly, helpful, and caring to my condition, I am glad that we caught the work that was needed to do in time to save me thousands of dollars in bills and permanent damages.</Text>

Friendly staff and excellent dentists/specialists.  I recently had a root canal/cap done at Bear Creek dental, and they whole process was painless and easy.  Special shout-outs to Jim Park (dentist), Rachel (assistant) and the front area staff.  I highly recommend this place.<//text>

<Text>First off let me say I love the staff and dentists here and have been a patient for many years.
My elderly mom is disabled and had a set of old dentures.  They were old dentures but she could eat with them fine.
She has a small bottom jaw so her old provider left in about six teeth so her dentures would fit.
I took her to see Dr. Park . He said her teeth needed to come out and although her jaw is a bit hard to fit, they can give her a much better set, and  they could have the surgeon pull her teeth and build up her gum.
When I took her in for the surgery,  she was in the room for not even 10 minutes. I thought something was wrong when they called me back to the room. He was done!!
He didn't put her under,  nor did he build up her gums. He just ripped out her teeth.
Now, thousands of dollars later and many visits, she can't eat anything that needs to be chewed.
Her top teeth are very crooked and the bottoms fall out no matter how gum paste she uses.
All they tell her is, her mouth is hard to fit!
My niece and I paid thousands of dollars on our credit cards for Mom.
I had moved out of state and when I saw her teeth recently, I cried.  She cries all the time because she cannot chew food anymore.
Do not go to their surgeon! He's  terrible and ruined my mom's mouth.  I'm still paying for her work on my credit card.<//Text>< Pictures>

To start off the entire crew is so nice and knowledgeable.  They are great to help with payment.  They also make me fell comfortable. Dr. Lim is a great doctor I have been searching for a dentist that I like and finally found one.  He also worked on my daughter and the care he took with her not to frighten her was above and beyond what he needed to do. I recommend anyone searching for a dentist go here and see Dr. Lim he is great.</text>

READ THE OTHER LOW REVIEWS FIRST!  YOU WILL NOTICE A COMMON THREAD AMONG ALL!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$  It is all about the $$ here!

First visit, fix a lost filling.  Great!  Got my daughter in quickly and no issues
Went again for cleaning.  They pushed her appointment back 30 min and didn't tell us prior or at check in.  Made her wait 30 as well.  So she sat in the waiting room with a recently broken foot for 1 hr.
Ok, will try again..... she went for a cleaning.  Tried to upsell her on more advanced cleaning with laser and partial crown ($150 total).  Was very suspicious, about Doctors explanation.  Sounded like a normal adult cleaning to me, and it wasn't a crown, but a porcelian layer.  Ok, so I "bought" his sales pitch.  Except her tooth has needed 2 more visits since and she still can't eat off it.
you think we would have learned, but today my son went in.... they tried to upsell him by $500!  2 filings (I am sorry, those are covered by our insurance) and then that same laser treatment (oh, the one his sister needed a week ago for $150?).
Place is complete use car upsell mentality.  We have Delta Dental insurance, so cleanings and cavities are covered, yet they want $650 extra and even when they got extra money, their work wasn't even good!!!!
Those are purely the facts, decide for yourself.</Text>

This is a review for Bear Creek Dental Group. Some of the pictures are not of the place I went to, so I'm not sure the other reviewers are reviewing the same place as i am. Anyway, I'm a big crybaby when it comes to going to the dentist. But (almost) everyone I interacted with was unbelievably nice, which made my 7-hour visit bearable (I got x-rays, deep cleaning, and 3 crown placements.) I am extremely grateful they baby'd me while making sure I was as comfortable as possible the whole time. One thing I would strongly suggest is to bring something to do while waiting in the exam rooms, I don't know why they don't have televisions. Also, some exam rooms are really cold during the summer, so dress in warm clothes.</Text>

I went in for a simple extraction and now I have 2 payments one of $174 and approved for credit card of $1500 payments of $125. I'm retired and on a fixed income. $300 a month is absolutely ridiculous. And to top it off my teeth dont feel the same. I cant chew correctly.  I will never be going to there again and dont recommend them.< /Text>< pics>

Amazing is what I can say.  We recently moved to Murrieta and looked for a new kids dentist and met Becca at a kids baseball game and she told us where she worked.  Myself deathly terrified of the dentist (going in gives me panic attacks) took my 4, 7 & 9 year old to see Dr. Park.  Keep in mind it's not a full on kids dental office so no TV's, video games in the rooms.

We walked in and the staff is welcoming and made it more comfortable.  Becca took us back and cleaned my youngest kiddo's teeth.  She took pictures (not x-ray) of her teeth to see if they could see anything wrong without exposing her to radiation. Dr. Park came in and looked and said she was good.  A few hours later we returned with my middle kiddo.  Same process but her got x-rays too.  He ended up having 3 cavities and what I didn't expect was them to be able to fill them right then and there. That was awesome. No return visit, less anxiety in my life.   Turns out we needed an orthodontic consult so they were able to schedule us for that for the next week. Same with my oldest in needing an orthodontic consult.

Dr. Park & Becca are amazing with all 3 kids and super patient with them.  Puts my mind at ease while being there.

We will be returning again and have already referred strangers to the office.< /text>

I do not recommend this place at all. Only came here because I had to change insurances and my old dentist did not take the new one. Came in in quick because I had a horrible tooth ache that would not stop for three days. I call and they get me in next morning and sounded extremely nice. I come in first thing and everyone is very nice but I know now that's just because they want to take advantage of you. I was in so much pain and the dentist comes in (young guy with a man bun) he does his inspection and decides my tooth has to be extracted because it is cracked. I asked why I was so swollen (my cheek was swollen) because I was pretty sure it was infected. He says no, its not infected its just the nerves irritated. He tells me ill be in pain until i remove the tooth, so i said okay when can we remove it. Not until a week and a half later! I say okay can I get pain meds to help until then (he did) They then have the girl come in with ofcourse the most expensive option out there that the insurance doesn't cover. (which he did tell me the implant would be most expensive) but why only come in with that option...I ask for the other options which they leave and have to come back with, but I then notice my insurance copay was different then the amounts they stated. I then ask why because I had it up on my phone and they say oh oh we can change it because this is a specialist which is a different insurance code....Okay why try to pull it past me when it was a HUGE difference. I go home to think about all the options and when I call to schedule the removal they schedule with the specialist without even telling me. I only knew because I asked and I said does this have to be done by the specialist to extract one tooth and they said no but she is "soooo great". okay...  no, all is sketchy. I then call my old dentist because I trust them and they begged me to come in or get a second opinion because it all sounded off to them. (That dentist is all the way in Santa Monica) and being in so much pain I didn't want to drive all the way out there. I sent them pictures and they said "honey you are infected" we can tell just by looking at you, you need antibiotics.  I decided to go to Urgent Care and the doctor said the same thing, its very obvious you're infected you need to go to dentist, I said I just did! She said they didn't give you antibiotics, i said no they just want to remove my tooth. She shuck her head and said "you need a new dentist" She gave me a shot of antibiotics, steroids and antibiotics to take for 10 days... She said if they would have removed this tooth with this infection, it could have easily spread and made matters much worse. You need to be on antibiotics and remove the infection before you remove the tooth....WOW who knows what would have happened if i went back... I am now better and went back to my dentist (I dont have insurance with) and they checked to say my tooth does NOT need to be removed, it is not cracked. Its so sad that someone was trying to take advantage of me while in pain. I will be calling my insurance to change to another provider.< /Text>

Where do I begin? When I first called I was greeted by probably the most friendliest receptionist I have every encountered, Ashley, she was well spoken, had exceptional knowledge about products and services. She had also was very accommodating with helping me with setting my appointments to the hair stylist I was needing.

When I arrived I was again greeted by Ashley with positivity and welcomed vibes. My first stylist was Makaela who was also amazing and friendly. I also really appreciated that she knew how to work with curly hair and totally transformed my uneven hair to a perfect cut. I also received an amazing essential oil scalp massage.

I went to get my hair colored by Joel. Oh Joel, you truly transformed my hair and my attitude to a more confident and sexy women. He was thorough, he explained everything he was doing well. And I left the salon feeling amazing!!

I am so happy with my experience there and I would highly recommend this salon!! They are all so happy and friendly. It was completely worth the trip to Redding.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Resp>None</Resp><text>I got side swept bangs and they turned out terrible. I cried when I left. They were so uneven and she didn’t even wet my hair she just started cutting. I had to have my mom fix my bangs never again!!!! Also I made is pretty clear that I didn’t like them too much and she let me leave disappointed. She was also arguing with me when I asked her to add more hair In to make them thicker. She said that it would make my bangs shorter. How? You just add hair and cut it the same length.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Being new to Redding, I didn’t know where to go or who to trust with cutting and styling my hair. I ABSOLUTELY loved having Ashley today and highly recommend her and this salon to anyone! The woman that checked me out was knowledgeable on products that may help with what I was looking for to take home and support me with my goal of having my hair be healthier and less damaged. 5 stars all around! ❤️< /text>< pics>

And I LOVED it! I had the best experience I have EVER had in a salon. It definitely was more spa like, hence why it is called a hair spa. All the staff were so friendly and eager to help, you know, actually good customer service! I had Caitlin do my hair. She is an absolute doll! She gave me the best hair I have ever had. Isn't that essentially what we're all looking for? If it is, you need to gry Boheme, you'll fall in love. Wonderful products too, clean and welcoming space. And they offer yummy coffee, tea and water. Such a nice place!</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x54d29332d1661a25:0xdc0d8afe53105562<//GmapID></record>

< review>
Pretty disappointed with how my hair turned out. I went in for a perm, showed a photo of what I wanted, and walked out with very very loose curls and the front mostly straight - not at all what I had wanted. I called back to see what my options were to fix it, and they brought me in, shampooed it, put a ton of product in it, and said I needed to work on styling it. I left with wavy hair that went straight by the end of the day again. I was told it just didn't stick in my hair, but I've had a perm before with no issues (and no need for product to keep it curly all day). They mentioned doing another half perm as a last resort, but I'm not sure I want to go back since clearly they don't think there's an issue with how it turned out.<//review>

<review>Boheme turned out to be a huge disappointment and I won't ever go back. I had a color done and ended up going back to correct it , which they did for free and I appreciated but both times I felt really rushed and the way she styled my hair was down right awful. I was shocked that a trained stylist would make her client walk out the door looking like that. I was thankful I didn't need to stop anywhere before I got home, where, both times I immediately wet my hair and restyled. Elana offered no customer service when it came to listening to my request for my hair. Hopefully I'm the only one who experienced this with her!</review>< pictures>

This place is all around amazing! I have never had a bad experience. Mikayla always does a fabulous job with my hair and Samantha’s facials are the best! Jewels has been doing my nails with gel polish and she is amazing! I love the ocean art she just did for me!!!< /Text>

Im a guy with long hair.  They all do a great job.  I used to go to the $15 places like super cuts but this salon has my hair longer, fuller, softer and managed.  I feel like a rock star.  Happy...  AAAAA++++<//Review>

Went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. I made a hair appointment last minute and was told that the only stylist available was Janie (sp?). As it turns out, it worked perfectly! I enjoyed a wonderful conversation with her while she cut my hair to perfection - and that's not to mention the lovely scalp and neck massage with essential oils and the conditioning treatment. I'm extremely picky with my hair stylists, not because I'm a difficult person, but because my hair is so difficult! I truly have pity on anyone who has to work with my thick mane. But I was pleasantly surprised to find someone who was ready and able to deal with my hair so well. Aside from her incredible skills, Janie is a lovely person, and it was truly a pleasure getting to know her. I will definitely be back soon.< /text>

I am so sad about the way my hair turned out. The stylist cut off all the areas I asked to keep the legnth on,  and didn't do what I asked for in the back. I have a pixie cut, so it's pretty important to be listened to when it comes to what I want in regards to the shape.
When I showed her a picture if how I wanted the back of my hair to lock ( when it didn't turn out how I had asked) she told me that that style wouldn't grow out well and that what I currently had was better.  She was very nice, but didn't listen at all and my hair looks terrible for my face shape. I left in tears, and I feel so unfeminine with this cut. I'm sure she's wonderful at her job, because there's nothing wrong with the technical aspects of the cut, it's just not what I asked for.  Also it was more expensive than what their website States and there's no warning until you hand them your card.</Text>

My husband gets haircuts here and they turn out well, but I went here for my bridal hair and makeup and thank God I did a trial first. Ended up cancelling the services for the wedding because the work looked nothing like the pictures I brought in... I asked for curled hair with one braid in the back, which turned out sloppy. The makeup I asked for was simple (even the makeup artist said so), so I'm not sure why it turned out to look nothing like the picture, especially the foundation which was terribly cakey. Ended up doing it myself and liked the results much better, as did my bridal party and the groom. Thankfully I was able to talk to a manager and get a "refund" for the half of the services that I didn't actually receive on the wedding day since I cancelled. Yikes.</text></record></dataset><record>

I'm so sad, I went in wanting flowy blended layers and it just looks chopped and not what I wanted I went in a second time to have her fix it, I showed her a picture and everything,  she asked me if I want to keep this length as a v look and I said yes, she cut it a lot shorter than what I agreed to and she gave me the smallest v in the middle instead of a big long v shape for my layers,  she blow dryd it and "styled it" but when I woke up the next morning to really see how it'll lay it still looked choppy so I'm really dissapointed I spent $40 on my cut and I will never ever go here again. I've never been somewhere where they did such a choppy job. Huge Rip off<//text>

I love Boheme, and my slylist is Ashley. I love coming to this place because of the environment, and not only that! You get for what you pay for.  All the stylist are amazing until I found the perfect one for me. Ashley is so my girl, and she will be my stylist until I move to another State. Lol. That's if I do. I also love all the AVEDA products. Thank you Boheme Salon and Spa, I will forever be faithful to you.</Text>

I went there as a walk-in for a brow waxing. It was later in the evening and Ashley, the waxer (I'm sorry I don't know the technical title for her Profession) has already shut down for the evening but totally reheated her wax just for me. Super comfortable room and atmosphere. Great job, totally felt like a pampered, spa experience. Waaaaay better than the standard waxing facilities! I cannot stress that enough, spa experience. Ashley was a sweet pea that I immediately felt comfortable and at ease with. Seriously considering my first bikini wax after being too uncomfortable to do it at any other place.
A couple days later, my guy and I got manicures at the sister location. ALSO a great spa, pampered feeling experience! We're going to book pedicures next week. Highly recommended, we will being going here for all future needs.< /Text>

I have been looking for a new salon to have my hair done and was very impressed with the service provided not only by Ricki (the stylist that did my hair) but the rest of the staff as well.  I have had several bad experiences in the past at different salons that I went to in the bay area so I was nervous about trying another new place.  I am so glad I did.  I have made this my new place to go; I have even made an appointment to go back for one of their spa packages!!!  Thanks Ricki and the Boheme staff for making my experience wonderful!</Text></record>

My experience at Boheme has been outstanding! I've been going there for facials, hair color/cut and product for over a year. Natalie knew what I was trying to do and gave me the results I had been searching for and hadn't found even in other Aveda salons (which I've always went to). I've never had such a great chair experience. I always leave feeling uplifted. I also have had facials with the owner - Aly. Wow! My face had never felt better nor have I ever felt more pampered. I've had acne for years and she helped clear me up and advised me on proper skin care. The product line - amazing! Damage Remedy does for my hair what the stuff on the shelves of the health food store can't all while being the natural products I love! I highly recommend Boheme to anyone and everyone! Great people the place!< /Text>

The staff is amazing from the always peppy greeting from the front to the professional and bubbly demeanor of my hairstylist, Jana.

I am getting married and chose to get a true radiance facial, and false eyelashes put on. Ashley did both my facial and my eyelashes and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!! She did SUCH an AMAZING JOB!!!!!! My skin feels like butta, and my eyelashes are without a doubt the BEST MONEY EVER SPEND!!!!! Ashley took her time to make sure everything was perfect!!! Very thoughtful regarding my skin as to NOT breaking out before I get married, AND to discuss different possibles regarding the length and look of my lashes!!!! SHE CARES!!!!!
I cannot give her enough props and hype!!!! She may be young, but she is SO well versted in skin needs and what products are best for those needs!!! A++++++ for Ashley and A++++ for the spa!!!! It wasnt as expensive as expected, but I still spent as much as I would have just tipping Ashley!!!! SHE DESERVES IT!!!! Thank you Boheme Spa and Ashley for making me look AMAZING for my wedding!!!!!!!<//Review>

In less than 30 minutes I was in a chair, which was very impressive. My stylist Mikayla was absolutely amazing. She knew exactly what I wanted after only one explanation, I know it must be difficult to interpret exactly what a client wants but this girl was a pro. She colored my hair perfectly and cut it just the way I like it. The price was very reasonable, I was served beverages while I waited, and I was amazed at how expedient this stylist was at her craft. Very talented. Loved the whole experience. Definitely will be making boheme my new regular spot, and hopefully mikayla can be my stylist everytime! For pictures of my hair check out their FB page!<//text><gmapID>0x54d29332d1661a25:0xdc0d8afe53105562</gmapID></record>

<Review>EVERY TIME I COME TO THIS PLACE I LEAVE DISAPPOINTED. This is my first time ever putting a review for any establishment/ services ever. And I wouldn’t even think of writing this if I wasn’t this UPSET with this Western Dental location! First of all the customer service is AWFUL! I’ve worked in customer service so as much as possible I try to understand that sometimes there are things that are out of their hands. But this location....the receptionist looked and sounded like they didn’t want to be there, the man managing the front just sounded like he doesn’t care. My brother and I drive 45 minutes to this location because this was the only one with the appointment as soon as possible. The customer service representative in the phone set us our appointment and we thought the problem would be resolved. We were wrong.

Our first time in the establishment, we overheard a patient ( as the waiting room is small) coming in for a procedure that the customer representative said would be taken care of at this location. Like us this was the only location that had availability that day so he went there with expectations. He was usually going to a different branch but because he was really needed to be seen he set the appointment. Boy he was mad after learning that they cannot anything! Anyone would be too! The man I was referring to earlier turned him without even apologizing. He said he needed to be seen in his usual location. Like why did customer service even let the patient set that appointment if that will be the case?!!

That should’ve been a RED FLAG.

As you have already guessed, my brother’s issue was not resolved. The dentist said that his problem needed a specialist and wanted to refer us to somewhere else. We came back for another crown that he needed and was told to come back a few weeks for his permanent crown. Take in mind that we already drove 45min- 1hour here and we didn’t want to just go home without anything.

The man said said he would sent over the referral form via email in the next hour or so but we didn’t get it until the next day. He didn’t give us any possible dental offices to call so I called Western Dental customer services to find out. They transferred me to the location and talked to the receptionist who didn’t know what’s going on with my brother’s case and said they’d call us back before noon once they get more information. We waited and nothing! We were so upset and just decided to look for another dentist closer to ours. WE FOUND A GENERAL DENTIST that could do it. NOT A SPECIALIST! When we asked the new dentist about it, she found it very weird that we were turned down in this location and needed to be referred to a specialist.

Anyways, we came back for the permanent crown to be placed but apparently they didn’t have it. THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS! We drove an hour because of traffic to come back to this horrendous dental office only to be DISAPPOINTED YET AGAIN. I asked the man if they even left a message to us that they didn’t have the crown yet and this man just said no. No. expression. No apologies for wasting our time. Nothing. He didn’t even check their mail and storage until we checked in. We rescheduled for hopefully last time coming here. I asked him specifically to call us before the next appointment. This morning they called and to no surprise they still don’t have it. It’s ridiculous.

Don’t do what we did and give your business to somewhere else. Patients deserve to feel cared for and this dental office obviously do not care.< /Review>< pictures>

The office manager Daniel ( who refuses to give his last name now) led me to my seat to wait after my x rays. The dentist was still busy with another patient . Daniel read me my dental x rays and diagnosed me before the dentist even got there. He unnecessarily  and unprofessionally alarmed me by diagnosing me WRONG!! He was giving me advice and telling me what to do and over stepping the Indian dentist. I called to speak with the staff about getting the tooth fixed , he immediately jumped on the phone and would not let me speak to the receptionist????? I asked to speak with her again and he said no. I asked for his name and he only stated his first. I asked him how he as an business manager was able to interpret xrays, diagnose and Patients without a dentist and he stated he does it all. The office is nice, the staff is nice but this guy was the worse !</Review>

I thought they were in Irvington so I was 16 minutes late according to my phone as I was walking up for my emergency appt. The young girl at the front was so rude and smug when she said they cancelled my appointment because I was more than 15 minutes late. Then she asked for my card and I'm thinking oh she is gonna help me and she hands it back and says they wouldn't see me anyway because this wasn't my home office. I have never received such rude service at the Mowry office. That girl shouldn't be dealing with customers. I'll never go there again!</Text>

<Review>I don’t know what to say. I was there for a simple teeth cleaning. And after 1 hour and 40 minutes, I haven’t even STARTED the cleaning.
And they wanted to charge me $250 for a CLEANING!!! I have never seen anything like these.
DO NOT GO TO THIS OFFICE.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

No respect to customers. Will force you to sign certain agreements that will charge you thousand of dollars. The business guy manipulates the entire consultation process, and the oral surgeon. The oral surgeon will coordinate with what the business guy says. Don’t do business with them because they will lie to you about the treatment you REALLY need.< /Text>

<text>RUDE FRONT DESK. I am new to the place . I was having chip tooth with great pain and I am the first for appointment on that day. The FRONT DESK GUY made me to wait for more than 1 hr., letting everyone and spoke badly that he is checking my insurance eligibility. He spoke rudely that I wasted his time and he did not check me in at least to have check up with dentist .  The VERY worst place , I felt very bad and left with PAIN AND WITHOUT TREATMENT.< /text>< Pictures>

She explains the treatment very clearly and makes sure you understand what kind of treatment you need and why. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. The office is very nice and clean.

<Text>Im new to the area & was looking for a dentist. I made an appointment online. (Fast & easy!) Went to my appt at 9:3O am, didnt see the dentist till 11! The receptionist, long hair & a little heavy set werent friendly at all. No hello, no smile, no nothing just enjoying her starbucks frappe. Well, They did some xrays after a good hour wait in the lobby. Cool! The girl that did the xray was really nice. After another 30mins of waiting, finally saw the dentist. (its about time!) She checked my teeth, etc. Ask me why im there, i explained to her that hey I havent seen a dentist since I moved to the state, & that I started having pain 3 days prior to my appt. The receptiontist who was drinking her frappe up front was there assisting the dentist. She was telling me that my insurance will not pay for the crown & that the root canal needs to be approved by insurance to get it done (4-6 weeks to wait from the insurance) & that even if it get approved, I need to have the crown which is $1200! Bottom line is that if i dont have $1200 for a crown, they wont do anything! I even told them I dont have that money because Im only working part time because I have a baby. THEY STILL KEEP INSISTING NOT TO EXTRACT THE TOOTH! (When its a back tooth!) It’s all about the money!  Dont go to this place if you dont have money in hand because they wont do anything for you. I wasted 3 hours of my day & missed a day of work because I was there waiting for 3 hours for nothing! Disappointing! & the receptionist might need to consider looking for another job because you cant be working with “patients” if you arent patient with their question & concerns instead of giving them attitude.<//Text></record>

I visited a western dental office and saw Dr Navpreet Arora (license 64217) for a routine exam and simple cleaning. I had the exact same cleaning 8 months earlier with no issues. After my exam, she told me my teeth look great and I am doing a great job. But when it was time to have the cleaning, I was told I needed a peri-maintenance cleaning even though I have no periodontal disease simply because I had one “5” reading in the very back of my mouth where my wisdom tooth abuts another molar...something that has been unchanged for the last 40 years. They also tried to get me to pay $200 for an irrigation that I didn’t need and $1200 for a night guard I didn’t need. I refused their treatment because I felt they were manipulating the readings simply to get me to pay for a service I am already entitled to through my dental plan. She was also unprofessional and argumentative when I questioned her. The only reason I had to go beyond six months for this exam was because there was an hour wait on the day my original appointment was scheduled and so I had to reschedule. They then called and rescheduled that second appointment because they weren’t working after all at the time and day they gave me...forcing me to make a third appointment more than a month later.  The staff member who was trying to force me to pay more was sitting in the exam room during my exam obviously waiting to quote me anything and everything possible to go beyond the routine exam, x-rays and cleaning my plan allows.  She was also unprofessional and rude.  I can’t state enough how my family and I will NEVER  ever go there again and I highly recommend anyone reading this finds another dental office!  I also filed a complaint with the ADA in California immediately following my visit.< /Text>

We went here 5 months ago for new dentures. We paid in FULL a couple thousand dollars. Since then we had to go back for measuring again  and again 3 times. Have been told countless times that they should be ready and make appointments only to have the office call and cancel the appointment because they didn't receive the dentures. Meanwhile trying to live with broken old dentures has been a pain (literally).

Don't pay until you receive what need, they only care about taking money not if service has been provided<//text>

I have always been afraid of the dentist but my dentist Sara Hamed is the best ever! She always makes me feel comfortable and she takes her time to explain everything. She's gentle and very friendly. The staff here is excellent as well. Very friendly and they always remember my name. Smile care in Fremont is the best! I highly recommend it to everyone!<//text>

I am so very glad to have found this dental office thanks to my friend who told me about it. She brings her two teenage daughters to this office and has always said they give very good service and do great dental work! So I thought I should give them a try. I am very grateful to Ms. Yuni who made me feel very welcomed and took extra time to explain my insurance coverage.  I really liked the office, it's very clean and it shows they care about their patients. I talked to a few people in the lobby and they also recommended the office.<//text>

Pro Tip: When you call their number, to reach their actual office Press "6", which is NOT listed as an option to choose. Otherwise, you will be sent to the Western Dental call center and will be in a perpetual loop of insanity.

I only know this because any of the other options connects you to the Western Dental call center. I called their listed number on google multiple times trying to connect to their front desk, but each time the call was forwarded to the call center and the staff on the other end of the line kept forwarding my call back to the number listed in google in a constant loop. No matter which option you choose, other than the UNlisted 6, you get the call center. Finally someone who knew what was happening was on the other end and told me about the hidden Option Number 6 and I was finally able to reach the front desk.

Second Pro Tip: Don't go here.

I contacted this office saying I just moved to the area and need a general dentist with someone in the office who has experience with permanent retainers in case the glue breaks off and I need it re-affixed, and I also want it occasionally checked as well to see if it is still holding strong or needs repair. They assured me that they can do this, so I booked an appointment to get my retainer checked, a teeth cleaning, xrays, and cavities filled. Basic stuff.

I show up for my appointment 15 minutes early, check in, fill out the usual paperwork for new patients, etc. I am waiting *30* minutes passed my appointment time, no one else is in the waiting room, I received no further acknowledgement from the front desk, and it is nearing the end of their business hours so I get up and ask how much longer is it going to be, it is 30 minutes passed my appointment time and it seems like the staff are just socializing in the back. The lady indicates above her head saying my name is on the board and I will be seen when they are available to see me. I ask her to check if they know I am waiting because it is 30 minutes passed my appointment time. She gets up and checks, and I am called right away.

They take xrays, sit me in the backroom, and say they don't do permanent retainers, which is the PRIMARY reason I chose this place. They also don't have enough time to do a cleaning. Which is the second primary reason why I even showed up, and they probably would have had time to do a cleaning if they didn't ignore me for the first 30 minutes of my appointment... They also didn't have it in their schedule to do cavity filling so they weren't going to do that either.

So, I contacted ahead of time to get my permanent retainer checked, teeth cleaning, and cavities filled, and they accommodate ZERO of this, despite that being the whole reason  for this appointment. Plus, false advertising of saying they can check permanent retainers but when I get there and am sitting in their chair, they can't do it all of a sudden. Cool. Would have booked somewhere else.

Complete waste of my time.

Unfortunately, they convinced me to reschedule the appointment and they assured me they would do the cleaning and cavities. I call that morning to confirm the cleaning and cavities, show up, check in, confirm the cleaning and cavity fillings, and this time they bring me to the back right away...

Only for me to wait, without anyone checking on me, for *30 minutes*, before I get up out of the chair and go find someone.

The person I find is the one who brought me back into the room, and she asks me what I showed up for. What? Shouldn't they know? So, they just let random people hang out in their chairs to stare at the paint?

Turns out, even though I called before my appointment to verify I will get a cleaning and cavities filled, and I verified when I checked in that I am here for cleaning and cavities, they dropped my appointment out of their system or had nothing scheduled for me, or no record of any of it at all, or I don't even know what because nothing I can think of makes sense to me. Meanwhile, I passed a room full of staff just socializing and having a grand ol' time doing absolutely nothing.< /text>

<review>I am so very glad to have found this dental office thanks to my friend who told me about it. She brings her two teenage daughters to this office and has always said they give very good service and do great dental work! So I thought I should give them a try. I am very grateful to Ms. Yuni who made me feel very welcomed and took extra time to explain my insurance coverage.  I really liked the office, it's very clean and it shows they care about their patients. I talked to a few people in the lobby and they also recommended the office.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Would not recommend to even my enemy. Went there as my insurance has this office under DMO plan. After their initial mess up in appointments,  we went there for 2 appointments for myself and my wife. After initial set of X-rays, which in my experience was more than required, they took me to examination room where Doctor came and did a quick check up of my mouth and told me that you would need this much treatment. Upon asking whether this would cover under my insurance plan, doctor said that would be checked and someone would stop by and let me know how much the expense would be. After waiting few mins, the front desk person stopped by with a whopping estimate of more than $750 bucks. I just came to this office for my regular cleaning of teeth which according to my insurance plan is fully covered, which they refused to do, saying since diagnosis came for more deep cleaning they can't do regular cleaning as it would spread out the problem. I don't understand how can normal routine cleaning would further cause issues. They just want to mint money by doing unnecessary procedures not covered by insurance and refused to do normal procedures covered fully by insurance. It's just another way of making money.

If you don't care about money, then this might be the place to go. And this was the estimate they gave after our insurance. God only knows how much they will estimate for people without insurance.</review>

Dr. Arora and her staff are the best. My name is Raj H Joshi and they treated me with kindness and respect; fixed me all up. These  mix Punjabis and asians are the best medi-cal has to offer. I love this Punjabi DR Arora and her staff; could get only $1 out of me ha ha, & made my insurance pay thousands dollars. Even did emergency root canal on me to save my tooth when I couldn't afford it. Definitely doctor to see.</review>

Horrible customer service. Office staff is rude and the phone is never answered. The pediatric dentist on staff is actually great but is only in once a month. We had an apt but he ended up not coming in that month. They told us the would call when they had the date he would be back in and we never heard back.< /Review>

This was my worst experience going to any dentist. I arrived at 4:30 and left at 7:00 waiting and I never got my teeth done</review>

Taking over an hour and a half to see a patient with an appointment is terrible customer service.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I am extremely happy about my experience at Western Dental Office in Fremont. I was recently retired and looking for the most trusted place for my dental needs. Dr. Priya Arora is a great doctor. She went over with me all the dental X-rays and clearly explained to me the treatment I will need. Since then, I got the deep cleaning done as well as extraction of my three teeth. The entire treatment was relatively painless. Now I will be starting at home gum treatment. I was clearly explained what I need to do everyday at home. I also need to get implant done for at least one of my teeth after six months. All my questions were clearly answered. I was explained the complete implant process and the overall timeframe to complete the implant. I felt like very personal attention was given to me.

Also Richie Mistry has done an amazing job as a patient treatment coordinator. She went over me the treatment in detail along with all payment options. After doing some research, I concluded that charges are quite reasonable.

Overall, the office staff including the doctor's assistants (while performing the treatment) are also very good.

It was quite a refreshing experience at a Western Dental Office in Fremont. I am looking forward to complete the rest of treatment.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
After 2years, I finally quit and will move to a different  dentist near by. This is the worst medical management I have ever been. They will try to sell you mouth guard worth $1,800 since day 1 every time I visited they try to sell me that product. It’s more like a sales talk they will try there best to sell it even offer you installments. They made my wife to buy the product told her  it was “A GOOD INVESTMENT” and after a year using it my wife didn’t even see any results from the mouth guard.

Yesterday I had a cleaning appointment with them and they try to sell me the product again, but I refused to buy it then the medical assistant looks upset like she didn’t make her commission for her product and then did a poor service of my teeth cleaning appointment.

WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO GO HERE.</review>

This is a great little market. They have a selection of international food items that are hard to find. At the back of the market, they have an assortment of homemade paletas (popsicles) that are to die for! An all around great place to get ingredients for a great meal.</text>

With shopping at local independent stores in your neighborhood Family Ranch Market suits your everyday needs. They are a Central American mini market that offers a wide variety in Latino foods as well as American foods and items. They have fresh meats and produce. I usually come to refill bottle water here, they have a "Glacier" purified water dispenser that costs 35¢ per gallon. It's a very convenient location and when you need things like ice or cilantro and you don't want to travel to the nearest grocery store which are none that close by this location in Lomita, then this is the spot for those kind of needs. They have a wide variety of sundries and random merchandise you may find interesting or need for everyday purposes.
One of the owners that usually works the registers is really sweet hearted and kind. So expect great service here, she is always polite, courteous, and professional.</Review>

Love the cookies!!!! Also good prices and they have a little bit of everything, so great place to shop and avoid all the big stores when in a hurry or just need a few items. Time saver.< /text>

<review>Nice and clean, secure slip despite traffic from community park.
Private, accessible, and exactly what you'd expect to get for your money here.
Just look out for after dark critters here, as soon as the sun goes down dozens of possums and skunks roam the park and raid the trash and make a huge mess everywhere. I've seen over 15 of them between walking from my car to boat one evening recently.<//review>< pictures>

Well kept Marina with ample parking options for all gates. It's  easy to access from 3rd to Front Street. Seems reasonably priced as well.<//review>

< review>
I have docked my boat at the Sacramento Marina for over 12 years. The overall design of the docks is extremely well done. This includes walkways that are wide, stable, made of concrete and metal with wooden and plastic bumper rails on the sides.  The marina workers are friendly, courteous, helpful and take pride in keeping everything clean, nice and repaired. There are many amenities such as a gas dock, pump-out, Marina office with a bathroom/shower, secured parking at night and a small store.
There is no river current within the Marina and the wind is limited because of the nature of the levies. That makes docking your boat a much easier if you're not having to fight current or wind. The patrons of the Marina have always been nice and friendly and it seems that the occasional rowdy troublemakers are asked to leave.
I've had my boat located at two other local marinas in the Sacramento area and this one is the best by far.
One thing that could be make the experience even better, is that it would be wonderful to have a restaurant and bar at the marina or within walking distance.< /review>

< Review>
We've kept our boat here for five summers now and we love it.  Great staff who are friendly and knowledgeable and covered concrete slips, each with electrical hook ups and a hose bib.  There's also a small store with snacks and boating accessories at the fuel dock.  We also like that it the Marina is in a lagoon off the main river current.< /Review>

<review>This is a very nice marina! Looks to be nearly full! The boat slips are covered and the Marina is clean and well maintained. Security gates to access the marina. There is a fuel pump here and showers for after you're day on the river. There is also a nice boat launch located on the park. Great place for a Marina right off the freeways near all the freeway interchanges...< /review>< Pics>

Sacramento Marina is one of the nicest marinas in Northern California. When there was all that flooding, other marinas closed. Sacramento stayed open and accessible. Some of the nicest folks dock at this marina as well.<//review>

<resp>None</resp><Review>We stopped at the Sacramento Municipal Marina as we were headed downriver from Sac. We were charged an outrageous price to tie up for the night to an uncovered dock (not a slip) with no water and no electricity. We absolutely would have considered turning around and heading back up river to another marina if we weren't so tired.

And still the next morning some grouchy lady leans down from the balcony of the swanky harbor master's office and yells, "Hey! This isn't a public dock! You can't tie up there." Turns out they'd misplaced out paperwork because we'd arrived kind of late. "Oh," she said curtly. Apparently, we shouldn't hold our breath for an apology.

Other than a sense that rules were more important than people, it was nice as far as facilities go. Fuel dock, showers, etc.< /Review>< Pics>

Poor professionalism. Left my car at 9am as they requested. No call to let me know what was going on, so I call at 4:30 bf they closed at5. Rude person indicated he needed it a couple more days to check it out.  I ask" did u at least put it on the rack. It seem to be a simple a/c problem". At that point  he said angrily"Come pick your car up I'm trying to eat lunch" Said the same thing when I got there while he was eating a bag of chips. Took my car promptly to Manteca Ford who fixed the job in 2 hrs I'll never go back to Main Auto Repair again.👎👎👎👎👎< /text>

Did not even get to talk to a mechanic, lady in front was rude and obnoxious. Did not know what she was talking about.. taking my business elsewhere! She definitely needs better costumer service skills and/or training!<//Review>

2004 mini Cooper S brg aka Koopa Troopa... Had been the thorn in my side for months.  Countless repairs to clear code P2096 after the fuel pump went out... And was also replaced.  Some of the repairs were probably overdue so that's ok but still the code would get cleared and reappear!
Ugh.  So much time and energy over this code.
Within one min of the long story I was about to tell... the nice woman at the front had already diagnosed and practically fixed Koopa.
She cleared the code and test drove.  Under five min... Should have come in sooner.
So many thanks!<//Review>

Took my nissan altima here to have them check out the rough idling, they found the problem it was the motor mounts I had another shop replace not that long ago.

<UserId.>113400236363706431241< /UserId.><review>I Met Brent & Angie late 2012 when I started working for a Local Tow Co. in Manteca. Family owned & ran. Community supported Brent has earned more than my business. He's earned my trust & respect. Unfortunately I moved to Stockton & being a Tow Op. Getting my Hondad to him really hasn't been a problem however wish I still lived local

Being lifelong Automotive Industry Worker. NOT many mechanics or shops have earned my trust & respect.

Thank You Brent & Angie. Be seeing you soon. Pretty sure current problem with 2000 Accord is Speed sensor
Check Engine light went out again so no way to get true code from computer until comes on again.< /review>< user_name>

Took my vehicle in for a check engine lite problem. They located and repaired the problem in no time and saved me $400 that the dealer quoted. I saved so much that I had them do a oil change and tire rotation all completed in. 1 day. Family owned and operated and if you are looking for a repair shop THIS IS THE ONE!!. Thank you to Angie and Brett for such personalized service. Keep up the good work. I will definately be returning.</text>

Since it's not in the main residential areas, you dont get homeless people and the drinks are always yummy. Lots of parking as well and friendly staff.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2bd76e0aa8529:0xa5d94ab67ac8f8b2<//gmap_id><UserId.>102852662684846394486</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I have been to this place a few times while in the area to reminisce about Holiday Bowl. Parts of Starbucks still give that friendly Holiday vibe. But I think many of the current customers never had a chance to bowl or eat at Holiday during an era where the community peaked. Diversity among minorities worked well in that era. I felt hostility and looks like WTF are you doing here.</review>

I miss the old staff - they were the best and never messed up my order. The new staff is cool too, but there is always something wrong w/ my order. If I could mobile-order from someplace else I would.<//Text>

this is the cleanest and friendliest Starbucks coffee shop I've ever been to. great service here. the barista's here are very friendly and seem to love their job. great location with plenty of parking and very fast WiFi. if I could rate this location with more than 5 stars I would.</Text>

This is my favorite local Starbucks!!! I come here in the mornings to get coffee and in the afternoons to study and it's the perfect environment. Amazing staff even late at night, had a great debate about polotics with one barista named Brandon and recommend anyone to stop by and strike up a conversation with him!</text>

Hard to find any seats a good deal of the time, but drinks are made well and staff is always quite friendly. Great location too and I have never had any issues finding parking here.< /review>

This USED to be a great place to go. They started getting  a revolving door of new employees within the past 2 years that are nowhere nearly as nice and friendly as the ones that were there for years.

Recently, there has been an explosion of people bringing their pets into the store claiming they are service dogs (they are not service dogs). When a couple of customers pointed out that pets were not allowed, the employees actually called the police to have the customers that complained arrested for wanting these fake service dogs removed!

Another customer got the police called on him for asking for a different size water cup!

Also, the recent remodel of the store made it a cold and uncomfortable environment to sit and have your coffee.</text>

<Review>Mobile orders are rarely ready when you arrive at this location. Placed an order at 7:43 this morning and didn't get it until after 8:15. I ordered 10 minutes out to make sure it was ready. Staff did not communicate well with patrons waiting for mobile orders. Watched a guy start labeling cups, including mine, 10 minutes after I asked about my mobile order. One person making the drinks with 5 others in the cafe.</Review></record></dataset><record>

It's so bad I had to downgrade my review thrice now, the service is, by definition, extraordinarily terrible- as in these people must actively try to suck this bad for the service to be so terrible. Never again.</text>

Service with a smile. While they screw you! I knew it was too good to be true about the accessories being free. I am upset with the fact i was provided no paper work to overview before signing and could not be allowed to deny the product accessories because they were a “bundle” that was included for “free”. At the end they have you sign contract which all makes sense but the ending which consisted of accessories were not allowed to be returned... at this point i should have known I was getting ripped off. Turns out when I walked out I got my emailed receipt stating the taxes and my accessories, a charge of $159, for a charger, screen protector and case totaling 285-289 dollars. In conclusion I will be looking to take these guys to small claims for false advertising and not providing enough information on their “free bundle”. Avoid this location because they will lie to you with a smile on their faces. All they had to do was just be upfront and tell me i would need to pay for these and give me the option to refuse to make it a great experience. Victra, if you’re reading this take a lesson in customer service. Be transparent with your customers in the future to avoid such situations and please don't lie to us and take us for an idiot.</Review>

The manager at this store told me because so many people wanted the new iPhone12 that if I wanted it I'd have to buy it with accessories, as a bundle. That is illegal and called PRICE GOUGING. It was the only store that had one left so I had to go there. They didn't know how to make the switchover from old phone to new phone happen so corporate had to step in and do it on their end yet the girl helping me laughed at me and was passive aggressive. The asst manager urged me to please give them a great review.< /Review>

<review>Jennifer was an excellent sales representative at Verizon. She assisted us quickly, answered all our questions and guided us through the transition from T-Mobile to Verizon. She informed us of the excellent deals Verizon was currently offering. She when above and beyond!

Set appointment and was told to just wait, no time, just told to wait around nearby. Waited for over an hour without ever getting any other messages. Watched for over 30 minutes as only 2 people are being helped and 2 employees are just standing around talking/on their phones. My problem is EXTREMELY simple to fix less than 5 minutes. I am currently still waiting to hear from them, but I've already left and will never go to this location again. Even though it is within a 5 minute walk of my house.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2d1f75824fce3:0xbbf2d4a85754eb05<//gmapID><Date>1609377272568< /Date>< user_id>

<review>This store is the worst for customer service.  I went in recently to ask a question on my mom's new phone and was given NO help.  I walked out feeling really displeased. Today 2/26 @ 730pm, I went in again for some help on installing my new update and the rep said, uninstall and that should work.  Not even try it in front of me or anything.  Then he sat down and was on his phone. I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THIS STORE AGAIN</review></record></dataset><record>

Good service and fair pricing. Customer reps spent time needed to go over the plans' details. All in all a very good experience.< /text>

Dishonest service! Check your receipt before you leave.  Was offered phone protection plan multiple times by Blanca and told her multiple times I was not interested.  I didn't realize she had charged me until I saw my bill a month later. This is not the first time I've had unwanted add ons without my knowledge</Review>

Came in to transfer data to my new phone. The manager, Sonny, tried to convince me to add the Multi-device Insurance. I said not interested. Couple of days later i look at my Next Bill and that dude switched my regular $6.75 insurance to the Muti-device Insurance!
i go back to the store and the guy denies he made any changes. come on,  the change was made on that date! And this is the manager ok!
Always check your account after visiting this store...< /Review>

First time in a Verizon and it was not busy. The personal there was able to answer what I was asking and waited for me to finish my sentence before speaking, and even helped fix with a problem on my phone.< /Review>

We walked in and a man, who we didn't even know was the manager said someone would help us. A woman came and was very rude and had an attitude, and was no help at all. We went in to ask a question about the bill and open 2 new phone lines but she was not a pleasant person to deal with. We requested someone else and she rolled her eyes and walked away, we told her she didn't have to have attitude and she shouted, "I don't have an attitude!". I asked for the manager and she pointed at him while walking away and said, "He's right there." He just sat on his phone and didn't acknowledge the situation.sit one came to help us so we walked out. We're never going there again.< /text>

These people are deceiving and misinformed.  I am so upset that they took my new Samsung Edge 7 promising to pay off my old contract, gave me the instructions and then denied they told me that.   The managers are the ones who should be held accountable.   I am still trying to get my issue resolved.  I will call the corporate office.  I have spent over 8 hours on the phone in total since December 17th!  Very upset over the unfair business practices at that store!!!!< /Review>

<text>Extremely unsatisfied with the help from Maximiliano, with the issues concerning the new Note 7's he said I couldn't replace my phone for a different one until the new Note 7's came out. He was trying to get me to  re-upgrade to another phone and I would be stuck with it and not get the replacement Note 7 when they came out. I called customer service and they said he was wrong. I was to get a new Samsung phone until the new Note'7's came out like I had explained. I called to explain that to him and he kept cutting me off and hung up on me!! Customer service sent me to Whittier's store and they helped me without question since they knew the rules regarding the exchange. This store has awful and apparently Max is the store manager. Very bad misinformed store with bad management. Don't go here, the Whittier store is much better!< /text>< gmap_id>

But when I have a malfunctioning device they just look the other way. The manager has the same mad and annoyed face everytime I visit the store. Plus the manager is the one who is checking in people for their necessities! It is supposed to be the other associates responsibility! Something needs to change at the VZW....

Nice store. Only problem is they sell only Huskies and KTM and a couple Suzuki's. So the selection isn't too big.</Text>

Great staff. Had to take my bike in for service. These guys are very knowledgeable and super courteous. I would highly recommend this shop or if you are looking to buy a bike. If they don't have what you're looking for they can always get it. Just ask.< /Text>

These guys are great. If your in the market for a nice bike Fators is your stop. I brought my Husqvarna in after 1000 miles and Cory did a quick inspection and tightened her up for me no problem. Happy with my purchase and the customer service.<//Text>

In my years dealing with Fators Motorcycle Sales & Service, I have never been disappointed. The makes & models of bikes in stock is impressive. Craig sets the tone of effort and honesty. His and all the employees advice is invaluable. Justin, Joe and Kevin are top rated mechanics. The parts department people are fast and will find exactly what you need. Corey is always good for a laugh.<//review>

Had my Vstrom serviced and some parts put on. It wasn't cheap, but they did a good job and I really liked the communication with the service department. I will be returning for my parts and service needs. This was the first time using Fator's, as this is the first Suzuki I've owned. They have earned my business.<//Review>

I purchased a new KTM from Fator’s at an excellent price 1year ago. I was very happy with how everything went. I am even more impressed with their customer service a year later. My rear brake stopped working so I asked them about it. They told me to bring it in so they could look at it. 1 hour later I received a call saying they were all finished and for no charge. Very happy with the entire company. Would highly recommend Fator’s and KTM.</Text>

Just drove up from the bay area and bought a new 2017 Husqvarna TC250.  I have purchased countless bikes over the years and my experience at Fator's is hands down the best i have ever had.  This family owned business offers a level of professionalism, knowledge, experience and courtesy that is second to none.  I will continue to make the drive north to do business with this shop!</text>

Local owned.  Craig and his family operate a great shop.  The mechanics in the garage do excellent work.  Every time I go to Fators, the staff is always smiling and friendly no matter what time of day.  Convenient location in the center of Redding with plenty of parking.< /review>

Been bringing my bikes to these guys for about 2 years.  It is worth noting they are above average and they have gotten the job done right every time.  Kudos. Also if you like dirt bikes stop by and take a look at their inventory- so many cool bikes, it is almost as much fun as checking out the factory bikes at the Hangtown MX AMA motocross.  Seriously the have allot of cool bikes there...<//Text>

<review>Took my bike in for the first oil change and when I got it back I noticed it had about a 13 inch scratch below the tank. Definitely happened while being worked on in the shop, avoid this place getting anywhere near your bike because they do not treat your property with respect.< /review><Date>1502063355199< /Date><rating>1< /rating></record>

Just purchased my 6th motorcycle from Fator's this past week and can't thank them enough for the honest, fair, and friendly service we have received from the Fator family all of these years. Looking forward to doing business for many more to come!</Text>

<text>Can't say enough about these guys.  I had a rented BMW and the rear tire was soon toast, the agency sent me to them for a replacement.  20 miles out the tire went flat, I called them and they sent an employee out with one of the service guys personal truck to pick me up!!!!!  Tire was replaced pronto and I was on my way!  Great guys, family owned and operated.   Can't thank them enough!<//text><gmap_id>0x54d2ecb969b41a45:0x56e3bcad63a4783b<//gmap_id>< response>

The quads are superior; however, I took my quad in for its new tune and oil change (it was running fine). Unfortunately my new quad came back backfiring when cold and a new oil leak. I checked the oil filter and found it had not been changed. I did not take the quad back for fear worse results would be incurred :-(! They did not get a chance to "make it good" because the head mechanic gave me a very uneasy feeling. I have never been back and will never go back.< /review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>We took in our scooter after the oil filter came off and it stopped running and made a funny noise. Drove 2 hours to this shop to drop it off, after explaining exactly what happened. First off they took 3 days because they were so convince they may need to replace the whole engine without even looking at it. After finding out that an engine was thousands of dollars they got the ok to take it apart and look at it. Basically they changed the battery, changed the oil but Not the filter and checked the compression. After coming back 2 hours to pick it up the guy tells us it's smoking and the o rings probably are damage so it's using oil. They never took the engine apart and return it to us with issues that we took it to the professionals to fix. 250 bucks later for nothing and a big waste of time, we have a not so fixed scooter and will NOT be back!<//Text>< Rate>

I've purchased 2 Quads from Fators and their Sales philosophy was much better than any other dealer within 100 miles.  I'm talking all dealers, ie: Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki, etc, etc.
After laying out the criteria I wanted in a quad, ie: 4 Stroke, Automatic, 4WD, Low Range, etc, the other dealers told me everything from:  "You don't need 4WD, to "With a honda, you don't need low range".
When I informed the Fators salesman what I wanted, he simply showed me the quads that met that criteria and let the quad sell itself.
No BS about other manufacturers, no sales pitch, no pressure.
Excellent Salesmanship!!
As far as service goes, I recently brought my Suzuki Vinson 500 to them for a carburetor issue.  The mechanics, Joe & Duston were very courteous and listened to everything I had to say regarding what led up to the problem.  They had the problem diagnosed in moments and immediately started to work on it.  4 hours later I was driving off with my quad running as well as it ever had.  They overhauled the carburetor and even installed a prefilter in the fuel line to prevent future issues.  They also performed numerous checks and routine maintenance, all at a very reasonable price. The friendly and personable attitude of the Owner and the Mechanics were refreshing and I left a very happy customer.
Great Job Guys!!   Thank You!<//Text>

This Raley's is the only raley's in town to make fresh Sushi and it's really good! I like this Raley's more than the one off Notre Dame Blvd. I drive further just because I prefer the Raley's on East Ave. This store has a better Deli selection and all over better vibe😊< /text>

Look. I go here often. WAY too often. It has its pros and cons. Overall though, it's deli area serves some really awful chicken and they can't seem to keep anything stocked. I haven't been able to buy heavy cream since mid-November.</Review>

It's nice but pricey. I wasn't all that impressed with their carrot cake. I prefer dense cake with actual cream cheese frosting.</text>

I visit almost daily.  From Alma, Dawn, Dennis, and most recently Stacy and Mason, nothing but great, friendly service.  I live near and have recently relocated for work from the Midwest.  Nice to have a great store to shop at blocks away.< /Text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Raleys is on our grocery store rotation but we don't go regularly. This winter they had an excellent selection of firewood and kindling. Prices are higher than WinCo, safeway, and trader joe's to name a few but it's no whole foods or sprouts. Would like to see more plant-based food options.  Good service, entering and exiting from East Ave is not great. Easier to come and go from the hidden entrance off Esplanade, near the bowling alley.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>I love this Raleys. Their manger Greg provides the best customer service as well as the other employees. They courteous, very helpful, and are willing to place the customer first.  The deli employees will go out of their way to figure out an answer to a question and the checkers are quick, friendly in a way that let you know they are actually paying attention to you when you are talking. The produce department always looks clean, organized and full of fresh everything. Over all A+!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<review>I really enjoyed this Raley's quality and freshness of everything they sell. This is like a Super selection Raley's store. Unique to other Raley's stores it has an exceptional deli as well as a place to sit and enjoy deli hot meals. I can also find specialty teas and coffees that I didnt think anyone sold anymore in a vast beverage department. At this impeticular store I can shop at any buget I find myself in. But I have to say that I felt as though the staff were stuck up, and judgemental that I had to count a few dimes and nickles to pay for something. Just be sure to play the part and you will have a wonderful shopping experience.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Love this store, the pharmacy is always friendly and get what we need ready for us. Love their bakery as they have lots of goodies. Some times I get a fancy coffee and a pastry which makes my morning. Can always find d so.ethi g to try there in the isles as they stock a nice assortment of items. Always love checking out their seasonal items they get in. Just simply a fun place to shop. Their produce always looks so nice too!< /Review>

Clean store, very nice and polite employees.  The store seems to have wider isles or at least they feel that way.  Produce selection is the best around unless you buy farm direct.  The meats are exceptional.</review>

I find that Raley's has items that I can't find anywhere else such as Melt which is a butter alternative and organic.  It's healthy and it tastes great.  It's such a large store that it doesn't feel crowded to me even if there is a lot of people shopping at one time.  You often can find unusual items throughout the store.  Also the wait at the checkout is usually short.  Raley's on East has a TriCounties bank inside that's convenient.<//text>

<review>Love Raleys so much. This was my first time at THIS specific Raleys (while traveling) and loved the subtle differences than i am used to. I absolutely loved the architecture, with entrances and exits on either side of the front of the building, instead of walking straight in through the front. Very clean store. Delicous fresh foods, and friendly staff.</review><gmapID>0x8082d883fdc507a5:0x7ab79af4bb43fb0<//gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Great produce (+organic), meat, bakery and deli. Decent wine and beer selections. Groceries are a bit more expensive here but check out fresh made deli sandwiches. Nice employees and TriCo Bank inside.<//review>

Customer service seems to be going downhill they encourage you to use the self checkout by not having anybody up front to check you out. And I've always wondered why they put the red hand baskets stop by the self-checkout behind the counter that's so lame< /Text>

I always enjoy shoping at Raley's. This location is very clean and I always get great customer service. I mainly like getting my meat and vegetables here. I know they're fresh and I won't end up finding any nasty surprises. I will typically do the rest of my shopping at a discount grocery store.</Text>

Clean, great service, nice hot food bar, but the chicken strips wont taste the same all the time, fresh produce!.   The only bad thing is that 80% of the time they have few cashiers.< /Review>

<Text>I go here almost exclusively for my weekly produce and the artisanal sourdough French bread- which is amazing by the way. The staff are always friendly and very helpful. And at first glance it seems that it might be more expensive than the Safeway on Nord, but I've found that the quality is better and oftentimes it is significantly cheaper for the essentials.<//Text><rating>5</rating><time>1555827730950</time>< userid>

<text>Very clean, always well stocked. Employees exceptionally friendly and helpful. It's especially nice since the store-wide remodel. The only negative is, I personally don't care for all the liquors being moved to the front of the store, but that's just me. The deli sandwiches are excellent and the new salad bar, hot foods bar is always fresh and never dull choices. The crispy chicken strips are a favorite at our house.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This store has the best deals on meat and plenty to choose from. It also has a great selection of fresh vegetables and everything you need. The employees are generally friendly plus Raleys offers online shopping with pickup. They will bring your order out to your car. Just pre schedule a time and pay at the car if you like with your credit card.</text>

Large Grocery store with many options. They have a bakery, small deli.area. they have food from many different areas of the world. I enjoy there talenti gelato selection. They also carry many different kinds of dairy free. Ice cream choices. Highly recommend for more upscale ingredients without having to drive to far out of your way. Be warned though. With nice ingredients comes a higher price point<//Text>

I asked the cashier what company Raley's was affiliated with and he told me they were family owned under their own Raleys brand. The store is impressive.</Text>

It literally took me 2 hours to get WIC here... First only the Raleys brand wic items were marked and for eggs werent marked.... They had items marked WIC that ended up not being wic approved the juices had low selection... They had NO canned fruit or applesauces or vegies marked wic for fruits or veggies... With $9 just for five bananas and 1 lb of grapes! And even the grapes were ringing upnon wic...then the cashier was slow as heck...not nice when you have babys waiting on u<//Text>
