<text>bought seven grams of concentrate, got home to find out it's all expired. wasn't offered any compensation at all for being sold expired product; for driving back and wasting time. they were trying to play me like a simp by telling me they couldn't give me my money back and I had to use the money on something in store. why would I buy something else here after getting sold a bunch of expired concentrate and not even getting any compensation thats what you call terrible customer service. place is a waste of time. Also budtenders have zero knowledge about their products. They still think that high thc % means anything and is all they will recommend if you ask.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>They were very helpful and knowledgeable. There was a nice selection to suit everyone's needs. I chose the Procana 15mg THC softgels 20 count. It's the first time I've tried this product and I'm hoping it will be enough to take the edge off my chronic pain. I used to smoke heavily, but quit about 6 months ago. I have a very low tolerance now and think these were a good place to start. Who knows, maybe next time I'll upgrade to the 50mg...

Anyways, the gentleman that helped me was super cool and made sure to open the doors for me as I'm in a wheelchair. It was easy to find, easy parking and they do both recreational and medicinal. No paperwork, Just show you ID and your good to go.

Glad to have found it! Thank you for the great and super easy experience. I'll definitely be back!</Review><name>Stephani Ann García< /name>< Rating>

Terrible customer service. The second you walk in you are greeted by a representative that would rather be getting a root canal than talk to you. The people inside the product room are no different, I was trying to get a recommendation on some dank carts and the person was lethargic the whole time. The selection is not very large, the prices are similar to other places but i'm not bothering coming back NO WAY.</text>

Hazel is The Shiz-nit!!! They have all the top of the line old school flowers, and they're all real,no b.s., they got heart,too. But bar none,at least for me, they have multiple of multiples of wax,kief,infused top shelf prerolls,wow do they help with my social anxiety and my PTSD.< /Review>

Update: They are OPEN again. "Recreational and Medical. They follow the rules professionally. Card and cash now! The staff is very helpful and will answer all your questions until ready to purchase. Limited vape and disposable selection. They have high THC drinks. You can mix or drink straight....very good. 5 flavors. Comes in a small box. No cosmetics and creams. All the rest of this review is from the Good ol days: "Good tinctures. All their flower strains are priced the same at $35 for an 1/8. That's $10 to $20 less than anywhere else for an 1/8. They are also the only place around that you can find 210 mg THC drinks! And 500mg concentrate. And $5 joints! (3 for $10) Always stock Cannibutter. RDC on Reseda is awesome too, but we come here for the bud and drinks."</Text>

< Review>
Horrible clinic. I just recently moved from Portland to Los Angeles a few months ago, and promptly got my CA medical card. A little while after I got my CA license and I've since been using my printed paperwork from the DMV along with my US Passport for access to clinics until my license comes in the mail. Today I went into this dispensary and was turned down for the lack of a CA ID, despite having my temporary paperwork from the DMV with my license number (still valid for another two months) and my US Passport. If it's good enough for the cops on the road it should be good enough for you, or do you not understand that temporary paperwork and a passport is valid ID until the laminated card arrives? Either way, I wasn't allowed entry and I sure as hell won't be trying again. There are far better and friendlier dispensaries to go to.< /Review>

<Review>Does anyone know if these guys are licensed? I like the fact that they aren't charging tax but I got some weird vibes inside. Their staff was a bit rude trying to rush me through the purchase process and I hadn't really settled on the strain of indi to get. I def won't be going back.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Public radio/television at its very best--that's KQED. They were my daily commuting companion and lunch break company for years and years. Their original programming is outstanding. Since moving out of state, I am sadly missing all the local KQED radio hosts and their shows. I now find myself tuning in via the internet. My local public radio now is good... however, KQED is simply outstanding. I now realize how spoiled I was for many years. Keep up the great work, KQED!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1595014186384<//Time><review>For a "Public" station, I'm curious about their balance sheet. How much does say "Check, Please" cost to produce and how much does KQED charge other public stations nationwide for airing it? How many programs has KQED produced, are they popular productions nationwide and worldwide, and generally is KQED "very productive" or "relatively low productive"? What's the salary pay ranges for jobs at KQED? The original "Newsroom" was a fantastic roundtable of good and great reporters discussing politicians and issues, but it was cancelled. Maybe by pressure from big Corp.

KQED has merged with a San Mateo "public" station and a San Jose "public" station, so how is that loss of diversity in Our "public" interest?
Years ago I read KQED own "history" which was mostly buying a long series of many tv stations and moving often, so how did that benefit us, the "public"?
Was that an honest and accurate KQED "history"? Doubtful. Last year KQED had only 1 woman in "Audience Services"! Yes, just one. Shameful.

We now have to listen and watch  biz Commercials, Endowment Commercials, and constant Begging for donations. Decades back Joan Baez often appeared to help raise money. And Julia Child.  Yes, most of Commercial tv is deplorable. The old reruns and mean tv shows! Can KQED take every 3rd month off this constant begging? Please.
How well does KQED spend this "public" and private money? Any trustworthy 3rd party raters?
How good is KQED's boss and past bosses?  What all are they hiding and why?

Many people leave their Estate fortunes to KQED, a large tv and radio station, instead of Save the Bay or Public Schools generally to bring back Arts, Music electives, and Cursive education to California. What about childhood hunger in the BayArea and California? And general environmental clean up-public health? Housing, not slumlord Tenderloin rents!, for the Mentally ill kicked onto the streets from Governor closed South Bay Agnews and closed North Bay Sonoma Mental? Is that treatment of people such a low priority for such a Rich,highly paid and expensive area as the Bay Area? California is the 5th biggest economy in the World! It is shocking and shameful, don't you think?
Is KQED really the most important charity to You, the "public" in the Bay Area and California? We spoil this station business and neglect so many other State "public" unfunded unregulated and ignored needs.

Just curious.
There is so much we don't know about KQED.
What does "public" really mean to KQED?
What are KQED's goals and performance?
For such a "public" private business there seems to be a lot of usual antisocial business secrecy.
Does KQED dream?

The ch9-1 to ch9-4 programs are the same as those on ch54-1 to ch54-4. How about  Adult programming on the 4 ch9s and Children programming on the 4 ch54s? This duplication seems such a waste, also of the FREE Sutro tower tv signals for the Bay Area.

June2020, since Sutro Tower FCC- regs by law! FREE HD signals to 8 million people in the Bay Area does not have a Channel Guide for those of us who no longer want to pay $80/mo to Comcast- infinity for worse D and lousy monopoly service, Could KQED lead for a change in "public" service and give channel guides between shows, on the hour, and maybe half hour, for each channel for the day remaining, maybe scrolled or scrollable, if the software engineers are not too busy? Every channel on TV could do this instead of relying on paid TV's one big all inclusive tv channel guide. This might be an improvement, real progress in a tiny small baby step. Maybe.</review>< gmapID>

Have always loved KQED.  From when our kids were little we loved the kids shows, the nature shows, the News Hour.  Now I follow the food shows (so much more authentic than other stations), still the nature shows, science, and just recently discovered Nightly Business Report (NBR).  It has been completely revamped and is just awesome.  It is a great summary of the gyrations of the financial day with thoughtful commentary from some CNBC pros.  Highly recommend it!!!!</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I'm giving KQED 1 * in general PBS has a lot of nerve putting on Martha Stewart who had a felony conviction for insider trading. I'm tired of a judicial system with preferential treatment. Also Sesame Street's Elmo played by Kevin Clash was found guilty in court of luring teenage boys across state line in a limo for sexual purposes. Also all the meat on cooking shows is clearly insensitive to those who love animals and would never hurt them to eat a meal. There ought to be diversity in programming aside from Qwen Eiffel and Maria and Gordon from Sesame Street</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Stop stating that Clinton needs only 71 delegates to clinch the Dem. Nomination. It is not true!  Super Delegates do not vote until July 25th, and many things can happen before then - like Clinton being indicted.

The pro-Clinton bias of NPR and PBS during this election has been obvious and disturbing, and I will never donate again.</review>

The rep that helped me, put a new sim into the phone, but disconnected my sim and linked it to my son’s phone. So I was left with a useless device. After finding out I was without service, all the way across town! I had to go back, ask for the rep to fix it. Lucky, I got the same rep. He gave a new SIM card for my sons phone, put the one in my sons phone in my phone. No apology or anything. Instead try to blame me. Saying I gave him the wrong number. I don’t know what he was thinking. I have 5 lines. Why would I want one of the lines to not have service? I pay for 5 lines. Anyways. After that fiasco, my sons phone still doesn’t work. Not to mention, this is after numerous calls to att because my bill is never right. Theres added charges I never consented for.

< Review>
My family has been loyal customers with AT&T since they were Cingular. My mother was in this store waiting in line after a long day at work to pay her bill. While she was waiting to be helped another person came in and asked for a rep because she mentioned she wanted to activate 4 lines. She was instantly helped by the manager at the time who referred her to another rep to activate lines. The manager at the time is Erica. This behavior just shows that customers DO NOT matter unless you’re giving them a reason to help i.e activating,upgrading,adding a line. Unacceptable coming from a store we’ve been going to for a long time. Stay AWAY from this store because they DO NOT CARE about you at all. Sooner or later we will take our business somewhere else because clearly the culture the manager has set in the store is all wrong. YOU ARE JUST a number to these guys and will only care about you when you’re giving them sales. After that you’ll be treated like dirt.<//Review>

I bought a att screen protector brand from this store for my iPhone 12 pro max and the screen has lint and smeer and is defective I talked to the manager about refund and he gave a bad attitude and said there was nothing wrong about the screen protector so he refuse to get refund but offer another one. I bought two from the same store and it had the same problem but the manager still refuse after having a conversation he asked us to leave or he will call the cops on us. This is a bad place and bad costumer service< /text>

When I called before going in, I wanted to know the process because of the whole covid. I spoke with Albert. He was informative and I felt I wasn’t rushed with every question I had and he was very informative. So I came in a couple days later and melizza helped me. She got me in right away and we started the update process. She had great customer service and answered every question I had along with finding out billing info for me. She was professional and quick.<//review>

<review>I can appreciate great customer service. When there is a discrepancy,  I don't want to be told what I want to hear...I'd much rather have action. It's been a refreshing experience doing my AT&T business at this location. No candy "coded" responses...just action and/or useful information that actually solves the problem.
The plus side is, each of these Associates have been very pleasantly respectful, as well.
Thank you! 🙂</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80945f2c95b25693:0x5da6599e245873e9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Haven’t a problem with this store till now, their representative failed to give me the right information about the release date on the iPhone 11, and failed to inform me about the 14 day exchange policy  when I purchases my phone! There exchange and return polices should ALWAYS be informed to customers even if it’s “on the receipt” like one of the representatives told me. I wouldn’t be upset if he would of at least told me the correct release date and the exchanged policy they have. I would have definitely went in before the14 day exchange policy.

Very disappointed on how they handled their mistake!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80945f2c95b25693:0x5da6599e245873e9<//Gmap_id><user>116235283690332650708< /user></record></dataset><record>

Average service quality, and there can be long waits depending on day and time. The person who helped me was barely interested in doing so and did only the bare minimum to help. My issue was more technical than most of the problems they probably face because I'm more technically literate and capable than most of the employees. I'm sure they would do just fine if you have any generic issues with any AT&T branded phone.< /Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><pics>None</pics><review>They say that they're unable to process reversal fees or give back credit so they make you call AT&T customer service.. when I called, the AT&T customer service representative on the phone told me they have the access to do that but have the customers call all the time. So idk if it's because the rep at the AT&T store wanted to not do as much work, or whatever but aside from that, customer service varies as usual<//review>< time>

Love buying my parts from here.
They arrive fast and in perfect condition.
I'll continue to purchase parts from yotamasters.
My only wish is that they had a shop in nor cal. Cuz these guys are awesome.< /Review>

<Review>Nice local business got some rock sliders from them it was  fast and easy. Due to Covid-19 no one was allowed to enter in the building. Which was nice the transaction was just done at the entrance of the door but no one inside was wearing a mask so there's that too. The transaction took less then a minute so not a big deal.  I'll be back to support them thou< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Great people to deal with, ordered some revolution regear kits for my pickup and had a great experience with the shop! Great service and called me to let me know when they were short a setup kit from revolution and sent me a Nitro gear install kit in it's place. The Nitro kit had some issues but none of that is on the shop here! Had an awesome experience with the company and will continue to use them for a parts source and recommend them to friends!<//text>

<review>Austin was super helpful! All of my transactions online were easy so I reached out on some issues I was having with my 89 Toyota pickup(not related to yotamasters). He went out of his way to get the needed parts, call me back, and let me know a plan of action. Love supporting a good business.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x14e19f36dc395749:0xd860865200fa942d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I buy from yotamasters because Erick is the man when you need technical info on the parts you purchased from him. He has walked me through my projects as if he were with me looking at them. He is my first stop shopping for all my toyota projects. Highly recommend.
Other companies sell parts but do not have tech support.  Thanks again Erick , Andy< /Text>

<review>Great group here !!!  Courteous and prompt. I ordered a part that they don’t stock that usually gets drop shipped from somewhere else and I still got it in less than a week. Unlike LCE engineering whose customer service sucks.  Yota Masters   Came in much cheaper than low range off-road. 🤘🏻Rock on yotamasters!!<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x14e19f36dc395749:0xd860865200fa942d< /gmapID></record>

I've been taking my 1992 80-Series Toyota Land Cruiser to them since discovering their quality service shop back in 2008/9! I DRIVE ALL THE WAY FROM COSTA MESA TO HAVE THEM WORK ON MY TRUCK PASSING ALL KINDS OF TOYOTA SERVICE SHOPS! Yes, they are that good!</text>

It's ok but pricey. The dogs are amazing but the lemonade, while delicious, was filled to the brim with ice and there was barely any juice. Might come back for the dogs but come on you're hot dog on a stick, the prices should be cheaper.</review>

Not good that they only have 1 person working here on a busy Saturday afternoon. Whoever runs this business doesn’t know what they are doing. Waited 30 min for a cheese stick. Love hotdog on a stick but I will not come back here not worth the 30 minute wait for one cheese stick</text>

I find it unacceptable that they do not serve corndogs a half an hour before close. I've worked food for years and to stop serving one of the few menu items you have so early is a joke.</text>

<Review>Everybody loves a weiner every now and again... The daughter wont eat a whole lot of food outside of the house so we are aleays excited when she does. She ate a corn dog and we didnt have a hangry little toddler to deal with. The cashier was super nice and that made the experience even better.< /Review><Date>1525042763764<//Date><Rate>4</Rate><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

They did a great job on my son today... he is under two and they did his hair when he wouldn’t wear a mask (sports clips turned us away for no mask) my son hasn’t had a haircut in months and he freaked out and screamed and the girl we had was very patient and friendly and did a really good job even with my son kicking and screaming. I can’t thank her enough!!<//Review>

Good time! Excellent haircut and Vern is the best. Lots of great stylists and a pretty good deal for the experience. Suggest giving it a shot for your next hair cut!<//text>

< Review>
I went here this morning with my two year old son. There were three people working, an older gentlemen, a girl with purple hair and another lady. Not one person greeted me but I figured they were just busy. I signed in, sat down and waited. 35 minutes pass, one of the girls came over and spoke to the two other patrons waiting and still never acknowledged my presence.. I’m really not even sure why! I brought my son here because I thought he would like to get his haircut in the little race car seat they have.<//Review>

If you want a simple fade or haircut, it's a good place, but DO NOT GO if you want a line-up or parting line. Their lines are crooked AF!! But they do a good job on kids though, I'll give them that.< /Text>

This is the first place that I have been able to take my son who has autism and he didn't freak out. The only bad experience I've had with them is when I sent someone else with my son and his hair got cut too short. BUT it's only hair!!!!!</Review>

She messed up horrible she made it look like my son a receding hair line. The lines were so crooked on both sides. And oh not to mention she made him have a bald spot.

<text>My daughter and I are both handicapped. The staff is always so helpful. They have truly been a blessing for us. Helping get the recycling out of our van at times for us so we can sort it into the barrels. The guys are always courteous  and friendly. The property is kept clean. We started  going there after another recycling center took advantage of us and refused to pay us because we had trouble sorting our recycling due to our limited mobility. I recommend them often.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>The employees have always been nice to both my wife and I when we make our monthly visit to recycle the aluminum cans and plastics we've accumulated. We go to this recycling center because the staff are polite and professional, it seems to be the cleanest out of all the different spots we have here in Turlock and we've come to realize that we always get a few bucks more here than we'd get going elsewhere. Go Green or go home!< /review>< user>

They often close early. You can't trust that they will be open according to the hours they have stated. Disappointing.<//Text>

< review>
I’ve come here several times and all the times I come out with $15. I’ve brought them a ton of stuff. I usually go to another one in Dos Palos and i told the guy about it. I took a screen shot of it and showed it to him. He did the math and said it was all wrong, that I should have gotten more than $15. I’ve stopped going there cause it’s a waste of time and it’s more money for them.< /review>

The guys that work here are very helpful. They have even come to me to help out without me needing to ask. They even gave my mom (a senior citizen) a coupon like twice. I really appreciate them, and they are super nice guys. Since they opened, this is the only recycling place we go to.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Horrible, I got ripped off. I had 4 30 gal trash bags of plastic bottles all type 1 and crv. Walked out with 29$. I wasn't going to argue or even waste my time. Just rather leave my comment here for everyone to see. Drive to a real recycle center in Turlock off West main and walnut or even Modesto recycling off 9th st. I've easily walked out with 60$+ with my 4 30 gal trash bags many many times at those two locations. This will be my first and last at this unfortunate establishment. Peace be with you.< /review>< Time>

Fast and efficient, even when it gets extra busy - which it does on some afternoons. Good prices on recyclables, especially anything with CRV, but they do take some non CRV items, too. I'd suggest pre-sorting everything, and make sure all bottles and cans are drained - don't want any sticky leaks! Employees are friendly and helpful.< /Review>

Thank you Javier I called early in the morning and he answered and was able to help me very quickly money is low in these trying times but  he was professional and found me the lowest rates and the insurance that was right for me. I would most definitely recommend him to everyone or AIM as a whole wonderful place<//review>

<text>I absolutely love this company. I initially brought my sister in and she had Daisy as her agent and she made sure she did all she could for my sister. I referred my father in law and finally today I came in and was helped by Melinda. She was absolutely amazing making sure she got me the best price with the most coverage on my 3 vehicles. She is patient and very professional. I'm definitely going to continue to recommend this company.< /text>< Pictures>

I had the best experience today getting insurance and paying for my registration with Malinda. She helped me and my sister purchase insurance and she was very helpful friendly and very patient! I will definitely continue to refer Aims insurance to my friends and family. THANK YOU MALINDA!</Review>

I have been with this company since 2015 and I absolutely love them! Daisy is always super friendly with me on the phone, always helps me find different insurances efficiently, knows what she’s doing, is knowledgeable, and always brings a smile to my face. I’m so happy I found this company and going to stay with them for as long as I can. I definitely would recommend this company to anyone. Thank you Aims insurance:)<//Review>

<Review>Coincidently the lady that helped me acquire this great priced insurance was also named Daisy. The process was so simple and fast. She was able to give me a quote lower than most insurance companies would have charged me. Very friendly atmosphere and yet they are quite professional with their work😊 Definitely would recommend trying this place out🖒< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1558742342053, 'text': 'Thank you Daisy for leaving us such a wonderful review.

Aims Insurance Agents are a part of my family. They demonstrate the Biblical definition of love which is"to care about the well being of others". Their service is well beyond my expectations, and simply put care. I have found the home for my insurance needs and recommend any reader's of this review to join this family. You will be glad you did.< /text>

There isn't a better Party On Rentals company for the South Bay area than Tlapazola Party Rentals. They are quick, efficient, and friendly. Making my order was a breeze, Aleyda made it so easy. The set up crew were on time and thorough. It made our party a huge success! NOTE: Be sure to tip the guys that do the set up! they go above and beyond it making sure your set up is done quickly and efficiently!< /review>

Got a small Spiderman bouncy house and my kid loved it! Super easy to book! There were a lot of options, fairly cheap, and it was delivered on time! I also love that I didn't have to do any labor myself, as it was delivered, set up, and removed by their team.</text>

I hosted a BBQ for my company and we used PartyOn! Rentals for tables, chairs, tents, a boucny house and a snow cone machine. I am SO glad I went with this company. Their prices are very reasonable, they came on time and set everything up for us, and they were right on time for breakdown. We had a wonderful BBQ and I was so thanksful for all of the rentals we had. I will definitely use them again!< /review>

Fantastic experience with this company!! Boy was that easy. And inexpensive. They came on time, blew up the bouncy house, secured it, and came back after the party was over, took it down and left. It cost—wait for it—$99 out the door. For an entire day of a bouncy house which was a hit at our 5 yr old’s birthday. I will gladly rent from them every single time.

Oh and I should mention, given the size constraints and slight incline at one of the locations we were considering for the bouncy house, they promptly assisted me, had me email a few pics, and changed the bouncy house conveniently to one that would fit in my backyard THE DAY BEFORE the party. With less than 24 hrs notice. Just great customer service. 👍🏼< /review>

Delivery was prompt and everyone I spoke with was very professional. I would book through Party On Rentals again. However I didn't like that I couldn't confirm before the week of my sons party, I thought if the bouncer I ordered wasn't going to be available it wouldn't give me much time to try to book from another rental company since my son wanted a car theme birthday if I could only confirm the week of his birthday but everything worked out great. The bouncer I ordered was available and delivered on time and picked up on time. Thank you Party On for making my sons birthday special.< /Text>

<text>It was my son's 5th Birthday Celebration this past weekend. I was a lot nervous about putting the whole thing together as it was going to be the very 1st big celebration I was hosting since my husband / my son's dad passed away 2 years ago, to the exact day today. I wanted to celebrate our son / his only son BIG for this birthday. He deserved it / we deserved it. It's been quite difficult moving on since losing his father. But, once the invitations went out I knew there was no way of turning back. So, because I went with a "Splash-Bash" theme, I booked the Lil' Wave Splash Water Slide & other items from Party On.  It was all worth it, just to see smiles on all the kids / guests' faces when they seen it & played made me glad I chose to do this. I chose to rent the items overnight and I was so glad I did. I felt like a kid again when I decided to try out the water slide myself the day after before they came to pick it up. And, I absolutely, loved it - I needed that! Party On exceeded my expectations, they made this celebration easier to get through and just have a great time. I'm so pleased with their pricing, booking / phone service, on-time delivery, products, their drop-off & pick-up personnel, all the way through to pick-up.  I would definitely, definitely recommend Party On to anyone who's in need of a rental recommendation. I would definitely continue to call them for all my party/celebration rental needs. Thank you, thank you, for your awesome service!</text></record></dataset><record>

What kind of BS is this? Is this place being run out of a garage or something ?

This is the first time I have used "Party On" and it will definitely not be my last. They were very professional, friendly and prompt with delivery & pick-up. The price I was given was extremely fair & quite reasonable compared to many other companies. I have no hesitation in recommending  them for anyone needing party rentals.< /Text>

<time>1463538481422<//time><rate>1</rate><text>Very bad experience with this company's delivery man on Saturday 5/14. 1st he was late and didn't have the courtesy to call. I had to call him 3 different times. Finally arrived and then we he picked up the jumper he was very rude and had an attitude. My nephew forgot his sweater in the jumper and he didn't let him go back in to retrieve it. I called the office on Monday to complain and the lady that took my call advised she would call me back on Monday with an update and today is Tuesday and I haven't heard from her or the company. Will never rent from them again. Very poor customer service. Not worth having to deal with a company with such bad service. Don't waste your money and time with them. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!! Gave them a 1 star because I had to otherwise it wouldn't let me write my review but they are for sure a ZERO Star company.< /text>< pics>

I asked to pay double for them to serve 10 miles outside of their service area and the lady had a nasty attitude and talked to me like I was inconveniencing her by asking. I think everyone so take the advice she gave me and go to someone else.

I plan to tell my friends and family, who all live in their service region to never book them for their events or PTA/school functions.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c128bd0ba9df:0x96fc4ff0fee0c681</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>recently had a party over the weekend for my daughters 6th and 4th birthday, and I was very impressed with this company, their staff and their jumper.

The party started off rocky because I did not order a generator to accompany the jumper because I was told that I can use the electricity at the church that is attached to the park. When the jumper arrived to that park, I was informed the electricity at the church was not working. The delivery man immediately got on the phone to see how he can help me set up this jumper before the party started. They agreed to set up the jumper and then send another driver with a generator so that I can blow up the jumper. After the first driver left, I was told that, in fact the electricity doers work, and I plugged in the jumper myself and it worked perfectly. I called the company again, and cancelled the generator.

Through all of that stress and confusion (and me being 8 months pregnant), this company never got irritated or was rude to me. They were so understanding and helpful and did everything they could to try to get my jumper, and my party, up and running.

I was very impressed with all of the staff and with their jumper. It looked amazing and kept the kids happy for hours.

Last year, I ordered a jumper for a park party and they delivered it late, picked it up late, and the thing kept falling over with the kids in it. Not to mention, they charged me double what Party On rentals charged me.

Party On Rentals has the best staff and the best prices around and I will definitely be calling them again for all my future parties.</text><Name>Jessica DeSpirito-Brown</Name></record></dataset><record>

Awesome service, friendly, timely arrival and setup was insrant also pickup without hassle. The jumper was clean and had no problems with it despite the wind which was abit stronger than normal.  It was a huge hit with the kids. The adults were able to enjoy themselves while the kids were having a blast. Will most certainly rent from you again.<//review>

PartyOn! makes it easy to browse & order their services, so that's a big plus.  Set-up & takedown are fast.  We had one issue where the rep discovered a problem with the jumper after it was set-up.  He was extremely apologetic, and they had to take it down & send for a replacement.  Fortunately the replacement was the exact same model as I ordered, and they had it set-up before any guests arrived.< /Review>

We had a party for my niece Stephanie's and Carlos daughter Ava Pena in Rancho Cucamonga in April 2017, Delilah was the one who assisted me.  She is great ! she always takes care of our order's, the rest of the office ladies are great too.  The driver's did an awesome job !!  they delivered on time, very kind.   We ordered a jumper, a popcorn machine, and we also ordered chairs.  Dalilah thank you again for your courteous and professional help ! Party on Rentals is lucky to have you there.   I will always recommend Party on Rentals.<//Review>

First I would like to say is the girl that took my order was very polite. Second the young man named Juan gave me excellent customer service. He cares about his job and the qualityof service. This pizza was the best pizza I have had in a long time, we order the divine swine and the Mexicana. This is my new pizza place I will be back soon.<//Review>

I visit this spot a lot since I work close by. I got to say the customer service is always great and they keep the place well organized regularly. Rates are fair and they serve large portions.<//Review>

I have been to La Vera Pizzeria many times because it is the best pizza in Santa Maria. It is owned and operated by a local family who has been around for many years and far surpasses all of the pizza chain restaurants in quality and price. La Vera is the only pizza I get in Santa Maria at this point. My favorite is the combo pizza because they load it with so many toppings! The cheap price does not reflect the quality of the ingredients or the generous servings.

To mix things up, I recently tried a sandwich from there too. This had not been my go-to sandwich place in SM, but after having their pastrami sandwich, I will definitely be going back for more. I never go out of my way to write reviews on the internet, but I was so blown away by this sandwich and their family has been so good to me for so long that I thought this was the least I could do.

Oh and don't forget the buffalo wings! And make sure you get some of their homemade ranch dressing for dipping your pizza, wings, and salads!!< /Text>

Delicious pizzas and great pastrami sandwiches too! Pizza was loaded with toppings- they are not skimpy when you ask for extra and it was all for a really good price! The crust is cooked perfectly every time< /text>

<Review>“Awesome" may be the most overused word around. Most things in life are ordinary, not awesome. I have eaten at dozens of Italian and pizza specialty restaurants, in New York, Chicago and also in Italy. La Vera pizza is awesome! It is so good, you naturally pause and slow down to better enjoy. Every element is of the highest quality, including the skills and dedication of the brother and sister owners. From crust and sauce, toppings to table, they serve the best. That's awesome.<//Review><GmapID>0x80ec6b80755bbc9b:0xd2601cf385221d4e< /GmapID><Rate>5</Rate><userid>116051952177397786993</userid><time>1576002796027<//time>< Response>

<Review>I love the pizza here and I especially love pepporonni pizza and their pepporonni´s are a little bigger and nicely spread along the pizza and if you love pizza that doesnt have a lot of sauce this is the best place to get your pizze.</Review>< Rate>

A large La Vera Specialty, added jalapenos, and an order of spicy wings (asked to have them extra crispy).  Pizza was perfect, AS ALWAYS. A 10 OUT OF 10. The wings weren't as crispy as I would have liked...that's why I didn't give a 5 STAR.  But the taste was really REALLY good.</text>

<text>Drove five hours for my mom's 72nd birthday, asked her where she wanted to go out to eat for her birthday, she wanted go to a place that served pizza; after looking at the reviews on yelp and Google, the La Vera Pizzeria would be a good place to take my mom. When we arrive and walking towards the entrance, (a manager or employee) outside the establishment talking on the phone blocked the entrance to go in; with her left-hand up she mentioned to us to stop, then waved her left index finger side to side, all without saying a word. Does this pizzeria have a dress code,was the (manager or employee) having a bad day; has happened to anyone else?</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Daleon and Colin provided upmost customer service as I walked thru the door and made me feel comfortable right away. The computer manager Michelle has great listening skills and made me a great recommendation on my new Bluetooth headset for working out. I got the under armour JBL cant wait to hit the trails now.</review>< Pics>

<review>love best buy, but historically this store doesn't have the best inventory. maybe i want odd things, but i typically have to order online or go to la Quinta and beyond. the staff is pretty great tho. have had some very knowledgeable assists with phones, etc. check Inventory online before you go. they will price match competitors...<//review><userid>113280197168742556662</userid>< time>

Staff are always welcoming and friendly their. They seem to be recovering very nicely from the pandemic closures with stocking items. I just wish they would go back to their regular store hours instead of  closing at 6pm<//Text>

Bought an open box TV, man at the store told us everything worked fine. What he failed to mention is it didn't have a remote, or a stand. This is stated nowhere on the box, or anything, so I only found out after driving 45 minutes to get home. The only assistance I've been able to get is that I can drive all the way back and exchange it for one that hopefully has a remote.< /review>

Bad customer service and the worse policy on electronics. I suggest buying all your electronics from Costco or Target. Try it and you will be happy with their policy. Hope Bestbuy close down.< /review>

1) It took 8 weeks to get a laptop battery replaced. 2) they had a very poor selection of new computers probably due to everybody doing virtual classrooms. 3) I was on hold for half an hour before I hung up - make a reservation to pick up my repaired laptop.
Nevertheless, the staff were pleasant and nice.  Being efficient and timely would be even better.<//review>

Best Buy is a good store but fails with actual customer floor assistance. If you know exactly what you want your fine, if not prepare to wait a while. The folks I have worked with are great.<//Review>

Best Buy has always been my go to place for consumer electronics.  They provide very comprehensive service contracts.  This store is like the rest: neat, clean, logically laid out.  The only issue I found was a lack of CDs for sale but with the raise of streaming music services physical media is going away.</Text>

Was waiting for help 10-15 minutes when they had some employees free to help. End up not getting laptop cause they ware out of stock. I did try give BB second chance after not buying nothing for 8years from them and I’ll stay away for another 8. Poor service,high prices.<//Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Rate>5< /Rate><review>This Best Buy is generally well stocked and next to a Toys r'Us and a Costco. Most of their products offer a Geek Squad discounts that adds to and often extends the factory warranty. We purchased one of their new TVs and purchased the extended Geek Squad warranty that is supposed to cover accidental damage protection, but later we found out it doesn't cover screen damage. Do be careful with their damage warranty.  The screens on the new flat screens can damage from only the slightest hit or pressure applied to the screen.<//review><gmapID>0x80dafde3e6807a97:0xbefe64af13b9ce0b</gmapID></record>

Was not happy at all. They have always claimed to neat anyone's advertised price, price match. They wouldn't on the phone. I applied for Best Buy card to get a more expensive phone. They told me o was turned down. I wasn't....I got home and had email that they wanted varification it was indeed me applying as to prevent identity theft. Big difference.. Have on over 20 years bought all my phones there. Not any more!
O..
By the way..I'm a 66 year old disable woman who was in a wheelchair so it's not like they could miss it. They just didn't want to. When asked why they wouldnt do the price match. He couldn't even give me an answer. Angery for such poor service.< /Review>

<text>Super friendly helpful sales people! I get the impression Best Buy has upped its game.I think they have come to understand that customers someone's want it at least like technical help in making major electronic purchases. So the staff I encountered were particularly good. The prices were comprable to what you pay on Amazon so why not have the personal service!?  I bought $500 work if goods that I had not even considered buying before that day. Seeing them physically and accidentally as I walked the aisles and catching surprise sales made the difference.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dafde3e6807a97:0xbefe64af13b9ce0b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I called best buy geek squad to see if they repair computers, they said yes. I described my problem and the type of laptop I have and they yes they can open it up to find the problem. I asked if they're sure because I live 2 cities away... They said yes. I drive all the way here, wait in line forever just for some kid to tell me they'll have to ship it to Apple and it'll take a month... I asked well can't you open it up first just to see why it's not charging? "no... We have to ship it to Apple"
OK then why tf would you say you work on computers, could diagnose my computer, have me drive an hour just to be told you won't even attempt to  diagnose it?<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Had to arrange Geek appointment for my laptop to be repaired. The booking process was horrendous 32mins on hold to get a weekend appointment.  The agent confirmed Saturday then email came thru Friday!!! Called back and phone went dead after 28mins!

If i knew system it was easy to reshedule on line. With the revised appointment i got confused with times and turned up 3 hours early, my bad! The door greeter directed me to geek squad waiting area, after being spoken to like s#it by the tattoo'd guy with plugs Sophia kindly helped me.

Sophia guided me, the non tech customer with care and professionalism. She backed up my laptop onto zip-drive & processed my repair in less than 5mins. She estimated it would take 4/6 weeks- in fact i collected it 2 weeks later.

The scheduled pickup option was 17th but when i rescheduled it gave me 14th! Whilst my laptop was ready for me and i was told all was good, clock etc was not set!

The online system is easier in practice, but appears to want you to jump thru hoops! One jump then reschedule button!

4 stars:
for Sophia and speed of repair.

1 star:
for nightmare of setting 1st appointment and an hour waiting on the phone.

PC not fully set up with clock etc

Dude with the tude and plugs.<//Text>

We went to buy a new tablet.  We're not pros, but we knew what specs we're looking for in a tablet.  The signs don't list the specs on their tablets.  We asked an employee for assistance.   He directed us to chairs in the front of the store.  I guess if you ask for help they give you a time out! Because even though there was a constant parade of employees walking by us, after 10 minutes no one even asked if we needed anything.   So we left, Amazon here we come!!!</Text>

If there is an automated answer,  you choose your department...then you wait and no one ever answers and eventually you hang up.  What a sad way to run your business.  Obviously very frustrating to say the least.  Many other places to buy the products I want.<//review>< Pics>

Extremely crowded and had to wait along time for help to buy a fitbit. They do not have enough help for the customers
They would not do match pricing for a lower product amount. Not a fan.....<//text>

<Review>Ordered a $1000 TV for delivery to my 80 year old mother in Palm Desert who is cooped up due to COIVD-19.   Delivery cost an additional $150.  Confirmed delivery date.  Got text confirming delivery time window.   My mom waited up past 9 PM. No one showed up,  no one called.  No one had a clue when she called the store the next day.  They offered a new delivery date 10 days in the future.  As the purchaser, I too called, no one could provide an answer and best they would offer is 10 days out for a new delivery date.  They told me to call 1-800-Best Buy even though it was their own store order and their delivery person.  I was polite and asked to speak with manager at which point they hung up on me.  Best Buy is not what it used to be.  Canceling Order,  ZERO STARS will buy my TV at Costco.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My front yard a couple of months ago Best Buy was a great place to go to I gave it 3 stars because he didn't have any inventory I had to order everything that I wanted which was in a lot but I did spend more than $200 Room I like to store now like to shop there but it would prefer to have more England Tory where I can look at what I'm bi and about a tripod and I like the picture because it with the lot like my old one but when I opened it up and I got home it was all plastic it's pretty hard to put AV camera professional camera Canon on a plastic tripod little scary and when I have to go back and I will order another 1 hopefully I'll get get 1 the chin stock the last 1 was in stock but the rest of stuff they had to order 3 stars< /Review>

Products advertised are not in stock. They seem to push online sales forgetting that a retailer should have the products stocked as advertised. For a store focused on electronics their selection was limited.< /Text>

wanted to purchase an outdoor audio system and went to the visit the Palm Desert Store in person. Met with the In Home Design Sales Manager who quickly made some recommendations and sched. an on-site visit with an installer After meeting with the installers I was ready to make the purchase but could not get the Sales Manager to call me back. He had provided me with an email address as well as his cell work #. After sending one email leaving 3 voice messages and 2 texts over a 7 day period and not getting any response back I went with a different company.  Very poor customer service and follow through.</Text>

In these days where most buy their electronics online, it's refreshing to see a store fairly stocked so you can see and try out  before you buy. Great customer service!</Text>

Great brick and mortar store to look at a great selection of electronics. Most of the bigger items needed to be ordered as there is low inventory at this time. Friendly and helpful service.</Text>

Palm Desert Best Buy really seems to have there act together. Several years ago I bought a beautiful 70" Sony tv on overstock there for a great price, today Geek Squad actually fixed something on my phone that La Quinta Geek Squad had to refer to PD. So PD Best Buy is where I go to get my tech. As a pro photographer, I've even found their photo crew to be very knowledgeable. Having working in tech for 20 yrs, I also know it's not easy to acquire a knowledge base that allows one to address issues that can spread across multiple technologies. PD Best Buy seems to train to that goal. I'm impressed.</Review>

Okay I'll be a bit critical and bias to this review, let's start off with entering the store,
The main the guard is quite friendly and quick to the point. As well very knowledgeable about inside the store also quick to make a joke

Upon entry of this store you're greeted by a phone display sometimes I can be well stocked other times

Pros:
This is a list of things that I'm going to be putting down as I think to be a pro inside the store

Number one: offers somewhat knowledgeable staff but they aren't the greatest, now if this was a micro center this would be a completely different story the staff there is really well knowledgeable to the electronics they know inside and out

Number two: did you ask for a TV well let me tell you this TV for your TV and if you need a TV for your TV there's more TVs for TVs
All jokes aside they do have a great selection for TVs

Number three: does anyone ask for a printer I don't know depends on what kind of printer do you need the printer to print the printer or a printer that can just print out documents, well if you ask for a printer that can print a printer I'm going to silently let you down on this one but I do have some great selections on one so I can print out documents

Number four: they still sell CDs come on what more are you asking for?

Number five: you can just place the supplies in the fridge microwave or dishwasher they got you covered trust me if I need to put a dishwasher inside the refrigerator that'll be the first question to ask I had no answers yet.

Cons :

Have you made it this far great if not okay cool but let me tell you this the company could use a better computer for being a Best buy or AKA electronic store you would expect to see a bit broader more computers but this is more generalized as a more typical oh I just need a computer nothing for really for people that are really into electronics and are willing to drop that yes I know this is a niche hobby but it really does show how much people do love this The geek squad yes they're great and all but they're tend to be overpriced and like in my eyes if you are a power user like I am and if you're reading this you're probably a power user if not that's great if so that's also great if you read this far I love you 😊 because to be honest reading this lengthy list of me rambling is it achievement of myself

Too long didn't read, tdlr : Best buy okay but price check everything and I mean everything I was able to save about over $500 on a TV by doing it<//Text>

Sergio in the electronics department was extremely helpful and informative - you can tell he really cares about helping his clients and helping his clients find a product that is a good fit for their needs.  It’s always so great to receive such excellent service in a retail store.  Good selection of products and helpful, attentive staff.  Thank you so much!!</Review>

Okay I'll be a bit critical and bias to this review, let's start off with entering the store,
The main the guard is quite friendly and quick to the point. As well very knowledgeable about inside the store also quick to make a joke

Upon entry of this store you're greeted by a phone display sometimes I can be well stocked other times

Pros:
This is a list of things that I'm going to be putting down as I think to be a pro inside the store

Number one: offers somewhat knowledgeable staff but they aren't the greatest, now if this was a micro center this would be a completely different story the staff there is really well knowledgeable to the electronics they know inside and out

Number two: did you ask for a TV well let me tell you this TV for your TV and if you need a TV for your TV there's more TVs for TVs
All jokes aside they do have a great selection for TVs

Number three: does anyone ask for a printer I don't know depends on what kind of printer do you need the printer to print the printer or a printer that can just print out documents, well if you ask for a printer that can print a printer I'm going to silently let you down on this one but I do have some great selections on one so I can print out documents

Number four: they still sell CDs come on what more are you asking for?

Number five: you can just place the supplies in the fridge microwave or dishwasher they got you covered trust me if I need to put a dishwasher inside the refrigerator that'll be the first question to ask I had no answers yet.

Cons :

Have you made it this far great if not okay cool but let me tell you this the company could use a better computer for being a Best buy or AKA electronic store you would expect to see a bit broader more computers but this is more generalized as a more typical oh I just need a computer nothing for really for people that are really into electronics and are willing to drop that yes I know this is a niche hobby but it really does show how much people do love this The geek squad yes they're great and all but they're tend to be overpriced and like in my eyes if you are a power user like I am and if you're reading this you're probably a power user if not that's great if so that's also great if you read this far I love you 😊 because to be honest reading this lengthy list of me rambling is it achievement of myself

Too long didn't read, tdlr : Best buy okay but price check everything and I mean everything I was able to save about over $500 on a TV by doing it<//Text>

We purchased three new phones and Ricardo helped us.  He was very professional and had a polite demeanor.  He was patient with us, as we must have asked him a zillion questions and he answered every one of them with a smile.  We felt that he genuinely enjoyed his job and that he was happy to help us out.  He is an asset to your organization.  A company is only as good as their employees...first impressions mean everything to customers.<//review>

When I got to the store I did have to wait in a line but they had a cover over the sidewalk for shade and fans with water mist.  They had a salesperson who went to each customer to see if they knew what they wanted and I showed him on my phone, he went and got it so when it was my turn all I had to do was go in and pay.  They observed proper Covid precautions and were very helpful and polite.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>On July 4th,
I purchased an iPad
from Best Buy.

My IPad was not in the store
and in-fact would not be ready until July 10th.

They offer curbside pick up
in order to limit a customers exposure and risk of COVID19
and I elected to use this service.

On the morning of July 10th.,
I received the expected email from Best Buy
informing me that my IPad was ready for pick up
and
Instructing me to send them an email
when I would be parked out-in-front,
and ready for curbside delivery.

I never sent Best Buy a reply!

In the early afternoon on July 10th.,
I received an astounding email from Best Buy
Confirming my pick-up and thanking me for my business!

I was never anywhere near their store!

I immediately attempted to call them
and after a 30 minute wait,
I was finally able to reach a real person.

This person put me on-hold,
and when she returned,
she informed me that
someone with the receipt picked it up.
She would not tell me who, or when this took place
and she refused to give me her name.

She also informed me that
as far as they were concerned,
I had my IPad.

And since they had already charged my credit card
and they had their money,
they couldn’t care less!

Their Customer Service isn’t Customer Service,
I tried for hours.

In frustration,
I finally contacted my credit card company and disputed their purchase.

This story isn’t over.
I don’t think that this was just some random thief,
it looks to me more like a inside-job,
And
I doubt if this is just an isolated incident.

This also helps to explain why
Best Buy has no interest in reporting this crime
to law enforcement.

To say that I have no faith
in the honesty and fair business practices
of the Best Buy organization
would be an understatement.

<Text>I hate this location because there's usually two - five employees bunched up acting casual or " to busy to help" they never approach you or offer assistance. I have found only one employee at this location willing to assist. My guess is that I look like as if I'm not going to drop money on the bigger items so there's no commission and therefore I do not need to waste the employee's time. Don't bother calling at passed 8 because the phone will ring for 10 minutes plus, and if someone picks up then they will act as if they can't hear you and hang up. I so done with Best Buy and this SHAT location.< /Text>< pics>

I've always had good experiences with this Best Buy. Every time I've needed help I've been assisted by staff that have a great deal of knowledge and even passion for the things they explain, whether it's wifi systems or headsets. I've had an installation done on my car there and their auto-tech lead is knowledgeable, efficient, and just a super nice guy. Two big thumbs up!<//review>

Sales Staff very helpful and very knowledgeable about all computer needs and purchases. But I'm losing my trust with Best in Palm Desert The Geek Squad and Store Manager the worst ended up going to another Best Buy and handle all my computer needs and repairs.<//Text>

<text>I ordered a suite of new appliances for my new condo. Ordering by phone was ok but took well over one hour. On delivery day, the installers had all of our beautiful new appliances except they had a Samsung washer instead of a dryer. The person who took my order over the phone entered the wrong sku number. This is where the saga began. I spent 1.5 hours on the phone with the store to resolve it and get a dryer delivered ASAP. The dryer I wanted was not in stock and they would not upgrade me to another dryer that cost $50 more.  They said they could not process a credit for the washer until it was checked in and marked returned at their warehouse on Monday    I was promised a phone call on Monday and never received one. I called Tuesday and the phone rang for 10 minutes before someone picked up.  Over the next two weeks, I spoke with rude employees (Angel twice) and an Uber rude supervisor (Heidi) who told me there was nothing they could do because the washer was not checked in at the warehouse. I offered to send photos of the return paperwork the installer had me sign but nobody would except it.  I tried to get the name of the store’s general manager and district manager and was told I had to call the corporate headquarters.  I tried but was transferred to the complaint department which had a minimum two hour wait time   Finally, I received a call from Larry, the general manager, who promised to fix the issue and credit my account that day. He did!!!  Two weeks later, I am receiving emails and phone calls from Best Buy to deliver that washing machine. How messed up are they???<//text><GmapID>0x80dafde3e6807a97:0xbefe64af13b9ce0b</GmapID>< Response>

<Review>Yes, we went on “cyber Monday” but purchased the item on Sunday prior to our visit . When we arrived the “online pickup “ area had no one there and the line to “check out’ was immense .  At least 15 people waiting.  When we finally got to a “customer associate” we understood why the line was immense . They could not find anyone’s items and were all just running in circles .  What a circus this place is.  I understand why amazon does so much business now - take out the human idiocy of it all.< /Review>< Pictures>

Best Buy has a large selection of items to choose from. We ended up finding a vacuum cleaner that we like and purchase it. After purchasing it we walked over to Bed Bath & Beyond and it was there the same price but we had a 20% discount coupon. We went back to Best Buy and they honored the 20% off. They also have a fairly generous return policy. You can bring back an item if you're not happy or for any reason within 15 days after you purchase it for a full refund. The salespeople are very helpful and will answer all your questions.  they are also quite knowledgeable. Pleasant shopping experience and I'll be back.< /Text>

Today, I walked in and started talking to the first person I saw which was an employee named Marco. He was such a big help and his customer service skills were on point! He was fast in assisting me with the camera I was looking for and even gave me a great matched price with it as well. This store all in all is filled with great employees and it's super clean. I would recommend Best Buy for all your electronic needs! Thanks Marco!</text>

I was searching for a specific game called Until dawn for the PlayStation 4 and I wasn't really expecting them to have the game but lucky enough, I was able to find the game on disc and I've been enjoying it way more than I thought I would. Best buy really has everything you're looking for.< /Text>

Pretty good, (merchandise wise)  considering there aren't many stores like this around this area. My biggest gripe is service. If people in this store were more colder to their customers, we'd have to wear snow jackets year round! If they had competition, I'm sure they would be forced to be warmer and more polite to their customers. If there were another electronic store close to me, I'd never go back to Best Buy, in a heart beat. Sad part is, management doesn't seem to care.<//review>

My husband and I were following up a refund on our best buy credit card which I have been following up for over a week.  Service is very slow.  People don't know what they're doing,  kept passing us from one department to another... very frustrating if you're dealing with employees who are not trained. Bodies are the but empty heads!< /text>

Great place for all of your electronic needs. They don’t usually carry the high end apple electronics, like the iPad Pro or the more expensive laptops. You would have to go to the apple store for those. Other than that they are pretty well stocked up on most of the items. Staff can be a bit over bearing at times, every turn I take I have someone asking me if I need any help, but I suppose they are doing their job. Very clean and pretty organized.<//review>

Always a great experience,
may have to wait a bit but they are all busy. Dolby made my TV choice easy , fast and helped me get it delivered/ set up by the geek squad and they did an Amazing job.
Dolby in TV told me about the membership Geek Squad offers saved me a lot of money and now I can have my laptops and all technology questions answered and service by Geek Squad. Thank you Bestbuy And the great people there helping us shoppers life easier.<//Text>

My blackness is never more felt than when I go to this Best Buy location. I forget with every purchase vowing never to return then time elapses as well as my bitter feelings only to have the same experience. I go there knowing what I want but can't get anyone to acknowledge me. On this occasion I stood in the computer section for over a half hour and not a single "blue shirt" offered assistance, despite their having seen me standing there. I would not be so quick to blame my race for this if I hadn't used my time waiting to observe the white shoppers get offered help over and over again. I approached another black man, who was also there to purchase a computer and  asked if he had been helped and he answered in the negative. This gentleman I even recognized as a local TV & radio personality. I explained to him that the only reason I keep coming to this store is because it's the closest one to me and I am a card member who values the special financing. I  just happened to had run into another acquaintance,  who also is black in the parking lot prior to my entering the store who took his need for a computer to Costco. Check the cameras around 4 PM the day of this posting. The local celebrity had to send an employee to me after having been assisted himself. The employee was very polite, helpful and apologetic after I gave him an earful. I walked out of the store with my Dell laptop but I also left with resentment.<//Text>

Very uncrowded. Spoke to a salesperson when we needed to without being pressured at all.
Bought exactly what we wanted and something we didn't.  . . LoL.

Another Best Buy let down.  I drove 45 minutes to my local store because they said they fix cracked iPhone screens on site.  That's false.  They ship them out and it takes 2 weeks.  Raise your hand if you want to pay $150 and not have your phone for 2 weeks!!!!  Best Buy has proven again they are worthless and everything they say they do can be done online for cheaper and faster.  I won't miss them when they go out of business.</review>

I am a huge fan of Best Buy and have been going there for electronics my whole life but this store specifically and the “asset protection guy” who wears a yellow shirt and stands at the door with a bunch of tattoos and the store manager Scott have ruined it for me. They have lied over and over again regarding a credit card fraud issue and refused to pull up the cameras even to the police because they already have their own “suspect”. Terrible experience.< /Text>

Very nice store, very well stocked. They will match prices with some popular online competitors. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but the only downside to this place, besides the restocking fees and short return window (obviously, that's a general Best Buy policy, not just at this location) are SOME of the employees. I found at least 3 very helpful and knowledgeable workers, while some of the other employees were very dismissive or would completely pretend that the customers were invisible. Inexperienced workers should be trained to be more respectful to customers and responsive to their needs, instead of making you feel like you are bothering when asking a simple question.< /Review>

<Text>Was in the store and photography section for about 40 minutes, ready to buy both a mirror-less camera, and a compact camera to go with it. A lot of staff walked by, but none inquired if I needed any assistance. And it wasn't as if they were busy. I guess a drive to LaQuinta is in order..< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I love Best Buy. They have great products and service. However, I opted to have something delivered and the carrier actually left it on a public walkway between 2 condo complexes near what's considered my back door. Lucky I checked the tracking and it said it had been delivered - I drove home from work to find it proudly sitting there advertising by the box it was HDTV, before someone else snagged it. Best Buy, you are wonderful but your carrier are idiots.</Text><date>1520638337239</date><rating>4</rating>< Name>

I went to purchase a laptop and then ended up finding out that my previous laptop was easy to repair. I returned the unopened laptop and best buy reversed the charge on my debit card within 3 days. I was very satisfied and was expecting the worse but all went smoothely. Thanks Best Buy.</Text>

Went to look for a new beard trimmer, as my old trusty one finally bit the dust.
They had a larger selection than any other store I'd been to and I got a 20% discount on top of finding the swanky new model I wanted!< /Text>

Typical Best Buy with LOTS of sales staff all over. The shelves are neat and well marked. Their prices are comparable to everyone else. Huge parking lot and easy to see from the street. They carry a good but small selection of computer components such as the power supply I needed.
Be careful when you buy multiple items, such as cables. They give you a good discount but take ALL of it away if you return one of the items.<//text>

<text>Is a great store, it has a lot of parking so no problem there, the store is big and well organized.

The people that work there are nice and very helpful, it has air conditioning  and that's a plus.

They take returns of you got a wrong thing, overall I had a great experience there got just what I needed without looking for it all over town.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80dafde3e6807a97:0xbefe64af13b9ce0b<//gmapID>< username>

Have gotten some really great deals lately at Best Buy. Got a great price on a new Motorola phone and a new HP two in one laptop. Just study what you want and check out their pricing. The two on one laptop dropped about $200 and then I bought it.</Text>

Not a friendly place to shop as the cashier gave me an attitude for making a return. The product did not meet specs and returned for a refund on July 27th. I still haven't received my refund even after a couple attempts with contacting their online agent help, no progress. Almost 2 weeks later, still no refund.< /Review>

<Text>I bought a new LG Phoenix3 to replace a phoenix2 with a cracked screen. I played just 49.99 , and it's the best purchase I've made. When the salesman set this phone up it was the smoothest setup I've seen yet.

It's well-stocked very clean young energetic salespeople. They got top-of-the-line everything there. I remember way back those place used to be gigantic selling music  CDs their competition was Circuit City. Always a good experience going to Best Buy the staff in Palm Desert are very nice very eager to help intelligent and worked pretty hard on their feet all day.<//Review>

Good location. We go here, usually 2-3 times a year. Sometimes, the prices knock us out, but if you pay attention to the ads/sales even better deals than their competitors can be scored. THAT'S when we pounce!</text>

<text>As a gadget and electronics geek, it pains me to have to rate Best Buy only three stars, because I used to love this place.  But the fact of the matter is that I easily get identical hardware from online vendors for significantly less money than what Best Buy sells them for.  I used to justify that because Best Buy has their protection plan for hardware - You can get a three year accidental damage warranty for a laptop, for example.  This sounds great, but unfortunately when the time comes to get hardware service on something (in this case a laptop), they mail your equipment away and it's gone for two or three weeks.  I had this happen to a client of mine, and the laptop came back broken - It wouldn't charge or run off of AC power.  So, I went back with them to Best Buy, and the staff said all they could do was send it away for repair again - For another two or three weeks!  The "peace of mind" that their protection plan offers is unfortunately not all that helpful if you need to get your equipment repaired in a timely manner.

All this aside, they still have a great selection of items and you get to physically touch and see what you are getting before you purchase it.  I recognize that this costs more money than a web retailer.  Still, if someone is going to spend several hundred dollars on a premium extended warranty, they really should get premium service, not a month and a half wait to get their hardware back in working order.<//text>< Name>

Great customer service. Had an issue in the past with customer service and informed their customer care. Managment took note of my concerns and addressed the issues in a timely manner. Was not going to return to this location but  decided to give managment the opportunity to address the customer service issue. Had a great experience when I went back. Thank you.</text>

Nice Best Buy with increadibly friendly staff, my wife and I went to have our Neato robot vacuum looked at and there was no real line to even the week after Christmas. Once we were helped the store clerk at Customer service, she checked our warranty, validated that we had the required components to exchange it, and had us picking out our new robotic vacuum in less than 10 minutes. Quick trip with no issues.<//Text>

Since this is the last of the national electronics chains, we all basically have to go to Best Buy for consumer electronics, unless you are happy with online only purchasing.    Sometimes they have good sales which are worth jumping on.  The rewards program is helpful too.  Bought some hard drives, which then gave me a credit so I could get the stainless steel pot for my $30 Insignia instant pot knock off (same manufacturer).   Plus, got bonus points from Chase for shopping through their website.
Overall the employees are helpful, and and not too pushy.  But, not all are very knowledgeable, which goes for mostly all retail stores.
I'm glad it is here,  and wish that there were still places that offered competition like CompUSA, Circuit City, etc.</Review>

I went in to use their bathroom after noticing the urinal wasn't working properly I informed one of the employees.  His response was yeah I know It's been that way for months.
I wonder if an electronics store doesn't have a phone to call a plumber or a printer to put up a sign to say " Temporally out of service"
Horrible staff & even worse management....<//review>

Not having any basic dustergas kind of sucked when I needed it. But the fact that I was told where to go to to find it was good enough</Review>

I come here for Geek Squad Services. Fast easy efficient and knowledgable. Yes, if you make an appointment it WILL be honored. If you don't make an appointment don't be in a hurry, your bad, it works if you know the system. I've seen a few people with bad attitudes who come in here wait in line cause they don't have an appointment only to complain and throw a fit ( really ? ) Plus they give you stink eye cause you came in after them and are called on first cause you have an appointment, they don't< /text>

Not one employee greeted me, going in or leaving 😕 No one ever asked if I needed help, nor did any employee ask me if I was finding everything ok. Didn't buy a thing, looked around for at least 30 minutes. I even noticed an employee on her phone, she didn't even look up and acknowledge me. Wow 😠 No one could be bothered to help me. So I left and will not be back to that store. I think it's considered Palm Desert/Rancho Mirage on Hwy 111.< /Text></record>

<Review>Can't say whether they had what I needed because the employee that "helped" me took about five seconds to listen to me and say they didn't have what I wanted. Last time this happened at best buy I went and found it in the store on my own. I said be going back. This is why brick and mortar electronics stores are going the way of the dodo. No pride in their product. I'll have what I want overnighted from Amazon.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have been to this store many times. In the past I have left screaming and swearing never to return. But sometimes you've got to. Today was a wonderful experience! The customer service was above and beyond! I could not have been happier. From computers, appliances, DVD/Bluray, TVs, video games, and now even drone tech, they have it all. Only thing they don't have much of anymore is music. They do have some, but it's slim pickings. If you need electronic of any kind, this is your Best Bet.< /Review>

Staff was setting talk and joking with each other. Asked for help and felt I was a bother. As a paying customer I left not feeling that good about the experience.  That was the fiest time in Best Buy I left feeling that way.</review>

<review>Very happy in the store and with set up.(a week later). But when my main remote  went out(Direct tv). I called for simple walk through  to help me hook up my sound bar to to remote control, and then got hit with a $199.00 service fee. I DON'T THINK SO . Especially  after spending $2500 to begin with.</review>< pictures>

Fraustrated as I spent a great deal of money purchasing it, and needed an efficient system as I run two business and studying for an MBA, I called the manager Ben of the store , he was a star, he helped me efficiently in returning the original Mac, and attaining a new one.  He was understanding and went the extra mile to help me be on a system, to complete my business,  while was waiting for my new computer. His approach and manner of handling this situation definitely released my stress, his staff was as helpful as well.<//review>< Pics>

Terrible return policies: was told if phone service didn't work at my home I could return phone with a $35 restocking fee, was NOT told I had time limit.  I intended to use phone at out of town home and needed to test to see if there was service available on Sprint, By time I got back to store it was just after their 14 day policy and they would not return or exchange.

I am able to use phone on Verizon but not all features work since it was not an original Verizon activated phone.

I'll be spending my money elsewhere in the future.</text>

This is the most horrible Best Buy. I called customer service because i had purchased 3 anime blu rays for my little brother totaling over $120 and his playstation 3 broke and the customer service said they should exchange them for in store credit or regular dvds as long as they were unopened. In the store different story not only would the manager not exchange them but i waited in line with no one at customer service counter for over 5 minutes and on top of that i found out 2 of the 3 had regular dvds included with blu ray and so i only ended up needing the 1 exchanged and he still wouldnt do it. Wow this place also must hate GAYS cause under his breath as i walked away i heard him mumble under his breath "we dont help your kind."<//text>

<review>The worst. Went to geek squad on a Monday to have a simple keyboard on my lap top replaced. I had ordered keyboard they recommended in advance. They said couldn't help  me until Thursday. Went back Thursday and checked in which includes paying in advance. I was told about 1 to 2 hours. 2 hours later I received an email saying finished. Went in to pick it up after work at 5. Nothing had been touched. Told me they would have to send it out. They wasted a whole week, had me pay, emailed it was finished and never did anything. Just offered a sorry and a credit for the charge. Doesnt cut it. The worst service ever. On Saturday I replaced the key board myself and I know nothing about computers. I'm wondering if I'm an idiot when it comes to computers I cant help wondering who hires these geek squard employs and what you would call them if they cant repair a keyboard and deliver what they promised. Never again geek squard!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>I bought a mac computer 6 months ago, and had to turn it for repairs almost three time in the last 6 months.  Fraustrated as I spent a great deal of money purchasing it, and needed an efficient system as I run two business and studying for an MBA, I called the manager Ben of the store , he was a star, he helped me efficiently in returning the original Mac, and attaining a new one.  He was understanding and went the extra mile to help me be on a system, to complete my business,  while was waiting for my new computer. His approach and manner of handling this situation definitely released my stress, his staff was as helpful as well.< /text>< pics>

Some of the worst customer service ever experienced. After 45 minutes of being ignored & then being told by a clerk that one of his 'friends' would get to me shortly, I walked out.  This was mid afternoon and the place wasn't busy. It's no wonder people do more online shopping.<//review>

I hate coming to this store.
Their costumer service is really bad.
I came asking for helping on a product and every person wearing a blue shirt “I’m busy right now helping another customer”
Yet i see them all walking around on their phones and on the computer.
I literally asked 3 people if they can help me and everyone was “busy”
Busy doing i dont know what....because the store was empty.< /Text>

Door greeter was chasing me, wanting to see my receipt after I made my purchase. Totally uncalled for, FYI you don't have to show your receipt there if you don't want to. Guy seemed to enjoy his power trip and said that he has legal authority to check my receipt... Lmao!< /review>

I gave a three because I took a TV in that was under warranty to be repaired and got it back a month later. The repairs were done and completed in about 2 weeks so I don't understand why the shipping took another 2 weeks for me to receive my TV. My warranty wasn't supposed to be up until January 4, 2019 but they cancelled it after the repair. The TV was defected from the time of purchase, it wouldn't connect to any cable company but because it was mainly used to play games and watch movies I didn't take it in sooner. But they did fix the problem and it's working so far. I hope there aren't any issues after the 30 days warranty expires.< /Text>

Marco in mobile and activation was awesome, he put up with us for the better part of an hour and all we purchased was a 7 dollar flip phone. He was very patient and accomodating and went above and beyond to assist us with the sim card adapter and let us use his phone to call and make sure everything was working properly. Marco is the type of person who makes trips like this worthwhile when we have been putting off looking at phones, he made it very simple and easy and I would highly recommend asking for him at this location.</text>

<review>Stay away from Best Buy...  return policy is very bad.  I had a 3 month new Netgear Modem/router that went bad according to Spectrum Cable company.  Best Buy will not exchange it!  This is a defective item that they sold me, and no exchange!   GO TO COSTCO, best return policy!  Screw Best Buy!  They need to go out of business!<//review>< pics>

Stay away from Best Buy...  return policy is very bad.  I had a 3 month new Netgear Modem/router that went bad according to Spectrum Cable company.  Best Buy will not exchange it!  This is a defective item that they sold me, and no exchange!   GO TO COSTCO, best return policy!  Screw Best Buy!  They need to go out of business!< /review>

<text>Ordered an upgrade phone, and asked to have it mailed to my home in Erie Pa...or sent to the store here. Not one employee would help me. Nothing but lame excuses...especially from Ben the one Manager who ansewered the phone when I called to get this very simple task taken are of. Ben was full of lame excuses...cant send the phone across state lines, cant resposnible of lost (The carrier takes liability once picked up). Laziness...in its purest sense. If you are reading this...Shop the store, see what you like, then leave...buy on Amazon! Horrid customer service from BestBuy...dont spend your money with a company that does not truly have a customer service number, that has a system to call back diasppointed customers. Shop anywhere else!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Really bad customer service!!. We waited and waited, and waited. Every employee said, "ill get someone to help u"...NOBODY ever came. The place was almost empty and all the manager could say was that a cashier called off and there were more customers than employees ...what i dont understand how he could call 20 people in the entire store busy. We took our business to PACIFIC SOUND.< /Review><date>1545192214384< /date>< Resp>

Door greeter was chasing me, wanting to see my receipt after I made my purchase. Totally uncalled for, FYI you don't have to show your receipt there if you don't want to. Guy seemed to enjoy his power trip and said that he has legal authority to check my receipt... Lmao!< /text>

< Review>
We just leaving this store. Most rudest judgmental place you can be at. If your Not white recommend not evening going here. I waited to buy Mac computer waited 15mins for someone to help me I had to find someone she stated to she will be right there. Another 5 mins go by and she’s went to help these other people. Like I wasn’t waiting and she looks at me and keeps walking. So I just left I then went to my husband and he said he’s getting the same attitude they have a big guy watching his every move he’s trying to buy a tv yet he got no help but being watched finally I asked for manger he comes and I’m telling him my concern and the way we are being treated as a costumer and his excuses is He hired new people and they aren’t trained right. I won’t go to this Best Buy anymore. They lost 5000 in a day spend because they want to be racist and not help all people but pick and choose who they help.</Review>

Staff is great with communication and help if you need it. The only hindrance is that they take forever picking up their phones or they do not pick up their phones.< /Review>

The staff here is a little "too" helpful. I went in there with a friend so they could order a game, and some how walked out spendong $50. Lol. Seriously, I had some questions about Xbox One battery packs, they personally showed me where they were at (none of that "over there some where" stuff). Then, they explained the difference between the two that i wanted to buy based on thwor price tags. Then! They showed me "last years" discounted game selection once they saw money was an issue for me. Great place, and I compared them to Amazon, and they met, or beat the prices on there.

Also, was a clean place, no disorganization amongst the aisles.<//review>

<review>Really bad customer service!!. We waited and waited, and waited. Every employee said, "ill get someone to help u"...NOBODY ever came. The place was almost empty and all the manager could say was that a cashier called off and there were more customers than employees ...what i dont understand how he could call 20 people in the entire store busy. We took our business to PACIFIC SOUND.</review><Time>1545192214384<//Time>< userid>

Stopped by the Palm Desert Best Buy to see if they had a case for the Samsung Note 9 that was released for pre-order about a week ago. Chuckie, a clerk at the Samsung counter found not one but two cases that exactly matched the style I wanted.

-The entire visit lasted less than ten minutes!

-In other similar stores it takes longer than that to just find a store employee, let alone one who knows the inventory as well as Chuckie did.

- I was surprised that their stock included cases for a phone released that recently!!< /text>

Not only did their pathetically unknowledgeable staff give me erroneous information as to what was compatible with what, but they had the audacity to place me on the "do not return" list which was not only embarrassing but even after removal at a corporate level,  continues to plague me.

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>If I could indicate ZERO stars, I would! Two different sales reps with no idea at all what they were selling. Spent $65 only to discover once I got home that I needed more than what was in the box, yet no one in the store bothered to provide me with that information before I left the store ... TWICE in one day! Had to make two trips across town, and now will have to make a third because BOTH USB-to-HDMI adapters that I bought do not work! Attempted to call store three times, endured the computer-driven answering menu three times, got disconnected by the in-store operator twice! Finally spoke with store manager, who could only confirm that the device was not working. Seriously, could these people BE any more incompetent and useless?!?!?<//text>< Pictures>

I love Best Buy, always have, always will.  I recently bought a plethora of items there including an imac, hp envy, a bunch of accessories and more.   Not only did their pathetically unknowledgeable staff give me erroneous information as to what was compatible with what, but they had the audacity to place me on the "do not return" list which was not only embarrassing but even after removal at a corporate level,  continues to plague me.  Sadly, I will never shop there again and recommend everyone else do the same.< /review>

I had a good experience.  We went in to buy a phone with one promotion, found out that the promotion was for a different phone (still not sure that was correct) but ended up with the phone for nearly nothing out of pocket and a cheaper plan to boot.<//text>

There employees are poorly trained, with no knowledge of products, sale items, or anything really!... but?.. it's (BestBuy) so?... what do you expect?.. shop online, order online and opt for in store pick up to avoid the unnecessary run in with an 18 yo on spring break trying to gather beer monies for the week!<//Text>

Horrible place service and info really sucks, looking for something in particular they tell you to go online to find it. So why bother going to the store they might as well just close!</review>

Pain in the a$$, with an online order you must show the online receipt & photo ID when I know what was ordered & in have the credit card that was used on order.
Just inconvenient...</text>

<text>i went to best buy  and visit the  exclusive service there were two guys ahead of me,  there was only one employee (BRIAN) i waited 25 mn, then after the last guy,  Brian got up and left without saying anything,  i even say hallow hallow,   he did not care,
i understand that one employee doesn't run the store,  i know most of the guys are very helpful specially the ones in the video department< /text></record>

< Review>
If you order an item online the arrival date on the checkout page is false. I paid for expedited shipping but the item arrived 3 days after the posted date. If you need items by a certain date, don't trust Best Buy to come through for you. I will be returning this item to the store. If they try charging me a restocking fee for their mistake, I will sue them in small claims court, all on principle.< /Review>

It's worthless to try and get someone on the phone, especially someone in a particular dept. This is really important when it's a long drive to the store and want to be sure a product is there.< /Text>

Custom service sucked ..this is the first time i used this format to complain ..guess you cant look like a typical palm desert resident from the vintage club..was one employee that did help out and thankful for his assistance..he was off to lunch..need more people like him in your business..</review>

Bad experience, not enough personal on devices, had to come back a second time just for them to tell me they don't have any of the accessories for my phone even though I looked it up online.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, not much can be said here. I was looking for a camera and wanted to see different models. The seller of me should advise, I had to teach the first reason reasons. A salesman who does not know what full-frame means ... and says he takes pictures with his cell phone ...
Dear shop owner, myself and many people are certainly willing to pay more than Amazon, but we also want to get the service. Only whining about the evil online trading brings nothing.

(Original)
Hier lässt sich leider nicht viel positives sagen. Ich war auf der Suche nach einer Camera und wollte verschiedene Modelle sehen. Der Verkäufer der mich beraten sollte, dem musste ich das erst einmal Grund begriffe beibringen. Ein Verkäufer der nicht weiß was Vollformat bedeutet...und sagt er fotografiere mit seinem Cell Phone...
Liebe Fachgeschäft Besitzer, ich und viele Leute sind sicherlich bereit mehr zu bezahlen als bei Amazon, aber wir möchten auch den Service bekommen. Nur jammern über den bösen online Handel bringt nichts.</review>
