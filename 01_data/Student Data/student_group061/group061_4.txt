<Text>I've been seeing Dr. Elloway for 20 years now. He has an incredibly kind bedside manner and never suggests work beyond what is necessary for your best dental health. He gives you all the information you need to make your own decision. Every time I've needed a procedure it's been comfortable and painless. He has a special numbing machine you can't even feel! He's actually done a few fillings on me he didn't even need to numb for. Most recently we did Invisalign and my results have been fantastic. Dr. Elloway is a gentle, sweet, and honest man I would recommend to anyone (especially those nervous about the dentist!) His staff is awesome and the cleanings here are excellent as well.<//Text></record>

I have visited Dr. Elloway several times over the past few years. His office staff is friendly and efficient. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for my appointment, as he is prompt and seems to stay on schedule. Dr. Elloway is always concerned about his patients comfort and has a very gentle touch. He informs you of what he is seeing and doing as he is working on your teeth. I’ve noticed how he keeps up with current dental technology and has   all the equipment to provide state-of-the-art care and highest quality dental work.  If you are looking for a new dentist, or have dental problems that you need taken care of, I suggest you contact Dr. Elloway’s office for an evaluation. I know from experience that you will be highly pleased with the results of his work.< /Text>

Dr. Elloway has been my dentist for 34 years. He is ethical, competent and trustworthy. It is important to me to have a longterm relationship with a medical/dental provider. He had been there for me through many years.<//review>

< review>
Dr Elloway and his staff are beyond wonderful!  Our first visit was a month ago for my 96 yr old mother. She had an abscess and needed four teeth pulled. Her previous tooth-pulling experiences with other dentists had not gone well. Painful dry sockets and a lot if pain post procedure. Dr E was so careful and took his time with her to such an extent she couldn’t wait to go back!  Bedside manner rating is off the charts and quality of care as well I have never experienced this much care and interest in the patient. Today was our fourth visit putting some final touches on her new partial plate (flipper). Mom said I could go back every week! If you’re looking for quality care at reasonable prices this is the place. You will be greeted with a genuine welcome and know that you’re cared for. Lori is up front and Deanna assisted the good dr. Both as terrific as the doc. :-0.<//review>

<Text>This is a state-of-the-art dental facility.  I’ve been coming here for many years.  Dr. Rob was the first dentist I’d heard of who started and finished a crown placement in the same sitting—no need for another day of missing work for the “final and permanent” crown.  My co-workers had a hard time believing that I was finished in just a couple of hours!

He and his staff are excellent and welcoming.

Dr. Elloway is the best!  We have been his patients for over 20 years. His knowledge of dentistry is far superior than that of the dentists I know of in the Inland Empire. Everything is high quality, and he is a perfectionist. He uses the best labs, but he does not gouge his customers. He always gives options. His office staff are gracious, professional and remarkably accommodating. He is the only dentist for my family. My son is leaving for college, but he will continue to see Dr. Elloway because he does not want to change dentists, even if he has to use vacation time to see him.<//review>

I have been going to Dr. Elloway for my dental care and routine cleanings for at least the past 10 years+ and could not be happier with the care I have received. The office space is clean, modern and welcoming and his office staff is wonderful.

Dr Elloway takes the time to examine your teeth/bite and integrates new technology which improves precision and patient comfort. I’ve never had a painless dental block until coming to this office.

If you have a specific dental issue he will help you come up with a detailed customized treatment plan. In my case, it was addressing my nighttime teeth grinding. Dr Elloway is the best!</text>

<review>I’ve been a patient of Dr. Elloway’s for over 15 years. After several negative prior experiences, I was relieved to meet a dentist who listens and is patient with their clients. Dr. Elloway now is my children’s dentist, and we make the drive from Murrieta because he and his staff are the BEST! If you are looking for an honest, caring, and competent dentist, give his office a call!</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Everyone is wonderful at Dr. Elloway’s office! I’m able to walk right in, get seen quickly-I never have to wait. I schedule an appointment every 6 months to have my teeth cleaned there. Thank you for taking care of my teeth!!</review>

<review>Extremely professional dentist and staff, very friendly, considerate,and trustworthy as well.
I have never felt so at ease at the dentist as I do here, I've had many filling and haven't experienced any pain. I really feel that Dr. Elloway truly wants the best for his patients and is willing to go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. Im nearing the end of my orthodontic treatment using Invisilign and I am very happy with my teeth, next up is bonding and possibly a couple dental implants in the future; before I would have never considered dental implants but now that I see what a gentle and professional dentist Dr. Elloway is Im on board with the idea.
If you're looking for a dentist with state of the art equipment but want a dentist with the old time personal care, then the dental office of Robert K.Elloway is the place for you.< /review></record>

I've been coming here for years and is by far the best value by far for service, cost, etc. I do only think they take PPO plans or limited HMO (Delta Dental). Thry also do special procedures, includong costemitc, night guards, and invisilign.<//Review>< Rating>

This review is long over-due a few months ago I dropped off my 02 GSXR 750 that wasn't throttling correctly. I arrived and was greeted by Polo, he was welcoming and very knowledgeable. He told me everything that needed to be done with my bike and quoted me a reasonable price.
It took some time because it was hard for me to find the correct parts I needed. But when my bike was done I picked it up and it was running back to
Normal, felt like it had even more power than when I first rode it.<//review>

BEST MECHANIC IN CALIFORNIA. I have been coming here to Moto Tecnica for the past 5 years, ever since I started riding my 1994 Kawasaki zx6 ninja. Pollo has treated me like a friend ever since my first visit. Pollo will help you  no matter what and will not take advantage of you. Moto Tecnica for life.

I took my bike in for a oil change and I marked my filter and some bolts to make sure I received the service I paid for, when I brought my bike home and inspected it I found the bike still had the same oil and oil filter, the bolts were not touched and I paid for a service I did not receive. Very bad and unsafe business.<//Review>

Would absolutely recommend to others and will return.

I got in here to get a set of tires mounted. Polo jumped in and helped me out immediately. Every other shop wanted atleast 24hrs if not more.

They've got a ton a stuff in that shop and will help you out and do the work you want done. Polo's experience about kind distance travels was certainly helpful too!</text>

<review>The best experiences in ANY motorcycle repair and custom shop in all of LA take place at Mototechnica. Polo and his team are deeply knowledgeable with just about every bike you can imagine. I've taken my my bikes here for almost a decade, this is your best bet to get any bike into happy territory & our coffee gang has a healthy line of bikes. Thanks for all the years of great service, nothing even comes close!</review>< pics>

Awesome prices. Honest, knowledgeable owner.  He will give you the most for your money. I love this shop! If he feels you could get a better deal if u buy your own parts he will tell u to buy your own to save you that money. He’s not trying to rip you off at all!< /review>

<review>Bought a power commander for my R6 from polo sold it to me for a price I couldn’t resist. Polo is the definition of a real honest Motorcycle mechanic. He will give you the best advise and price on everything he has. He’s that type of mechanic I am willing to commute from Irvine to LA just to get work done on my bike. Hard to find a good motorcycle mechanic nowadays.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Polo is far and away the kindest, most generous, honest and straightforward mechanic of any variety I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. His shop works fast, clean, and they get it right every time. Not to mention the absurdly low pricing. Completely worth the effort to get there from anywhere in LA to get your bike worked on. Could not recommend this shop more highly. 11/10 stars.</Review>

To keep it short. I walked in once for tires and noticed him working on repairing a practice bike for a guy who I guess rides pro. That was enough for me to come BACK for my tune up, brakes and tires I need. Coolest thing about that is he was cool with shipping my tires to his shop, and just charged the labor. It's the second time I shipped my tires to him, it's a shop worth going back to.<//Text>

I am a man that researches everything I am into with extreme detail and take it from JV from FIT45 that this is the number one motorcycle shop in Los Angeles.

Love going here took two bikes one for changing my tires fast service and the second to change a chain. Both times being there took the bikes right away and done right the first time. Not like other bike shops recommended to come here.</Review>

At Moto Technica Polo always comes in with an honest approach, breaking down the cost of parts/labor and or cheaper solutions if you're in a tight spot. Little things like wiping down your bike after a service or replacing a damaged screw are taken care of without even having to ask. The attention to detail is the reason I keep coming back.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Polo is very knowledgeable person, caring and very passionate about Motorcycles. His pricing is very reasonable and you get the best out of it. I went to many shops in LA for my bike and the only place i can truly recommend is MotoTecnica. They have it all (CustomerService, price, peace of mind, professionalism,Fast delivery) , I highly recommend MotoTecnica for any  Motorcycle work, they are subject matter expert.</Review></record>

Took my bike to the Authorized dealer a few times before I figured out they didn't have a clue, and didn't care.  First time I took my bike to Moto Tecnica I just needed a tire put on.  Polo put on the tire, and not only that he adjusted the motorcycle for my weight, the reason the two previous tires kept wearing out quickly.  The Harley Davidson shop I'd been going to before didn't even bother to give an effort to do this for me, even after paying an "evaluation" fee on what the bike needed.  Polo also told me of other problems that needed to be addressed, and one problem only the Harley shop could do, (ugg) proprietary tools I figure.  When my bike needs help, I know where I'm heading.< /text>

<text>I was referredrefer from another moto shop
( No Limit Kustoms) to find exhaust gasket  for my Honda Shadow.
4 Star does not reflect overall experience I had here, 4 stars was for barely having the part I needed. Owner Polo was Koo, hooked me up w/ his tech to assist me w/ part I needed.
Place isn't hard to find but finding parking is bit of issue ( best come in yer Moto, there's enough parking for a few right in from of shop).</text><Rating>4</Rating>< user_name>

Best motorcycle shop in so cal. Unlike most shops who have no clue, take a problem to polo and it will be corrected even if it means machining something that works. This shop is good for people who expect a problem to be solved rather than someone looking in a computer and have no clue.<//Text>

They used to be good I guess,
Overpriced at times.
I went to get my bike tuned at moto tecnica, got a New chain, tires, and other things I requested and paid for, but when I took my bike to the dealer two weeks later for a recall, they notice the tires weren't aligned, the chain was loose, the forks were leaking, the valves were not adjusted amongst other things!!!
Last time I go there!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
had a very bad experience there, had my clutch done it was making a noise, They didn't replace my clutch and my crankshaft got messed up and wanted to charge me $1800, I felt scammed and most definitely overpriced, a very bad place to take your bike to get it done :-(< /Review>

<Review>I really wanted to love this. The young man cashier was very friendly. It is the closest poke place to home. The Salmon and Tuna cuts were stringy and hard to eat. The sodium level was so high,  I could not eat the fish without a bite of something  to make it go down easier. If they were not so nice,  I would have asked for a partial refund. I just tossed most of the food bowl :(<//Review>< rating>

Now, on to the food itself... VERY, very well done. The lamb chop was cooked heavenly, to die for! And the accompanying sauce paired perfectly. My absolute favorite was the bone marrow meal (which I had never tried, and was a little reluctant), it was delicious!< /Review>

<Review>BAD ROTTEN FISH. Will give you stuff you specifically said no I can’t eat that and won’t give you the items you paid extra for and said was the whole reason you came to that place. They don’t wear masks when making your food and they are wayyy too stoned to operate anything. Cost $24 for a bunch of seriously rotten fish and extras I never got. First time I ever threw food away.

I've been many places for an Acai bowl, but this place hands down makes the best!
I wasn't expecting much when I first came here wandering the other fooderies to get to it inside the market, but very very impressed.
It's like they're sprinkled with magic. So delicious!
I always get the works and they have never forgotten a topping like other places do.
When I think of one of my happy place, yup this joint comes to mind. 💜< /text>

<text>Friendly service.
Food was good. Don't remember the name, but i've asked a bowl with tuna. Very tasty, and apparently healthy.
I recommend it.<//text><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fccb09a4fbb4f:0x842185c8d398ca5a</GmapID><Time>1576545286663</Time><pictures>None< /pictures><name>Edson Noboru Yamada< /name>< user>

Best poke bowl in the San Jose. They have a unique sauce that tastes like no other. Fresh salmon and the best natural juice you can find. Definitely recommended.< /review>

I wanted to like this place but there are much better poke bowl places in SJ. I ordered the spicy tuna bowl with rice and salad (to go order). The poke was drenched in sauce. Unfortunately the rice was steaming hot so it cooked half of the poke tuna in the closed container. The mango and avocado they include are already brown even though I came pretty early in the day (11:30am)< /Text>

Colleague and I came by on a whim thinking we can do better this time around. Poke bowl remained the same consistency, but rice could be a tad more. We share the bowl because our next meeting with long time clients will feed us. It's certainly better than the first time when they open.<//text>

Good sized servings of nicely prepared food that will fill you all the way up. Nice mix of flavors and textures.
Smaller size portions are available too.

This has quickly became my wife and mine Friday ritual, whether she meets me here after work after I hop off the light rail at San Antonio de Paseo, pick it up on my way home or when ordering from Door Dash. We can’t tell which is better - the wonderful and always smiling owners or their generosity in giving us more than ample proportions of the most wonderful crab (sourced from nearby Dai Thanh Supermarket) and tuna. Once you meet this dynamite couple, you’ll want to come back just to say hello (they’ll remember you!) and order again.< /Review>

Just ate there. Having the option of white or brown rice or a salad mix is nice. They don't use "the" authentic rice you'd get in Hawaii, which is/was Hinode, but it's close. The shoyu ahi side of my combo bowl - with avocado for free - but the shoyu salmon was disgusting. Fishy-smelling, low-grade, salmon-colored "stuff". I actually got a partial refund (the guy asked if I wanted my money back and I said since I'd eaten some about half back would be fair) because the salmon was gross.

The owners are nice people but some things don't translate well. I'd not expect excellent Mexican food back in Hawaii, for instance.

So if you go, avoid the salmon, get the avocado add-on if you like that sort of thing because it, or a number of others, are included in the price, keep in mind they've got shoyu and furikake etc there to put on yourself, and yeah, the servings are decent.</Text>

<Text>If there is one thing on the menu to get, it is their acai bowls. Truly authentic and delicious! I also tried their Shoyu Ahi Tuna bowl and enjoyed it - it was a little more bitter than I liked (the tuna had a stronger flavor) but it was definitely very fresh. I can't speak to other reviews but you could tell this was definitely a Latin American twist on poke and I really enjoyed it. Is everything a bit pricey? Yes, but the acai bowl is well worth it!
PS - the folks running this place are really awesome - a really great experience!</Text>< rate>

Today I had the shoyu wild salmon with brown rice bowl, fresh pineapple juice, and the Brazilian crazy chocolate cake. Their poke is great. I've had their acai bowl before too, and it's super good. Today however, the chocolate cake was my favorite part. It is SO GOOD. It is the best chocolate cake ever! Not even kidding. It's light, simple, but really... get a poke or acai bowl when you go there, and don't leave without getting the cake. You will regret it!<//Text>

The shoyu ahi bowl just seemed off. The sesame oil was overwhelming, the rice consistency wasn't a great fit with the rest, and I wish there were more ingredients in the bowl. I took it home and turned it into fried rice, which was a huge improvement.

I'm sorry to say that it was the worst poke bowl I've had so far, and one of the most expensive.< /text>

Not fresh, and sad amount of avocado and fish compared to rice. The juices were good though.</text>

Lots of hidden (unfair!) fees!
I told to have 8 weeks free rent! but I just get 6 weeks in the lease.
Besides, I charged $400 for parking and utility for a single month!

Although the community is great, there is no transparency and I do not recommend it at all. They are not responsive!</Review>

I have lived here for 1 year, poor and rushed decision and I would avoid this building at all costs. So many better quality / location /cheaper options out there.

The main issues are as detailed, fire alarms constantly going off, both in the unit and in the building its self. Because of the frequency of this, the residence don't take them seriously representing a huge health risk.

There have been multiple break-ins in the garage with car windows smashed and the glass just left on the floor for weeks and even very recent issues with actually employees speeding through the garage putting the safety of other residents at risk, I have also had to report homeless people in the building to security x3 in the last year as gates are often left unlocked, very concerning for anyone with a family.

The back of the unit near the fire lane, constantly has trash left out in the dumpsters which in the summer sun quickly start to smell very very bad.

The Elevators all have expired permits, some over 1 year.

Over all this has been a truly disappointing place to call home. The number of students of UCI that live in the building is extremely high and that is not the community we were looking for, on top of all these serious issues.

Please think twice about living here. A home is meant to be a place to relax and this is not it.< /Text>

irst,i have to say the location and design of this apartment is good, and that why this apartment becomes the first choice to move-in. However, the problem is the official service is not good. When I try to schedule an appointment for a studio with a budget around 1900, but he/she directly provides the plan with 2000, so I have to continue scheduling an appointment next week for a better plan. After finding a good plan  (though the location is not good),  the staff told me everything before move-in, and we thought everything is done, we can begin to pay a deposit and sign the leasing document, he then replies that the plan has already been leased. what hell is that? I spend valuable time trying to find a better room plan, but he just makes me a joke?  but anyway, I really appreciate he/she to give me time to find another good place to live.<//text>

<Text>Avoid this Irvine apartment complex at all cost! I'm a current resident, have been for 15 months, will not be renewing again. We have experienced the following since we have moved in:

- exploding appliances
- lightbulbs falling from the ceiling
- drawers and cabinets falling
- overflowing trash facilities and disgusting odors in the hallways
- upper floors are more humid than a Florida swamp during summer months
- staff using public drinking fountains to fill buckets used to clean toilets (first floor bathroom by the pool)
- Hallway entrances smelling of animal urine and feces
- Disrespectful residents that party loudly and make noise all night.
- fire alarms consistently going off, which has caused multiple residents with noise sensitivity issues a great deal of harm, including people in our family.
- packages stolen A LOT

from other reviews here on Google:

Car break ins
Weak security
Surprise charges
Intimidating to live here with aggressive residents
Intentional manipulation of residents by management

As far as management goes, they go out of their way to distance themselves from the problems their community faces. I have spoken with several residences that are fed up with the quality of maintenance and management, which has gotten much worse since COVID, but they can't afford the lease break penalty.

Some of the issues are:

- disregarded work orders and maintenance requests
- selective enforcement of policies (i.e. special treatment being given to certain residences who have romantic relationships with people in management)

See pictures attached for an example of what a normal day looks like in the hallways of the Residences on Jamboree.

For what you are paying to live here, do yourself a favor and find somewhere else. You will NOT be happy with your decision to move in here. You will not see the problems until you have already moved in. I've lived in multiple apartments in my life and this has been the worst experience by far.

Working right now to get out of my lease.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdz_h5yHl1x-K-RxBR73-FL1Vcc_0XY_acub86=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4BwwqBaRZaoZ4JndT-QTV1dJjMv9zgE2Gr6rR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

Rude and  unprofessional are the two words that would best describe Anna DeMartino. I should have figured an unmaintained unsafe property like this would hire just about anyone.

Save yourself the hassle with this leasing company.</text>

HIDDEN FEES AND CHARGES:
Be very mindful with this property, they have a very helpful team, however that’s more than what can be said for the company itself. We’ve have over 3 errors or mis matching prices before we’ve moved in, and the only response is “UDR Is very strict”

MOLD & MILDEW:

UDR is aware of this issue and refused to address it nor fix it. They will say it’s a part constraint however the manufacture will deny this claim and provide you the part upon request within 3-5 business days......the real reason? Staffing, because they don’t have someone to order the part we are not stuck with the previous tenants moldy appliance.

HARDWOOD FLOORS MISSING:
These floors are cheap, and missing several planks of wood. Cheap contractors at high price is what you’ll find here.

It’s a shame because the maintenance staff is very polite and nice, however UDR as a whole clearly doesn’t care about their teams safety, their tenant safety, or property.

VANDALISM:
First day we moved in, our front door was vandalized. Our neighbors have had it happen repeatedly and they don’t care. I’m sure they’ll attempt to charge us at the end for this.</Review>

Fire alarms is running randomly.

Sometimes once a week, AM times, PM times. It’s just unacceptable. Absolutely error in the system. But, this is what leasing staffs and management will say: “it’s a non-smoking community and sometimes residents smoke in their apartments”.

Come on!!!!

Most of apartments in Irvine are non-smoking community and I’ve never had this experience in any apartments. Even my friends who are living in different apartments in Irvine were shocked when I ask them if they are having the same issue !

This is the fact, we don’t even know when the fire alarm is running because of REAL fire. If that’s the case, lots of residents will be in trouble.

PLEASE do not reply with just being sorry.

PLEASEEEEE FIX THIS ISSUE.

Thank you< /review>

Turns out the reviews about the constant late night fire alarms AND car break-ins are true. If you work from home, this isn't the place for you. Otherwise, great place.

We moved in late July. Here’s a tally of how often the fire alarms have gone off (I’m sure there have been more when I wasn’t home). They usually go on for 10-15 minutes:
1) 8/16/19 - time unknown
2) 8/17/19 -12:30AM
3) 8/29/19 - 1:30AM
4) 9/13 - 2:20AM
5) 9/14 - 4:20am
6) 9/23 - 10:20pm
7) 9/26 - 7:30am
8) 10/18 - 8:26pm
9) 12/15 - 1:29pm
10) 1/12 - 1:46pm
11) 1/14 - 11:51pm
12) 1/14 - 11:59pm
13) 1/24 - 9:01pm
14) 2/8 - 6:08pm
15) 3/17 - 3:30pm
16) 4/11 - 3pm
17) 4/17 - 5:40AM
18) 5/30 - 8:47pm
19) 6/1 - 1:03pm</review>

The fire alarms sound in the entire community when any smoke is in the area, the community is 100% non-smoking, so any smoke of any kind will set these alarms off. Management implements the non-smoking policy to all residents and have posted signs in all the elevators informing all of this policy as well as signs along the community. We take this very seriously and send violations notices to anyone that is not complying with community policy.\n\nThe maintenance team walks to trash rooms several times a day to ensure they are working properly and no trash is left outside. If the compactor is left open on one floor it will disable all the other floors as a safety precaution. Please contact the leasing office if you ever come across the shoots being out of service or overfilled and we will take care of this.\n\nThe amenities are available for reservation and a first come first serve basis. If you check the resident portal you will be able to see if there are upcoming reservations in order to utilize these areas when needed. Management does not allow all amenities to be reserved on the same day, if there is ever a reservation for one, you are more than welcome to use the other.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional comments or concerns.\n\nKind regards,\n\nBree Flanigan\n720-348-7620\nWeCare@udr.com"}< /response><GmapID>0x80dcde836ce925c1:0xfdb1e7e6a6559217<//GmapID><Text>Pros:
- Management/Maintenance teams are responsive and pleasant.
- Building itself is generally nice.

Cons:
- Fire alarm goes off constantly, most often in the middle of the night.  I've lived here 20 weeks and there have been at a minimum 19 fire alarms that I've counted (not to mention more I'm sure I've missed).  Not only is this an extreme inconvenience and annoyance, it's also potentially really dangerous in the event of an actual fire.
- Tenants are incredibly dirty.  Garbage is constantly overflowing in the garbage room.  Dog poop and urine in the hallways and stairwells on a daily basis.
- Parking lot security is weak.  Guests will follow you in through the lot to avoid security on a daily basis.  Have seen broken glass multiple times.
- Very few sponsored events.  Rooftop is often rented out to third parties.  If you're looking for a place to meet new people, this is probably not the best spot.<//Text>< user>

This building is full of amenities from the sky deck for parties to the courteous and helpful leasing staff.  Always a smile and a cheerful greeting when you see them.  Andre who coordinates the efforts of the maintenance team never fails to get things corrected the same day as reported.  They all remember your name.  I would highly recommend giving this place a shot when looking for a classy place to live.

Great place to live! Everything is top of the line and kept very clean. It is safe, up-to-date and at a great price. Hadiha is fantastic if you want to be shown around, she will not pressure you into anything and explain all about the complex in great detail. Highly recommend checking this place out!< /review>

<Text>Do NOT put your phone number on any of their forms if you’re looking here. They will harass you via calls and text messages that you will not have opted into(which is illegal). Give a fake phone number. I’ve asked to be removed from their contact list and they continue to contact me.

I got a tour here, it was great except it seemed like they were up selling me for things that I did not need. Also, they charge a $25 registration + $5/month to use their mailbox package system. So you will not be allowed to receive packages if you don’t opt into this. That is absurd and they might as well make it free like all of the other complexes around the area and just increase the rent. I was quite disappointed on how nice the place actually is but how badly it was represented by the staff and nickel-and-diming their operations is here.<//Text>< pics>

Coffee machine is often empty or not working, hot tub sometimes is cold and not working as well. I do love the location though it's unbeatable being in the center of orange county. Also maintanence staff are friendly, helpful and quick to respond to your needs. If working ammenities are not as important to you like they are to me, I would say this place is a win. Beautiful property but I'm hung up about my coffee and hot tub.< /Text>

Don't move here unless you enjoy not having parking (that you pay for), living with ant infestations, and inconsiderate community residents / neighbors. Also incredibly overpriced compared to cheaper, and nicer apartment options on the exact same street.

Irvine Company is known for raising their rent on long-term residents ON TOP of the already expensive price. Try to avoid them.

If anything breaks, putting a request in via the community portal is useless, they don't check it. Ever.

Due to water damage complications from poor construction, we've lived in three separate units on this property. All of which have had the same issues. Ants, inattentive staff, and dirty communal areas. The only current staff that have been helpful are the maintenance guys, but they can't help you unless the other staff alert them of the issues (which doesn't occur).

Absolutely, do not move here.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

I definitely  recommend this place because it has amazing quality apartments, it has an extraordinary pool and jacuzzi, it even has its own mini golf coarse. The staff here work really fast to help solve requests or problems you might have. I'm happy to be "The residence on Jamboree"😊<//Text>

My boyfriend lives here. The room, facilities and environment are pretty good. However!!!! The freaking deafening terrible fire alarm goes off randomly,wakes you up sometimes in the early morning, sometimes around like 3-5 am.
The room it-selves fire alarm is too sensitive, every time , I mean every single time, as long as I make steaks, it will go off.
有一次，我做番茄炒蛋，它都响了。</text>

<Review>1)My boyfriend’s car wheels were stolen, the staff who works in the leasing office did not give a damn about what we had experienced. The only thing they care about is when we will put the wheels back on so they wouldn’t get more complaints from other residences or people who about to move in here.
2) My friends and I were stuck in the elevator once, not only that the elevator was droped from the second floor to the first floor. Thank God we were all fine. It took over 30 minutes for the fire department to come and solve the problem. The elevator always stops working, be prepared of that if you want to move in:)</Review>< Pictures>

Worse experience of my life! I have never been so offended or felt discriminated by a company (like ever) I applied for their moderate income program and had 2 cosigners (mind you my income is okay) and the 3 of us weren't able to get approved like come on? It's a studio for 1500$ and I pay 1700$ now (Complete disappointment) and waist of time. The only reason I was going to settle was because I wanted to save the extra 200$ to do whatever. Thank God for the Irvine Company!! Great customer service and appreciate my business.< /Text>

<review>We lived here for almost a year, and would not recommend this place to anyone to move in. The staff there does not seem to care about the residents:

1) No assigned parking, and we could never find parking spot. Because of this, we sold one of our cars. If you like to have your own parking spot, it will cost you $100 for reserving a parking spot. (We searched for several apartments, it usually comes with a parking space close to the residence.) This is the only place that does not come with a parking spot. We ever saw one car with no wheels, because the tires were all stolen. Wow!

2) Fire alarm constantly went off, and it is very annoying to all the residents. The only explanation was the alarm system malfunctioned in some ways, but still the fire alarm kept going off for months. It even happened during mid night around 2-3 am, and lasted for about 30 min or longer. The staff just said that some residents smoked inside of their place, which caused the fire alarm to go off. So nothing much they can do to fix this issue. Does that mean we are paying the rent for some people to cause the fire alarm to go off to ruin our sleep? If you have a baby, this is a big no no.

3) We requested for window screen installation several times and it took about 4 months to get it done. I am pretty sure that the apartment has a lot of requests for window installation.
In addition to that, the service staff entered our apartment without having us on site. What if something valuable is missing, who will be responsible for it?

4) Trash room is always a mess, and you can never open the door for dumping. Also, every other day, the trash truck made so much noise (back up sound), and it gets annoying during the day.

5) There’s always people talking loudly after mid night, we can barely sleep with such high noises. Even we have security on site, no use at all.

We tried to get these issues resolved, however the staff made us feel like it was our own problem. Just because we already signed the leasing contract, there’s nothing they can do. We just want them to fix  the problem, but the problems are always there. I know every apartment has its problems, but they always try to fix it. Apparently not this apartment.

If you wish find a pleasant home, please make sure that your rent is worth the buck. This place is highly not recommended, or you will regret for life. (This apartment is a mess, don’t get carried away with the nice amenities - nice rooftop, gym - machines always broken, coffee machine- 90% of time not working). Be wise on your choice since there’s a lot of options out there. I hope this review helps anyone who is looking for an apartment, unlike us stuck with it for one whole year.< /review>< Date>

<review>The apartments here are very nice and have more of a hotel feel than an apartment feel. The pool area in the center of the apartment complex has a nice grilling area, Bluetooth cabanas, and beautiful glass firepits surrounding the hot tub and pool. The lounge area on the roof is a great reading and hangout space. The large outdoor TV provides for a quaint outdoor theater for you and some friends.</review>< Pics>

One of the worst places ever lived in especially if you have a car cause the garage is super insecure, my tires got stabbed and that happened to a bunch of residents but leasing office never really get hands on these problems. However, fees kept increasing and you don’t get the service that matches the price.< /Text>

This place is great except for the freakin fire alarm system that goes off randomly at odd hours of the night and wakes up  the entire apartment complex. I'm appreciative that they have one in place but not so appreciative when THERE ISNT A FIRE AND IT GOES OFF. I'll send them my hearing aide BILL!!!! They need cameras in the hallways and parking structure so they can figure who keeps setting off the fire alarm and EVICT THEM. Also why would the engineer/project manager who built this place allow dogs but put carpet in the hallways the place smells like dog piss now, good one. It's about almost 5:30am here, it's Saturday, I'm awake because I was awoken by the false fire alarm that went off at 5am and lasted about 10 mins long. The sound is so loud it literally blows your eardrums up! I will not be renewing once my lease is up! I want out already!< /text>

worse place I ever lived,
ants everywhere, insecure, and guest parking at six floor, very inconvenient.
if you gonna move in here, get ready to lose your car's wheels, or get your car scratched
no camera in parking garage, multiple theft and damage to vehicles happened, and leasing office does not care, always reply "working on it".</Text>

Pros: Wonderful building with fantastic amenities and management that is continuously working on improvements of overall experience. Cons: community - residents are predominantly loud, untidy, irresponsible with usage of pets designated area but these aspects are not reducing the overall experience we have in the building!  Strong recommendation!</Text>

Nice and clean place, good food. Shvarma in Turkish bread is definitely something to try. Sometime we order chicken diner to go, come with two large sides and pitas. Whole chicken with sides for $8? Isn't that a Deal?< /Text>

I love filling up a big plate with brown rice, seasoned tofu, butternut squash, sauteed kale, brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes.

7.99/lb.  Curry chicken was surprisingly good. Seaweed salad is delicious and doesn’t weigh for anything. ;) Appreciate the speed.</Review>

Good healthy options provided via salad bar. Pay per pound.  Eat in or take-out & quick.  Great vegetarian options, but a few meat options are available as well.< /text>

Wildflower is cafeteria style casual with no service per se'.  The food is VERY fresh and made everyday since the restaurant is open only 4 hours per day.  There is a combination of cooked food along with a salad bar, and a wide selection of healthy choices for vegans like me.  As already noted, you are charged by the weight so it is possible to be surprised when you get to the cashier after piling a takeout style box high with food.<//text>

Healthy food with a Korean American leaning.
Lean in to Wildflower Cafe. It's no nonsense & you get really delicious, healthy food.
Isn't it typically difficult to find any of these characteristics at an eaterie?
Not @ Wildflower cafe.
I recall the son of the owner working here. He was a lean, good-looking young man. He didn't want a cafe serving unhealthy food. He was an athlete.
The owners made a whole lot of fresh foods; some hot, some cold. Delicious dishes like: seaweed salad, buckwheat soba noodles with veggies, marinated tofu, steamed kale salad (my favorite!) and a whole lot of protein options like cold fresh turkey, baked chicken, beef meat balls, etc.
Feeling tired or stressed? Eat better! Get your food at Wildflower Cafe.
They're at the top of the "fresh" list for sure.<//Text>

1. Korean Glass Noodles (Chop Chae)
2. Bean Sprout Salad
3. Cucumbers in spicy paste
4. Brown rice salad
5. Chef's Special Chicken

Chef's Special Chicken alone is worth the trip, but all the dishes are terrific.</Text>< pics>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>FiDi salad bar with a wide selection of hot and cold food items. My favorites are the chef's special spicy chicken, brown rice, japchae, caprese salad, and brussels sprouts. Keep watch of how much you add to your plate though - everything adds up quickly and can easily reach $10+ if you get heftier items like the hot foods!< /text></record>

<Review>I would describe it as good cafeteria food. Service is non existant and the atmosphere is cafeteria. The cost of the food is by weight so if you order the right things it can be a good deal.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

This is a pay-per-pound kind of place.
Food is neither good nor bad, nothing special.
It may be a good choice if you're on diet as you can pick as little as you need.
There is no service so you can get in and out in a few minutes.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is not safe to send. They stole my shoes, makeup, deodorant, clothes, all that in one package. How bad sometimes we make an effort to help our families there and to get your things taken from you, no that is not worth it.

(Translated by Google) An excellent parcel service everything has come to me complete and not mistreated the only bad thing is the bad attitude of a young lady with very long eyelashes is very rude to very despotic people she has no ethics to say things very rude is the only bad thing from that place but the rest is excellent, I highly recommend it, there are days that give a special price and shipping is very cheap and with insurance😉👍

(Original)
Un servicio de paquetería excelente todo me a llegado completo y no maltratado lo único malo es la mala actitud de uns señorita con pestañas muy largas es muy grosera  con la gente muy déspota no tiene ética para decir las cosas muy grosera de plano es lo único malo de ese lugar  pero lo demás excelente lo recomiendo mucho hay días que dan precio especial  y sale muy economico el envío y con aseguranza😉👍</review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The service is lousy ... serving a single person with a row of 20 people ... writing down in a notebook ... and checking the deliveries in a notebook. (I think they don't know that computers already exist.) Serve a customer. And until they talk to them all their lives ... their plans and their goals ... attend to the one that follows ... maybe it is a family business ... but if they want quality service ... they have to update their system ... soon .. or to ask back .. because you see that they do not know what they are doing.

(Translated by Google) Good parcel service no more than now with new rules when delivering, since if it is at home it is an extra charge without saying how much until they are at their destination and thus not from here should be the home collection tab

Very clean and good service staff is also very helpful it's also cheap compared to other laundrys around the area that offer free dry but in the end the washers are so expensive that it comes out to be more expencive than paying for the dry<//Review>

The mornings are the best choice since people are still in bed at 8am. People who work there are helpful and friendly. Overall it's alright to wash there. Dryer 17 doesn't work and never will. The water there is not good. Makes you feel thirsty even when you drink a lot. Update: dryers 5, 3, 1 stop working suddenly.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I always do my laundry at this place!  However, tonight I had a fenomenal "customer service" experience. The owner, treated my bf and I very good. It felt like home. He went beyond our expectations of what an excellent boss is.</Review>

Nice up to date facility they have snack machines coffee a popcorn machine
They also have a wide assortment of laundry detergents bleach fabric softeners and laundry bags for sale
A plus for me is the fairly large parking area where I opt to sit in my car and relax when my clothes wash and dry.<//text>

<review>This school let's students walk out the front door to smoke weed across the street and then let's them back in campus at all school hours. Pretending like they can't smell the students all full of marijuana smoke on them. Even the security opens the door and says welcome back.< /review>< GmapID>

Your teachers need to get their numbers straight and stop using computers to call the parents. For months now I've been getting called from Compton High and only now figured it out it was from here. Kinda irks me that this would happen.<//Review>

<Text>I booked an appointment online for a cut and shampoo. Traffic is usually bad, but I got to my appointment early. As I give my name, I let them know that I'm early.

I was early and I didn't want to walk the mall and miss my appointment time. I'm a licensed cosmetologist myself and work for a company that has certain protocol for appointments. I completely am aware I have to wait and I'm perfectly fine waiting.

The lady checking me in looks at me weird and grabs the stylist I'm booked with from the back and both tell me that I have to wait for her next appointment to be over with for her to see me. Something I already knew. I explained I was aware of this, no rush. I just didn't want to be late for getting to my appointment.
The stylist comes and gets me from the waiting area when she is ready. I explain that it's been roughly 2-3 years since I had my hair cut at all and the last thing I did was shave my head completely due to hair loss from extreme anemia. I explain that I want to keep layers but take off dry ends and fix the natural disconnection that happens around the ear area.

Fun fact: if you cut your hair the same length all around, it's going to grow in at the same time all around and give you layers. It's  called a 90 degree cut.

She begins to dry cut my hair. As she gets to the sides, she tells me it's thinner there and asks if I had cut my own hair recently. She also points out that I have layers in my hair. I explained again that this was because I had extreme hair loss a couple of years ago and shaved my head completely because of this. After she cutting, she just curled it a little. I didn't get washed. I felt rushed out of her chair. Maybe it was for the best because the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.</Text>< Time>

<Text>The service at MasterCuts is reasonable. They accept appointments as well as walk-ins. The staff are Pleasant and friendly and the shallan is neat, clean, and well-organized. The prices are average, and they offer a wide range of services including chemical treatment such as perms and relaxing, and they also do hair coloring. Because of the high volume of customers, they often get distracted. So make sure you keep track of how they are treating your hair as per your request.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2d7d6fa27eb6f:0xd3f118f5d818b496<//gmap_id></record>

I have been coming here for nearly 10 years. It was my go to for a reliable haircut for $20($16.50+Tip). Staff was friendly and eager to help. Then it went up to $23, no big deal staff was still amazing. Now, they charge extra for shampoo and cut, the new staff is rude and impersonal ("It's always been $30.") They still have 2 really good hairstylists Suzette and the girl to the left of the entrance. But I finally called it quits. I'm not driving out for poor service and a salon price if I can go to an actual salon for the same thing.< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I had a girl that had pink hair and dress like a rockabilly girl. She is new at cutting hair and didn't really know what she was doing. She chop off my fiance hair and didnt even layer it right at all. And with my hair, thank God a Co worker was listen to what I was trying to say and came to help the pink hair girl. My fiance is very upset with her hair. We are going to call the manager and see what they can do. Not satisfied at all.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2d7d6fa27eb6f:0xd3f118f5d818b496< /gmap_id></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I went to go dye my hair and the color was nice. I told the stylist not to dye my roots cause i was going blonde and not everybody dyes their roots. So i told her to leave them alone so she also left my bangs alone which werent that short, they went down to my nose. The rest of my hair was this super bright color but she didnt dye my bangs. It went from black straight to blonde. DO NOT GET THE BLONDE STYLIST WITH THE SIDE PONYTAIL/ spanish accent, like you’re better off going some place else. They dont even cut hair that good. There’s a super cuts place across the street you can try but im never coming here again because they still charged me 170.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Now granted I came in a lil before closing but persons attitude was lousy, I asked her if they time to do one more cut and she looked at the clock and said we only have ten minutes left so no, I said you close in ten mins till closing and she looked at me and smirked and said I can't cut hair in ten mins<//text>

Walk-ins are hit-and-miss. Appointments are no use either.  Three times I've made appointments and all three times I was told I still had a 30-40 minute wait. So frustrating.< /Review>

These guys saved our butts! 2am on a 2,000 mile road trip and our trailer axle breaks 2 hrs from home. Towed our trailer to their lot on a flatbed and we came and got it the next day. I highly recommend the guys at Black Butte Towing! Great guys to help you out of anything situation.< /Text>

I foolishly got stuck in a snow bank & unfortunately learned what "high centered" means (believe me, you are better off not finding this out first hand). AAA was amazingly *un*helpful, between the automated phone menu that inexplicably does not feature "Emergency Roadside Service" as an option (Claims will get you there, for future reference) and the unavailability of their contract tower.

Thankfully the CHP referred us to Black Butte and Jeff, both of whom were fantastic. Friendly, efficient and they communicated with us throughout which was very reassuring since we were stuck in a remote area & facing a night spent in the truck if no one towed us.

Can't say enough good things - worth every penny and would absolutely use them again (but hope I don't need to).< /review>

Brain was amazing. Our car had problems at Old Ski Bowl trail head. Brain came all the way to the top to get us. Enjoyed a pleasant conversation on our ride down. He gave recommendations for in Shasta where to bring the car and helped us find the key drop box. Really helpful in a time when we were totally stranded. Definitely give them a call to help you out! The other plus was the price was great!<//text>

My car got towed off the freeway after a snow storm a couple weeks ago and bk  of different circumstances it took 9 days for me to pick it up........it was quite an ordeal,  but everyone I dealt with at Black Butte seemed to be understanding and very helpful.....which I really appreciated.</Text>

<Review>Had an excellent experience with Zach, who quickly arrived to the very out of the way and tough to get to spot I was stuck in, and winched me out in an efficient, very knowledgeable manner. With his easy going and calm presence, I immediately felt safe and good again. I got quoted for $1,200 from another 24/7 company in the area, and that made my jaw drop. Then I found Black Butte Towing, who took great care of me for a whooping 1/6th of that price. Thank you again!!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

So I know they are doing their job, not upset about that. But paying an original tow fee, okay good. But having to pay a days storage fee when it was towed late night and picked up first thing in the am and charged a days storage fee for less that 24 hours is a bit ridiculous. They have to make their money someway. I would never use them personally</Text>

<review>I was stuck on I5 in Dunsmuir in a snow storm last Tuesday and couldn’t get a local towing company to get me. Justis was a long way from me but he let me know he was headed my way and called me regularly to check on me as he made his way down from Weed. The highway was all blocked up but he eventually got to me and got me safely off the highway and to a motel. He was wonderful!<//review>< pics>

<Review>Brian picked us up in the middle of a winter storm. Our truck was pulling our travel trailer had thrown a shoe (chains). The chains must of broke my brake line. Brain was fast, the truck was clean and he took us to a safe location to wait for the service on a late Saturday night. Thanks much Brian!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Thoroughly professional and courteous, took good care of my Exploder, I mean Explorer, after it exploded southbound on I-5 three miles north of Weed, CA. Justice, the driver, was great: good sense of humor and kind-hearted, and he got the job done quickly and efficiently.</Review>

I met Brian about 16-17 years ago. When I was on an adventure. He helped me get the parts I needed for my 1978 Dodge Van. We got to talking, and he told me , when I got done with my adventure to come back and he would give e me a job driving truck for him. I regret not going back. But I think of him often. I wonder if he even remembers me. Brian your the best<//review>

<text>Wednesday night in the middle of no where, after driving hours with my one year old son from evacuating the Atlas fire, I stopped at a rest stop along the way. I accidentally locked my son in the car. After calling 911 and waiting with a very kind officer, the tow truck driver came. He got my car unlocked immediately and when he heard what had happened he didn't charge me, he was so kind ❤ I can not express how the officer and driver were amazing. Thank you so much. I wish I got their names.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Stopped in yesterday with my eye on a new car that drive time actually had online. Came in was greeted by Jay and the rest of the staff here I told them my situation and they did an awesome job in addressing my issue and we came to an agreement the bank accepted my offer and we closed the deal! A-plus in my book.. I'll definitely refer family and friends to stop by!! Thanks guys! #drivetime1007</Review>

I found DriveTime through a google search and I read the reviews of great service so I decided to come in and see if I could get a car. Jayson helped me and made sure he did all he could to get me into a car that I liked and wanted. Jayson did a great job explaining every detail about the leasing process and also made me feel welcome! I did not think I would be able to get a car that easily due to a low credit score. So, I am beyond happy with my experience! Their inventory is great as well I definitely recommend DriveTime to anyone struggling with getting a car due to a low credit score!<//Text>

I rarely give 5 stars because I believe everyone can improve but I have to tell you that my sales person Sergio was fantastic. His professionalism was definitely top notch. His patience with me in my long process to select a car was evident. So much so that he found the perfect car for me. Price was great and the mileage on the car was unbelievable low. In essence, Sergio assisted me in a brand new car at a phenomenal price. I truly recommend him and will be giving him a shout out to all my social media platforms. Great job Sergio!! I’m excited about my car.</text>

So I got a car here recently and I just love it. Sergio was awesome! He’s very nice, funny and professional. He helped me to get all the things I wanted covered. I’m picky lol found a car I loved , with low miles, had it brought over to test drive and was able to hold the car. My down payment was low and love that the payments coincide with my paydays. It was made simple. I highly recommend him! And the follow ups are appreciated. Definitely a great experience here.<//Text>

<Text>Had a fantastic experience with Marco! As someone with challenged credit these interactions can be embarrassing, stressful and honestly when is the last time someone said “fantastic experience” when referring to the car buying process?  He worked with us and showed all our options, wasn’t aggressive in anyway or even deterred with my very short time at new employer.  We got the car we wanted, at a fair price and a payment we can afford with no stress, no shame or haggling.  His manager (sorry forgot his name) took time to explain the agreement, terms, line by line and consistently checked for understanding, which is huge!  I come from a family of car salespeople - it was a refreshing experience!< /Text><user_name>Johnny W<//user_name><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80c32834de8738cf:0x11513752c372aa35<//gmapID></record>

The entire staff was friendly and professional from the time I walked in the door. My sales person, Jay deserves an award for his  efficiency and professionalism. He assured my complete car buying experience was expedited yet informative. I was in and out in less than three hours. Not to mention, their office setting was the coziest looking dealership I’ve ever seen. I’m now enjoying my new 2017 Hyundai Sonata and I highly recommend this location to anyone seeking a new car.<//review>< pics>

I had the best car buying experience at DriveTime. They are not your typical Car Dealership, they got me the car I Wanted. My credit is not the best and I was still able to drive off the lot with a 2016 Kia Soul. Please see my boy Jayson he’s the senior manager, he’s patient, has great communication, and walks you through every step without pushing anything on you. Ive recommended DriveTime to a couple of my family members and friends.<//Text>

<review>I just want to say this place is awesome. My advisor Jayson was remarkable!! He greeted me upon my arrival, was very patient being that I couldn't make up my mind quickly. He walked the lot with me explained everything about each car I looked at. This man was courteous, knew his job, very professional, and friendly and on top of all that he kept a smile on his face. The Manager Jonathan  and everyone were so nice. Drive Time is definitely a good to car company to use. I recommend to everyone go here for your next car purchase and ask for Jayson they will take care of you.</review>< Pics>

Initially, upon viewing my eligibility with Drive time, I thought the results were to good to be true.  However, I kept my appointment and sat down with, Jerald, a very informative gentleman.
After filling out the paperwork that was needed to be completed, I was able to drive off with my new car!!!
Thank you Drive time for such a pleasant experience!!< /Review>

<Text>We just purchased our 3rd vehicle through DriveTime.  Every experience with them has been great!  Jessica and Jesse were the ones that helped us get the truck we wanted.  They were both awesome!  A special thank you to Jonathan and Jesse who both stayed late just to make sure everything was completed so we could take the truck home that night.  I've already recommended DriveTime to a few family and friends and will continue to do so.  No complaints!  Thank you all!</Text>< gmap_id>

<text>I had a wonderful experience at Drive Time, due to my sales advisor.  His name was Bradley Kiyomura.  He went out of his way to get another car so I could test drive it.  I finally made my choice and it was fast and easy.  Gone are the days of haggling and high sell pressure..  Thank you Bradley for a wonderful experience.  I would differently recommend you.</text>< pictures>

Thank you Victor for the best car shopping experience any family could ask for. I didnt go into Drive Time with high hopes as I was turned away from big dealerships to smaller ones they were my last hope and guess what they are a blessing. Victor was able to help me out and got me aproved within the hour. Thank you to everyone at Drive Time for your hard work. 😁</Text>

Five Stars! This was the first time purchasing a vehicle by myself and Brad made the process go smoothly. Made my sister and I feel very welcome and everything took about an hour. He explained everything that the dealership offered very professionally and nicely. He was never pushy. Highly recommend to go to Drivetime because they definitely will help you.<//review>

<Text>Bradley Kiyomura made my first car purchase even that more special. He was very patient with me and helped me find the perfect car.  He made me and my 2 year old feel like family and went above and beyond to make sure I was approved and left with the car I loved. He even installed my sons car seat before we left. I would definitely recommend him 100%</Text></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>The entire staff at Drive Time have been excellent. The whole time of being serviced in shopping and purchasing a car was flawless.

I saw the commercial and thought I would give them a shot at purchasing a vehicle despite a repo on my credit report. They do not lie. They really do work with you to get you into a new car!!

As soon as I applied online, I got emails and phone calls from them to introduce who they are and what they do, and what to bring. I came down and asked them to help me get a car that fit my budget and they came back with some options. Josh suggested one vehicle in particular as the best "bang" for my buck.

Filled out some paperwork and was able to work them to complete my purchase the next day with my down payment. We went through the point inspection and finished paperwork. Easy breezy.

The entire staff have been so helpful. Very courteous, friendly, personable and always willing to provide solid answers and help regarding my vehicle, warranty and purchase questions.

I will never go back to a regular dealership ever again now that Drive Time served me with excellence and exceeded my expectations.

Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed with them!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Very honest and helpful service! Diana was great at making sure no information was left out and let me in on all the details.
Everything was very fast and easy!
I definitely recommend anyone to come give DriveTime a visit if interested in purchasing a vehicle.
Love my experience here!</review>

The whole experience couldn’t have been easier! We made an appointment with Marco after being pre-approved online. We went in, told them what kind of car we were interested in, test drove a few models, and drove out in our new car within a couple of hours. I love my car and am very happy with the whole experience!<//Review>

I was in a hurry to find something else because my car wasn't worth paying for it. With me being so young and on my own it feels good to be able to do this whole car process on my own! Drive time definitely helped me out with that and I can't thank them enough.

Sally was the one who initially helped me with all my numbers and all the gadgets to the car and Brad helped me finish the deal. These two are amazing. Great customer service. Thank you thank you thank you. 😁< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

They are very patient and to the point and I like that. Sergio, who is one of the staff members , assisted me with financing a vehicle and was very thorough and precise. He always called to make sure I didn’t have any concerns and was always able to answer all my questions. If you ever decide to stop by , I guarantee you that Sergio will get you what you are looking for. Props to you !!!</Review><gmapID>0x80c32834de8738cf:0x11513752c372aa35</gmapID>< Pics>

<text>Out of all the dealers I went to in search of a used car, hands down this place was the BEST!!! They way they handled everything from the phone calls back and forth to the paperwork was amazing. Jesse was so courteous and helpful, he answered all my questions and returned every phone call as well as followed up with me promptly after my vehicle purchase. Ken whom i signed my contract with was also very courteous he explained everything while signing and answered any questions I had. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friend and  any one looking to buy a car!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Bradley Kiyomura was the BEST car salesman we could of asked for. He worked with us for months and did tons of troubleshooting to get us the absolute best deal possible. He catered to our three children’s needs and was very accommodating. Bradley going above and beyond standard expectations made the purchase of our vehicle a very enjoyable experience.<//review>

I have purchased more than 20 brand new cars, and this establishment has shattered the negative sides of car buying that I have experienced. Big shout out to "Jay" and "Ken" for being an incredible salesman and finance duo. They were very personable and very patient with my family every step of the way. Great experience. Totally positive in every way. Highly recommend this drivetime to anyone and everyone looking to purchase a car.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pics>

<Review>Amazing first car buying experience! Diana was literally amazing. So helpful and pleasant. While the process was fairly smooth all around it was her personal touch that made the experience as awesome as it would.

Note, if you have outside financing you don't qualify for the 30 day warranty so when your window stops working 2 weeks after you buy your car it's up to you to fix it. They didn't mention that btw.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Where do I begin, We felt comfortable the minute we walked through the doors.... Bradley helped us and I didn't at feel taken advantage of...... Bradley seems very knowledgeable about this business... Matter of fact, I was shocked to know that he had only been with drive time for a couple months...... We were met with great attitudes all around. I came in and spent exactly what I had in mind and didn't feel suckered at all. This is a great place and I'll be sure to recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new car.</Review><Name>Sharon Smith<//Name></record>

Diana was awesome! After I shop around for so many months. I mean I went to all kinds of dealership I mean I even went to repossess auto sells and not even them could do it. Finally I gave her a try and now got the car I need and want. She is very friendly and lovely to be around. If you are shopping for a car this is the place and with Diana.<//Review>

Awesome service!! These guys have the best customer service and will really work with you. The process is seamless and easy, no level of complexity whatsoever.

Victor was amazing and so was Labri. They, along with the manager, really bent over backwards for me.

I strongly recommend this place to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.</Review>

She asked what we were looking for and helped us understand the process that DriveTime uses to help people drive off in a new car. She introduce us to josh who was also very helpful in helping us find the car that not only right in price but would fit our little ones too. They were so helpful answered all our questions and made purchasing a car the easiest I have ever experienced. I would defiantly recommend Drive time West Covina to all my friends and family and give them Naomi card.

Thank you so much for your time and patience. You went the extra mile to ensure that I was completely satisfied with the vehicle. Your attentiveness to my details got me exactly what I wanted. And the fact that you drove to another location to pick up the vehicle shows your commitment to going above beyond for your clients. Thank you for honesty and enthusiasm.

<Text>I changed this review from 5 stars to 1 star after my car broke down 4 times the first year! The drivetime sales team asked me to write the review in front of them the day I bought my car. Everyone is happy when they are buying a new car and I wrote a good review..but things changed drastically after my car kept breaking down!

I'm so disappointed with this dealership. They prey upon people with bad credit since they are the only dealership that would finance them. I ended up with a car payment of $423 and a 10 year old car with 100k miles on it. But I wasn't concerned because they sold me a warranty that they swore they stood behind. The car broke down on me 4 times the first year I had it. The first 3 times I got the repairs paid for after being in the phone all day and the claims we're denied until I kept calling until I spoke to the right person. The last time it broke down last week they denied the claim- power steering pump exploded. They said there was a hose that broke and they don't cover hoses because they are maintenance parts. So the entire repair job was denied. My car has been in the shop for 2 weeks and I have to pay for the entire bill of $600. I'm upside down in this loan and the car keeps breaking down and stranding me. I called the manager at the dealership who was extremely rude and indifferent. He just transferred me to their corporate office who scolded me for not preparing myself financially for this car to break down as I should expect the car to break down given how old it is..Yes she really told me that..blaming the victim. I replied, isn't that why I pay for a warranty?
Just a word of warning...they will be nice and helpful while taking your money when you buy the car...but when something goes wrong it's a completely different story. You would be better off saving up and buying a car from a private owner.< /Text><Name>Kathy Westwood< /Name><response>{'time': 1532030726797, 'text': 'Hello Kathy, Thank you for providing  your review and I am sorry to hear that your faith in DriveTime diminished from your first review, in addition to the multiple repairs that you have had done on your vehicle within the first year of purchase. Please know that all of our vehicles are pre-owned and inspected prior to sale. Since we can never determine when repairs would be needed on your vehicle, every vehicle sold at DriveTIme comes with a 30 day/1,500 mile Limited Warranty as well as an optional Vehicle Service Contract to assist with these concerns. There are times when repairs that are needed which are considered non-covered components and would be considered cost of ownership. We strive to provide the best in customer service and appreciate all feedback, both positive and negative, and will be using this as a coaching experience within the dealership. Should you wish to discuss this matter further, please contact our Customer Relations department at (800)965-8043 and a team member will be glad to assist.

So my experience at drive time today was long but it was so worth it. Jay, Naomi and Ken took excellent care of me the entire time i was here. They got me into a car with payments that i could afford and went the extra mile for my patience. I would highly recommend others here...oh and Jonathan is also a pleasure as well< /text>

Anybody knows buying a car is a long process that starts off enjoyable then ends up more work and energy than you had it mind. You quickly understand buying the car of your
dreams comes with some baggage. The car salesman and dealership have just as much effect on your purchase. What I'm trying to say is dealers and cars never match and it mite take you way longer than need be to get your dream car. I'm not a easy person to woe or bs. And when I call Victor Guerrero at DriveTime in west Covina I was ready to delegate hard. But he made it easy by getting to know me and really understand what I did and didn't want. He reassured me that he will get my dream car and the price I could afford. It took me a month and he did all the work by emailing and calling me every time he had something I might want. Well it worked and I got there and end up enjoying the whole vibe. Great sales team!! Victor Guerrero is your man to see. Trust in DriveTime.<//text>

Brad kiyomura did a wonderful job with helping me choose the vehicle, financing and explaining all the paper work. I appreciate all that he has done.

Disregard the above review. Drive time W. Covina and sales personnel isn't what I thought. Gave a review to someone who doesn't deserve it. If you want a car regardless of you credit make drive time your last and I do mean you last option. Wished I had made it mine. Be careful. Make sure the salesperson know about cars instead of a lemon.< /text>

After going from dealer to dealer trying to find someone who would be willing to work with me, I walked in to drive time a few days ago and with the help from Jesse and Diana we found a car I would like to drive off with and also knowing they where willing to work with me and get me into a car. And now today I can say I I'm happy and thankful to driving off  in a great looking car<//Text>

Had got the run around about buying a car from a lot of dealers but heard about drive time from my sister and won't ever look back. I left with a car and most importantly a transparent experience with no back doors or fine print. All thanks to Brad Kiyomura! Awesome dude! I'll be sending friends and fam your way!< /review>

Oh my gosh....I can't believe the great service my family received at drive time.!! We are a family of six an where in need of a bigger car.. And Jay helped us do just that..!! He put us in a nice family size van that me an my kids love..!! He took care of us from beginning to the end of the whole process..!! If your looking to buy or lease a car I highly suggest drive time.!! Ask for Jay he'll get you right..!!<//Review>

I don't have the best credit but they were able to get me in a better car then I had even hoped for! Marco was awesome and he made sure I was pleased from beginning to end.

Not only was the service great but it was quick too! The entire process took 2 1/2 hours tops and that's with me not getting pre-approved online.

I would diffidently refer all friends and family to the West Covina location and make sure they ask for Marco!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>Drivetime is awesome for people like me who don't have a substantial income for a high down payment and not the best credit. I was approved in minutes online for only a $200.00 down payment and monthly payment under $375.00. me and my sister both bought cars at the same time. When we went to the dealership to look at cars and sign the contracts we both were waiting for the catch, thinking the price would increase drastically or tell us we didn't qualify due to a technicality in our application. To our surprise there was no catch! They are true to what they advertise and are very helpful to get you into the car you want. They even picked up my car that was at another dealership 100 miles away. I drive for Lyft now and have sent many of my passengers in need of a car to apply on line and they do so in my back seat while I drive them to there destination. Like I said drivetime is awesome, especially at the West Covina branch. Go see Victor Guerrero, he went above and beyond to make my experience extremely gratifying.< /review>< user>

Sales agent Victor Guerrero helped me find the vehicle that was just right. He was very patient, knowledgeable and professional in his approach throughout the whole process; from phone calls to text messages over potential vehicles. I'd highly recommend speaking to him in your search to find at vehicle @ Drivetime in West Covina.< /Review>

Starting off I wasn't really feeling that the people at Drivetime were really interested in my wanting to purchase a vehicle but after sitting down with Jayson it was a wonderful experience in purchasing my 2016 Chevy Impala Jayson was very knowledgeable, and helpful and knew everything it was to know about the car I really appreciate that.

Thankyou Drivetime and especially Jayson great customer service!!!!!<//Text>

Diana and Candice were a great help. Getting the Jeep Commander took a while, but it was not their fault. The process was prolonged because of mechanical issues that needed to be fixed on the car. They can't sell you a vehicle unless it passes their inspection. Once it did, the process was done within an hour. Overall 5 star experience for a first time customer.<//review>

<Review>Brad Kiyomura is the best salesman Drivetime has at this location, I can bet he’s a better cars salesman at any other location. He’s patient, nice, cool, truthful, and he’s always 100% honest with his customers. I would like to refer him to anyone else who is looking to get a car.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80c32834de8738cf:0x11513752c372aa35< /gmapID><UserId.>109855166263481980600< /UserId.>< Name>

<review>I had a wonderful experience with Labri Melzer. I had been corresponding  with her while I was in the market for a car, and unlike every other sales person I came in contact with she never hounded or pestered or rushed me.  When I was finally ready to come in she was just as helpful in person and got me into a great car. Candice the sales manager was very pleasant and helpful as well. I will be referring any and all friends in the market for a used vehicle. The general atmosphere is very friendly and comfortable.</review><Response>None<//Response>< name>

This is the worst drive time ever they have no respect no compassion and they will rip you off trust me its not worth going to my husband is military and they were very rude to him and treated us like s*** I thought the customer is always supposed to be right or you're supposed to help them but apparently these dumbasses don't know what they're doing at this place because I went to another drive time and was very pleased the other Dr time got us into a car and even told my husband thank you for his service I'm sorry if you rip someone off in the military you're pretty low and they look like trash I thought car dealership places were supposed to look nice but I guess not< /review>

For my first car purchase Jessie was the most friendliest, helpful, very informative. He really made me feel at ease. Answering all my questions, he had complete patience with me. He was very professional I wouldnt mind buying another car from him! When you come down to the West Covina drive time ask for Jessie!<//review>

Boy, I have never been a nicer dealership in my life. You usually think you go into a dealership and get attached with promos and tryna get you to buy a car but this place didn't do ANY of that, I felt like I was in there with a couple of friends just looking at cars! Anyway I chose a very nice vehicle, they walked me through everything and talked me through the contract and ow much I was exactly paying and helped me above and beyond with getting the papers I needed to drive off the lot insured and everything inspected. During the test drive, Sally inspected everything with me and made sure everything worked properly and I just really loved there overall service. Thanks drivetime! I'll be coming here for my second car!< /text>

<Review>Both bri and Kevin provided great service, and overall the experience was great. My only complaints were they do not fill the tank or detail the car before delivering to the customer. I've bought 4 cars previous to this and never had that happen before. But overall I would recommend buying from drive time. The staff here at West Covina were very nice.<//Review><user_id>101057686566633573532<//user_id>< Pics>

<review>Diana Evangelista and Candice was real helpful. Although the car took a little time to get here. They stayed in contact with me following up on the progress of the Jèep. Diana and Candice were so polite and very professional. I was recommended by my god~daughter and everything that she told me about drive time was wonderful. Thank you very much drive time for your help this evening.</review><time>1455950235326<//time></record></dataset><record>

<review>Diana was wonderful! She helped me get into a great vehicle that was within my budget. There was absolutely no strong arm or high pressure sales which made this experience that much better. Diana is your girl.

Update:
I took my Chevy Equinox for an oil change and I find out that the 5000 mile oil cartridge had not been changed in over 20000 miles. I reached out to my sales rep to drivetime and I was passed on to the vehicle maintenance warranty company. I have to jump through hoops for a reimbursement. There were other maintenance tasks that should of been done as well. I am very disappointed. God knows what else they didnt do.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Bought a 2011 Camry here. Make sure to ask for Jesse, he really helped make the purchasing experience easy... Great staff all friendly and easy to work with, willing to answer any questions. I had a car transferred from the Torrence store, jesse picked it up him self and had it back at the store the same day. Deffentally a good experience. Took about an hour total after I knew which car I wanted...<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I needed to purchase a car for my wife so I went to Drive Time West Covina..Upon arriving my family and I were greeted by the Staff..Jerald and Candace helped make this big purchase easy. They were very nice, helpful and answered any questions or concerns we had..if you're looking to purchase a vehicle with friendly staff I recommend coming here to West Covina..< /Text>

<Text>After many months of searching for an SUV, I came to Drivetime after submitting my application online...and was helped by a young gentleman by the name of Jay J. Not only was this a great experience,  but there was no pressure and I was able to get the car that I wanted. Thanks Jay, and the rest of the Drivetime staff that assisted me...The customer service was excellent...warm, friendly and funny. This is the place to go when everyone else says "No" and your family has completely outgrown your compact car.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I recently purchased a car from DriveTime in West Covina.  My salesperson was Diana Delaney.  I have purchased many cars in the past and I have never had such a great experience.  It started from the moment we were greeted at the door.  I can still see her great smile.  She helped me pick the right car for me.  Thanks, Diana From Cynthia Longmire and daughter.<//Text>< Resp>

I was super nervous going into Drivetime not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Every step of the way Jerald was there walk me through the car buying experience. I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a great experience to talk to Jerald at Drivetime :)<//Text>

I did hours of research called many places and finally ended up choosing Drivetime the saleman convinced me to come doen, said he good give me a great deal “I Promise” he said went down spend another couple hours looking chose a car then after another hour of waitng the man comes back and says SORRY can’t help you !  I burst into tears he said my work history isnt long enough- well I am 20 and I have been a student ... I am married and my hisband owns his own comapny.  So why do they say on TV they.

my experience with Jerald and Ken at Drivetime Covina was the the best I've had out of any dealer I've been too. The staff is extremely courteous and was able to get me into the car I wanted. I'm going to refer my friends to them . You should go check them out :-)</Text>

My husband and I were in need of a new baby safe car after our recent addition to the family. We looked online at a very nice selection of vehicles, mainly the Kia Soul. We filled out a payment approval online and scheduled an appointment for the very next day. We arrived an hour early and were greeted by our sales woman, Labri, she was so great.
We sat down answered a few questions and we were given a list of approved vehicles. The Manager Jonathan is a dad, and is expecting another in May. He showed us the Sportage, he knows how parenting needs call for more space! We loved it and an hour later we left with a new car!
If you're looking for a fast, friendly, painless car buying experience I would recommend visiting DriveTime WC.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>This place is so terrible, instead of listening to my mother who is always right I made the choice to listen to them and boy was I wrong.
I went to trade in and purchase a vehicle, and at first they make you feel welcomed but when it came down to business they were savages. I had an 97' Lexus and they offered me $250 for trade in which in mine and KBB opinion is very low. So when it wasn't working for their benefit they brought up the trade in value to $500. First pisser offer.
Not to mention the sales associate Jay had no idea what he was talking about when offering my money back for purchasing insurance with them, I have insurance with USAA. I could have waited the following Monday to drive off in the car but he was insistent that I purchase the vehicle and I will be sure to get my money back. He was wrong, and it's not the first time.
So when I'm setting up payment plans I didn't bring in any voided checks so that they may set it up to my checking account, he advised me to go online and that he would be able to point out which one it was. Big mistake! The idiot wired it to my savings account and instead of receiving the payment, they didn't receive it and got charged with an insufficient fund fee. It was bogus! Instead of advising me to just call in the payment or pay online like a professional because he's not a banker and didn't know the difference it would have saved me a lot of trouble. I'm still to this day handling them and their sorry excuse for customer service. Where their representatives talk over you and are down right rude.
Before considering this place I would try a real dealership! Or even one of those run down used car dealerships you see on the corners of main streets! Please do not waste your time here you will be extremely disappointed.< /Review>< pictures>

we were interested in an SUV we saw online at Drive Time.We came to West Covina to see it and Ken Copsey was there to help us.we decided to look at a couple more cars and Ken even got us one from another Drive Time location to test drive. We chose a  Nice clean vehicle and we were qualified gently and quickly We are very happy with Ken"s style and service< /Review>

<text>I went in to drive time West Covina because over the phone they were the most polite. I got there and was greeted by Jessica Radogna and she helped me through the entire process. They took the time to find out my needs and even took the time to pull out several cars for me. I ended up getting the car I wanted and I could not be happier with my experience.<//text>< rate>

< Review>
So let's start from the beginning. I had been on the market for a car, and I'm gonna be honest. My credit score isn't the best and I needed more than just a credit card to help raise my score. Which I have also, just to clarify, but back to the point. I was looking at drivetime because I read online that you could get approved even if your credit score wasn't so great, so I decided to give it a shot. I did the online process and began to get some persistent calls from Bri, but I decided well if they are this persistent maybe I'll give it a chance. So I called Bri back at drivetime and she asked me if I was still on the market? Yes. And she asked if I was willing to go in that night to test drive? I was. So we went in, met Bri which by the way is the best sales person there. She's attentive, easy going, answers all your questions with no hesitation, isn't pushy in any way and just gives it to you like it is. I highly recommend her! She's amazing 😊

So we initially test drove one car, but the price for the down payment was just way out of our range and drivetime has this weird program that if the price ends in 7 it's a high down payment compared to when it ends in a 5. Ask them about it. So we had to compromise for another car, which I don't mind it's a great car and the process was long and tedious, but Bri and David the manager were amazing and did everything they could to help us off the lot in that car 🚗 So be aware if your thinking of getting a car from drivetime follow these steps:

1. Ask for Bri - trust me she's great 👍🏼
2. If you have a low credit score be prepared to have a down payment of at least 600-1600 depending on the car you want (oh! Also no matter if the car is better than the other, depending on how long it has been on the lot plays a big factor) but just be prepared!
3. If you don't already make sure to get all your pay stubs together for at least 3 months, but if you have a direct deposit then you don't have to worry about it. Bring a bill of some sort to prove proof of residence just in case.
4. BUY INSURANCE OR GET QUOTED BEFORE HAND. Saves a lot of time.
5. Be wary, if you have a low credit score your APR is going to be high. Like double digit high, but they recommend within 6 months - 1 year once your credit score is higher. That you refinance, which we will definitely be doing.
6. If they don't have the car you want, don't worry they get new cars all the time. So always check back, and if it's in the LA area they can get it transferred for you. Our car was in Montclair, and Bri herself went to go get it.

And that's all I have to say. All in all a great experience, I just have one gripe about the place and that's the women's restroom. It smells like old mildew, so that was not pleasant at all. 😰<//Review>

After hearing I needed $7000.00 down to buy a car at a big dealership and a monthly payment of 645.00 a month, I decided to see what Drivetime could do.
Diana Evangelista was patient, respectful, and helpful. Came in at 1100, by 230 we had a car for 750.00 down and 460.00 a month for a 2014 Chevrolet Captiva Crossover.  The experience was so smooth and professional with no pressure.
Thank you,
Diana</Review>

< Review>
I had a great experience a Drivetime West Covina. Jesse and Kenneth helped us out tremendously. They were patient, personable and helpful. I have absolutely no credit and I had been turned away from other dealerships but Drivetime was able to approve me right away and showed me a lot of different car options. I just bought a 2010 Honda Civic and I couldn't be happier. I recommend this place to anyone who has bad credit because they definitely will work with you. The most painless dealership experience I've had. Super easy process and I'm going home with a new car! Thanks Jesse :)< /Review>

These people are Great!!. I highly recommend them if you are considering buying a car and have less than perfect credit. Ask for Johnathen or Labri.</text>

Came here on a last minute appointment with Bri. Bri was very helpful and showed us three cars. Decided to get a 2014 Toyota Yaris with low mileage for a great price. Ken also helped us out with our financial situation. Both were very helpful :)</review>

Very helpful I would definitely refer anyone to them don't be afraid cause they are next to high end dealerships they are not CarMax either they have their own bank so they decide to qualify you and if you have bad to no credit they work with you as long as you have a job they will work with you I am very satisfied and very happy Labri is the associate that I worked with also the manager Ken very very helpful if you don't know about them go in and get your car this is my first time leasing a car with payments and they make is so convenient for you literally no stress I swear they are the best dealership around and should definitely be a top car place to go oh n fyi the building is very clean they have pop corn for the kids go check them out for real and be amazed the car collection will go fast tho so you gotta jump on what you want no matter what they make sure they work with you and that's what I love</text>

<review>I had the best experience today at Drivetime in West Covina. Bradley Kiyomura was super nice and helpful the whole way through. No hassel, no hidden fees or craziness. Walked off the lot the same day with exactly what I was looking for. All I can say is I wish I had known about this place sooner!<//review>< time>

<Review>Diana and Jesse were both professional and cortious when assisting me purchasing my car. In addition, Candice found a better deal than the 1st deal, and their combined efforts, you have an overly elated and satisfied customer. I will be referring friends to West Covina Drivetime.

So omg my experience here at Drive Time with Diana Evangelista was like fresh water on a hot cali day.  She was very patient and informative.  The store here was very clean and refreshments was provided.  Thanks again Diana for getting me into my first cur!!!! You go 👧.  If she can place me, she can place anyone.  Highly recomend this super 🌟 for you and for all of my future vehicle purchases.<//review>

I stumbled on to Drivetime only because they had the vehicle I was looking for.  I am glad I did, Diana Delaney at the West Covina store was absolutely fantastic at customer service, friendliness, and knowledge.  She did everything she could do to make the process simple.  That being said, the process was way too long!  I have bought many, many vehicles from dealers over the years and never spent the over 3 hours that I was at the dealer.  In summary, Diana was great, her manager was very slow, and the process was slow.  If you go to the West Covina store, make sure and ask for Diana!</text>

The application took less than 30 seconds and we were instantly approved.  We went to the West Covina location where Jayson took excellent care of us and catered to our every need (including our 1 and 5 year olds).  He even drove us to our job to get the employment verification paperwork signed today!  Now, we are driving off in our Hyundai Sonata and we love it!  If you're looking for the ultimate customer service experience,  low prices, and an easy financing process, come see Jayson at drivetime in West Covina!

<text>Jaymes helped us to purchase a car here, he was amazing...not pushy, didn't try to sell us, just listened to what we wanted and gave us that.  Great experience buying a car.  We originally went to Route 66 Motors in Glendora, what a huge mistake that was!  Never buy a car from that place.  At DriveTime, we got a good car it runs great and although the interest is on the high side it's worth it when getting what you actually want.  I don't feel like we got screwed on the deal, which is always a great feeling.  Also, the shop closed at 9pm and Jaymes and the underwriter Josh stayed there until midnight getting everything done so we could drive the car off the lot that night.  Great service, great people, and a good car to put the cherry on top!!!  I would absolutely recommend this place to get a car...even if your credit is bad they will help you, and they don't prey on people with bad credit like most buy here pay here places!  Thank you Josh.  Thank you Jaymes, and thank you DriveTime!!!  Great experience all around!!!</text>< pictures>

<review>You guys are lieing. This company is brutal. All week they had been telling me I didn't have to put any money down a car, and when I wenter to the dealership,  they tried to get me to put down $1300, but all week they had been telling me that I didn't have to put anything down. In addition,  when I arrived at the DS, the car that I wanted to purchase was broken down in one of their shops in a different location.

They had been telling me all week that the car was at my preferred DS in Torrance. Nothing,  but a bait&switch game. Screw you DriveTime.<//review>< pictures>

{'time': 1466096091906, 'text': 'Hello Dale – I appreciate you taking the time to let us know about your concerns with DriveTime. I received and responded to your previous review for our Torrance dealership and am sincerely sorry that we were previously unable to meet your requests. Prior to sale every vehicle is subject to a multipoint inspection to ensure it meets or exceeds national safety standard. However, with pre-owned vehicles sometimes issues may arise after inspection that we are unable to predict. To ensure reliability of our vehicles, after they are transported to our lots they are taken on frequent test drives. Should any issues arise during a test drive, we are required to address it prior to releasing it to any customer. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this matter caused. Regarding your concern on approval, it is our goal to assist people with little credit, no credit, or bad credit to find affordable vehicles with finance terms that they can successfully maintain. For this reason, our approval process differs from that of other dealerships. While we strive to provide accurate pre-approval information prior to visiting our dealership, we are not always able to do so successfully. This is because final approval and down payment are subject to vehicle selection, as well as verification of the documents our customer provides. As a result, what is quoted during the pre-approval process may differ from final approval, as it is subject to the information we receive. Should anything change, or new information can be provided, we would be happy to reevaluate what you qualify for. I apologize for any frustrations this matter caused, but I hope you will still consider us in the future. Respectfully – Natalie |Customer Relations'}</response>

When we entered we were greeted by Diana Delaney who always kept a smile and did not miss a beat. She allowed us the time to walk through and search for a vehicle without making us feel pressured. While signing the application she totally blew me away when she offered my beautiful girlfriend some ceviche tostadas, she walked over a few minutes later with the tostadas and a few hours later we drove off in a 2004 Ford Explorer. Highly would recommend Drive Time in West Covina< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've always dreaded going to a dealership in general because everybody usually makes you feel like you can't get out of the place without buying a vehicle. DriveTime West Covina is an exemption. I came in from LA to check out a replacement vehicle at aorund 7 pm (which is so late). I was immediately entertained by Diana who offered me drinks and snacks, I was told that I qualified for 2 options which were to purchase or lease a vehicle. I told Diana that I dont have much money for a down but she said that they could make it happen for $995 down even with the credit I had.

My Drivetime experience has been so awesome thanks to Diana and Joshua.

Thank you so much I will definitely be referring my friends to this dealership :D</Review>

Diana Delaney was the best sale person I have ever met, Diana  was very helpful and friendly,  Joshua Alavrez was very knowledgeable and also helpful.  If you go to drive time West Covina see Diana Delaney and tell her you know Alex Lujan😎😎<//Text><user_name>Lori & Alex Lujan<//user_name>< Pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>This Place is the Worst for service, me and my Fiance got a car this month, and already there's problems. The car broke down on the freeway and they didn't help.

They keep pushing avrex like their the best, my own insurance company gave me more options than them, they lag on the phones, they sound sympathetic when their not.

Avoid Drivetime like the plague they'll just take your money and tell you to call AVREX AVREX AVREX, sounds like they need to change their name to AVREX. This post is a true statement not only from me, but my Fiance, my Mother,Grandfather, my Finances parent's, everyone says don't trust them.

If your ever thinking about drivetime, think of this first, do you want crappy service ? Do you want your money stolen ? Do you like to be lied to ? Well choose Drivetime, "Their The Best" NOT !!!!!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Amazing. IM WRITING THIS REVIEW IN ALL CAPS SO THAT YOU (POTENTIAL CUSTOMER) PAYS FULL ATTENTION TO THIS REVIEW. I CANNOT PUT INTO WORDS THE ABSOLUTE STELLAR EXPERIENCE I HAD WORKING WITH KENNETH. HE WAS HONEST AND HARD WORKING. HIS SHIFT ENDED AT 6PM AND I WAS UNABLE TO SHOW UP UNTILL 7, HE WAITED FOR ME AND SENT ME HOME IN AN AMAZING VEHICLE . KEN IF YOU READ THIS, YOU ARE THE MAN, I HOPE YOU WIN THE LOTTERY OR DEVELOP SUPERPOWERS BEYOND THE ONES YOU ALREADY HAVE... TO ALL READERS: IF YOU WANT A NEW CAR THAT IS AWESOME THEN I HIGHLY RECONMEND YOU TO KENNETH AT DRIVE TIME WEST COVINA . LASTLY THE FINANCIAL GUY JOSH WAS JUST AS HELPFUL RIGHT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULDENT HAPPEN...HE MADE IT HAPPEN. MY NAME IS ZANE ABDELATIF AND I AM A REAL AND SATISFIED DRIVE TIME CUSTOMER<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Cecillia the sales rep and Josua the manager was nothing but excellent in helping us get into the right vehicle for our family of 4 (soon to be 5). Cecillia is a very hard worker. At first we left the lot with a Chevy Equinox, but decided over night that it wasn't going to cut it wit 3 boys in the back (ages 4-newborn) we needed more space. So after looking on the inventory in the surrounding areas, i came across a very nice Toyota Seinna that i wanted to check out. Cecillia drove all the way down to Downey to pick it up for us n brought it back to her West Covina location. Super helpful. I recommend this place to anyone looking to get into a new car. Thank you DriveTime.</Review>< pics>

{'time': 1521213589117, 'text': 'Hello Allen, Thank you for providing feedback and I apologize that your experience with us was less than perfect. Please know that all of our vehicles are inspected prior to sale to prevent mechanical  concerns. The vehicles sold from DriveTime are pre-owned and as a result there are times where mechanical concerns may arise post-sale. For this reason every vehicle sold from DriveTime comes with a 30-day/1,500-mile Limited Warranty, along with the optional  Vehicle Service Contract, to assist in these situations. In addition,  DriveTime and Bridgecrest (our loan servicing company) work with customers who have less than perfect credit. This can cause the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) offered to be a bit higher than expected. For this reason, we provide a Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure during the contracting process. This disclosure details the APR, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total amount expected to be paid throughout the life of the loan, and the total sales price. If you have any questions regarding this information please contact my team, Customer Relations, at (888)-290-0148 and we can discuss this information further. Thank You, Jodi-Customer Relations'}< /Response>

{'time': 1478209532269, 'text': 'Hello Athena - Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, I appreciate the opportunity to address the concerns you have brought forth. While I am happy to hear you had a great experience at our West Covina location but am deeply sorry to hear of the issues that have taken place since. We never wish for our customers to experience issues, especially so shortly after purchase. We take every measure available prior to sale, including inspection and test drives, to ensure our vehicles will be reliable for our customers. However, we know that it is not possible to predict the future behavior of any given vehicle and we want our customers to know we are here to support them if ever the need arises. In addition to the warranty options we make available at the time of sale, my department exists as an added support to review for assistance in extenuating circumstances. In order to best address your specific concerns, I would like to speak with you directly to gain a better understanding of what issues have taken place. I will be reaching out to you within the next 24-48 business hours to discuss. Should you be in need of immediate assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to my department, Customer Relations, at 888-290-0148. I thank you again for your time and for bringing this to our attention. I look forward to speaking with you soon in hopes to turning this matter around and restoring your views of DriveTime. Have a wonderful day. Respectfully - Natalie | Customer Relations'}< /response>

{'time': 1519403246200, 'text': 'Hello Maria, Thank you for taking the time to rate your DriveTime experience. I do apologize your that interaction with us has been less than perfect, along with your sales experience. We truly appreciate your feedback and will be addressing with the appropriate department.  I want to assure you that we strive to provide only the best in customer service. Please know that DriveTime and Bridgecrest (our loan servicing company) work with customers who have less than perfect credit. This can cause the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) offered to be a bit higher than expected. For this reason, we provide a Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure during the contracting process. This disclosure details the APR, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total amount expected to be paid throughout the life of the loan, and the total sales price. In addition, all of our vehicles are inspected prior to sale. However, vehicles sold from DriveTime are pre-owned and as a result, there may be instances where mechanical concerns may arise post sale. For this reason, every vehicle sold from DriveTime comes with a 30 day/1,500 mile limited warranty as well as a 5 day/300 mile return policy for added peace of mind. To best assist, please contact my team, Customer Relations, at (888)290-0148. Thank You,Jodi-Customer Relations'}</resp>
