All of the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and are happy to explain if you’re confused. Dr. Irvin in particular is the best! He is so outgoing and surprisingly he remembers all the small conversations we had.

Overall, if you are looking for a quality dental office, East West Dental is the place for you!!</review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2c554c4f2dc47:0xc7fb77085a163258<//gmapID></record>

I’ve been coming here for years & they have continued to provide great service!! They were professional, helpful, and nice! They did their job until the end or even more & made sure everything was good afterwards. I felt that they genuinely cared because they wanted to do their best.

In addition, Dr. Irvin was friendly, patient and considerate. He provided & made adjustments or suggested changes/options to whatever that would leave me satisfied without even me having to ask, which was great. He knows what he’s doing and goes beyond expectations by taking time to also explain things clearly and answer questions if there’s any despite how busy it gets! Everyone else was also good as well, they also made sure they kept the place clean and safe!< /Text>

I hardly ever spend time in the waiting room and get seated inside fairly quickly for all my appointments.  Their staff is very friendly and make an effort to get to know me.  I've only had experience with a few of their dentists and all were kind and efficient.  They took the time to make sure I was numb and listened to when I needed to make adjustments.  The assistants had a good rapport with the dentists and seemed to do a good job anticipating/listening to commands.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Chen for children.< /Text>

Best dental practice around!! I was so worried about going back to the dentist after years of not going. Dr Irwin Kaw was seriously amazing! Not only was he super helpful in explaining everything - but I also appreciated his more conservative approach to how to handle my teeth! Lovely staff and facility. This will be my go to dentist for now on!!< /review>

This place is great! I've been coming here for the past 15+ years, their staff is really kind and helpful. They are also really gentle while doing deep teeth cleaning. Dr. Irvin Kaw is the best dentist ever; I trust his advice. He's also so cheerful and helpful! Love this place. I can't imagine going to another dental place and getting the same treatment. I highly recommend this place, especially if you have children; I've been coming here since I was a kid with my parents, that's probably why I enjoy coming because the staff is lovely.</Text>

<text>Dr. Irvin and his team are incredible. Dr. Irvin priorities patient education and engagement and genuinely cares about his patients and staff.

I still remember visiting for the first time 5 years ago -- Dr. Irvin was warm and welcoming and he proactively gave an overview of the visit, educated me on the various procedures he was doing and provided detailed and easy to understand recommendations to improve my oral hygiene. It left a lasting impression and he still does this for all of our visits.

You are in great hands with Dr. Irvin!<//text>< Resp>

<review>I've been coming back to this dental place because of Dr. Irvin Kaw. He is super helpful and friendly! You don't just go there for teeth cleaning, he actually sits down with you to go over any concerns that you may have on any areas of your mouth and provide advice. He also doesn't rush you. He listens so I appreciate that. I highly recommend this place. It's clean while the staff is very nice and organized. The parking area is big enough. If there is no parking, you can park around the residential area. I am always able to find parking there and just have to walk for a little bit. Overall, I recommend this place especially if you have kids. It's getting better and better. :D</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Been coming here for the last 10+ years and for good reason. Everyone has always been really nice to me and that’s been consistent ever since I first started going to them. I always have good conversations with everyone there and the dental care is too notch! The professionals there got graceful hands that minimize potential pain and that’s always a plus. Highly recommended for all your dental care needs!<//text>

<Review>The staff at East West Dental is extremely welcoming. Unlike other dentists I've tried in the past, the staff here do not actively try to make you feel bad when there's something wrong with your teeth. Instead, they do their best to be understanding and try to help you fix the problem, as opposed to actively blaming you for the problem. 10/10<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2c554c4f2dc47:0xc7fb77085a163258< /GmapID><Date>1622942392607<//Date></record>

Excellent service here and they really care about their patient. I have been with east west dental for more than 5 years. I and my brother do all my dental care here as well as our braces. Dr. Irvin is a great dentist with very friendly personality. I’m the kind of patient with tons of questions. Dr. Irvin and the nurses always answer them patiently. Dr. Lee is also very good at what he do. He removed my wisdom teeth, it went smooth and I healed great.<//Review>

Dr Ervin himself was even more impressive: after analyzing the issues and offering the possible solutions, he further explained what he thought my senior mother would need and what to skip fixing, with detailed explanation.

That was a lot of patience and efforts on his part, as our previous visit to 2 other clinics would throw us an estimate (without explanation) and then spent all their efforts into making (kind of almost "forcing") my mother to have as much work done as possible.

I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who expects an honest opinion on what benefits YOU, instead of someone else.<//Text>< response>

The staff are really nice and friendly. During covid you will see that they thoroughly clean each room after each treatment. I was able to get my filling quickly and smoothly without feeling any pain. They numb you and check on you to ask if it has kicked in to make sure you feel comfortable.

East west dental is very accommodating and treat you very well. It feels like they have a stake in your care and genuinely care. Been going here for a while with my whole family and we couldn't be happier with the care provided.

All the doctors and staff here are very professional and treat you with respect. Making an appointment is very easy as well and they always answer your call. Even during covid they make sure their offices are safe for everyone and take all the necessary safety precautions. Beyond that the pricing is very fair and the care you receive is top quality, I would recommend east west dental to everyone!< /Review>

I have been here for couple of times since last December for doing different kinds of treatment ( first come to do teeth cleaning and then come to deal with different levels of cavity issue). I really appreciate Dr. 張（Chang?) ‘s patience and hard work in terms of fixing my cavity and make them look really great (and healthy)! Due to challenged angles of my teeth, it really takes them a lot of work and energy to fix my “problem”. Dr. Chang’s assistant also knows very well how to assist him in a great way. I also like how the the team collaborate closely with Dr. Hsu to discuss my case and provide the best service they can to me. Definitely will recommend this place to more people. I got recommended by seeing other people’s reviews and I hope my review helps you too!<//Review>

Friendly staff and doctors! Dr. Irvin spends much time with his patients and cares for their well being. He works within your budget as well taking into account your own dental plans and can see his dedication to this field. The doctors are gentle with your teeth yet quick and precise with the task at hand.

Highly recommend the office had fresh air circulating and followed COVID guideline procedures, people waited in the car after temperature scanning and the chairs and equipment were newly sanitized and clean.<//review>

Awesome service! My tooth was hurting but my regular dentist office has limited service during COVID, so my husband recommended me to come to EWD. They took the X-Ray and did thorough analysis and noticed my tooth was fractured. Doctor was able to fix it and suggested that I wear a night guard as a preventive measure. Staffs and doctors here are all nice, and I would definitely recommend coming here.<//Text>

<text>My family and I have been going to East West Dental for over 10 years since I was a little kid. I have never been scared to go to the dentist because the entire staff is extremely kind and helpful with anything we need. Dr. Irvin really cares about his patients and goes above and beyond to explain every detail about what is going on and what needs to be done. He is also very considerate because he does not make people do extra procedures and pay extra money if it is not needed. He is very intelligent and can tell you if you are low risk or high risk for anything and what you can expect in the future. His team is dedicated to taking care of their patients, and they treat everyone with respect and kindness. They also have a very safe procedure and take all necessary precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. I highly recommend going to East West Dental whether it is for regular checkup, deep cleaning, dental surgeries, or even getting braces. I can guarantee that you will have an excellent experience!<//text>< Pics>

I have been coming to East West Dental since I was a little girl, for over 14 years! They have never failed to offer such incredible service. When I walk in it feels like I am being welcomed by friends every time! They are very accommodating and have made me feel extremely satisfied with my smile. Dr. Irvin saw the troubles I was facing and insecurities I have been struggling with for a very long time, and gave me so many options to help fix my teeth. The receptionist knew who I was the moment I walked into the door and has always been very kind to me. I love this place and would give it more stars if I could!!</Review>

Caring and friendly staff with very safe COVID-19 protocols. The doctors here are not only top notch but also care about your oral health and will do everything in their abilities to help you with your problems. This clinic is the closest you'll get to a true "family dentist."</Review>

<Text>My daughter has been here for dental care for 5 years, even we move from LA to riverside, she still chooses to come back here.  Every doctor and staff here are very friendly, they understand many languages, because my English is not good, but they will explain to me in detail. Thank you.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< user>

<Text>Terrific service as always by Dr. Kaw and crew. Can't say enough excellent things about this local dental practice in the Southland Los Angeles area.

The staff practitioners are kind, patient, and are fluent in English, Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese), and Burmese. Please give them a try, you will not be disappointed with the Top notch service. Go team East-West Dental! A+++</Text>< Pictures>

I trust East West Dental with my teeth. Their care and transparency are why I keep on coming back here. When it comes to finding the right place for anything, I look for commitment, transparency, and professionalism. East West meets all of these attributes and more. Everyone is very kind and attentive and willing to answer any of my questions. I started coming here just for cleaning but then decided to do braces with them. I was able to get the braces on and off within 2 years. Despite the pandemic, they still made sure that I had enough rubber bands and also kept me updated when I would be able to come in and get my braces off (under COVID protocols of course). I highly recommend this dental office. Dr. Irvin Kaw is also really cool.< /Review>

<text>East West Dental is the best dental office in the 626 area, hands down! I’ve been coming here for over 10 years and I also got my braces done here. I’ve always had a great experience which is why my entire family and boyfriend comes here too. Dr. Irvin is honestly the best and his entire staff is all very kind and caring professionals. Before any procedures, Dr Irvin always carefully explains everything thoroughly so that I know what’s going on. He really cares about your dental health and helps prepares you. No complaints here.

I highly recommend this dental office! There’s a reason why I’ve been coming here for so many years and pricing is fair! You won’t be disappointed. :)</text>< pics>

Conclusion: Would recommend to everyone looking for a dentist that they can trust and be very transparent. They were able to educate me on what they saw, what needed to be done, and what I needed to work on in the future for prevention. I appreciate the time and effort in answering all my questions and working with me on a plan that we can all agree on would be best for my dental health.

Concerned about COVID? (because really who isn't)
They take proper sanitization of rooms very seriously. The staff made me feel like my safety was their top priority. I appreciate the effort because limiting exposure is my goal, especially during times like these.< /Text>

Despite the fact that COVID has been looming around for almost a year, the staff management are always hard workers who strive to make everyone’s lives better. They are extremely efficient in terms of how they take precautions in this pandemic. One thing that really stands out to be the most is how everyone in the facility is friendly and courteous. It was simply top notch customer service. They’ve always been honest with me.The front office are always willing to answer any questions. Not only that, it’s a place I want to go every time to get my teeth clean. Everyone in the staff offers so much inclusive advices when it comes down to how to improve your dental hygiene. I’ve never been more impressed by the doctors there who offer me every advices and steps of the way to get to where I am now. I feel extremely treasured and valued from here.< /Text>< Date>

Like most people, I dread to go to the dental office. Up until about 3 to 4 years ago, I would only go to the dental office when I had toothaches and I wouldn't even get my annual/semi-annual cleaning. Yes, I know my personal hygiene wasn't the greatest but I had unpleasant experiences with different dentists and I just hated to go!

Dr. Chang totally changed that for me, when I first met Dr. Chang about 3 to 4 years ago, my cavities were so bad but I barely felt a thing. Dr. Chang was and still is very gentle and extremely knowledgeable! She would think of ways to make her patients feel the least amount of pain and would go above and beyond to save her patients' teeth! Unlike most dental offices that usually recommend unnecessary procedures,  Dr. Chang from East West Dental only recommends what you actually need to get done, and nothing more! She genuinely cares about her patients!

The nurses and medical staffs at East West Dental are great too!< /review>< GmapID>

Great precaution has been taken during the pandemic to ensure everyone’s safety is of upmost priority. Prescreening forms are filled before every visit and temperature checks are taken by two modes. The office is spotless and modern. Dr. Irving is a consummate professional who is concise, thorough when explaining procedures needed, and works with your budget. The biggest differentiation for me, is the honesty Dr. Irving consults.  Dr. Lee is a specialist that has a soft touch. He also is great to converse with and makes  you feel at ease. Overall, the entire support staff is extremely friendly and offers superb customer service. Great value for exceptional quality care, I highly recommend East West Dental.</review>

<Text>I called for an appointment and was able to get one the same week. When I got there, they had several covid-19 precautions including rinsing my mouth with mouthwash.

Not only are they very professional but they are all very personable and friendly. It is great to be able to connect and communicate with all the dentists and staff at this facility. Dr. Irvine is always very informative and friendly, so that is always a plus to a great dental office!

I recently noticed that they have this crazy big machine that cleans and purifies each room and have many different safety procedures in place. I'd definitely come back knowing that this place is well cleansed and maintained.

I have coming to this dental office for over ten years (for braces and overall oral care) and I have NEVER had a bad experience. The staff is so friendly and accommodating, I have never felt the need to look for another dentist. I keep returning because of their approach and methodology to dental health. It is always about preventative care and the prioritization of your oral hygiene. They have never been pushy about having all of my teeth filled (I have a number of cavities..) but have always suggested me to monitor the cavities and to have them filled once every fiscal quarter, therefore alleviating some financial burden. What I am trying to say is, this dental office cares about their patients and I will continue to return to East West Dental.

They cater to english as well as non-english speakers. I believe the office has the capacity for Cantonese, Mandarin and Burmese (I think).

Also with the COVID pandemic, I had been weary about having my teeth cleaned but those fears settled as soon as I saw the precautionary measures they had in place.<//review>

<text>This office has been treating me for fillings and two root canals, and after being scared of the dentist for my entire life, they have brought me comfort and confidence in returning again and again.

Dr. Irvin is patient and precise in his work, and he is attentive to feedback and signals to pain, which he will alleviate. He takes a conservative approach to apply necessary treatments, and he lays out and explains options that I may take into consideration. I highly recommend anyone who is scared of dentists to see Dr. Irvin. If I had not seen him, my dental health would most definitely suffer more.<//text><rate>5< /rate>< Pictures>

I've been a patient of Dr. Kaw for years. Even though it's now become quite a trek, I still continue to come to him because he really listens. I appreciate that he takes the time to explain things to me in a factual, non-judge-y way. When he presents treatment options, he will also give his recommendations depending on how aggressively I'd like to tackle the problem. I've had to have an in-person visit since the pandemic, and was very impressed with the measures he's taken to ensure the health and safety of his patients and staff. I really like supporting employers that take care of their people, and Dr. Kaw seems to do just that. Everyone on his staff appeared to be in full compliance with COVID-19 measures which gave me great confidence that they would help me be safe as well.

I'd like to give a shoutout to Dr. Han. Like most people, I get nervous going to the dentist. Dr. Han, who did my cleaning on two different occasions, had such a steady hand and reassuring manner, I was way less tense than I usually am during this procedure.</Review>

I've had braces, wisdom teeth removals, and majority preventive care services here and fully trust the team with my teeth. Dr. Irvin is VERY knowledgeable and the staff is very caring and patient. They're very comforting for those who have dental anxiety and always share what they will be doing in the procedure (if it helps you) so that you won't be alarmed and worried about what is happening.

The only common downside of this practice is the wait time, but it makes a lot of sense for the amount of attention the staff show for their patients. They advise you on how to continue to care for your teeth and show that they genuinely are concerned. They're very transparent with their job and it never feels like they're doing it just for a profit.

The practice's COVID measures have been very strict as they are properly cleaning the office and in between each patient to ensure the staff and patients are safe.

Again, I would highly recommend this dental office and apologize for the long review. There's definitely too many good things to share about this place :)<//Text><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Recommend! Very friendly, welcoming, caring and professional staffs. They are amazing. We been with them over 10 years+. Dentists are very educated and willing to take time to explain dental care/health to me. Also, they have orthodontist next to dentist office. I started my brace process 11/ 2019 and still going to my dentist appts and braces appts even though during the pandemic/Covid period. They are very clean and safe. They take precaution very seriously during Covid. When you arrive, you need to call them and do an online survey, then someone comes to take vital and temperature before entering. Super safe. RECOMMEND!! I trust them!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I have been coming to this office for over two years and love my experience here. Dr. Irvin and his staff are all very professional and friendly. They have taken great measures to ensure our safety during COVID-19 with temperature and heart rate checks, questionnaires, hand sanitizers readily available, having very powerful air filters, and mouth rinses. I very safe and comfortable for all my visits.<//Review>

I went in because my wisdom tooth was bothering me.  There was many patient rooms and they are good with staying on time with my appointment.  I then had a x-ray of the area that was bothering me and was explained why I was feeling the pain.  I then requested to have my wisdom tooth extracted.  The procedure was pretty fast and Dr. Irvin Kaw was very skilled at what he was doing making the extraction as painless as possible.  I am very glad that he helped me.  I would totally recommend the place. 😁<//Text>

Where do I start? I had initially taken my nephew and niece to this place and we have been patients for over 10 years. It was recommended by my cousin. Nothing like old school word of mouth recommendations. Every time someone tells me they need a dental place I refer them to this place. The staff are so nice and helpful! the first time I went I was overwhelmed with my nephew’s complex case, but with their help everything turned out perfect and they guided us so it would be an easy transition... Once I got insurance through my employer I knew where I wanted to go to get my dental check ups. I was relieved that they were so knowledgeable in regards of their claims and keeping up with your deductibles and fees! All the doctors are very knowledgeable and Dr. Irvin is very nice! I was surprised the staff remembers my name!!! They accept insurance; just call and ask. They would provide you with all the information. And if you don’t have insurance their prices are fair; I referred a friend and the cost at East West Dental was 2-3 times cheaper than the once she was offered initially somewhere else... Also, they have an ortho side, which makes everything so much easier!! Go to East West Dental and you won’t be afraid to visit dentists anymore!

COVID precautions: they have an air filter in every room. The ortho side has all doors open for good air flow. Everyone wears a mask and gloves. Additionally, the people that need to be close to you wear face shields. You need to rinse with mouthwash before you are seen by a doctor. Temperature and pulse check at the entrance. Also, you need to complete a survey, if you are a continuous patient you can wait in the car so they can text you the form and tell you it’s ok to go in. I feel very safe in their environment.</Text>

<Review>I’ve been going here since I was in the first grade. Not a scary place as a kid. My dentist, Dr. Irvin remembers everyone and really treats you well. And personally I think it’s important to have a doctors that I can have that kind of relationship with. I was looking at the one star reviews and they’re all about pricing. And let’s be honest that’s a problem with the health care system not the dentist office. Go vote.</Review>< rating>

<Review>I have been coming to this practice for 2 years and it's been a great experience every time​. From having a deep cleaning, filling my cavities, and extracting my ​wisdom tooth, the assistants and doctors made sure that I was comfortable and relaxed the entire time. They really know how to treat and care for their patients at this office. They explain the procedure to you very well so you know what you're getting into and you don't feel pressured.

I visited them for my cleaning this Monday during the pandemic. They are taking the right precautions as an office to make sure everyone is safe. You text/call the office when you arrive and they send you a survey to fill out to make sure you don't have any symptoms before they ask you to come in the waiting room which is empty.

The assistants have you rinse your mouth twice with a ​mouth rinse before taking your x-rays and they've also installed special filters in every single room in the office to minimize the spread of aerosols.<//Review>< date>

Dr Irvin takes no short cuts in providing the best teeth care, he explains in extraordinary detail on the processes of what he plans to do on your teeth and shows before and after pictures. No complaints and the staff are incredibly friendly.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I was referred to Dr. Irvin by my fiance and I couldn't be happier because he's my kind of doctor!  Dr. Irvin is very personable, considerate, funny, and very informative.  I'm the type of person that likes to ask a lot of questions and Dr. Irvin does a great job explaining his procedures, my conditions, and also provides excellent recommendations on how to improve your dental health.  I enjoy the amazing dental care he provides me and my fiance, and I don't expect it to be any different with any other patient that sits in his chair.  I highly recommend going to East West Dental and be sure to ask for Dr. Irvin!</text>< pictures>

Literally the best dental practice I've ever been in. I gave this place a try because my dentist doesn't open on Saturdays and I had some sensitivity with one of my left tooth. After the visit my tooth is now sensitive free. All of the ladies were friendly, accommodating, and showed genuine interest in serving my needs. Highly recommended and I'll absolutely be back.< /Text>

He is easy going and has always provided me with impactful information to properly care for my teeth. He never fails to account for the all the options and procedures that I can take to care for my teeth which allows me to determine which route is best for me. He doesn't pressure you to go through procedures if it's not necessary, and this helps my wallet.

Dr. Irvin at East West Dental is an excellent dentist.  He is friendly, knowledgeable and caring.

I have been going to East West Dental for many years now.  The staff are nice and friendly.  My experience with Dr. Irvin has always been great.  He has helped me on many occasions since my case is a bit more complicated.  He takes the time to explain the situation and give recommendations on how to best proceed.  That’s very important to me.  He also taught me how to take care of my teeth and the importance of dental care.  Before where as I would go to the dentist when I had a problem, now I go regularly to keep my teeth clean and healthy.  I liked Dr. Irvin so much that I recommended him to my mom.  She has been going to him for awhile now too and her teeth are now cleaner and healthier .  I’ve also seen Dr. Chiang.  She’s great too.  Really nice, knowledgeable and caring.

Great experiences.  I highly recommend East West Dental!</Text>

< Review>
Too bad, on January 18, 2019, the general cleaning of the teeth and the comprehensive dental examination, the doctor is extremely unresponsible, and checking the teeth is like walking. It caused me to crack my teeth a month later, and asked him to negotiate. Dr. Xu said that we were not wrong, and pushed the responsibility. The alarm is also useless, and it is useful to find a lawyer. Standard Chinese lie to Chinese people's money! How can there be medical ethics, live liar, and deceived dentists!<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Dr. Xu and his team have proved their professionalism with practical actions, always put the needs of patients in the first place, and take care of patients' dental health wholeheartedly. With their superb professional knowledge, good service attitude, elegant medical environment, accurate and meticulous grasp of patients' medical records, and my good medical experience every three years, Dr. Xu is especially recommended.

In addition, I share a tip for keeping teeth healthy: because I like to show my smile to others, I need to pay more attention to oral and dental health, so that I can show others the most elegant smile. This is inseparable from the daily meticulous care of the teeth, but also the regular examination by a team of professional doctors. Everyone can have such a team of professional doctors: Dr. Xu Dental.

I wish you all take off your masks as soon as possible and show your elegant smile to more people ^_^

许医生及他的团队用实际行动证明了他们的专业性，始终把患者需求放在第一位，全心全意为患者牙齿健康着想。他们精湛的专业知识，良好的服务态度，优雅的就医环境，对患者病历的精确细致把握，以及我三年来每次良好的就诊体验，在此特别推荐许医生。

另外分享一个保持牙齿健康的小窍门：因为我喜欢把自己的微笑展现给别人，所以更需要注重口腔牙齿健康，从而可以展现给别人最优雅的微笑。这既离不开自己日常对牙齿的精心护理，同时也离不开专业医生团队的定期检查，大家都可以拥有这样的专业医生团队：许医生牙科。

祝大家早日摘下口罩，把自己优雅的微笑展示给更多人 ^_^< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The doctors are very friendly and kind, as are the dental assistants. Although there is time to wait, the relevant personnel greet and explain the process from time to time, and I know what the next step is. I learned my homework today. After washing my teeth, I was told that the way I flossed and rinsed my teeth was incorrect. These things I did every day turned out to be a thousand miles away (if I did it, I didn’t do it). The staff’s patient and entity teaching is much clearer than what I have heard before and the videos I watched on the Internet. Because of the epidemic, I don't want to go out. Today's itinerary is worth the fare.

医生都很有友善亲切，牙医助理也是。虽然有等待的时候，但相关人员不时的问候与交待过程，我知道下一步是什么。今天我学了功课。洗牙后，我被告知我用牙线和涮牙的方式不正确，这些我每天都做的事原来失之毫厘，谬以千里（我有做等于没做）。工作人员耐心实体的教导比以前我听过的话和网上看的影片清楚明白多了。疫情关系，不愿出门，今天的行程值回票价了。</Review>< pics>

I had a severe toothache. I saw several clinics and told me that I wanted to remove it. Later, I was introduced by a friend to Dr. Xu. Dr. Xu patiently explained that as long as it can be saved, it cannot be removed. I got my teeth repaired for a small amount of money, and it has been more than a year without any problems. Thank you Dr. Xu and his team very much.

我要感謝許醫師高超技術以及愛心，為病人著想，挽救了我的牙齒。我有一顆牙痛的很厲害，看了幾家診所都說要拔掉，後來經朋友介紹找到許醫師。許醫師耐心解釋，只要能救就不能拔掉。花了很少錢就把我的牙齒補好了，到現在已經一年多了沒有任何問題。非常感謝許醫師和他的團隊。< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

今天我是為了去做補牙(補蛀洞)，他們的診所各種安全措施都做得很徹底(如醫療用空氣清淨機、每看完一位病人就會對診間進行消毒、他們所戴的口罩以及防護衣也是每天都會替換) 讓我對於來到這裡治療牙齒感到非常安心。Dr.Irvin 人非常親切而且也很專業，我非常推薦各位來East West dental !<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I am very grateful to Dr. Xu for patiently filling my teeth. The technique is very good. After the filling, it feels like my own. The teacher of the dental cleaning service is gentle and has always been afraid of washing, so my teeth have not been blocked in a long time. They cleaned me very cleanly, and they were very patient. In order to completely protect my teeth, I think I will come back soon.

很感谢许医生耐心为我补了牙齿，技术很好，补好以后感觉像我自己长的一样。洗牙的师傅服务温和，一直害怕洗牙，所以我的牙齿很久没冼了很多阻牙，他们帮我洗得很干净，而且特别有耐心。为了彻底保护好我牙齿，我想我很快会再回来。</review>

<user>106890002014848849856< /user><review>(Translated by Google) Recommended by a friend! I met several unreliable dentists before, which caused me to have a very big shadow of dentists! But not only is the front desk staff very friendly here at Dentist Xu (I have the most contact with Connie! Praise her by real name!) and Dr. Xu is also very friendly and the technology is super good! ! ! They will give you the treatment plan that your teeth need most! It’s not to make money to make money, I can feel that they are really thinking about you and regretting that they didn’t come to Dr. Xu earlier so that I don’t have to suffer so much before. I am a very picky person, but I can’t enjoy everything I can enjoy with Dr. Xu. Be picky (except that the waiting time is a bit long but it is understandable and worth it!) If you are still confused to choose a dentist! Dr. Xu is definitely the first choice here! I will continue to receive treatment with Dr. Xu from now on. Thank you to every staff member of this clinic ❤️

朋友推荐的！之前遇到了好几个不靠谱的牙医 导致我对牙医有非常大的阴影！但是许牙医这里不光前台工作人员非常友善（我和connie接触最多！实名表扬她！） 而且许医生也非常友善之外技术还超级好！！！他们都会给你关于你牙齿最需要的治疗方案！不是为了赚钱而赚钱 能感觉出来他们真的在为你着想 后悔没有早点来找许医生 这样之前就不用受这么多苦了 我是一个很挑剔的人 但在许医生这里享受到的一切 我都无法挑剔（除了等待时间有点久 但可以理解 也是值得的！）如果你还在迷茫挑选牙医！许医生这里绝对是第一选择！之后我也会继续在许医生这里接受治疗 感谢这家诊所的每一个工作人员❤️</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) At Dentist Xu, my wisdom tooth was extracted because my wisdom tooth was troublesome and belonged to an ambush. The doctor in charge was a senior expert. The anesthetic was administered very well. There were two injections in total, and I did not feel any pain. The speed of surgery and tooth extraction is very fast, about 10 minutes, even faster than waiting for the anesthetic. It is a very good medical experience. The doctors and nurses here are very gentle and responsible, and I highly recommend Xu Dental Clinic!

在许牙医拔了下牙智齿，因为我的智齿比较麻烦属于埋伏的，主管的医生是一位资深专家，麻药打得很好，一共两针，都没有感受到疼痛，在麻药劲儿上来以后，开刀和拔牙的速度很快大约10来分钟，甚至比等麻药上劲儿还快，是一次很不错的就医体验。这里的医生和护士小姐姐都非常温柔负责，非常推荐许牙医诊所！</Review>

The dentist is also very professional and will explain to you in detail the plan that suits you. Every month, I will explain the progress to you. It doesn't matter if you don't speak English, there are staff who can speak Chinese. Very recommended! I also chose to come here because of a friend's recommendation. The price is reasonable, the service is good, and the effect is very good.

<username>Ailan Chen</username><user>107129544180345304525</user><review>(Translated by Google) Today I finally completed the last course of dental fillings. I really appreciate all the colleagues of this dentist for serving us so hard during the epidemic. Give them ten likes! I only saw dentistry for the first time when I was in my 30s. If I hadn't had to do it, I would run away if I could. Because I'm so scared, I get goose bumps whenever I hear the squeaking of those tools, and my palms are sweaty! But since choosing Xu Dental, this feeling of fear has been slowly wiped out! Especially that young Doctor Xu, his kind smile will calm your nervousness slowly. Moreover, he will first have a relaxed chat with you and explain your dental problems in detail, but it will make you feel confident that he can help you solve these problems. He will always soothe your emotions so that you trust him, and then let you start to receive dental treatment easily. I am very happy that I have solved one of my troubles in this difficult year and can welcome 2021 happily and worry-free! On this platform, I would like to thank Xu Dental’s patient reception ladies and assistants who carefully assisted the doctors, as well as Dr. Xu who made me feel relieved to treat him. I sincerely thank them! I hope everyone is safe and healthy in the new year, and everything goes well!

今天終於完成最後一個療程的補牙，真的很感謝這家牙醫的所有同事們在疫情期間還這麼用心的為我們服務，給他們十個贊！我30幾歲了才第一次看牙科，如果不是迫不得已，能逃避的我都會逃避。因為我好害怕，每當我聽到那些工具的吱吱聲就馬上起雞皮疙瘩，緊張得手心冒汗！但自從選擇了許牙科之後，這恐懼的感覺慢慢的被磨滅！尤其那位年輕的許醫生，他那親切的笑容會讓你緊張的情緒慢慢平復下來。而且，他會先跟你輕鬆的聊聊天，詳細的解釋一下你牙齒的問題，但是又會讓你覺得他很有信心能幫助你解決這些問題。他總是很會這樣安撫你的情緒讓你信任他，然後才讓你開始輕鬆的接受牙齒治療。很開心在這艱難的一年又解決了我一件煩心事，可以開心無憂的迎接2021！借此平台，感謝許牙科那些耐心的前台小姐們和細心協助醫生的助理們，還有特別讓我放心給他治療的許醫生，真心感謝他們！希望大家新的一年都平安健康，一切順利！<//review>< Resp>

Dr. Irvin is really the best dentist I have ever seen. He is very gentle and gentle. Patience will also explain carefully. During the COVID period, they have strengthened disinfection and cleaning.

When filling your teeth, Dr. Xu always cares about whether you are comfortable and encourages you from time to time. Wow, it’s great. The young lady at the front desk is also super patient and careful to help you explain the teeth, and pay attention to the teeth. Matters, it’s super awesome, dentistry can do it, everyone can get their teeth.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I called to make an appointment and was able to see it in the same week. When I got there, every dentist and nurse in the clinic was friendly and they took several covid-19 preventive measures, including gargle with mouthwash. Dr. Irvin is patient every time.

(Translated by Google) If you use insurance to do ordinary cleaning, the doctor will walk around and go to see it for 55 minutes, then pay more than 200 deep teeth cleaning, even if the child is full of deciduous teeth, there is no sense of responsibility of a doctor.
When I saw a woman coming in at a fee, and didn't lie down, the doctor immediately rushed to see it. We waited for 55 minutes before someone would pay attention. Choose carefully!

(Original)
如果用保险去做普通洗牙，医生会走来走去，55分钟后才过来看了两分钟，之后要付款200多深度洗牙，哪怕是满口乳牙的孩子，完全没有一个医生的责任感。
当见到一位女士自付费进来的，还没躺下，医生就马上冲上去看了，我们可是等了55分钟才有人理会的。慎重选择！</text>

(Translated by Google) Don't go to this clinic. I have bleeding gums over there. A heavy tooth cleaning has no effect at all. The doctor said it was nothing at all and it was expensive. I went to other clinics to treat the bleeding gums for a good price. It's also cheap. A bad clinic knows the money!

别去这个诊所.我是牙龈出血在那边.做个了重度洗牙一点效果都没有.医生还说没事一点都不负责而且价钱又贵.去了别的诊所才把牙龈出血给治疗好价钱也便宜.烂诊所就知道钱！<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I have been here to see Dr Irvin Kaw for more than ten years. In addition to general examinations and cleaning, he also performed braces, root canal treatments, and implants for me. Dr Kaw is very friendly and caring about his patients. My teeth are not very good, there are a lot of problems, Dr Kaw is very patient with me to explain my situation, how to choose implants or bridges, and the risks of different choices. When I first came here to see my teeth, my teeth were not very healthy. At that time, Dr Kaw spent more than ten minutes each time teaching me how to keep my mouth clean to reduce future risks. It took a few years to process the problematic teeth, and Dr Kaw was very careful during this time. I can only check and clean my teeth regularly, which is much better than ten years ago. Every staff member in this clinic is professional and friendly. I sincerely recommend Dr Kaw and East West Dental to every friend who wants to find a careful and professional dentist.

I have been here here to see Dr Irvin Kaw for over 10 years. He has done crowns, implants, and root canal therapies for me as well as basic dental cleaning and maintenance. Dr. Kaw is very caring and kind. I have had a Lot of dental issues and Dr. Kaw carefully explained to me what my situation was, what my risks were and how I should weigh the pros and cons when choosing whether to do a bridge or to get a dental implant. When I first started seeing him My teeth were in such a bad condition that in every visit to the dental office he would spend 15 minutes educating me on how to keep my teeth as clean as possible to minimize the risks I would be facing in the future. Out all the issues I've had for a long time and now I basically only require routine cleaning. My condition is way better than what it was 10 years ago. Everyone who works in this clinic is super nice too. I recommend Dr. Irvin And East West Dental to everyone who is looking for a professio Nal and caring dentist.

我來這裡看Dr Irvin Kaw已經有十年以上了。除了一般的檢查和洗牙，他也替我做過牙套、根管治療、還有植牙。Dr Kaw非常友善，也很關心他的病人。我的牙齒不太好，有很多問題，Dr Kaw很有耐性的跟我解釋我的情況，如何選擇要做植牙還是做牙橋，和不同選擇所要面對的風險。我剛開始來這裡看牙齒的時候，我的牙齒健康不太好，那時候Dr Kaw每次都花十多分鐘教我如何保持口腔清潔，以降低將來的風險。接下來用了幾年的時間把有問題的牙齒都處理好了，這段時間Dr Kaw都非常細心。我現在只要定期檢查和洗牙就可以，跟十年前相比實在好太多了。這個診所的每位工作人員都很專業和友善。我誠意推薦Dr Kaw跟East West Dental給每位想要找一個既細心又專業的牙醫的朋友。

< Review>
Got my head shaved for only $8.00.

My barber was friendly and efficient.

Gave her a big tip, for staying open late on a Sunday afternoon.  :)<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I would get a haircut with them when I was in HS in 2007. They then relocated a few times and I lost track of their location until I finally came across this new shop last year in 2019. Best place, they really know how to cut hair,  the ladies are very nice, and the prices are reasonably affordable!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Super fast and super cheap. The cut itself wasnt too bad either.
Other people say they "forget" to do your sideburns but my barber specifically asked if I wanted them done.
Probably the best 8 dollars I've spent.< /Review></record>

This is a good inexpensive place to cut your hair! It is run by mexican women. There is always a long wait here, but you can write your name and then come after some time.
This place only accepts cash, but if you don't have cash, don't worry as there is an ATM here.
Compared to the prices in other barber shops around here, this is really inexpensive.
There is a TV and magazines here so you don't have to be bored! Also you can chat with the barbers too!< /text>

<Review>The only reason they have a huge line all the time is because they take unnecessarily long on each haircut. They took a break in the middle of my haircut, which was a simple fade and should've taken 15 minutes but took 40 minutes. I waited there for over an hour and they hadn't gotten through one person. In total I was there for 2 hrs for a simple haircut. I'm glad they take care and effort but this was excessive.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2c7f1608e902f:0xaba3a3b12891b2cc</GmapID>< response>

Totally worth the $8 but calling ahead is a smart idea as I have seen the line get pretty long in the place. Overall great service and worth the money.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

8$ for a haircut. Neat, clean place and very cordial people running the shop. They were very open to any suggestions/questions.
Best bet for anyone looking for a good and affordable haircut near USC.< /review>

Each lady does a different job when I go get my haircuts. Never a bad haircut though but good enough for the cost of 8-10 bucks. You get what you pay for. Friendly employees and wait time can be slow or fast at some times<//Text>

I've heard about this place, so I decided to go in. Their prices are good, haircut not so good. You pay for what you get I guess should be their motto. The ladies are friendly, they didn't remember to cut my sideburns evenly. The older plumper lady with the orange/red hair was the one that I allowed to "give me a haircut". If she wasn't so nice I would have walked away with out paying. To be fair once she saw the face of discontent I had she did attempt to "fix" my hair, but you can only do so much when it is already way shorter than what you wanted it to be.<//review>

The hair stylists believe that 2 fingers means that you want your hair length to be 2 fingers rather than trimming two fingers. During the hair cut they face you away from the mirror so you can't even see them cutting your hair. And to make matters even worse while they're cutting your hair they will take phone calls and continue cutting during the call. Ridiculous. I wish I had my hair and money back</Text>

They were really "chill" and nice. But it was a horrible haircut. Next time, I will ask if they are good before I proceed with business.</Review>

<Review>The lady gave me very bad hair cut and finished her job in 10 mins without proper haircut. They want to finish haircut for as many as they can in min time . Not a good place to go there. Only one plus point is that they charge 8$-15$ for haircut.< /Review>< Pictures>

Smooch’s Cure<//Name>
<time>1612303266379<//time><Rating>1<//Rating>< Review>
How can I get a refund for the $99.99 purchase to use the app? I downloaded it thinking I needed a 1099 then didn’t log on for months and then was told by my tax guy that that’s not what I need so therefore I don’t need or didn’t need their service. Looking for a full refund as I’m doing it the old fashion way with a tax person! I keep emailing them with no response on how to get a refund. Need HELP!</Review>

Very easy, accurate, and I love being able to ask a simple questions via text. I already feel like a 1099 tax expert! Love it!<//text>

We are all human and mistakes are made but taking responsibility for it is what they did which is very honest and the correct thing to do. Thank you very much!<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Keeper Tax has really helped me manage my expenses on the go. Having someone to text me asking about each transaction has saved me significant time at the end of the year when I usually wait to do it all at once. When filing taxes came around, I wasn't dreading it as much. Before, there were definitely things I would miss, but since Tax Keepers tells you how much you're getting back in the bank, it incentivizes you to stay organized. I highly recommend this product (which is also a write-off) if you value your time.<//review>< pics>

Keeper Tax has been such a huge time saver for keeping track of my finances. I am an independent contractor and this helps me from keeping track of my expenses weekly. They constantly text you to keep up to date with delegating your expenses. I would highly recommend Keeper Tax! They even did my taxes efficiently and for an cost effective rate. I even face timed with the CEO. Their customer service is top notch.</Review>

The best way to do your self employed book keeping and the fees are NOT outrageous like they are for other places. I absolutely love how easy it is to track my business expenses and doing my taxes this year was super easy. It's never been this easy before.</Text>

Amazing, easy app that tracks my expenses as a freelancer for me. Link it to your credit card(s) and let the AI do the rest. They've caught a ton of business expenses that I missed or simply forgot to record. I've already recommended this to freelancers in my network from various industries. Highly recommended!</text>

I have always dabbled in freelancing but it wasn't until a few years ago I really only did just that...contract to contract. Each year during tax time I found myself sifting through receipts and countless transaction lists and STILL owing almost as much as the deductions I thought I would get.

So, after paying and paying I finally Googled "best freelancer bookkeeping tools" and Keeper Tax popped up. It was then that I tried it out for 30 days and quickly saw the benefits- from the texts confirming potential write offs, automatically sorting my expenses while eliminating the dreaded never-ending lists, boxes of receipts and keeping a separate spreadsheet...then learning they could do my taxes for free or a nominal fee was even better...then the rolled out the feature of calculating quarterly taxes and all of this for only <$10/month. Hell yeah! I'd be a fool not to.

The best thing about Keeper Tax is that when you receive the texts about potential write-offs and you respond...it's a REAL person...not a bot. I've sent happy faces and received them back. LOL. Super simple but knowing that a REAL person is communicating with you is the best.<//text>

This has made things so much more streamlined and hands off for me. My only minor issue is that sometimes things get automatically miscategorized due to their name (Sunday Motor Cafe and Ride+Reflect as car expenses when they're a cafe and my workout studio, respectively). It's nice that some things *are* automatically categorized as write-offs, but I'm having trouble with things being autocategorized as *not* write-offs. Other than that, streamlined, easy, responsive and accurate!</Review>

< Review>
Tax Keeper is great and very helpful. Anyone who does the "side-hustle" gig or if the "side-hustle" is your "hustle" then you need to get this. Unless you know what and what cannot be a full or partial write off, but if you're new to this game like I am, then I would suggest Keeper Tax. I get updates on all transactions that I do that qualify to be a write off and I get a weekly summary of them sent to my email. Link your bank(s) and that's it.  No need to worry, they got your back. :)<//Review>

I love it. I have it linked to my bank account so Caitlin, my bookkeeper does the write offs from monthly expenses such as my mobile bill or travel. Whenever there are unclear expenses she asks if it was a business related expense or not. You also have the option to file taxes right on the app! I recommend the app.< /review>

<Review>I love the system because it gives me the ability to code/categorize transactions right on the spot rather than having to fix everything at the end of the year and being overwhelmed and then procrastinate getting everything filed. It’s a quick text each day where I respond with “one, two, three, or all” and then it’s done. At the end of the year, I can export everything and again it’s done<//Review><userid>108117049887535110621</userid><Rate>5</Rate><user_name>Shelley Mitchell</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<review>No live person to contact. Paid for my expense exports, they never arrived, was told to check my spam folder by the system robot, then no other responses. Brilliant. Have been told for months my taxes would take 5 days to file, it’s literally been months. If you’re deductions outweigh your income, which is possible, your taxes will never file and you will constantly Be redirected to reviewing your taxes and submitting again, with no one to talk to. Seems like a convenient service, but ends up being a wildly unprofessional experience.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>This service helps you categorize your business expenses as they happen to make filing your taxes less of a chore. As a bonus, I have caught several unwanted subscriptions and unauthorized charges in time to stop them. Dealing with your business expenses as they happen is much better than waiting, trying to remember, and searching for receipts.</Text>< Pictures>

I have never heard of Keeper Tax until I was wrongfully charged $6 to my account. When I
Doing my research I found out it’s a tax service for freelancers. I am NOT a free lancer I CAN’T even file taxes. When I tried to reach out to get this fixed the was no number to contact anyone and all of my emails have been ignored. If I could give negative stars I would!< /Review>

I love how they inform you how much each purchase related to your business is a tax write off. I mean you can have a CPA do it, or, through Keeper Tax,  you can know on the spot!</Text>

They have found more write offs then I ever thought were possible. My husband  who is very nervous about ANYONE other then us having access to our bank account has been so impressed with the level of service and professionalism of Caitlin our Keepertax rep. She has helped us find so much $ that we didnt know was even possible to write off! Worth every single $ thats spent!< /review>

Professional and Friendly. Few for Keeper Tax app with the app it need alternative way or Option for account recover if your mobile is ever lost, change, or forgotten phone number you can login. At least an email that you signed up with. Also option to change your bank card or to add multiple, without needing a live associated.</Review>

<review>We were here today for brunch. Even though we used Yelp to get in line ahead of time, and had a baby with us, we still waited 45 minutes in line! After we finally set down the waitress that came to us wasn't sure if someone already took our order or not... The whole place felt disorganized. The food itself was good enough, large portions, the bacon wasn't overcooked and the pancake was good. However, we will not be returning after the long wait.< /review>< Pics>

<Date>1560735354551< /Date><Rating>3< /Rating><review>I have a few things to share about the place and the service, less about the food. The most important one - THE TIP IS INCLUDED IN THE BILL!

The good
* The freshly squeezed juices are soooo good! Very refreshing, although not cheap (~$6-7 for a medium sized glass)
* The food is fresh and good - Chocolate chip pancakes were delicious!

The bad
* PSA! The tip is already included when you get the check! - They never mentioned that, and I found out about it a few hours too late. I know it's my fault as you should scan the bill and verify, but that usually happens when there is a big party - We were four people, and no one mentioned anything about it. Really annoying and makes you feel cheated.
* The place is tiny but we were ready for that and joined the queue from home via Yelp. When we came, we were the third party in line (total of four people). With all that, we've waited over 50 minutes to be seated. Not sure if we got unlucky, but this something you need to take into consideration
* Brunch - The potatoes were good, a bit too salty, the eggs were great, but no salt or pepper at all.  Kind of weird.

Due to the issue with the tip, while the place is nice, I feel like it is not entirely honest and I won't be coming back.< /review>< Pictures>

Big portions with big prices. You can probably share plates instead. I would rather have lower portions with lower prices so I could order other items.

Food was okay. Wasn't blown away.

Decor was a little dark and seemed like the intention was to be trendy. Didn't quite do it for me though.< /text>

<text>Four of us enjoyed brunch at the counter.  My chicken soup was so pretty that others took a picture of it.  Delicious too. Plenty of large chunks of chicken and vegetables.  The menu had a mix of healthy and indulgent food.  We were all happy with our meals.<//text>< Pictures>

When our regular breakfast place was to crowded we thought we'd give this place a try and we were not disappointed.  Food was great quality, served quickly and good portion size.  I especially liked the bacon which came with my eggs.  It was not too crispy, a tad on the pleasantly thick side and very meaty.  Give this place a try.<//Text>

<Text>This place is a well oiled machine. They're constantly moving and prepping and also manage to be very attentive and friendly. My water glad is never empty for long. The food is also really good, comes out fast and I think the entrees are well priced, too. Great neighborhood spot!</Text>< pictures>

Great food, decent selection, and the prices aren't outrageous if not a bit high. Service is awesome as well. They have pretty limited hours in my opinion, so check before you come or you might be disappointed.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Ate the crazy Moco (pork katsu, rice, gravy, 2 eggs sunny side up), which is a very filling and delicious way to start your day. The atmosphere is a bit loud due to the small space, but the service is fairly fast and the large glass walls make the space feel larger. There are both tables and counter seats which filled up around noon today. When we arrived at 1130,  we did not wait for a table (4 top).

If you're looking for a good, solid breakfast beyond your standard eggs, bacon, and toast, I recommend coming here. If it's busy, be prepared to wait.< /Review>< pics>

They obviously don't want to make money out keep customers happy. Restaurants shouldn't close before posted hours. I have also filled a complaint with the health department and better business bureau. Stay away from this place...don't waste your money!< /text>< pics>

Great breakfast and coffee shop that’s a welcome change up from the normal Starbucks. Cozy interior and friendly staff, would’ve given 5 stars if wasn’t for the small portions and pricey menu/coffee.<//Text>

Delicious food, in a new setting gives this place a welcoming feel. We did the 6th inferno bacon, homemade turkey sausage, and lemon ricotta pancakes; all of which were unique. We'll be back to try more for sure.</text>

Overpriced and very mediocre. Coffee was fine; food was nothing memorable. I ate here recently and cannot remember what I ate, and remember having to get more food afterwards because I was left hungry and paid too much money to leave hungry.</text>

<review>Wait: As there are very few brunch spots around the Inner Richmond, this place tends to have a 20-30 min wait. They do have the Yelp reservation system though, so you can reserve your spot in line ahead of time without having to actually wait outside.

Ambiance: The place is pretty small, but has a cozy feel. Even though it's usually busy, service is pretty fast and staff is friendly and attentive.

Food: I had the Crazy Moco with a side of bacon. The pork katsu was slightly dry, but the crust was super crispy. The gravy was very rich and had a nice little kick (though I could use a little more). The bacon was nice and thick, but still crispy. My companion had the crab Benedict. The eggs were poached well and the hollandaise was nice and creamy. The crab wasn't too sweet, but was still good.

Price: The portions are quite big here, but the price seemed a bit too high for what you are getting. The Benedict dish ended up being around $30.</review>< GmapID>

Coffee leaves a little bit to be desired, and sometimes the potatoes are a little hard, but we keep coming back time and time again for the crazy good french toast and omlettes.</Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>It's all about the inferno bacon, lemon ricotta pancakes, and loco moco dishes. The rest of the menu is pretty "meh". Don't forget you can order a single side pancake for $6 or some bacon on the side as well. The super moco was pretty big -- enough for two to share with a couple of additional sides. We also ordered the B mix-up, which was okay, but I'd probably pass on it for next time as I couldn't really appreciate the crumbled bread and potato side. The BACON was the best part.

The ginger espresso shot was interesting -- mostly ginger and lemon, but no coffee flavor at all. Tasted like a great health / immunity booster.

The restaurant definitely looks like it took over an old Chinese restaurant with the neon lighting.< /Review><name>Audrey L<//name><resp>None</resp>< date>

A great neighborhood brunch spot. The menu items are delicious, the orange juice is worth it, and you'll leave satiated. On the down side, there are around 6 tables here, but staff runs around like they are trying to cover 20 tables. Chill guys, it's sunday🤙<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Brought out golden puppy here for his first day care experience. Couldn’t have been happier with the experience from the first phone call (they called our vet for us to get vaccine records) to the complementary bath he got at the end of the day (he got messy and they cleaned him up!). Sent us home with some sweet Valentine’s Day treats for humans and puppy. So excited to have found a place to drop our puppy off for the day. He loved it and arrived home happy and tired. I won’t even look anywhere else - can’t be better than this.</review>< pictures>

<review>I did not know what I was going to do with our 11 week old puppy when we had to go out of town and this place came to the rescue. Everyone was so nice and informative. I loved that we could watch our pup on the camera.  We picked her up and she was clean and as happy as could be. Definitely recommend.<//review></record>

My dog has been going here for 6 years. He loves it! He gets so excited whenever he goes because he knows he gets to play with his friends all day. I love it because the staff is great and always so accommodating. I have recommended it to other friends and they agree. Great place!</review>

Our 7 month old Sheepadoodle Charlie is a bundle of energy.  We bring him to paws at least once a week to socialize with other dogs and have fun outside our home.  He loves it!  Great staff and great experience for our pup!<//Text>

It was my first time leaving my dog Oryx. I was a little anxious about boarding, but it was extremely comforting to watch him have so much fun on the doggie cam, and recieve so much love from the workers!🥰 I decided to give the grooming a try as well, and he is so clean, smells so good, and is extremely soft and detailed! Every worker I encountered was so wonderful, sweet, and welcoming. I felt good about leaving our Oryx with them. The prices are so reasonable, and we will be buying him a pass to come back and play every week. He seemed so happy, and at peace when we picked him up. We are so glad we found him a second home where he can get social time, and where we can trust others to watch our boy.♥️🌈</Text>

Our puppy loves going to Paws and we love taking her there!
Great staff, fun and supervised playtime, and the training has worked wonders!

The best part? Our 6 month old, high energy puppy comes home EXHAUSTED and HAPPY at the end of a long day.

We highly recommend Paws!</text>

The staff is SO friendly and know how to handle the toughest dogs. My border collie gets super excited when I tell her we’re going to Paws! If she stays overnight she comes home so stinky so definitely request a bath before you pick up.<//review>

<text>We have taken our dog to a few other places previously, but this has been our favorite. Currently take 2 dogs here on a regular basis Staff is always friendly, and knows our pups by name. Our dogs get excited as soon as we pull in the parking lot, and they are just as ready to nap after we pick them up. Only complaint I could have is that I wish their camera setup was better.</text>< time>

<text>Paws is like a second home for our puppy. He loves to go everyday and gets excited when we turn on to the street.

My puppy loves the staff there and is always trying to get hugs and attention from them.

I would recommend anyone with dogs to try here and I’m sure you and your dog will love it.<//text><username>Dave Penrice< /username><gmapID>0x80dce9c2e3e8a0bd:0x953906cca81a40b2< /gmapID>< time>

<Review>I know I can confidently leave my 2 pups there and they will be well taken care of. They love going there. Our 5 y.o. german shepard sings when we get to paws resort. Before taking her to Paws, she would bark at everyone and now she is approachable. Staff is very knowledgeable on how to train dogs and know our pets well. They are also available to board them on a moment's notice. Great staff! Thank you for doing a great job with Gypsy.

Paws Pet Resort is an absolutely wonderful place!  Our dog Jinx has been going to Paws since he was 6 months old.  All I have to say is "Wanna go play??" And he knows he's heading to Paws.  He's normally a really shy dog, but when we pull into their parking lot Jinx is a different dog!  He greets every stranger he meets in the lobby, and, with tail wagging, trots along to whoever is going to walk him back to the play room.  The staff here is absolutely wonderful.  They remember us every time we come in.  They're always available to answer questions. Take your dogs here!  You'll be happy you did, and so will your furry friends!< /review>

We really trust the crew with our boys, not true of the 2 other places we tried! They are organized and the boys haven't had to visit the vet after their stay. Always a good thing. Thanks Paws.<//text>

<Text>My Chihuahua (Fritz) loves Paws Pet Resort! He has a blast - and comes home exhausted from playing all day.

The staff is amazing. They are true dog lovers and shower my dog with affection. I've learned a lot about taking care of Fritz from the staff at Paws Pet Resort.

Fritz can't wait to return to see his friends (both human and canine) at Paws every day.

If your dog is lonely and bored, bring him/her in for a fun-filled day at PPR; your dog will love you (even more) for it. :0D<//Text>< pics>

We've been taking our two dogs to the Lake Forest location for years. They've also been at the San Clemente location  a couple of times. Our dogs don't do the playgroup because they don't always play nice with strange dogs. However, what I love about Paws is that there's a separate room where a staff member will take dogs to play that don't do the larger group. They also go on numerous walks and runs. A staff member once told me one of my dogs was their best skateboarder dog! I never feel they don't get enough attention or exercise, despite not doing playgroup. And they've never come home sick (dogs are required to get the bordetalla vaccine every six months to be allowed to stay there.) We tried a number of other facilities before Paws, and none of them could come close to the care and attention Paws gives to our dogs. I also love the work they do with rescue dogs.< /text>

I made an oder on January 21, 2020. The following Monday January 25 I looked up the order status with the tracking number from FEDEX and it said package was delivered. I gave FEDEX another day in good faith that my package would show up and the delay was chalked up pandemic issues' and the work force. The next day January 26, still no package. I contact The Honest Company and spoke with Nick who told me, he would contact FEDEX and start a package investigation. He confirmed my email and said I would get an email in 2 business days. I did not get an email so, I contacted The Honest Company customer service for the second time on January 28. In this phone call I was told that the investigation process takes 3-5 days. They assured me after the investigation I would receive an email resolving my issue. It is now February 5,  and no call or email from The Honest Company. I had to call them again for the third time. After the representative looked into the matter and asked if I had received the package,  asked me if I would like a credit  or refund. I  asked for a refund and she said I would get an email in 1-3 business days and then it is  up to the Credit card company how long before I am refunded. This was very poor  customer service. I should not have to call back three time to resolve my issue. Nick should have offered to resend out the order. I did not receive any email from The Honest Company regarding the FEDEX investigation as I was told I would.  Very poor customer service! If I could give your company a negative star rating it would be -5.< /review>

If you're making a purchase, make sure to create an account and not use the guest check out option.  I ordered 5 bottles of hand sanitizer with a pump and they went straight to the trash. The product was so bad I was unable to use. The sanitizer left a sticky residue almost glue like on hands which required a hand wash afterwards.  I called customer service but they explained that because I did a guest check out I was unable to exchange or return the product.< /Text>

<text>I ordered 48 of the free and clear hand sanitizers as gifts for my quarantine wedding. Nobody wanted to tell me how bad they smelled, most people threw them away! When I finally smelled one I was embarrassed that I have them out. I reached out to Honest and they responded with the generic because of Covid and it’s a new formula and the smell dissipates. It’s not an alcohol smell nor does it dissipate quickly. It’s just a really bad smell, bad enough for people to throw it away. Too bad because I thought Honest was better than this.<//text>< name>

<Review>DIShonest company! Terrible customer service! Long story short, I received a gift card as a baby shower present and placed my first order using only half of the balance of my gift card yet it forced me to input my credit card information in order to process the order. I specifically remember not selecting to subscribe since I hate subscriptions. Yet l wake up one day to an email from them that my order is processing. I emailed and called them and was told they can’t do anything about it. I mean, they didn’t even get my shipping address correct and it’s missing my unit number and they charged my credit card! I have a gift card still I could have used if I wanted to buy the product (which I don’t need nor want). Oh and to add to the injury, they charged shipping! Ugh, I don’t know how this company stays in business. Their products are mediocre. Their diapers are rough and their detergent doesn’t do the job and please never order hand sanitizer, it stinks soooo bad. I would never recommend this company, horrible!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

With the exception of the diapers which I think are the best option I found when my kids were in them a few years ago, their other products are just mediocre. Not horrible, but I've found much better options in the "natural" category. we also had issues with the sunscreen spray which my husband got very burned after applying tons of it.... I'm sure they are trying their best but perhaps they are just too big to have specialty products that stand out like other boutique "mom and pops" brands.......I just don't see anything especially unique or great (with the exception of the diapers which I loved)< /Text>

I have sensitive skin that gets oily easily. I’m always hesitant to order online. Due to covid I’ve received several emails about how they are behind, which I wasn’t in a huge hurry anyways. But I still received my package in a timely matter. The products ordered and used (prime + perfect mask, hydra gel and magic gel to milk) I already had the vitamin c serum and everyday radiance. My skin hasn’t felt this smooth and glowy in a long time. Love love love these products.</text>

I heard great things about these diapers so I purchased 2 boxes from target in fairview heights il. And my daughter had a bad reaction to then, so I contacted honest through email and the lady told me nothing she can do, cant refund my money! Which on the box it states if your not 100 percent satisfied you can get your money back! Thats not true shows how honest the company truely is! I'll never purchase anymore products from them and will not recommend to anyone!!<//Review>

<text>Let this sink in. It took 14 days to tell me that part of my order was out of stock, and 16 days and counting to receive the balance of my order.
You would think , if the company sees I’m ordering a prearranged gift, that chances are it’s for a function (ie. Baby Shower). And if it’s not in stock you’d think they’d call or email me within a few days to notify me that hey- buddy, you may want to look elsewhere for that gift so you don’t go empty- handed. But no. Zero notifications. I had to email the company a week into no order arrival. Then it took them another 3 days to scramble for an answer.
It’s just a poorly run company. Too many red flags for me on the customer communication end.
There are so many other all natural, organic baby lines out there. Don’t feed the beast. Support someone else who actually values your business< /text>< pics>

I started using the Honest company with my first daughter four years ago and loved the products (even though I had a number of issues with their billing and costumer service). Started using Honest diapers again with my second child about a year ago and have been steadily losing faith within the company over time. The diapers don't seem to hold up the way they did with my first child. My order just before the last did not include wipes (because they supposedly ran out. How does a diaper company run out of wipes?!), and the $15 credit that they gave us to compensate did not even cover the cost of us buying another four packs of wipes at the store (which was another huge hassle). They had also sent me size 4 diapers when my daughter was still in 3's (ended up keeping them because my daughter was close to being in 4's and I honestly did not want the hassle of sending them the diapers back and waiting another week for my new ones.
I just received my most recent order today which included wipes, but they were nothing like the quality of wipes they use to be. For one, its new packaging (which I absolutely hate because it is more difficult to get the wipes out of the packaging) and looks like its almost half the amount of wipes that use to be included into the bundles. The wipes were also extremely thin and overly wet (one reason why I liked the Honest wipes over all the other brands was because they did not leave so much extra residue behind on my baby's butt. That is no longer the case for they now leave just as much, if not more than the leading brands).
This is the last order I will ever make with the Honest company. I use to recommended them to everyone I know, now I will worn every person I know of what a cheap and untrustworthy company it has become. There are plenty of other natural diaper companies out there today who I'm sure would be happy to have my business.< /Text>

<review>We tried out two different bundles and loved the products we received. We're planning on ordering the diaper and wipes bundle once our baby is born. We received a shipment earlier than we would have liked and the billing department took care if it in under 5 min-no hassle, no problems, very simple. We received our refund three days later and scheduled our shipment for two months down the line. I'm usually skeptical but this company has really come through in quality and customer service. We're sticking with the Honest Company!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb3f2d4d9511:0xe4f10bde86900777</Gmap_id></record>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>I ordered products online and they arrived broken/leaking. These items were not simply mishandled by USPS. These items were packaged improperly from the beginning with half of the items not having the proper seals, appearing used. The hand sanitizer was half empty. The wet floor pads were dried out completely.

That said, I was able to get replacement items shipped within the next business week at no extra cost. The products are great quality and I support the company's mission wholeheartedly.

Customer service addressed my complaints relatively quickly.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Great diapers.. such cute designs but the customer service is terrible seriously being on the phone on hold for an hour and a half is ridiculous! Just to cancel an order that’s in processing. Then I tried the online “live” chat.. nothing! I was 60th in queue waited until I was 3rd..then I was bumped to 56.. waited got down to 16.. them bumped to 50th!!! What in the world!?! Now I’m trying email and I hope I reach someone!! I don’t want to deal with the headache of returning the bundle! Ugh!! Being a mom of 2 under 3, I don’t have time to sit on the computer or phone all day!< /review>

Terrible customer service. I contacted the company since I have allergies and needed to know what certain ingredients were derived from but they didnt know and said they would get back to me. After months of waiting, I decided to follow up with them and the representative told me it takes a long time to find out. Lol Its been a year and still no answers. For a company who takes pride in their ingredients, not knowing what they are is a total embarrassment.</review>

It's a thai massage so there's options like stepping on your back or just body stretches they do with you.

This was my first time, Chris and Gina were amazing. If you want a real Massge come to this place, do Thai Sweedish combo. You’ll leave this place, feeling like a feather.</review>

Very nice people. They did a great job working out knots in my shoulders and my sciatic nerve feels much better too. There was some soreness the next day but only in the areas where I had knots.< /text>

By the way, the website on this search "serenity" is not to the Thai massage place.< /Text><user_id>108839902217840345137</user_id>< gmap_id>

First time getting a full body, me and my wife, was great, fell very relaxed. The only thing is that people were keep calling to make appointments and it can get loud in a small room when u r trying to relax. But other than that it was great.<//Review>

<Time>1621786844601</Time><Text>This little downtown store has a great selection of quality outdoor sports equipment and clothing. I know people need to go and touch stuff before you buy it and see what it's like, and balance that against the cost savings of online shopping. But if you can afford to shop at brick and mortar stores this is a great one to support. Would hate to lose it.</Text>< Rate>

They have a great selection, especially considering Chico's size. The staff is absolutely fantastic, they really want you to get what you need and are not into just selling you the most expensive item. They are my first stop for all of my backpacking needs.< /text>

I'm just getting into hiking and needed to buy my first pair of hiking boots. While the selection wasn't great (I was hoping for more choices overall and more stylish women's selections), the service was amazing. Nora pulled out several pairs that she thought would suit my needs until I found a good pair, answered every single question I had, and gave me her full attention. While I didn't get the "look" of the shoe I had envisioned, I left feeling confident that I had selected the right shoe for the function I was looking for, and I wouldn't have gotten that shopping online. I'll definitely be back for future outdoor outfitting needs!</Text>

They have everything you need for hiking and camping, they carry righteous brands like Patagonia and the employees are knowledgeable and nice.

Awesome local outdoor sports store! Employees are friendly and very willing to help. They have a pretty great selection of local brands (western mountaineering/bedrock). Definitely worth checking out!<//Text>

< Review>
I’ve tried to support this store multiple times, and I’ve bought a few items in the past, but today was my last attempt at shopping here. The customer service needs major improvement. No one greets you when you walk in, even when they are not busy. The young woman I approached, to ask her a question about sizing, was unfriendly with a slight tone of agitation and a condescending attitude. It’s truly unfortunate because I try my best to support local business, and without a big store like REI in Chico, our options here are limited. However, I’d rather do my shopping online, or drive to Sacramento,  than deal with poor customer service. Not worth it to me.< /Review>

It was a nice and organised store with good quality brands, but I was unhappy with the customer service. There were people doing nothing at the font desk who didn't notice or try to help me out. It didn't make me want to buy anything in there:(</text>

Absolutely the best place to buy outdoor gear in Chico. They don't have the largest selection but anything you get here will be top quality and the prices will be good. Every time I've been in here the staff is friendly and helpful even when I'm just killing time looking at stuff.</Text>

If you like the outdoors, you want to be safe, protected and warm. You'll find all that at Mountain Sports along with an excellent staff you can trust. I won't trust my safety to anyone else.</Review>

If you like history from the early 1900s, this should be on your list. It’s a nice and friendly place to visit for a $1 admission fee. It is small and full of actual, old products you would have found at your local general store. If history isn’t your thing, you’ll probably want to skip it. But if seeing things up close and personal like you see in the pictures posted for this place sounds neat, make sure you check it out!<//Text>

<review>Fantastic little museum. It is small, but absolutely packed with very interesting items from long ago. Please do donate something when you enter, they certainly deserve it and need such to continue to provide the public with such a great service and lesson(s) in history. Children are absolutely welcome. Everyone will love this step back in time.< /review><date>1558897166726</date><username>C K M<//username><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

Worth the dollar fee. A collection of late 1800's to 1940's items displayed store like. Well done and interesting. Nothing special and similar collection are found across the country. Finding parking downtown Palm Springs is a pain on Saturday.< /Review>

It certainly helps to be over 60 to appreciate it, although several of the younger generation were enjoying it as we walked through the store.</review>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>A glimpse into the commercial past. This was a passion of an avid collector. This pre WW2 exhibit of general merchandise available in a common US general store is extensive: from bulk food containers to articles of clothing and a complete Great Depression era pharmacy -- everything is authentic right down to the 80+ year old pickles in an oak barrel (we were kindly offered to try one but we politely refused). For less than a dollar for admission you can see some recognizable favorites and bygone novelties of a less techy yesteryear.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80db1ba5d791f05f:0xe3bced58edcee51c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1605143432409<//Date><text>I really appreciate the vegan food they have here and it's all super tasty! My only suggestion is to have the coffee machine next to the cashier and have them pour it for the customer right when they buy it. I bought a black coffee specifically because I wanted it to be quick and I was in the middle of a long road trip but it took at least 5 minutes for the person in the back to bring out the black coffee. Again I do like this place and that's why I give 5 stars. Thank you for offering all the vegan options you do, but maybe consider having the cashier pour the black coffee for customers. Thanks!</text>< name>

<Review>Yassssssssssss. Cameron Park has a place with vegan options. Yay also for gluten free lovers. They're focaccia is fire and ask about the stamp card. Please support this business. I hope they'll continue to add vegan options.<//Review>< Time>

Delicious and Friendly Cafe! I stumbled upon Farmers Deli n' Bakery by chance - maybe it was fate? It was love at first bite. Forget Starbux, buy local, made-with-love coffee, lunch and sweets. You won't be disappointed.</Text>

Recently I ordered 10 loaves of focaccia bread from Farmer's for a large family party. They were a major hit ! Went back yesterday and was again pleasantly surprised. A nice little find in Cameron Park, hope they do well.

Update-
I've continued to eat here off and on for the last few years. Never disappointments. Their baklava is the best I've had.< /text>

I hate to only leave 3 stars, because the employees are nice enough (not overly friendly, but they get the job done) and the sandwich is tasty, but good grief, it's 11 or 12 bucks and it's so small!
I really really wanted to like this place. It's a 5 minute walk to get here, it's locally owned (I think) and it has great reviews. But if I take a 5 minute drive to forklift, I get just as friendly employees and twice the sandwich for the same price and the wait is nowhere nearly as long.
Which leads me to my next point, the wait.
I'm not sure why it takes so long, but plan on at least 10 minutes after ordering, but probably longer. I've been twice now, and as much as it pains me, I probably won't be coming back for the sandwiches.

To the owner who responded:
So I *have* to give you a 5 star review because you think my hard earned money (which matters less than your hard earned money apparently) doesn't afford me an opinion? I'm glad you clearly have a devoted following, and I'm glad they love you. I'm not your target demographic and neither is everyone else, so I can't leave a review that shares things that are important to me because your bread is more important?
I'm not going to let you bully me in to giving a different review like I see you trying to do to other customers.< /text>

I'll start by saying the food is good and the employees are nice. However, paying $11 for a sandwich the length of my hand and waiting 20+ minutes for said sandwich is something I will not be doing again.

Update: HUGE turnoff and sign of poor character to berate customers who give a store an honest opinion that may not be all that flattering or focus on the things the owner finds just absolutely charming about their own business...</review>

The bread and pastries are over the top. Gluten free items and high quality items on the menu as well. So I was surprised when I was served processed turkey on my sandwich that was soooo salty! I couldn't eat it even after waiting over 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches to be made. This was an expensive sandwich and very small. We will come back for pastries and bread to go. Also, no diet beverages or bottled water in the fridge. Only high sugar drinks. Not too happy about the bags of chips which were itty bitty!!!<//text>

So they make an amazing VEGAN chocolate cake!!  And apparently they'll be making sugar free desserts soon. Wow!  I love this place!  The sandwiches are fresh and unique and they have a freezer case with fully prepared items which you can take home and warm up.  Super convenient and nothing is fried.  What an awesome find!< /Text>

I used to love this place well actually it was good the one time I went there and they had their pork sausage. I also love the focaccia bread. I have gone in and called to order at least four times and they never have the pork sausage or any breakfast sausage for that matter. I went in one time at 9 am and was told their sandwich maker wasn’t there so they couldn’t make a sandwich. Like what? I think they’ve been out of sausage since at least November. They have lost a customer for this one. I don’t think I will even go back for the bread since they don’t seem to care that they are always out of sausage.</review>

And if you're going wine tasting, make sure you bring some of their rosemary focaccia bread.  It is outstanding!!

Food made with love is hard to find and that's what they do. I'm a sucker for anything wrapped in a fresh baked pita. If I wasn't on a budget I would have loved to have indulged in the take away items.</review>

I have lived in Cameron Park since 2000 and seen many businesses come and go in this spot. I whole heartedly hope this one stays because delicious, fresh, and notably unique food has never been so accessible! This place is phenomenal, there is so much flavor. Instant happiness on first bite. I hope to see you guys grow and flourish! Thank you for being in Cameron Park!<//review>

Always super nice folks and the rosemary focaccia is hands downs the best I have ever had. Another huge bonus is all the yummy gf items and the grab and go case. They never disappoint!!<//Review>

<Text>I stopped in for a cinnamon roll, and in all honesty I think it was one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had in my life. It was just the right size, and perfectly moist and sweet in every bite with a very decadent sauce.  I'm looking forward to trying out more of the baked goods!< /Text><gmap_id>0x809afa062cb8b64b:0x1b297714b155d939< /gmap_id></record>

The interior is very inviting and the person up front is very friendly and helpful. The Melomakarona cookies and Hungarian apple strudel was amazing, and I'm craving to buy them again. The only complaint I have is that the pastries are a bit expensive, but their taste makes up for that.<//text>

<review>Idk if there's ever been a more misleading rating on a place. For starters it was a hassle to even open up the menu on this website and when I did I'm found with some really pricey foods. Oh well I thought, maybe this place is highly rated for a reason. Wrong, when I got there it felt like a ghost town, I went in and stood by the register for 2 min no greeting no nothing until someone working finally saw me. I finally found something I wanted to try, a chicken wrap or something like that, and ordered it thinking it's ok I'll get my food and eat it here to get the full experience. As soon as I sat down I instantly noticed some debris and like 2 or 3 dead bugs under the table. I nearly vomited. Once I finally got my food I can't complain too much about that because it was fairly decent, not for that price though, because I felt hungry an hour later after eating. I decided today to maybe give it a try again since maybe I was being harsh. Well I get off work only to realize this place closed at 3. And not just today, but every day and they are closed mondays. So how in the world can a place that's open 48 hours a week have good ratings. This place doesn't consider anything for late lunches or early dinners. Just mornings. Open 7-3 is a joke,  those are my everyday 8hr shifts.<//review>< user>

Friendly and helpful,  but tried two gyros and we were very disappointed.  Too much pita bread for amount of fillings,  both pork and lamb meat were tasteless. Taziki sauce was  powerfully overly seasoned with garlic. Can't reconcile to 4.6 rating, very misleading for us.<//text>

I'm so glad I discovered this hidden gem right off the highway - thanks, Yelp! Not only is the food some of the best breakfast and lunch food I've ever eaten, but there were SO many gluten free options! I can't remember the last time I was able to eat pita, falafel, AND carrot cake...and each bite was more delicious than the last! Non-GF people would never know some of the food was GF because it is so fresh and natural. In addition, there were many pre-packaged meals and items available to take home with you. The owners were super friendly, too. I will be stopping on my way to and from Tahoe every time!<//text>

<Review>Update: how had is it to get one order right? A small order at that.
Update: have been there twice since the incidents, they have been able to get my orders a little more accurate, other than giving me the wrong dressing once for my southwest salad.
Went here after a long 4th of July drive from Texas, and screwed up my order. I guess if I want it fixed I should add more drive time after the 26 hours my husband and I have already driven. Just horrible!

<Text>I appreciate the fast service, and I understand how in the busy hours a meticulous presentation is not always possible, but the salad I got there was a hot mess. Y'all are telling me y'all couldn't even pick out the nasty cucumbers and lettuce out of the salad? And where are the tomatoes?

<review>I usually love Jack-in-the-Box but this place was having a bad night. The chicken fajita Pita had like two pieces of chicken in there and they didn’t give us any of the sauces that we wanted and they also shorted us a milkshake. It’s like Joe Pesci said when he played on the movie Lethal Weapon. “They f*€k you in the drive-thru!!”<//review><username>Nick Pulfer< /username>< rating>

Great team but what happened to jack n the box's food? It used to be good. Now amd for a while the food has really gone down hill. Its great for late night after you hit the bar but most american work and are in bed early. Not the worst food out there though.</review>

<Text>This is the 3rd time in different occasions.  All I can say is Friendly customer service is needed . Hailey the employee there is in need of training on customer service . Can not be friendly in the drive-thru with customers is a big disappointment.

Not happy. I waited 15 mins for 2 cars in front of me. I asked for a  chicken tender combo with curly fries fresh by the time i recieved them they were far from fresh. I asked for buffalo 2x and did not recieve it i was given ranch. This is the 3rd time I have come here and not gotten my food properly after waiting in a line for longer than I should have. I dont know if they are under staffed or if the girl at the window just doesnt care. Idk.< /text>

Normal Jack food. Correctly made and fast. Of course I just had the worst experience at a Sonics nearby, where I got cheated out of masonry and left hungry (credit card company is investigating fraud in the mangers part) so this place is a five star restaurant by comparison.</Review>

You forgot to give my door dash driver my drink. Thanks.

Reply to owners comment. Why would I contact door dash about the mistake when it was your guy’s fault. That doesn’t make sense.</review>

Always a treat! If you live near by you receive they're flyers full of great coupons! And if you walk in to order they will let you use as many as you would like at once! Great deals that way!!!
We were able to purchase 4 full meals for  just $26.08! When we usually pay over $40. easy.
So look for your flyers in your mailboxs at home and save enough money to put in 1/2 a tank of gas (at least for my little car)!
Enjoy!

<review>I specifically asked for no manaise, no butter on the sourdough bread and do not toast the bread. When we left the drive through and went on our way. I found out it was all wrong on the way to an appointment. Unfortunately I hadn't eaten, so being hungry and knowing I wouldn't have another chance to eat for 5 hours I had to wipe off the manaise and eat it anyway out of despair. Not a good experience.</review><user>116758223132816336819</user><gmapID>0x80905438e7a68127:0x2e26848e298b63e0<//gmapID><Response>{'time': 1568558101037, 'text': "We're sorry to hear about this experience, Serena.

<Text>Went through the drive-thru on Dec 3, at 6.25pm. We waited a while for our food. We did not mind the wait as we thought our food would be fresh. When we got home a few blocks away, our food was dry and hard as a rock. I was extremely upset as this as this is the the third time this has happened. I called the restaurant to talk to the manager. I told her our sandwich patty was hard as a rock, and the chicken sandwich was dry. She told me that the food was fresh off  the grill. I find it hard to believe as I know the difference between fresh and to long on the grill. I asked her if she would eat something like that, if not,  why would you serve it? She started to argue with an unprofessional tone of voice. I told her that she was lacking manager skills and should not be in that position. I told her I was going to complain to the proper people about this incident and she replied with an attitude "go ahead!' and hung up the phone. I don't like to complain but this was something I feel that should be known.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1565711970977, 'text': "Hi there, this is definitely not the impression we want to leave.

NO MILKSHAKES. EVER. WHY DO YOU HAVE MILKSHAKES ADVERTISED ON THE SIDE OF THE RESTAURANT WHEN THEY ARE NEVER AVAILABLE. THIS APPLIES TO EVERY JACK IN THE BOX IN THE CITY.</Review>

My 10 year old daughter went in here while I was still gathering my things from the car to use the bathroom. The person pointed to a sign that said bathroom is only for customer use. She's 10. If that's how your employees treat a little girl than I decided to take my business elsewhere. Kids have bathroom emergenices all the time. So I drove across the street to McDonald's instead. Not crazy about their food or service but at least my daughter want told she couldn't use the bathroom cause we haven't bought something yet.< /Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>They didn't give me all of my order at the drive thru. Didn't put extra cheese that I paid for on my fajita pita. They actually put NO cheese on it. Some of my food was just thrown in the wrappers. I went back to get the rest of my order. They told me they would bring my order out. I had my grandson with me, he was asleep in his carseat, so I couldn't go inside. I honestly waited 5 minutes for them to bring my food out. They told me they would right out. They weren't, I went through the drive thru again. They weren't overly busy at the time either. I probably won't be going back to that particular store again.< /Review>< Name>

The service here has always been prompt and friendly. The food is standard fare for Jack in the Box, so not much to say on that. But the place is kept clean, the staff is nice, and I’ve not had any problems. A good one to go to in the area.<//Text>

Very unprofessional and messes up orders. Ive had to call and talk to a manager at this location already so mamy times because the food was sloppy or the messed up the order and there rude. Ive also had them refund a few times now for our order. So my last experience was last nite i ordered on the app so my hubby can just go pick it up and they made it so difficult. So i wanted a milkshake with my order instead of a fountain drink but the app doesn't give you that opption so i called and they said yea they can do it when we get there. So my hobby gets there an tells them and they say we don't see the milkshake on the order after we explained to them over n over the app didn't let me. They still didnt get it when it was so simple. Then kept telling my hubby he had to pay when the order was already paid for since we ordered on the app. Then after all that my hubby got home with the food and they still didn't give me a drink with my meal. The tacos where nasty and all soggy and barley had anything in them. We ended up throwing away most of the food cuz it was nasty. So think twice before you go to this location. Then they where telling him they don't have time for this it's like what we paid for our food we just want our order right. But the store manager was really nice and helped with my refund and the manager that was there when i went to pick up my refund she was also nice.< /review>

Good food and a clean location, quiet and friendly service, some items are a little overpriced but that's almost every fast food restaurant now a days. The soda machine is nice and updated but as per my experience some of the flavors are mostly watered down and they really can't be enjoyed at all unless you oder a drink from behind the counter.</Text>

ordered a large curly fry, get home and find that they put only enough to make it a small curly fry in a large fry. call for a straight only to keep getting a busy signal. drive all the way across town back to jack in the box and find out there phone is not working and we had to bring back the fry for a refund. manager was rude. also messed up a a drink, ordered 1 of the meals and the employee asked me if i wanted the meal or the combo when i clearly asked for the #11 with a small drink and large fry. gave me a large drink an charged me for it. told them i ordered a small an they said the large is free an they would refund and never got the refund</Review>

<userid>106752642283476159366<//userid><Review>Terrible service and subpar food. While I dined in, I saw a guy wait extremely long TWICE for his 2 separate orders as if they forgot about him or severely prioritized drive thru during a SLOW night with small line in drive thru. And in that same 30 minute period while I was there, they forgot to give a customer part of his order in the drive thru. Greats customers with much delay when walking up to ordering counter, myself included. Probably the worst JB in the Modesto Area. Won't plan on coming back to this particular one.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80905438e7a68127:0x2e26848e298b63e0<//gmap_id>< resp>

<text>This place is a discrase to the name of jack in the box. 11pm at night  employes all out side smokeing takeing orders and i know not one of them washed there hands befor i got my food at the window. Discusting. Same for the food. Ordered a grilled checken club same as i always do at jack. The bread was not even warm or grilled just cold and gross. For the past few months its been worse and worse. Not to mention there freinds hanging out in cars in the parkimg lot doing who knows what. I hope some maneger up the food chain starts reading theses bad reviews. I love jack some times. But this was the last time im ever going to this location agin. Witch sucks becuse it 0.4 miles from me.  Just close it. Unless you lay off every one it wont change. Oh and no i did not eat my food if thats what you call it. I trough it in the trash on my way out. No way i was telling them what happened even if thay did not spit in it. I could not eat it thinking no one washed there hands after smoking.   This is how the flu spreds so fast.  Be glad you got a job and take some pride in you work. Or go back to school and do something you want.  Your just losseing customers and wont have a job long if this keeps up.   Take it how you want. But dont go to this jack in the box.  And this new guide for google maps dose not mean just leave a good review to get more points. I know i come to this jack a lot and its always well under par compared to meany others. The night crew never makes food right. And called corprate to report this location. But there worse then this place.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The truth is that I do not get used to going to Jack in the box very much.
I thought the hamburger would be good. The cheese looked more like a dressing because it was very liquid ...
