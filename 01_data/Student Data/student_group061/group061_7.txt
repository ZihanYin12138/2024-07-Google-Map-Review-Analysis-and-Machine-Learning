<Review>I am disabled with 15 years prior mechanical/automotive repair experience. I have a full size Ford Econoline handicap equipped van with full hand controls needing a front end alignment after front end damage due to an accident. I spoke with Steve often during the front end steering repair on my van. Steve has great customer service skills and was always quick to provide status and updates involving on each step of service from beginning to end. Manager Louis was very professional and understanding to my concerns as a disabled individual. Louis seemed highly competent and very knowledgeable and was eager to work with me on labor and parts costs. I had been in an accident which caused right front end damage requiring replacement of many parts. Louis took the time to clearly explain and show me what the damaged parts looked like and was very helpful and willing to track down replacement parts and work hard to make sure things worked properly. Gosh Ford Quick Lane did a fantastic front end repair and alignment considering the amount of damage and time required to repair my van. I highly recommend Gosh Ford Quick Lane to anyone seeking trustworthy automotive repair at very reasonable prices.<//Review>< Rating>

Abby is amazing! AAA recommended this shop due to being slightly rear ended. Abby addressed all of my concerns professionally and i will recommend them to anyone I know. If I could rate more stars I would. Can't wait to see the finished product.

Update

Everything turned out great! Thanks to the whole crew at Gosch Ford Collision!</review>

Kayla H. helped me out with my car after a devastating fire. Unfortunately it was a total loss but she really helped me out with explaining this and letting me know how things work when it comes to fire damage. She was really friendly and understanding and I appreciate all her help. I would definitely come back to her if I got into another accident.</Text>

I brought my car in after it got side swiped on the street. They are amazing and fast. Fernando is awesome, he talked me through the entire process and kept in contact with me daily. They estimated about 3 weeks for my car to be done but they got it done in a week. Not that I want another accident but if it happens, I know where I'm going to go</text>

Great experience here. I had my car vandalized and these guy fixed my car up perfect. And they gave her a bath so I got my car back in better shape than before she got beat up. They took great care of me and got my car fixed up ahead of schedule.  They turned a bad situation into a great experience<//text>

Just got my van back today Fernando is awesome and I thank you so very much for working so diligently on my van to get it to me in a timely manner. The manager at the store also schooled me on a few things that we had no knowledge of thank you thank you. These people are just top notch. It was 10 stars from the day I dropped off my van to the day I picked up. Fernando called to up date me 3-4 times on the progress of the vehicle and he just kept me in the loop. If ever you find your self in a jam this is where you take your vehicle they have the best service hands down. Thank you Fernando and thank you to the whole team that worked on my van.<//review>

These guys were great!  Fernando was very professional and Carla made things so much easier.  My Kia had damage to the front end and I checked online for someone that I could trust.  I'm glad I made the decision to have them do the repairs because my car looks great and and I received it several days early. Thanks guys! Great service.< /Review>

< Review>
If it were not for what appears to be excellent body work by Gosch Collision on my vehicle, I would be giving them 1 star. The reason - incredibly poor customer communication / service.

Gosch Collision set a strong expectation of superior customer communication by e-mailing me almost daily reports on the status of my repair until four (4) days before the repair would be completed and the vehicle would be ready for pick up.

When we came to pick up our vehicle, we were informed by the service rep that there was a problem related to paperwork from our insurance company. The rep said he heard about the issue five (note this: FIVE) days before but did not do what was needed to resolve the issue and waited until we arrived to pick up the vehicle. We could have been working on getting the required paperwork from the insurance company FIVE days earlier but the Gosch rep decided not to communicate with us until we came to get the vehicle. The rep said he heard about the issue on Thursday but because he was off on Friday, and he doesn't work on the weekends, and he must have had other things on his mind on Monday, we did not hear about the insurance issue until we came to the Gosch office at 2:00PM. He he made a simply phone call on Thursday, we could have had it all resolved well in advance of the Monday pickup time. I saw a number of other office people at there so even if he were not available to call me, someone esle certainly could have done that.

Of course, even with the rep away on Friday, that did not stop their system from sending us the following note that day that said:

Hi Patrick,

We are nearing completion. If we encounter any delays, we'll call you.

Gosch Collision

So, where was the call their system promised?

My point is - if you decide to set yourself up as practitioners of superior customer communications, then you darn well better deliver.

I did not expect superior communication from a collision company but Gosch created that expectation with their e-mailed communications. Too bad at least one employee was incapable, or unwilling, to deliver on that promise.

We did finally get our vehicle back several hours after showing up at the Gosch Collision office in Hemet and, as I noted earlier, the body work appears to be well done but the poor customer service and lack of critical communication was completely unacceptable.

FOLLOWUP: NOVEMBER 12, 2019

As if to confirm my feelings on poorly handled communication, please see their NOVEMBER 11, 2019 response to my initial comments from 9 MONTHS AGO. Nine months to post an apology. REALLY?? Honestly, as far as I am concerned, you would have been better off not commenting back at all.<//Review>

< Review>
I was in an accident on 8/28 and my car arrived at the collision center on or about 8/29. I was always in the know thanks to Fernando Esquer. He listened when I said I wanted to keep my car and was able to make that happen. Not only that, he gave me a pick up date of 9/20...today is 9/13 and I just got home WITH my beautiful car!! Who says Friday the 13th is a bad luck day? Thank you Fernando and ALL of the Gosch Collision team. You guys are awesome!!< /Review>

I just picked up my Malibu, aka Malibooboo, since it had to make a visit at my expense. Thomas Frazier was excellent, just do not like to meet under these circumstances. Third time within 5 years. However, no complaints. My 'booboo looks like new, the paint blends amazing, and customer service is thorough and friendly throughout the entire process. Thank you Gosch Auto Collision Center.</Review>

I have been holding off on this review to see if my situation would be rectified, but after several attempts it has not been addressed.
I had some damage to my SS Camaro repaired here; hood and fender painted and front bumper replaced.  The responsible party was paying for the damage which I was initially told would be fine for them to call in the payment once the work was complete, only to find out late on Friday afternoon that the payment had to come from me.  This caused a delay and extra expenses for a rental over the weekend.
I get the car back and the paint looked great but driving home my car started to run badly and my check engine light came on.  After an initial inspection, I found the MAF sensor unplugged.  Okay, no big deal, I plugged it in and problem solved.  After about a month, I finally noticed that the Camaro emblem was not replaced on the fender that was painted.  I called Gosch Collision and left a message for Carlos asking if he had any letters laying around there and asked him to call me back to resolve the issue.  I work out of town and it is very difficult for me to get there during business hours.
Finally I took a day off and went in there in person to talk to Carlos.  He stated that he never received my voicemail.  I showed him the missing emblem and asked why I did not receive any touch up paint as the paint on the bumper and fender was very thin and I had some rock chips to cover up.  Carlos stated that he would talk to his manager about the emblem and get me some touch up paint and call me once he confirmed.
No call, nothing.
I bought my car from Gosch Auto Group so naturally I wanted to get it repaired here because it was close to my house.  Lesson learned.< /text>

Gosch Collision and Tom my estimator did an amazing job fixing my car. I had damage on the front bumper and working with them was a great experience. They have a Keurig in the waiting room if you need a tasty brew while your there. Throughout the repair process they give you text updates on your car. Very happy with Gosch Collision! I highly recommend to anyone looking for a great body shop!!< /Text>

Matthew Gabriel and Karla Perez provides me with great customer service and helped me out with a estimate to repair my vehicle after someone hit me in a parking lot. Will definitely recommend to all my family and friends if they need repairs done!</text>

<Review>This is what happens at this location, when you order "extra cheese."
I paid 40$ for a two topping pizza with "extra cheese.'
This is obviously NOT "extra cheese."
Employee attitude was, less than desirable.
The table we sat at was sticky.
The only thing I liked about this restaurant, was the OG stained glass windows from the original restaurant design.
Save your money, go someplace else.
Or if you're really craving Round Table, go down the street to the Felton location.
Round Table is really overpriced in my opinion.
I also cannot help but notice that the price tends to vary from one location to another and this one in particular is rather inflated.< /Review>< name>

Past times I've ordered here, the staff were all very friendly and nice. And it's amazing pizza, really good option for parties. However, this time picking up my order, I was seen coming in, stood at the front register for 5 minutes without being helped, only 1 family was there already eating. So I looked behind the higher counter to get someone's attention, I was ignored as 2 employees were in the middle of a casual conversation... I waited til a pause and asked for my order.

Normally this'd be fine by me, no big deal. But when I let the cashier know I'd been waiting there 5 minutes, her 1st instinct was to argue: "Okay well you need to be here at the register." "I was." "Oh, sorry".

I'd have taken my $6 tip to her back if I could. It's not the customer's job to be seen, it is the employees job to see the customer and serve them. I am paying you.</Text>

<Name>P Largo<//Name><user>115376166905621573001</user><Text>What happened to Round Table Pizza? We asked the "Manager" who took our order if they had basil and she said "YES" our pizza came and it looked odd I thought where's the basil? Thinking it must be under everything! The manager thought we said "BACON" we were so hungry that we didn't notice all those little squares were bacon we assumed it was pepperoni? We ate one slice each before I questioned what it was? Anyway instead of apologizing the Manager proceeded to ARGUE with us for 10 minutes when we were telling her we said basil... She insisted we said BACON which doesn't even sound like basil! Near closing time we didn't want another pizza! We had taken all the little pieces of bacon off! We were very unhappy because we don't eat bacon by the time we were done arguing she asked us what we wanted we just wanted to leave and asked if we could just get a coupon for a free  pizza next visit! She agreed and said ok let me get that for you! She came back with a 20% off coupon! WOW! We can get that online! Needless to say this female Manager is not only the most UNFRIENDLY manager ive ever met, she's the rudest and most argumentative manager I ever met! She does NOT have good customer services skills nor does she know what it means to be a good manager! We spent 50.00 for a large pizza and two beers! That's not exactly cheep! So they can keep their 20% off coupon because we will NOT be eating there again! This location just lost TWO customers.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>RAN OUT OF CHEESE!!! Drove all they way there and then was told to wait which I did for 20 mins only to find out they had no cheese which meant they had no pizza. Would have been really nice to let me know that before I ordered. So that was a whole hour of my life I'm not getting back and I still have no food.

I take time to reflect on my experiences over time in order to prevent writing in frustration or without considering the perspective of employees of the service industry.

The TL;DR version goes like this: Over the last month or 2 I've ordered the same pizza 5 times. They have gotten the order wrong 4 times, but when confronted they try to make it right. 3 stars is fair because the food is good and the staff is cooperative when they error. But I don't understand what's so difficult about putting the correct toppings on a pizza when the toppings appear on the receipt and presumably get communicated to the staff.

Full Version (if anyone is interested):

I order a specialty pizza - The Italian Garlic Supreme - and I tend to get it delivered because I'm originally from a small town that didn't have any restaurants with delivery services, so having food brought to my door is still a novelty.

The pizza usually arrives without the green onions, a topping that is included standard with this pizza. The first time this happened I let it go. I figured, "meh, probably training someone, whatever". The second time I order it - a week later - Same issue. I called them up to let them know this happened twice now and they offered me a discount on the pie. Cool. Third time...same issue except while ordering I ask if they have the green onions and get verbal confirmation that they'll make it on the pie. When the pizza arrived without them I called again and they offered to send the driver back out with the onions in a plastic cup. I thought that was kind, but it was already 9pm, I hadn't eaten since breakfast, I had to work the next day, and I didn't want to wait up and let my pizza get cold, so I declined and was offered a free pizza next time I ordered. I accepted.

Fast forward: I try to redeem my free pizza and its a different manager who is suspicious and doesn't understand why that would happen, and treats me like I'm trying to pull something because the previous manager didn't leave a note like she said she would, but they give me the free pizza and it's perfect! Yum!

Most recently: I think I have it figured out. I ask for EXTRA Green Onions. That's right! if they don't put their standard topping on their own pizza I'll draw their attention to it! Didn't work. Pizza arrived tonight without green onions. I'm starting to feel like they're screwing with me. I call back and admittedly was a bit rude - They asked me if I could hold and I was like "No!" - and was offered a free pizza next time, but after my last experienced I declined and they gave me this one free.

I'm not trying to be unreasonable, but I know what I want. And according to their MENU I should be able to have it. Further, when you're spending $30 on a pizza you want to get what you want.

Overall, the food is good and the people are friendly, but getting what you order is not easy. And if you can, pick up is better. When you order delivery they say 45 minutes to an hour, but in my experience its usually a little over an hour and the pizza is sometimes luke-warm.</text>

I have ordered delivery about 6 times in the past 4 months  (June).  On the 3 of those occasions, the driver delivered the wrong pizza.  Each time, they delivered my pizza to someone else.  One of those times, the driver went back to his car 2-3 times and kept coming back with a different of orders, just not mine.<//review>

<review>Superbly friendly staff, and very attentive to my order. I asked for an X-large pizza, with 2/3rds with veggies and 1/3 plain cheese, floppy not crusty, and a little more than "little cheese", but "not regularh cheese" - they got it right perfectly! And to top it off, no pun intended in a pizza place, the staff person was super attentive about giving me plates and napkins. What a great place!< /review>< rate>

Ordered a Maui Zaui with ham to go, I didn't check before leaving, noticed I received a vegetarian after i got home. I called to complain, gave them my order number from the receipt, was told there was no order for that number even know the box said the same order. They asked what was on the pizza,  I described the ingredients, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, 2 pieces of pineapple, was interrupted and was told it was a Maui Zaui. I once again explained only 2 pieces of pineapple and no ham, so a vegetarian. What ever happened to customer service. Kind of rude to be told I'm wrong.</Review>

<Review>I had a very disappointing experience.  We ordered pizza to feed 69 people for a company meeting. The pizza was delivered 30 min late and luke warm (even though we are a 5 min drive from the restaurant). In addition, they did not deliver enough plates and forks. I do not recommend using them for catering, as they are clearly unreliable.< /Review><rating>2< /rating>< Date>

What a beautiful settings this place offers. Indoor or outdoors the accommodations are pleasant, chill out music is perfect for the mood.

The menu is enough to please anyone. Breathtaking views overlooking the area below.

The weather seems perfect at night as well. Definitely recommend to make a trip even if you do not stay at Ritz Carlton.</text>

<Review>Awesome place to have mid-afternoon drink in outstanding environment.

Valet parking is complimentary. Each and every staff member was engaging and welcoming.

Drinks aren't cheap, but you are paying for more than the drink.

Keep up the good work.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNJo7Y-qYcjkAHTkvlQfG2a8s0S78jQ0MNNOpJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuBkyuqMMxhQROb65oghSZuWVF7IniV0dIEMr9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh_PLeAyxahSjKxUlhOftyI6mnNWrok6AYGbtr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1WW7ZeQvsUWzuUCzvDJPGBo4SYUOdNa3rV7-7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVgLfWFJFFfmzCUGNG_SZbbRnmmELZKCLo-pxM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYNYjQUvtq5clmVGaRqZ4PuXkDTttx5M3uFNAV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv7F2soVrDa0xZblOwLL2pA7C2Z6_w06qemcg9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>State Fare is the Best. Incredible food, cocktails, beer, service & views. Top notch. Of course you're at the Ritz Carlton. You've arrived. And you are welcomed with open arms from the valet to the hostess stand and beyond. You deserve it!</Text>< Pics>

Place was awesome. Music, staff and the vibe were on point. Food was so good and they have many options for vegans. Happy hour was nice the prices are good. Good for big groups and just to chill with good people.</Review>

<Text>The Turkey burger was delicious. I enjoyed it so much I ordered it the next day. The only critique I have is the kitchen took a while to get the Turkey burger out.  I sat there for almost 35mins after ordering before I got the burger and it wasn't busy or at peak lunch service either.  Other than that the food and presentation was great!</Text>< pics>

There are many things that make an experience amazing. First of all was the great service from Ariel, she was super tentative and had great suggestions. Within a few short moments our food was presented to us an had so much flavor. We had the Fresh Cheese and Charcuterie and Avocado Fries. My wife and I enjoyed the Bleu cheese and fig spread on a cracker. We also had a wild berry lemonade and IPA while lounging back and enjoying the stars. Speaking of which, we enjoyed some nice stargazing the resort provides on Fridays and Saturdays. Right below the lounge area there are nice stone and grassy paths to enjoy a nice walk.  For a nice and romantic evening, make a reservation.  Worth the time.</Text>

I have a bunch of food intolerances which make it hard to eat out. My husband and I stayed at the Ritz for our anniversary and went to the restaurant to see if they could accommodate me. From the hostess to the waiter to the chef they were so helpful and didn't make me feel bad at all. The chef made me a meal specific to my allergies and it was delicious. We were both very happy with our food, the service, and atmosphere in general (live music) and would definitely go back.</Review>

The Ritz-Carlton and it's views are amazing. The food and bar service was spectacular. The appetizers, menu and desserts we're basic...yet expensive... If I rate the Ritz 5 stars. If I rate the food and bar by state fare 3 stars...<//Text>

<text>Very nice restaurant. If you're seated inside and it's just two of you, request the half circle booth facing the view. Sitting outside is lovely. One can get plenty from the bar menu. Really enjoy sitting outside having a beverage and a bite from the bar menu. Quite affordable. Be sure to get your valet parking ticket validated at State Fare if you eat or drink something there.</text>< Name>

<Review>A very nice place to visit. There are nice shops with Native Indian trinkets, etc, as well as a restaurant and coffee shop. They take group photos of you early on and you can purchase them at the top.They also have a nice bar.</Review></record>

We are locals and try to go either Fri or Sat night when they have live music. But that aside, the food is AMAZING. We have taken loads of people there and no one has been disappointed ever. The burger is off the charts. The scallops are fantastic. And believe it or not, they have a gluten free pita bread that is so delicious, many people prefer it to regular bread. They are extremely accommodating for substitutions as well (like for example, having half sweet potato and half regular fries). Love that they use organic/locally sources when possible. That's what brought us there to start, but the quality of the food and the ambience kept us there.<//Review>

Very disapointed with overall service during the New Year’s Eve “Party”. The personnel  was impolite, rushing us to order and didn’t show up for refills or new orders. Also, lacking any decorations for proper celebration. No atmosphere whatsoever; band left abruptly minutes after midnight. Our group of 15 people felt cheated.</Text>

Food is delicious and well done. A standout restaurant, hotel or no. Burger is great and best salad knocks it out of the park. Service is also excellent. Views in the morning for breakfast not bad either. We ate here twice during our stay - and we almost never eat at hotel restaurants.< /text>

<review>Lunched here recently and was greatly disappointed. The views are nice and the service was pleasant but slow. The food is way overpriced and very so-so. Avocado toast with two eggs for $19 and though the eggs were supposed to be soft boiled, they arrived hard-boiled. Meh.<//review>< Pictures>

A Wonderful place for special occasions or just any occasions. The ladies and gentlemen at the Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage always exceed your expectations even for such a luxurious property,   they don't just treat you as a guest they treat you like family.< /Text>

Decent food, phenomenal service staff, management of the restaurant can use some better planning. Here where stuff (not staff) can improve super slow kitchen, greeting staff must be trained to engage people very fast and not let them linger, always face incoming traffic and not be positioned back towards people walking up.  Did I mention that the staf is phenomenal?<//Text>

<time>1556917315181<//time><name>R SKMT<//name><Review>(Translated by Google) I recommend the smoked salmon pizza of this store. Very well-matched with a little spicy marinade sauce, celery and leek bitterness accentuate moderately. Watch the pool from the heights of the hot desert and join with the cold iced tea.

<text>Inspector (David Nguyen) was very professional and courteous. A thorough inspection was performed with details, diagrams, and photographs. A full report is provided online promptly (<24hrs) and downloadable as a PDF. Explanation/summary at the end of the inspection by David was immensely helpful as a first time home buyer. I will have my sister use his services if and when she will be able to buy a home.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2cd6ccf8eebf5:0x765ca342fa40b23d< /gmap_id></record>

I was not at the inspection, but my co-buyer said that David was very professional, punctual,  polite and friendly.  David's inspection report is comprehensive, very thorough, and easy for me to understand.  I highly recommend David if you need a home inspection done.< /review>

Had inspection with David for my first home.  It is a 1950s home that needed alot of work.  David was knowledgeable and very thorough and happily answered the many questions I had.  I felt like I was in good hands and would definitely use David's services again for any other home.< /Review>

Ali was amazing. Morrison Plus helped us out in a bind and came to inspect a potential property purchase within 24 hours notice AND on a Sunday of a holiday weekend. Ali was super helpful in explaining to us what he found and what he saw. The only issue is that we didn't fully understand one of the home issues until we read the report. (We wish we had been explained one section a bit more.) But over all we are thrilled and will recommend them to anyone in the future. !!< /Review>

<text>David was super knowledgeable and informative during our home inspection. New to the Southern California area, he made us feel at ease about the condition of the property by going into detail about what he saw and gave us his assessment. David was very patient with us and answered  the numerous questions we had about our almost 100 year old home. He was very professional and detail oriented. We were happy with the quality of the final report he submitted which was very comprehensive. We would feel comfortable recommending to anyone.< /text>< user_name>

<Review>David Nguyen was great. He was very thorough in his report and took the time to explain many of the important things. As a first time home buyer we were very inexperienced and appreciated the extra attention. Scheduling was easy and the price was fair. I would recommend David and Morrison inspections to anyone who is buying a home and needs inspections.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>The inspector was clean and courteous and very thorough. The report showed many details of our property that should be valuable to the next owner, both positive and negative. The report gave a fair qualitative analysis of the condition of our 60 year old home that was updated 20 years ago.  The sewer inspection service was a relief that all the pipes were clear and intact. I would not hesitate to hire Morrison Plus again.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2cd6ccf8eebf5:0x765ca342fa40b23d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>David, the inspector, did a very thorough inspection of my brand new built home. The builder company wanted to screw us and not take care of some issues like broken tile on the roof, electric outlets, etc. However, David caught these issues, and we had them fixed by the builder before we moved in. Apparently the builder has their own inspector, which is obviously biased and they don’t ever want to fix anything. He’s honest and very friendly! I highly recommend him! 👍🏼</Text><date>1603391519010</date></record>

<Review>David was awesome, he was professional, on time and went over with us home buyer of all the big things that he finds. And I mean he finds a little water damage of a dark corner that only a experienced and detail inspector can find. And his report is concise but also detail. I would recommend David to anyone that needs an inspection.< /Review>< gmapID>

As a real estate professional I have worked with many home inspectors. David with Morrison Plus is THE best I have had the pleasure of working with. Reports, same day. Pricing, the best in the industry. Punctuality, always 15 minutes early. Availability, most of the time same day!David is also an all around great guy. I'm lucky to have come across him and trust him complicity.< /review>

Morrison Plus (David) is the best home inspector I have ever worked with. I'm a loan officer so I see many home inspection reports and I wouldn't go with anyone else. He is very thorough and does not skip any corners... he will crawl into small places to make sure nothing is missed. Clients who I have referred to David has had nothing but great things to say about him< /Review>

David was referred my a friend of mine. He was very professional. He arrived early and was very thorough with our inspection. Post-inspection, he took the time to explain the biggest issues that should be addressed right away. He eased our concerns and really broke down all the “technical” language to help us understand it all. He was available for calls and questions afterward and our agents even continued to use him for other clients. I highly recommend David and Morrison Plus Property Inspections!<//text>

My 1st home inspector was great but David went above and beyond my expectations! Not only was he thorough, he provided a lot of information and estimates of how much things would cost to repair. This helped me out as a potential buyer so I didn't have to call around. He's almost like a one stop shop! Highly recommend!</review>< pics>

David has been great in the process of finding our forever home for our growing family. We initially thought we had all the check boxes marked, made an offer, then inspections. David found that this first house did not seem structurally sound but it was up to us to make that final decision. We were frustrated because we’ve already seen so many homes but ultimately made the right decision and moved on. We eventually found another home in which David thoroughly inspected and he thought with the right contractor we could end up with a beautiful home. We got the house, started construction and David offered to “check-up” on our process whenever he got the chance. He has been so helpful and saved us a lot of time, money, and headaches by telling our contractor to correct small details they missed. David has been the most hands on inspector I’ve seen and encourage any home buyer, home owner, realtor, contractor, or builder to use his services. Thanks David!</Text>

Millions thank you to David Nguyen! Very knowable and professional. Spent more than 2 hrs on a 1500 sqft house in Laguna beach. He even brought a professional pest guy to give us a complimentary report. Really appreciate his hard work during covid19 pandemic time.

Lindy is always great when it comes to our taxes! Always explains everything and always understanding of us! She cares about her clients and if there's a way to make my taxes better for me next year, she always tells me before I leave the office! And the people are always nice and friendly at this location and always helpful.< /text>

Everything was very good with the tax professional I had.and I feel like she knows the tax laws, has years of experience and I was confident she was doing a good job for me.  She was also very friendly and professional.  I have come to H&R for years and feel quite confident in the service I get from them. I always get the peace of mind as well.< /review>

I have been coming to H&R block for many years and feel I get very good care and information and that my taxes are very well taken care of.  My representative, Lindy Stribling, always treats me with respect and is always informative and very helpful. I feel I get the best possible work done with her and H&R Block.< /Text>

A lot of dog owners don't clean up after their dogs. The lawn is full of dog waste. There is a pet area but most of them don't use it. They don't care about this place.<//Review>

<Text>A nice small park in between loft ...I guess it s ok for a little doggy exercise. Playground is gated and good for toddlers,children after 4 probably need a little more room .There s no restroom in or nearby. Potty trained children def need a restroom in the or nearby the playground . Security is on site at all times and got to say this little park is always very clean. August music in the park program makes downtown summer a little sweeter</Text>< Pictures>

It's out of the way, quiet, and very clean. Good place to take your pet, your children, and enjoy the moment. There is grass and certainly would be picnic perfect. Spring Street Park is fenced in except for the entrance to the park.</text>

The place has always been nice , guards do their duties . For the ones batching and Nagging of the security? Unless you know the duties of the guard please be quiet! As for homeless guards can only ask them to leave if they are harassing or trying to set up to sleep with belongings or doing drugs . The maintenance for cleaning does their early morning cleaning and as for having dogs on leashes it says it's specifically to do so . Go cry a river some where else please< /text>

It's a really cute little neighborhood park, but unfortunately due to its proximity to skid row it tends to have a significant homeless presence that tends to detract from the overall experience.<//text>

Wonderful park for a picnic, to walk your dogs or just relax. There is always security in the park as well. It is cleaned every morning and it opens at 7am. Closing times vary  depending on time of the year. During the summer it is open until 7pm.< /text>

Not a bad spot, relatively speaking. It would be nice with a book on a weekend or something, if you didn't want to go as far as Grand Park. I go here for my dog's sake; and the dog run is really, really small and tends to be dirty. I do not recommend it for dogs.< /review>

The doggy area basically is useless because the security guard walks over to let you know to leash your dog while its there.( ????) Why bother having an enclosed area for dogs If they need to be leashed? Kinda defeats the whole purpose, no?   That and the fact the place has the most nauseating stench from urine soaked sand.  hasnt been changed/sanitized in forever. Better of walking them then risking potential parasites from the filth. Sorry spring st park...</Text>

I was answering my phone and put my cup of coffee down next to me and the security guard walks by and say's. Make sure you pick up that cup. Rude fake security Mf. Then as I walk out I told him he needs to get off his phone and do his job opposed to punking an affluent gentlemen.< /text>

Meh.

Any park that is mainly concrete or pavement is not a park; it's a re-purposed parking lot.

Though the developers who helped create this park claim it is mainly for children, it is not child friendly. There's a small corner of the park with "toddler playground" equipment, but it is not grassed in, the creator or designer chose to use a cushy foam instead. The play equipment is actually pretty good, too bad the designers decided to make the rest of the park look like an outdoor conference room.

Though the intent was to have an area adults and children could play in and around, dogs outnumber children 20:1. The grassy knoll adjacent to the playground is fenced off indefinitely. It looks nice, but it fails in its original intent, fails in its most useful purpose (a dog park) and fails as any sort of park. There aren't even any decent shade trees and it is certainly not restful.

If taxpayer dollars helped create this area the public was bilked.</Text>

Terrible park. The smell of urine is everywhere. If you dig urban NYC experience than this is home.< /review>

The park was just opened this year so it's still unknown to most people unless you live in the neighborhood. The park doesn't have much, there's a small water fountain, children's play ground, seats, drinking fountain, & a lot of grass for walking dogs. I think it's main purpose was a dog park & there's always someone with a dog but all the dogs I've encountered have been tame & friendly</text>

(Translated by Google) The day I went (mid-August, at noon) there were open-air concerts. Very good atmosphere.

This post office is extremely unprofessional. Instead of working they are harassing citizens outside. As a Public Employee you should know how to be professional you should know how to treat people in the seats such unprofessional behavior is disgusting< /text>

What horrible, disrespectful, rude, belittling and condescending customer service. They would not accept my package claiming that I needed a new label since it had the previous days date. Both an older lady and young man kept telling me that they would not take my package and even if they did they would not provide me with a receipt/proof of drop off. That my package would not be delivered and will only be sent back to. The older woman kept say "I'm not taking it. I'm not taking it." While rolling her eyes at me and pretending to sort stamps. The guy jumped in "it has yesterday's date so we can't take it. We need a new label with today's date. I can guarantee you that even if we take it  the package will only be returned to you". Woman quickly chimed in "I'll take it but I won't give you a receipt for it" still rolling her eyes at me. At that point I grabbed my package and left.

Well... Guess what? I handed it to my mail man.and he said it doesn't matter. As long as it's paid for and the date isn't before the ship on date then it's not an issue. I just checked tracking and the package is well on its way.

Avoid this office at all cost. I will be submitting a complaint shortly.</Text>

<Review>I got mail misplaced by one of the ghetto workers to another house and for a week they were disputed that I had it but I called consumer affairs they checked the tracking where it was given my packages and it clearly said that was given to someone else it was about $500 dollars. Then they told me to file lost/stolen package for even tho it was them misplaced it. A week later they got back to me after calling customer service and waiting for hours. Rhonda Lee one of the worst workers ever she said to send her invoice she got it then said I never said it week later. Then I put complaint on worker who dropped it off then to Rhonda Lee poor work skills and attitude (not sure how she got job) she's the most ghetto person I met and I live in watts ca. Then I try to reason with her calling her 4-5 times weekly see what's going on nothing she was giving run around and I finally talk to her supervisor and she said she call me tommarow nothing she swore in god she left voicemail but nothing so I got lucky I talk to Prada and got money back through them be careful if u live in watts get cameras or p.o. box they will say it's delivered sometimes I think is a inside job be careful who u choose for delivery customer  service is worst is like talking to 3rd world country workers lazy w a attitude then they called me N word. I told em that I am not N. Am a human being stop trying to put me down. Most ignorant workers I give em F- not sure how they are still open the Americans should investigate allbussines in watts make sure they are up to date w all regulations!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Incredibly rude staff and terrible service. They don't help you and treat customers extremely badly, being borderline hostile and aggressive. If you have any grievances or questions, don't expect any understanding from the workers. You will be treated as if you are a waste of their "precious" time instead of a customer or even a human being. If possible, try to avoid this place entirely.<//Review><Rate>1</Rate><resp>None<//resp>< user>

Extremely terrible service. If there was a bar on how bad you could serve a customer the employees here just dropped it lower.
I came in to get a money order, I was literally waiting at the desk for 10mins. The women were having full blown conversations in front of me, one of them kept looking back at me the whole time and I kind of got the impression that she wanted me to go away the way she stared at me. After 10mins of listening to incoherent babbling she came came over asked me what I needed in a hostile tone while rolling her eyes, told her I needed a money order I SWEAR the way she looked at me after, I felt like I was going to be punched. Something needs to be done nobody should be treated like this. It just baffles me the way this woman acted, I'm definitely not going back.<//text>

They lack customer service skills, very rude. They are older ladies that still roll their eyes at you, its almost as if they hate their job. I don't understand why they still let these women work there. There's a lady named ernie, very pleasant, wish I would see her everytime I had to go in.< /Text>

The post office people here are rude, have terrible tones to their voices, deliver your mail and packages all over the place. The post office needs to rotate these people. I drive to other post offices.</Text>

<Review>Woman are so rude.  No customer service . I went in to buy a stamp and she kept rolling her eyes. Shrugging,  and having a full convo with her coworker. While I was standing there. I guess the supervisor is the same way if nothing is changing them.......< /Review>< Pictures>

BLOWN AWAY! Recently stayed at The Paso Market Walk Lofts for a girls getaway, and everything was perfect. We appreciated the complimentary wine at check-in, and the service was extremely friendly. The rooms are new and fresh, with a trendy, luxurious vibe. The bed and bedding is super++++ comfy, and the bath products smelled amazing. The bakery and coffee shop downstairs, with plenty of outdoor seating under the oak trees, really knocked this place out of the park. Look forward to coming back ASAP!< /Text>

5-Stars All Around! I would give 6 if I could. We had the chance to stay in two of the lofts at Paso Market Walk, a two bedroom perfect for a family stay and a one-bedroom studio. Both units we amazingly curated and extremely comfortable, not to mention with great proximity to everything downtown Paso has to offer. That said, everything you could ever need is right downstairs at the Paso Market Walk from delicious baked goods at JustBakedSlo, an amazing Ramen bar, and a super convenient coffee shop. Jill the host is incredibly responsive and available to assist with anything needed during our stay and she was even kind enough to leave a fantastic bottle of local cab from Austin Hope for us to enjoy.</Review>

<review>Paso Market Walk was a wonderful way to spend the afternoon. Dragging my husband downtown was the plan!. Boy, he enjoyed the market so much.. Such friendly clerks in all the stores. Wide selection of gifts, plants, beverages and food items. We settled for a shared rueben sandwich from the Third Degree and a flight of ciders from Slo Cider. The servers were very helpful and pleasant while we narrowed down our choices.  Sitting across from Just Baked, we couldn't resist a sweet treat before leaving.
We stopped by 15 degree wine bar to oogle the wine and cheese boxes being prepared for a special wine event tonight. Wish we had more time! Every reason to come back to this wonderful addition to Paso. Well done.  FYI,  there are 6 lofts for rent on the property for those looking for unique and upscale lodging.<//review>< Pictures>

There product is good but I will never return to the market. They have no customer service and will avoid U won’t help U or ask if u need help.
The employees were having a conversation as I’m standing at the register. They looked at me and then looked away and then when I was walking away decided to ask if I needed help and apologized but it was to late. If u have time to stand and be ignored then this is the place for U.</Text>

I love coming to Paso Market Walk for yummy food, awesome coffee, and other goodies.  It is also pet friendly so I LOVE bringing my furry babies here where I can enjoy all the outdoor dining space.  Whenever I have friends in town, it is definitely a place I take them to because there are so many options, whether it be ramen, a sandwich/burger/salad, gelato, beer, wine, even a specialty vegan cheese place. The whole place is super clean throughout which is very important to me.</review>

So far, i am very impressed with our new Market Walk. I stopped in to see what was there and what it was all about.  Several groups were enjoying meals outside.
Vendors are inside and currently run the gamut from coffee to dessert,  with many options in between.  Lacking time, i sampled (and subsequently bought) items from Vreamery, offering surprisingly delicious vegan cheese items, and a yummy bakery called Just Baked.
Definitely check it out. It's great of a lunch or casual dinner.<//review>

Joe Bella we will be regulars at and the Wine Merchant will now be our new happy hour place. The hospitality, grounds and overall charm is a great representation of our little community! We even got to chat with the manager Jill, who was such a delight and you could tell that her whole heart is in this project.  Thank you for keeping Paso alive!<//text>< Pics>

<review>The Lofts at the Market Walk offered the ideal Paso experience. We opted for a two-bedroom suite, where we stayed with a couple friends, and it was the perfect amount of space for us. Everything from the kitchen area and living room to bedrooms and bathroom was comfortable, chic and well appointed — more personable and spacious than a hotel and better appointed than an Airbnb. Jill was an exceptional host and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The location of The Lofts was perfect for exploring all that Paso has to offer, while the quality and assortment of vendors at the Market Walk itself had something for everyone throughout the day —  delicious coffee and breakfast at Joebella, excellent wines and beers at Paso Wine Merchant, tasty ramen at Momotaro and yummy desserts from Just Baked. Can’t recommend The Lofts and Market Walk enough, and we’re already looking forward to returning.</review>< pictures>

I absolutely love the Paso Market Walk!  There is something for everybody and such a great place to meet up with friends or to stop by for  a quick grab and go. Whether it be to get a perfect cup of espresso or tea from Joebella Coffee, a variety of delicious options from Third Degree Grill for lunch or a glass of wonderful Rava champagne and a cheeseboard at The Wine Merchant while listening to live music, this is such a wonderful atmosphere full of nice, hardworking people that love what they do.  Just one thing, don't forget to stop by Just Baked for some incredible baked goods!  I only mentioned a few of the amazing things that the PMW offers so go see for yourself all the rest of the greatness!<//Text>

Paao Market Walk features some of the beat businesses SLO county has to offer in a more modern take on a mall/food court. A massive outdoor seating area provides functionality and has comfortable views of the lovely houses on spring street. If you don't know what you're looking for, or even if you want to visit a business that is fortunate enough to be there, then I know you will have a pleasant experience.</Text>

Super overpriced and little healthy, gluten free options. No affordable options at all.

On top of that, this entire place was not covid safe at all, only half of the workers wore masks, and no one enforced masks at all! Even management was not wearing masks, wrecklessly spreading a disease that could kill people. Really tired of people like this. But at least the custodians were doing a great job of keeping the bathroom and common spaces clean.

The only place that felt friendly in a real way was the vegan cheese shop and Joebella cafe. The bakery and the big guy at the noodle shop were especially bad vibes. Everything I tried at the bakery made me feel nauseous because it was all so overly sweet. Couldn't taste any flavor besides sugar.

And the big guy at the noodle shop would glare at me as I tried to relax, drink some coffee and get some work done on my computer. Was he upset I didn't get noodles? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ well... where I come from ramen doesn't cost $22 before tax, it costs about $3 and that's in NYC! Also I'm gluten free so there was actually no option for me anyway! Wish he didn't have to make me feel uncomfortable in my skin every time I went there.

The music selection is also really terrible. Can't hang out in there for long without headphones. I've heard many people complain about it, including some workers. It must be hell to have to listen to these 5 bad songs on repeat all day every day.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely a gem. Had lunch with my girlfriend at Momotaro Ramen.  We sat right outside at a teak table by a majestic oak tree in a spot of sunlight...it was divine all around..Brittney, one of the owners of Momotaro,, took care of us. So knowledgable...I had their house made Kim Chi ramen, my girlfriend had their signature Momotaro ramen. And Brittany turned me onto an exquisite unfiltered not  too sweet saki. This is a must experience. The ramen, the food court, the surrounding grounds.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1618957890518, 'text': 'Hey Kaitilin - thank you!'}<//Resp>< GmapID>

Very cool place. Just opened on August 1, 2020. I love Montello Tasting room!! I originally purchased Olive oils and Balsamic Vinegar from their location in Cambria, Ca. While visiting family in Paso Robles, I found out they opened in this new location and had stock up! My favorite is the White Truffle Olive Oil, Garlic Balsamic & Fig Balsamic Vinegar. The owner (husband) was very friendly and nice. I will definitely be there again to purchase more now that they're closer.<//text>

{'time': 1618942028378, 'text': 'Hi Brandon, sorry you didn\'t have a good experience at Paso market Walk. We worked very hard to build, lease, beautify and proudly provide jobs for the hard working people who make it happen on our campus. All of the merchants are "mom and pop" shops if you will, and fulfilling dreams they envision. Products are freshly made, handpicked and less a plastic product bag. Blood, sweat and tears went into every aspect of this property - and in this day and age we live on reviews and "stars."  We encourage shop local and support small business. The prices may be "higher" than fast food or middle of the grocery store, but you\'re supporting the small guy and that is who we strive to support. We are not looking to trap anyone, and appreciate the tourism our community envelopes. They bring a lot of revenue to our wonderful city...but thank you for your feedback! Have a great day.'}</Resp>

< Review>
Just recently visited family in Paso and was told that, “YOU HAVE TO GO and check out the Paso Market Walk!” ... They were not wrong and I was not disappointed! The food and venders inside the building are all top notch (I ate the Goat Cheese & sautéed onion burger from The 3rd Degree, 10/10 recommend). The Paso Market Walk is as beautiful on the outside as it is on the inside, wether you’re a local or coming from out of town to visit Paso Robles this place needs to be on your list of things to do!</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>So mid March and this place is not even finished. the site, the pictures, and the news all said it was to open in February even their Facebook posts Imply that they are open . The buildings and pictures on their site look real and If you were from out of town like we are you would assume  it's open already. Highly disappointed.  There needs to be an opening date on the site.<//review>< pics>

Great service... great price....fit me in on a Sunday afternoon and if you know anything about smog checks... NO ONE does them on Sundays! Comfortable seating area even though we were in and out in less than 25 minutes... would highly recommend their services and would use them again!< /text>

<Review>I just moved to California and needed a SMOG check. I drive by and saw a sign for that service. I was treated with friendly respect up front. I was seen right away. It was hard to determine what is their policy and what was a favor so I won't go into details but I will say I got the best deal in town (I did the research). Eric was fast, professional and flexible. I was out the door in under 20 minutes. Excellent service. Recommended!<//Review></record>

Very easy to get the smog test with state certification, & at a great price too with their online coupon on their website! It was quick & efficient for the test, and didn’t take very long. Thank you!</text>

I chose this location just because it is close to my home. But they really provide good service. They are really friendly, easy to communicate with. Their work is fast and nice. Also the pricing is really fair.< /Text>

The team over at Arco Highland Smog Pros took care of my ‘02 Camry that had issues passing smog. They were able to mitigate the issues and get me in and out in no time at all. The team wore masks the whole time as a Covid precaution, even when they were inside my car. It’s safe to say I’ll be returning to Highland Smog Pros for all my future smog needs. Thanks guys!</review>

So fast and friendly! Call before you go in case there is a wait bc they share the garage with an Arco and there isn’t a ton of parking. From my phone call through to the end of my service, I felt very well cared for. I’m so happy I found this place!<//Review>

Eric was able to see my car for a Smog Check literally as soon as I pulled up. The test took only ten minutes and the waiting room sold masks, sanitizer and disposable gloves, especially important in the current times!
Wonderful customer service, I’ll definitely be back the next time I need a Smog Check!<//Review>

This place was fast, efficient and courteous.  I was in and out in under 15 minutes.  The cost for the inspection was exactly what was advertised.  I was then able to get the certification I needed for my car registration.  The gentleman who helped me was friendly and answered my questions.  Just as I was finished, another customer came so this place is popular and for good reason.  I would recommend this place and would definitely come again.</review>

<review>I called to see if they had any clients, said they were finishing up one, and took me right away when I got there. Prices and fees were dictated straight up and service was very quick. Staff were friendly.</review><Name>Rina Gutierrez</Name>< Rating>

Those additional fees get you, but that's not the vendor, and he went above and beyond to explain it all. He was so kind and honest, made sure I got all the discounts he could possibly provide. He even gave me a popsicle because it was a hot day. I'd say that's pretty amazing service for something that is genuinely kind of a hassle. Grateful for their service!< /review>

Was in and out super fast, great experience. Erik was very friendly and honored car pricing he had quoted before realizing I was in an SUV. Great local mom and pop shop for a fast smog test.</text>

Pulled the coupon, called in, drove to location and the coupon is not honored. Was told a complete different story, that the coupon is for inspection only, WHAT? Quoted $69 and change, then quoted $49. Discount after based on how I pay, preferred cash. Bait and switch. No Thank YOU!<//Text>

Had just a few minutes to get a smog check done. Found this place on Google, walked in without an appointment and got anazing customer service! Needed a minor repair that would have caused a failed test. Instead of failing me and making me pay, the repair was done for a reasonable price and I was able to pass smog. Saved me a TON of time and money. Good customer service is hard to find. Highly recommend this place!<//review>

Outrageous. I called and told them I’d be by before 4pm to get my smog checked. Yes I get it’s Sunday but some of us work during regular business hours and only can come at weird hours on the weekends.

I wouldn’t have driven here if this was this case. Gonna call star smog certified to tell them of this terrible business</text>< Pics>

Had a great experience with Eric. I had my battery recently replaced and had to come back again and again before my car was ready for a smog inspection. Each time, Eric was gracious and efficient. Couldn't recommend coming here higher.</review>

Outrageous. I called and told them I’d be by before 4pm to get my smog checked. Yes I get it’s Sunday but some of us work during regular business hours and only can come at weird hours on the weekends.

I wouldn’t have driven here if this was this case. Gonna call star smog certified to tell them of this terrible business< /text>< Pictures>

<name>Victor Chan< /name><Time>1528404944392</Time><rate>1< /rate><review>Did smog about a year ago and still annoyed about it. The price changed from online price but I agreed. Then I was told it will be more because my 1997 C class was too complicated and they needed to take things apart to get to the spark plug wires. I agreed because I just wanted it done. Costed about $60or 70 but that is not the biggest issue. They took off the intake just to reach the cover on top of the spark plugs and cut a zip tie in the process even though the zip tie doesn't need to be cut at all. I was there the whole time and they wouldn't let me near the car. When they were done, I drove home and the car wasn't running properly. They didn't install the interested back properly and there was a massive air leak after the MAF sensor. I wouldn't trust them to ever touch my car again. Doesn't even have common sense for simple things in the car and that kind of stuff is required class to get smog license. The worst thing for new was they didn't even have the courtesy to let me know that they couldn't put the intake back on properly. I would have been fine if they just let me know about that even after all the other problems.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>The place is a scam. Online they claim their price is $24.95. My wife walked in, the cashier said it'd be $70+ but he would knock it down to just over $50 if she gave a yelp review. He wouldn't budge despite the coupon and online advertised price. Don't go unless you are up for an argument.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Wow!! What a wonderful experience.  I had a flat tire.  Friday, in the afternoon I contacted Big Brand.  They set an appointment within an hours time.  I drive in and they took care of everything.  They have Covid protections in place.. They are courteous and professional.  No wonder their Store was so busy.  Most of all they did not pressure me to buy anything, and charged me nothing.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1614093153162, 'text': 'We are always striving to offer excellent tire and automotive services.

I have been going to BigBrand for several years now. They attracted me as a customer with free flat repairs, free tire rotations, and low price guarantee.

The problem with free rotations and flat repairs is the wait, always 1 hour minimum for a 5 minute job. Obviously they want to sell you new tires every time you come in for a free service. I bought 4 kumos (70k mile warranty) for my Acura at their shop and after 30k miles I went in for another rotation and they wouldn't rotate and said I need new tires. I wasn't offered any warranty assistance.

Last month I needed tires for my Mazda and asked them to price match tire buyer dot com on a set of Firestone Firehawk Indy 500. They couldn't beat the price and would only get within  about $40 of it. I wasn't offered a free set of tires like they advertise as you can see in my attached photo.

Today I went in for an oil change I had an appointment at 9AM. My first red flag went up when he asked if I was going to wait for it, of course it's an oil change takes me 20 minutes to do myself.  I asked if it was going to be a while and was told it would be done within the hour. Well at 936AM my car finally moves into the shop. Next red flag goes up when I watch the lube tech look under the hood for a few minutes with confusion.  I go out there and ask him if he is looking for tor filter location and he said yes. I told him it is under the car near the drain plug.  At 1015AM I am told by the salesperson that they cannot get the old oil filter off.  I asked if they can have a more experienced person try, so he said he would get "The Mechanic" to try. They have 10 people working on cars out there but only one is a mechanic? The mechanic gets the filter off in under 30 seconds and returns to his work.  They spend 30 more minutes refilling the oil, replacing filter,  and resetting the oil monitor. At 1045AM the job is done. Almost 2 hours for an oil change AND I had an appointment!

I would recommend you only take your vehicle here if you can drop it off for a day or two and not care how long it takes them.  There are a few other places in town that offer the same free rotations, flat repairs, and low price guarantees. I might be going to a different store from now on.<//Review>

<userid>101528907905521951919< /userid><Text>Scheduled tires and an alignment 4 days ahead of time. I show up for my appointment and I'm told my car can't be aligned (Tesla M3) Service advisor said that I called in to the call center and there's no way for them to know what they can and can't do at the store. I called the local number, and spoke to whoever answered. It's not my problem to ask who it is and where. My options were to get tires now and alignment at a later date. I'm not putting new tires on a car that I know needs alignment. Really disappointed! Needless to say you lost my business to a competitor.< /Text><rate>1<//rate>< Date>

<Text>These guys are great!  I stopped in Santa Maria just for gas and realized I had a huge nail piercing thru my tire. (Hense the tire pressure light on my dash that had BEEN on which I ignored....I know I know)

I had 2 stay the night and walked 3 blocks to Big Brand Tires.  The manager Carlos went way out of his way and had one of his employees drive me back to my car to get my flat tire.  I couldn't drive my car there  it was THAT bad.

Back at the shop he changed my tire right away, drove me back to my car, put it on and I was on my way.  Pretty sure they let me jump a few spots in line too.

Its companies like this that go out of their way to extend that extra help that turns a one time sale into a future lifetime customer.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>The guys at Big Brand Tires are great!  Very pleasant and professional every time I bring my cars in for tires or service.  In my experience, they've always been good to their word with fixing, repairing, and having my car ready when they say it will be ready.  They communicate well by calling you if there are any changes to their estimates.  Nothing unexpected here and I really appreciate that!  Also, they are very good with Covid, spacing out customers and wearing masks.  Feels safe in there!  I'd recommend Big Brand Tires without hesitation!

< Review>
What's the point of scheduling an appointment weeks in advance, if they are going to take so long to help you. then you drop off your car early in the morning and never hear the status on when your car will be ready for a simple routine service. Then after your 3rd or 4th time trying to get a hold of them they keep saying it's almost ready and when you call right before the shop closes they say it's just been sitting in the parking lot for hours.</Review>

Big Brand in Santa Maria did an outstanding job installing my new tires (2). I had made an appointment for Saturday morning and I was late. They didn't even blink, took my car in, were professional, and still had me out in under an hour. Also, I got a great price on my tires! Great job, Big Brand!</Review>

From standing in line 6 feet apart, approaching the counter with a table between the technician and customers, to receiving the estimate via mobile and even paying with my phone, the experience was great. And as usual, we got a great service and pricing. We'll keep using Big Brands in the future!</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I had a bad experience with BB in Arroyo grande. However BB Santa Maria is probably my top pick. They have great technicians and give great quality. I am very picky and needed an alignment and tire balancing, they left everything perfect. My guys to go to are Don and Alfie. They are the best.<//Review>

Pricey but they take care of your needs. Find the neighborhood guy who will give you more for your money. Said they rotated the tires but no they didn't. I'll just have to make sure they rotate next time and check tire pressure.< /Review>

<review>Alex at the Santa Maria store was exceptional. Courteous, professional and easy to work with. I went in to buy 4 new tires for my Lexus 470. He gave me a great price on Michelins and was so impressed with him that I brought my sons car in and out 4 new tires and a wheel alignment. Alexis definitely trained well and an awesome asset to Big Brand. I won’t go anywhere else. In fact it’s time for my free tire rotation! Check them out- Robert from Santa Maria.</review>< Rate>

Made an appointment for tires and brakes. The guys got me checked in fast and let me know if would be about 3 hours.
Almost 3 hours on the dot they let me know my car was ready and the brakes had plenty of life left. I really appreciate Alexandro’s honesty and how personable he was during our transaction. The bill was exactly what I expected too which was nice.
Keep up the great work!</Text>

The store answered the phone immediately,  and confirmed that they have the exact tires i needed..
They fit me in just 3 hours later, and had me down the road 2 hours later.
I was 2800 miles from home, and they helped me with a major problem that eased my mind.
I am grateful for such wonderful service.< /text>

<Text>The reason for 4 starts instead of 5 is because my first time wasn’t that great. It honestly depends on who you ask to do the job. Therefore, if you ask for the right person then you should get a 10/10. I went to the Santa Maria BB and the two techs I highly recommend are an older guy, Don, and another guy named Alfy.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Carlos and his team at Big Brand Tire are an exception to the rule.  I arrived for my 9am appointment at 8:55 and was on the rack within 5 minutes.  They got my Corvette aligned and tracking the road like new.  However, I wasn't the only satisfied customer.  I listened as person after person remarked how great the service was.  I heard him describe the services others had received and each time they had exceeded the customers expectations by ensuring every "i" was dotted and every "t" crossed! I will refer everyone I know to this location as they epitomize customer service!!</Review>

Antonio is exceptionally skilled and generous with getting the lowest estimates possible and making sure the service is fast and efficiant, ultimately he wants you to get the best deal possible and leave driving on the road safe, and that's why I drive from out of town just to get my car serviced by Antonio and his crew!!

The guys outside were fast to get our tire down from our truck, sent us inside to handle paperwork. The young man inside said we can drop our tire off and to give them an hour and half to fix it.  It's parent teacher conferences and we have a pre-k that gets out in the afternoon. So be able to get in and out so fast was awesome!!</review>< Response>

Today I had a great experience at big Brand tire Santa Maria I've taken my truck to several different tire and alignment shops but it never was quite right I explained the issues I was having to Antonio and he knew exactly what was going on he passed the information on to his technicians and now it drives like a brand new truck look forward to doing business with them in the future!!<//review>

<text>I had some service done to my car and I was told I needed to get front tires as soon as possible. That's the last thing I wanted to do since I just bought a set 2 years ago :(  I asked around and everybody kept telling me "go to Big Brand Tire, they are awesome! Best price in town!"  So, I checked them out.

I was very pleased with the personal service I received from Carlos and he gave me such a good deal that I ended up getting all four new tires instead of the two I had planned.  He even recommended a different tire than the ones I had ordered because of his personal experience with them and the fact that it would save me quite a bit of money.

I am very happy with the new tires!!  They ride really well and have very good traction!  I would not hesitate to go to Big Brand Tire again and I would highly recommend!!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Don't lie to customers just to make some money!
My family and I been a customers with you guys for about 10 years now but you guys lost us now how is it possible that I just bought a 2019 car less than a week ago and had a flat tire and you guy were trying to make me purchase a brand new tire when my car only had a 100 miles in it.
PS- I was able to get it fix somewhere else.</text>

It's fine to try and make sales, but not to lie to people. Like others on here, I was immediately told I needed new tires even though I just got some about a month ago and I was offered the most expensive ones with no other options until I said no. I don't mind being sold to, but being lied to isn't fun. Just be prepared when you go in, don't listen to the nonsense. I heard him saying the same thing to other customers when I went back to pick up my car. Thanks, Antonio.</review>

We buy all our tires here. Appreciate the free flat repairs. Service is adequate, about what you would expect from a tire shop.  I don't comparison shop, but prices seem to be really good and I like to be loyal to businesses that treat me fairly.< /review>

I had the dealership look at it, and it was stable and not damaged like you said. You wanted $300 from me? I hope this review costs you at least $30,000 in customers.

Call ahead 30 minutes before the appointment to see if they are behind and how long the wait will be. They say an hour. Go to the appointment and an hour later notice that my car hasn't been touched. Literally sitting where it was parked. What??When what was going on and they stated that someone went to lunch during my appointment slot and no one touched my car yet. To make matters worse, once they started working on my car, they realized that they didn't have a key part needed to complete the work. The wait was ridiculous and the workers obviously don't know anything about basic communication.  Now I just hope I won't find something wrong with my car because they forgot something or messed something up with their ineptitude. Seriously, take your car somewhere else.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
I went here when I needed new tires last year after moving to SM.  I have gone here since.  I went to Jiffy Lube one time due to time and would regret it that same weekend after they put a part in wrong and my car lost all of its oil during a road trip.  This solidified my decision to use Big Brand Tires and I only go there now for my car.  A couple days ago my tire light came on and today (a Sunday) I found a screw in it.  I immediately drove to Big Brand and they were able to get my tire fixed and checked all the others for free.  Tyler and the crew gave me peace of mind and were able to help with only a couple hours til closing.  I was so grateful!</Review>

After I had already paid and was told my car was ready, I walked out to see that my car was still on the spare tire and that they chose to put the new tires on whatever rim they wanted. After speaking with(store manager) Carlos and getting no explanation why they chose to ignore all my instructions, I had to leave and drive home 25 miles on the spare tire because it was closing time.<//Review><Time>1563422811975<//Time>< Response>

<name>Leo A< /name><date>1528561443286</date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Where to begin. I recommended that my 72 year old mother go to Big Brand as I've used the Ventura location for years. She was in desperate need of rear brakes on her Honda. 1st quote she received (upon inspection) was very fair. Then when we picked up her car the final amount went up by 40 dollars. I do understand things are discovered when the job starts sometimes but they could and would not give a breakdown of where that 40 dollars was coming from. A little shady I believe.

Then, the next day I was back in Santa Maria and observed what looked like soda spilled all over the passenger side of the paint and inside the car. My mother keeps her car in showroom condition so it was extremely noticeable. When we called and spoke to Ramiro about the issues of the spilled soda he replied with "that wasn't us. My guys would never do that but bring it by if you want and I'll wash it for you". Wrong answer Ramiro. For a Manager, i would expect more and a better attitude. We will be taking our business elsewhere next time. Shame because I was looking to purchase wheels, tires and a lift for my truck.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Today I visited Big Brand in Santa Maria to fix a flat. I was in my way to airport with my two kids when I got a screw in my tire. After getting road side assistance I made it to big brand. I let them know my situation and they asked if I had an appointment - I did not given the circumstances. He stated I could wait 2hrs and leave the vehicle with him. I asked if there was any way I could immediately get service -he again said “if you had an appointment.” This is absolutely unacceptable. I walked out and drove my car down the road while losing tire pressure to SM TIRE, where I was greeted AT MY CAR and received immediate service. In and out in 20 minutes. Back safely on the road with my kids. There is no reason to have to wait 2hrs for a 20 minute emergency service.<//review>

< review>
Made an appointment and took time off work to beat the crowd. Scheduled an oil change and tire rotation. Took 90mins before I said something. I listenef to multiple customers who were there before me complain about their wait. The manager did comp my service but I think he missed the point. I watched the tech working on my car walk around and goof off with other techs. Some were more focused than others but no one was supervising. This is the third time I have had service done at this store and it's degraded every time.

Update for Darla.
I had another horrible experience at another one of your locations. My wife made the appointment on this one not me. Different location with an appointment. This was on a Saturday so I almost blame ourselves. Dropped off 30 mins early than had to beg for our keys 2 and half hours later when we canceled the alignment. Older lady was shaking her head and complaining since she was there that long also. At least we shared in our misery with others.

Instead of asking me to help you, couldn't you make your own appointment and see for yourself? Send your friends/family? Than you send me your findings and I will take a closer look?< /review>

I informed him I did not have the time but really wanted to get them done since I commute to Santa Barbara every day. He said he could put a second technician on the job and get me out in time to make it to work. My car was done 5 minutes prior to when they said it would me !!

I have taken my cars here forever.  I have always had speedy service, great experiences with qualified professionals that are always courteous and friendly. They have never recommended anything I didn't need and even worked with me on a new set of tires when I had minimal money to spend and got me a great set of tires.  They have always taken excellent care of me, my daughter and our cars.</text>

<text>Tldr: I had to bring my car in 4 times to get an alignment done properly. But they did make a point to fix it without charging me for more than the initial alignment and tires.

I went in monday 12:30 for two tires and a 4 wheel alignment because my car turns to the left. Steve told me my remaining two tires were aged but still fine for the alignment. Upon picking up car at 4:00, was told alignment was not completed correctly because of old tires.

Came in tuesday at 4:00 to replace old tires. I now have 4 new tires. Alignment was done and Antonio told me it was good to go at 5:45. After driving i realized the car turned hard to the right.

I called in at 6:55 and Nick said the alignment would be fixed as a "rush job"

I brought it in wednesday at 4:00 to fix the alignment. It was aligned again. Tyler told me it was good to go again. After driving it i noticed it still turned to the right. Tyler and I drove the car together, and he agreed it was still turning right. At about 6:15 Tyler offered me the option of a refund or trusting them one more time to fix it.

Thursday Tyler and his Manager picked the car up from my office at 10:30, had it all day, and returned it to me by 3:30. At this point the car finally drives straight.

I appreciated that Tyler took it upon them to fix the issue. However, I don't think I should have ever been returned a car that didnt drive straight. It was obvious upon test driving that the car was not aligned, but twice I was told the car was correctly aligned and was given my keys back.<//text>< pictures>

I want to comment on the snibbling, whining customers who leave negative feedback because they had to wait although they had an appointment. Get real you whiners, these guys try there best and are only human.  Doing mechanic work is difficult at best and one can't predict the multitude of problems that may surface with even a small repair. You should lighten up and think about your last Dr. or dental appointment, were they waiting for you on arrival? I doubt it. Maybe you should just get yourself a personal mechanic to be there for you 24/7 when you break down, what an expense that would be!  I think you might get my point.

I don't usually write reviews, but my experience at the Santa Maria Big Brand Tire was negative enough that I feel it's worth sharing. I went in today for a set of new tires. After signing the paperwork I was told that they were a little behind schedule so it would be about 1.5 hours before I would get my car back. When scheduling the appointment I had seen a web page describing a "50/50 challenge" (tire change in 50 minutes or you get $50 off). So, naturally, I mentioned that I'd seen that online and I was wondering if that applied. The attendant at the desk asked me to wait for a moment while he went into the shop and, when he returned, told me they would do what they could to finish the job in under 50 minutes.

Fast forward 32 minutes later... I hear my name and walk up to the counter. They finished 18 minutes early! I was impressed, to say the least.  However, that's when my mood changed. When I got to the counter a worker from the shop (who I assumed was the manager, but didn't confirm) poked his head in to ask if they beat the 50/50 challenge. When it's confirmed that they did he made a point of loudly saying (i'm paraphrasing) "Of course, because we pushed back everyone else" so that everyone in the waiting room could hear, making me look like a jerk. I was then informed by the attendant that the 50/50 usually needs to be requested when the online appointment is made, that way they can plan accordingly.

As a customer, it isn't my job to know the ins and outs of Big Brand Tire's policies. I'm an easy going guy. If they had told me when I arrived that I needed to mention the 50/50 challenge when I booked the appointment, oh well, I would've been sure to do it the next time. Unfortunately for them, there wont be a next time. The way the manager(?) rudely announced to everyone that I was making them late was unprofessional and immature. I had just spent over $500 at their business and I was immediately put down because THEY had not informed me about THEIR business policies when I had first arrived.

Normally I would give them 1 star, but I'm giving them 2 because they did finish the job early and the attendant I spent most of the time speaking to was calm, collected, and courteous (unlike the other guy!). I'll let them have the second star for that because they won't be getting my business again.

**Note to anyone that still decides to go here: Make sure you call them when making an appointment and mention the 50/50 challenge! That way you won't get stuck with a long wait time like some of the other commenters (or at least you'll get $50 off your purchase!)**<//review>

I am sure it was a headache for them, but they stuck with it until the problem was solved and did so with no expense to me.  I will definitely be returning to their store in the future.</Review>< username>

<text>I've been there three times so far. Twice for a wheel alignment and once for a total inspection.  When others could not tell me what was wrong with my truck they put it up on the machine and notified me that my rear axel was bent.  Had a feeling cause I had been in an accident but two other mechanics said they couldn't find anything wrong.  The were honest upfront about the cost and and labor.  I called the dealer just to make sure the part was within range of what they said the part cost and it was.  Gone during my lunch hour all three times and they were considerate of the time frame.  Friendly and professional.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I could have done it in less than 2 hours! I've seen you guys do it in less than 10 minutes in the parking lot with 3 jacks and an air gun! Generally I like your service and your prices, but if I make an appointment and you say it will take "about" an hour... Let me tell you, 2 hours is NOT about an hour! Tell me to drop it off, that you're really busy, that you're short-staffed... or say, this is going to take 2 or more hours and you might want to get a ride AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE instead of waiting here for no reason because we don't value you making an appointment or your time! I get it, you guys get busy and it's Black Friday! Then don't take appointments and say first come first served! I'll gladly drop off the car for the day, get a ride home and use my other vehicle to takr care of my personal or professional business snd come back 4 or 5 hours later. But an hour? Arranging a ride from your store and getting a ride back to your store and getting to and from my home... that takes close to an hour. "An hour," is a reasonable time to wait. This is ridiculous, however.<//Text><name>Bill Inguito Jr.</name>< userid>

I want to advise people: DO NOT USE BIG BRAND TIRES in Santa Maria. My last set of tires were the wrong speed rating for my car, which explains why they spun out all the time over the course of the last 65K miles. Recently they recommended brake work that didn't need to be done. Thank goodness I got a second opinion. The female employee there is the worst. I was told they work on commission and trust me, she knows how to up sell you with a straight face. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the people are nice (although sheisty) and the work is quick.< /text>

If your time is valuable you might want to try some other place.  A one hour appointment turned into a three and a half hour ordeal because they forgot to order the part they were supposed to put in.  If you schedule work with them that needs something to be ordered, call them a few days before your appointment to make sure the part came in.<//Text>

<Review>Very upset about big brand tires.i only went in here because I was offered a coupon for 25$ for an oil change. I called before I purchased and asked for a quote on my car they quoted me $40.22 plus the coupon for a VW  JETTA 2014 .  I bought the coupon Made an appointment and then I went in for my appointment. First as it turnes out I now had to pay 60 because the tech didn't check my car needs 7 quarts of oil. Next my appointment was at 4 and my car didn't go into service until an hour and a half later. (Just to get my car in, plus the time it takes for the oil change)So the wait is ridiculous considering I made an appointment. After that my car starts marking my tires are LOW which they filled . I went back they filled them up. But no customer service skills what's so every or apologizing for doing it incorrectly the first time! . And now the big one takes a winner!!!!!! My car is now marking in WORDS  "inspection" . I just called and spoke to a manager. He said they will check it out I hope they fix it with out messing something else!!! Very upset with this place WILL NOT ever come back

Will update once they check why it's marking inspection!< /Review><time>1501092510725</time><Name>Nadia Uriostegui<//Name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I have been a long term customer of Big Brand Tire in Santa Maria and have made them my number one choice for years dealing with Mike the manager over there. They have done large and small work for me and I never minded paying the price because of the quality of work. Today I spent over an hour of my day standing in line to drop off and pick up my car. I called in advance to drop my car off and make sure it would be and asked to pick it up at 330pm for an oil change. Not only on both occasions did the workers without Mike there not show any care or urgency to get the job done, but the desk guy literally went and stood outside for 15 minutes to bs with mechanics while the line piled up. The only reason I'm leaving two stars and not one star is Mike he has been hands down the best, but if he isn't working to waste people's time is terrible. Drove down the road to Santa Maria Wash and Lube and was having my car serviced in 15 minutes. Disappointed in Big Brand to say the least.</Review>

< Review>
I went here to get my tire repaired because I had run over a piece of a screw. The staff was very friendly and the shop was clean so I felt good about it. They told me that they couldn't repair it and that I'd have to buy a new tire. A new matching tire was going to cost $204 and they had 2 other options. We decided to go with the matching one, but it had to be ordered. I ordered it on a Thursday. The service member told me that it would be in on Monday, so I decided to wait it out. He said he'd call on Monday when it arrived. Monday is here and I didn't receive a call so I decided to call to check in. The man I spoke with told me that I was given misinformation and that the tire wouldn't be in until Tuesday or Wednesday. I am a mother of four with a very busy schedule so not only was it going to be completely unsafe, but also inconvenient. They said they were sorry. I went somewhere else. The other place repaired the tire (which according to BIG BRAND was un-repairable) at no cost to me and were very friendly. BIG BRAND missed the mark. I won't be going back.<//Review>

<text>Set an appointment at this store to have my brakes replaced and to have a screw removed from my tire. They told me that it would take about 2 hours to fix everything. After waiting 3 hours I went back to the store to see if my truck was finished and I found out they hadn’t even touched it yet. When I went up to the desk they told me that appointments don’t really mean anything and that it would be at least another 2 hours before my truck was finished. They really don’t care about their customers time.< /text>< rate>

Service time is awful. You make an appointment and 2 hours later still waiting for a tire change and headlight bulb change. Came Monday waited same time. Had to come back because I had to go to work. Today same thing. Why schedule appointment? Then you have to ask how much longer. They won't even tell you.<//Review>

I took my car for a tire rotation. They said my front strut was leaking. I took my car home and noticed the stearing was off and my wheel squeeked. After inspecting my car myself, I realized that they never tighten the lugnuts on my front driver side wheel.< /Text>

<Review>Super amazing service! Rico and Hector are so helpful omg! They help disassemble all my furniture and carefully wrap them with extra waterproof layers. MakeSpace also mailed me bags ahead to help me pack. I also just love their mobile app, so sleek! and all the stored items are tracked. I used to think moving/storing furniture is such a headache, but this is so simple!! Love it< /Review>< Pictures>

Taking the best care of our customers' items is always our top priority, and it's disappointing to hear that your experience hasn't fully reflected this distinction.\n\nI see that you're working with a supervisor on our Customer Support team to file a claim for reimbursement, and I want to assure you that we're committed to resolving all pending issues as expeditiously as possible.\n\nTake care,\nThe MakeSpace Team"}<//Response>
<text>Junk storage service. They damaged my $3500 leather couch by not wrapping it properly. I told the pickup team to wrap it properly to avoid damaging it. But the pickup person told me not to worry and that they will make sure not to damage the couch. When they delivered my couch it was exactly in the same state - not wrapped properly with one end of it exposed and damaged due to shoddy wrapping and damaged during transit and storage.

When I opened a claim for my damages, they offered 60 cents per pound.

Store only things that are worth 60 cents per pound at this junk storage place.

They also lost my bed frame. And had no record of it.

SHAME ON MAKESPACE. SHAME ON RAHUL

Every review on Google is fake! Look at yelp for a more accurate picture of the quality of this junk service.

Yovanny, Cristian, and Andy were great. They kept me up to date on their ETA, took good care of my stuff as they packed it, and took apart my furniture at my request so it would take up less space. I had my own mattress cover so they didn’t charge me for that service but they still helped me the cover on (which I wasn’t able to do alone). I had around a studio apartment sized amount of stuff and they were in an out in less than an hour and a half. Really nice guys, thanks again!</review>

<Review>Andy and Demarco are the best movers I have ever had. They were super polite and efficient, helpful in answering any questions we had about packing items, and very informative about the process and next steps. They showed up exactly on time and provided any additional materials we needed to secure items and close up boxes. Highly recommended!!< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

I had such an amazing experience with MakeSpace. The movers in particular made it such a pleasant experience. I had Abdullah, Fernando and Cristian spearheading the effort. What an amazing team. They were friendly, swift, and very respectful of my belongings. They took extra care with delicate items like artwork and mirrors etc. and I felt complete trust in them. I would recommend this team to anyone moving in SF – I wouldn't want anyone else on the job!< /Review>

It was incredible! I loved their services.
Juan and Jesus sent me a message in advance informing that they would be here in 30 minutes, they called me when they arrive and they were so fast and respectful! My suitcases and boxes were taken with care and respect.
Would I hire them again? Of course! Amazing and the best service!
Thank you make space and special thank you to Jesus and Juan!< /review>

Holy costumer care and support! Moving is stressful and MakeSpace makes the process super easy. No moving fees, 48 hours to cancel (in case your moving date changes), great customer support and super nice movers who don’t waste time.
I had to move my move date a few times and it was so easy to do with the app and reminders that were sent. The customer service team always check back with me while I was figuring out the logistics of my move. Christian, Roberto, and Rico were the most kind and professional movers. I had even locked myself out (did I mention moving was stressful?) and they were patient and helpful with me getting into my apartment. After my items were moved my storage quote had changed and I contacted CS again and they made an adjustment for me.
The process is so seamless and easy with Make Space. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for storage or to move.< /review>

MakeSpace is so convenient and the entire process was so easy! My movers were Josh, Jose, and Tim who were so friendly. The warehouse forgot to include one piece of furniture with my delivery, but Josh helped solve it and got me another delivery appointment free of charge!

Excellent service. I can highly recommend MakeSpace. The guys who picked up
my things, Fernando, Juan de Leon and Maynor, were very professional and efficient. They arrived early and were very careful with my things as they loaded them into the truck. Making arrangements with MakeSpace was  very easy and their price plan is reasonable. Best moving/storage experience I have ever had<//text>

<text>This is my 2nd pick-up from MakeSpace.  Abdullah and Eric were great.  Friendly and very professional.   I can't recommend them enough!

My first pick-up with MakeSpace was a different experience.   A large mirror (before and after photos attached) was left outside by the MakeSpace Team for an extended period of time and the San Francisco wind knocked it over.   Broke into lots of little pieces that required quite a bit of time for me to clean up.

The support team at MakeSpace seems very nice but everything is done via email (there is no way to upload photos to your account or submit a support ticket for broken items thru your account).  Would be very helpful if all of this could be done in the MakeSpace portal instead of lots of emails going back forth.< /text><GmapID>0x808f796d4e3b209d:0x610ddc9035cb9018<//GmapID>< Time>

MakeSpace is an excellent service that provides diligent and efficient work. Fernando and Maynor were huge in making my move today as quick and painless as possible! They were really nice and took great care of my stuff. I can’t think of much to complain about... as difficult as moves can be most of the time, it is a pretty convenient and reliable service!! Will update when I receive my stuff back at a new place in a few months.<//text>

Anyone who gets this dynamic duo is lucky, and they will do an awesome job helping with your storage solution.

Best moving experience by far! I would like to thank Eric Chan & Fernando for being super careful and professional during the whole moving process. They handle our fragile items with extra cautious. I was worry about the lack of space given the amount of items I have. And Eric gave me useful advice and practical solutions. Also Fernando took the extra step to dissemble some of my furnitures without me asking to. PRO work! Many thanks! !
I would definitely use MakeSpace as my default moving option in the future and recommend it to friends.<//text>

Eric, Rico and Abdul were excellent. They arrived right on time and got to work immediately. We had a ton of stuff and they were proactive about calling in additional help right away to assist with some of the larger items. We also were getting ready for a long-haul move directly out of storage and they were very helpful in ensuring our fragile and valuable items were wrapped up and secured extra well. Would definitely use them again.</text>

<Review>Today I tried out this new company because I wanted to store some furniture. I just expected that they would load it into the truck and store it but Fernando and Demarco came, wrapped up everything with moving blankets and plastic wrap and then took photos so I could see it later. Literally as soon as they let, the items showed up on my website account. They had to move furniture that was up two flights of stairs and did it really well. I highly recommend this service. I'm glad that someone is finally disrupting the expensive traditional model of storage :)<//Review>< username>

Amazing, seamless moving experience with fantastic customer service. Juan C. and Lewis were kind and efficient when moving our belongings into our new space. I used Makespace to move out, to store for 6+ months, and to move in, and the people + website has been a 10/10 experience. Even though an item was accidentally damaged during the process, the Makespace customer support team has had our back and helped us resolve the claim with no headache at all. Honestly, this is the only company I'm going to turn to in the future and the only one I'd recommend so strongly.<//text>

Rico, Cesar and Juan did a fantastic job in moving all my stuff hassle free especially in a complex townhome structure. Love the service.

I just had more stuff to drop off and used the self service option. Josh and Chris were amazing. Josh was standing in the rain waiting for me to arrive sharp at 8 am and ensured I find the place without any hassle.<//text>

<Time>1620833750579< /Time><Text>Beware. Movers will come, give terrible attitude about having to pick up items, if an item is too heavy they'll just leave it behind, and when you want to have your items moved back in, there's all this fine print around how you can move it, cost of moving it, and so forth. For instance, if you want to pick your items up yourself with a uhaul, they won't help you load the items onto your truck. There are cheaper, easier options out there for both moving and storage.<//Text>< username>

<Review>Very quick, hassle-free moving and storage, seriously, try it! Special shout-out to Yovanny Louis and Christopher for making this very easy and seamless. They were very careful about COVID related guidelines, did most of the inventory work outdoors and explained the whole process very clearly. I still cannot completely believe how easy and fast moving my 1 BR apartment worth of stuff was. Thank you people and happy holidays.</Review>< pics>

Great experience with the pickup process from MakeSpace. Joseph N, Ryan and Josh showed up on time and were super quick and efficient loading my stuff. They even had extra tape and helped wrap up a few remaining items. Very happy with my experience with MakeSpace so far. Highly recommend!< /Review>

Joseph, Cesar, and Louis made moving out of my apartment such a breeze. They arrived right on time, we’re super efficient and professional with moving everything out, and even helped me recover an item that got packed by accident. My experience with MakeSpace has been great so far, and I’d recommend the service.<//review>

<text>Ryan, Angel and Rob were awesome. They carefully and efficiently moved us out of our 2 bedroom with huge attention to detail. We really enjoyed our move out experience and would definitely recommend these guys! I would note to make sure you’re aware of the number of items including boxes you’re moving to make sure you’re not surprised with the unit size you need at the end.< /text>< Date>

Making the request was super simple as well. My only complaint is that my bags for packing up my stuff never arrived. I had to go buy my boxes last minute so I could pack ahead of time.

Bhavjeet and Daniel were my movers and helped pack up all my stuff. They were awesome. I would have only given 4 stars because of the issue with my bags but these guys did such a good job I decided to bump it up. They were quick and professional. They went the extra mile to make sure my stuff was safe and secure while packing.

Would highly recommend.</text><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x808f796d4e3b209d:0x610ddc9035cb9018< /gmapID>< time>

Really Bad. Nice delivery personnel but super super slow customer feedback.

I got a delivery two weeks ago with 3 items missing. They just can't find the items in their warehouse for over 2 weeks.

Even though they said I can file claims about the missing items, it took them FOREVER to reply back or even reimburse me for my loss.

If you have valuable furniture, definitely NOT choose this service.<//Review>

<Text>Best moving experience ever. Signing up and communication from makespace leading up to the moving day was clear and helpful. Having bags ahead of time to pack was convenient and made the moving day easier. The stickers and labels for the moving bags made organization easy! Having an arrival window is normal for the industry, but makespace even sent me a text with an ETA they day of when they left their previous job, with a 30-40minute ETA depending on traffic. Once the team was here, Eric, Jesus and Ricardo did an absolutely fantastic job moving everything out speedily without sacrificing quality. They did a better job packing and safeguarding our furniture than we could have imagined! Very kind, answered our questions, and handled everything. All this and it was the cheapest option too!  This made moving such a breeze, I look forward to using makespace again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< username>

<review>Had a great experience with the moving team & customer service. Called about a week before I need to store stuff as an emergency, fit me into their schedule, and the moving team was able to take all my items plus a few more unexpected that I needed. The moving team (Jesus, Angel, and Juan) were great and easy to work with. Highly recommend.<//review>< Response>

<text>I'm so happy I picked MakeSpace among the other moving and storage solutions. Shoutout to Fernando and Joseph N. who made our move seamless (we were moving out of a 3-story walkup apartment). They kept me updated with their arrival times, and I didn't have to lift a finger because they took care of everything.

A few weeks ago when I was making a reservation, I was in between two storage unit sizes and decided to rent the larger of the two options to be safe. Customer Service assured me that if my belongings fit into a small unit, they would bill me for the smaller space, and sure enough my invoice was cheaper than I anticipated!<//text><user_name>Melissa Pangilinan<//user_name><Rate>5</Rate>< Time>

I couldn’t recommend Makespace more. The movers - Joseph, Cesar, and Jesus - were fantastic. My packers hadn’t done the best job and they went out of their way to ensure my things were as safe as possible going into storage. East communication before the movers and very east interface. Five stars!< /review>

DeMarco Daniel and Josh were very helpful with my move. I was very stressed about moving out of my place under a time constraint and they not only made me comfortable and confident that my stuff was cared for properly but also made the moving experience lovely and full of laughter.
Seamless!

Josh, Eric, and Juan were an excellent team of movers! They took care of everything, took time to disassemble my vanity, and wrapped everything out of precaution. They were friendly, polite and quick. I will surely be recommending this service to friends in the Bay Area. Thank you!<//review>

Was provided great service from the MakeSpace teams, from pickup to delivery everyone was so respectful and friendly to speak with. I stored my items for about half a year and was so glad to see them mostly unharmed (my bad for putting easily bendable items that can’t fit in a box in storage!)

Special thanks to Bhavjeet & Fernando for getting my stuff up a windy, small mountain and having to deal with oncoming traffic.<//Review>

<Review>I had Joseph,Cesar, and Jonathan who Helped me out on Thursday to move the entire stuffs from my room and they were just amazing. They texted me 30-40 mins before arrival, and professionally moved everything out within an hour. I was a bit stressed with the whole idea about moving, but they just made it so simple and easy. I had 17 bins, 2 wardrobe boxes, a queen size mattress, and a bed frame, etc. and they carried positive attitude throughout the whole time and well explained all of my questions. I really appreciate their service and I hope they will be assigned again when I move my stuffs out of storage and deliver to the new address. Thanks a lot guys!!<//Review>< pictures>

I put my stuff into storage with MakeSpace. They sent a team of 3 people who worked relentlessly to move my 2 bedroom’s worth of furniture! The process was easy and I would definitely use them again.

Shout out to Cristian, Timothy, and Joseph N for all the help! They were prompt, dealt with my building’s regulations, and went the extra mile to store some odd shaped items!</review>

I'm moving from SF to Mexico indefinitely and needed a way to 1. transport my stuff 2. keep my stuff safe and 3. allow me to extend on an ongoing basis. I don't know when I'm coming back to the U.S. (hopefully never) but I do know that booking this was as easy as it should be. Now I'm not stressed about moving. My representative was super nice and had great chat.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>117043074217585054346</user_id>< Rating>

< Review>
I had a great experience with MakeSpace. Abdullah, Demarco and Jose were kind, prompt and communicative. They were so quick to get my things out of my apartment. I was a little nervous since I have a lot of fragile artwork but they handled it with care and put it all in a TV box so it would be even safer. Moving and storing things is so stressful and I would definitely recommend MakeSpace for your storage needs! Setting up my appointment online was easy and straightforward.<//Review>

I tried to move out by myself - and ended up falling down the stairs and breaking my foot! If only I knew how AMAZING MakeSpace was, I definitely would not be wearing a boot right now.

Since I was unable to do basically anything, the MakeSpace team came to the rescue. They arrived right on time, quickly packed everything up, and even went above and beyond by helping me pack since I physically wasn't able to.

I was super lucky to get the dream team - Rico, Armando, and Eric. All three were super helpful, empathetic, and did a fantastic job communicating my different options with me. They took a super stressful situation and made it, dare I say, fun? Thanks again, MakeSpace!<//text>

UPDATE: Abdullah, Fernando, Louis, and Roberto and Angel were great! Drop off was just as smooth as pick up. Having done both sides now, I cannot recommend this service enough!

Jonathan, Rob, and Joe just finished our move and it couldn’t have gone smoother! They were great communicators throughout the process and did a fantastic job with everything. Honestly, probably the easiest move I’ve ever done :)< /Review>

<Text>DO NOT USE! STOLEN ITEMS!!! I have moved every year for the past 12 years. I have used MakeSpace in the past. Will never use them again.

They did a fine job picking up my items. However, when I requested they drop off ALL my items (approximately 25). I was informed by the movers, who were 2 hours late to the appointment, (I had an 8-11 slot, they showed up at 1) they only had 10 of the 25 items I requested. One of my items came open, I did not give it to them in that state. Items were broken in my boxes and one of the movers came in without a mask.

I was also told by the movers this happened to 3 of their other customers that day...

Knowing I still needed ALL my items back I booked another appointment and called several times to try and have my items delivered earlier. It's the day of my appointment and I get a call notifying me they cannot deliver my items again.

I am under the impression they've stolen my items at this time. Ita very difficult to deliver items you don't have.

Please please please use any other service besides this one. They are a waste of money and time.

Yovanny and Fernando came to my apartment exactly at 8am for a 8-11am window, were super quick moving my stuff, and were polite and professional. I was very impressed and would definitely recommend to others!</review>

My experience with Jon and Cheryl was very pleasant. They were on time, Adhered to social distancing policies, quickly answered all of my questions and treated all of my items with care. They were both kind and exceptionally professional. These two exemplify what quality service should be.< /text>

<text>Abdullah and Christian did a great job delivering my storage items by communicating & arriving within their promised time windows and going above & beyond in putting everything where I needed to get my home settled. I've been so impressed with MakeStorage's operations. It was so easy to have my items picked up, itemized, and delivered. The price was totally reasonable, and the digital interface made accessing my items feel tangible. A huge 5-star review from me.<//text>< Pictures>

Makespace is very helpful, organized, and efficient from the first inquiry, to booking, to moving, to storage.
Natasha was incredibly helpful setting up.
My movers Joseph, Juan, Angel, Fernando, Christopher, Yovanny, and Louis were all hard working and efficient.</Text>

I have told so many of my friends about this company they are most likely tired of hearing about it lol I can't speak highly enough of them.

They work so quick and were super, super nice about everything.  I love the fact that they photograph everything they store for you. I wish I would of known how they photographed things because I would of organized my stuff better and wrote on the boxes what everything is. Thats my one word of advice so you can really take advantage of this part of the service.

Josh and Fernando delivered a few things for me and it was so so smooth. You select from the photos what you would like returned and they verify it a few times.

you cant beat the price of their service and everything thats included in it.</Text>

<Text>Edited to add:
upon unwrapping my items I actually had a lot of issues.
three of the corners of my white dresser had damage, and the bag of screws to my bed frame/headboard, sides (WHICH THEY PUT IN A SEPARATE BAG AND PUT WITH MY STUFF), did not make it with my stuff. There were pictures of this in my inventory taken by makespace, and upon getting my inventory back to me, those photos were no longer apart of my inventory.....
------------
I just had my items delivered after about 6 months of storage, and thankfully, everything was in one piece! I didn’t have the best experience with customer service and management, but I can say that the amazing delivery service by Cristian and Juan totally left me with a good impression, and came as close to redeeming makespace as it could probably get. These men really brought excellent service! Thank you!<//Text>< Pics>

Juan, Demarco, and Fernando were the consummate professionals. They were extremely communicative, thoughtful, patient, and thorough and paid extreme attention to detail. They spent extra time ensuring that all my valuables and furniture were properly secured, wrapped, and stored. They were also extremely knowledgeable in answering questions that I had throughout the process and made moving - which can be extremely stressful - a superb experience. I would highly recommend these movers and Makespace.

Thank you for helping me “make space” as I begin a new life chapter.

Cheers!

I was helped by Josh, Jose, and Tim. I was not able to be physically present at the location of the move, so that made the situation a little bit more complex. However, the team was very communicative and made sure to cover every detail and checked in with me frequently. Thanks!<//text>

MakeSpace is the best!!! I moved my room out of my apartment over the summer because I went to stay with my family out of town for a while. MakeSpace came and picked up my stuff and packaged it - they were in an out in 30 min and covid safe! The pricing is really reasonable and I even had some of my furniture dropped off at my apartment a few months later and they automatically resized my storage unit which saved me about $30/month. I had the rest of my items dropped off yesterday so I could move it down to my parents house and it was super fast and convenient. Demarco and Bobby got to my apartment at 3 and loaded all my stuff into the van I rented in about 5 minutes. Great customer service and they were able to fit all my stuff somehow! I will definitely be using MakeSpace again & would recommend it to anyone.< /text>

Edit: second time getting delivery service with Yovanny and Christopher! Super efficient and communicated well that they were available earlier than scheduled!

Great team; fast and friendly (Juan and Abdullah)<//Review>

<Review>Dominic, Hector and Juan were incredibly helpful and professional, not to mention quick! They communicated the process so clearly and were so considerate of all safety precautions due to Covid19. I was truly impressed with how kind and careful they were with our things and with my health and safety!!! What a fantastic team of gentlemen!</Review>< pics>

Jesus and Juan showed up right on time wearing masks and adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. They came equipped with furniture pads, wrap, and boxes. They were quick and efficient yet extremely careful and respectful with valuable items. With all the options out there, definitely consider Makespace for their top notch logistics, technology, and people!< /Review>

<text>I would give half a star if I could.  At first I thought this company would be the solution to my moving conundrum.
Instead they have DEVASTATED most of my belongings and damaged most of the rest.  And best of luck getting anyone to represent you on their end - you get to tell your sad story to every support person they employ - no ONE representative to help you and tell you VITAL, timely information.  And best of luck with the web site.  A great idea, MakeSpace, but take a pass if you expect service, professionalism or accountability.<//text><date>1614558994455< /date>< Resp>

Great moving experience! Abdulla and Jose were a big help. I received makespace bags about 2 weeks in advance and packed the night before. The day of,  I received a text in the morning with their ETA, giving me time to prepare. Abdulla and Jose were friendly and made the moving process super easy!<//Review>

<review>I will be traveling for a few months before moving into a new apartment so I decided to store all of my belongings (couches, table, chair, TV’s, kitchen stuff, bedroom set) with MakeSpace. I received excellent service, both in setting up and executing the move. Bhavjeet and Eric were promptly on time, very efficient, careful with my storage items, and able to quickly adapt when they found out I had an additional couch and bed to store. I highly recommend using MakeSpace!< /review><gmap_id>0x808f796d4e3b209d:0x610ddc9035cb9018</gmap_id><user>112001748489676141333</user><time>1610748394885<//time><Response>{'time': 1611071468816, 'text': "Hi Brian,\n\nThank you for sharing your kind words for Bhavjeet and Eric!

<text>MakeSpace and particularly Josh & Hector went above and beyond expectations to help me execute a difficult interstate move.

My moving company canceled on my pickup 3 separate times before arriving >2 hours late on the 4th attempt. Josh stood by, and ensured the pickup went smoothly despite the confusing scheduling. He even texted me the paperwork the movers required but couldn’t figure out how to send me.

It’s hard to communicate how grateful I am. They were the bright spot in an otherwise abysmal move process. Thank you MakeSpace, Hector, and especially Josh.< /text>< Pics>

I’ve moved so many times before and this was for sure the least stressful one. Efficient, fast and safe. Joseph, Cristian, Darreus were extremely efficient and professional, and also polite, helpful and friendly. Also worth noting, since the year is 2020- they were great at keeping their masks on at all times and socially distancing themselves.

Makespace experience was seamless from getting my bags via mail, communicating up until pickup date and they also followed up right away with invoice updates afterwards.

I cannot speak for the experience retrieving my items yet but will follow up once I do.

10/10 recommend their services.< /review>

Jonathan and Cesar did a fantastic job carefully literally packing my apartment. Until the time to review the “bring back my things” appointment, this is definitely a 5 stars review!!! Will follow up!<//text>

<review>Josh, Chris, and Tim were great! Came exactly on time, were super quick, wore masks and were Covid safe. The whole process was very straightforward. I originally had booked Clutter but clutter curbside pickup sounded like you needed to move everything to the entrance. MakeSpace definitely doesn't!

Josh, Chris, and Tim came up 2 flights of stairs, had tools to help disassemble bed frame, wrapped furniture in blankets, and were patient in explaining how they protect your stuff and how they take pictures once it's in storage.

Their customer service on the phone was wish super helpful and patient when booking an appointment. Highly recommend! All in one moving service. And it's cheaper too!</review><username>Angela Park< /username>< resp>

Pickup process was well executed. Rico and Jonathan were great to work with. They did a fantastic job wrapping all the furniture. Hopefully drop off will be just as smooth.< /review>

Today on Thursday, June 25, 2020, I was supposed to welcome three Make Space movers into our home for a move. Several minutes beforehand, the Make Space team contacted us to say the move had been canceled because they were unable to find a truck. I paid hundreds of dollars to reserve a street permit spot in San Francisco for the truck. We need to be out of our apartment by the end of the month and now the other options for moving and storage are fully booked. I would not at recommend make space as a reliable solution for your move. We have used PODS before and we are kicking ourselves for not doing so this time around. We were so excited to try out a new up-and-coming company, but our first experience out of the gate has been disastrous. We are trying to contact the leaders and other others without success. I've received no response from the text feature. And make space has screwed up on several other requests, including a long delay in sending our green bin liners.<//Text><rating>1<//rating><user_name>Jeremy Welland<//user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Just came to drop off additional boxes as a new appointment at the warehouse. Abdullah and Christian and Jonathan and jose  Made a great job to assist me in this!

Initial review:
Really nice and convenient service! Easy to book the time, easy to control your belongings, good and friendly representatives.
Eric, Angel and Rico were very professional and easy to deal  with. They came on time, quickly took all my stuff and packed everything with care.
I had a really great experience so far and will recommend this company to my friends!</review>

MakeSpace has been a great experience. I find that it is as advertised and am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that a couple of my items came back damaged and one of my bags went missing. All things considered however, it's been a pretty seamless process and the pick-up and drop-off teams (Juan C. & Jose) have handled my items with care and followed strict C19 safety guidelines. MakeSpace is an easy service to use and I would definitely use them again in the future!</Review>

We had a wonderful experience with MakeSpace in Oakland. Abdullah and Angel and David were communicative, letting us know when they would arrive and where they parked. They were professional and efficient, moving 14 items out of our apartment in one trip! They were also very careful and respectful of our belongings. Plus, they’re patient, friendly, and genuine people. Thanks again, guys!<//review>

Fantastic service, very efficient and highly profesional.
Joseph, Cesar, and Rico did everything. They disassemble and package all furniture, picked up more than thirty makespace bags, and catalogued all items. In addition they kept al covid safety measures (face mask and distance). Thanks!< /Review>

<review>I love using MakeSpace and their team is always so great. Bhavjeet and Daniel we’re super friendly and efficient. They dropped off 15 items and it took only a few minutes. I would highly recommend this service to anyone in need of storage!< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Having to update this review to 2 stars. Been trying to reach customer service to schedule a 2nd appt to pick up last two remaining items. One is a fairly new AC unit, definitely wanted it stored. CANNOT REACH ANYBODY BUT MUSIC, and now I am being forced to junk the item. Movers great, customer service sucks. Two stars it is.

First time to use a storage company. Rates pretty reasonable, and for the actual move, these guys were great. Quick, careful with the items, and helpful when I had questions. I had a glass table which couldn't be moved as is, since glass was stuck to the base. They recommended they're disassembling it, forthright with me about signing a waver. The table was super old anyway, so ultimately decided to junk the item. I was just glad they recommended options that were feasible. I also need to schedule another appointment to pick up two more items, one was a portable AC unit that I couldn't part with just yet in this hot weather. The mover was helpful in suggesting that I first drain the unit to avoid leaking etc, and he even showed me how. Super great team, I'd highly recommend them!

Oh, can't forget to name the movers, who did such a wonderful job. Cristian, Andy, Joseph, and extra movers Juan C. and Angel 👍🏻</Review>

<Review>AVOID AVOID AVOID. I never write reviews, but felt obligated to post. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY WITH YOUR ITEMS. This company will LOSE YOUR ITEMS once they take them.

I used makespace for storage in San Francisco. When I went to the warehouse to pick up my items, 4 out of 10 items were missing. This included my mattress and side tables. I followed up with customer service immediately, but over 10 days, and the items have not been located.

I scheduled ANOTHER delivery appointment about 2 weeks later, and 5 of my items are still missing. This includes the same furniture pieces as before - mattress, side tables and valuable artwork. I am still sleeping on an air mattress 2 weeks later.

Despite calling customer support at least 5 times over the last 12 days, nothing has been remediated. I am considering filing a legal claim given the seemingly reckless operations of this company.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.<//Review><date>1605207860390< /date><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>1. Initial movers dented and damaged equipment as well as the walls of the apartment. They also threatened my uncle (assuming he was hired help and not family)

2. They confirmed they could deliver to my address before moving forward with the service. After the fact was “out of the delivery area”

3. The folks working on the help desk via phone are great, email, not so much.

4. Jonathon was the only good part of the experience. Went the extra mile. Very impressed. Followed best practices, very helpful, efficient and was very friendly. Photo attached. Kudos to you, Jonathon. Bad on you Makespace.

5. I recommend using Clutter. Exceptionally better experience. I also recommend Jonathon to go work for Clutter as well.

6. Buy bitcoin. (Not investment advice)<//Review>< userid>

The pickup was seamless, quick, and efficient. The team dissembled our furniture and moved all of our stuff with time to spare in our normal 3 hour appointment. The movers were beyond helpful and kind throughout the entire process. Would definitely recommend this service!</Text>

The experience with Makespace has been absolutely amazing. We had to store a whole two bedroom apartment and had a team of three professional movers come to pick up everything for free. Hector, Juan and Eric were incredibly helpful, friendly and diligent. They disassembled all the furniture and carefully packed it. They helped us with tips and gave us a lot of information on how Makespace works. All we had to do was packing the small stuff in advance in the bags they sent us and the rest was taken care of. I highly recommend this service if you want to store your stuff and need movers for it. The value is difficult to beat in any self-service alternative.< /review>

My movers Ryan and Fernando came on time, were very friendly and helpful. Wish I heard about makespace before the last time I crammed everything into a u haul and tetrised it into a storage unit. Everything went fast and smoothly, the only thing of note was they let me know they had a special box for the TV and it would be $15 more to wrap it up, which they handled quick. No fuss, would definitely recommend.</text>

Hello everyone! 👋🏻 I just finished moving out of my apt and had an awesome experience with MakeSpace. If you’re moving out of the city and looking for a storage company, I highly recommend them.

I did a lot of competitive research (Clutter, local moving companies, etc) and after talking to friends and companies on the phone, I went with MakeSpace! They made it so convenient to coordinate. They take care of pickup, transport, storage, and returns! All you do it pack up your stuff in green bags they send you in advance. Sooo easy. There were a lot of negative reviews on Yelp which made me a bit nervous, but it ended up being a fantastic experience.

Use my name Cherie Luo for $100 off your storage (you can give them my name over the phone). The MakeSpace pickup team (Armando, Rico, Juan) were professional, efficient, and COVID safe! Highly recommend!!!< /review>

<Review>[Edit: Abdullah and Fernando and Christian were able to come get items that had been forgotten on first pickup.]
Pickup of the bags and furniture from Cristian,   Darreus, and Demarco went really well, including some disassembly work, proper handling of fragile, heavy, and extra large items, all with a very professional yet friendly attitude, as well as responsible interactions regarding Covid. Would recommend and will use again in the future 👍<//Review>< Pics>

I'm truly sorry for the difficulty you've had getting in touch. We're currently experiencing a seasonal spike in demand related to COVID-19 that has delayed our usually prompt response times.

I had a great experience with team that delivered my items (Dominic, Jonathan, and Eric). I had around 50 things, including some large furniture. They worked fast and were professional. Offered to help in any way they could.

However, I will never be using MakeSpace again. There were a few minor problems with my stuff (missing and damaged items). I have tried to get in touch with someone on customer support but have not been able to reach an actual person.

I originally had told a few friends about this service but will now only consider using the competitor going forward just for the lack of customer service and respect for my items.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Review>Pretty disappointed with my experience - my assigned time slot was 12-3pm. My makespacers arrived close to 4 pm and I was not informed that there would be a delay. I called all phone numbers listed on the website around 10-15 times after 2 pm and no one picked up or called me back. I sent several emails as well, only one of which was responded to telling me that they would give me an ETA, which I never got.
Abdullah and Daniel were great, however it was clear that they were in a hurry to load my items due to the delay. Additionally, my stuff was just sitting out on the street with no one keeping an eye on them, so I had to stay by the truck while they brought down my other boxes. I won’t be surprised if some of my items are returned to me damaged.
I still have not received a response to my email and no one has called me back as yet despite my numerous calls and emails.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Unfortunately my bed (that I love!) got broken as they dismantled it and three months later the issue is still unresolved. I know it’s COVID, but doing the right thing when one of your employees makes an honest mistake, shouldn’t take months to muster.< /text>< response>

Makespace pick up review - Moving / storing / packing is stressful but had the most seamless experience, thanks to the makespace team and our movers Josh, Demarco and Ryan. Setting up your appointment and inventory was so easy on their website. They send you those makespace bags depending on how many you think you'll fill which makes the whole storing process so easy. The day of pick up Josh, Demarco and Ryan were so efficient, quick, careful, and safe it took all my worries away! Highly recommend, but still pending the "delivery of stored items" review</Text>

Very Professional Pick-up service by Jesus, Angel, & Roberto. Secured my items with additional tape and handled wirh care.

One thing to note is that the Makespace -provided wardrobe boxes don’t have a clothing rod (so I guess they are just boxes!!?). Luckily I had a FedEx across the street and the movers were patient as I went to go buy an actual wardrobe box for the move.< /text>

I recently moved to the West Coast and I have moved twice prepping for the close of my condo. Through out the process the teams assigned to manage my move where pretty solid guys, very knowledgeable about who to handle fragile and large items. << Move #1 in Nov. 2020 Jesus, Joseph, Caesar can to move us and took their time to ensure our home goods were properly handled. There was some miscommunication on Make Space customer service side, so when the guys arrived they were not expecting as many items, but they didn’t blink an eye they called their manager and got the ok! Which was a life saver as we were moving into a hotel while our home was being finished so they were our only option. << Move #2 Jan. 2021 Hector Juan and Fernando Did a great job unloading our home goods with care, they were very pleasant and communicated ahead of their arrival and let us know how long it would take to go pick up the second half of our stuff. I would use this company again, however there was damage to key items during this moving process, I plan to file claims and will update my review accordingly.<//Text>

Juan C and Angel were great. Made it really easy to move. Highly recommend the service

On the move back, Josh and Chris made it incredibly easy to retrieve my things.

Beware, they don't actually service the bay and if you pick up from their warehouse no assistance is provided.< /Text>< pictures>

I would use PODS if I ever need storage and moving again. Terrible customer service AFTER they have your stuff. They make it very difficult to get your stuff out with an out-of-state moving company. They damaged many of my items and did nothing about it. They packed my items terribly and broke almost everything that was made out of ceramic or glass. Even ceramic and glass items that I packed very well, smashed due to pressure or negligence.They were very cheap with tape and allowed bottoms to fall out. They mislabled boxes which lead to most of my things being broken.
Excellent pick up and packing experience.Juan, Daniel, and Juan were very courteous, professional and quick but unfortunately did not care to pack my items with care despite tips. Once they have your stuff they treat you like trash over the phone. Never again.</Text>

I had a great experience with MakeSpace! Dominic and Abdul were great - they were quick, friendly, and professional. Overall, the whole experience made moving out a lot less stressful. Highly recommend!

Update to review: I just experienced the delivery process as well to remove my items from storage and it's just as amazing! Seamless, easy, and overall great! Josh was quick and efficient in his delivery and excited to use MakeSpace in the future for any of my storage needs.</Review>

Makespace truly was storage without a struggle, up until pick up. Post the pickup, it went downhill....

My appointment was about a month ago, but I still have not gotten any confirmation from the team about my things in storage (supposed to take 3 days or so). When I reached out to CS after week 2 , they said 4 of my items are still being processed and "they don't know why." They said they reached out to ops to process, but I'm still waiting. Although they were kind, CS just made me worry more, because they sounded clueless themselves --didn't seem like they had the info they need to help. I was also told  "there was very little I can do for the unprocessed items."

What am I supposed to do? Just hope that I can get my stuff back some day?

Cherry on top --  based on the photos of my items currently posted by Makespace, it should be more than 4 items that still need to be processed. Alas, it's hard to tell, because the team packed a bunch of things in their own box without labeling what is inside...I tried to ask my CS rep to help me find out what's inside, to no avail.

They closed their support phone lines, so I can't reach anyone in person. A few days ago I expressed my concern that I'm worried my stuff is missing & asked if something is going on at the warehouse ...no response.

I get that their demand is crazy due to COVID. People at the company must be stressed. If that is the case and so things are just hectic and there are significant issues, Makespace should have just let me & other customers know so at least we can wait in peace while hopefully they figure things out. It's really frustrating having to spend so much time & mindshare to ensure a storage company, well, actually stored my things. I'm just glad I didn't store any important documents.

The movers who showed up were truly fantastic though --showed up on time, super polite, got my things out of my apartment really fast. My rep who assisted up to my pickup, was also great. I'm sad to be leaving such a bad review.<//Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>tanya carter<//user_name><Text>I wish I could give Makespace 0 stars. I booked a pickup several weeks in advance, provided as much information as possible, and made it clear I lived in SF where parking and traffic are notoriously hectic. On the day of my move, Makespace arrived and called me to say they could not complete the pickup because "there was nowhere to park." This was absolutely untrue. I sent multiple pictures of places they could park, but they clearly did not feel like completing my pickup. This put me in an incredibly difficult situation where I had to personally book a uhaul and do the move myself. And what do you know - we had absolutely no trouble parking the 12' Uhaul. Makespace is a shady business with no regard for the customer. Also keep in mind, they do not take a deposit, which essentially means they can pull stuff like this and they aren't on the hook. 0 stars - do not take the risk with these guys.<//Text><GmapID>0x808f796d4e3b209d:0x610ddc9035cb9018< /GmapID><pics>None<//pics>< date>

<Name>Mari S. Bae<//Name><Date>1565805563892< /Date><rating>1<//rating><review>Horribly deceiving company. First, they took one extra box from me which I told them not to, and without my consent, they upgraded the space because they said my initial choice wasn't enough. Because of that one extra box they took, I went from 400 cubric feet to 600 cubric feet. So they've been charging me $249 a month instead of $169. Second, I went back to their website and checked the price. On the website, 600 cubric feet is quoted at $169. I noticed that I've been paying almost $100 more than what the website says. When I contacted them, they said "that's the price you are locked up." And they were not willing to change. I feel so deceived by how they do business and I lost trust. I have absolutely no willingness to recommend this company to anyone.</review>< pictures>

{'time': 1565822940497, 'text': "Hi Mari,\n\nI'm so sorry that your experience with MakeSpace hasn't lived up to the high standards we hold ourselves to. I've asked a member of our Customer Support team to reach out to you directly tomorrow so we can make this right.\n\nQuoted prices are based on a number of factors, including the location of your first pickup as well as when you signed up for MakeSpace. Because your rates are locked in at the time of pickup, we guarantee that your rates will never increase for the same plan. In this instance, I see that the items picked up measured into a slightly larger storage plan, which led to the increased price. I'm truly sorry for any inconvenience this caused, however I'm confident that we'll be able to make this right.\n\nAs a follow-up, a member of our team will reach out tomorrow with additional information and next steps.\n\nAll the best,\n\nSean\nCustomer Experience Manager"}< /response>
