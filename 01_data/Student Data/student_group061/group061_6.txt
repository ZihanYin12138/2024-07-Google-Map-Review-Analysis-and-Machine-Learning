I appreciate the friendliness of staff. I especially appreciate being able to make an appointment online. And of course, the doctors take the time to be thorough and explain options. I have been going to Golden Optometric for  more than 50 years.<//Text>

I've been coming here for the past 15 years and Dr. David Ardaya is a great Doctor and professional. He answers every question that you may have as well as concerns. The staff here are very polite and will help you look for the right pair of glasses if needed. I highly recommend anyone who wears glasses which carries a good variety of brands.<//review>

<Review>All of the staff and Doctors are so wonderful here. They don’t make you feel rushed and they spend plenty of time with you. The doctors are very nice and make you feel special when you are there. I am a very indecisive person and it always takes me a long time to pick a frame. They have always helped me to pick the right frame no mater how long it took me. I would recommend this eye doctor to everyone I know.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I was looking for a new optometrist to go to, since my last doctor closed their facility. My girlfriend recommended this place as she has been coming here for years and says she loves the experience every time. The staff there was extremely friendly, from the phone call to make my appointment, down to when I walked in the office. They assisted me very quickly, and I was seen by Dr. David Ardaya. Super cool guy! Very friendly, professional, and took his time to chat and answer questions for me. This was the first time I did not feel rushed or uncared for by a medical professional. Most times when you go see any doctor, it doesn't really seem like they care much about your questions or concerns. Its more like they just want to get things over with. But here, I didn't feel that way at all. They're also taking very high precautions due to the pandemic. The office is extremely clean, machines, chairs, and even the door handles are being disinfected after every use. Lastly, choosing a new pair of glasses was so easy. The gentleman that helped me, Jorge, was very patient and got me exactly what I asked for. He brought me several pairs of glasses to try on, so I had a big variety to choose from, which was great. He explained to me what might work best when getting my glasses for me, based off of what the doctor was recommending, and was able to break down to me what my final fees would be. He answered my questions and was a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend this place, and I think I now know where I want to continue to come! This place is just great! 10/10 recommend. The best experience at a doctor I've ever had!</text><pics>None</pics>< UserId.>

I bought some reading glasses, and they needed to be adjusted because I actually needed them for my computer which is held farther away than a book. So, they changed them for me with no cost and within 10 days. I really appreciated all of the safety measures they take and their professionalism. They really want to make sure the customer is happy. I am for sure going to go back next year for future needs, and I highly recommend them.<//review>

<text>I’ve been going to Golden Optometric for my eye exams for many years now. Every one of my yearly appointments have been a pleasant experience. The facility is clean and modern. The staff are always polite and professional. David Ardaya, O.D. is a very personable physician. Although, I only visit once a year, he remembers me which is rare these days.  He always makes you feel like he cares and he really explains in laments terms about the state of your vision and what is best for you-especially in regards to getting prescription glasses. The business has a very large selection for eye glasses choices with some of the top designer companies.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>I live near the Hollywood area but I drive all the way to Whittier just because of the Great customer services all staff members are very helpful with each and  every patient and of course taking all COVID precautions as the CDC recommends very limited patients temperature checked. Dr. Ardaya took his time to listen to all my questions and concern. Also i brought a pair of sunglasses that they fit me big and they adjusted at no cost. Over all I'm a happy patient.</Text>< pics>

Absolutely love the customer service received!  Every time we walk in the office we are greeted with a smile and very helpful employees.  I feel the doctor spent more than enough time with us explaining our needs and making sure we had what we wanted as well.  The process for ordering contacts & getting fitted was awesome.  They took the time to teach my 10 year old how to care for his contacts and put them in and out.  I would highly recommend this office for anybody in need of an eye doctor!<//Review>

This was something that my LA CARE Insurance covered, so I went and scheduled an appointment. Their appointment reminders and scheduling is easy and fluid.

< Review>
All of my experiences with Golden Optometric over a decade or more have been top notch. The Optometrists are excellent, the support staff is excellent and the opticians are excellent. I give them 5 stars in all categories and 10 out of 10 on that scale.<//Review>

Dr. Ardaya is such a great doctor. We look forward to getting our eyes checked annually. He is so kind, and really educates us so that we want to make our eye check ups a priority. You won’t be disappointed!< /Review>

My husband and I had been going to another optometry office, but once they changed doctors they also changed prices of the glasses, so we looked for a different provider. As soon as we walked in we felt good being there. We were greeted right away and because there are 4 or 5 receptionists there never seems to be a long line. We are very glad we chose Golden Optometric Whittier. Another reason we like this office is because it is very close to home.</review>

Having been using Golden Optometrics for over 45 years, and I have gone from father to son over the years.  They are accurate, concerned and friendly.  I highly recommend the doctors here.

Can you find quicker production of lens and frames, yes, but we come for the quality and the honesty.  The ability to come for adjustments, cleanings and repairs will bring you back!<//text>

However, depending on where the metal frame breaks, sometimes it has to be welded to be put back together; it’s not simply a matter of a new screw or temple to be replaced.

My glasses broke yesterday morning I went to see if could be fixed. The guy at the door said NO needed to be welded or just get a new pair. I don't believe I will be going back to this place. Bye<//Text>

Dr. Ardaya always listens to how my vision has been working, and when I'm content with how I'm seeing, he doesn't push me to change, even though the data may show I might benefit from it. He is in the profession to serve over the long haul, and has a servant's heart.</text>

<Text>If you come across Golden Optometric look no further!!! This IS the place for you!

Just visited Dr. Dave Ardaya at Golden Optometric in Whittier! I cannot say enough about Dr. Ardaya and his staff. From the moment I walked in I was politely greeted, checked out their amazing selection of eye glasses and had a brief wait in their comfortable waiting room until I was able to meet with Dr. Ardaya.

I came in for a sty. Dr. Ardaya checked both eye lids, my vision, and the interiors of my eyes. Dr. Ardaya then gave me a thorough explanation of my condition, showed me on the diagram about my infection and explained what it was doing to my eyes. Dr. Ardaya has great patience in answering all my questions.

I highly recommend Dr. Ardaya and this practice!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

A quality visit for my family. What pleased me the most, was how the dentist handled telling my daughter about her "lattice" condition and the post bad-news comfort her explanation provided.< /text>

<review>I have been using the Golden Optometric Group for my eye care needs for nearly 27 years.  Even though I lived in La Habra, I first started going because it was relatively close to my workplace in Pico Rivera.  I continued going after I was transferred to El Segundo in 1999  because I was so impressed with the care I received over the years from Sheldon and David Golden, their optician staff and office support staff that it made it worth the extra drive.  Their practice has continued to grow over the years and they have added additional doctors that clearly understand the 'Golden' philosophy of the patient's needs will be satisfied through professional and truly caring attitudes.<//review>< pics>

I got the Greek salad with grilled chicken and Greek dressing. Very tasty. And they gave me a huge amount of grilled chicken. Half a mile from work. Excellent place for lunch. Service was prompt and friendly. Will be coming back.</Review>

Spaghetti Dinner was mainly Green Bell Pepper tangy sauce over very old noodles. Soggy garlic sandwich bread. And WAY over priced sodas!!!! I gave a two because the customer service was better than I expected it to be. Not great by any means, but better than expected.< /review>

Pastrami tastes like turkey pastrami instead of beef and lacked flavor.  Menudo had lots of meat but no flavor and only a touch of hominy.  Zucchini rounds  are not the same taste as zucchini strips.  I miss Niles Street seasoning cook.</text>

<Text>I live in Italy and have an account at this branch. I needed to speak with someone at the branch regarding my account but, was recycled through the useless recording.  I tried several times (also at another branch only to be met with the same recording).  A waste of money and time!!  PS.  Do not respond by referring me to online or mobile service!  I need an actual person help me with my request!

I have added to my review.  This seems to be the only way to communicate with this bank.  I was referred to contact BOA through FB message.

This B of A branch has 4 ATM machines, which work perfectly.  I seldom step inside the branch since most of my transactions happen at the ATM.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer with little complaints, nevertheless, B of A is like all other financial institutions -- they want to hold your money and take a cut of it.</Text>

Not to happy with Bank of america rigth now banks are closed atm's all true Moreno valley not working what's going on..<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><response>None<//response><Text>Frankly, I don't even want to give 1 star at all. Today, I need to share my experience with BOA at Town-gate Plaza, Moreno Valley, CA.
It is a terrible place and disgusting. I was a first coming person waiting to talk to a Bank Teller. A Hispanic guy came to welcome and told me to wait, he will find someone to help me. I was waiting there and charting with my phone to kill the long waiting time about 20 minutes. Suddenly, a Hispanic guy served another guy just walked in and took him to the room. I asked him, I am here first and how long should be the waiting time. He said, because that just walked-in guy is discussed about BUSINESS. He told me I have to wait 10 more minutes or schedule an appointment if I want. So, the Business issue is more important than a Credit card issue? that's why I was waiting there for 20 minutes, no body came to provide me any service? and provided service right away for a guy just walked-in?
For me, it's a discrimination. I think, because I dressed like a poor guy with no education. That's why they treated me badly.
Hopefully, BOA listen to the voice of customers, make a change in the future to improve the quality of customer care.</Text>< GmapID>

B of A is not like other banks DO NOT care about there Guest needs, taking advantage with the Covid Situation situation per there employee no need for so many banks to be close it’s because bank fronts is not money maker so they are opening late & closing every the few banks that are open. BofA is large and DO NOT CARE! 1000% shows in there action and reported by there staff!<//Review>

This should be UNACCEPTABLE to this branch and management ,but they SEE only 1 or 2 bank attendants tending to a line of 25plus customers and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it to fix this problem.

<text>This bank has a locker facility which is visible to public in parking place with a big sign 'Safety Locker'. Robbers can clearly see who is going in and coming out.  I just  put some stuff in my locker and drove back to mall. With in 2 min I came back only to see my broken car window and  my back pack missing. Thank god I don't have any valuables. I don't know if its inside job or locker being in wrong place visible to public. There is absolutely no safety if you were using  locker facility.< /text>< rating>

Had to call in 4 times to get someone to answer,  when I asked to get a temporary card Chris said they were out of them. I bet if I wanted to open up an account I would've gotten one. Never going here again because if had issues with them before and I am switching banks just because of this location.<//Text>

<Review>These scumbuckets racially profiled my roommate and denied him services that I had easily been freely given in the same situation:

These guys....I had a situation where I had my wallet stolen. They asked my SS# and phone, and gave me access to my account and a new temp ATM.
A week later, my roommate, who'd gotten his wallet taken too, they refused to give him a temp ATM, and denied his access to his funds

We are both mid 50's. We asked for the same thing. I got service, and my roommate got denied while I was served.
I am Anglo.
My roomate is Latino.

We can all do the math.

I went in with him to confront them about this inequity.
.
He walked away with his money...after I called them on it.

<review>First of all, I always use the atm. So the one time a year I go into the bank I swipe my debit. At the branch on perris they don't require you to fill out the form. And like I said I hardly enter the bank.  This is my first time in months and i decide to visit this bank. I had about 20 people ahead of me. I still waited due to having more than 40 bills to deposit. Once I finally made it to a teller I get a lecture from a guy named Brad about filling out the paper and how Incomvienced Him by not doing so. I explained I wasn't aware that the banks still do those. He proceeded to help me with am attitude then he asked me why I didn't go to the atm. I told him I had more than 40 bills. He explained that I could have deposited if I did it twice. I told him I already waited in line therefore I rather just do it here. He then gave more attitude.  This is so terrible. Never have I seen such unprofessinalism. I understand i was in the wrong for not filling out the paperwork but like I said I am not used to it so I didn't think it was needed. Had he been more friendly my experiance would've been better. I don't understand. If you do not like your job why continue working at an establishment.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dca8aa3798dbfd:0xd37abec74db84460</Gmap_id><response>None</response>< pictures>

<Review>I needed to do a transaction.  Had to go back twice.  I was given a phone number to check on the transaction to follow up and was told I had to go INTO the bank.  I called the bank and the prerecorded message says everyone is busy and hung up on me. Not so good.< /Review><name>Dplessel</name>< GmapID>

I placed an order through the mobile app and when I arrived they have me a venti iced tea? I ordered an Iced London fog tea latte and this is not it. They refused to correct my order. Very disappointed and wasted star points for this.</text>

Went into starbucks and ordered food and a drink.  Requested that the barrista place my items in a bag.  She goes and gets a bag, and doesn’t place items in.  Meanwhile, a white customer in the store has a bag with her items handed to her.  It ridiculous that this happens, and it shouldn’t.  Treat all customers the same- with respect and dignity.  Next time, when a customer has several items in their order, just put it in a damn bag!< /Text>

Ordered two breakfast sandwiches and two iced chestnut praline lattes via Uber eats. The lattes were both incorrect, we received normal chestnut lattes. I double checked my order to make sure I hadn’t made a mistake and I hadn’t.

Not only that but the sandwiches arrived FREEZING COLD. I worked at a Starbucks 6 years ago or so and whoever packed these literally took them out of their plastic wrapping and put them in a bag to go. Ridiculous.<//review>

Really bad customer service at this place. I asked for any keto options or sugar free options and the cashier completely unanswered my question and stayed quiet before she looked to her coworker and asked her the question, her co worker gave an answer but just a bit rudely, the first cashier even chuckled at me as if my question was funny, both young ladies were rude and not very helpful at all.</text>

Smaller sized Starbucks. Good for a quick stop, but not a really long-term study spot. Please don't make a U-Turn from Grove Way to go there: it's illegal and not safe. Go through Center, and go back through the Chevron.< /review>

I had to ask for my mobile order to be made after waiting for 15 minutes. Then they gave me a drink with ice touching the bottom of the container. Can’t see how I was even close to being rude so don’t know what’s going on in the baristas head.

Take the 5 minutes to drive to the other Starbucks in CV if you really want it.< /text>< Pics>

Updated to 1 start.
Ordered a trenta cold brew (so it's already brewed) and 15 minutes ago.

Legitimately the slowest Starbucks ever.
Love the people, but if you're in a hurry - don't bother.

My mobile orders take 20 min minimum and up to 40 minutes.<//review>

To many homeless people who bring their dogs in to get warm. I understand that it's cold, but don't go into a food establishment to get warm there's other outlets for that. 1st and foremost the people who work there and are trained to work there should do a better job of keeping a safe and healthy environment.<//text>

When it's busy ,,WHY don't you have a second person at the register.its very poor service to have to wait while u have 7 to 8 workers and only one clerk at the till I think quicks service is much more important than some guy sweeping the floor you can sweep the floor when you're not busy so half the time I walk out you losing a very large order at least six or seven dollars< /Text>

I wasn't able to drink it since I order on my app on my way out of town. $8 in the garbage so far and no coffee. I don't know if there's some cross contamination or what. I drink the same drink from every Starbucks I go to, one being at my job 5 days a week and it's never like that. I give up on this Starbucks, I literally have a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth for hours after one sip</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Usually the service is top notch but since the big feather started making drinks it's something to be desired for. My frapucino had more ice than green tea and drink was 3/4 not full. To justify $5 drink you need to do better!< /text>< Rating>

I have been a customer of Starbucks at this location for many many years. Although parking is a problem sometimes, its worth it to me because everyone that works there are energized- ready to work polite and go out of their way to give you the best customer service.. For any chance your drink is not to your liking just let them know and they will fix it.
Thank you  Victoria, Kayla, Paris, just to name a few</review>

< review>
Stopped in for what I thought would be a quick grab and go. The shop closed at 10 as most Starbucks do, however at 935pm I tried to order a sandwich. The barista said she could not make any food as the ovens were off. Then she backtracked and said she could, one is still on. They only had a few breakfast tsandwhiches, they had cleaned out all the food items from the front open chiller, irritated and hunger I moved on to my brothers and my  drink order. It was very clear she wasnt happy to be helping us at that moment. And then to make it better after I drove off and got down the road I realized she kept my change. I loaded $10 on my card paid with a $20. When I called she knew right away she had messed up.< /review>

One of the best gaming store experiences for Magic the Gathering that I have even had. This store has a great selection of cards and the service is top notch. They are very generous with their store credit in terms of Magic the gathering cards.<//Review>

Had to go back and leave a review- CALLING ALL SCV NERDS PLEASE DO ALL YOUR LOCAL CARD SHOPPING/SELLING/PLAYING HERE!!!!
Organization of cards is a serious art and these folks have it down. Make a list and go make your wildest decks come true. They have fleshed out all my demands: slivers, rares, angels, cats, sphinxes, etc.
I have been around to the other local card shops and none compete, unless you like spending 20 years searching through incomplete binders 🤷‍♀️</text>

Nice store, but I felt lowballed by their offer to buy my Magic singles. It was by far the lowest quote I got (by nearly 40%). The clerk was incredibly nice, and he wasn't the owner so it's definitely not on him. He was careful with my cards, and I appreciated the time. However, I don't believe they are as interested in buying singles as I would have believed when I first walked in.</text>

I have been going here for a while now enjoying the pre releases and other events they hold. Pricing on product is better than everything in the area and the staff there helps me with my scrubby decks from time to time.< /text>

I am new to the area, and was glad how friendly and fun the staff were including their usual customers. I made some great friends here, and once school is finished for the quarter, i hope to partake in more Legacy events. The other great thing is that their prices on singles are really good!!! You'll have a better chance getting singles here cheaper than any other local area.

Plus, this place is a 25min drive from where i live, but it is totally worth it!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Definitely one of the friendliest shops I've ever been to. Luna, the owner, is great and the players there are beyond friendly. Fair prices, multiple events each week, and average prize support. The store may not look much, but the experience is definitely one of the best out there.</Text>

Selling brand new cards at double manufacturer cost on day one of release.  Then told me its ok cause everyone does it.  There is a special layer of hell for people like this.

Whatever excuse you want to use for price gouging a childrens game.</Review>

Magic at it's finest. The owners are personable, and the groups of players run from the casual to the competitive. I usually go in an just talk shop. Pricing wise they are spot on, meaning you can get some of the TCG Player deals without having to wait.< /Text>

<Text>After going here for an mtg prerelease I won't go anywhere else.  It's a bit of a drive for me but totally worth it.  The staff are very helpful and the prices are low.  They give out many prizes during their events.  Even without winning you really feel like you got your moneys worth and more.<//Text><rate>5< /rate></record>

<Review>The pre-release events are always packed and the best players in the scv valley always shop here. They honor pretty close to tcg player prices, which is as fair market as I've seen around. And Mr. Luna always answers my rules questions over the phone oh-so politely. Can't ask for much else.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Unfair owners favor their normal customers over first timers. Played a random format called the swiss format and picked their favorites to win the tournament. I was tied with the owners favorite player but he was chosen to win and I wasn't for some rule they had to make up.</Review>

Nice spot for delicious Chinese food. Two thumbs up for this place. Certainly worth a return trip. The bill was good for what you get. Reminds me of a place in New York I loved to visit.</text>

Food was very good.  I especially liked the quick service.  Walked up ordered and served in 5 minutes maybe less.  Food was delicious.  My only complaint, ordering rice a la carte, but that must be a West Coast thing.< /text>

Seriously good lunch specials! The shrimp are huge and tender in the walnut shrimp, lemon chicken is excellent and lots if meat and veggies in the combination chow mein. Long time customer that likes to hit this place before going to Costco!<//Review>

The food was great. The waiters are old school and don't all speak great English or make eye contact. But they were attentive and more importantly, the quality of the four tasty dishes we had was high. And the prices reasonable. We will be back!</review>

<UserId.>102609114153098374609< /UserId.><Text>Wow, for a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall this place is a winner! It has the freshest food I have ever eaten since Hong Kong, it was that good. We had Won Ton soup to start, Chicken Salad, Chicken Chow Fun, Sweet and Sour Prawns, Pork/Chicken/Shrimp Fried Rice and Lemon Chicken. Can't tell you prices as I went with friends who eat there twice a week (same friends I went to Hong Kong with all those years ago), and they ordered and paid. The food was wonderful and everyone is quite friendly.  Being so far from home, I even ran into another friend I hadn't seen in a while.

Food is OK, not bad by any means but not great either.. Customer service is trash though.. The lady basically dropped my plate on the table and walked off.. They got mad when I followed them to the kitchen to request an extra plate.. The language barrier wouldn't be a problem if they were patient</Review>

Happy Garden has undeniably the best honey walnut prawns you will find anywhere...
We always order
Mongolian beef
Peking beef
Pork & string beans. (a little spicy)
and of course the Honey walnut prawns.. with the house fried rice.< /Review>

Sweet and sour chicken + chicken fried rice was okay. Not the best I've ever had.

Service was terrible. Server barely talked to us, didn't greet us. They sat around watching TV. Definitely gave off the vibe they didn't want us there. Bathrooms were a little.... Not so great. I think that says a lot about the care they put into the rest of the place.<//text>

Literally some of the best Chinese food ive ever had.
Their fried chickens are actually 90% CHICKEN. Dishes are full of flavor, moderate pricing, and pretty good dish sizes!</Text>

We ordered two chicken items to go.  When we got back to our hotel, we found the two chicken dishes and no rice.  We were not informed when we ordered that rice was extra...and it is included at 99%+ of the other Chinese restaurants we've been to.

Check your order!<//review>

<text>Well-intentioned gentleman who answers calls and asks for call-back number, without follow-through on the callback. Several clients in line waiting for rental or drop-off (a drop box would be very useful), and though there was only one representative on duty, didn't feel like there was any hustle. And disappointingly, no manager to assist the frontline staff member (definitely not picking up/dropping off clients). It appears from previous reviews that this place is chronically understaffed, but you will get competitive rates. For now, while they're extremely busy as travel picks up, be there early and prepared to wait for your rental vehicle. Good luck!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Reserved a cargo van for an important trip I was taking to move my elderly brother. It was a long trip , so I needed it by noon. The reservation was at 10:30am. They had 2 on-site. One had starting problems and the other needed an oil change. Although this was known before I arrived it was only when I was there that it was addressed. The agent said he would try to find another, but that would take hours. Trip was called off with consequences for my brother. Grade for Hertz: F-<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Have a reservation? Doesn't matter. Your car won't be ready. They just have to "clean it up first." "It will only be 15 minutes, thanks for your patience," they say.

That's after you finally get to the counter. They are consistently understaffed.

Good luck. Enterprise is only a block away. It took an hour to finally get my car.</review>

<text>DO NOT USE THIS CAR RENTAL SERVICE. Worst experience ever! They rented me a car that had a known tire leak and since I was stranded in the desert, I had to buy a brand new tire to get home. I tried calling hertz 3 days in a row and was told to just put air in it. The tire place told me I was lucky I didn’t have a blow out. The same car was 6k miles past due on an oil change and I had to take care of that maintenance as well. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was informed he left out the back door cause he didn’t have time to deal with it at the moment. They refused to give me contact information for anyone until other customers started being affected. They knowingly gave me an unsafe car and refused to address it. I will never use hertz again and urge others not to as well if you value your safety.<//text><name>Sarah Rawls< /name><Date>1615857280365<//Date>< user_id>

They were friendly and professional. I got a great deal, and they had a nice choice of vehicles. Just about a 20 - 30 minute wait when I got there. Another 10 -15 waiting for the car to get cleaned up.<//Review>

Absurdly rediculous. Won't answer their phone, super rude employees. And don't worry if you make a reservation they will give your car away. Because apparently they have several people make reservations for the same vehicle and whoever shows up first gets it.</Text>

Horrible service.... i had to walk out. Enterprise here i come.

Only 2 people working the counter, a line of 6 people. The one guy working was busy talking (non business)to his customer as if they were old friends, never did he apologize to the customers waiting or saying we will be with you as soon as we can.<//Text>

I was rear ended recently. My insurance company had me rent a car from Hertz while my car was in the shop. I loved that rental car. The whole process was very smooth. The ladies were wonderful. They found a car that I felt safe in. The check in and out only lasted a few minutes and I was free to live my life.< /Text>

I made an 0830 prepaid reservation with “Jessica” over the phone with the national number since the actual store would not answer the phone.  When I arrived there were two people standing behind the desk and no customers.  They proceeded to tell me they had no vehicles available till after 1000.  I called the store 6 times after 10 to see if they had a vehicle.  They would not answer phone and I was sent to customer service in Mexico City.  They were very unhelpful.  I spoke to two supervisors, one of them was Michael.  I was disconnected from both the calls.  No return call was made.  Do yourself a favor and pay a couple extra dollars for customer service because Budget is not going to give you that.< /review>< date>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>Really bad experience that was kind of saved by a coworker.  I reserved a truck for pick up at 10:00 am.  My travel plans got delayed and I called early to let them know I wouldn’t arrive until 12:30. I arrived at exactly at 12:30 and there was no truck.  I had to wait in the office for an hour while they picked up a truck from being serviced and then cleaned it. No one seemed particularly bothered by or apologized for renting my truck to someone else despite being proactive about my impending arrival time. Fortunately, while I was waiting, the staff who helped me went to lunch and a new staff member helped fill me in on what was going on and expedited me getting on the road.  Hence two stars instead of one.  Mostly, I just want my time back — that’s more important to me than the frustration of dealing with people who don’t care.  This will definitely be my last time renting from this office.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I'll start this review with the good stuff. The lady who assisted me was great. While my overall experience at this location was not positive I could tell she was doing the best she could with a bad situation. I wish I remembered her name because she deserves a raise.

Now for the bad stuff. This location is only open till noon on Saturdays which causes a big back log of people needing to pick up up their rentals and also people needing to return their rentals. It took me an hour to get my car since they ran out of cars and were waiting for people to do returns so they could immediately give those cars out to at least a dozen people who were waiting in the small location office.

The staff did the best they could with the limited resources they had and they were able to deal with irritated customers in a professional manner.

My advice to the public would be to avoid renting from this location on a Saturday or if you have to make the reservation for Saturday, make it as early as possible in the day.

My advice to the management of this location would be to consider leaving the office open an extra few hours on Saturdays to prevent these sorts of backlogs.

Last note, while they didn't have the time to fully detail the car before giving it to me it was clean and it worked perfectly.

Cheers.</Text>

Pretty disappointed overall. Customer service needs some improvement. There were a few nice employees, but the ones that were in charge seemed disorganized. It took 40 minutes for them to get my rental ready, even with an appointment. The car itself worked fine though.<//text>

friendly, speedy check out.  The representative did have a hard time finding a car that did not need service and went through 4 cars before getting me a car.  Internal workings with team members correctly servicing cars before releasing the car would have sped up the process</Review>

I am glad Enterprise opens its office on Saturdays till noon time. It will give me time to return the rental vehicle on time. The agents are courteous and fairly quick; attending to the customers. The vehicle I rented is comfortable enough for myself since I suffer from a spinal injury.
I will definitely recommend Enterprise ( Temecula, CA ).< /text>

<Text>This place is terrible. I called ahead for a truck or SUV because my car was in the shop. They told me they would have a truck guaranteed. Wrong, I get in the guy who picked me up had no clue how to assist with car seat. I wait 10 minutes before even being greeted to get my paperwork started. Then they don't have a truck it was gone. So they proceed to a Ford explorer and in the middle of my transaction another agent comes in and says they needed it for their clients reservation. The whole reason I asked for a truck was because I have a double stroller that does not fit in many cars including some minivans and smaller SUVs. O would never come here if this wasn't being handled by insurance.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
My insurance company State Farm arranged a rental car with this local office and I simply went there to pick it up. It is a small office with a small sign, tucked in a shopping mall. They don't even have their own lot. Very easy to pass this mall. The office was understaffed. Only one lady was working on the computer and six or seven people were waiting. They were all complaining about the long wait.

When returning the car two weeks later, the employee (named Rowell) who was processing the return was unprofessional as well as incompetent. It took him  at least five minutes to identify me and the car on the computer.  Believe it or not, his first question was, "where did you rent this car from?", may be by partly because the car had an out-of-state plate. And he asked me how to spell my name on three different occasions during the return process.

I am not still 100% confident whether this guy has processed the return correctly.<//review>

I had an awesome pick up experience. Hertz Employee was friendly and helpful. Also, my return experience was excellent. The only issue which I did not like , that I don't choose my car.
This time I was lucky to get a hybrid car, as I drove almost 3k miles.but what if I did not get a hybrid?
Price was good for me , not low not high.
Thanks,,,,< /review>

I have been a president circle member four a couple of years now. . Spend 6-7k a yr on business and some leisure. Luis is the manager & believe comes from a regional position. Always makes me feel as if my dollar is $1000. Not the cheapest so don't go there if you're looking for the cheapest in my opinion. If you're looking for a fair deal with a great car that is safe and really hasslefree as far as picking up & invoices. I normally do not write reviews but they really stood out recently.</review>

<text>Horrible experience, I reserved  a car for this morning.  I got a ride to Hertz and my daughter left to work. I have never had this happen to me at a car rental place where they tell me that they don't have a car for me.  Even though I have a Reservation number. They did offer to put me on a waiting list and I'll be the first they call IF they get a return car. IF!!!! Well they know what they can do with there IF. I walk across the street to enterprise rental car. What a difference atmosphere friendly people verry curtiss.  I left verry happy.</text>< Gmap_id>

This is place is not friendly to the customer. I asked if I can use the bathroom, Diane stated that their bathroom is not used for the public. I stated I am a customer. I have been renting to this place for a while now and today they stated that they're going to put a hold $200 on my credit card since this is my "first time" as a Gold member. NEVER again, I am not going back here anymore.< /Text>

<review>Luis provides horrible customer service. Reserved a cargo van car but when I got there they did not have it. I asked if they had a Pickup truck, which is about $10 cheaper than the van, and they said they had one available. Luis said if I was ok with the approximate $10 difference in price and I said I was. Got the rental receipt to sign and it was $10 more expensive than the price of the pickup listed online. I asked why the difference and Luis said because I already had a reservation. Luis added a $10 upgrade fee. Why would you charge a customer an upgrade fee when (1) it wasn't an upgrade, (2) it was their fault they didn't have the vehicle I reserved? I showed Luis the online price and I said if I reserve the truck online I would get it at that price. Luis said he wouldn't honor that price.
I told Luis to cancel my reservation and I walked home...2 miles.
During my walk I called customer service and asked for a regional manager to address my experience. The representative said she sent an email to the manager over that branch and that I would get a call within 24 hours. That was 7 days ago and I received no call. I have been going to Hertz exclusively for years and I have never had customer service this bad.<//review>< user_name>

An hour and a half later we still didn’t have a car and were told it was being cleaned. We finally got the car after many inquiries and it was filthy. There was  trash in car from the previous renter.  I turned to the lady helping me and told her we just waited an hour and a half so you could clean the car. She replied back “it’s a hot day, were doing the best we can.” If that wasn’t bad enough hertz charged me a $30 ticket violation after I had already paid the ticket. When I phoned  them to get it removed they told me that the  ticket was not paid on time so there would be no refund. I would never use this company again. After replying to their survey no one got back to me to make things right.<//Text><Response>None</Response><Rating>1</Rating>< pictures>

Loved the car -- a Hyundai Sonata -- they are so busy here checking in and out can be a challenge (I think they need to hire more personnel and a bigger space).  But got a really great rate online and everyone was very cordial and helpful.  Thank you Hertz.< /Review>

I rented a car, there were issues with the car. Smelled pretty bad and was not as clean as I would have liked.

I called to ask if I could trade cars. Cameron was very nice and apologetic. I was given an upgrade for free of a very nice car.

I do think the car should have been cleaned, the way in which the oversight was dealt with was quick generous and professional.

We can all make mistakes, it's what we do after that is important

Thank you Cameron
I love my new ride!< /Text>

First in line....last to leave after cars were magically not available anymore.  Four people received their rentals while we waited, even though our reservations were slotted before them.  Over an hour of playing musical cars because they couldn't figure it out.  Fix your system!< /review>

<Text>Is anyone at Hertz qualified to use a phone? I have been at this all day trying to cancel my reservation. The website doesn't work, the local Temecula Hertz won't pick up the phone and the 800 number just keeps me on hold. I'm about to march down there and cancel in person. I would be amazed if someone working at Hertz could read this.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Everytime I call to either get a quote on a rental or to ask a question regarding my current rental the phone rings and rings sometimes up to 5 minutes at a time. Usually I get hung up on they'll pick up and hang up immediately (probably so the ringing stops) I even noticed this during my last visit, the phone continuously would ring and no body was in any rush to pick it up. It's rather annoying listening to a phone ring for a few minutes while you're waiting because no one will acknowledge you< /text><GmapID>0x80db7e02a0917865:0xc9f8e855ec44a3fd</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

October 2017 Update:  What a difference  12 months and a new manager will make.  Yesterday I had my first interaction with the new Branch Manager Luis.  Let's just say I have never been treated so rudely or belittled like I was with Luis from the moment I walked through the door to the moment he closwed the doors in my face.  Very rude and unprofessional.  Taking this up with corporate! As a Platinum Member, who received said status from renting so many cars from Hertz on a weekly basis, I am appalled by the events that transpired and am currently considering other rental agency options as I am that upset!!!!<//text>

Waited over an hour for a car. We are driving up to the airport so this means we are very pushed for time. Car wasn't ready and had to be cleaned. Expensive and they added on 40 dollars of insurance for just one day. Very bad experience.< /Review>

Not happy at all with Hertz Rent A Car in Temecula!!! - reserved a car on line for pick up st 8:00 a.m. On Friday and car was not available. We were than asked if we would like an upgrade at our expense?  Excuse me you do not have what I reserved ahead of time and now you want to charge me $25 more per day for what you do have! How was this our fault you did not have our car in stock???? Than you made us wait 1 1/2 hours for a car that fit our reservation. Tell me is this good customer service and would you return? Not a chance and we rent cars approximately monthly all over the U. S.< /Text>

<Text>Worst Customer Service ever!!! I called Hertz, in regarding a dispute with the other car insurance company and the days of coverage for a car rental. I called them many times, until I had someone to answer phone. However, I wanted to speak to Alice and he told me to hold for awhile. I was in hold for like 10 min. I just hung up ! I called again and they put me on auto-responded voicemail. Prior, I never heard of it before until ! Don't go to this car rental!! It's not worth your time and money!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

If I could rate negative I would! The level of disrespect and incompetence is outstanding!! They refused to rent me and my husband a car that's fine but not giving us our money back!? Not fine!! I have been on and off the phone with these people for three weeks and the last person I spoke to wouldn't let me speak to a manager and refused to even speak speak to me cause it's my husbands name on the rental!! I'm so fed up with this company I've dealt with nothing but rude people!!!!<//review>

<text>When we arrived at the car rental office they didn't have the car we ask for so we had to delay out trip for three hours until they got a larger car.  On our drive to Reno we kept getting alert messages on the car dash.  When we went to the Hertz office at the Reno airport they felt we needed to rent a different vehicle, which we did.< /text></record>

The adventure begins...well I have to say Hertz is consistent with excuses here just like San Diego.  I have a reservation waiting and the cars are ready when I get there nice and filthy and need OIL.  I am heading to the Bay area and I have to get oil for my rental...like I said they are consistent.  I want to say the agent was friendly and helpful....he was courteous.  He showed me a car so filthy I would not put my dog in it.  Carpets and seats were stained.  The second car showed them stains on seats..Unknown worker came out with 2 dirty cloths and wiped it down.  Their excuse; we only rent them and blamed it on the their local car wash service.  No worries Hertz...Enterprise gives customers dirty cars all the time.</text>

Don't bother making a reservation, it took almost 2 hours to pick the car up. We reserved a Chrysler 200 mid-size sedan. they delivered a Buick Verano small "luxury" sedan. When they finally brought it out it had not been washed. they said it had a full tank and it was barely over half full when I got in, and the windshield was cracked which I had not noticed until after I washed the car myself. They refused to compensate me for the wash. same story when I returned the car, two of the ladies in the lobby said they had been waiting for over two hours to pickup their cars after 30 minutes of waiting I put my keys on the agents desk and told her the car was in the parking lot, and to call me when they were able to get to it. They did not call back...< /text>

Scheduled pick up for nothing special a week before pickup. Showed up at 5 when we were scheduled to pick up the vehicle. They had No vehicles available when we arrived and had to call another Hertz to transfer one to this location, they told us it would be here in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later i asked how much longer it might be, they told us "Oh, just another 15 minutes more." I'm currently still waiting for the car to arrive at 5:35. Not the best start for our vacation weekend. And not to concerned about there customers. This review could change between now and my return, but these are my first impressions. So far i would not recommend this place to anyone.<//Text>

<Review>At the start of my experience I would have given them 5 stars.  I had been given the run around from 2 separate rental companies.  I called Hertz and they said come right down we have a car.  I got there and they had cars BUT it was double the competitors price.  At this point I needed a car so I agreed.  It was so fast and easy, I was thrilled.  BUT, they handed me keys and did not walk out with me to check the car or anything else.  The car was filthy dirty and I had to remove someone elses trash.  You would think that would have been done when it was returned.  Then I started it up and it was completely empty.  I went back in to tell them, and they just said thats fine just return it the same way.  I returned it the next day with 3/4 tank.  They did not give me any credit for that despite the sign on the wall that says they do.
I went back 2 days later as I needed a car for the weekend.  Same exact process but this time it had gas.  I called on Tuesday to say I needed it one more day and was told that if I didnt return it right then I would be paying triple the daily charge.  Why wasn't I told that up front?  No explanation given.  The manager did say that if I had it back by 3:00 he wouldn't charge me for that day, so at least he was trying.  Overall better than Budget or AVis, but they need to work on their customer service skills.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
I would never recommend this place to anyone as they can't even perform a simple task such as picking up the phone. I was trying to call to reschedule my rental and they just let the phone ring. Seems like they probably had trouble with the phone? No, absolutely not! Once I arrived after I called a bunch of different numbers to try and reschedule because I was running late. I attempted to call their phone which they completely ignored when it was within hands reach! I tried this out 3 times! And never did they try to answer the phone even when the other customers were gone.<//review>

They don't answer their phone when you need to speak with them.  Very disorganized location.  You will spend a lot of time in their office.  try Enterprise.< /text>

The car is well maintained but needs a little more care.

With Hertz Rent Membership, you will find a better program.

친절한 서비스와 예약 시스템이 잘 되어 있습니다.

차량은 잘 관리가 되어 있지만 조금 더 관리가 필요합니다.

<Text>Just a complete rip-off!!! I brought my vehicle in for a smog, they said it failed. When I went to pay for it they referred me to some ATS automotive. This is a test only location, so they are not allowed to make referrals as it can be a conflict of interest. I didn't go to the place they referred me too, and instead I went to Auto Express, a much better and much more honest mechanic that also does smog. I had him check out my car and he found nothing wrong with it. He ran emissions tests on it twice and told me that there should be no problem passing it. So I brought it back to AD smog because they had offered me $10 off a retest (even though the sign on the wall inside says the first retest is free) and it failed again. So I immediately brought it over to Auto Express and he had him smog it. It passed with flying colors. When I inquired what was going on, he told me that AD smog must be measuring emissions while the vehicle is cold, a practice that is not supposed to happen and often results in an unwarranted failed test. AD smog was able to get $110 out of me for smog tests and made an illegal referral to another business that I assume they are hoping will also benefit from this arrangement they have. Total scam here, don't bring your vehicle to dishonest people. I should not fail a test at one location, drive 3 blocks and then pass the test at another location. That tells me that there is something wrong with AD Smog. I passed 3 separate emissions tests with Auto Express, yet I failed both at AD Smog. Don't waste your money here or at their affiliate location ATS automotive! Deceptive and illegal practices!!!!< /Text>< rating>

Have been coming here for years with no problems.I have smogged multiple different vehicles.Always to the point and very quick.The smog technician is straight to the point.If your vehicle doesnt pass he does a great job at letting you know what the problem may be and how to deal with it.My overall experience here has been amazing.Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a routine shop.</review>

They're really nice and efficient. If your first smog check doesn't pass. Your second one is free; you just pay the DMV reporting fee.< /Review>

<Text>They are so nice!! Certified smog garages are really only distinguished by the quality of service, and this place is high quality!
I came from out of town to sell a car and needed it smogged (a requirement for selling in CA). Unfortunately, the FedEx nearby wouldn't print the sale documents I needed. The receptionist here printed it for me and made sure I knew all the rules for selling a car. Absolute sweetheart!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I’ve been going to this place for the last 8 years. Not anymore.

This place was great for a long time until recently the owner started to yell at customers and his employee.  The owner has a very bad temper and have NO customer service skills.

When I was there last time the owner was training a new employee. I feel so bad for the new employee. The owner almost made the new employee cry. Thats not the right way to treat people.

Also be careful with the pricing when they quoted you. It can changed daily. Dishonest dishonest dishonest.

I will NOT recommend this place.<//text>

I was helping a friend on this side of town and called around local smog stations. The price quoted here was significantly lower than others, which drew me in but also made me nervous. Usually you get what you pay for, but I left feeling the service was as least equal to the other guys, despite paying about half as much. I did wait about 10 or so minutes longer than I'm used to, but I also heard someone comment about how busy it was, so I'd probably chalk it up to that. Very satisfied overall and will definitely be recommending and returning.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

My go-to smog shop. I have taken multiple vehicles here and never have to wait long even if there are other people ahead of me. Very reasonable prices and if you have an issue passing smog they help you find the problem, how to fix it, and will run the test for you again. Highly recommended!<//review>

<text>I love this place!!!
Ignore the one negative reviewer. I have been coming here for years now. They are fast, polite, and efficient. My smog tests have always passed without any problems. The prices are reasonable as well.
They also have a nice waiting room to unwind in loaded with qualitity magazines, plenty of chairs and tables, a ceiling fan creating a cool breeze, and a water fountain to complete the relaxing atmosphere.
I always call ahead of time to see how busy they are to find the best time to go. I was just there, and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. This is my go-to spot... without question, I will definitely be back!<//text>< user_id>

They lied about the price to SMOG my vehicle. I called the day before and it was one of the better prices. When I got there the next day, it was significantly more expensive. Thanks for the waste of time!< /text>

<review>Avoid Ad Smog At All Costs! They Are Incompetent & Don't Know Emission Standards Or Laws! They Failed My Classic Chevy Truck On The Visual Test Because They Couldn't Find An EO Number On My Headers. I Told Them I Don't Need To Have An EO Number Because My Truck Doesn't Have A Catalytic Convertor & All The Smog Stuff Is Still Connected. They Rudely Said "They Never Heard Of That & We Are A Business & Don't Have Time To Look Up That Information!" I Had To Go To Another Smog Shop Which Said "Ad Smog Shouldn't Be In Business If They Didn't Know That Information!" I Wonder How Many Other Vehicles Ad Smog Failed That Should've Passed!< /review>< GmapID>

This shop is great and very convenient for those of us who work or live in mid-town.  Pate is an AMAZING tech.  When my van failed smog, he explained what the problem was in great detail.  When I "fixed" the issues as he described it I realized that the part that was given to me by the people at the O'Reilly store on Florin gave me the WRONG part.  When I went back to get it re-smogged, Pete stopped me and told me that the van would not pass smog if I tried it again with the part I replaced.  I the went to Napa auto and they gave me the right part.  Pete saved me $40.  Thank you Pete :)</Text>

The weekday manager is OK. But the weekend manager is so awful. He does not know how to properly schedule the inspection time. I came in at 9:30 am and he told me the estimated wait time is 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, he told me there is another 1 hr 30 minutes of wait time. After that, it is still not my turn. When I am done, it is already 1:15 pm. This is wasting people's time. Another thing that was really annoying is that the manager kept advertising his newly-opened Chinese restaurant to every customers who came to do SMOG. This is very un-professional.<//Text>

<Name>Bill Johnson</Name><text>Bill Kennedy, A Big Guy with a bigger heart !  We are fairly close in age and I have off and on been riding for many years. This is a first review for me and unsolicited by anyone. I am not into rating or judging people, But just had to comment on Bill, have been riding  with the exception of a Victory Motorcycle which are , or should be making Harley`s for the price sit up and take notice. Have been in Bill`s store many times and changed my mind and went for new bikes , metric`s mostly. Told Bill once sorry I have been in your store and never made a purchase, Bill`s first words were So what, just stop in anytime and we can just talk bikes. Started riding in the early 60`s , but each time I stop in I leave with a wealth of knowledge, Listen to Bill ! I taught safety for a major airline for 28 years, And was pretty good at it. Bill put`s things  in your head, that just may save your hide. A Great guy, and if you do purchase a used Harley he lists a true review of the bike from the ground up. Do yourself a favor, Stop by and check his inventory, He will tell you if your choice is right for you or to pass on it and pick another bike. Never ran up on a guy like him, he would rather loose a sale than sell you something that will get you in big trouble , Or Worse !
Thanks Bill for watching out for us. With the new video game drivers out there You are what we need to get home safe.
Bill J.
PS. Bill or his great staff had nothing to do with this lengthy review, His Big Heart  sharing knowledge, I just would not feel right,not giving him due credit.
BE SAFE !< /text></record>

<Review>Bill Kennedys shop  is a "mom & pop" bike shop. Family oriented, and friendly. Customers and homeless are both afforded respect. Many "custom" shops have come and gone in Oceanside, during the " Orange County Chopper" craze through the " "Sons of Anarchy" craze, Bill's shop crushed the competition with good quality used bikes, friendly advice, and excellent mechanic service, not to mention being a positive part of the community of Oceanside thru charity's and events.  They are the real deal, not a "chain store" of bikes.< /Review>< Pictures>

Bought my dyna here 2 years ago.  I shopped and looked for 2 years and Bill never pushed or tried to "sell" me anything...I would come in every week to check out new inventory and Bill would always say, "don't rush it, you'll find the one that fits you, bikes were like buses, another one will come along soon."  Go by and talk bikes with Bill and staff and support their events.  They'll do you right.</Review>

<Text>Any time I go there I get exactly what I need with out the pressure to buy something that I don't need. They treat their patrons like you would a friend they will joke around with you and have a normal conversation it's not just about sales. You can go there and share riding experiences. They also host toys for tots.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Washed it down with a iced coffee and I was in hog heaven.  Looked around a few times because I'm pretty sure I inhaled that sandwich because I was so hungry. I'll definitely be back for lunch or a quick afternoon coffee.  They will allow you to order ahead by phone.  I've done it a couple of times for coffee while I was on the road.< /Review>

When it comes to cozy vibes, this coffee shop nailed it. There are plenty of comfortable couches, chairs, and plants to be found in the room. The staves are lovely, and the mood is fantastic. The entire team was very welcoming and friendly. Their coffee is excellent and special. I strongly advise all coffee drinkers to visit this establishment.</review>

Tortas are really good and solid coffee!  Cubano with everything is a great choice!  Had that for lunch with an iced coffee. 👍👍👍  The Vanilla Latte is also really good.

If you're paying by card, you need to spend at least 5 dollars so fyi. I had to buy a cookie but I'm not complaining haha.  Who hasn't felt better after eating a cookie? It's science.<//Review>

I walk in. There’s a guy in there with no mask. Says he forgot it! I look over the counter and lady had mask on chin. Walked right out. I go in there to help a local shop but not worth risking myself or family over negligence!< /Review>

This is probably the worst quality food and customer service I have ever experienced. The old lady who owns the shop refused to remake my smoothie because she was stuck on the difference of whether I ordered a smoothie or Energy smoothie. It's literally the same thing.

I ordered a banana and peanut butter smoothie, and when I got it it tasted like a macchiato. And I simply I want a peanut butter smoothie not coffee. And the young lady who took the order apologized and said the owner rather give you your money back. Which I then said, "can't you just remake it ?" And she said yes, then came back and said the owner would rather give you your money back.

And I said okay...and she still didn't want to give me my money back.

I've been coming here for 10+ years, and I should have noticed with all the differences, that it's owned by someone completely new.

This old lady raised the prices, doesn't speak English, and insists that the customer is wrong if you question the quality of food or if the order is correct.

I can't believe she was arguing back and forth with me in front of her employee with other customers in line.
She obviously doesn't care about her customers or the quality of her food.

Save yourself a walk on this block and avoid her cafe at all costs.< /text>

The Air Conditioning System was completely shut off. For a place that dabbles in coffee and food, I would consider this rather unhealthy. They need to fix this ASAP. It was boiling hot in there.< /Review>

We were the only ones there and it took forever to get our drinks which we ended up throwing away after one gulp because of how watery and flavorless they were. I guess the good ratings are based on previous management? Make sure you're trying your product before handing it out to customers so you know what you're serving. We wasted money on this place and ended up going to Starbucks instead.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cf7b612d080d:0xe424922d6cfd367f</Gmap_id></record>

They took her order and I was waiting patiently for my turn. I was actually next.  After,  standing there for about 15 min. They never acknowledge me nor took my order. I just walked out.  As I was leaving they still didn't acknowledge me or cared.  All , I wanted was a fruit cup the have in their cooler.

< Review>
This place looks nice and all but theyre so damn expensive. Their smoothies are about 7 dollars each but if you want it with protein or to substitute a milk it goes up. So imagine, you order 2 smoothies and it comes out to around 20 dollars??? No thanks. They also have roaches, and not the little ones, theyre big and nasty. Wouldnt recommened. Youre way better off going to starbucks or mcdonalds for your drinks. And if youre looking for a delicious torta that doesnt have Microwaved meat go to the Gallo Hiro.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I asked for a bionic boy. Horrible, he barely had cream, he put watermelon pineapple on it! The bionics don't carry that fruit and I didn't even have a banana ... when I was going to pay I thought it was 6.25 because that's what it said on the poster. And the lady charged me 8.50 for a bionic boy, she said those were old prices that haven't changed yet. It would have been worth the 8.50 if the bionic had been delicious but it was the worst bionic I've ever had. I had to throw it out, I couldn't even finish eating. 🤮

(Original)
Pedi un bionico chico. Horrible apenas si tenia crema, le puso piña sandia! Los bionicos no llevan esa fruta y ni platano tenia... cuando hiba a pagar pense que era 6.25 porque asi decia en el cartelon. Y la senora me cobro 8.50 por un bionico chico dijo que esos eran precios viejos que aun no los cambian. Hubiera valido la pena los 8.50 si el bionico hubiera estado delicioso pero fue el peor bionico que eh probado. Tuve que tirarlo, ni siquiera pude terminar de comer. 🤮< /Review>

Save Mart (Oakdale Ca.)
This is my favorite, clean, well stocked plenty of up front parking. Vegetables and fruits always fresh. Meats well packaged and marked easy to see. Bakery delightful. Clerks always nice and informable  Masks required.<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Generally reserve shopping at up scale food supply like Save Mart, for special occasions as income  has been impacted by the quarantine.
Going to a real meat counter reminds me how meat is supposed to be, same with seafood... Unfortunately my last splurge  on lobster an larger shrimp wasn't as inspired as I have  become pleased  with the quality SM
Maintains.  ½ of a 65$  meal had to be thrown out , I  am not refusing it very well could have been my preperation but at 60 years old this ain't my 1st fishing trip! haha
Management probably would have replaced or refunded the price but couldn't bring myself to complain if guilt wasn't clear.  Generally a terrific store in my opinion</text>< Date>

I needed a bathroom break and due to COVID-19 all gas station bathrooms are closed as are fast food ones.  So we stopped here to use the bathroom.  It was VERY clean!  THANK YOU for letting us stop in for a 'break'.
Also - the fried chicken smelled SOOOO GOOOOOOD!  In gratitude, we ordered chicken tenders and some spring slaw - DELISH!  Again, thanks for the great spur of the moment, surprise break and snack!  YUM!</text></record></dataset><record>

Gal working register 4 at 10:00 am 06-22-20 needs to learn to do her job better. She tossed my fruit almost throwing it at the bagger. She also combined my transaction with my fiancee when there was clearly a divide. Resulting in one card being charged for the entire transaction. I send a lot of money here.this was not okay.</Review>

<text>Store is very well kept. All staff I've come in contact with are very nice. Aisles are neat and organized. They have a small floral section. Bakery with a variety of goodies. Fruit stand to squeeze your own fresh juice. Fruit, specialty waters, and vegetables all packaged cut up ready to go. Build a sandwich spot. Meat counter spotless with sea food... I'm a happy customer .<//text>< pics>

What is the deal with your stores ? Between the Oakdale location and the bigger store down the street from Ace we spend upwards of 800 $ a month, and close to each and every time we shop at these locations the overwhelming majority of the young checkers DO NOT say hello, or thank you at the end of each transaction. What ever happened to that procedure ? Never have this experience at Raley's in Oakdale and plan on shifting all our business in that direction for lower prices and as a matter of principle. Thank You Save Mart Management.<//Review>

I love this location.The store is so nice and clean everytime I go there.They always have whatever Im looking for.While I was there a young lady named melissa helped me out and went above and beyond to helo me find what I was looking for.Along the time spent helping me find what I was looking for I discovered she was pregnant and she was helping me to this extent with such a great attitude I was baffled.2 thumbs up to this young lady.10/10 would shop again.</review>

I love the remodeled store! Juice bar, taco/nacho/burrito bar, improved deli, and of course the grill to order! They will cook anything in the meat department you bring them while you shop. Pick up a fresh made dinner and grocery shop at the same time! Or even call in your order and they'll have it ready at a specified time. Convenience, delicious meals, and variety all in one place.</Text>

Great store with friendly, and actually helpful service.  From organic produce to a free grill to order service;  custom made guacamole to a fresh bakery; not to mention a wide selection.  Awesome!< /text>

< Review>
This Save Mart has great customer service and great selections of food. And the store is always clean.And in the meat area they will even cook your food on a grill it for you and cut meats for you.And have lots of fruits and veggies and even serve hot food and have delicious cakes and baked goods. I always get birthday cakes from them. But stuff can be very expensive but that is just Save Mart they are always somewhat pricy<//Review>

This store has the in store grill that you can take fresh meat over to and they will cook it right there on the spot. Or you can call ahead and they will have it ready for you to pick up and take home. Great for the days when you want really good food but don't want to go to a restaurant.</review>< rate>

This store discriminated against me because of the way that I look! I would give this place zero stars if I could. The way I was treated was unbelievable. My wife wasn’t feeling well so she sent me in for her to grab a steak for dinner. I walked up to the meat, looked around, and realized I wasn’t sure which cut or type of steak she wanted. So I figured I would just walk back out to the car, which was about 100 feet outside the front door in plain sight and my wife sitting in it with the window down. I walked up to her and asked which steak I should get and she told me, so I went back into the store, walked straight back to where I had just been standing looking at the meats, I grabbed a steak and walked to the check out counter. As I’m setting my stuff down, a fellow customer accused me of stealing something when I first walked into the store. He said that I walked out without paying for anything when I went to ask my wife what to get and that he KNEW that I stole something. I was so offended, that I just told him to have the store check their cameras. But he kept on and on about how his father owned a grocery store and he knows how much theft hurts everyone, still accusing me of stealing AS IM PAYING FOR MY ITEM. I payed and turned to leave as this man keeps at it, asking the cashier if they’re just going to “let me leave.” The cashier looked at him and rudely said “well there’s nothing we can do about it.” I was flabbergasted. These people were all profiling me because of how I look!! My wife and I deal with this often because we are skinny, have missing teeth and tattoos. People have the audicity to treat us like we are drug addicts and they just get away with it. So here I am writing a review because I feel that this is the only way I can voice my concerns. I am a top google contributor and am responsible for reviewing businesses on a daily basis. I’ve never had to write a review quite like this before. I will be posting this review on yelp as well.</Text>

I’ve shopped here several times since the remodel and am very dissatisfied with the service and pricing. Service behind the counter has been slow. Ive never been so lost in store layout. The store organization is very difficult to navigate.<//Text>

The remodel has definitely given this location the upper hand in town. There are still a couple premium items I have to go to Raley's for but otherwise this is now my preferred place to shop.<//text>

Noticeable difference in price and selection between this Oakdale store and the nearest store 12 miles away in Riverbank. Oakdale being the higher price with less selection. I'm still a fan of Save Mart but I prefer the Riverbank store.<//Text>
