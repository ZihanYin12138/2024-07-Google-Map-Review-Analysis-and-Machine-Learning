Good clean place for lunch. Free soup and egg rolls. Food my lunch plate black bean prawns is good value and tasted really good. Sauce is not saucy, well seasoned and good size for the shrimp. Veggies are fresh and crunchy.</review>

One of the bests Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area. Their food is always fresh, delicious and prepared fast!

The workers here are always pleasant and accommodating. We really appreciate you staying open during these trying times …

You must give them a try!</review>

We ordered take out and when picking up the food, we saw the cook drop zucchini on the floor to then put it back on the prep area and proceed to chop it. This obviously didn't inspire us great trust but we still gave it a try. Everything we ordered tasted awful: the breading on the sweat and sour pork was super thick and the meat itself really fatty. Potstickers were also a huge let down by being mostly dough and little filling. The vegetable chow main was ok.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Little China has been around for while but I just discovered it. A small neighborhood place, not much to look at but they provides consistently good Chinese food. In good time and reasonably priced. It was recommended to me when I wanted a good wor won ton soup and they did not disappoint. It had a lovely clear broth filled with won tons, chicken breast, beef, shrimp and bok choy. I've been going back about once a week ever since.</Text>< user_id>

Jin Ye, formerly known as Little China is a great neighborhood spot. They've always delivered fantastic Chinese food, but with their recent remodel they now also deliver great ambiance.

The place is looking better than ever and the Chinese food is like comfort food. Highly recommend.<//text>

This is my "go to" place for Chinese food!   Love the Hot & Sour soup (we always order a large so we can take home the leftover).  We've always found the food to be fresh and delicious.   I was really bummed that Little China closed for remodeling (though it really needed it), but the wait was worth it as the restaurant was transformed into a beautiful space, now Jin Ye.< /review>

Do not order online (thru grubhub or anything else) your order will be ignored. It took a full hour to receive my food while walk-in and called-in orders were being fulfilled immediately. The food was good, but not worth the wait.< /review>

<rate>2<//rate><text>The food is good but tonight the service was completely unacceptable. They piece mealed food to our table.  We finished our soup, ended up having twice as much soup as normal waiting for the main courses.
They brought one and then 30 minutes later I went to cancel the rest of the order since it seemed they had forgotten us .  They said we should have ordered it all together. Thought we had!  We have eaten here multiple times, never had this happen.  We felt they made their poor service our fault.   Since it seems they did have the rest of our meal ready, we took it to go home.  By the way we ordered hot Saki, it never did show up.  Not really planning to eat here again.  Also, restaurant was NOT crowded and I saw only one take-out while we were there.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

It's fresh, friendly, inexpensive. The lunch specials during weekdays  are a great tasty deal. There is sugar in many of the sauces,  if you don't mind that, then perfect.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>This review is a long time coming. I discovered this place about 4 years ago. When I first found it, I actually  enjoyed it very much. I thought it was a step up from some of the other near by small chinese spots in richmond. I used to always think the food was better then the atmosphere and that if they renovated it would really be a decent place to have lunch of dinner...
The service has always been less then desired. Feeling rushed to get in and get out..
Then maybe 4 or 5 months ago they did renovate and it looks great! Inside is a much better feel but unfortunately maybe they are now lacking on their most important part.. The food!... Today my boyfriend and I called in a pick up order (which I highly suggest around lunch if your picking up because they get busy...anyways, when he came home with the food it was almost inedible and half way through, I found a big black hair in my chow fun... Which tasted gross anyways... It was way overcooked and tasted like mush.... And my fried rice was UNDERCOOKED.... This was a disaster and I will not be returning... Expect maybe to ask for a refund for today's lunch! A few hours later I got super sick and threw up and had to leave work so that really ruined my day and I lost hours.. 100% sure I got food poisoning from here today! Disaponted here for the last time! Not to mention my bf and I are professional chefs haha jokes on us! We should have stayed home and cooked.... consequences of being lazy!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I got the Hunan Salmon which is a house special, it was really good. They first serve you a little pot of tea and a couple fried wonton chips to start. Then you get your entree which was big enough for two servings. It's kind of slow when busy, but the food is good.</Review>

Very disappointing considering the fairly good reviews.  Good was ok but the place is absolutely filthy.  Big dust Cobwebs on the walls, dirty coated ceiling fans.  Generally dirty everything.  I am disgusted thinking I just ate there.<//text>

No msg but yes, chicken breast. Chow mein is flavorful without being too greasy. Small cramped restaurant and so I prefer to take food to go. Fast service and almost always get my Togo items just right.</Text>

Came into the place twice food was pretty good but the service was very bad not good customer service all they worried about is taking my money they lost my receipt and took my credit card and had to print out another one before they let me take my food when I'm standing right there at the counter don't think I'm coming back again< /Review>

Closed to cars now just a walk and bike bridge. New car bridge right next to it. Great sunset views of the river and Mtns to the west. Also connects the Sacramento River trail.< /review>< Pictures>

A beautiful historic landmark. Lots of foot traffic and bicycles. Great place for photography. Also a good place to watch fireworks from on Fourth of July, but very crowded.<//review>

The diesel horse Bridge construction was started on 1914 and is one of the oldest Bridges intended for cars .
this bridge has been in service
for a very long time.
Now it's part of the Sacramento River Trail for bicyclists skateboarders and Walkers alike.
this bridge was retired in 1997 with a modern bridge.
but this Old Bridge was kept on the side as part of the historic landmarks in the area.
So if you want to go cruise around on the Sacramento River Trail take in the sites that Redding has to offer and see a little bit of History.
check out the diesel horse Bridge.<//Text>

I had 5 watches that all needed batteries replaced and 2 needed completely new wristbands. ($102) While I couldn’t find a exact replica of the previous metallic band, they were able to suggest several alternatives that still fit the size and style of my watch. I was happy with the relatively quick (about an hour) and friendly service of the young lady and will definitely be back again.< /Text>

I went in to get my watch arm band replaced and for $16, the least that I should have expected was to have gotten something that holds together longer. The loop that holds the strap down came apart as soon as I got it back home. Well, I guess the most I can expect is that they can only replace batteries without issue. You truly get what you pay for. Truer words have never been spoken</text>

<Review>I'm always so satisfied when I take my watch to Fast-Fix. I bought a lifetime battery warranty 8 years ago and they were happy to honor it and also put in a new screw on my band for free. I also took another watch in thinking I had to buy a new watch band and to my surprise they were able to fix it so of course I bought a warranty for that watch too.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. I had recently purchased  a G-Shock watch, except the band was too big. I checked in to Fast Fix to have my watch adjusted to my wrist. Their clerk had me try on my watch to get an idea as to how many links they needed to remove. Their clerk told me that the adjustment would take roughly 20-25 minutes. I figured I'd kill some time at Macy's. Not even 10 minutes after I left the store, I receive a phone call from the Fast Fix staff, telling me that my watch is ready. I checked back in, and another employee had me try it on. Sure enough, my watch was now a perfect fit. The fair pricing and the great staff definitely earned my business!</Text>

<review>Replaced a battery on a piece last year at this business. Needed another battery replacement this year and decided to try another local watch repair shop. Come to find out, the previous battery that was installed was clearly the wrong size. The horologist changing the replacement couldn't believe it, it was almost half the size of the required cell for the watch.

Terrible business practices that I hope the public is aware of when entering your store. Yikes.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I had just lost a small side diamond on my ring. I went in to zales to see if they could replace it and repair the prongs. I was given an estimate of a 3 week turn around. Heck no! So I was referred to fast fix and thank goodness for them. I went in at around noon. They said that it could be done by 5 as long as they had the diamond in stock. They cleaned, rhodium plated, tightened the other prongs, and replaced my diamond. I received the call at 4 that it was ready. Amazing! So friendly, so helpful, and so quick. Will definitely come back to them and recommend them.<//Text>< Rating>

They can fix any type of jewelry and I've even come to them multiple times for the same piece! Even though I did not buy my original rope chain from them, the staff was very knowledgeable and offered to explain why my chain kept breaking and possible options. They are so friendly and patient. They get the job done, call you when it's ready, get the repairs done in realistic and adequate time, they are honest, and have great prices. Fast-Fix Jewelry also works with you to get you an affordable price for any item and is not forceful or tries to make a sale. I won't go to anyone else for all my jewelry repairs! They log all your fixes and know what's been done to each piece. Most trustworthy business!<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>Very easy transaction, went in for a battery change. I have a Nixon 51-30 so the backing needs a special tool to take off to replace. It only took 10-15 min and they gave my watch a steam cleaning which made it look brand new! Will definitely go back for more repairs and if I need another battery...<//text>< pics>

Awesome fast friendly service! I had a local jeweler quote me a higher price and a 2 WEEK WAIT and laughed when I said I wanted to find somewhere faster thinking I wouldn't be able to. Well I can always find a reason to fo go to the mall and ate at lazy dog and my bracelet was fixed for 10 dollars less in the time it took me to eat dinner. They have some beautiful jewelry in there too!<//review>

They are very nice and will do little fixes quick. They also explained what was wrong with my watch I’m a clear manner. They replaced a battery in one of my watches very fast (about 10 minutes).</review>

< Review>
I always bring my jewelry to be fixed here and I am never disappointed.
Recently I took in a ring my grandmother gave me to be resized and polish, I wish I took a before and after. The ring was old and dingy, not really shiny and when they were done it looked like a brand new ring. I almost cried at how beautiful they left it. Thank you, fast fix!< /Review>

I always go to Fast-Fix Years ago I went to another place for a new battery and they told me I needed to have my watch cleaned $100 I left & found Fast-Fix All I needed was a new battery Fast-Fix never cheats you They replace batteries for free when they are still under warranty I brag about Fast-Fix so much  that my friends give me their watches to take to Fast-Fix I also trust them with my wedding rings< /text>

I dropped my watch off last week. At first they tell me it would take 3 hours to fix the band on my watch. Upon my return they tell me it's going to be another week because they need to order the part. A week later they tell me that the person who was going to fix my watch is on vacation and it would be another week. People do not bring your watches to be repaired here. They don't keep there word and won't care about your feelings or good customer service.</text>

Fast-Fix Jewelry is the best place to buy/repair your jewelry. I've been going to this place for over 10 years. The staff welcomes you and they are very friendly. Mr. Masood Ghassemi goes out of his way to help you.. I will never go to another jeweler so long as Mr. Masood is around.< /Review>

<Text>Fast Fix is a rip off. I purchased a diamond ring. I have a receipt stating the ring is 14 kt. gold and diamonds. The owner kept the ring to supposedly polish and clean the ring. I made a statement to him “ok don’t change my diamonds”. Funny how you say things at that moment. Went back ring not ready. Got a call from the owner stating he made a mistake. The ring had sapphire diamonds. Huh? When I went to pick up the ring it didn’t look right. Took the ring to another jeweler and it seemed to have been tampered with. The jeweler stated the stones were a very low cloudy grade of cubic zirconias. Yes, you can see the ring lines are crooked, and dents where they hammered the gold. He totally lied to me. I was so excited about this ring and now I am sad I ended up with no ring. Do not trust this man he might not be giving you what you are paying for!!! I wish I knew how to post the pictures of the receipt and ring. You would be able to see that I am stating the facts!!!!</Text>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1526772682264, 'text': 'To be clear on this experience, Ms. Mona Diaz was COMPLETELY WRONG. She was going to purchase this particular ring in Jan. 2018. Yes the ring was LABELED 14K Y/G Dia. Ring for the original price of $1200 (The deposit receipt on the picture was based on wrong label) Price was brought down to $900. Ms. Diaz made a deposit of $450 at that time and was to pay the rest later. Ring was left here to be polished. Unfortunately, our jeweler  who has been with us for over 20yrs, noticed it was MISLABELED. Stones were not diamonds but were CZs. We immediately called Ms. Diaz to inform her that the ring had been MISLABELED. I Masood Ghassemi Owner, left her multiple messages, spoke Ms. Diaz multiple times that she did not have to purchase the ring if she was unhappy. We offered complete refund on her deposit. Ms. Diaz insisted she loved the ring and would still like to purchase ring as CZs. Price for ring was appropriately Priced at $300. After several weeks as shown on receipt Ms. Diaz Purchased a 14k Y/G Cz Ring on 4/24/2018 for $300 and received a $150 refund from previous deposit.\nOne week later Ms. Diaz came back and wanted a full refund because she insisted that we " Switched " all stones in ring. We gave her full refund. AS BEING IN THIS BUSINESS FOR 23YRS IN THIS MALL IT WOULD  NOT MAKE ALL SENSE AT ALL FOR US TO TRY TO REMOVE ALL DIAMONDS. In the process of removing all stones from a channel setting, Diamonds as such, would all break and/or chip. Plus resetting CZs into it would cost us a lot of time and money. "Diamonds" removed would be USELESS to us. We did not hammer, modify, or touch the stones. It was the same exact ring we originally showed in January.\nI tried to explain to Ms. Diaz multiple times. We try to do the most honest thing by our customers every single day.\nWE DID NOT SELL HER A DIAMOND RING. WE SOLD HER A 14K Y/G RING W/ CZs RING FOR $300. IT WAS A SIMPLE MISTAKE ON A LABEL THAT WE QUICKLY CORRECTED. Ms. Diaz received a complete refund for $300 after this 4 month ordeal.'}<//response><GmapID>0x80c2d7d121e80589:0x3f8163ce13f90b6b<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Well first of all, this place is horrendous because the whole purpose of their business is to repair, and they didn't repair crap. They left my glasses broken as it is. My boyfriend went to this place in hopes of fixing my favorite glasses, on top of that paying almost 100$ for it. He waited over an hour for this. I don't even want to add anything else.< /Review>

We had a leaking tire on Sunday morning, memorial day weekend.  Oscar saved us! Fixed the stem and check all the tires had the right pressure. He was fast and honest. I would highly recommend any stranded traveler stop in and give them your business.<//Review>

Great people at Ken's is an understatement these people are truly understanding and empathetic. They dropped what they where doing to help, not to mention the discount. They extracted 2 of my vehicles.</Review>

They had Immediately began working on the repair and had dropped everything they were doing to provide a very speedy service.

<rating>5<//rating><name>Carlos Campos< /name><Review>Pros: Came in with a leaky tire that a company in Vegas couldn't find the source of.  Went in with the intention of replacing the tire.  After hours guys took the time to check for anything and found a leak in the stem.  Saved me quite the amount of money.  Good people all around!  Would definitely recommend.
Cons: if you require help after hours there is a mandatory after hours fee.  It is not absorbed into the work quote. Be prepared for that.  I think they're worth it.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>We were stranded in the middle of the Mojave Desert when our car broke down. Antonio from Kens Towing picked us up promptly and was so kind. It was just myself, along with my three kids, and the experience was very hard for all of us. Antonio was very kind and great with my boys. He wore a mask the entire time, which ended up being hours. You never know what will happen when you have an emergency during during travel, but I am very grateful that something so hard was made a bit easier by someone great! I would absolutely recommend Kens Towing.</Text>< pics>

My bf and I were headed back to Vegas when the tire pressure light came on!!! In the desert is the last place I wanted to get stranded so I looked up the closest tire shops and there it was 24 hrs. We pulled up and it took every bit of 5 mins to plug the tire and be on our way and OH!!!! AFFORDABLE!!!!!!!!!< /review>

Thank you Ken’s Towing. We were driving to California with our travel trailer, we noticed one of the tires began getting bald very quickly. We have AAA with rv service so we called them to see if they could swap out the tire with our spare (we were in North Vegas at the time) AAA said it would be an hour then called back and said they had no one that would be able to service us with the trailer and those that could would be 4 hours to find a place and then submit for a reimbursement consideration. After trying a few shops in Vegas that wanted us to wait 90 mins and charge us 50 bucks we found Kens Towing in Baker they helped us out immediately and charged a much more reasonable price to swap the tire. Thanks so much.<//Text>

<Review>I called for help around 3am, as I was on the side of the road needed help getting out of a ditch. Called Ken's towing, unfortunately they couldn't help me. All they said was "all our drivers are busy"
I asked when would one be free next, they followed up with "our drivers are busy". Then they hung up. Why answer at that point.< /Review><date>1605004566225< /date>< pics>

So my car broke down after a flat about 10 miles outside baker around 10.30 pm. I called around, kens towing gave me the best price. David the truck operator showed up early, took care of me and my car. Got home with good timing. Clean truck, clean driver, great service.< /review>

It's no fun to have a flat in the desert when the summer temperature is 109°! Even though I have BMW Assist and run flat tires, BMW would only tow me back to Las Vegas and make me spend the night until the service department opened on Monday. Unfortunately, no one in Baker carried the tire I needed, but SUPER helpful Oscar at Ken's was able to put a tire on my car that got me home where I could buy a proper tire. He literally saved the day! The tire was on in less than 15 minutes and cost under $40. Thank you, Oscar!!!! You saved the day.😊<//text>

These guys were amazing! They were quick to get to me.  David the driver was just amazing!  And went above and beyond my expectations, and even taught me a few things to help if I ever have trouble again. Great customer service they really care there! Thank you for being there to help!</Review>

While my encounter with David was unpleasant, Leslie was very courteous and understanding. I truly appreciated her diplomacy. Antonio, the replacement driver, respected my vehicle, and was amazing! I had a wonderful time chatting with him and he really helped to alleviate the incredibly stressful time I had had being stuck on the freeway for about 13 hours, yes on the 13th! I'm not superstitious, but that was interesting. I would recommend Leslie for dispatch, and Antonio for driving hands down!</Text>

<Review>I want to thank Ken's towing and tire service for their service. Yes it is expensive but since Our RV tire blew out in the middle of nowhere. Instead of waiting AAA's 6 hrs towing they They saved us for the night, waiting for less than 2 hrs. Staff Vanessa was very helpful. The guys oscar and Marco changed our tire. Again, thank you.< /Review>< Time>

I believe this place doesn’t ever deserve one star .

Please TRY TO AVIOD them .
I understand when it’s comes to business and you have to follow your policy . But once you say something , you can’t just change it up .

They do try to prey off you , especially if your not from town .
All the employees need too work on communication & professionalism and maturity !

If you end up having to deal with them , please ask all kinds of questions such as fee’s and all . They tell you one price then come up with another’ after .< /Text>

<Time>1500948182055< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Completely dishonest company who preys on stranded motorists by using deceptive scare tactics and false claims

My car was overheating about 20 miles outside of Baker and roadside service sent out Ken's towing.

A guy named David showed up and in less than 30 seconds, I had already caught him in his first of many lies.

He tried to manipulate, cheat and lie his way to convince me to pay $550 for a tow, even though I insisted that the vehicle just needed coolant which he didn't have. When I called roadside assistance, I specifically asked them to have the driver bring coolant, a message that David claimed to never receive.

In less than 2 minutes, in the dark, David was able to diagnose my vehicles as having a blown head gasket, and explained that I had no other alternative than to tow it. He gave me a list of completely bogus reasons why he knew the head gasket was blown. He must have just assumed that I was some dumb motorist with no basic knowledge of cars who he could easily take advantage of. He clearly didn't realize that I have worked at a car dealership for the past 12 years.

I persisted that I believed the vehicle just needed coolant and and he continued to come up with false arguments for his cause.

He lied repeatedly and used manipulation, threats, guilt and scare tactics to try to get me to agree to let him tow.

At first, he wouldn't even tell me a price to be towed. I had to ask him three separate times before he actually asked me how much I was willing to pay? Don't most tow companies either have a flat rate or charge by the mile?

Finally he blurted out $550.  I told him politely that I was not going to pay 550 for him to tow me and that I was going to call people in Vegas and that his services were no longer needed.

When he finally realized that I wasn't going to submit to his misleading tactics, he suddenly remembered that he had water on his truck that we could fill the radiator with. Amazing that this hadn't been an option for the last 30 minutes.

He agreed to fill me up with water for the price of $110, and he told me that "when you break down again, I'm not going to come save you".

After I left David, I drove 460 miles straight at 70 mph with my a/c on full blast and I never had another problem the rest of the way. In fact, the temperature gauge didn't get past the halfway point the entire rest of my trip. Not too shabby for having a blown head gasket.

I assume that most people he encounters just fall for his scam and his dishonesty, but I wasn't about to. It got to be so bad that even my wife realized what he was trying to do and started video and audio recording him.

I will be filing complaints with the roadside service company that I called as well as the state and the better business bureau.

I believe that all businesses need to make money and they need to be paid for their services, but I don't believe that any business should ever take advantage of stranded motorists by deceiving them with false claims in an attempt to trick them into gouging for services that they don't need. Shame on David and shame on Ken's towing.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Our work Truck had a bad alternator out in the middle of nowhere California, Kelso around 11:30 at night. The dispatcher said they would meet us at the Kelso Depot with a tow truck in the morning and they never showed up. When I called they apologized but that doesn't cut it when people need your help. When we finally got the truck to the shop, they knew it was a bad alternator, we left the shop to head to Barstow and they called us 30 minutes later saying they couldn't fix the alternator and wanted us to come back and pick up the truck. Basically, they didn't tow the truck for us and then they couldn't even fix the problem when we got the truck to them. Very frustrating.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1498248113606</Time><rating>1</rating><Review>This is the most horrible road service I ha e ever came I  contact with. Called in for a tire on my semi at 9 am, they told me they wouldn't be here until 2.5 hours later, I'm down the road from them. So I wait it out and the guy never showed up. I call again and the receptionist is so unprofessional she does not know prices, hangs up on me a couple times. They are the only place that work on semi tires in baker ca. So naturally I keep calling until I get the info that I need. So for a 12 mile service call they are charging almost 700 dollars and on top of that they are late. I hope someone decides to open another shop here soon. This is ridiculous</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Wasted over an hour of my time just because they couldn't communicate what tires they had in stock.</Review>

Took 2 hours to fix my blowout, and i am only 1.3 miles away from them. I guess they charge my company the moment they get the phone call, because they told my dispatch they would be here in 45 mins... 2 hrs later the guy shows up</review>

Eddie's has a limited menu compared to other Mexican restaurants, but they only offer what they can cook exceptionally well. The food is consistently good, especially the deep fried foods (chimichangas, flautas, etc.). The food is never greasy, it always tastes fresh.<//text>

Awesome coin laundry for everyone. Can sodas are always 75 cents. Some places I been to. They charge over 1 Dollar for a can of soda. Laundry is always neat and clean. Laundry wash prices are reasonable. I have no issues from using this laundry. Love the staff.<//text>

Clean facility, VERY few problems with any of the machines or dispensers. Plenty of folding tables even in these times of social distancing. Laundry gotta be but this is a great place to get it done. Highly recommended</Review>

<text>I grew up in Santa Clarita in the late 90's and early 2000's. I visited this laundromat several times and I was always please to see the owner, Mr. Kato, taking excellent care of the facility and his customers. Several times he gave me quarters "just because" and that made me feel valued as a customer.
I now own Dog Gone Good hot dog cart in Groveland CA and I recently bought a car wash too! Groveland Ca. is the northern gateway to Yosemite National Park and we have many international tourists pass through. I take pride in treating my customers as he treated me back in the day. He inspired me to be an entrepreneur so many years ago and I've always wanted to thank him. I hope to return one day and thank him in person while shaking his hand. Many thanks kind Sir!</text><user_id>110636691705036800251</user_id><gmapID>0x80c2888b5f21ff59:0xaea0e161539b9451<//gmapID><resp>{'time': 1624076388514, 'text': 'Way to go Matthew!

<Text>I've been coming here for years and it's such a well kept up place with probably the lowest prices in Canyon Country. I know the owners by name and other staff who work there. They are so kind and helpful. When mr. Kato  is around he usually gives my kids a few quarters and he gives a few quarters to every person who is there as a way of showing his gratitude. I do a lot of towel laundry for my salon and this place is always given me a good cleaning for my money. It does get busy on Friday nights and Saturday mornings. I try to come in the afternoons earlier to beat the crowd.< /Text>< pictures>

We went here to get an international health certificate for our pet. They are very organized and super kind. They asked me to send them details before hand so that they could have all the details on their side. I was out of the country and my friend was taking my pet and co-ordinating this was so easy while in the contrary you would think it would be complicated given that I was not there in person They needed to do an electronic international health certificate and they even went the extra mile to give us the confirmation number, contact USDA to ensure everything went smoothly. Alex was constantly in touch and sent me several emails, voicemails and always got back to me. We truly appreciate everything they did to help us get our pup back home ❤️< /Review>

We just switched to this vet and so far we are very happy. Our dog had her annual exam here and they were very thorough and thoughtful at the appointment. We were able to get an appointment quickly and also follow up vet tech appointments. They have flea collars and medications available at the same price as available online. It was so nice to be at a vet where you get personal attention. It’s also a convenient location with easy parking.</review>

Dr. Sandy Hazanow is deeply thoughtful, present, and available in her practice. Her love and respect for the animals and humans she serves, as well as the joy she has for her work is apparent. I have had many difficult choices to make for the animals in my family, including end of life care, and have  especially appreciated Dr. Hazanow's ability to offer advice, informed options, and heartfelt guidance without shame, pressure, or false urgency. I have always felt authentically heard and supported by her, welcomed to ask questions and take my time, and impressed by her willingness to go above and beyond. It is rare to find a veterinary practice that so fully meets the needs of both myself and my animals, and I fully trust my animals in Dr. Hazanow's care.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I took my cat to Dr. Whitaker about an allergy. He was absolutely amazing. He spend time answering my questions and laid out a staged treatment approach with Plan A and Plan B. The front desk staff and clinic are also very welcoming.

I had previously been to another vet (in the Mission) that didn't seem as clean. At this other vet, the exam rooms were loud (with dogs pacing outside) and my cat was on edge the entire time. Sever Hills was the exact opposite.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

OMG! I would NEVER take my pet (cat) here. I went to the office for a simple food purchase. BIG mistake! They don't know how to use their computer system for billing.The front desk person is clueless. (I'll cut her some slack because she was probably new.) The person in charge was equally clueless...and THAT'S not OK. It required bank intervention. My cat is not a patient at this practice and never will be. If this is how the front office works imagine how bad things would be if/when you pass through to the back office. (Clinical Care Area) And that's where the bank cannot intervene. Scary place.< /text>

<Review>The vets were knowledgeable and very thorough in their examination of some skin sores my cat had. They provided me with an estimate and explained the tests they recommended. The prices seemed reasonable, especially when compared to other vets in San Francisco. The staff, both in the front and the techs and vets, were very nice, and everyone handled my cat very well. I would recommend them to my friends and definitely expect to return.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

However, if you are more interested in making your animal immediately comfortable and not spending a lot of money on diagnostics to discover the root cause of these problems, you may find yourself fighting a bit of an uphill battle.<//Text>< UserId.>

I can't say enough great things about Seven Hills and their Veterinarians. You can tell that they love animals and want to keep them healthy and happy. I was really worried when I moved to SF with my 15 year old cat that was sick with cancer, but after going to Seven Hills I was so glad that I did move to SF, they really helped with his care and keeping him comfortable. And when it was time for him to go to kitty heaven Dr. Hazanow made a house call so that I didn't have to take him out of the house and stress him out before it was time. I appreciated that so much. I now have 2 cats that are 3 and wouldn't take them anywhere else. The staff and vets at Seven Hills are really great and you know that they really care. I've recommended them to other pet owners, and they love them too.</text>

Dr. Hazanow is awesome and the staff are all super friendly and helpful! We were recommended to go here when our dog developed back issues and they were so helpful and kind with treating him both in the short and long term. Extremely thorough and genuinely concerned about our pet's well-being. I hope I never have to go anywhere else!< /text>

I explained that nothing was wrong with my dog and that I just wanted to purchase flea meds but was still refused service. According to Cindy, they are overwhelmed(I was the only customer) and it was not possible for me to purchase the medication. This is a shame because this is the closest vet to my apartment. I hope their reception improves and I will keep this rating at 1 star until my experience with this business changes.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We were so pleased to bring our girls to Seven Hills.  Allen and the staff were so friendly, respectful and attentive to our girls' needs-particularly as they are very shy and shaken up by the long 15hr flight from Asia to SF. Everyone was very patient and gentle.  Looking forward to our next visit, hopefully not too soon though ;-)< /Text>

I can't say enough great things about Seven Hills and their Veterinarians. You can tell that they love animals and want to keep them healthy and happy. I was really worried when I moved to SF with my 15 year old cat that was sick with cancer, but after going to Seven Hills I was so glad that I did move to SF, they really helped with his care and keeping him comfortable. And when it was time for him to go to kitty heaven Dr. Hazanow made a house call so that I didn't have to take him out of the house and stress him out before it was time. I appreciated that so much. I now have 2 cats that are 3 and wouldn't take them anywhere else. The staff and vets at Seven Hills are really great and you know that they really care. I've recommended them to other pet owners, and they love them too.</review>

The friendliest, most compassionate and dedicated veterinary team I've ever met.
They practice a great quality veterinary medicine and are always involving me in every decision is made for both my babies. I highly recommend Seven Hills Veterinary.< /text>

<text>I've been taking my cat to 7 Hills for awhile now. I've seen 3 of the vets and liked the care each of them provided. They each spent all the time I needed to find out the range of possible etiologies for a weird fur/skin condition. I liked that they started with conservative treatment including omegas. The front desk staff is super helpful - gave me a sample of food to try before I bought a bag. When I needed reassurance they gave it to me without making me feel like a wuss. Easy parking. Check out 7 Hills!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7e73b3cda18d:0x19947d705feac904</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fantastic people to care for you pooch. We see doctor Taylor who is wonderful. Honestly, one of the Vet Techs really messed a procedure up for us, but I'd still give them 5 stars over any other Vet in the city (and we have been to a few.)</Review>

Dr. T and everyone at Seven Hills are so good with our girls when we bring them in. The cats may start out hiding under the bench but the staff gets them comfortable in no time. Top notch service.</Text>

Seven Hills treated my 15 year-old Lhasa Apso and my Lhasa puppy both splendidly.  From the receptionists to the vets, care is professional, wait time is minimal, and they are easy about scheduling.  The vets know what they are doing,  and are trustworthy.  Rates are about the same as the SPCA.<//review>

Dr. Whitaker is always very thorough, spends a lot of time with the dog and owner, and explains things clearly. Wait times are short to none, too, they're open evening and I think they have some Saturday appointments, so it's convenient for those of us who work during the weekdays.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We've been taking our dog to Seven Hills since we moved to San Francisco last summer, and they've done a great job caring for him. Their services were highly recommended by the dog walker we work with and we were not disappointed by the vets and staff at Seven Hill. All the employees are friendly and accommodating and the vets are thorough and extremely knowledgeable.<//Review>

<Review>Our cat and dog both love Seven Hills Veterinary Hospital. Satu (our dog) is friends with all three vets and is very happy to go through the door! His teeth are better than ever now that Dr Hazanow sorted them out; bad breath is a thing of the past! There is a high standard of veterinary care and everyone there has a genuine love of animals. I would highly recommend this veterinary clinic.</Review>< Pictures>

We have known Dr Knobel for over 25 years.  Her compassion and expertise with our pets has been wonderful. Her staff has been terrific.  Our dog doesn't get upset being there in the office.   Our pets are a part of our family and she understands our feelings for them.  Her recommendations allow for both the feelings and economics of pet care.

I would highly recommend Dr. Knoble and Seven Hills Vet Hospital<//Text>

Love Seven Hills Vet!! They are super professional, knowledgable and friendly… going the extra mile e.g. automated vaccination reminders for your pup. Also appreciate that they are happy to communicate via email. Location is also easy, with less traffic and guaranteed parking in the Diamond Heights shopping area. Highly recommended!!<//Review>

<review>Riley has had a very rough start,  he's a 6 month old mini Australian shepherd. Since we brought him into our family he has had nothing but health problems, everything from a cough to allergies to seizures. We have been to around 4 different others vets who would just push hard medication onto Riley that they weren't even sure would work as well as not even taking the time to ask questions about what we wanted or taking the chance to look into his history. That all changed once we took Riley to Seven Hills. The moment we got there we were greeted with smiles, and once we got into the room we knew we found a diamond in a pile of rocks. His vet treated him as an individual instead of "just another dog", going over every single one of his problems with me, thinking deeply about the possible causes and laying out a plan for the future. It's the first time I've felt someone actually cared about Riley and the struggles we've been going trough with him. If you want a vet that actually cares about the well being of your furbaby instead of just taking your money I highly recommend Seven Hills!<//review><UserId.>114537717252470259085< /UserId.>< date>

Seven Hills have taken care of my boy Murphy for years now. He's a Golden with most of the typical problems that Goldens have, and the staff at Seven Hills have been great at dealing with them. They're great - they tell me what's going on, what to expect, and make sure we understand the issues and what to do and not do. All of that is great, but it's the little things that make a difference. For instance, when Murph had surgery, they called with updates because they knew we were worried. The staff have all gotten to know him, and when he greets them and asks for a belly rub, they indulge him. That kind of sincerity goes a long way. They're good people and good at what they do. I can't recommend them strongly enough.< /text>

<text>I have worked most consistently with Dr. Hazanow, but have also worked with Dr. Knoble.  Both are wonderful.  Dr. Hazanow treated both of my dogs who had cancer.  In each case she gave me several treatment options, and helped me understand how each would help, and how much it would cost.  When one was too sick, she helped me through the decision of when to euthanize - and came to my house to make the transition as easy as possible for my family.  Seven Hills Vets is caring, and careful with our pets.  My dogs may not love visiting the vet, but I do.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Absolutely the best veterinarians in San Francisco.  Sandy Hazinow and Constance Noble are outstanding.  My dog Dram has been cared for by Dr. Hazinow for 14 years, through puppy age to sr. dog.  Now as we face the sunset of his years, the care and compassion by everyone at Seven Hills is unmatched.  Unqualified recommendation.</Review>

We are new to the neighborhood so I need a new Vet for my Little Gracie Girl.

This is such a warm friendly and caring place. I like our new Vet & the staff much more then our old one.<//Review>

< Review>
We have seen all the veterinarians here and each has their very special way of taking care of my furbabies. They have seen me when I have had to do the most difficult decision of saying goodbye and cared not just for my babies but made sure I was okay. Thank you Seven Hills.<//Review>

Of the many vets I have worked with, Dr. Hazanow ranks at the very top. She helped us care for Aidan, our Irish Setter dog, in his elder years. He enjoyed a long life for his breed, but the last couple of years was tough, as he developed bladder disease and complications. Dr. Hazanow provided empathic problem-solving care that was clinically competent and highly attuned to both Aidan's needs and our needs as his caregivers. Never were we rushed through an appointment. Charges are reasonable and I never felt that anything being recommended--procedures, medications, or other care products--had any taint of profit motive. Indeed, Dr. Hazanow several times suggested cost-effective solutions available from the drugstore or the supermarket. When she was not available, Drs. Knobel and Whitaker could also be relied on to provide excellent patient and family centered care, and the support staff were competent and very helpful. A couple minor front desk problems I experienced could have happened anywhere and the staff were apologetic and quick to fix them. Seven Hills is a veterinary practice and facility where you and your family can expect high quality, respectful client-centered services and supports for your pet.< /text>

< Review>
I have seen both Dr. Hazanow and Dr. Knoble at Seven Hills.  Both are extremely knowledgeable and caring.  The reception staff and vet techs are also wonderful.  I can honestly say that Dr. Hazanow saved my cocker spaniel twice from near death health issues and was great at diagnosing the problem.    Recently she helped with some dental surgery on my near 16 year old cocker mix and all is going well.  I highly recommend Seven Hills.</Review>

<Text>Great Care, a well-staffed and well-run small office where you can see anyone and be assured that your pup is in good hands. It's clean (which really matters to me) and they sell a small but solid line of things like dog toothpaste and brushes. Easy location with PARKING which, if you are transporting a sick or injured dog, is a huge bonus.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x808f7e73b3cda18d:0x19947d705feac904</Gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate>< date>

<Review>Been taking my dog here since moving to SF and while they do great work I find them to be more expensive than most vets in the area, and they price their supplies above list price which is a bit annoying as I'd rather give them the business but have a hard time paying more than manufacturer suggested price.<//Review>< pictures>

I sometimes like to take in cash to make a payment, could someone please tell me if they closed and where can I pay my bill in person?

Contrary to my bad experiences with Comcast, this office handled by a single lady at the time I went there was most pleasant experience of all. She almost hanged my opinion about Comcast Monopoly.</Text>

<review>I just looked at my mother-in-laws bill. She has been paying for a 2nd box for 2 years and she only has 1 tv. When Xfinity came out 2 years ago to upgrade her service, the gave her a new box but forgot to remove her old box from her account. They will only credit her with 3 months., even though it was their fault. They told me she was responsible for catching the error. She’s 83, that’s customer service.</review>< pictures>

9/10 I try to actually go to the store to pay my bill they are closed.  They have 1 person who works in there and sometimes her lunch is 1130 to noon. Sometimes it seems it's noon to 1. Every once in a while it's 1 to 1:30 or you know, whenever you get a chance to go on your lunch leave your work and go pay your bill.< /Text>

😀 Store is clean and clutter free, staff members are courteous,knowledgeable, professional.😀 I was very welcome 🙏 ☺ in the store 😀 staff member told me a joke and had me laughing 😆.  I also found out that O'Reilly sales folding eye 👁 glasses 👓. This really surprised 😮 me. Ended up buying two pairs of folding 👀 eye 👁 glasses 👓. 🤔 When I arrived on Travis Air Force Base informed a few of my friends about these folding eye 👁 glasses 👓. O'Reilly keep up the very good work. Also like the sales that are going on. Especially when 🤔 every single thing is going up. Thank you 😊 for being a part of Vacaville Community. And close to Travis Air Force Base.<//Text>

I also purchased windshield blades and a broken tail lite. I was assisted by the clerk, EADAM. He was so sweet and helpful, even tho it was a very hot day.  He installed the window blades, the dip stick and the broken tail lite.  That is my go-to-store.<//review>< name>

<user>106333729864619080885< /user><pics>None</pics><text>Not a bad place overall, staff was nice and helpful. A couple of things I noticed was they only had a parts manual for their store brand of filters... I know you can ask, but still let me choose without having to spend time asking or looking it up on my phone. They also only had one type of windshield washing refill fluid. I know that I live in a typically above freezing area but I've been known to travel at times to colder regions.. maybe they just had a run on below freezing gallon jugs...</text></record>

Was an amazing and refreshing experience. Had a hard day at work today and came in to buy coils, leads and Sparks and she really just turned the day around.
I love this store and will continue to do my business here for the great customer service and expertise behind the counter.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Really bad service, lazy attendants, not willing to helo at all. Came looking for some wiper blades for my nissan altima, asked them to install them. Manager said come back in 1 hour, lazy. Call Autozone they did installem in 5 minutes, look for another place if you want good service not this place with this lazy employees.< /Text>

I had a headlight go out-second time in two years. Elijah, told me both bulbs should have been replaced and proceeded to replace my bulbs. The right side was a pain to get out-took two others, Christian and another person, to wrangle it out, but they did it. Elijah replaced my bulbs, and made sure they worked. He also cleaned the leaves out of the wiper area. The price didn't hurt my wallet either.< /review>

<Text>Brought in brakes that have a lifetime warranty. They told me they couldnt find the purchase on their files. And when I talked to the manager he said sorry theres nothing I can do for you and looked at me so are you gonna buy them or not? I just went to autozone and bought some new brakes with lifetime warranty as well. The manager in there assured me that I wouldnt even need to bring my old brakes in and I would be taken care of. I highly recommend not buying your lifetime warranty parts here.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Went here to purchase wipers for my Acadia.
After purchasing wipers recommended by part # gadget, The wiper didn't fit. Seeking help from the assistant manager who was uncooperative and rude. I sought the help of another employee. After two failed attempts at finding the right wiper, I finally ask for refund and left. I would not reccomend this place.</Review>

The service is excellent! Quick.  Only dissatisfaction is that I asked for pico de gallo on the side, it wasn't in our bag, and we ordered 7 burritos.  Only were given 5 small containers of salsa...< /text>

Rude.
About 3 weeks ago I went again maybe just not a good day well still no Leno wife is rude  you would think she will be nice to her customers especially she knows you well nope. My father can not stand up to long and he was leaning on the counter on the side away from customers ordering or picking she told he couldn't be there all rude not a single please. I'm done I won't be giving business to them!!!< /Review>

<review>The chicken steet tacos have lettuce "really" and the carne asada tacos are blane all the put on it was onions, red sauce and carne asada (no cilantro) the carne asada looked like ground beef instead of carne asada. The rice was hard but the beans were the only thing that taste good.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Text>Absolutely terrible customer service. They got my order wrong and then lied about what I ordered. REFUSED To REMAKE OR REFUND. was so offended I left the food. Such a bad experience I don't think I ever want fast food again from anywhere.

We visited Leno's on 12/30/2019 about 4:30 pm. We were greeted by a young man with the most beautiful smile and best attitude. The food was delicious and came up quickly. The young man even came to check in on us a few minutes later to make sure we didn't need anything else. Great service and food!</text>

<time>1591401041872<//time><Text>I’ve been going to Leno’s for over 15 years and will never go back after the experience I had today.My order included a combination carne asada burrito, but the person taking my order appeared slow, confused with difficulty spelling and writing my order. He apparently wrote down a combination pork burrito. When I received my order I noticed the discrepancy and explained that my order was incorrect, but the employee I spoke to (Leno’s son) stated that he didn’t take the order and wasn’t able to give out, “free food”. I just want what I paid for but he proceeded to be rude and refused to make the situation right. Not good business. Leno just lost a long time customer and I hope that a $5 burrito is worth it to them to receive a poor review. I will take my business elsewhere.<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>This is my mother's favorite place to eat, great traditional "Real", Mexican food ! Great business progression. OMG I can't stop eating at this place!
So I  remember way, way, back in the day when the place was actually an A&W Burger place with window service and the whole works. Then it was a mom and
pop burger place that was successful. Then came this Mexican food place? Next to the high school with the open campus at that time, maybe this was not the best idea?
But, what did I know right because this is the best Taco joint around!<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
Leno's Rico Tacos has been in business at this location for many years and has become very well know to the locals here for their reputation of their excellent quality of food, professional relationship with customers, and the management of the day to day operations. I definitely recommend a meal at this fine local Mexican food restaurant.</review>

<text>Fantastically overstuffed carne asada tacos!!! Even came with a fresh lime wedge and a few pieces of jalapeno pickled carrots with onion. Definitely coming back for more of those. I also had the pork and green chili burrito which was also yummy and good size for the price. Nice set up with the option to dine in or enjoy the weather outside. The staff were nice and patient with me making up my mind with very little wait for my meal.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I want to say I’m so disappointed in this place !!! Me and my family would come here after the high school games , never again would I spend my money there , I made a mistake on my order and the wife refuse to change my order , for her being her age she should understand that people make mistakes and it is fixable , but instead refuse to take my order and closed the window on me , we are human and make mistakes she could’ve handled it with a professional way sorry that They lost are Business

They deserve no stars but I had to put one in order to post my review thank you< /Review>< pictures>

I came across this place by accident. Boy was I lucked. They make killer menudo and tacos for a few pennies. Champrrado is served nice and warm. They have indoor seating and are very interested in giving the customer good service.</review>

<Text>Authentically delicious !
I have been meaning to do this review for some time now.  I discovered this little place over a year ago, while in the area.

This place is nice and clean and you may eat on the patio, take out or eat inside.
I have had several items on the menu and never been let down.
Leno is the owner and He really knows what he's doing.

I love the consistency of flavors, never wavering!  My favorites are his Chili Colorado, the meat nearly melts in your mouth it is so tender!
The Chili Verde is wonderful sometimes a tad bit spicy, but never overpowering.
If you just want the best beans and rice in town well this is it!

So not only is the price right, but the food is very good!
Thank you for great food and great service!
Way to go Leno!

Of all the tacos I've ever had, this place was, and I don't say this lightly, THE BEST! Leno was there when I came in. I heard the meat is a little different when he's there (not sure if that's true). The menu had a nice variety but I had to get tacos. So I got chicharron, shrimp, and carnitas tacos. AMAZING! The meats and shrimp were perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor. They toast up the corn tortilla a bit so that added a nice dimension of flavor and texture I enjoyed. And the green salsa was legit. I was surprised they had melon juice and thats my favorite so I ordered theirs. It was a nice accompaniment to the INSANE tacos. I love this place and I look forward to eating here again.<//Text>

The tacos combination and their carne asada burrito, the tortillas are cold.  Online they say they are open until 9pm but they actually close at 8pm. They will box your items before 7:30pm, even though they are still open. Not returning again!<//Review>

<text>Authentic Mexican street food without the cart. Large choice of select meats to choose from. The pastor is moist not dry like many places. The carne asada is too. Fam loves the platters and in our experience the rice and beans have been fresh every time. Went there just recently with co workers from back east and they wanted to bring the restaurant back with them.< /text>< Pictures>

The cashier had 0 customer service skills.  Looked like she didn't want to be at work. Food wasn't what I expected.  Had no flavor. I don't think I'll be going back.</review>

Found a hair in my carne asada fries which weren't even that good then he said "are you sure it isnt yours?" Like it wasnt deep in the fries. Lost my appetite and money. Also the customer service was horrible. Had another encounter before this, they were rude while me and a group of friends waited outside they banged and yelled for us to get the food inside.<//text>

Quality and customer service was very poor. I used to love this place but I was very unhappy this time. The man at the counter was argumentative and rude. Who argues with a customer over no chile on my kid's taco??! Apparently that is acceptable now... I was very polite when I asked him if they could remake the taco with no chile and he got very upset ranting about "you didnt tell me. I would've wrote it down. It's your fault but I'll eat the cost and make a new one." I'm positive I order with no chile because I always say PLAIN... funny thing is there was no onion or cilantro lol.< /Text>

Came in with high expectations from all the reviews and the food here is completely mediocre. I got an Horchata and it tasted like soap. Burrito was mostly flavorless. You poor folk need to eat some real Mexican food. This stuff is close to garbage. I woulda figured 50 miles north of the border would have decent Mexican food. I was wrong. I gave two stars because the food at least didn't give me diarrhea.<//text>< Pics>

Its not even legit Mexican food those tacos are far from street tacos, they even charge for refills. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!! Unless you want really bad indagestion.</Review>< pics>

Ordered 2 tacos, 1 beef 1 chicken and a side order of beans and rice. The meat in both tacos was flavorless; the rice was dry and didn't seem very fresh and the beans also seemed old and were so so.  We were on our way to Del Taco and made a u turn to come back and try this place for the first time. Needless to say it was a disappointment.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Before it was a good place to eat but now the brother of the owner who helps him only to lift orders is a pushy person and has no way of treating people and insults people and the owner is present does not say anything bad place to visit something that no longer works

(Original)
Antes era un buen lugar para comer pero ahora ya no el hermano del dueño que le ayuda a solo alzar órdenes es una persona prepotente y no tiene forma.de tratar la gente e insulta a las personas y el dueño hay presente no dice nada mal lugar para visitar algo que ya no sirve< /Review>

Inside very refreshing with its air at the ideal temperature.
