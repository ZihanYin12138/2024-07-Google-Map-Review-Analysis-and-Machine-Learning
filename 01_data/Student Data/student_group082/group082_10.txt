I got the Thai hot pot this time and it was really good! The soup was flavorful, it had lots of veggies, toppings, and 2 large shrimps. It came with bun.

My friend got the bun bo hue bowl and she really enjoyed it. I thought it was a bit small, but she said it was perfect. She wanted it a little spicier, so she asked for the red chili on the side.

As usual, we had to end it with the Saigon sweetheart. Everyone loved it!</text>

Came here on a Saturday night around 7pm. When we walked in, the place wasn't packed, but it still took 15 min to get a table. We did get water right away. They only had 1 waiter and we had to wait about 20 min to get our food order taken. Anything I asked for, like drinks they didn't have, dessert as well.

Each plate of food came 5 to 10 min after each other. I ordered the seafood hot Pot and it came with more veggies than seafood. It also didn't have any taste. I also ordered the lemon wings and those did taste good.< /Text>

We came on a Wednesday at 1pm. The place wasn't busy, there were only 2 occupied tables when we came. The place was very spacious, loved the earthly tone of the furnitures and the decors. And since the place is almost empty, we got our orders real fast. The foods were delicious, the serving size was good. I can't compare how this place looks like when it's packed, but I'm glad we came on a non-peak hour. Service was very good too, not excellent but better than most. Overall, it was an enjoyable lunch for me and my son.<//text>

I really liked the sauce, my pork was a little dry as I got my plate but eating it together with some of the sauce and rice balanced it out! Ah I really liked the mam mam with beef, and will probably try the beef garlic noodle bowl next time I go. Make sure you stir your ingredients around! I let my mushrooms sizzle a little and YUM! Love those enoki mushrooms. ❤ I cleaned out my whole plate heh.
My brother had the Story Rd short ribs and he enjoyed it. :)< /Text>< user_name>

First time visiting this place love the ambiance setting and service. Their wings, panko shrimp and edamame are a must for appetizers. Our server Juan did an outstanding job answering our menu questions and making sure we were ok with our drinks. Definitely going back!!!!< /Review>

Stopped in for lunch.   Awesome beef noodles.
Just like the name. Plate came out sizzling. So good. Especially the noodles and corn that get burnt during eating it. It us slow now so the service is good. Price is great for the amount of food.< /Text>

Great pizza spot!
Casual atmosphere with limited seating.
The pizza is thin NY style and reasonably priced! I tried the cheese with chunks of roasted garlic which was delicious.
This is a great choice if you're looking for a casual date or somewhere to have a low key yummy meal.<//Text>

< Review>
Yummy sizzling plate restaurant! They have everything from hot pot to chicken wings to sizzling plates. The plates were actually sizzling hot and managed to scorch the rice and corn after resting on the plate for a while. Very hipster vibe and also seems like a great place to watch a sports game, given all the LCD screens and the bar area. Great idea for a restaurant and excellent execution. Loved the wall decor and the chalk art! Place was surprisingly bustling at 3:30pm on a Wednesday!</Review>

I should have/could have sue them! I ordered shrimp dish and there was beef at bottom of the plate. It was not in menu or they were aware of it.  I am Hindu and cow's are sacred! These stupid people were not aware of it! NOT EVEN ONE STAR, your food is mixed up and they wont care..
If thats not enough, they bring all food together. We ordered sweet potato for starters, couple of dishes for later. food was cold till finish starters!!
Other dish with rice sizzling was burned black coal from rice!< /review>

This is a good restaurant and the food quality and customer service is definitely a 5 🌟 but it took too long for the food during lunch. But that won't deter me from eating here as the food is good. I would order ahead of time during weekday lunch but I wouldn't mind waiting for dinner or when I don't have a limited amount of time to eat.< /Text>

< Review>
This is my husband's and my favorite spot for dinner.  I really love hot pot, and Sizzle Spot's curry chicken pot is probably my favorite hot pot around.   The udon noodles are always cooked just right (not overcooked) and the veggies are crisp and cook just to your liking at the table.  I love the addition of the taro chunks to the coconut curry base.  So good!  My husband always gets the garlic steak sizzle plate -- definitely go for the butter bomb, because that just puts it over the top!  Sizzle Spot's boba tea offerings are delicious, too.  The atmosphere of the place is nice enough for a romantic dinner, but the price says "drop in anytime!"  Whenever we can't decide where to go for dinner, we always end up coming back to Sizzle Spot.< /Review>

Cheaper than pepper lunch, and also a better location for me. Mammam is the best thing I've had here so far. The salmon is alright. The wings are a bit small. But the mammam is a banger for sure. Goes great with some sauce and a bit of spice. Corn fritters are a good snack too. Good prices, not too busy, and pretty good flavor.<//Review>

<text>This restaurant has good food. Also, my brother and sister try to eat at this restaurant, at least once a month. The amenities of this restaurant is good. My only concern is the wait time for my order. In addition, it is problematic to find a parking spot in this  shopping center.< /text>< pics>

The food was aaaaaamazing! Prices were great for the amount you get.The resturant was very clean and neat. I only gave it a 4 star because there was an older lady and a younger one behind the counter on their phones talking the whole time. Only one guy was on the floor helping everyone</Review>

Came here on a Friday night for dinner and there was no wait.  I kind of high high expectations when I heard this was an asian fusion restaurant, but there wasn't anything too special about this place.  Its like a combination of Pepper Lunch + Boiling Point..but with traditional Vietnamese dishes.  I ordered the Sizzle Spicy Noodle Pot, which is essentially a BBH (bun bo hue) in a hot pot where they put noodles on the side which i thought was totally unnecessary.  If I wanted BBH, I'd just go to the shop next door.  Putting a traditional beef noodle soup in a hot pot form is not what I would consider asian fusion.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Yo I'm back again at Sizzle Spot because I had the cravings.
They have a new menu now, and offer more varieties of entrees to choose from??!

Got my spectacular (MAKE IT YOURSELF):
Veggies, Beef, Garlic Noodles, Egg. I noticed this time that they added a butter ball to the dish, made my noodles super creamy yum. The portions here are worth the money, because you'll be filled up.

Anyways, I used my 15% off discount for yelp check in, such a deal woo. But I noticed that their sign said student discounts were 15% off with ID presented but the dude only gave my friend 10... hmm. We let it off the hook though because he was pretty good lookin'.
Oh yeah no complementary dessert this time though, i sad.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1534357867309, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time to leave your feedback. We value your business.'}<//response>< GmapID>

Awesome experience!! If you like Pepper Lunch(Milpitas) you will love this place more or if you haven't you will not regret.

Bigger portions and tastes better. If you like crispy edge burnt rice/noodles this place does it just right on your sizzling plate. You are able to customize dish with rice/noodles, meat, and veggies. Don't be fooled by picture...you get alot probably from 1 sizzling dish without the extra meat. It also comes with a side pickled cabbage similar that goes well when mixing with your main dish. Cup of water doesn't taste like faucet water like other Asian food places.

Online reservation elimates long waiting time. Why wait when you can spend the other time doing other things you want. Also the space is decent size so no worrying about being in crammed up space and hot plates hitting your face.

My only criticism would be that the tables/chair could use a bit of wipe down.

Highly recommend this place for group lunch or dinner!</review>

We popped in here on a nice Sunday evening, ready to get some sweet sizzle pan dindin, and we were very pleased with our meal!  It was quite funny: the meals were pretty big, so we asked for a box to go, but the owner must have thought that we didn't like the food, because she seemed quite distraught by our request.

THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!! AND WE WILL BE BACK!

I wouldn't say the serving sizes are mind-blowingly large, but they are very generous.  Especially if you are a little guy, which I am not, but if you are, then I'm sure you will find that you are adequately served.  Also got one of the coconut drinks, and it was amaze-ballz, but I am a huge fan of coconut, so I probably wouldn't be the person to ask how good it really was.  I loved it though.

One thing you should probably watch out for, this being in an Asian plaza, is the parking can get insanely crowded, so just make sure you come prepared for some hassle if you can't avoid it.</Text>

<Review>I'm always on the hunt for new boba and/or pastry places. Somehow I stumbled across Cali Bakehouse on Yelp and the pretty pictures of its interior intrigued me enough to convince me to pay them a visit. While I expected the cafe to be much more crowded based on its reviews and the pastry selection a bit more extensive.. I was not disappointed by my two visits this past weekend.

TEA -- We got their honey roasted oolong milk tea because we like the roasted flavor. This drink really hit the spot, but they need to work on consistency. This is not necessarily a negative though, because they were happy to add more tea for that kick of tea flavor when I thought my milk tea was too milky. The popping boba add-on in different flavors is a subtle and fun way to add extra flavor to your drink.

FOOD/PASTRIES -- To be honest, from the pictures, somehow I thought they had a bigger selection. I wasn't disappointed, but I wish they would heat up the pastries for you if you chose to dine-in. Again, some issues with consistency here.. On both visits we opted for Almond filled croissants.. Visit #1 the croissant LOOKED perfect but tasted stale. Visit #2 the  croissant lacked any almonds on top of it but tasted a bit fresher. These aren't a huge deal, but I feel like consistency would help improve the experience. They also offer miscellaneous sandwiches, and small bites for those hungering for more.

SERVICE -- really friendly, warm service. They actually SMILE. Twice in one visit, I was asked by two different people whether everything was good and if I needed them to adjust my drink in any way. I asked them to add more tea in my drink during my second visit and felt awful about it... But they didn't seem to resent me, whew.

INTERIOR/AMBIANCE -- whoever decorated this place should come decorate my house... Huge floor to ceiling windows allow SO MUCH natural light into the bakery, the pastries are located in a centerpiece of sorts directly in front of the door. The plates you use to hold your pastry picks are adorable. The seating includes these nice, huge, plush-like couches placed around the cafe. Lots of plants and small detail decorations add an extra flair to each table.

Cali Bakehouse definitely has a spot on my list for when I crave boba/pastries. Will be back!!<//Review>< Response>

(Translated by Google) If I had the chance to rate this place with 10 stars, I would definitely give it a go! One of the best foods I've ever eaten, super well spiced, tasty, and very cheap. The chicken portion is just wonderful! Super recommend going one of the best places to eat in California.

The phone screen was cracked so the entire phone went black and wouldn’t work. Before replacing the phone and losing everything on it, we tried Smart Phone Fix. Jacob helped us and the phone works perfectly now. He was very honest and helpful and respectful. I highly recommend Smart Phone Fix!<//Text>

< Review>
Took my daughter's iPhone with a broken lightning plug in the port. I was afraid they were going to have to take the phone apart, but he got it out clean without damaging the port - and he didn't charge us. Definitely going to take our devices here in the future.</Review>

I had such a great experience with this place not only were they able to fix my phone but did it in a timely fashion.  After I was told by another phone company I needed a new phone and my phone was unworkable they changed that real quick.   A big kudos to Jacob for fixing my phone.  Awesome place to get your phone fixed!<//review>

<Text>If you need an iPhone repair, this is the place to go!

After replacing my iPhone screen, the phone was not working. I was able to get the phone to the store in pieces and worked with Christopher who was able to  diagnose  my problem within a minute. Because I came in with all the parts for the repair, he didn't charge me for anything. He was a great guy to work with. If you need a repair on your phone, check out these guys!</Text>< Pictures>

I got off work late and was told as long as I came down before closing they would take care of my phone, I arrived only 9 mins. prior to closing and they took my phone back right away and started on screen replacement.

They HAVE never really said "No,  we don't or can't do that " but they'll do their ABSOLUTE BEST to find ur solution,  and repair the problem.  And on multiple occassions they even have gone so far beyond the blah normal or disappointing typical customer service experience,  and found out what I needed to do, how much it could cost AND tell me where I can go. This town is even better now with TWO locations. You will NEVER leave disappointed. Incredible experience each and EVERY time. Keep it up y'all! 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐+ ⭐ extra cuz you have MORE than earned it!

I come out ten minutes later and Christopher politely says “you’re phone is ready sir”. Not only do I appreciate the professionalism but the store policy and warranty is second to none.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ec6c7fc825e13f:0xba2e57a589618812< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I can not thank Nick and Maria enough. I thought for sure my phone was a gonner. I spent Easter Sunday reminiscing about photos and video I thought I would never see again. Depressing. Monday morning I was the first customer at smartphone fix and THANK YOU Nick! What I thought was terminal, Nick took care of without hesitation.   And thank you  Maria for being so sweet while I was waiting. My phone is fixed and I could not be happier.< /review>

So to start, I've been a customer of this place since it was simply a kiosk in the downstairs food court area. I've personally had over 7-8 screens replaced here, with an average of 100$ a screen lets just say I've done plenty of business with them. But today, 12/1/17 I walk in and I'm met by two faces I've never seen before. I tell them I just want the 80$ screen replacement. He spends the next 5 minutes trying to sell me a 200+$ " protection plan " for a phone that's not even worth 200$ anymore. After I've made it clear I just want a screen, he says give them about an hour,(even though the sign outside says *30 MINUTE FAST REPAIRS*) and when I return he claimed I need a battery because the battery was creating heat. He tried to sell me a battery for 50$ + tax then he tried selling me the " protection plan " saying i can save money and spend like 170 if I got the battery now. I declined all this because my battery was working fine before. So then I return because now the sim card is not being read by the iphone. When I return, he instantly goes in the back to whisper with his colleague, and comes back and instantly says " well we don't touch the sim card tray at all, but we will check out". After another half an hour, the guy comes out and says " so you see the sim card here ? It appears it's getting hot, it must be internal. " After he JUST TOLD ME the battery was getting hot..... I asked if they could honor a refund or discount of any sort being I just fixed a phone for nothing if it wasn't gonna work anymore to which he instantly said no, with no apologies or anything. Moral of my review ? This place has completely changed from fixing phone screens to trying to take your money by offering all this extra garbage and if you have even the slightest issue, they will basically tell you it's not their fault and gladly keep your money. Even if you're a 4+ year loyal customer. I will NEVER come here again and will advise all my friends not to as well. SMARTPHONE SCAM is what I will call them from now on.

UPDATE: I'm updating this because they made me sign a contract saying I would in order to help me. Today I went in to have another iPhone screen fixed since the last one they fixed had issues. End result ? they took their 5c screen back and I left with a broken screen because apparently it wouldn't work. So I paid for a screen full price that they actually took back.. I got ... well nothing and wasted more time.. Good luck if you choose them lol Although I will say their best employee is Tony, great guy stands out in the place.<//Review>

<review>Fair prices for quality pizza. They have a variety of pizza salad, and wing specialties. A personal pizza and salad combo costs $13. And you can choose between a thin, regular, or deep dish style pizza.</review></record>

Very fresh, very tasty.
Selected the "bro" combo for my lunch. 1- topping individual pizza and a green salad. Drink is NOT included.
The salad was refreshing and crisp. Pizza was good too. Very happy with my choice.< /Review>

We had three and enjoyed all of them. We tried the Margherita, the Fennel Sausage and the Speck. While the prices for the wine bottles were a bit on the high side, we were able to enjoy a good $42 red.
The desserts,on the small side were really good
Only drawback is the tables are very close together.But the other diners were very nice< /Review>< gmapID>

<Text>We lost our favorite Indian restaurant (closed) and have been searching for a wonderful replacement. I think we found it India's Tandoori! The food was just superb and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Wow! The construction of the mini-mall site is sort of off-putting but don't let that deter you from trying this Westside Gem!</Text></record>

<Review>Pesto pizza, I love you.  This was the location where I was first introduced to Escape From New York and it's deliciousness.  Now, I often find myself making excuses to go here or the Castro just to get a slice of that gooey cheese and lovely pesto on a thin and slightly crunchy crust.  Mmm...</Review>< pics>

Great food but 17 out of 20 times that I have ordered from there, they either forgot to give me ranch for the dip or not toss the wings in the sauce when I ask to be tossed in. Very annoying!!!<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>I've purchased pizza from Fresh Brothers multiple times, and would have probably recommended the place until the latest visit - the person who was cutting/packing the pizza was wearing the single use gloves on the kitchen (which is a must during epidemics), but then this person took couple of pizza to bring them out to Doordash driver, they opened the door with gloves when exiting, then opened the door when entering, touched couple of surfaces inside, and then went to cut/pack another pizza without taking a clean pair of gloves (I happen to wait for my pizza and was observing the whole thing). Sorry, that's not OK, even during regular times they should have washed their hands ... Waiting extra 10 minutes to get my pizza and the need to get inside to get it (instead of promised curbside pickup) sounds like nitpicking. As of pizza - Ok pizza, not the best, not the worst.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1594918223648, 'text': "We appreciate you letting us know that the quality you experienced did not meet our standards.

<review>Wife & I tried Fresh Bro's at the beginning of the Pandemic; with their "Take & Name" pizza (they make the pizza but don't cook it. We pick it up & throw it in our own oven)... And we love it. Fresh Bro's is our Go-To now for pizza, as long as we have the time to bake it ourselves. If we're doing delivery, we don't actually live close enough to a Fresh Brothers, unfortunately.

I am a big lover of "Mom & Pop" style locations & certainly so for pizza, but Fresh Brothers is pretty good & my wife is a huge fan, so my Mom & Pop shops are 2nd to Fresh Bros... For now.

Either way, definitely worth trying!
And if you're comparing between other, more corporate pizza spots, I like Fresh Bros better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's etc... All of them.< /review><Time>1592940575740</Time>< user_name>

Pizza is definitely 5/5, would eat again! We ordered half Lebanese garlic chicken and half Jamaican chicken, we also ordered the lemon pepper and habanero wings. I prefer the habanero wings over the lemon pepper, but it's not mind blowing so 3/5.<//review>

Gluten free, cauliflower, skinny and original crust pizza as well as vegan cheese to meet everyone's needs. A salad menu adds to the variety and therefore appeal of ordering from Fresh Brother's for a large group. The food was ready in a timely manner and pick up was quick and efficient. We were very happy with our experience and will certainly return!</Text>

Very disappointed in our service the last few times we have ordered, which is sad because we thought this was going to be our new pizza place. Wanted to use coupon for 10% off pick up on our NYE order....can't use coupon when ordering via phone and can't pay cash when ordering via internet (which if you have ever ordered for a large party you understand the necessity of having cash payments).< /Text>

Ordered today — second time from this location and the second time they’ve messed up my order. Was super bummed to get mild sauce rather than the hot sauce I ordered for the 15 wings. Had to give them to my friend since it’s not what I wanted or ordered. Called to rectify the situation, and nothing could be done. So bogus! Won’t order from this one again.<//Text>

Decent pizza place.. A little better than Pappa John's and other chain competitors. Not stingy with toppings and baked to crispy. Caesar Salad was not so fresh one time.< /review>

Walla food was good I feel like it was a little bit expensive for the amount of food that you received. Sauces were flavorful and staff was extremely friendly.</Review>

The food was sooooo good. It was on the expensive side though. I went with my family of 5, and we bought the family pack that fed "4 people." We are big eaters, and there was still some food left.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The pizza is really delicious and the dough is thin
Make sure you have a salad You can eat a lot of pizza
The rest of the food was alright.

I’ve brought two of my vehicles all the way from the Bay Area to Merced Tire and Wheels because a trustworthy mechanic can be hard to find.  Office staff, as well as the mechanics are great! They’re efficient, professional and thorough. Hector is amazing! Highly recommended.<//text>

Great place if you want to pay to fix an issue twice. After they supposedly fixed the issue with the car and gave it back. A ball joint pops out while car is going down the street. For those who don't know what that means. You loose complete control of your car. The reason why this happened was because of they're negligence. They forgot to put the Carter pin back in threw the castle nut. So the nut came off.</review>

Second time here, this time to have winter tires changed to summer tires.
Obtained same day serivce while I waited.  Best price in town, too.  Half of lowest price I found in town, too.  Felt guity so gave the tech a nice tip.

My new go-to shop. Suffered a punctured tire. I have the never in stock run flat tire. Called at 5 pm. Hector ordered and had tires in by 830 next morning and called when they were in. Once arrived, he had me in and out in 30 minutes for two tires balanced and installed.

Fair price, too.<//Text>

Sandal season is here. We stopped by A to Z Nails for relaxing pedicures. No appointment and did not have to wait. Amazing how great our feet feel and look! Very welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Stayed and got our nails done too. The folks here are very good at not only making you look good but feel good too!
Great experience and highly recommended.</Text>

<text>Went here for a walk-in appointment with my mother, thought it was going to be great when greeted by the women...then we sat in the pedicure chairs and after 15 minutes two men approached us and started working on our toes. Not a hello, not a smile, not even a conformation on my polish color. They were extremely rude, giving us nasty looks and attitude. The man working on my mom's toes tried to put foam flip flops on her but wasn't paying attention and smudged her polish and rolled his eyes at her like it was her fault. Very rude, medic-ore pedicure, and terrible customer service. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<GmapID>0x54d292b438fa69ed:0xe30a3fd467af9cec< /GmapID><text>I live 3 hours away and even before when I lived 10 hours away I visited Redding often. This is the only place I get my nails done and have an amazing experience every time. They listen to exactly what I want and take their time. I’ve never had a place so gentle with my hands and take such great care of me. This last time I came in with a half broken nail and without using a fake tip he was able to use acrylic to shape my nail out perfectly. I am extremely rough on my nails but never have had any troubles with them staying on after going here. Nothing but great words for this review.<//text>< userid>

<Text>I have been going here for quite a while, but I scheduled a pedicure after pandemic, they weren’t on time & failed to tell me ahead of time that My pedicure would be $40.00 not $25.00 like always & that it would be cash only, which hit me wrong also??? And he didn’t do a good job getting off the dead stuff on my heels, it’s unfortunate because I like Mindy & her staff, we all have to recover from this pandemic but price gouging is not right</Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

I get the dip nails and they only have about 10 color options. The woman doing my nails had very long nail that hurt every time she had to tap off the excess powder. And at the last step she was checking to see if my nails were dry and I heard her say “oops” I couldn’t see in the dim light what she was referencing but she just kept saying it’s fine, it’s fine. When I got outside in the sun I could see she had smudged one of my nails.<//text></record>

<Review>I made a appt. They were very good with quick service, but maybe too quick. First off my pedi wasn't even a pedi. Not even soft feet, they feel the same. Hella rough on cleaning cuticles. My mani just went down hill as well, he cut my cuticle on my thumb so low, now my thumb went stop bleeding. Which lead me to not do color no more, just to coat. In the end, he was going to charge me full price, even though he knew he messed up bad and did a horrible job. Will never go back again. Please girls go to Beyond Beuty on trinity st. In redding. I should of trusted my gut and went there. They are worth it. Not this place .< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkNNGiF1QwKwpC4kh6LD9irNM_GlB4rK3fG3N4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

I’ve been coming to this salon for a year now and have had a great experience every time I’ve come to see Vinh. He makes sure to take his time and pay close attention to detail. There’s never been a time Vinh worked on my nails and I walked out unhappy. My nails always look absolutely perfect and could last forever. Definitely recommend seeing him!!</Text>

<text>The place was clean and the people were mostly nice, however, my gel was applied so fast that now I see the unevenness in my nail in the light but luckily I think I’m the only one that notices that. My boyfriend couldn’t tell. But just one of those personal pet peeves, I like the gel to look even!!!<//text>< Pictures>

When I said something about it, it was a problem. When i stated certain things i didnt want she didnt listen and did what she wanted. She knew i was upset and i told her why only for her to chuckle and make excuses. Very unprofessional. Worst nails I've ever had done and I have been getting them done for over 8 years. I won't recommend this place to anyone.  If anything go somewhere else.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>This organization provided the most extraordinary facility dog for my special ed classroom. He has transformed lives of the students he works with. I can't say enough good things about this organization, it's volunteers and puppy raisers. They are a godsend. And we are eternally grateful.< /Review>< Name>

<text>Truly the most amazing place ever.  Every person affiliated with this organization from breeders to puppy raisers to the vet office to canine instructors to those who work behind the scenes such as the lunch volunteers and local chapters each make this place an amazing place to be connected to. I'm forever grateful for the incredible gift they've bestowed upon me. I've been given the honor of being paired with an extraordinary dog because each dedicated person working there. I am especially blessed for my instructor.< /text>< date>

Ok for walking in front on sidewalk, otherwise I've been told the property (with beautifully landscaped grounds) is "closed" to the public. What a pity.<//Text>

Great pool table for a buck, haven't use their cues, we bring our own.
You can rent the ps4 and play.
Punching game.
Hookah and beer!
Great Mediterranean food next door and they are cool bringing your food in!<//review><gmap_id>0x80d95a05de2b8765:0x3354faadcf4d1fdc</gmap_id>< Name>

Shortly after arriving at A1 hookah bar,( WHERE I WAS SUPPOSE TO MEET MY SIS/FRIENDS FOR HER BIRTHDAY.)  I needed to use the restroom.   only I arrived early, as I was waiting. I entered A1 Hookah Bar,  walked past the front section, as I approached the pool table, a guy (speaking a different language) started calling speaking loader/repeating his statement 3 times.
I walked past him, and entered the ladies room.  Literally, as I was about to sit down to per;  a man starts knocking, insisting that "open the door."  Said "ill be put in a a minute." "No, open THE DOOR!  I opened the door, (HE DID NOT ASK ME ANYTHING,) to find a mani was told "get out for paying customers ONLY! NOW OUT."  Needless to say we are not spending her birthday at the A1 hookah bar!!!  I personally found them to be extremely rude and unprofessional. But by all means if that's how you like to be treated, please go to A1 hookah bar<//review>

This place is a joke. I got sick from smoking out of their hookah's and when I took a closer look at their hose, you could see some residue as if someone else was using it before and they just passed it on to me. The atmosphere is kind of sketchy, probably because most of the people that frequent this place aren't the people you want to hang out with. Most of the people in there had their feet on the table which makes me wonder what else goes on in there since it's pretty dark at night especially.<//Review>

They tried to up charge me $10 per day because they gave away my car when I arrived about 2 hours after reservation time. Take your business elsewhere.</review>< pics>

<Review>After making a reservation a week in advance and having confirmation that the vehicle would be ready by 0800, they had nothing upon arrival.  Because I was dropped off expecting my vehicle to be ready to go, I had to wait while they had one delivered.  I’ve never had a problem like this from Enterprise which will be my obvious choice the next time I need to rent a car.</Review><username>Brett Christenson<//username><date>1581525452010<//date><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

No sense of urgency. They had three employees in the office and it still took them over forty minutes to help the three people in line in front of me. All I needed was to pick up a car I had reserved. I’m used the airport where they actually get you to your car quickly so this was very frustrating. Save yourself some time and ditch this place for the hertz at the Ontario airport.</Text>

Im a frequent customer at Hertz and when I need to extend my rental weekly or need help, DARA is the greatest customer service I have ever met. She is a people person and cheerful. She makes me happy driving a Hertz car.</Review>

< Review>
Rent a Jetta $45 for 2 days. Car wasn't ready when I arrived. It needed to be vacuumed. Car was decent. After returning the car, I asked if I can be dropped off. Since they will only take customers within 5 miles, they checked the address of where I'm going. They said I can't get a drop-off ride since it's 5.7 miles away. I asked her if they could just drop me at the 5 mile mark since .7 miles is a huge difference, I'll just walk from there. She told me she will try to get me a drop-off ride. She told me to just wait for the driver. I got a drop-off ride 10 minutes later. Royce was the driver. He was cool. He said .7 miles was no big deal. Thank you Royce. It would've been 5 stars if the female rep didn't give me a hard time.</Review>

Everyone that I interacted with was so nice and accommodating. Even though they were busy and there was a bit of a wait, every one of the staff kept their cool and was incredibly friendly to all of the customers. Honestly, it was a highlight of my trip and didn't mind waiting. I was just happy to be off the plane lol! Thank you again for your service, y'all.</review>

The only place we could get a car, it was during a holiday, but they worked with us. Not much of a selection because they don't have a big lot. Had issue because we ended up having to use them "long term".<//Review>

Went in to pick up an “economy car”.  When i got there i was told they didnt have any vehicles and that they were waiting for some customers to return. —- how long before they return. .... well, i dont know....
- finally the lady (assistant mgr or something like that) told me that she had two vehicles available but i had to pay an additional amount for those.
:-: Long story short;  i was given a bigger vehicle (a gas guzzler, Ram- with a Hemi) for the same price.

Upon return the same asst. manager lady person took me back to the dealership to pick up my car (less than a mile). SHE GOT LOST.

HERTZ needs to get better people that can run their rental offices.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I've rented cars before but never with Hertz. AAA gave a huge discount for booking with them so I couldn't possibly say no! I actually went to the wrong location and was running incredibly late however when I got there, they didn't rush me out or anything even though it was 10 minutes to close and they were almost going home for Thanksgiving. Instead, David patiently talked me through everything I needed to know about my rental and showed me the car. I was surprised to know they upgraded my rental at no additional cost to a much nicer car for no reason at all! It was the sweetest gesture and I'll never forget that! I will definitely come back again to this location for all future rentals thanks to their professionalism and kindness ^_^</text>

Hertz over sold at that locaton and there were a lot people expecting to get a car becaues we all had reservations. They were short on staff. The employees kept us up to date on how long it would take to get a car. I had to wait for about 2 hours for a car. But, they upgraded my car and took money off of my bill at the end due to the long wait.< /text>

Rented a car..called several times to confirm, no answer. Other location said they may not have any cars because they were busy last night.  I find it difficult to experience quality customer service anymore.  Back in the day, you booked a reservation and the company delivered on their word...not anymore.</Review>

Was my first time renting from this company and will be my last time. Tried to resolve an issue but the agents couldn't resolve it, so was given corporate number with the same results. Also find it Strange customer service number is 8am til 4pm, when other companies have it 24/7. I don't recommend renting from this place.<//Text>

<Review>They quoted me one price and when I got to the rental agency they gave me an entirely different price. It was over 90 more than originally quoted. Then they gave me a return  location of over 50 miles away and no offer to bring me home. When I told them at the counter that location would not work for me they told me to just return it to the location closet to my home. I did that and they charged my credit card $900 and they kept my $250 deposit! This was a huge mess! It took two weeks to get my money back. I would like to add that the only reason I got my money back was because I fought them all the way through an investigation..
I would not recommend this place to anyone.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

One of my coworkers required a rental while her car was being repaired. The repairs took longer than expected. Arrangements were agreed upon by Hertz this morning for her to keep the car one more day. The story from Hertz changed this evening, requiring her to return the car today before close of business. Not only did they deny having the conversation which I witnessed, they also threatened her with an additional $200.00 charge if the car was returned the following day, contradicting the agreement they made with her this morning. I think they should consider changing their name to Hurts Rent A Car.

Sincerely, friend of the victim</Text>

get double charged for a cleaning fee.
call to speak with the manager,  put on hold for like 5 mins then told he's gone for the day & wouldn't return until Monday.  was asked what the issue was and told them they charged me twice, they denied it. i say "really?! then how come there are two transactions on my bank statement??" they proceed to tell me "let me dig deeper & find out, whats your #?"
currently waiting on a call back. predicting they will disregard and leave for the day & not call me back because they close in an hour.
horrible customer service
should be no stars
*** just like i thought,  evade their mistake, then go home for the day.
this is how you do business?? BS< /review>

I've been here many times and today I show up to rent a car after having to leave my car at the dealer for service and I get a rude woman "helping" me. The car I want is completely clean and ready to go but she insists that it needs to be cleaned and that I wait 30 minutes which they've never made me do before.<//Review>

Went from 300 to 500 and they did not honor my reservation! Total Scam! Made reservation months ahead of time and when it come time to rent the car they say price has went from $296 to $500 and i cant get the car until the following day! Dont bother renting from them if the price looks good as they will bait and switch you. I plan on leaving negative reviews on many hertz and sending a letter to corporate.</text>

<Review>When I first went into this offiice, it was quite small, I was greeted, and the staff was friendly. One was busy helping the customer while the other was helping with another customer on the phone checking rates. They informed me that they will be with me as soon as possible. It was a good 10 minute wait, I was expecting for them to ask me if I had a reservation to move the process quicker. The rental process was decent, I think there was another individual working there who was helping another person move the fridge? But no point were taken off because of that, I don't think he had another computer or terminal to help me even if he wanted to. But, when lines got long at Enterprise, I do recall where an agent would walk me out with a couple of keys and inform me which car I would like to rent instead of having me just wait in a long line and to start the paperwork. The selection of the vehicle were limited to 1 of each of the category. I had put a hold on an intermediate which happened to be a Hyundai Elantra, when I did the walk around, it looks like it had been in a slight fender bender and the rear bumper was sticking out a little bit on the right rear wheel well. Yes just a little bit, but I did not the bumper to strip off while I was driving down the Highway at a constant speed for 5 hours plus. It has happened before so I informed them this vehicle is deemed hazardous so I will not accept this, maybe a little eye roll was given to me ... but safety is an issue to my family and I.

I was then given another alternative, which I am sure would have been the same price for a smaller size which is compact even though I paid for the upgrade for midsize which was for a Scion XA in which, I know I am unable to put my pregnant wife and a car seat for my child to sit comfortably.

To which I asked do you have any other vehicles, she said let me go back in and check, mind you the parking lot is very small. If you don't know the inventory of what seemed like 3-4 cars in the lot was a bit frustrating. So we go back and she said, we have a Toyota Camry, I said fine we will take that. In my mind, a free upgrade would be nice because the other vehicle didn't seem safe. She said it was going to be $15 more. I said can you make it $10, she said no at first, then asked her co-worker to which she obliged. I just didn't know it was going to be $10 a day.

In my mind Sonata, Elantra vs. Toyota Camry, same thing, didn't I reserve a Midsize, not a compact. I thought they could have handled this issue more professionally when I told them the car was unsafe. I asked about the oil and maintenance, tire pressure, etc and received a response of they get maintenance to their respective mileage, fair enough, I wanted to check the oil level but I don't think she was having it. So I rented the car the car runs great, funny thing was on my trip back home, the Maintenance light came on for a brand new Toyota Camry at 4689 miles or something. I was rather surprised.< /Review>< pics>

Slow service.  Make sure they actually take CLEAR and CLOSE UP pictures of any prior damage, they will try to blame you otherwise!  The last time I'm renting from this place.  Also don't ask them to pick you up, they are going to be significantly late.<//Text>

Hmmm?!  I guess this store is tired of refunds & exchanges?! Girl said that they email receipts instead. So receipt was not in my email the next day & when I looked up the store online,they didn't have no ph# listed for this store. Hmmm?! What to do. I don't know if it is their policy in emailing receipts but it's better to ask for paper.</Text>

<Text>We frequent footlocker, especially this location but today we had a very unpleasant situation. The so-called Manager Brandon watched my family and I walk in and refused to greet or even help us. We went to the kid section to pick out shoes for our youngest and Brandon stood on the opposite side watching me. I picked out two shoes for my son and realized we still hadn’t been helped. Brandon then walked right passed us and pretended to be helping someone else. We stood and waited for a bit looking around and noticed the other salesman busy with a customer yet Brandon was pretending to be busy and trying to create a conversation with people getting into line. At one point, my wife watched him standing still and avoiding eye contact. I got the attention of the other salesman who apologized and attempted to help us but at that point we were frustrated with our treatment so we left. We are platinum status and know the Head Manager Maalik at this location who has always been amazing. We have NEVER been treated with such disrespect. I would recommend training for Brandon on appropriate customer care and treatment. The store was not that busy and this could have been handled better.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Customer service sucks here, Torrance Delamo mall location. Two young black males with diamond studds in there ears to busy chasing take rather than make a sale completely ignored my son and I as I asked him a question staring at some chicks. I turned around and start walking out as he then ask me if I would like any assistance. I said no I'm fine, and spent my money at a different store.< /text>< gmap_id>

I wish I could give it no stars, today my sisters who are African American went there and were accused of stealing a shirt that they DIDN’T take, and were followed around the mall by one of their Caucasian employees who was off the clock. He went up to them and accused them of stealing, harassing them, and threatening them that he was going to call security and have them arrested. He finally left them alone after they said they did not take it, and my sisters offered him to call mall security to get their bag checked, but he declined and walked off saying racial slurs. I am beyond disappointed in Foot locker for hiring a racial profiling harassing angry Caucasian boy. I have tried to call multiple times to this location and the number does not work, I will be reaching out to corporate!!! I am angry, disappointed, and disgusted with this situation that happen to my sisters today. His name is Brayden who is the manager of the store, how could FootLocker higher a man like this. #BraydenRacistManager< /Review>

<Text>I love footlocker however I don't go to del amo footlocker a lot and I was very disappointed with the customer service. I got an adias jacket there and the cashier who helped me was very rude and had an attitude that did not make me want to come back and to top it all off she didn't take off the sensor and I don't have the receipt and now I'm barely noticing the sensor is on it and I can't wear the jacket now. I called to try to see if there was any possible way that I could get the sensor off and the girl said to check the other footlocker. Im very upset with the customer service I wish I had a better experience.</Text><Name>Julia Mangandi< /Name><date>1502830512130< /date><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b2c0649e621:0xa8690e9afc13d87c< /Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

<Review>First time at this restaurant and I was so grateful! I haven't had gooood Jamaican food since my D.C. days years ago and was fortunate to have found this spot on my LA visit. My order of jerk chicken was delicious, spicy, and nice and hot upon pick up! Will visit again soon.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKQK7U_3NvlGRj4WhzdYgm8Qo2VhXvOV8wLtDI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

My first time having Jamaican jerk chicken. I added some slice jalapenos. It was very good. Hot and spicy. I recommend trying out this place in Inglewood, Ca</Text>

Food is great, albeit a tad slow but i think this place will be better once we are able to eat inside. Jerk chicken was great and delicious.</Review>

<Text>This food was so good. I got a sampling of the small plates with sweet potato pudding, and it was all very "NICE." The small plates are very filling FYI, they packed them. The homemade pineapple ginger drink is definitely worth a try.< /Text>< response>

Whoa! Flavor bombs! This is exactly what Jamaican food should look, smell, taste and the temperature is juuuuuust right. I found this jewel after a popular Jamaican place in the valley was trash. I’ve lost count of my visits honestly. Great customer service from the patrons and their family members. It’s always refreshing to see a family provide excellent business and services as a unit. The Oxtail mini and a jerk patty are my faves but EVERYTHING is good on the menu. Trust me.< /Text>

🇯🇲 JAMAICA
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
Located a bit off of La Brea at the back of Hyde Park Plaza, Country Style is not reinventing the wheel, but based on the constant flow of people grabbing orders, they appear to be doing it right. They sell mini plates of most items that include rice and peas, but most people seem to be going for entree portions, sold in both small and large, that also add steamed vegetables, fried plantains, and a small piece of festival bread.< /Text>

All of it was bomb, only thing I'm not into spicy in my curry goat with spicy. But I was too hungry and it was too good, I ate through the spicy. Only 1  thing it could use a tab bit more seasoning but the meat fell off the bone it was tender. The staff is really nice and pleasant. Sorry no pics next time< /Text>< pictures>

Great food!!  But very small portions on the small combo. the taste is there and very flavorful , but It just didn't capture my fulness of apitite for more I don't know how the large looks, but hoping better and fuller. The festival bread was small and Mouth bite tasty hoping for. More and the steam veggies was good with nice food amount of seasoning. I but couldv and I been better.<//text>

<Review>Delicious! My son has been telling me about this place, and I finally tried it. It's soooo good! Better than "that other" ;). I got the curry goat with rice and peas, a side of calaloo, and sorrel to drink. First bite was of the calaloo, and it was PERFECT! The flavor was superb; little saltfish (I think) with the right amount of heat. Next was the goat; the texture was fresh, and so flavorful. Spicy! They use short grain rice for the rice and peas,which is better for the sauce. The festival was on the tiny side, but that's ok. And the sorrel?.PERFECTION!<//Review>< Date>

It was decent enough, when ordering a meal do not choose the festival as a side as it literally is one tiny tiny piece. Was super disappointed by that.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>We arrived in LA on Friday Sept 4th from Arizona, a brief 4-day holiday vaca. We were so looking forward to some delicious jerk chicken. The  first spot we visited was a complete disappointment we never got any food. So I would like to thank 'country style Jamaican restaurant' for their delicious food and great dependable customer service.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Excellent, affordable Jamaican food! I ordered the jerk chicken small plate with a side of potato salad, rice and plantains. Everything was delicious and with enough spice to get you moving but not enough to overpower. Definitely want to come back and try other menu items.<//Review>< pics>

Fast, friendly service. They will run out of patties so go early if that's what you want. I love Jamaican food they have massive flavor. No place taste exactly the same. Country Style Jamaican has explosive flavors, definitely a place you should try.</Review>

When you walked in, notice they are rocking Bob Marley music and see the poster of him and flag of Jamaica on the wall, you know you got into the right place! I was mind blown when first time having it. I got the curry goat! God, the meat melted right away in month. I savored thru the whole meal! Def will try every item on the menu!!!<//Review>< pics>

<review>I love Jamaican food but I haven't had it much since moving to LA. The places I've found didn't have great reviews and I'm picky. I finally took a chance today... totally worth it. The food here is great, and they deliver. I had curry chicken with festival and a chicken pattie. Everything was flavorful. Definitely will get food from here again. Great experience!</review>< pics>

Been here twice. Best jerk chicken outside of Jamaica itself, but everything here hits the spot. Took my mother-in-law who is born and raised in Kingston and she had the curry goat and gave it the official Jamaican sign off. Staff are real courteous. 100% 5/5 will be back!<//Text>

<Review>The wait was worth it. Large servings. I had to eat the rest for dinner. Price was $15 for the large plate. I will be going back probably later in the week. I want to try the jerk chicken and the oxtails out.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><userid>111203775925538775224</userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2b760ce197337:0xd97ef6b690d4d947</Gmap_id>< date>

Let me start by saying as soon as I walked in to country style jamaican restaurant I felt welcome not uncomfortable that's a plus already. Damien who waited on me was very cool for this was my first time trying this spot. The oxtails were tender the food was pretty good. They showed me love with the portions👍🏽. I will definitely be returning along with my fam and friends</Text>

I like this store, its pretty clean and the workers are very nice. Im surprised the mens section has some pretty good cloths especially jackets, socks and underwear items. Also love their little garden and car section you'd be surprised what you'll find<//Review>

I had Ashley, the sales associate do a return transaction for me. Her customer service is very poor. She had a bad attitude the whole time. she told me I could not return items with no tags, but for the one of the shirts I was returning, I was told I am able to return it even it was originally missing the price tag. She did not carefully reference the items on the receipt and sternly stated one item does not match the description. Lady, you are looking at wrong item on the receipt! Another lady, I am assuming is the manager came over to assist. She also told me I could not return as well until I pointed out the item description on the receipt to her. In the end she approved the refunds and I was issued my money back. Ashley shoved the receipts to me and in a nasty tone said, "Bye~~!!" It was a, "You are not worth my time, get out of my face," kind of attitude.

I used to enjoy shopping here, but now the customer service has gone down hill. If I could, I would not give any stars.< /text>

<Review>Very rude curly haired hispanic girl who yelled at me for coming in the store with a return bag. I was not aware that I had to do the return first before shopping, she could have told me in a professional manner but lacked the customer service skills. She was very hostile and made me feel very uncomfortable. I expected better from my favorite Ross location.<//Review>< username>

TRASH BAG experience.

I really like this store, they usually have good collection compared to other ROSS stores around but today (01/13/2020) I was there and while I was checking out they said they ran out of bags so they offering trash bags. I mean TRASH BAGS, really. It's the management's fault that they did not order the bag on time so they ran out of it. But just imagine you are coming out of store with a Trash Bag. It is so funny and sad.<//text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>You can always find good deals at Ross. Found mens Levi pants for $22-24 each. When we were at Sears 10 min earlier, Levies were on Sale buy one get one 50% off but each pair of pants was $60. Saved ourselves about $50. The line was long but not too long of a wait, they had plenty of cashiers and they were fast and good customer service.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Very very bad experience. Remember there is restroom,  but The restroom is not available for customers every time you went to the store . Just go other Ross instead of this one in Southland mall.<//Review>

Not sure why I go back.  About once a year I go to Ross with renewed optimism that things will have improved.  I went within the 1st two hours they were open on New Years day and the racks were still well organized.  Got my items went to check out there was a line with 3 people in it and the normal que that snakes around so I start to follow it and then I realize that there isn't a cashier.  So I back up past  and go to the other line passing an employee switching out displays.  I patiently wait when two other people get in line with me so that are now 6 people in this line.  After about 5 minutes the employee switching out displays says that line is for returns only.   I point out there was only one cashier and she said I can open up and 6 or the 7 people now in line went over to her.   She announces that they are out of bags.  Hopefully things will improve in the next year.</text>

< Review>
Bad management.  Waited in line for over 30 mins . Long line and only 1 register working the other cashier was playing with hangers . The supervisor was there taking her sweet time closing out another register.  I want to call corporate office so bad to file a complaint but decide not to . But yes it was very frustrating waiting in line with around 20 customers with 4 employees and only one was working.<//Review>

Take too long to get to the cashier to pay,( about 1:20 minutes) they have to move faster or hire more people.< /review>

Variety of lotion skin care and body care section are very little. Also, I cannot believe that the store has little manpower for cashiers. The check out waiting line was ridiculous long.</Text>

<time>1574566664894</time><rating>2</rating><text>This a a big store, you can find almost anything you expect to by in any ross store. Customer service and counters need so much improvement. At one time there was only one cashier for 28+ people waiting for checkout, she was a bit slow but you cannot blame her. Working by yourself with no help in a big ross store on a weekend makes you tires and slow. The management probably does not care about customers and the traffic in the store.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

< review>
I was pregnant I had an emergency to urinate and I asked the person in charge to allow me to use the bathroom that was an emergency and she answered me in a very rude way saying no.  I had to endure until I reached other baths and after urinating I felt a pain to endure the desire.  They are bad people.  I had never asked to go to the bathroom because I know they don't lend it but because of the pregnancy I had a lot of need and they treated me badly.  I don't want to know anything about that store I still remember and I'm sad that employees treat the customer like that.</review>

Went looking for a pair of men's house shoes and not one pair in the whole place. I did find a great buy on men's socks, 10 pair for $9.99. Not to bad and not a waisted trip.< /Text>

The manager at this store is awesome and is a true asset to the Ross company. I've been coming in this and the Castro valley store for years and the last 6 months have been a real positive change in this store.. Thanks for the great shopping experience</review>

I'm sorry but I do not shop at the Southland Mall ROSS STORE.  I was there xmas eve shopping. It was almost time for the stores to close. There were 5 employee's standing up in front talking to each other. There was only ONE(1) person working the checkout counter. The line was very long. I noticed one worker helped One(1) customers out. But then went back to talking to the other employee's. I was very upset. It seems only person who cared about there job was the only girl working the registers. I shop at the Fremont Hub Ross & the Ross in Newark in the same parking lot as Safeway. Both are NICE & CLEAN. I found a beautiful black patent leather GUESS PURSE.  In The picture I took the black was so shinny you can't make out that its a purse.. Love it.💓😎🌴< /text>

<Review>This is not a Ross that I like to shop at but since Ross always have good stuff for super cheap, I come and see if this one has anything good. But most of the time I come here, there's nothing really good. The staff never asks if you need help, never get greeted. Things are always so messy, and dirty. They def need more friendly staff that knows how to keep the place nice and clean. The lines are always long because the cashiers rings people up SUPER slow. So by the time it gets to me, I don't even feel like buying anything anymore.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

It was so bad, the manager named Sara is so rude, she snatched a 2.99 toy from my 3 year old daughter just because she ripped it a little and the manager didn't even know if i was going to buy it, I've always gone to this store and I have never experienced this discrimination, I couldn't believe my eyes that this person was so rude to my baby girl.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I already gave you a review if this is the one that is in a Mall in San Leandro I tell you that I had a bad experience there because it does not have a bathroom available to the public a store that currently has more than 300 people inside on the weekend. close and the employee shows us everything rudely the one who works that day in the fitting room and said that only the bathrooms were for the employees I suggest that they fire her I do not plan to go there again I do not give a star

(Translated by Google) They do not lend you the bathroom
You have to leave the store to find a bathroom and go back to shopping, they always say it is out of order
That is very inconvenient and more if you bring children

No te prestan el baño
