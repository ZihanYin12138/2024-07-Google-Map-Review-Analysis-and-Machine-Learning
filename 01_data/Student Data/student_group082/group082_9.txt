<review>In the words of my bank, "be careful who you do business with" and that is exactly right.
The owner of this establishment is an absolute crook. I say this after pursuing every avenue and verifying that they will not work with us regardless of the circumstances which are not in their favor.
We purchased a pistol in April and were awaiting the ten day period when they call us a couple days later saying that the dmv rejected the application. We called back within 2 hours to let them know that this was not a big deal and that we could clear that up no problem when they informed us that they had already sold OUR pistol that we paid for.
When we received the refund it was short by over $200 so naturally we reached back out and they tell us this is a "restocking fee"  What an epic joke for several reasons. First of all, it took them about 20 minutes to even locate the pistol the first time. Secondly, they did no level of restocking in any sense of the word. They literally sold it right out from under us within an hour without so much as an apology and then they refuse to refund us claiming that their "store policy" is to steal 20% of your money for absolutely no reason and slap the term "restocking fee" on it to make it seem legit.
In any case they tell us that it is posted "all over" including on the receipt. Well, no it's not. It's not in a single place on any of the receipts so there's the first lie.
Such bad business, unbelievably crooked way to make a quick buck. They apparently like to make their customers stay on edge and feel like they need to carefully comb thru every piece of writing in the establishment to ensure they don't get screwed over.
I would also like to note that they charge LITERALLY DOUBLE what any other gun shop charges for ammo. $50 for 50 rounds of 9mm. Their pistols are also about $200 over other shops<//review>< Pics>

I called the shop after hearing a couple of positive reviews from buddies. They had something in stock that I wanted to purchase (paid in full and not ammo) over the phone. I couldn’t make it to the store until a couple days later because I’m an hour away. I was told that if I was an existing customer, they would proceed with the purchase but since I hadn’t been to the store before, they wouldn’t. Wow, I guess you don’t want any new customers. I guess I’ll take my business elsewhere. Just because guns and ammo are a hot commodity right now, doesn’t mean you should treat potential new customers poorly.< /Text>

<review>I traveled to the Stage Stop to do a private party transfer. It was about a 40 minute drive and it turned out to be well worth it. They actually had a good selection of guns with a solid inventory of parts accessories and ammo. I completed my transfer and took a closer look at there Henry rifles. I found the exact model I have been looking for. which I would have had to order from one of my local shops. Their price was fair, i just got cash for my transferred gun so i squeezed the trigger. In addition they had some Savage magazines that  I wanted in stock, some trigger expanders for my single action revolvers and 17HMR ammo at a decent price.  Their salesman started my paperwork as another salesman was finishing up the transfer forms with the buyer. This enabled me to complete both transactions at the same time. In conclusion, their service was top notch. The inventory was excellent for the current situation we are now dealing with. I will be returning to the Stage Stop for any future gun consideration as they deserve it.  Well done.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80916b9d54b260bf:0xb48e6180cdfc7d4f< /Gmap_id><date>1605607331260</date>< Rate>

<Review>Love the staff, can't praise them enough. They have great selection of ammo and firearms.

My only issues it with the range($$$ too much, $20 for ONE HR)
ITS SO HOT, each time I go back I expect it to be fixed. It's not.. I constantly have to wipe the sweat from my face, also breathing in the gun smoke..
Last time I came here I brought my own portable battery fan, glad they didn't see me because I felt a little embarrassed 😅.. I will keep coming back but I will be better prepared the next few times ..</Review>< Pics>

Great service. Great prices. Great people. Archery customer service is second to none. Drew helped me for over an hour, setting my bow up, gave me advice and tips for shooting at their archery range. They have an indoor range, 25 yards, for firearms too.</text>

Well, i kept hearing good things about this place, so today i woke up early got my 2500 dollars cash ready to buy a handgun and a membership. I took my wifey around 12 or 1pm so she can pick out a handgun, i was asking for another specific gun which the staff said they cant get and didnt bother to show me other alternatives, guess they are not interested in selling. After the desk guy said he cant get any guns, he just stared at me then i kept looking at the guns in display and he walked away. I have bought all my guns in Fresno and i use their range also and i guess i will continue going to Fresno. If you feel you can help us out im still willing to do business  with you guys, just tell me when to call and who to speak to specifically</review>

<response>{'time': 1545327779123, 'text': "Hello Luisa - we are sorry to hear about your unsatisfactory visit.  We do take each review seriously and reviewed our camera footage in order to discuss this with the employees directly.  We believe what may have happened is that when one of our employees initially walked up, he noticed your brother speaking with one of our other employees as he was helping another customer and assumed the other employee was already helping your brother.  At this time, you were off looking at clothing and watching a young boy running around and the interaction may have been missed. When there are multiple customers at the counter, it is difficult for employees that have just walked up to determine who was next and they will generally ask. Sometimes we do get it wrong and we apologize for that but we assure you, it was not intentional nor was it because of how you were dressed. We would love another opportunity to earn your business and show you that the good reviews you've heard about us are not incorrect."}</response><Gmap_id>0x80916b9d54b260bf:0xb48e6180cdfc7d4f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<time>1504218280162</time><Rating>3</Rating><text>First and foremost the staff is top tier... Knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and fast service. Why I knocked off two star's was because one their gun range has what seem to me poor ventilation. I had to step back after I shot off a mag(10 rounds- AR15) because I would be breathing all the stagnent gun smoke(i shot about 200 rounds). The second star I knocked off because it was so hot in there it was uncomfortable to shoot. I am not exaggerating as soon as I walked in there I started sweating, another customer that was in there his shirt was completely soaked. I will continue to be a customer for my firearms needs but I will go else where to shoot my AR.<//text>< pics>

< review>
Been here two separate times, Both visits were very similar. The first visit we waited 45 minutes to buy 4 boxes of ammunition. Customer service was poor. When we visited today we called before hand to drop off a bow. Upon entering we were not acknowledged, my husband went straight to the bow counter with our toddler and waited while I browsed the store. All the employees were helping one customer behind the gun desk, and paid no attention while we waited for them to stop chatting. Finally the lady asked if we had already been helped after our toddler was getting loud..and a few dirty looks were shot our way. Needless to say we walked out without purchasing anything and will not be returning with any future buisness.<//review>

Bill Bennison is an asset to this company and his staff is nothing short of exceptional. My wife, who is most critical, was equally impressed.
Short story: Family drama (bs) about my fathers belongings and 3 guns, brought me to this shop. From the first phone interaction to the end of the transaction, (mind you this was a Sunday) was next level stuff. I really am dumb when it comes to guns and such, but these guys treated you like a friend. If your thing is guns and such, you owe it to yourself to visit. I will return with Starbucks next week for these guys....Thanks again! EC</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>First time there my first impression not a bad store. Had a gun range and archery range and few select of fishing products. I went there because it was more convenient for me to do a 2 gun transfer with my uncle. A taurus85 and xd40 with 2 mags. After papers all done we left. While on the road home they called saying they gave us wrong copy and to go back to get the right copy so we turned back. While we was on the way back they called back again and said I did have the right copy so we basically turned around for no reason. Ok no biggie right? It happens. Well 10 days later I went to pick up my 2 guns the taurus 85 and xd40. While I was there they recheck paperwork identification and proof of second address. All good. Then the guy goes well let me just double check the guns make sure everything is right. Ok I get it. Then I noticed he just let me signed the form that states did buyer show basic knowledge of gun function and safety without me actually showing him so i was like ok??? But just then he turns and takes my guns to the other side of the counter and inspects my guns not in front of me but away from me. I thought that was weird. After that he locks my guns up and came back to me and says you're all done. In my mind im like ok??? Again weird. You didnt atleast let me personally see the guns that im picking up. So something was telling me to check the case myself which I was inside the store but didn't and was guna check after I got to my car but figured safer at home so i left. I should have checked my gun inside the store when the guy didn't let me see what's inside the case when he was checking. There was only 1 mag for my xd40. I was like I swore there supposed to be 2. So i called my uncle to double check sure enough there was supposed to be 2 mags. I had forgot after waiting 10 days but when I opened the case it just didn't look right and all my suspicion were right on track they had took my extra mag like low lives. I couldn't believe it. I was guna call and complain but figure be no point it be my words against theirs so instead ima leave this review. I wondered why he didn't want me to show him if I knew how the gun function when I signed that form. And when he checked my gun in tje case away from me. The whole time he didn't want me to see what wasnt inside til i got home. They got me but for 1 mag man I mean come on how scandalous you get. I was guna try their range but nope not no more. That was my first time there and will be my last. I hope they see this review. The rest of yal be careful and check your items carefully. Save the trouble and go to Turlock Alquist Arms. 5 stars there.

Update.... Ok sorry for the inconvenience but we have found the last mag my uncle had misplaced it. Honest mistake and sorry for all the confusion. Sorry it took so long to report back to this review. I gave it a 3 star considering the other mishaps. Stage did call me regarding my issue and also stated if I wanted to check the video footage of the transaction which i denied cuz I believe it was probably a whole misunderstanding and unfortunate event. Sorry Stage Stop it was my honest mistake and I apologize.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

The cashier Mishal was the sweetest and most professional worker!! She checked out 3 of my family members and myself and was super helpful. Also the store was great, clean and not packed, definitely worth it.</text>

Pretty good selection of big & tall shorts. Changing rooms are a little dirty and there's a fair amount of clothing on the ground from people not putting stuff on the rack correctly. Other than that, the staff are friendly and the lines moved pretty quick.</review>

<review>The store looks very ghetto on the outside and they have limited 3 entrances now down to one entrance the store is very disorganized there is known nice fixture manikin and is just thrown together. Not to mention the merchandise reflects the store. I had complained numerous times to corporate and nobody has come in to clean up that store<//review><Rating>1</Rating>< date>

While At the Redlands store i witness a heated conversation between the cashier Curry and the floor manager La Sal they were both rude and UN professional and disrespectful towards a customer. I say that to say this, while a disagreement was going on with the manager the cashier and a customer, the cashier kept interrupting the conversation between the customer and manager. Finally the customer said i am talking to him (the floor manager) The manager then step up to the customer and got close enough into the customer space, as if a person getting ready to strike or fight. It seemed like he was about to strike her. This happened 5/27/17 between 12:30pm and 1:05pm. This was UN professional, very rude and very disrespectful. Never will i shop at this store again.<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Tonight 01/02/2020 was my first time at this great clips location, the first location I was at I had waited over 30 plus minutes and then was told I would have to wait another 45mins.. so I up and left and came here and was instantly greeted with smiles and welcomes, Tamarra did my hair and OMG she is absolutely AMAZING! I showed her two pictures of something I was going for and she did exactly what i was wanting! She was very patient, understanding and gave her honest opinion and I'm so blow away by the ending results! I had super long hair and was nervous about going short but tamarra seriously knocked it out and blew my mind and was even so patient with my 5 and 3 year old asking so many questions! I will only go back to her from now on!!! Tamarra I hope you see this and know you are amazing and knocked my new style out like a rock star.. thank you thank you thank</Review><Response>{'time': 1578088363290, 'text': 'Thank you for coming in, Samantha!

<text>I recently had to find a new place to get my haircuts. The place i used to go to is closed by the time i get off work. I tried about 6 different places over the past 4 months and kept getting bad haircuts. Then i came here and finally got a GREAT haircut. Thanks to Brooke. Will definitely be back.</text><user>116626478955303649020<//user><Rate>5</Rate><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x809ac65e82889807:0x7e4607f68837146d<//gmapID>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This was my first time to this specific location. I've never given any kind of review due to the fact that my haircuts at other places have been ok. But! I gotta say I loved the way my hair cut turned out. It was just a simple long bob, but I loved how it framed my face nicely due to the fact that the hair stylist knew exactly what she was doing. If you're thinking about trying out a new place for a haircut, I would highly recommend Great Clips on Sheldon. And ask for Brooke. She is just awesome! Also, the people there were friendly and welcoming.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1515594831679, 'text': 'Thank you for coming in!

<text>Just moved back to Sacramento area and needed to find a good hair shop. I was kind of hesitate on going great clips because I usually go to barbershops. Got my haircut from Brooke, she was friendly and gave me a nice cut for a cheap price . I will probably be going back here for future hair cuts.<//text>< pictures>

Cut way to high above one ear and left long hairs sticking out obove the other ear. And she couldn't even get the fade right. It looks bad. I had to get a second hair cut the next day at a different location. Don't go to this loction on Sheldon</text></record></dataset><record>

Went in and showed the guy a front, side, and back photo of a layered bob A-line. He unevenly hacked my already jacked up hair (in hospital for major surgery and recovery took 5 months--my hair got ruined and I needed to start over.) What I walked out with was an uneven bowl cut, no layers, and my hair looks WORSE. I would've been better off shaving it all off. I left horrified.< /review>

The lady (I won't give her appearance out, not to get her fired, though arguably, she deserves to be fired) who gave me a haircut instead of focusing on her job of giving me the haircut I want - she began to multitask, spent a few minutes talking to her co-workers while giving me a haircut - half of her attention on my hair and the other half on her co-workers. After she finished talking to them, she switched to me and tried SO HARD to relate to me... to get a dang tip.

In the end I'm left with unevenly cut hair, one side has more hair cut than the other side and I'm left with a bad mood. I don't care where your daughter goes to school and who she is majoring for, give me a quality hair cut and I might consider giving you a tip. Actions, not words, please!

Very unprofessional, I would give them a 0 out of 5. And they charged me 15$... It's awful.

At this, my rant is over but my rage lives on.

<Text>I usually go to great clips.  They usually have great customer service, hair cutters, etc. but this one is absolutely horrible, closing 1 hour before sevice time they turned so many people down and before saying "we had online people" there only a few people about 3 in the place.

I always go to Great Clips whenever I need to clean up my facial hairs and as well as getting trimmed. Nikki is a great Barber, she listen to you and gives you exactly what you want. Great Barber Shop.<//review>

<Review>Absolute nightmare of a company. Too many reasons to list. Customer service is no help!! All reviews are true. Please do your research before going with this company. I am owed 18k from them and no one seems to know how to help me. I will have to file a lawsuit.

I have been trying to get my taxes paid for over two months. The company acknowledged this was their mistake and they would pay the late fees; instead they took MY money out of my escrow account for their mistake. They also have not adjusted my escrow payment and I have provided them the documentation several times for months. I would NEVER recommend this mortgage company to anyone.</text>

This place is absolutely terrible, i am owed a check from this company for $659.03. They refuse to give it to me after speaking to not one but 4 supervisors. I have been trying to get it for 2 months now and the last supervisor promised me it was shipped out March 16. I called back Friday April 2nd to them telling me they hadn’t sent it out and don’t know when they will. Normally I wouldn’t care but I lost my job due to covid 19 and my wife getting sick so I was really relying on this check to make my March 1st mortgage. I called February 16th to let them know I lost my job and really needed that check to make my March 1st payment. It never came, not only did they lie to me, I got a late fee and the worst of all I got a 30 day late on my credit over something I tried to handle weeks in advance of my payment. So needless to say this company is terrible. I am owed this money and have the paper work to prove it. I know I won’t get the check because months have passed it’s just sad how they would do this. I even asked if they could just apply it toward my mortgage and they refused, this money is owed to me and they won’t release it, I’m transferred all around and hung up on. At this point it’s just a lost cause. I guess they need the $659.03 more then I do. The worst customer service i have ever experienced. PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING AND ISSUE MY CHECK. My name is Seth Timmons, be sure to call me once you read my review.

Not Thank You..<//Review>

They are impossible to get answers from, customer service is rude, don't even try to get in touch with the special loans department.... the list goes on and on.

<text>I would give minus stars if this were an option.  Terrible company.  We have been trying to close on a house for 2+ months with the closing date having to be extended yet again - at least the 4th time.  Always something to avoid actually closing...need more documents, new documents, underwriting is reviewing, always an excuse.  RUN from these people<//text>< pics>

<text>DON’T USE THIS COMPANY!!! I hate to give bad news but I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. The worst experience ever. Sent them documents time and time again. The closing documents were incorrect 4 times. Charged us for things that were already paid for:( closing date was pushed almost 30 days late. Then when we actually started closing at 3pm it took 3 hours for them to get it correct.</text>< rating>

Horrible lender. Literally one of the worst lenders I have ever dealt with in 18 years of lending. We have an account rep that disappears and our inside person has a phone number that has been disconnected. Let our borrower show up to a closing and nobody communicated to us that it wasnt happening until we called them for 7th time day of closing.

I would not recommend them under any circumstance. I have written two books on mortgages on Amazon and I can assure you they will get blasted an example of what not to do as a mortgage lender.

I wish I could give them negative stars thats how bad these people are at their job. They dont even deserve a positive reveiw allowance<//text>

Very bad loan servicing service. Always slow to answer calls, and when they do answer nobody knows anything or how to help you. When we refinanced our loan they were not supposed to charge us for 1 month and they did anyways. When we looked for information about COVID they submitted and application for this even though we called and told them like 20 times we didn’t want it. This whole time it has been a mess with them, thank goodness we switched lenders.< /text>

Not many lenders could get you into a home with a not so perfect credit score and a high DTI especially during a pandemic... but nations did it, and in record time! They were responsive, courteous and really do care about their clients. Thank you guys for making our dream of home ownership come true even in these troubling times <3<//Review>

I fell on hard times and I was in contact with them and provided all the documents needed and also email to let me know as soon as possible if there were anything missing so I could get it to them. Everytime I called which was once a week each time I was told I need documents and a few times it was the same ones i had provided. I was able to get all the money i needed to be current on my payments. About a week later i get a package in the mail saying my hardship was denied due to lack of documents. The best part the paperwork was dated for the 4th of Feb but yet somehow it was posted dated for the 11th of Feb. Meaning they said it was sent the 4th when really it was sent the 11th. This company is trash and their customer service is worst than trash. Avoid this lender at all cost. I will also be reporting them to the Veterans Affairs.<//review>

<Time>1551495844347<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I am the listing Realtor and the buyer was using this company.  This company is completely unethical if not unlawful.  After talking with legitimate lenders - they all said this lender was legally required to close the loan for their buyer.  But they refused - they kept throwing unnecessary conditions to the buyer.  The result is the buyer is homeless - the seller who was told we had the OK to close and quit their job to move to another state is now in financial hardship.  This wasn't a million dollar deal - this was a regular deal with real regular folks who depend on companies following the law.  If you are a buyer - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY -  if you are a Realtor - DO NOT ACCEPT AN OFFER FROM A BUYER USING THIS COMPANY!  They have ruined the lives of 2 parties with no consideration.  I am really not sure how they can sleep at night operating this way and I will be completely surprised if the buyer doesn't take legal action.</text>< Pics>

Our wholesale team is phenomenal!  They've helped us pull off some mortgage miracles and we've gotten a number of 5 star lendingtree reviews as a result.  Underwriting usually takes 24 hours or less and conditions are cleared in a matter of hours.  Our target market is in the low 600s and Motive makes these loans easy, often closing our FHA loans in less than 30 calendar days!  The underwriting team is responsive and always available, our account manager quickly resolves any issues, and the closers make things easy for our title companies and borrowers.  Motive has earned our pipeline and deserves yours.  Thank you!< /text>

I can't speak on the whole of the company, but I can speak on Tuan Tu. We were on a time crunch with being in our new home, selling our current home, and refinancing an investment property. With Tuan's patience and drive we were able to close on the new purchase in 18 days. I was a handful to work with and he handled it well. I see the bad reviews but I guess it really depends on who you work with. Thanks to Tuan and his team for getting us closed on time.<//text>

Ask for Tuan Tu for the Best of the Best !!!

He was very helpful and made my refinancing stress free, which was my worst fear when Refinancing. I am a busy mother who works over 40 hours a week. Not to much on my end that i had to do. Everything that was told to me from the star was the truth 100% to the end.
THANK YOU Tuan Tu!!! He is as good as its gets!!!</Review>

I have been working with Motive Lending for several years now,  from being a loan originator myself to becoming a Mortgage Broker/ Company owner.  It is all too often that it was the incompetence of the loan officer a customer may have been working with vs. the lender itself. In my industry, its common to try and throw someone else under the bus when it was likely  the oversight, or incompetence of the loan originator.  Motive lending  gets it done for our clients and always has.  Often, when others banks said no, Motive  Lending makes the possibility of home ownership  available to many that would otherwise not qualify. Always within a pretty swift turn time from start to finish.   I trust my business and the business of my clients to them wholeheartedly,< /Text>

I would like to share my experience with Nations Direct Mortgage company.  When I lost hope with other lending companies that gave me the run around with no results.  Tuan Tu of Nations Direct Mortgage gave me hope he took his time and reviewed my loan and provided me with better rates and great service. Tuan and Cassie did a great job . Contact Tuan Tu he will go the extra mile to make sure your needs are met..... Thanks again Pearl F<//Text>

Tuan Tu at Nations Direct Mortgage made the process of refinancing unbelievable painless and easy! Never have I had such a quick process involved in a loan or refinancing and Tuan made it so effortless on my part. He kept to his word, would call or email after hours if I had questions about the loan or process, and was incredibly knowledgeable! He was very personable and never seemed bothered with my questions nor the fact that I was taking up more of his time. He never rushed me off the phone or made me feel like he was too busy which I find rare in this business. I would recommend Tuan Tu and Nations Direct Mortgage to anyone looking to refinance or to find a mortgage lender and if I could give more than 5 stars I would! :) I highly recommend Tuan, his company, and his team!<//Text>

BEWARE!!! DO NOT USE THIS TRASH COMPANY!!! They simply do not care about the customer or any other business professional involved in the process. They completely botched my appraisal process to the point where I had to personally pay $100 out of pocket for an expedited appraisal just to try to get the deal done in time. Motive you owe me $100. Also their "team managers" are a joke, unprofessional, incompetent, and terrible communicators. The mortgage broker that I am using had to call their vice president after a week of ignored calls and emails just to get a response on the progress of the mortgage. All in all this is just another greedy bank trying to prey on American home buyers. They should be embarrassed of themselves.</Text>

The most incompetent and unprepared operation I have ever dealt with. They were completely unable to provide a comprehensive list of documents required and kept asking for more and more. They had typos in the requests they sent the IRS, could not get a deal done in 6 weeks.

If they do they are hoping to be in the mortgage business for a living, it will probably not work out for them. They should get another gig, maybe flipping burgers...< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Unprofessional and rude customer service. If you are trying to reach a real person do not input you loan number or phone number just wait until it automatically transfers you. They use the information you input at the beginning of the phone call to determine what department to transfer you to. I imagine if your account was past due they would use this to transfer you to collections automatically. Representative with initials DCR (refused to provide ID number) tried to rush me off of the phone and was condescending throughout. Generally a negative experience.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcde8c8b355e8d:0xe0371e610ec960d7<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If I could give this company zero stars I would. They are 100% unprofessional.  There is not good communication with this company they tell you one thing one day and then the next day it’s different and then they ask for things that are almost nearly impossible to do and that cost a lot of money and then tell you to go get something else done which defeats the purpose of getting the first thing done. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!  If you do you’ll probably regret it  when you lose the house that you really want.</text>

Switched accounts for my personal banking. Spoke to the CSR's at NDM 3 times so far to explain the delay in getting my electronic ACH payments set up again and not one of them actually documented my call or understood what I said. Continual phone calls all day long at work interrupting my day after the issue had already been resolved. Never the same person. No one followed through with updating the account. SUPER frustrating and made me very concerned with the lack of organization. No options for weekly payments and fast pay offs like other mortgage companies. No actual website for information unless you log in as a customer. Poor e-presence. This is my 4th house, and first time I have felt so disconnected from my lender. Definitely no personal service. Unfortunate.<//Review>

If zero stars was an option I would choose it!!!! If you're a first time homebuyer, DON'T COME HERE! If you wanted to be guided and have all the paperwork explained to you DON'T COME HERE!
If you want to get a yelled at and told, "I WISH I NEVER TOOK THIS FILE!! I SHOULD HAVE NEVER HELPED YOU!!" Then this is the place for you! If you want to get harassed about getting paperwork back to them when it's only been 20 minutes and you're at work and they know it! Then come on downnnn!!!
It all started April 7th of 2017 when I called Scott Lee and asked for information on buying a house and what we needed to do! Meanwhile we were about to be moving into a rental cause we were just inquiring on what we should prepare for when we want to buy. Well!!! When talking to Scott he can talk so fast you don't even know what he's saying! Next thing you he asks about our credit scores. I told him they weren't the greatest but, we will get them higher by next year. He ran our credit right there over the phone and said, "I've handled worse." So, after hearing those words I got so excited cause he then asked if we wanted to go look at house the following day!! I was over joyed cause I didn't think it would be possible!! Welllllll don't believe them when they say they've handled worse!! June 23rd was our original closing date for this house we fell in love with! We put our earnest money down and paid for our appraisal! Every single time we got closer to closing there was one more thing they needed! Literally everytime!!! Whether it was more money we needed or more paperwork we needed! Finally got to sitting down at the closing table with the seller and their relator; ours didnt come cause the guy Scott recommended got fired from Remax. While sitting from 2:30 pm to 6:30 pm waiting and wondering why we havent closed NO HAS ANSWERS!! We couldn't get a hold of the lenders (Nations Direct), we seriously didn't get an answer from anyone over there! And Nations Direct is in California so, they are 3 hours behind!!! So, FINALLY they decide to tell us that our debt to income ratio needs to be changed. So, Scott said he just needed to change some details with our homeowners insurance. The sellers relator, title company, and the sellers got first hand of how unprofessional Scott was when we were all sitting at the closing table. He was screaming at my husband over the phone when my husband wasn't yelling!! They could hear him from across the table! And they all said that they have never heard someone so rude and degrading in this type of business!! Wellll it still wasn't over!! They then said we need to pay off $1500 in credit cards!! Or put $3300 more into our account!!!! Well we did what he said and paid the credit cards down and guess what?!?!? They said our credit score wasn't high enough like it was gonna change over night!! WHY WOULD A PROFESSIONAL MORTGAGE BROKER ALLOW US TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS PROCESS IF WE NEVER WERE GOING TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?! totally uncalled for!! We got our denial letter from the lenders...guess what??? It was our credit scores that were dated from April 7th!! So, both parties were aware of our credit scores from the get go!! We don't deny that our scores were low but, would you pass up an offer of someone telling you that buying a house is possible?? Well now we are back to square one and need to find a rental!! We had April all the way through August wasted!!! and just so you know whenever something goes wrong in the process Scott makes it seem like it's your fault! He never owns up to anything! The best part was when we called Remax to get our earnest money back and they had no idea that the deal wasn't going through cause Scott never told them!! It was a week after we were suppose to close! Communication sucks on that end!! Both company's are crooked!<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>If I could give less than one star to Motive Lending I would.  Motive Lendind has caused nothing but stress and anxiety to my self and the buyer of my condo.  I am selling my condo FSBO.  I have agreed to pay the non reacuuring  closing costs.  The buyer of my condo is using Motive lending.  Motive lending locked the buyers interest rate at 3.65% with no points.  I feel as though Motive Lending has done a "bate and switch", because on the day we were supposed to close they sent the closing disclosure with a charge of 1.83 points (since this is a non reacuuring closing cost I would have to pay the points) , as well as incorrect funds required by the buyer to close.  They were informed of this mistake immediately and today, 2weeks later they finally sent new closing disclosures with no correction to their egregious errors. BTW, I am also in escrow on a house.  The proceeds from the sale of my condo are to be used for the down payment on my house.  As a result of their errors, and slow response to make corrections I have now incurred additional fees to extend the rate lock on the purchase of my house.  I am deeply disappointed with the complete incompetence displayed on the part of Motive Lending and their associates.   As it stands now if they don't make these corrections, between my rate lock extension and the 1.83 Points I will incurr additional costs of around $5700.  We still have yet to complete this transaction so I can't say they won't right their wrongs.  However, I would still warn any consumer, If you are thinking of using Motive Lending RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

If you're looking for a group of uneducated, unprofessional mortgage loan underwriters that don't know how to push paper, this is the place for you. They DO NOT know how to process paperwork to finance a construction loan to a mortgage loan whatsoever. DO NOT bother giving them information since they can't seem to keep track of it.</text>

<Text>I remember when the Iron Door opened in 1970, and I had to sit on the bench, outside while my folks celebrated the grand opening...thirty years later, I worked there,  absolutely the most fun I've ever had at work. Today, the Iron Door is cleaner than I've ever seen it, and they still have the coldest beer in the desert....</Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Best bar in town! Bar tenders made us feel right at home, try the pickled eggs and ask about the history. Great place and great people. I'll always stop in when in the area, just make sure to bring only cash.<//text></record>

Awesome little gem seemingly in the middle of no where. Serves the desert rats/OHV folks. Bartender was great, he was only there until 6pm. Cash only. Would be 5 stars if there was even a single choice of non-yellow beer. Not a single IPA available.< /text>

<Review>Rudest people ever! The waitress gave us attitude right off the bat, rolling her eyes. We may not be locals, but you should treat everyone with respect if you want people to come spend money at your bar. Our friends that went in 30 min before us said the same thing. They're lucky we didn't walk out...... not going back</Review>< date>

<text>Honestly my favorite place to get cut. The place is always hospitable. They have great music and multiple TVs so that you’ll always catch the game. Fades speak for themselves. Give it a try.< /text><user_name>C Woulard< /user_name></record>

This is fantastic barber shop. They have plenty of chairs and Excellent barbers.
Our Barber is Bryan he gives an excellent haircut. He listens and makes sure you're happy with your cut.
Everyone is welcome all hair types and textures.

Wow! Eddie really came to the rescue! I took my 15 year old son to a different barber  and had a not so pleasant experience and a bad haircut. We both agreed that we needed to find a barber to fix it, but didn't know where. I found the Culture Lounge and decided to give it a shot. Eddie made sure to really talk to my son to see what he wanted and went to work. The attention to detail was obvious and he really turned it into the best haircut my son's had. On top of that he offered the haircut on the house for our "pain and suffering"

Very professional, listens to what you want and doesn't quit until you're satisfied. We are definitely customers for life now!</review>

Crystal is an amazing barber/hairstylist and she really took her time to give me an amazing cut!!  She is really patient and personable and I would definitely return to Culture Barber Lounge to get my hair cut by her or any of the other barbers, everyone is really laid back to be around :)</review>

Beto always hooks up my man right.  The shop has a cool vibe,  music,  games while you wait and plenty of merchandise to look thru.  They offer you a beverage and everyone is very chill but professional.  Very easy to schedule an appointment. Shop is always clean.  They also have a lady that does braids,  I've never gotten any but ive seen her work and its nice.<//text>

<review>Very professional place to get a haircut for kids and adults. The atmosphere is welcoming. I am a mom to a child on the Spectrum and taking my son to get a haircut has always been not a fun thing to do. The owner Tage is simply amazing with him. He understands and makes sure my son is comfortable and lets him know what he is going to do next. Which if you are a parent with a child on the spectrum, you know how that is a huge thing.</review>< pics>

Cuttqueen aka Crystal has my scalp and hair looking and feeling great! Started getting my hair braided by her and now she’s the only one I go to. She really knows her stuff especially when it comes to natural remedies for that scalp and hair of yours. She has her own hair products, and I really suggest you grab a bottle or two!</Text>

<text>Tage is a self made businessman and entrepreneur. Culture Barber Lounge is the product of his drive and talent. What you get is a clean, professional, and inviting establishment that delivers all and more in a barbershop. All barbers in the shop can cut and the prices are competitive within the North County Area. You'll always leave satisfied and will definitely be back for more. Highly recommend.<//text><UserId.>108936267720317475987<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had been looking for a master barber to do a professional undercut design. He fixed my hair and created the exact look I wanted, in fact even better! There were so many modern tools that he used with expert precision. I was thrilled, near happy tears. I will never go to anyone else.< /Review><user_name>Lizz Miller</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>i came here to get a fade and a lineup and was charged $30. the last time i came here to get a haircut i asked for a fade, lineup, and an inch off the top and was only charged $25. also, the last time i was here i saw someone only pay $20, but they only got a fade and a lineup (from what i remember), so with that logic i thought that i'd only have to pay $20, but instead i got charged an extra $10. the haircut i got was great though, that's why i give it 2 stars instead of 1, but the price is way too high in my  opinion. when i asked the barber why it's $30 he just told me "it's just how it is, even military is only $25." i'm not in the military though. like i said, i only paid $25 the last time and i wasn't asked if i was in the military or anything. bottom line, i'm not going back here if i'm going to be charged this much for a simple fade and lineup.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

This barbershop is truly amazing sometimes ladies we go to barbershops and there’s lots of mail and it can be intimidating however this barbershop is super professional I take my boys to get their haircut and I actually stick around because it’s not an uncomfortable environment super clean super professional I definitely would recommend this barber shop To anyone who wants a fresh haircut and professionalism definitely come here and if you’re a single mom this is definitely the place you want to be as far as taking your boy to get a haircut on your own sometimes can be intimidating but I never felt that way This is your one stop shop for your barber needs if you’re in Oceanside and you are the best barbershop hands-down Tage and his staff or where you want to go!!!😁😎🤩</text>

Brought both of my kids to get cuts, they did a great job. My 13 year old daughter got an undercut and my son had a perfect fade done. Great price, hospitality and vibe. We will be back< /Text>

Great service, outstanding performance by the barbers and hair stylist. Highly Recommend Crystal for great hair styling if your looking to color she pretty much can do anything with your hair.

<Review>This is a thriving business.  To be thoughtful about kids with play area,  to always trying to accommodate women and men needs while waiting.  Good to see the diversity with barbers and hair braider with a place to get color,  layered,  styles that's in fashion.  1 stop shop with a great atmosphere<//Review>< name>

Tage is one of the best barbers I’ve ever seen. He is patient, attentive, and professional. If you want it cut “straight” the first time, he’s your best choice in this area.</Review>

<Text>Took my baby boy in for a quick line up and was very content with the outcome and customer service provided.This was only his 2nd cut ever and the barber was excellent with him. He managed to keep my son still and entertained. I definitely recommend Culture Barber lounge.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1577601170612, 'text': '🥰🥰🥰'}</response><GmapID>0x80dc711d6e332edf:0xa6bd6ee724a95e0b<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Tage has been cutting my sons hair since the first day he started getting cuts ... since about 3 years old and he is now 5. Tage is always great with my son, always makes it a fun experience for him and has grown him to learn to love getting his cuts. My son always gets what he wants whether it’s a clean skin fade or a lightning bolt to make him feel like a superhero :). I appreciate Culture Barber Lounge and the cleanliness, catering to children and family atmosphere and professionalism.

Crystal also hooked me up with a quick wash, trim and flat iron and had my hair feelin healthy and fresh. I will be seeing her for color treatment and she is deff my go to girl! I completely recommend her for your beauty needs!

Prices are well worth the work and it’s always a good time when stepping into the lounge.

Thank you tage for getting my son comfortable and always Vibin with him! Your talents are unmatched as well!<//text>

If I could give 10 stars, I would. I've ate at plenty of restaurants that knock you back into your seat and make you question all your previous food choices, but this place may, hands down, have been the best food I've ever had, and I'm close with a few top-end chefs in Colorado. Also, I consider myself a bit of a Mexican food connoisseur and chef, and still... Man, it was unbelievably good...

Everything about my dish was perfect. Each ingredient was cooked with the best method to it's optimal temperature separately and then combined when appropriate. This was truly gourmet tasting food in a small, husband-wife combo ran Mexican restaurant.

ON TOP OF THAT, the service was PHENOMENAL. I swear our waitress had to love her job, because she was incredible and we thoroughly enjoyed her company.</Review>

The space is very pleasant.  They do a busy take-out business with regular customers.  The chips and salsa are not remarkable.  I ordered fish tacos.  The homemade flour tortillas were yummy and everything tasted fresh.  The chipotle flavor was a surprise but I liked them.  Next time I want to try the mole.  Looks like just wine and beer, no margaritas.</review>

If you're like me, you've spent hours looking for authentic Mexican food in your travels just to be disappointed in many occasions. Id admit i was hesitant at first being that this was my 3rd spot in Tahoe that i was trying out. The staff was very friendly and cordial but the best part was the food. The carnitas was to die for and the salsa they have available was one of the best ive ever tried.< /Text>

Maria's Mexican Restaurant has a fantastic vegan burrito that is worth trying if you are a full time meat eater or the most hardcore vegan. All the ingredients are fresh and delicious. I can't recommend their food enough.

They have great customer service too. I ordered a regular burrito vegan style and they changed it to their special vegan burrito with vegan ground beef and vegan cheese and called me when it was ready.

Love this place! ♥️</text>

New restaurant. Fantastic food! I cannot say enough about their food. I have had camarones a la diabla, carnitas burrito, chicken burrito, and chicken enchiladas with green sauce. It was all very delicious! Sit down service has some kinks to work out, but they are very friendly and accommodating. (Star was knocked off for sit down service). I will be back and hopefully can update this review. Call earlier than you want to eat for takeout because their food can take awhile. But well worth it!</review>

Excellent chicken fajitas! My daughter had the burrito and enjoyed it as well. We started with the nachos which did not disappoint. Our server was fantastic; very sweet and attentive. There was a bit of a wait given there were only four parties and the salsa was very runny and flavorless or I’d give this place 5 stars.</Text>

We came during the Covid madness and they had nice tables setup outside for dining. The service was great. Super prompt with refills and offering lots of salsas for us to try. Server was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. The food was delicious. Everyone in our party loves their food and my kids declared it “the best Mexican food they’ve ever had!”  Highly recommend!< /Text>

First, very prompt and great service. The food was fresh and delicious - tons of flavor, very authentic. Also, loved the outside seating available during covid restrictions. If you are in the area, highly recommend! Don’t miss out.< /Text>< Pics>

This was my 1st visit here and it was during the COVID-19 Pandemic. They do an excellent job keeping customers socially distant. They could make better use of their space but you will definitely feel safe dining in. The staff was great especially our server Juan. The food presentation was great but the food itself left a lot to be desired taste wise. The food will fill you up but I've definitely had better Mexican food. We had a group of 4 including kids so the pictures included are chicken fingers and fries, chicken tacos, enchiladas and taquitos. The least favorite was the taquitos as the chicken didn't seem seasoned at all. However the chicken in the tacos was well seasoned. The enchiladas could have used more seasoning also. Again great service and we felt safe but the food left more to be desired.</review>

The food and service was AMAZING!!! First, our waitress went above and beyond during a sudden hail storm. Second, the food was to die for and very authentic. I’ve been to Mexico many times and a bit of a foodie, so I’m rarely impressed with Mexican food in The States.</review>

<Text>Dropped in here because of the wonderful reviews on yelp. The guacamole was superb!
Loved the handmade tortillas  too!  My husband got the fish tacos, and I got the chili relleno.  Both were very good.  My only complaint was the salsa.  It was too sweet for me.  My husband liked it however.  Service was great.  Fast too!
Belle obviously loves her job and is very friendly!

First time eating here and we were not disappointed.  My wife had the Camarones a la Diabla $16 (shrimp in spicy red sauce) and I had Tacos a la Calle Al Vegano $13 (vegetarian tacos with soy chorizo and potatoes). I have been a vegetarian for 9 months and these are one of the best tacos I have eaten. They use handmade tortillas for these tacos. Awesome!  The food here is very good.<//text>

Inclusive menu for plant based eating.  The best Mexican food I've had in Reno-Tahoe area bar none.  Fresh salsas, handmade tortillas, and multiple vegan (plant based) options.  Very friendly staff, family owned and run.  What a treat to have in the area!< /Text>

One of the top Mexican restaurants in South Lake. Small but clean interior. Unfortunately no space for outside dining. They offer delivery through DoorDash. Service is awesome. The women that are usually there are top notch. Patient, friendly, and knowledgeable.</Review>

We had the best time and food in this place! The customer service was outstanding!! They topped up our waters, they came to the table to check on us and the food...omg! I wish I had more space to eat more of their food!
We are vegetarian and they had a full on vegan menu. We picked chille relleno, tacos veganos (vegan beef or you can get potato and soy chorizo) with guacamole to start. The guacamole is freshly made so it took a few minutes (not long) and it was totally worth it. One of the best if not the best I had.
We will definitely be back to this place! Oi want to try their green enchiladas.  We had a great time and I highly recommend this place for any mexican food lovers.</text>

Fair prices, great food! You can tell they cook their meat over an open flame when you taste it. Their carne asada burritos are bomb and large enough to fill up someone with an appetite< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This place is amazing, my dryer broke and I went here to get the part for it. Took no more then five minutes to get what I needed and out the door I went to fix my dryer. You can even call first before going, and they will even hold the part you need to be picked up before you get there. Make service even quicker. I recommend this place if you need parts for appliances ☺️<//Review>< GmapID>

Not only did they have the part I needed, much cheaper than other stores. They also helped put a rush on getting the part without any additional fees. Great website/inventory and excellent customer service!< /Text>

My online order is coming from San Diego even though when I placed it it was supposedly in stock at their Colton store to pick up. Now I have to wait until next Monday to pick it up...very disappointing.<//Review>

In need of an replacement part for a appliance?  Look no farther, because it's here, if not, they'll have for you either the next day or the day after. They're very knowledgeable and will give you the best price in town.<//Review>

<text>This is the only place you can go if you need a specific part but just be prepared for the rudest customer service people you'll ever have to deal with. And the longest wait on the planet.  The old man is grumpy and treats you with no respect. And has no idea how to help people quickly so they don't have to wait.  The guy in front of me knew he had a complicated case and told the old man to go ahead and help me first and he said no you were here first. Then when that guys problem was even more challenging he told the old man twice to stop and help me first he instead started answering the phone and doing stock checks for people on the phone.  Then the girl moves slow and doesn't seem to know what she's doing because a guy came back in saying that he didn't have all of his order. And she couldn't even find the order but kept saying that she remembers him calling and saying that he needed those and that she did order them. Well she didn't and he had to wait another 3days and was pissed and wasn't right and he didn't even get a discount considering that bow his work was affected because those parts were needed for a customer.  Just try and avoid this place at all costs.</text>< Pictures>

Well I have to say this is by far the best appliance parts store in all of the Inland Empire. Extreamly knowledgeable, resonably priced parts and very helpful with all questions. These guys had more knowledge then associates at Sears service center. Lifelong customer now I could happily say😊< /Text>

<Review>Great service knowledgeable people. I can get things cheaper sometimes on the net, but have to wait 2 weeks to get, then a hassle if I want to return it, not here, they have to make a profit if the want to stay in business and a few dollars more won't break me for the ease of getting my parts.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
When to the thermostat on my kenmore dryer and the Hispanic guy sells it to me for 27.99 he then tells me he can fix it for me so he gives me his number I go home and install the part and come to find out my thermo fuse is out this is a very cheap to buy piece but when I walked into the store the Hispanic guy tells me he knew I would be back and try's to sell me the fuse for 27.99 so of corse I told him no I can get this piece for 5.00 at Sears parts or other places so I went to Sears parts and got it for 6.79 . DONT GET RIPED OFF BY THIS GUY HE OVER CHARGES ON THE PARTS< /Review>

When things go according to plan, it is easy to give 5 stars, but the true test of a company is the authority it gives to their employees to do the right thing and fix an unplanned situation for the customer.  Here's what happened...

I had a GREAT experience with RV&AP and if you get an opportunity to work with Crystal, you will wish for 6 stars to rate her here!  My order came earlier than expected, but the box was torn open during shipping and it was missing two key parts.  I called Crystal, she sent a return-ship request (free to me) and then sent me a replacement.  The replacement came unharmed and I installed the Reese Puck system on my F-250.

While the first box did not come as planned, the key here is that it was not RV&AP's fault, but they did right by me and fixed the situation in a timely manner.  THAT is how a GREAT company operates!

Thank you Crystal!  I will be back!!!--Jeremie</text>

Buyer beware, unless your willing to wait months and get the run around.
Same hood purchased says in stock guess it’s a common practice by this company to bait and switch and claim it’s on backorder.

No apology or anything, why have employees that do nothing. Place is a scam if your looking to waste your time and playing the waiting game
RVautoparts.com is a great place to get nothing</text>< pics>

I did not read any reviews of RV and Auto until after I had received my order. I ordered an Equalizer hitch that cost $657 everywhere else. I paid $422 at RV and Auto. I was skeptical of this price, so I called and emailed the company to make sure it was the right part at that price. Their communications were very quick responses and made me feel comfortable so I ordered the hitch. When I received the hitch from UPS, the box was damaged (weighs like 80 lbs). I unpacked the boxes and there was a part missing. I contacted Michelle at RV and Auto and she tried to find the missing part to send it to me but was unable. She sent me a link to order it directly from the manufacturer and she refunded the cost of this part plus shipping to my paypal account immediately. This missing part was not RV Auto's mistake since UPS damaged the box, but Michelle was very quick to solve my issue. I don't know where all the bad reviews came from, but I found just the opposite from my experience. This company has excellent prices and exemplary customer service. Good job RV and Auto!<//review>

<Text>Recently had an issue with how my order was handled during shipping and the damage that was incurred. Called and talked to Crystal and she was very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. Like many of you, customer service online can be challenging and it was refreshing to call and actually talk to a person about my issue and receive excellent customer support. Will continue to rely on them for my RV needs.<//Text>< username>

I recently ordered parts for my truck, from RV and Auto Parts. Upon installing it was found that one part had a manufacturers defect. Michelle at RV and Auto Parts was EXTREMELY helpful in getting a replacement sent out to me quickly, and efficiently without hassle. Customer service is top notch!! I’ll definitely do business with them in the future!!<//text>

I had a poor experience with this company. All because they shipped a duplicate helmet I was nice enough to email them to send a return label. Experience below:

1.) I placed original order - paid on time.

2.) Order shipped

3.) When order arrives, turns out RV agents duplicate order (Mistake one)

4.) I was "honest" enough to message about extra helmet

5.) All I received was a return label and sent back helmet. Apparently, I should have done RV person's job and leave a message on the invoice it was a duplicate and just a return. Since there wasn't a note their system about it (which is weird). Causing the mess or they should have sent instruction on what needed to be done not just a return label.

6.) RV without a heads up, email, or call decided they would refund me from the original charge (another mistake), figure out what they did, and then try to correct it by sending me an invoice (without an email explaining it - third mistake).

7.) ALL I SAW WAS RV MESSING WITH MY ACCOUNT. I had to do research to see why they sent me an invoice. Lucky I figured it out and am understanding, or I would have put in a fraud alert. I paid the invoice and received my first email "Thanks so much for your honesty in paying the invoice I sent you." What honesty? I did what I should have done but they did not.

8.) It's done now, I will not deal with the company again which is sad since the helmet was what I was looking for (hence the two star). In the future they should send an emails explaining the transaction "We are refunding you for your return of ..." or "We made an error, please pay invoice of $$ for original order." By-the-way, PayPal was the one notifying me about "RV & Auto Parts" transaction.

9.) I don't like dealing with companies that do things with money (especially mine) without communicating. Conduct business at your own risk. This was a simple situation that didn't need to be this way.<//text>

<text>Today, April 14, 2021, I have finally contacted the Attorney General of the State of California and the Riverside District Attorney to file a consumer complaint about RV & Auto Parts.  I have been dealing with this company for repair, return or refund of a faulty Splendide washing machine I purchased through Amazon since mid October of 2020.  My letters, calls and emails have been ignored.  There has never been a resolution, and they have my machine now, purchased on August 27, 2020.  They will not give it back, nor repair it nor refund the $1,021.23.  I cannot purchase another machine as I do not have the money to do so as they will not refund my money for the faulty machine they have now in their possession since December 2, 2020.  I am seeking resolution.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

No way to check or cancel your order online, no responses to emails. In the backorder email it says my payment method has not been charged and that is a blatant lie as I was charged as soon as the order was made. I've contacted through email twice and made a case with PayPal. I ordered because it said the item was in stock and I need it ASAP, I cant wait for an item on backorder, I need my money back as soon as possible to purchase the item from somewhere else. If the owner of RV and Auto Parts or an employee of the company is reading this, please cancel order #R-427735 immediately.</Text>

<Text>After ordering new running boards for $100 cheaper than any other company...well let's just say I was skeptical. Then, I read some negative reviews and got worried. But let me tell you the product shipped fast within a few days of ordering. I spoke with customer service to confirm order was being shipped and they were very helpful. Zero issues with this company. Will buy from them again.</Text>< Pics>

My mistake, I should have read reviews. Apparently this company notoriously sells things that aren’t in stock. I ordered some caliber snowmobile ramps on 12/23/20. Said it would be in stock on 12/25. Money was taken out of my account immediately. I called on 12/29 and was told they sold out upon arrival and the next delivery which would take place on 1/4 would fulfill my order. It’s now 1/6 and have no information. No response to email, called and left a message and no return call either. Poor communication.</text>

After receiving an order, I found one of the items damaged in shipping. When I've sent them photos of the damaged item, RV Auto Parts promptly sent a replacement. Their customer service is second to none !
Thanks for the AMAZING experience :-)<//text>

<Review>RV & Autoparts had the best price on a Reese Sidewinder Pinbox. We purchased and immediately started getting communication via email on the purchase confirmation and shipping. Shipping was quick (and free), which was surprising because the part we ordered was 200lbs+. Overall great experience, would order from them again--no issues.<//Review>< pics>

Quick delivery and excellent, responsive customer service. A box was damaged in shipment and the seller quickly helped me determine if anything was missing (nothing was). Then they gave me an unsolicited credit of $75 for my inconvenience.< /review>

I ordered a Revarc snowmobile ramp on 10/21 and it arrived on 10/27.  It sounds like others have had different experiences so it made me a little nervous ordering from them, but they had the best price so I took a chance.  Sure the shipment notification email was a couple days behind, as well as the delivery notification email, but I have no complaints, yet.  I have yet to use it, but I opened it and looked at it.  Other than some minor scuffing from transport I assume, it seems to work as advertised.  So bottom line, if you can be patient and not expect regular/timely emails after the initial order email, I think 6 days for coast to coast shipping is pretty darn good.<//text>

Guys, this place simply rocks! I’ve shopped for car and RV stuff for decades and can honestly tell you that the customer service here is super good. Quickest replies and shipping I’ve ever seen from any only store and I buy a lot from many places online. Oh, and have a look at all these low prices too! Simply mind blowing to think how anyone can be so low on so much and yet still keep the doors open. But they do.

Look, you’re not going to go wrong in ordering from this place. You can expect the best because you’re shopping at the best when you shop here. This place is the best I’ve seen so far and that’s based on several aspects that matter to me. Aspects like quality parts, knowledgeable, courteous customer service a selection that’s mind boggling and super fast shipping to boot.

Look, my experience shopping here has been a 10 star kind of experience. So much so that I am sure you can expect the same. If you need help, just contact them and boom help is quickly given. Have questions? Ask and they will work hard at quickly getting you the answer you need. I highly recommend this store and believe you will too once you’ve shopped here.

Honestly, you can spend with confidence here because the products are all top notch and at a price you simply can’t beat too.

There’s NO JUNK SOLD here like you can quickly find on some sites that will obviously cost you more and just leave you disappointed and waiting on a reply. Totally not the case here guys.

Yes! I’ll be shopping here as often as I can, because my experience here has really stood out as this being high quality store in every aspect that matters.

Seriously, this place really does stand above the rest when it comes to price, customer service and shipping.

Bravo RV and Auto Parts. You’ve built a a winning team and their efforts really shine through every aspect of e commerce.

Now, I want to speak to that new to here customer. You know, the one that reads all the reviews before shopping. Yes, I want to speak directly to you. I really hope you can disregard and get past the negative reviews you might find here. Some people simply can’t be pleased no matter what and those kinds of people all seem to love dropping nasty reviews and all in hope of you sharing in their misery. Don’t do it. Just go shopping and be happy like me okay?

Just put those items you want and need in the shopping cart and go check out with confidence. The RV and Auto Parts team will always do their best to get you what you order in record time and at a price that will make any online store mad at them for doing it so well. Again, this place simply rocks.

This is a GREAT STORE, I’ll be back and as often as possible too. I really think you will too after shopping here.

Respectfully and sincerely,
1 Happy Customer.

I got an open box that was re-taped closed.  I didn’t mind that as much as all the missing parts. They sent me a open box with missing parts for full asking price on Amazon.  On top of that I had to contact amazon because I didn’t get my refund in a timely manner. Be aware when ordering from this company.< /Text>< date>

In came in with a torn up box that looked like it was a previous return with no hardware, I was ok with this and asked if they can send me a hardware pack, they said no and ask to ship it back. They set up pickup and it was picked up. The “second” rack was lost according to their customer service. So she said they will send another one. What arrived today was literally the original torn up box with another box over it. I checked to see if maybe they put the hardware in there, nope. So they sent me the same rack twice, with missing parts. So I ordered beginning of August and it’s mid September and I don’t have a rack.

I highly recommend NOT doing business with this business.  I ordered a roof bike rack and I got the confirmation email.  About 2 weeks later I emailed them to find out about my order with no response.  3 weeks later I called and went straight to voicemail so I left a message with my order number, etc.  Never got a response.  About a week later I was finally able to get a hold of someone on the phone.  The told me that my order was cancelled over the phone 2 days after I ordered the product.  I never got a hold of them until over 3 weeks later so I didn't cancel the order.  Luckily they refunded the money.  The lady on the phone was nice, but their communication was horrible.  I have no idea why my order was cancelled.<//text>

I purchased a dog carrier for my motorcycle from RV and Auto Parts online. I later realized that I would need another for my husband's motorcycle to take both of our pups along with us. The service was excellent. The orders were 7 days apart but delivery was only two days apart. The carriers were wrapped in plastic, airbags inserted to keep the shape of the leather during shipment, then boxed with extra packing. It was a very smooth easy transaction.</review>

<review>I came to write a great review for this place. I was nervous after seeing all the poor reviews on here, on whether or not I would get my RV part. Let me tell you that I received it fast and had no problems whatsoever! The company may have been struggling at the beginning of the pandemic with the sudden increase in demand (RV boom happened), but I would say that they seem to be back on track with things. I would recommend this place.</review><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

My order never came, when I inquired about it they told me it was canceled and then sent me someone else's receipt for a different product with that person's credit card number, address, and name. The receipt asked for my signature and then they would authorize the charge to this random guys card. 1 star for sharing another customers personnel information with me.< /Review>

<Review>Absolutely great experience! I ordered a winch and winch switch for my ATV in the evening on June 23. To my pleasant surprise, the winch switch arrived via UPS on June 25th and the winch arrived via FedEx on. June 26th. That is very impressive delivery times. I am also very pleased with the product I purchased. This was my first time ordering and it was a 5 star purchase all the way!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I was skeptical ordering from here, but boy did I receive a great deal and it shipped fast.  I think folks don't realize how the industry works. Most items that you order online are dropped shipped.  That's probably why there are so many negative reviews for this store.  It's nearly impossible to have every single item on your website in stock, and just sitting there. I'll definitely be ordering again from RV and Auto Parts.

Just another faceless online place to take your order and money and then that's it. No response to emails. Order and then nothing happens but a lame email acknowledging your order.   1 day after ordering no update no way to check shipping or status or know if your part is in stock and coming or how long you might be waiting.  DO not expect any follow up or customer service. Place your order and wonder.  Prices aren't that good to wonder if you might actually get what you ordered. 1st time and last time ordering here.< /review>

<Review>I received excellent service!
I ordered for an Onan 5500 RV generator for an unbelievably low price and an unbelievably low shipping rate.  The exact generator I ordered arrived sooner than I had anticipated (over a week earlier), well packed on a pallet, that was delivered with an electric pallet jack, right into my garage.

Should have read reviews first! I got scammed as well. In the checkout and Apple Pay it said $0 shipping, then my email receipt said $16.50 shipping! Called immediately and emailed within 5 minutes, then two times after and no response. It's like they want to ignore you, process the order, and charge a bunch of fees! I contacted my credit card to stop it within 10 minutes as well so we will see what happens. Sticking to Amazon for now on!< /review>

After not being able to reach someone for a couple of days I received a call asking if I wanted to wait for the product for 2 weeks or just have my money refunded to me. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't have the item in stock but I am satisfied with the timely response back to my messages.<//text>

Great buying experience with RV and Auto Parts. I ordered a vest from their site. The shipping was handled in a quick manner. They provided track for the package. Thank you so much for your service.< /review>

<Review>I recently ordered a new shifting knob for my car through Amazon from RV and Auto Parts. When I first was notified by USPS that it was delivered I checked my mailbox and only had a completely empty business envelope from this company. No shifting knob, no paperwork, nothing.
I called the company and their representative I spoke to was very pleasant and quickly notified me it was a mix up and that they would next-day ship the part immediately.
Just received the part and I love it. Mistakes happen and I'm very happy with how the whole situation was handled<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1588875149905, 'text': 'Hi Chris,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review us!

Do not buy from this company. Placed an order a week ago and it still hasn’t shipped. They don’t answer their phone or respond to emails. I guess I’ll have to get my credit card company involved.</Review>

Well I have to say, based on some of the recent reviews I was certainly skeptical about how my purchase would go. I placed my order on a Saturday and on Monday morning I recieved my shipping info. I had a question about the order and my email was responded to quickly. 2 days later I received a call to sent up my freight delivery for the next day. Shipper arrived within the scheduled time. Product was exactly what I ordered with no issues. It was an absolute perfect purchase. Thank you and I will definitely be doing business here again.< /Review>

Still waiting on my part. Been 18 days. Should've read these reviews before I made the purchase. I'm in the middle of a move and living in my RV with out plumbing, waiting on this part. This situation is just not worth the two bucks I saved buying from rvautoparts. It's easy to blame the Covid pandemic, and USPS, but I've had other parts delivered within the same time frame, from other vendors.< /review>

List items they don't really have in stock.Then two days later they email you to say not in stock. False Advertising. They charged you card and no answer. Read all the bad reviews terrible customer service. Like the other posts mentioned, this is a fraudulent company. They do not stock anything that is listed.< /Text>

Item was (and still is) listed as "in stock". I made sure of that after reading the other reviews. I was charged for my purchase, and then received an e-mail claiming that the item was listed as "on backorder". Judging from the other reviews, this appears to be common practice at RV and Auto Parts<//Text>

These are the days you want to support your local businesses.  Made an order online,  PIF.  Received my confirmation email of my purchase which stated a follow up with come with my shipping #.  Tried calling to see if I can just pick up my order being local, No one picked up, so I sent a follow up email... and that is where it all went down hill.  No one answers the phone, no one responds to emails. Open hours state after 8 am. Took a couple days after 1 pm (they set a VM stating at lunch at noon), to be placed on 15 + mins holds, to be hung up on, calling back , to hold again for 15+ mins.  FINALLY a person answer to say my order is coming from a 3rd party, out of LA and "I should have received my tracking number".  She stated it has been shipped. NOTHING Arrives again-no email, no order... waited 3 days Called and again long holds, drop call, to call and wait again to be told in fact NO my order did not ship, they don't have any idea on the status and said I would receive a call back by 1 pm the next day.  I wait again NO CALL BACK.  I, again, called to go through the same issues, no one there after 8 am- phone just rings rings then drops, a voicemail set to pick up at noon stating they are at lunch, and then after 1 pm, my call picked, up to be told hold OVER 20 MINS!  At this point, I requested to cancel, this is horrible customer service, the order has not been fulfilled and told again "they have no idea , and can't get a hold of their vendor".  An requested an email confirmation.  Waited 1 day, no email, called again and FINALLY received the email while I waited on the phone, to received a FULL refund by Monday 6/1...... and it is past the 6/1 and NO REFUND!  I truly wanted to support a local business but just like the prior reviewers, it has been a stressful and horrible experience!  Bad customer service, no follow up, my order was not fulfilled and I felt passed around, lied to, no one had a straight answer and still at the end, they have not corrected this my refunding my money.   BEWARE!< /text>

I needed a shaft coupling for my slide-out motor/gearbox.  RV and Auto Parts had the part I needed for a good price so I ordered it.  The next day I decided to google them and saw some good reviews and some disturbing ones, some went as far as to say the business was a fraud.  Well I am happy to report my experience.  I ordered the part on a Tuesday and it arrived on Friday, and that was with standard shipping.  I will likely purchase from them again.<//text>

Don’t recommend this site. Ordered a 12 v battery from them online that I cannot find elsewhere, and they ended up canceling it after emailing me asking me to reach out. They did not answer the phone or email for days. They claimed it was cancelled because it was marked fraudulent..? 4 days after I made the order and when I found out it was cancelled, I replaced the order and noted to have them reach out to me for any issues with my payment. I screen shotted the new order to the representative who lacked good communication during the cancellation of my order. She immediately responds to me over email telling me that the battery has been discontinued and that I would be refunded a second time. So moral of the story is that It seems no one is willing to answer the phone or call back on voicemails and hardly on emails even when they requested I reach out to them originally. I also not impressed with the fact that I got two different excuses for the same product within days of each other. I don’t understand why products on your site are available for purchase if they are unavailable or discontinued..</Text>

<Review>They do not honor their purchases.  Waited more than 24 hours to tell me they were out of stock, after confirming the order via email.  Strong ditto to other customers who had bad online experiences - they simply cannot honor their online purchases.  Do not recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I was searching for a particular HKS exhaust using Google. RV and Auto parts has the best price. Although the product page says backorder, I was still able to place the order. A couple of hours later I received an email saying the product is out of stock. They can do a special order for me, but at a higher price.

I then come back to their site and searched for all HKS Exhaust System Kit. There are 8 listed on their website and 6 of them say backorder. What a shaddy way to do business.<//text>< user>

< Review>
Abysmal experience.  Placed an order for a slideout gearbox.  Paid +100 for overnight delivery.  Called them and left a message to seek callback.  Wanted verbal confirmation they understood this had to go next day air.  Tracked order and was notified by UPS that sender (RV and auto parts) sent the product too late so 1 day delay.  Got some meaningless apology from them stating it wasn’t deliberate.  Reminded me of my child explaining they didn’t mean to sneak a cookie.  Then when product got to my home state hub, it was returned because somebody over there is too careless to write legibly.  Another meaningless apology.  Cancelling order.  I have proof of this comedy of errors.  I write this on 8/2 (4 days after my original order where I paid next day air).  I’m in my RV, no new part from company.  They suck.<//Review>

Awful company cant get your money back.wont ship the product when they said. Impossible to contact. Do not use this company they should honestly just shut the doors. If i would have read the reviews before i ordered i wouldnt have even placed the order. The worst company that i have had to deal with<//Text>

<text>Terrible service. Would give zero stars if I could. I left phone messages and sent emails about missing items from my shipment. Finally spoke to someone after waiting in hold for 20 mins. Their answer was that this part was not included when the description on their web site clearly stated it was. I asked for some help on the price of the missing part and they said they could reduce my shipping cost to $9 but they had very little margin and could not reduce the cost of the item. I went I eBay and got it brand new for $10 less with free shipping! Buyer beware!!!< /text>< name>

As stated by a few reviewers below, this website is very likely a scam website. I made a purchase at the advertised price for a product then they sent me an email a few days later requesting me to pay over twice the listed price before they’ll ship it.

Please avoid at all costs, and if you do purchase use PayPal as a means of protection.</text>

I recommend ordering over the phone and picking up your order. Taco Tuesdays and Wednesdays are $1.25. Mind you, the tacos those days are a bit smaller than their regular tacos but they are just as tasty.<//Review>

Robert Jimenez-McWilliams is with Juan Jimenez-McWilliams and Griselda Celis.
Just now ·
DELICIOUS!!!! The Restaurant "Taqueria El Guero, Authentic Mexican Food" and it truly is. This place is a Hidden Gem in the Stater Brothers Plaza in the Far Right Corner. You would hardly know it's there, But!!! you need to know its there!!! The food there is out of this world. So many choices to choose from, and each one made to perfection. I had the Shrimp Fajita and I could not stop eating it. The Owner, Chuy, is also the cook and great personality and our server Griselda Celis speaks Spanish and English and is so friendly and helpful.

<user_name>Juan Cardenas<//user_name>< Review>
Ordered one hour in advance. Showed up on time to a slow restaurant. Lady at the register was rude and told me my order isn't ready yet. 10 minutes later she asked me what I ordered again. How can ordering food be so complicated? I ended up having to go somewhere else. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE..< /Review>

Walk in to order to go was pretty fast. Good service. My enchilada and chile relleno was missing the tortilla for the enchilada.  But tasted good. Tortas are good too.</Review>

It's a hole in the wall. With great Mexican food. Clean and friendly. It has a Market there as well. Butcher as well .Pretty much a one stop store. Buy meat milk eggs ...

Great little place. A favorite amongst the locals. If you're looking for more traditional fare, and tired of El Torito.. This restaurant will scratch that itch. Friendly and clean. Well worth checking out..
Everyone leaves with a smile.<//Review>

<name>Jeri Sofka<//name><review>I can only review the cheese enchiladas as I dont care for meat. I've tried the 4 main restaurants in DHS and this little hidden spot is my favorite.  The enchilada sauce tastes homemade and they are smothered in cheese. It can be hard to see the entrance adjacent to the Mexican ice cream shop.< /review><user_id>103258464834473581092</user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>4<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

The food here was not good! Super expensive for slop. The aqua super watered down. I got 2 breakfast burritos chorizo and 2 aquas jamica.  The 3 people that ordered their food after me got their food first.  Then when she handed me the bag she goes . Here you go here's your food btw there is no rice it's not ready. Is that okay.  As I'm holding the food already in my arms and after waiting longer then expected.  She says you wanna wait 10 mins I can get you rice. This was at 10:00am how is there no rice!!!    Ugh it cost me $30 for this meal .  I will never go back. Rude service!< /review>

When I arrived I was told my side of rice will be ready in 10 minutes. Waited 20 extra minutes while the rest of my order got cold.
Also while I was waiting i noticed the cooks drinking on the job..the rice was disgusting get it together</Review>

This place is good and affordable. The carnitas is probably their best meat. It's a whole in the wall with great food, large servings, and great prices.< /text>

Waited for an hour for two combination plates! And it was a to-go order!! When we finally got our food they didn't even get it right. Ordered a chicken enchilada and they just gave us a cheese enchilada. Not fun waiting that long when it's a hundred and ten degrees outside!!</text>

There food is delicious , if they get your order wrong there happily willing to correct it without any problems , there fast at sevice with food and attending with clients if it's not busy eathier waiting isn't so long , I don't believe they would've took a hour for a combination when most of there foods is out in a couple mins that's a bad review on a review ^ lol , BEST CARNITAS IN THE VALLEY , seen them cut and use fresh ingredients not no in bag food , I rate them 5 stars for service ,  food plus it's fresh and best price compared to other places in the valley</review>

My family and I went shopping for Christmas gifts today. We were there at least a couple of hours. We had some very helpful employees, but the one that really stood out was the cashier, who we will call her "K". K was exceptional. She was courteous, helpful, and very patient; which is unfortunately very rare in customer service anymore.<//Text>

One of the many perks I enjoy as a retiree are my Exchange privileges. The tax-free shopping, the great assortment of products, price matching, and multiple lanes for a quick checkout is a major plus. You're bound to find a great discount if you're a bargain shopper. 20-50% off in some of the clearance sections of clothing and shoe deals. Another plus the MCX just added was the Gap brand! Happy shopping!<//text>

<Text>I don't normal shop at the MCX on Pendleton, but the excellent level of customer service I received from Ms Adeline in jewelry was top notch.
She was knowledgeable, attentive and kind.
It's just about Christmas time and the lines moved quickly. They have a good traffic flow, we were able to socially distance, hand sanitizer was available. It was a good day at the MCX!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr9w6RMLoKiZ5Tatwui4E-K83vnayJyAv4SjaP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWM6XyrVquYPzHKW_1ua1BhNANQbTkYNMv-id7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi4nCJilHdJBLTf_VJf_wW7DqNxBhBso6SrDgM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc6f97bc45321f:0xbd8ad9782239694<//GmapID></record>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Coming from 29 Palms after living on base  for 13 years, I was told that the Camp Pendleton location was the biggest store they offer on a Marine Corps base. After shopping there several times, I realised 29 Palms though it may be smaller, has Camp Pendleton MCX beat by MILES. I can never find ANY shoes my size at Pendleton location. Their selection of clothing isn't the best either in my opinion. I don't want to live in 29 Palms again, but I sure wish I could have their MCX back!!< /review>< pictures>

A wide and great selection of name and off brand items. Groceries are limited (commissary is next door though). Plenty of electronics, kitchen supplies, clothes, military apparel and uniforms, a garden/outdoors center, recreation and exercise department, a nice tailor shop and cheap but fast haircut center. Also has a dukin donuts and a frozen yogurt place. It's got it all, would recommend a visit.< /Review>

It is an honor any time I visit Camp Pendleton.  Two of my sons served and I was visiting with one of those sons and his family.  The MCX was amazing, fun, a wonderful place to shop.</Review>

I have mixed feelings about this place. Sometimes the employees are nice to you and sometimes they're just rude and not helpful at all. Depends on who are working that day I guess. Overall, it's a good place to shop since everything is cheaper and it's tax-free.<//Text>

<Text>If you have base access, I strongly recommend shopping at the MCX. Prices are usually pretty competitive and you don’t have to pay taxes on anything in the store. Every penny spent at any MCX goes right back into the military community where you’re buying from. For instance, if you buy items here, the revenue generated goes back into MCX and Camp Pendleton<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

What did I see walking in front of me. A senior member of the Corps walking in the PX with PT gear on, you can tell this ninja just came from the gym. He walks by a Major, a freaking commissioned Officer! Nothing was said. I had to yell "so we don't correct people and maintain good order and discipline!" Nothing. We walked in right there a sign just like it was 8 years ago when I was active. "Still said No Freaking PT Gear!" I went out of my way to dress my family unit accordingly. Y'all should also.<//Review>< rate>

< Review>
It is a great place to shop if you don't mind that half the items on the shelves are not priced or priced correctly. My last visit some candles priced at 11.99 and a sign that says 25% off so the cost should be 8.99 but when you get to the register was told that the price was 15.99 and discounted to 11.99.  Same item out in town 12.50 each buy two get two free.  The other  great thing is the customer service.  There is a sign for the registers to start the line and wait for the next cashier that is open.  Standing there and notice that they are not using that sign so just get in a line at an open register.  At the "CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK" the women finishes with the customer in front of me and I start to place the items on the counter when she looks at me and as she starts to walk away and says oh this register is closed.</Review>

This is the first time I had been to the MCX on this base. I love that it was set up the same pretty much as the base in 29 Palms so I knew where everything was at and all the workers are very very nice. And all the MCX locations I've been to the bathrooms are always very clean and that's important!< /Text>

The exchange needs a new buyer. Just pick up some Valentine's candy for gift & a new blender. Nothing else. And I was in tbe mood to buy.
I will be back for Mother's day. Just to check out merchandise. I hope to C new stuff for spring or summer by then.</Review>< Pictures>

Not always fully stocked but fastest service and largest variety as far as MCXs on base. It's more civilian based than the other MCXs but you'll usually find what you need regardless. Always great customer service. Recommend going in the beginning of the week to avoid hectic, highflow hours.< /review>

<Review>NEVER USE THIS ALTERATION SHOP! just go to "dorthys" right outside the main gate. I gave then a blues coat to get new chevrons. That's it, no alterations, no dry cleaning. They had my jacket for almost a month.  But waited untill the day I was supposed to pick it up to stitch it on that morning. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the hassle.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>NEVER USE THIS ALTERATION SHOP! just go to "dorthys" right outside the main gate. I gave then a blues coat to get new chevrons. That's it, no alterations, no dry cleaning. They had my jacket for almost a month.  But waited untill the day I was supposed to pick it up to stitch it on that morning. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the hassle.</review>< pics>

As always treated with respect and courtesy! 1 small request, please make a centralized location where some of retirees can go and buy some of our old unit gear.  Some of us arent authorized into our old work spaces and are proud to have served with some of these units, and proudly want to display their Unit Pride!!  Not a complaint, just a suggestion.<//review>

Sheila and Maryana, at the MCX are excellent professional employees. Sheila the checker and Maryana, who helped get my price check done were great. They deserve recognition for excellent customer service. I truly appreciate all they did.</text>

This is a good size exchange on Camp Pendleton and has a usual good deals on electronics and some clothing and Jewelry. The best thing is the tax-free status for those that can shop there.<//text>

<text>The staff was helpful in finding what I needed. The store was stocked pretty well also. The onky issue I saw was the checkout line was to the back of the store and it only looked like 1 or 2 registers open. If that is the case there is a register by the GNC store as you go out of the door. This register is for uniform only Mon-Fri, however on the weekends it's fair game and not a lot of people in the other line know.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1547945916052</date><gmapID>0x80dc6f97bc45321f:0xbd8ad9782239694< /gmapID></record>

Big store and big selection, but you can't really expect Sailors to drive to San Diego for their gear. You've gotten better about it, but with a shop this big it wouldn't hurt to do a little better than a Navy section smaller than the booze section.<//text>

Horrible experience with this store and their return policy ! My SO got me a pair of boots 3days ago so upon trying them on , noticed a stain that’s prolly they put it in markdown to $86 and unfortunately don’t fit me that well. Went to return today , our floor isn’t carpet and my mistake that didn’t wipe the bottom of it when I tried them on just put straight back to its box.  So told them I tried them on and they keep insisting that it has been worn and disregard my issue. We will never shop in this store again. Their manager and employees has no consideration.<//Text>

When I'm in uniform, and during work hours, there is a registered that is reserved for us. This is fantastic for Marines who on a short time table and have to be back to work quickly especially during holidays when its packed with civilian shoppers.<//Review>

The girls in cosmetics aren't friendly or helpful at all, especially if you aren't inquiring about their Line. They don't offer to help with what you are looking for, their only response is, and I quote "She not here", they turn their backs and go back to talking amongst themselves.< /review>
