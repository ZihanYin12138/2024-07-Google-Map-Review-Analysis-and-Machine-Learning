<Review>Big fans!!! Fresh pasta dishes, pizza that is super tasty and authentic, fantastic wine selection, knowledgeable sommelier... We loved it all! Portions on the pasta aren’t huge so if you are hungrier, get a pizza. The ragu is super tasty.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x8085065d44d04ad3:0x5c8a199dd2540770< /gmapID></record>

<text>Delicious!

Came here for brunch with a party of 5. Pasta was amazing, flavor was pronounced without being overwhelm. And they really cooked the pasta ‘Al Dente’ as it was chewy. Pizza was also really good - thin crust and fresh ingredients. Definitely would come back again when visiting Napa.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEDgORV6jGRyPaE4mitIHOYkvi3zV1X8R0_Kxv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU17us4WfSknCyT7m-aQkKI8AcTtC0FHzbYQaF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMctoLZx3kAwfAo933tAthWFPVXRpCgcrzfJ2Id=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMghmQZci9I1PEMHb0tOeZ2jwfEeanTwTfbFmaE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1gQb00iVJ2e3EUADVGFH52hPUBZpNNHDVXJtP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7nmki6AQFJxqPk3rc26dhBg6kSYjKqHx4gtSR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeQMC5uAn4lEyYZf4fghGKudwMockbHsCW7ZeI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< date>

I just needed to share since I noticed that the waiter stole from me. He added a 15% tip that I didn't write in. Place is crazy over priced, $35 for a few chips, olives, thin slices of meat and a drink. Really unethical for waiters and waitresses to add in tips like that, it happens a lot more than you would think which is why I like to review my restaurant receipts.<//Text>

The view from the entrance includes a red statue, see below. The food overall was wonderful. The cheese plate was delicious though I personally don't like cheese enough to order at restaurants as a plate. The Myer lemon salad was extremely refreshing, simple lemon dressing with leaves slathered with cheese. Delicious! The pastas were wonderful as well, the textures of the pasta, cooked to perfection.  The pork ragu was good, the pesto ultimately was my favorite!  Had to have some cauliflower for more fiber and the tiramisu was delicious.< /Review>

The presentation was beautiful and the food was brought out quick. However, the entrees were quite pricey, and not all that tasty. Certainly not worth the $45 total that we paid. Also, the portions were very small for the price we were paying. Won't be coming again.< /text>

We showed up on time for a 7:15 reservation and were told our table wasn’t ready yet but would be in about ten minutes. Okay. Half an hour later, with both the host and his manager avoiding eye contact with us, we asked how much longer it would be. His response: “Honestly I have no idea.” We were frustrated and hungry so we went around the corner to Grace’s and had a lovely meal. Was looking forward to trying this place but will not be back now.<//text>

<time>1609861817043<//time><rate>4</rate><Review>Dined here twice in early December. Wine list featuring well-curated Italian wines of different price points. Italian wine is the foundation of California winemaking, and (sorry) but Italians do it better...so this is a perfectly placed list. I wish the abbreviated (appropriately for the Covid restaurant disaster) menu had short ribs with polenta (or similar, like, food for wine). Less pasta, and definitely no boxed pasta, which is the only reason I didn’t give five stars. Lovely place.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Ordered a pizza to go. They were supposed to call us when it was ready, however for some reason the call did not go through. We came back to pick it up and they tried to re-fire a whole new pizza for us because they care about the integrity of their pizza. We ended up taking the older one free of charge. That is customer service. Will absolutely be back.</Text>< user_id>

I took one of my best friend's for her birthday lunch (on a Sunday-I don't think they're open for lunch during the week).  The waiter recommended the Margherita pizza (and added pancetta) and the lasagna.  WOW!  They were both so amazing.  I normally wouldn't order pizza at a restaurant because I make really good homemade pizza, but the flavors and texture of their pizza were excellent.  I also normally don't order lasagna in a restaurant because it's usually too heavy, but this was light and delicious! Our cocktails were excellent also.

Excellent service, atmosphere, and experience in general. I came here with my husband and daughter, and we all loved the food we ordered (pizza and pasta). Moreover, fantastic wine! Definitely recommend this place. It may seem expensive at first, but I assure you it's all worth it.< /review>

I don't know if it was in there but the carbonara was great. I could tell there was no cream in the dish. Very silky and delicious!  The grappa at the end was perfect.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODH_YJKQflXB8zKtJVFspRIbdbmTZZ9KmQslm9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpKTe6CX8r5rdQEgfIBIDBIgCEpNfiTCwW_d68=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<time>1513740983342<//time><rating>4<//rating><text>Classic Italian food, not a huge menu. I read some reviews about bad service, our service was nice but was a tad on the slower side, most of the time we had to get his attention. Brick oven pizza always taste better but was a little too burnt for my taste. Pasta portions are small but definitely has that home made feel. A little on the pricey side, worth a try if you're in the down town area.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTA3IwWrcV3plL94M7qcOFLGyjhrT_Z_n_b2QA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkFTfZnkAA60aPn4yXODIO9YAxaqSnBt3v8WCa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeAR2MqwdUEFmJzFfLkln33YipGgpHXMlfMldJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtaW5aXX3TR573Nz42kZvXbcAx9CjCMeQzjDBa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x8085065d44d04ad3:0x5c8a199dd2540770< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Fabulous downtown Italian restaurant with great wood-fired pizzas, some really delicious pastas (go for the mushrooms!), and a few delectable seconds.  I had the scallopini and absolutely loved it.  Great wines, great local craft beers, cocktails and a very friendly staff. It gets mad crowded, so get a reservation.</Review>< time>

Excellent Italian restaurant that is always bustling so I would recommend a reservation. I did wait a little longer then anticipated on my order but it was well worth the wait.</Review>

Upon a recommendation we visited this restaurant for an early dinner.  We were seated right away despite no reservations. The food and services were SPECTACULAR. I wish I had taken more pics to try and entice others visually. Their pizza is simple, fun, and just amazing. The pasta and "meatballs" were equally delicious.  Just take this 5 star review and consider it an 8 star review and go visit Oenotri while in Napa.  I'm looking forward to  a return visit in May and a hopeful 10 star review.</Text>

< Review>
I wasn't very excited about the Panini wasn't on panini bread. The bread it was on was more of a Kaiser roll and soaked up all the flavors of the bacon and was burnt. The tri-tip inside was minimal and like I said was mostly bread, had it been served on its actual correct bread, maybe the ratio and balance would have worked. Everyone else had some form of food that was chard and burnt and others who came in after got there food before us. The salad had too much lemon on it, I just felt that the service was just not on point. Sorry guys I frequently visit Napa and I'm not sure I would go here again</Review>

I was honestly looking very forward to trying this place!! Well I did try it!  However,  I had a horrible dining experience and the manager was very rude.  Not only did they rush our table service but they also assumed that my $30 meal that I had not finished would hit the trash can vs offering to wrap the  remainder of the meal up.   It was like pulling teeth to get the manager to make me a fresh meal to take home.  I grew up in a very middle class family and it seems foolish to just assume to throw an expensive dinner away. I thought the manager was very rude and I will never go back there. They have horrible customer service and the food is really not that good.  Luckily Napa Valley has a tremendous amount of fabulous places to eat at-  go elsewhere<//text>

I can’t rave about this place enough. Coming from a very sub par yet expensive dinner the night before Oenotri really stepped up! The ambiance is great, the staff is incredible, the food is amazing, and the price is on point. Their margarita pizza is delicious and was perfectly cooked. The bartender even made us a custom strawberry tequila cocktail as we had too much wine earlier that day. I highly recommend!!!< /Text>

It had gorgonzola, balsamic glaze, and figs. We also ordered the steak, and even though it was a thin cut, the chef was able to cook it at a perfect rare. It's a small detail, but the water bottles with their logo was a cool touch. We will be back.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Can you say "Do Over"!  Oenotri is very yummy.  The house made pizzas and pastas are scrumptious.   We have eaten here several times before going to the Uptown theatre and we have traveled to Napa to just eat here.  Comfy ambiance, great service and fabulous food.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I was so excited to eat at Oenotri as they are recommended in Michelin guide and claim to offer Neapolitan pizza from the traditional stone oven. I’ve been to Naples, Italy and LOVE Neapolitan pizza. While the place was nice and full of people, the two pizzas that we ordered - classic margarita and zucchini - were not even close to the pizza I ate in Naples. The dough was NOT stretchy and chewy, but stiff. You can see the sharp edges after the bite. I wish they put more mozzarella, as I could hardly taste any, and basil leafs were also very sparse. All in all, maybe for someone that never tasted the authentic Neapolitan pizza before, it might be ok. Otherwise, don’t waste your time.</Text>< user>

<Text>The pasta was just amazing, it was fresh and the sauce was very flavorful. The pizza was very good but the pasta was so good that I wish we had gotten two different ones to try instead. It is pretty pricey for the portions but that's Napa.< /Text>< userid>

The menu is in Italian. Our appetizer was about  8 cherry tomatoes sliced in half and a drop of mozzarella cheese. I  ordered the pasta with pesto and honestly I  have had much better from the microwave.  My husband ordered the lamb and wasn't able to eat a single piece because it was so tough. Left there starving! Glad I had half a sandwich left in the hotel fridge so I could have something to eat. I had read a lot of great reviews and was expecting a great meal. We will not go back.<//Review>

<Text>As a local, this is my favorite restaurant in Napa.  Seasonal menu, and they have their own garden... that's as authentic Italian as you can get.  Also, the in-house Somm (Madison) is very nice and helpful.  Helped me pick a fantastic wine and gave me some great tips on wines I can buy at the store for good value.  I forgot the names he mentioned, so I called back and he texted me what to look for when he came to work that evening.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085065d44d04ad3:0x5c8a199dd2540770< /Gmap_id></record>

Took forever to be seated even with a reservation. The reservation was for outside but we were seated inside. Our waitress was friendly but the waitress for the table next to us would rest her butt on our table making us uncomfortable. It took a while to get water at the beginning. The food was at the level you would expect. I really loved the polenta and the main dish I had was so tasty. The food definitely made up for the service.<//review>

<review>Came here for the first time last December and had an incredible time. The atmosphere is wonderful, wine is great, service is attentive and accommodating, and the pasta was the best I've had in a long time. Everything was served family-style which I enjoyed a lot. The wait was a little longer than I typically like, but it was worth it. Absolutely would recommend!<//review><user_name>Nicole Cook< /user_name>< Pictures>

While our server was efficient and friendly, can’t say much good about the kitchen staff. Food didn’t come after an hour wait and it was cold. The pasta was soggy and tasteless. Very disappointed</review>

We had only one dinner in Napa on a short trip, so I was obsessing over where to go. We ultimately chose Oenotri because of its location close to our hotel, the unique and constantly-changing items on the menu, the more laid-back vibe, and of course, the food that gets consistently rave reviews. We chose well!

Our server was Devany, and we adored her immediately. We ordered a cocktail each, feeling a bit wined out from our first-ever tasting day in Napa, then decided on sharing the Intenso pizza and a pasta ragu with meat sauce and fusilli noodles. As a couple who generally avoids carbs, we were over the moon in love with our indulgent meal! The Intenso is a very non-traditional pizza that includes pistachios and red onions, no red sauce to be found. The pasta was literal perfection, reminded us of a rustic Old World-style pasta dish, and we about got into a fight over licking the bowl clean.

For dessert, we chose the panna cotta and it was delightful. We learned that Oenotri grows and uses many of its ingredients, including herbs, berries, and Meyer lemons, and you could taste the freshness in everything.

The service is team-style, which we really appreciated. We always had full glasses and never had any dirty plates or anything, plus everyone is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The ambiance is romantic and cozy, but very laid-back. Prices are also super reasonable, a pleasant surprise in this area. Knowing how many incredible restaurant choices there are in Napa, we would happily come back here!< /review>

<review>Our reservation was at 6:15 pm. We were running a few minutes late so I called to let the restaurant know (at 6:21 pm). The gentleman who answered the call asked for my last name and told me no problem. When we showed up at around 6:30 pm, the female receptionist at the front told us it would be another 20 min. I told her that our reservation was at 6:15 pm. She said that since we were late for more than 30 min (or they only hold the table for 30 min), basically something along that line, they sit other guests first. First of all, our reservation was at 6:15 pm, so we were NOT 30 min late. Second of all, I did call to tell them that we were a few minutes late. I informed the female receptionist that I did call at around 6:20 pm and I could even show her the phone record. She then said that she doesn’t know who I spoke to but she did not receive such a message. OK, so if your team can’t communicate, it’s NOT my fault!!!
There was another party waiting whose reservation was also 6:15 pm. Here is what I think actually happened. Our table was NEVER ready at 6:15 pm. And you know what? It’s OK, it happens. Sometimes the party before us decided to have another drink or maybe they were involved in an interesting conversation and decided to sit there for longer than expected.
Instead of just telling us that, your female receptionist basically told me that it’s my fault that she had to give away our table. It’s my 2nd time at this restaurant and I won’t be back. Food is generally good, some dishes are better than others, but hey it’s Napa Valley, plenty of other better places to dine without having to deal with unpleasant receptionist.<//review></record>

Went here back in 2015 and again this past weekend, perfectly on point both times. Excellent and unusual pasta dishes, fantastic wine list, great pizza margherita, and top-notch service (pretty sure our server’s name was Alex - awesome job). Even with the other great dining options in Napa, we’ll be back here again next time we visit.</Review>

<review>My husband and I went for the first time and we were not impressed with the food. We spend $191 for food including a $25 take out plate that was put in a tiny box for leftovers. Seriously, this was very unprofessional and unpleasant for a high  end restaurant in Napa.I work in the wine industry and guest always ask for restaurant recommendations and I will not be recommending Oenotri.

<text>They make beautiful food.   Our server was very accommodating.  Including figuring out a suitable replacement for a pizza that they used to have but no longer create due to foie gras law changes.

Great meal. Ideal portions of well-considered ingredient combinations. Excellent salads, lovely hangar steak. Dessert was good. The wine list was priced high and hard to scan because it is only available on an iPad, but we did discover a less-known Italian gem buried deep within. Overall an excellent meal.< /Review>

Service was great, wine is obviously good and ambiance is nice. Problem is their food is really mediocre. Was expecting more from the menu and other reviews.< /review>

<Text>Very good go to restaurant if you want upscale Italian food. It's probably overpriced but makes up for it in location, ambiance and unique quality of food. Some of the stuff they have you'd have to fly either to the East coast or to Italy to get.<//Text><gmap_id>0x8085065d44d04ad3:0x5c8a199dd2540770< /gmap_id>< Rating>

A really nice up-scale restaurant with a local menu. The food was fantastic and staff very friendly. The menu is great and portions are surprisingly healthy for a classier restaurant! A great choice.< /Text>

<Text>Great restaurant.  The linguini and clams were fabulous.  The clams were fresh with a hint of saltiness.  Also had a margharita pizza. Loved it. The honey gelato with an amaretto shot was over the top.  It is an Italian restaurant so the wine selection is predominantly Italian.  Not what you would expect in Napa but perfect for this restaurant.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

<userid>110154291462991579534</userid><text>Let me start by saying that the mushroom pasta dish was absolutely delicious. However, it was TINY!! I have never been to an Italian restaurant at any price point that didn't serve some sort of bread and olive oil or butter, but they did not. We were never offered wine... the waitress just took the wine glasses off of our table and the bus person served us water. We asked what the "pig face fries" are that are on the menu and received an absolutely disgusting explanation about how they "rip the meat off the skull of the pig and fry it up" to use all parts of the animal. I'm by no means a vegetarian, but it completely grossed me out, and the waitress acted annoyed that I was taken aback by her explanation and just walked away. Then... we waited for an HOUR between when we sat and quickly ordered and when our dishes came with absolutely no explanation or apology. Horrible experience. Horrible. There is clearly a very gifted chef there, though, because the tiny portions of food that we did finally receive after staring at our water for an hour were delightful. We left and literally walked directly to Gott's and ordered a second meal to share to compensate for the lack of food we'd just had. We were there on this past Sunday the 11th, 2018.< /text></record>

<review>Loud, overpriced, small portions and the service didn't impress at all. The pastas did taste good, however they were small. Napa feels like it can mark everything sky high these days because it's Napa...sad. If you want a good Italian experience go to Don Giovanni's it's worth the drive.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Stellar.  Delicious.  Very well-crafted food from fresh ingredients, and the first place in North America that my partner has loved the pasta alla carbonara!  My gigli pasta in a pork ragout was comfort food raised to an art form.  The pizza we shared for a starter was perfectly done.  Their menu selection of pizzas was a bit odd, only one appealed to us but that one turned out to be excellent.  Their menu changes daily so take my kvetching about that selection with a grain of salt, and I'm guessing they'll probably make you a custom pizza (within reason) if you ask, because it's a high-service sort of place.

Don't just look at the dessert menu if you like a drink after dinner... they have a nice assortment of excellent grappa and I'm sure many other things besides the selections mentioned on the dessert card.

It's a bit of a noisy place, with hard surfaces and a bunch of people chatting (likely about how much they were enjoying dinner) so keep that in mind if you need a quiet dinner experience, but if you want excellent food in the Italian tradition of fresh, high-quality ingredients and careful prep.  We'll be back.</Review>

Came here with my husband after a day at the wineries. Food was absolutely fantastic and cost was surprisingly reasonable considering they make everything in house with many ingredients from their garden.</review>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Food was good. The service was very slow, although our waiter was nice. Had the salami plate, the margarita pizza, and the fidei arrabiata pasta which was all really good, with the exception that the pizza was a little too burnt on the bottom. Not sure if the slow service is due to making all their own food from scratch, which is awesome.m, but it was 70min before the main course from when we sat down.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8085065d44d04ad3:0x5c8a199dd2540770< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We came here on a Saturday night as a group of 11 girls (made a reservation prior to coming). I only had the pizza appetizer, which was mediocre at best. The service here was terribly slow. We had to request our waiter to bring bread for the table at least 3 times before we actually got any. Understandably, most places do not give individual checks for large groups; however, they’ll usually let you split the check evenly among each person (i.e. 11 credit cards in this case). This place however didn’t allow that. The max amount of credit cards they would allow is “4 or 5”? In terms of food, most of my friends ordered the pasta and they all said that it was very tasty.< /Text>< rating>

I have to say I enjoyed my meal completely at Oenotri. Eggplant parmesan melted in my mouth, I I had the same sauce from the eggplant on some perfectly al dante pasta. The salad was excellent, as the greens just almost sparkled in my mouth. And the service was spot on. If you haven't been you need to go.< /Review>

<text>Ordered a bottle of 1980 Amarone and told the Sommelier I was disappointed with its taste upon opening. It was not "crocked" but somewhat sour and certainly not right. For a $345.00 bottle it should have been MUCH better. I asked staff to taste the wine and they did and said it was fine. After decanting and time the wine did not "open up" and we had a poor experience as a result.< /text><date>1367203288538</date><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is the best meal I've had in years. They make brussels sprouts magical ! The service was impeccable, the food unique, flavorful and fun. Really great that the portions were not huge, so we didn't feel wasteful. The price crazy affordable. ($6 for a good size bowl of brussels sprouts). I'm glad we got there fairly early for dinner, as the place started to fill up. Home made pasta, fresh, tasty sauces. Top notch !< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

Went here on a Friday night at 7PM with no reservation and immediately got a seat at the bar. The bartenders were excellent- friendly and approachable. I asked for a creative Saint Germaine cocktail and got an excellent drink! We loved the cresto di gallo entree and the salad was so fresh with delicious cheese all over! Great vibe!< /Text>

If this place is not a 5-stars, I do not know what is.  Imaginative dishes and preparations you will not find in many places.  All varieties of house-made items from salamis to pizzas.  Some of the best mushroom dishes I have ever had.  Reasonable prices and true to value.  The atmosphere is lively and animated but not overly noisy.  My favorite place in Napa or the Napa Valley.<//Review>

Bad service during my experience here. Food tastes good, although pricey for small portions.  It's a fancy place, so I expected that, but also expected decent service.

Long story about requesting bread, but it is available upon request. Basically, I asked for bread to go with my poached egg and it took so long even after reminding the waiter about it that I finished all of my food before it came.

When I requested to bread to go, I again had ask twice because it took so long, and when it came, he just dumped it on the other end of our 10 person group rectangular table (that's 5 ppl away from me who have no idea about this bread fiasco and weree then confused about this random box). He never acknowledged nor apologized for forgetting about anything.< /review>

Fantastic Italian in the heart of Napa - their Pizzas, pastas and meat dishes are all excellent. Fairly innovative Italian cuisine, loved it.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I had supper here while on my honeymoon.  I was tickled to find 2 of my favorite drinks (Sazerac and Vieux Carre) but my wife couldn't get her favorite drink, a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  When I told our server, Mike, this he asked what kind of vodka she liked and he didn't say anything, but we saw him at the bar stuffing olives with blue cheese and making the drink for her.  That is the kind of service needs to be recognized.  The pizza and canoli was first rate too, but thanks to Mike for going to the trouble to make a memorable moment for us.<//text>< pictures>

Came in on a Friday night for dinner around 21:00hrs and got a table for two right away. Picked out a bottle of Chenin Blanc and our waiter Damian was able to help us choose some complimenting dishes. We had the yellowfin crudo, Torchio with short rib, and Tagliatelle with shrimp.  Tuna was nice and simple and fresh, pasta for both dishes were nice and firm and had good flavor. One beefy, but not overly powering, and the shrimp had a good seafood taste, but may be too fishy for some, like my dining companion.

We had the chocolate cannoncini for dessert, described as a  croissant with chocolate cream. Was a bit harder than I expected, but soft tasting finish to the meal.  Would have preferred a darker chocolate taste.

Would return again if I was in the area.

Damian was knowledgeable about their food and made great recommendations to cater to our tarred and was pleasant throughout the whole dinner.<//text>

We visited our first night in Napa since Oenotri was one of the few places open past 8pm.  The iPad wine list was fairly extensive and featured a number of excellent, affordable Italian wines in addition to the overpriced California ones.  Needless to say, we chose a Montefalco that complemented our meat perfectly. The salumi were all terrific, the salads fresh and the meats tender. The ambiance is a bit commercial but staff were very helpful and the food was definitely worth eating.< /Review>

I was in Napa on vacation and asked Adam at the Vitners collective where he'd recommend for the best neapolitan Pizza in the area, without hesitation he effused about Oenotri.  So we tried it for dinner , and it wasn't as advertised it was transcendent!  I obsess over neapolitan Pizza, everywhere I go and including New York and my hometown of Cleveland, this is the new number one for me.  It was so good, my wife and I returned the next day for lunch and waited a half hour to be among the first to eat.  Also, tried the trompotti pasta, which was akin to eating candy, light perfectly paired with a simple cream based sauce with fresh split peas,green garlic and pesto.  The freshness of all the produce we had is hard to fairly describe, it's almost a secret weapon here.  But the dough deserves it, they even lavish a pre coat of 1 month old or less olive oil , then a second coat after baking.  between the overnite rise and the attention to detail the result is a crust that is the perfect balance of lightness and pliable crispness.  Bravo!< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Beautiful place, beautiful atmosphere. This is an Italian restaurant, so do not necessarily go for the choice of Californian wines (by the glass). This is unfortunate in my opinion. The recommendations from the server were not helpful, in spite of him specifically asking what I should not miss.

The pasta was very good, the pizza a little less. The mustard greens salad is a must in my opinion - a local ingredient that grows everywhere in Napa.

Go for the atmosphere and proximity of the hotels on First Street.

I would certainly give another chance, but there are so many choices in the center of Napa ...

Bel endroit, belle ambiance. Il s'agit d'un restaurant italien, alors n'y allez pas nécessairement pour le choix de vins (au verre) californiens. C'est malheureux selon moi. Les recommandations du serveur ne m'ont pas été utiles, malgré lui avoir spécifiquement demandé ce que je ne devrais pas manquer.

Les pâtes étaient très bonne, la pizza un peu moins. La salade de "mustard greens" est un incontournable selon moi - un ingrédient local qui pousse partout à Napa.

Allez-y pour l'ambiance et la proximité des hôtels de la rue First.

Je donnerais certainement une autre chance, mais il y a tellement de choix au centre de Napa...</Text>< pics>

HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I called today at 2:00pm a man answered. I asked him if I can schedule a appointment with Martha for highlight retouch. He said she is not taking any appointments right now. Only fist come, first serve. He told me she had a customer and it will take her 1 1/2 hrs to finish with her. So I told him that I will ne there and will wait. I got there around 2:15pm...nobody ever asked me if I needed help..so I sat down and waited for 2 hours. Martha finished with her customer. I got up thinking that I was next after being there waiting for 2 hours. A lady had just came in and Martha said she was next. Never caring that I was there waiting for so long. And took the other customer. Never again will go to this NON-PROFESSIONAL, And NON-FRIENDLY  place.< /Review>

Excellent Italian and American style sandwiches. I got the Capicola with Mozzarella, roasted red peppers, oil, vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Very tasty. Great service and price.</Text>

I love Olive It!  This is the best sandwich place around!  The salads are consistently delicious.  The staff is personable and you are always feel welcome. Leslie also makes terrific meals/soups for takeout.  She creates an incredible vegetable lasagna my family absolutely loves!  Olive It is a true Westchester gem!</Text>

Wonderful little Italian/Mediterranean deli. Sandwiches are simple with delicious ingredients, really large and really reasonable compared to a lot of places that charge $10+ for a sandwich. Glad to have this place in the area.<//text>

I was driving my girlfriend to LAX and we wanted something to eat and also fast.  We found this little hidden gem and their sandwiches are amazing.  The owner was so freaking nice to us and she gave great service. You have to try their Neapolitan sandwich, it was amazing.  Great pricing for the area and it's only 1 mile from LAX.   So if you are dropping friends or family off and just want some chill time with your love ones before dropping them, try Olive It.< /Review>

<review>All of it is only the most perfect little sandwich shop in the Westchester neighborhood
As a matter of fact, I will put their yummy sandwiches over any other sandwich shops sandwiches. The food is made with love. The omner takes care of her clients. It's a neighborhood spot. It's kid friendly. But the gosh darn food has been perfected.< /review>< user_id>

Leslie, owner of Olive It, was so welcoming upon our arrival from Charleston! She accommodated our vegan sandwich request perfectly. Great place for a quick, fresh bite close to airport.<//review>

<Review>The food here is fresh and very tasty.  Leslie and her crew are outstanding.  I try to eat here once or twice a week.  Make sure to try the broccoli salad.  If vegetables had tasted this good when I was growing up I would eaten more vegetables.</Review><time>1470252412440<//time>< Rate>

I've been coming to this place for years. Ms. Leslie and the rest of the staff are always nice and the sandwiches and sides are large and taste great! I suggest trying the broccoli /chicken salad.</review>

Ive been coming here over the years since Ive worked at LAX. Sometimes its hard to make time to find a good deli/sub shop that can make good food within a matter of minutes to get back to work so Im used to the quiznos/subway lifestyle. But I found this gem randomly when I first started using YELP and still to this day I would recommend this to anyone whos looking for authentic deli food and sandwiches. Located in westchester in the la tijera triangle plaza,owned and operated by family, they provide delicious sides and sandwiches from the #3 Ham, capicolla and proscuitto which has always been and always will be my favorite..because how can you go wrong with any sub that puts prosciutto in it?!

Now, dont get me wrong..I love this place so much but Ive noticed that yes, they have lessened the amount of meat they put on the sandwiches because my meal last week, even the 14" didnt really seem filling and I had more veggies than the meat itself. Also, since they have done more catering, which is great for them, unfortunately being only open from 11:30-5 is kind of a letdown because I think they could make just as much money if not more if they were open a little earlier because so many people at my job who have had it now would love to get an early breakfast or lunch from them. But thats the thing of small businesses and how they chose to operate.< /review>

I have been using Rytina Fine Cleaners for over a decade. My clothes come back fresh and professionally cleaned. I am a minister, so the owner cleans my clergy robes free. That is a blessing. My sweaters are professionally cleaned, folded and sent back packaged. The drivers deliver promptly. I will continue to do business with Rytina. They are the best.< /text>

I needed my graduation gown ironed/steamed. I was able to bring it in the same day, and they pushed my order through to get it back to me so I could make my pictures. They were a HUGE help! Their guest service was immaculate. I also noticed they had a great rapport with other guests (knew almost everyones name as they walked in). I will definitely be using them again, and highly recommend them to others.</text>

I've been going to Rytina Fine Cleaners for about 7 years now and I am always very happy with the service.
I work in a business casual environment, slacks or non-distressed jeans and a button-down shirt. I do not like to iron my  shirts and I am just awful with the starch spray, so I was looking for a place to press and starch my shirts.
What first attracted my to Rytina was the same day service on press and starch if the garments were dropped off by 8am, This was very attractive because of the unpredictable schedule I had at the time.
As my schedule has become more predictable I have really enjoyed the pick-up and drop-off service that comes to my office.
The shirts (and sweaters, dresses, blouses, pants when needed) are always perfectly clean and pressed.
For my time and money its a no-brainer to use the Rytina Valet app and know that my formal laundry needs will be taken care of quickly and without a lot of extra work on my part to well above my standards.<//review>

Rytina pulled off another tough one - my white linen jacket had a water mark and some dye transfer from an accident - they were able to get it all out!  This is the beat cleaner for tour every day and your special problem cleaning!< /Text>

I take my handmade quilts to Rytina when they are finished for cleaning.  They come back in a reuseable storage bag perfectly cleaned so that there is no odor of cleaning fluid.  There is both pick-up and delivery and the drivers are responsive to requests not to leave the cleaning on the porch.  The employees of this business are uniformly efficient and appropriately friendly.< /Review>

Rytina is a full service clothing and home linens cleaner, but so much more. That they’ve been in business and have been owned by the same family for decades is testimony alone to the high quality of their work and customer service. Rytina invented the concept of going above and beyond. When I discovered my handmade wedding dress had been hanging in a closet and hadn’t been cleaned for years after a mother and daughter fashion show, I took it to Rytina, who among other things specializes in the care of wedding attire. Not only did they remove some old stains and make the 30+ year-old dress look new, but they packed it in an acid-free garment box and muslin covering for appropriate storage. Proprietress Katie Brown and her team do not simply clean and wrap clothing, though. I consider Katie to be an historian who takes the time to talk with the customer about how material and vintage thread, for example, fares over time and in our climate, and what can be done to care for such pieces. In the end, I enjoy getting to know local shop owners, and it’s a pleasure seeing Danny on delivery days, or the staff when I can stop in to pick up and say hello.<//Review>

Outstanding service and attention to detail. Also, their professional, interested, and kind demeanor is very much appreciated. They are genuinely nice people. They handled a load of business suits and shirts in very short order for me with excellent results. Definitely will return.</text>

Rytina does an outstanding job on those unusual items I send their way.  Who would have thought a dry cleaner would restore doll clothes?  I sent in several pieces from my Madame Alexander doll collection.  Wow.  They brought them back to life!!  Thank you Rytina for this special service.</Text>

Efficient, flawless pick-up and delivery and, as always, the attention to detail in their cleaning is always top notch as is their service.  If you have something you love that needs special care at the cleaners, this is the place.  Also take all my linens here....a little pricey, but they get out spots I'd never be able to get out (nor have other cleaners).</review>

Not only is the customer service second to none,
the quality of work performed is as well.
The owner herself leads the calvary in this regard, she is extremely hands on with her business, I’ve pleasantly spoken to her every time I’ve dropped off and picked up.
This is the cleanest and most well maintained/professional dry cleaners I’ve experienced in my life,
Thanks Rytina Fine Cleaners for this great experience!</Text>

<review>I feel Rytina is the best Dry cleaning service in Sacramento town. They provide free pickup and delivery service. Danny who pickups and delivers the clothes is super nice and professional. I have been their customer since 1 year and they have been always consistent with their quality and pickup.delivery timings. You must definitely give them a try!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1602038688700, 'text': 'Mitul – Thank you for the kind review and we love Danny, too!

And the delivery man was kind enough to give us a call when no one was home. Shows that they truly care! I sent a silk robe & white comforter, both were extremely dirty. The silk robe was dirty with dirt/mud stains, and the comforter had nasty sweat stains lol. But we received both back in its original form as if they were brand new. I’m in love with Rytina’s service!<//text>< Pics>

<review>I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. I'm getting married in a month and I recently inspected my wedding dress and found multiple stains on it. Luckily I found Rytinas and they were so kind to me when I called to schedule an appointment. My dress was actually done earlier than I had hoped! They got the stains out of my dress and even fixed the loopholes where my sash goes because they were too loose. They even helped me out to my car to help me hang it so that my fiance didn't see my dress! (He was sitting in the driver's seat)
Very sweet staff. I will absolutely be back!<//review><Gmap_id>0x809ada550180c6b1:0x7a595b4e78afbe29<//Gmap_id>< date>

Had a bizarre order. A mattress covered in dog vomit. The outside of the mattress zips off and we were able to remove it before it soaked into the foam. Normally they do clothes, but they were willing to give it a shot. A very clean and vomit free mattress cover was returned to me with free delivery. Couldn't be happier!< /Text>

We recognize that not all dry cleaners are the same and we regularly offer a quote to first-time customers to prevent such situations.  Especially so, when they drop off large orders such as yours that included several pants, a dress, a sport coat, a comforter, and five blouses.  We are so very sorry, and in hindsight, should have insisted when the person dropping off declined our offer to price everything.  We will definitely work on that going forward.\n\nKnow that our staff has been attempting to contact you as we would hope to find some way to make you more satisfied.

A great experience everytime. The staff is excellent and make you feel welcome the moment you walk in.

They always use the best methods to care for your items. They will even reach out to specialists for items that require special attention.<//Review>

<name>Jackie Hoppa</name><review>Overwhelmed by the great service!  I dropped off a one of a kind  Dior suede coat as a last resort, The coat is chartreuse green and was covered was with lipstick stains from my daughters photography class shoots.  Rytina was very clear on the expectations  that with the stains would be a challenge and could  not guarantee the results . They were also upfront that the cost would be $140.  Since  I as prepared to trash the coat , I figured I would invest in the $140.  I just picked up the coat- every stain is gone and it looks brand new!  Thank you Rytina - and standing ovation to your suede and leather cleaner!!< /review><user>117968192275983684730</user>< response>

<review>We’ve been with Rytina for a few years. They do a wonderful job with our clothes and their customer service is impeccable. We have them deliver and pick up from our home which is not in a convenient location. They have always come and gone with no hesitation and with a positive attitude. We have an added complication with our dogs where many other companies make us lock them up on their days. Not Rytina! All the drivers took the time to get to know them and we never have to worry. We couldn’t be happier.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809ada550180c6b1:0x7a595b4e78afbe29< /gmapID></record>

Danny the delivery driver is outstanding! He always goes above and beyond to make sure the customer is happy.  I love the communication they provide and the attention to detail!  I know that when I send my clothes out for dry cleaning, laundry, or even repair, I don't even have to think about it... Because I know it'll be done quickly, professionally and correctly!

Our family has been using Rytina exclusively for years. They did a beautiful job cleaning, prepping, and boxing my wife's wedding dress for storage. They've brought back to life old garments and stained table cloths. They have meticulously cleaned and pressed everything from dress shirts to blouses while replacing buttons now and then without saying a word or charging for the additional service. We're life long customers here!< /Text>

They have a very nice place and do a fantastic job. However, for the everyday Joe it's too high of a price. I had two shirt laundered, a two piece suit and a dress dry cleaned. It came out to a little under $80.</Text>

<review>Overall great experience with Rytinas. They picked up my comforter and delivered in within a couple days and I am very satisfied with thier quality of work. I rated them 4 stars because they are double the price I have been paying elsewhere and as convenient as that is, it's not worth the extreme price difference.

We’re glad that you appreciated our attention to detail and quality, but am wondering if perhaps we didn’t review some of the differences in our services and our sample pricing when you first dropped off?\nWhile we are not the most expensive dry-cleaning business in the Sacramento area, we recognize that we are above the average and strive to offer every customer real value for the prices we charge. We understand that people make a substantive investment in their wardrobe and see the clothes that they wear as an extension of their image and how others see them. Properly caring for that investment is something we take seriously, and we utilize best practices, quality products, and skilled and knowledgeable staff to meet our customer’s quality expectations.\nWe’d like to reach out to you to discuss your experience and address this matter.'}</resp>

Also, please note that difficult stains require attention by our technician and often need multiple cleanings during treatment.  As such, we’d appreciate if we could have a couple of extra days to work on the garment to be certain that we haven’t overlooked anything.\n\nAgain, thank you for your feedback and we look forward to the opportunity to review your blazer further.'}<//resp>

Dangerous service drivers. Probably shouldn't have your guys blowing through stop signs and tailgating people in company vehicles. Almost rear ended the truck ahead of me by trying to get ahead in a turning lane they were both going into as well.

Not a good look.<//Text>

As a male, this place is awesome. They're dirt cheap and they know exactly what i want, a good clean up.  They take walk-ins. Its always busy though, so i would hive them a call if you are on a time crunch.< /review>

Nice clean place, only $11 I think for eyebrows. Usually busy so the wait can be awhile. Also was kinda offended when she was about to start on the rest of my face without my permission. She seemed surprised I didn't want my whole face threaded.< /Text>

This place is nice and clean looking but for the price I feel that the lady could of done a better job on my eyebrows and she got a little cut on my upper brow. :(   I felt rushed with the over all experience especially when this was my first time getting threaded.< /Review>

<Review>The old lady that works there is the rudest person I’ve ever encountered in a retail store! Acts like she knows all and in reality she doesn’t. Unless you speak to a manager and deal with the same person through the whole process, good luck getting good service. Will never shop at the Ircutt store ever again!<//Review>< GmapID>

Apparently they can't get a crew to show up on time in the morning. Sign says they open at 7:30 but myself and two other customers are standing here at 7:45 and the doors are locked an no one's around...< /review>

This bar is incredible! they have a variety of mouth-watering homemade infused liqueur, drinks inspired and influenced from the prohibition era and the food is spot on! Had such a great time, and of course all the tables are socially distant, and the staff are all masked.
Will go again!!</review>

Get the old fashioned, or the bees knees, or the rosemary infused gin, or the amazing sangria, or any of the ideal local craft beers. Honestly order everything it's all amazing!</review>

<review>This rating is based solely on the bar. Not the food or then they would lose a star. The head bartender is very knowledgeable about the drinks and executes very well in making them.  The place has a prohibition era vibe to it. Dark, classy, and loungy. There was live music with a singer and guitar players. My friend and I went to this place two nights in a row. I recommend the whiskey sours. Eat or get food somewhere else though.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.

Also-if you're pro PPE /social distance, then don't sit at the bar or maybe not come at all. No one , except the employees wore masks in here. I didn't care but I know there are others who do care and are extreme about it.< /review>< Pictures>

If you're in old town Oxnard this is a must visit for great food and spirits. The reason this place is called the 1901 Speakeasy is the building that houses both the Italian restaurant, La Dolce Vita, and the 1901 Speakeasy, was actually built in 1901. Enjoy!<//text>

The bartender helped me find a drink I would like which he aged himself. And then I sat and read a book. The vibe is amazing and took me back to feeling like I was living in the 1950’s. I will definitely frequent this place.<//Review>

The 1901 Speakeasy is indeed cool. They have excellent adult beverages & beautiful music. Also, upstairs is La Dolce Vita Italian food they will bring down or you can go up.<//review>

<Review>Van Dam Farms is awesome. They're like the old fashioned hardware store that has what you need. I can go to Lowes or Home Depot and NOT find what I'm looking for and go to Van Dam Farms and find it. Though they're small, they're stock of stuff is amazing. AND it's not a zoo like the bigger places. Great customer service too! Great place!<//Review>< Date>

This establishment has high end merchandise and the best staff you could ever hope for who will assist you in locating items and providing advice.  "Service" means something to their staff.  Give them a try.  You'll be relieved that you did.  Oh, and no worries.  They dont "prey" on people seeking convenience by jacking up their prices like a lot of enterprises commonly do.  ;)<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c25c62c511ceab:0x3def83b879957d93</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Handy to have a hardware store in the neighborhood. I usually see the same guy at the register. He's friendly, and he knows where everything is. That's a huge plus compared to the big home improvement centers where you have to search for an employee in order to get directed to the employee who knows where to find the thing you need.<//text>

A huge shout out to the gentleman who closed the store today. I arrived at 1:02, and the store was already closed, though the Open sign was still on and the hay gates were open. To be fair, I was 2 minutes late, and the registers were closed. When I explained that I REALLY needed hay today, due to my own bad planning, so that my goats would not be hungry tonight, he kindly let me buy the hay. I so appreciate his time and extra effort for customer service. Thank you!</text>

Nice and clean gym but very small and everything is very close together. I would go here if I lived close and in a pinch but prefer the larger locations for regular workouts.<//Review>

Smaller than most gyms Im used to, although, the machine variety is very nice and the staff are always eager to help. All in all a very cool gym and a nice place to get some gains!<//Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>I really liked this gym when I first started here and now I just seen it become a mess. There are cycling bikes on the 2nd floor but when there's a class in session you can't use them and there aren't any anywhere else. Also there's 14 treadmills (total) and 4 of them are not working so that leaves 10 and it gets packed in here especially after 5 so usually I don't even get to use one. The elevator to the restrooms is broken (still, it's been since I started coming here 6mths ago) so overall it's not that great. The crowd is nice lol but they can really improve and maybe add cycling bikes on that random bridge that leads to the bathroom, it's useless space.

Update: the women's sauna is now also out of order

Update update: I have now cancelled my membership lol< /Review>< Pics>

As the general public recognise los angeles health is a No-Frills health club. Their gadget is broadly speaking updated and pretty precise stuff. The membership and Mid Wilshire that I visit is in determined want of every version. The carpets are antique and some of the device desires to be up to date. either humans that paintings there are very first-class and helpful. it's in no way too busy that I cannot get on Ana machine though.</Review>

Since COVID, I have been trying to cancel my membership. I've sent them the letter they requested, I've emailed them at least 3 times and called which is a recorded message that hangs up on you.  i've asked my credit card to block them as a vendor as there is no way to stop them from charging me. They show I have a 85 dollar balance for months in June and July.... I have been trying to cancel this since March 2020.

Do yourself a favor and skip this establishment. If they have no way for you to cancel your membership, you are basically signing up for a company that appears to make it impossible to cancel your membership so they get free money from people who aren't even using this establishment anymore.

Fix your cancellation policy.... if the only way is by mail or in person and you aren't receiving my mail (lucky coincidence) and have no gyms open or staff to answer calls.... then you shouldn't be in business. I have a feeling this franchise will be dunzo after COVID, which in all seriousness might be for the best.< /text>

They've always been nice to me and recently were very kind and understanding when I had some issues making a payment. Staff members like Dane take pride in their work and are true professionals.. a very kind and honest man I might add. The staff there always makes sure you are taken care of and they ask the right questions to help you find what's best for you. The gym has a sauna, machines, free weights, plated weights, outdoor exercise area, private section for personal training, cardio, aerobic/boxing studio . This LA fitness does not have a basketball court or racquetball courts which would be a plus but I am happy with the amenities I have. I really love that they have punching bags as they are really helpful to me getting a complete workout. The gym is very sanitary and neat. The majority of the members seem to be very respectful and kind. I plan on using this gym as long as I am living here in the miracle mile area!</review>< pictures>

Some of the machines are a bit old and worn, and you may end up having to wait for one if you're here at a busy time, but the staff is friendly and it's a welcoming atmosphere. I do wish they'd have cleaning wipes available for the machines, at the moment the only way to wipe them down is with some thin paper towels which really don't do much to disinfect. Especially during flu season it's a bit gross.< /review>

Better just opt for a nice run or hike. The place is very affordable but this comes with a lot of time wasted waiting for weights, in an overcrowded setting and obviously the cleaning lady at the same time. The gym operators do not take pride in what they do - I’ve been in hundreds of different gyms across the states but this is the first time the soap in the shower smelled rotten.</Text>< Pictures>

LA Fitness, Los Angeles, California

I was a member of Bally's for many, many years, however, one day they shut down and LA Fitness took them over and has done such a Fantastic Job Ever Since!

I am a Proud Member of LA Fitness where You Can Develop Your Body Into Being The Best That You Can Be!

Their gyms have many things to do such as aerobic classes, weight training, zumba classes, yoga classes, swimming pools, boot camp classes, body conditioning classes, etc.

You can Never get bored at LA Fitness!

I just started going back because I need to Lose Weight and I have been going every day taking their Zumba and Yoga Classes and I am more than sure that My Body Will Be Changing Very Soon For The Better!

I really enjoy coming to LA Fitness and they definitely have programs to suit All Of Your Body's Needs!

In the following pictures, I was taking a Zumba Class with Gloria Jimenez who is one of their Top Instructors.

I want to personally Thank Gloria Jimenez for allowing ME to take pictures during her most recent Zumba class back on Monday, November 6, 2017!

Sincerely yours,

===========================================================
Update:

This is what I call My Home Gym!

I go to the miracle mile LA Fitness quite often because it is so convenient to my home.

I really like what they have to offer there.

Yes, they have a Pool, Free Weights, Bikes, but their Classes that I take are amazing which include Body Conditioning, Yoga and Zumba.

I do these quite often because I am trying to lose weight.

I know that losing weight takes time, but with LA Fitness and All Of The Motivation that I Get From Their Classes and Members and Instructors, this Can Be Made Possible.

I want to Thank LA Fitness for being there for ME when I needed You Most such as back on Wednesday, December 6, 2017.

Sincerely yours,

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I do not recommend anyone to get membership at La fitness.
First, I’ve had my membership for about a year and worked out at different location in Los Angeles, the gym is always so crowded, the locker rooms are dirty.
Second, I signed up for membership about a year ago with no commitment and month to month deal. Now my new apartment has a gym so I decided to end my membership. The only reason I have had the membership for this long is the location convince and fair price. The process to cancel your membership is so complicated and long. I’ve been trying to reach out but no one is there to help.<//Text><user_name>Samuel Zerihun<//user_name>< response>

<UserId.>111370570272896347716< /UserId.><Review>usually I don't give bad reviews to places, but maybe it's the only way  to make them STOP charging my membership that I have canceled  last year in person! I had to open a dispute with my bank and it's 2020 now and LA Fitness still keep calling me to annoying charging for something that I had canceled. It does not make sense.
I canceled because I did not like the classes offered. A few times they canceled classes last minute because the teacher was not coming. Also they don't used to have good classes. If you want a cheap gym, ok go for that. But be careful because they will never let you go!!!!<//Review>< Response>

This gym is kind of small, and sometimes it's dirty, and sometimes the AC doesn't work. Aside from that, it gets the job done. I only go for classes but the gym itself looks like it has all the basics that you would need because I always see so many people here. Maybe it's because it's kind of small. Classwise, I only go to one on Saturday and the parking is fine. They validate for 2.5 hours. Parking on weekdays is difficult because you have to figure it out amongst the people who actually work in the building. I enjoy the view of LACMA from the class room. The mats don't seem like the most sanitary so I bring my own and use theirs if I have to. During class, sometimes you'll get a person on the bike behind you but they're pretty quiet.<//Text>

Kettleballs only for PT, not enough racks, hard to get equipment. Worst was that staff at different LA fitness will tell you different rates for different plan options. LA fitness needs more straightforward pricing for their plans..... Make sure to ask what options are promotionally priced because they won't tell you.</review>< pics>

As most people know LA Fitness is a No-Frills Health Club. Their equipment is mostly up to date and pretty good stuff. The club and Mid Wilshire that I go to is in desperate need of every model. The carpets are old and some of the equipment needs to be updated. Either people that work there are very nice and helpful. It's never too busy that I cannot get on Ana machine though.<//review>

<review>I had a training session with Shay yesterday. I have worked out for 25+ years and always had issues with breathing. After 1 session she was able to not only help me with my breathing but also how it works with my movement. Excellent time spent. Thank you!

I've also been working with Vincent and Tony and the experience has also been great. Motivation and diet has never been an issue its been coming up with better routines and exercises which are better for me personally. These guys have solid knowledge, know how to apply it and customize a workout.
I'm getting a lot out of my time spent with the team!<//review>< Pics>

I'm embarrassed to say that I kept my membership here for 10 years out of convenience and proximity to my house. This is one of the dirtiest gym facilities I've ever seen. The locker rooms are unsanitary and unusable. The equipment is rarely, if ever, cleaned. The staff sits around eating burgers and fries at their desks in front of people working out, trying to be fit. Most of all, every year when it gets warm the air conditioning breaks. Although this year, it's not even warm and the air conditioning has been broken for weeks. It's frequently hotter inside than outside. Elevators are constantly broken  for long periods of time - for the disabled this is a huge issue. This place should be shut down by the health department. Find another gym at all costs - you will not be motivated to workout here. If I could give "0" stars I would!<//text>

I really dislike LA fitness. I just cant afford a nicer gym. The bathrooms here are disgusting and the sauna is made for 2 people, maybe 3. There are a few high end LA fitnesses around here and this is definitely not one of them.<//text>

It's my personal gym! It might be small but you get a familial vibe to the gym. I love it.  It's great to go in the mornings. It's not that crowded then. But overall , It's a great place to get in shape and reach your fitness goals.<//Text>

This LA Fitness location has NO CAMERAS AND THE STAFF STEALS!
The employees are ghetto and don’t even know the rules for their own work environment!
I’ve been to every single LA Fitness location in Los Angeles county and sadly this is the worst. SHOCKING because the location is not bad but the employees and manager just don’t care about their jobs at all and everyone is following their own rules and judging eachother. No structure or care.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Total dump! The sales team outright lie to potential new members. Elevator never works, 80% of lockers have no doors and insides are never cleaned (you will get a staph infection for sure). They closed the wet steam room which was only plus to gym.  Equipment gets broken and is broken for months.  Homeless mentally unstable people are allowed in lockers and get in fights.  Rusty sauna works about half the time.  The city should do bacteria testing.  They never clean and at night and Sundays it is absolutely disgusting.  They took away paper towels in locker room so nobody can clean up after shaving.  Only positive is front desk staff always seems to be friendly.  Manager is total waste of space!<//Review>< date>

<review>Very dirty gym. I was surprised because of the area the gym was in. I got a day pass for $15 and walked around the gym and asked for my money back but I couldn’t because it was finals sale. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for a better environment. Equipment is old and not good quality, no towels, and dirty surfaces all around.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

In perfect LA-Style, you’ll be surrounded by self-centered, selfish and inconsiderate members who love to:

1. Talk loudly on their phone for 20+ minutes while using the treadmill near yours

2. Play videos on their smartphones with no headphones. So we can all enjoy what they’re watching

3. Hog equipment while checking their email or doing God knows what on their smartphone. If you ask them if they’re using the machine, they give you dirty looks and continue using their phone.

4. Talk loudly to their companions, while working out.

Meanwhile the people working there do NOTHING to monitor and control these issues.

It’s too bad because I like the location and size of this gym. The only non-people issue I have with it is that the air/AC doesn’t work. It’s like a steam sauna on hotter days.</Review>< pictures>

I go to this LA fitness now. The staff  is very nice 👏. I used to go to 9100 Wilshire Blvd STE 100E Beverly Hills CA 90212. I changed because they hired horrible staff, especially for the front desk in the afternoon and evening. They are SO RUDE. The difference between the two locations is abysmal.< /review>

Pretty much the worst LA fitness in the area. As I write this the AC is broken or they refuse to use it, the water fountain is broken, and the elevator is broken. Pro tip don't be handicapped and needing water at this gym. Equipment is old, frequently broken, and generally all dirty.

Edit: the problems here are even worse when you see how well the other LA fitness in town operate. Management should be removed. Every other place has AC on, staff constantly cleaning, nothing broken<//text>

You get what you pay for so in that sense LA Fitness is a bargain. It can get crowded during peak hours but you can always 'work in' if someone is using your favorite equipment and from what I've seen there's no waiting for most of the cardio machines. I live close by so I don't have to deal with parking and I don't need to use the locker room (thank god). There's a row of big screen HD tv's usually tuned to news and sports. The staff seems nice enough.So if you're looking for a fast, no frills work-out this is probably the place for you.< /text>

This is the worst gym in LA, managed by the absolute most incompetent employees any gym could hire. Nothing ever works and it takes them months to repair anything. Ripoff central, hosted by terrible, inconsiderate employees - a horrible experience all around.</text>

I like the equipment even if it’s considered outdated... the only equipment I am not a fan of here are the treadmills but everything else is great. The staff have always been pleasant to me. The only thing I am not a fan of is the locker room. It’s not the cleanest and I always find the restrooms trashed for whatever reaps. But other than that this gym has what you need.</Review>< Pictures>

This is a "you get what you pay for" kind and of gym. Equipment is pretty old and the whole place is not exactly clean, but they have everything you need for a workout and the price is tough to beat< /review>

<Text>Not a very nice gym at all. I was expecting a lot more. Most La fitness are a solid 4 stars. This is in a nice area in town, great views, but inside the gym is not great. All the equipment is old and some are broken. Very unorganized and no weights put back in correct spot. Fortunately it's only $35 a month so I should lower my expectations I guess. Cliental is a good normal crowd. Everyone seems to keep to themselves and workout.  Only giving it 2 stars because it has parking which is nice.

Edit: bathrooms are terrible. 1 star.</Text><time>1495227563605</time>< Rate>

This poorly run gym also rubs off on individuals working out there, who tend to be totally unfamiliar with any semblance of gym etiquette. The only thing I would give this place credit for is that the front end staff tend to be friendly. Bottom line, my guess is this gym is run by some investor who wanted to park their cash and had no real interest in running an actual gym.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This gym has a weird policy of cancellation.

When I went to cancel my gym membership on Saturday, the person sitting at the front desk told me that cancellation happens only during weekdays. So, I went to the gym on a weekday after my work to cancel it, there I am told that I can cancel only during working hours that is 8-5 (are you kidding me!!!) as that's when Operation Manager Nicki is available in the office, and she is the only one who handles cancellations. I told them I cannot come during those hours and asked them that there gotta be another way to cancel the membership too. Then they told me that I could send a mail to Sacramento office through USPS mail (this was the height of craziness). I have joined so many fitness clubs but never heard of this policy.

During this process, it took me 7-10 days and my next month's charges got deducted from my credit card. My wife took a couple of hours off from work and went to the gym on weekday office hours to meet Nicki and cancel the membership.
Later, I asked Nicki (operations manager) to refund the amount for the month that got deducted during this process. She refused and said that I canceled my membership after the billing cycle generated. I told her that I am trying to cancel the membership for last 10 days and because of this weird policy I got suffered. She did not listen and did not process my refund.

The funniest part is that they do not have any time constraint when you join the gym. I joined the membership on 31st Dec at 9:00 pm. At that time nobody asked me to come between 8 to 5. The person who signed me up for the membership was offering me many promotional offers, looked like he desperately wanted to complete his monthly quota of membership sign-ups.

I want everybody to think twice before joining this gym.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>Incredibly overcrowded,  the weights were so disorganized and all over the place half of the time I was there i was just trying to find the proper dumbbells. Paper towels littered the floor and when we went up to the cycling room where we were told we could use even if we weren't in a class (which granted at the time we showed up there was a class of 2 going on) we were scolded for entering. The staff at the front was incredibly friendly and helpful but unfortunately the rest of the gym wasn't the same quality. If the space had been larger and things didn't feel so crowded that would be a different story but honestly not my best experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I frequent 3 LA Fitness gyms in the area depending on how much time I have to travel to one of the gyms. This is most convenient for me yet is the worst one in LA. Most of the equipment is old and at some points troublesome to use. Count on waiting for equipment or space and altering your work out all the time based on busyness. The air conditioner works only less 50% of the time. They try to use fans to help when it doesn’t work but I feel the fans make it hotter and super humid bringing in the hot air from outside. The layout of the equipment is odd split between 2 floors and there is no decent space for stretching or floorwork.You have to check out dumbbells less than 20lbs which is rather annoying. The staff is sub par. I see the front desk person and they are usually off putting, in welcoming and mostly annoyed you walked in. They are the least excited people worse than the DMV. I would skip this gym if you live in the area and take the extra few minutes to go to La Cienega or even Overland. It will make you feel like you’re payment for memberships is worth it. This one feels like I’m paying way too much for sub par conditions and staff. My hope is they remodel and update this place.</Review>

The dumbbell section is incredibly disorganized and reflects on the laziness of the people that go to that gym. The people that work the front desk are clearly there to get a paycheck and that’s it. They don’t seem to care about the quality of the gym. I literally watched 10 people grab weights from the correct spot (after I personally organized them) AND THEN PUT IT IN THE WRONG SPOT (10s in the 45s) vice versa. Basically your typical commercial gym bs you have to deal with. Parking was easy though, you just park around the area or you can go park in the lot and it’s free with validation<//review></record>

<text>To be honest, this gym is not as bad as I expected it to be. It is like walking through a maze just to get basically anywhere... Especially to the locker room. Speaking of the locker room, there is a grimy over all dirty feeling to the locker room - but it isn't actually dirty. I think it just needs to be upgraded.<//text>< Pictures>

I wish I could post pictures here. After deciding to go to a location (Hollywood/El Centro)  that was closer to home closer to home I am mortified by every aspect of this gym. From the filthy and bizarre layout to the fact that major sections had missing doors, the creepy snakelike rat maze you take to cross a bridge to another building is absurd.
The machinery was different than most I’d seen at El Centro. One in particular had such a layer of grime on the instruction diagram it was impossible to read or see a thing.  The stifling temperatures of this location are another thing. I’m able to work out at my best I’m a well ventilated air conditioned gym. The stagnant mugginess both in the locker room and gym make the outdoor bridge between them a refuge. I couldn’t imagine going there in the middle of a hot summer day. Even at 9pm it’s stifling warm.</review>

LA Fitness is the cheapest gym you can go to in the area. You get what you pay for so this gym is medicare. The place is kind of clean. The equipment is kind of new. The staff is kind of nice. This gym offers treadmills, weights, weight machines, spin class, yoga, Pilates and a handful of other workout courses.  Free 2 hour parking in the building.< /Review>

<Review>Not an ideal gym to go to.  The steam room smells like mildew.  The dry sauna is not hot at all.  The showers are disgusting.  The locker room is in shambles.

I recommend you go elsewhere if you are an LA Fitness member.  This place shares a building and parking lot with the office upstairs.

The staff here suck.  They have attitude problems and need to check themselves.  I'm surprised that this place is still standing.  I have a hunch that this is where fitness careers go to die.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b93cdd73aca7:0x8519b711fea37ea9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I can't say that any of the LA fitnesses I have visited have been okay. This one on Wilshire in LA is decent but the lady leading the Tuesday night class was horrible. I felt like it was such a waste of time. She didn't know how to teach, she didn't count down properly, she had the music way too fast and we were slinging weights all over the place to the point that it was unsafe. I finally stopped doing what she was doing and did my own thing during the class. I'm not sure why they keep her as an instructor.

The gym is small, which is fine and it seems that most of the equipment is okay compared to other LA Fitness is where most of the equipment is broken. However there are not nearly enough mats for Pilates, yoga and other classes. If you want a mat you have to go around the gym to see if you can find one and there's probably less than 20 in the whole gym.

I spoke with a member who has been attending that gym for several years because she lives nearby. She says they always struggle to keep good instructors. I only tried it out because it's closer to my house but I like the instructors at the La Cienega LA Fitness much better. If this LA Fitness obtain some good instructors I would definitely want to return.</Review>

<review>They permanently shut down the one saving grace about this place: their steam room. But the gy does serve an area that I think is severely underserved, so it gets an extra star for that.

However, it's tiny, the locker room/bathroom is always gross (believe it or not, some gyms do a really good job at keeping this area clean), and the only remaining "amenity" now is a lukewarm sauna that fits maybe 5 people.

If you don't live in the area, make the trip to another location. And even if you do live here, maybe make the trip elsewhere anyway.< /review>< pics>

The most disappointing club I've ever been a part of. The Office manager @ LA Fitness Miracle Mile Adrian does not know what he is talking about and only believes in selling to potential customers. Ridiculous customer service after point of sale.
I've been trying to add a few amenities to my account and they say that it's not possible and I'd have to cancel my service, pay the $298 initiation fee again and only then I'd be able to get those amenities.

He connected my with their corporate account management and they were useless too.

They really do not know what is logically right for their customers. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING.< /Text>

I like that the gym is easy to find. I like that in the morning there isn't a lot of people so its easy to get your workout in. I like that there is a lot more machines for your upper body than other gyms. I also like that the gym is clean.</review>

Weight and workout facilities only....par for the course.   As a "gym" it's very awkwardly laid out, with locker rooms in adjacent building, and VERY stupidly designed lockers...style over functionality at its least practical.   No pool, no jacuzzi, and after the steam room broke down several times in 2016...corporate has decided "no steam" either.   The only "luxury" is a small sauna that's a crowd with six people and not even hot. -  None of this describes the two Hollywood LA Fitness gyms, which DO have all the trimmings.  So, if all you want to do is work out and go home, with no sense of the "spa experience" whatsoever, then you'll be fine with the 5950 Wilshire location.  One nice touch is that the cardio machines look out across a pond (corporate concrete) to the front entrance of LACMA, where the action never seems to stop.   Compared to other LA Fitness gyms all over Los Angeles, my Two Star vote is being generous.<//Review>

Mens locker rooms are fine, nothing high end, but if you want to lock your stuff, take a shower and get out, they work perfectly, and although not astetically pleasing, they are, in fact, clean! And the sauna is nice and hot! The gym has all equipment you'll need for a comprehensive workout. It is only busy durring peak hours, like every gym ever! Even then, you're never waiting too long for a machine. I don't attend the classes, but the staff is friendly and helpful. They validate parking for two and a half hours. It's definitely a no frills experience, but if you're patient and time it right, they often have good deals on memberships. And it'll allow you to use most of the la fitnesses across the country.

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the elevator is constantly broken,   and makes it a bit of a hassle to get to and from the parking lot. But even then, it's like 30 secs out of the way, so nothing crazy, I just would like to see that fixed. If I could give 4 and a half stars, i would<//review><user>115503514377179925292< /user></record>

I hate LA fitness, but this one gets 3 stars instead of 2. It's got to be the oldest gym there is, it's on Wilshire by BH, and has never been remodeled. Why an extra star? Everyone there is like 60+yo, so I don't feel bad about being almost 30<//text>

<text>The only good thing about this gym is Drone the personal trainer.
They are all friendly when they try to sell you a membership then they totally ignore you.
I had an accident there and nobody moved a finger.
The equipment is old and the locker rooms stink.
Do yourself a favor and go to the one on LaCienega instead.
Rude staff...most of them don't even say hi to you when you walk in.
I am never setting foot in that building ever again.
Boycott!!!!< /text>< response>

Probably the worst LA Fitness in LA. The equipment is outdated, there’s never enough weight plates, and it’s typically overcrowded.

It’s just immediately less impressive than all other locations I’ve been to as far as the equipment and organization.</review>

This place is horrible. I'm definitely not a gym snob, I just needed a place where I could walk on the treadmill for a bit, since I am in my second trimester of pregnancy. This place is horrible because of the people who go there.  It seems to be frequented by people with narcissistic personality disorder and crappy plastic surgery. Almost every time I go to use the treadmill, my workout is ruined by some idiot who feels the need to have a public conversation on their cell phone at full volume, just in case the rest of the gym doesn't pay enough attention to them.
For instance, today I was about five minutes into my workout when some trashy fat lady got on the treadmill next to me and began face timing with her equally idiotic boyfriend in Russian.  Face timing.... at the gym.... on the treadmill. I had my headphones on, but she was so loud that I couldn't hear anything over her conversation. I finally asked her politely if she could keep it down a bit, since she was two feet away from me and was creating a racket.  She told me this was her personal space and I could move if I didn't like it. Remember, I'm five months pregnant and quietly going about my own business before fat ass decides to grace me with her presence. I hope she gets herpes of the eye off the equipment.
30 seconds later, another heathen gets on the treadmill on the other side of me and started her own "Miss Thang" conversation at full volume. "Giiiiiiiirl, did you see Beyonce last night!!" blah, blah, blah blah.... so now Fat Russian turns up her volume even louder to compensate.  Now I have two idiots blathering away on either side of me. I just had to give up.
This has happened to me in some variation almost every time I come to this place.  I complained to the staff, and although they acknowledged their client's rude behavior, they said they were sorry but they had no rules against loud cell phone use. They need to change their policy if their clientele have such little class. They gave me the number to their corporate office so I could lodge a formal complaint, but when I called I got a recording which then just repeatedly hung up on me.
Next time this happens to me, I'm going to download the hymnals station on Pandora and sing along to it at the top of my lungs.  Let's see if they have a policy against that.< /Text>

It's too small and crowded, to go to showers and restrooms you have to get out the building to go to another building and all sweaty at night could be annoying and you can get sick< /Text>

(Translated by Google) For now it's my gym floor, it's clean, there's a good atmosphere, etc. Even though several negative points are the parking lot and the people who are going to train, it would seem that they are more focused on their phones than exercise.

Por ahora es mi gimnasio de planta , está limpio, hay buen ambiente, etc. Aún que varios puntos negativos son el estacionamiento y que las personas que van a entrenar parecería que están más enfocados en sus teléfonos que el hacer ejercicio 👎.</text>

Business lunch for four of us.  Food was very good and the service was outstanding.  We were served by the owner who was so incredibly kind and attentive.  So very hard for restaurants to stay in business during covid. This is a great option for authentic Lebanese food.  Please take the time to eat here. You won't be disappointed.</text>

<Review>The folks at Kabogee Grill have such great chefs and all the food always tastes amazing.  You can feel the love by how delicious the meals are, so flavorful and yummy.  We especially loved their homemade dressing.  It’s terrific on their salad but good enough to use on lots of other dishes!  Thank you! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽< /Review>< pics>

The chicken in the photo is "shawarma". Yikes. The only redeeming quality about the "pita" is that it was warm. Hummus was decent at best. At least the salad was good, but it was the best part of the meal.< /text>

< review>
Kobobgee Grill made my taste buds dance! I stuck with the Mezzas …hummus, muhamarah, and warak inab (stuffed grape leaves).  I’m still salivating while writing this review. This is seriously great food. Most people think they’ve eaten hummus. Grocery store hummus bears little resemblance to the real thing. Kabobgee’s hummus is smooth and rich and plate-lickable. Happily it and the muhamarah (really where has this been all my life!)  is served with minutes old pita. OMG the pita, fresh, hot, thin, with a crisp crust.  Back to the muhamarah, most people have never tasted this sweet, tart, rich, concoction of walnuts, mild red pepper, pomegranate and other mystery ingredients. Order it. And then place an order to take home so you don’t have to share. Speaking of not sharing, I had intended to share my warak inab with my friends. After one lemony, savory, yummy bite—no way. These are stuffed grape leaves like mama would have made if mama was Middle Eastern. Why are you still reading? Ge thee to Kobobogee!< /review>

Food does not taste good. Far away from being a good Mediterranean restaurants.  The chicken shish kabab tasted like bad meat and i left it on the plate. Hummus tasted like cardboard .Stay away<//review>

<Review>Always excellent.  Baba Ganoush better here than anywhere else.  Gyros also a favorite.  Fish and chicken dishes fresh, of course, delicate flavors shine.  Service quick, friendly.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Amazing Lebanese restaurant.  Even better than the ones in Glendale, where there's a large Lebanese and Armenian community.  Nabih is the owner and a one of the nicest people you'll meet.  We love coming here and always do when we get a chance</text>< gmap_id>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I like this place. I have been to this place quite a few times now.

The best part I like here is those hot pita bread and hummus which is being served before your order arrive. Some time I feel that skip lunch or dinner and just keep going on with those pita bread and hummus.

My personal favorite is Vegetarian Makhlubi and Jallab(rose water and dates drink).< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>This is the best Lebanese food I've had in 30 years. Grew up in a Lebanese restaurant...so I know real food.

They use the best and most fresh ingredients and have standards, that I have only seen in Michelin Star rated restaurants without paying the High Prices!

I have filled up for $10 to $20, on average.

They even went out of their way to make a complicated dish of a special stuffed eggplant dish as a special order.  They went out and bought the ingredients and it was ready when I came in at a scheduled time

Great Decore and atmosphere and this is a favorite place for all the nearby business folks.

Give these guys a try.  You definitely will not want go any place else after eating the best lebanese food in town.

Very Fresh baklava too<//Review></record></dataset><record>

It tasted alright, but the service was extremely slow and it was EXTREMELY expensive. I definitely prefer Mister Falafel< /Review>

<Text>The best place for getting Lebanese in town im my opinion, i work right by here and Mediterranean food is my all time fav and have tried countless places in sd, nothing ever compares to the flavors here, it can be pricey but if you go for lunch you can get some big portions for cheaper, i would recommend to everyone i know< /Text>< username>

I was so upset when I moved to Montgomery to see they didn’t have one, but so excited when they finally opened one!  You’d be surprised how much cheaper it is to buy from this store than your local grocery store, and the quality of their goods is excellent.  Now that Amazon owns them and you have food delivered to your home, and order online, it’s even better.  I especially like their skincare and soaps.</review><Gmap_id>0x80e9152718d33311:0x66264a82c405f0ea</Gmap_id>< user_id>

If it wasn't for the expensive prices this place would get 5 stars. I spend a fortune here. But the quality is phenomenal. I always come away with food that is healthy and tastes good. Just don't come here if you're broke. You can buy three times as much at Vons or Trader Joes.< /text>

< review>
The best quality grocery store I have been to. Organic section is amazing. The compromise is that prices go to the roof. After whole foods were purchased by Amazon, you may be able to use your Amazon prime account for some discount. yellow and blue labels give you 10% and ~40% off. But you have to install the whole foods app on your cellphone.</review>

<Review>Store was pretty light on products which I understand due to our situation we are in now , but I know it's not based on customer service so I wont rate it any less than a four.  The cashiers can be a little more welcoming though;)<//Review><name>Polo Day</name><gmapID>0x80e9152718d33311:0x66264a82c405f0ea</gmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>It's probably the smallest Whole Foods I've ever been to, but it still offers the best grocery options in Santa Barbara. Maybe a little more expensive than a conventional supermarket, it's less excitement than the local high end/organic options. Some of their staff is also very good..<//review>< Pictures>

The workers are so helpful and friendly in this branch. I was scouting for some produce when one of their workers noticed me looking for something and took the initiative to ask what I needed. A lot of times I go to a store like Albertsons and people who work there tend to avoid my gaze in hopes that I won't ask them for help. So this was truly refreshing for me. The cashier worker was also very helpful by giving me tips on how to save money through my Amazon Prime. I don't really shop much at Whole foods cause I always deemed their prices to be expensive but this person gave me so many tips on how I can save a few extra bucks. The ambiance was also very pleasant and well organized.< /text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>State Street Whole Foods is great. You can still get hot food prepackaged and the taco salad fajitas bar is now manned by a friendly guy who will custom build your order for you. So all in all the experience is very little changed since covid. Have to admit sometimes it feels like the manager is AWOL  as the checkout can become pretty inefficient - lots of folks working but too few running the checkout (unlike for example Trader Joe's where they really step up when it gets busy).  All said, one of my favorite Whole Foods.</text>< pictures>

Great selection of items. Relatively pricey, but the quality of produce is worth the money. Since this store is small, the billing lines are very lengthy. I wish there was a delivery service.</Review>

Pre-covered 19 and post-covered 19 I have always hated how people don't know the meaning about getting space to someone who's in the same aisle. And at this location, people really do not understand the meaning of giving space I find it myself not even going into an aisle if I see more than one person and it happens a lot.

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Bad environmental policies; they forbid reusable containers for dry good purchases, and insist only using single use non-recyclable plastic bags. What’s the point of saving on packaging when they require single use plastic bags as the only alternative?

Anyway, they’ve not posted any signage, no doubt because the policy isn’t really one that goes over well in the city that prides itself on starting Earth Day. This led to an awkward exchange at the checkout counter where expectantly customer service failed, with staff claiming “federal law” and “upper management” are responsible and that no one complains (well, here’s one...) I got away with the reusable yogurt container with a mild tongue lashing, a few dirty looks, and a “delay to check the product code”.

The sad thing is, While Foods could use paper or compostable bags but isn’t making good decisions for the environment. Clearly, Amazon isn’t that concerned about that sort of impact, but I am and I’ll choose to shop elsewhere rather than support policies that discourage people trying to make a smaller contribution the planets unhealth.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8gpZcxxdhQjzpnVxO88YIhgLPh1kSq9ESioUt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6rsqlqCgFYmoUWlIDLwvDCESSyWdj0iK8QKFT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLQv_7la7foqEs8AOcaF2RMZA_T6HlA23WNc-u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Hardly a local business. Czar besos pays barely any tax and still it's mostly fluff here. They put their brand all around but it's basic ingredients. The staff seems to lack spirit and look depressed due to poor management and low morale. Amazon surely will buy out more locations so be prepared for the same boring salad bar across many more locations
, The only whole foods I seem to like are in Los Angeles and Berkeley, but our small town sb location seems to have been better suited as a circuit city. Hopefully they lower their prices because they certainly have lowered my bank account with not much substance< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Review>After Amazon purchase, customer service has gone downhill, inventory is not what it once was with specialty items, foods have been discontinued and now I can't even talk to anyone by phone - the WF greeting talks about no more delivery and then hangs up.  The past several purchases of organic seasonal unripe fruits have spoiled and gone moldy after 2 days.  I would like to get credit for such expensive items and cannot reach customer service.  WF is not what it used to be and has nothing to do with Covid< /Review>< Pics>

They don't have Lay's, but a good selection of micro brewery beers and that's what we were looking for. It would be cool if we could assemble our own 4-pack with different beers, so we can taste more of them.< /Review>

<date>1504398741273< /date><Review>Small Whole Foods that is dog friendly?  I don't understand why people think it's okay to bring dogs into grocery stores but that where we are as a society. The fact that Whole Foods employees encourage the behavior is a bit upsetting. I am dog lover, but recognize that some people are allergic and others are afraid of dogs (two reasons why we have laws limiting where you can bring your pet).  The employees of Whole Foods seems more interested in talking with the woman and petting her puppy while it rides around in a shopping cart where other put food.  This dog was a obvious puppy with no collar no leash no tags, who knows what kind of fleas and ticks might now be in the produce section????< /Review>< response>

<Review>Writing this after waiting in a line for over 15 mins ... not even “rush hour”. It’s one thing to pay premium price but to wait like this with some cashier stations still closed feels more like Smart & Final (where you get a deal) than a more premiere type market. Also, not enough vegan options given the plethora of animal-bases products.< /Review>< Time>

Some of the highlights: they have a great seafood & meat counter, a great cheese department, and awesome ready-to-eat food options for grabbing a quick lunch. Another fun thing: the bar inside the store! I've watched multiple sporting events here while enjoying a beer and appetizers -- so fun! The only downside is that there are always people out front trying to get you to sign things, usually Green Peace. :/< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Here is my guess, this is a 10-pound Whole Foods jambed into a 5-pound storefront. There are some good things here that you find in all Whole Foods, but there is no Serrano ham every time. Then, the aisles are minimally narrow. It would be better if they scaled down the size of the shopping carts. Still, my wife and I leave here and go to the newer Oxnard Whole Foods store to finish our shopping.< /Review>< rating>

<Text>High quality products but who can afford to shop here?  If you have a family you could easily spend $1000 a week in groceries. Trader Joe’s on the other hand is very reasonable for the common shopper who makes under a 150K a year.</Text>< pics>

I was actually really impressed. I came here for lunch, and although I always thought it was a really expensive store, I thought the food was great for how much I paid. They had a wide selection of different hot and cold food ready to eat, and everything tasted really good and fresh. They also had a nice seating area, with tables both inside and outside. I will definitely be back!< /Text>

This place typically has everything I’m looking for and at good prices. The staff seem completely disengaged, which makes for a mediocre experience. I try to engage with them to get them to focus on me - but it’s a 50/50 on if I can even get them to look at me. Most of the time they’re either having conversations amongst themselves or they’re staring down. I’ve never once been asked if I need help from staff.

The one thing I can’t stand about this place is how small and crowded it is. There’s barely any room for people to walk. They definitely need to either downsize on things or get a bigger space.</Text>

What manager at a grocery store doesn’t have access to a register? seemed like she had no care of helping me what so ever you can literally here that lady with her ear piercing laugh walking away as I waited 20 mins for someone else to help me... need better management training.</Review><userid>105365061503618924208</userid>< Response>

When the most memorable part of your shopping experience is a poster featuring an "African American" man with the headings "There are a lot of fish in the sea. We think some should stay there" followed by another poster featuring an "Caucasian girl" captioned "Up Strong. Harmless." There's definitely something wrong with the company as a whole.  The marketing department needs serious work whether they were aware of the implications/interpretation of the two posters or not. See my google photo uploaded to this Whole Foods for visuals.< /Review>

I can't tell you how happy I am with this store. The guys in the meat department are the best. They are friendly and helpful. The checkers are the best. I love them!

Now, when I need advice on a beverage, Gina is superb, and the people who serve gelato are as kind. I can tell that the people who work here love their assignments and go over and above.<//review>

The employees at this branch for some reason act like they are the most important people in the store.
I shop at this market almost every week day, and many of their employees I see every day and they never even acknowledge me!  They act like they have never even seen me before on a daily basis!  It is absolutely strange.
Aside from that, they will walk right over you in order to talk to each other, and will even do their best to cut you in line as they are purchasing their own food for themselves.  Can't believe Whole Foods allows such behavior of their employees.  I understand the price of their products, but they should take care of their customers who work their a$$ off to afford their products.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The Whole Foods chain is always a good choice if you don't want to eat at restaurant or in a fast food. They have many cooked plates, side dishes and salads. The price of course are not cheap. But worth a trip.<//Review>

I usually shop at Trader Joe's. Being a Prime member I was curious what changes. Surprise: nothing. Trader's fits me better and has exactly what I need in great quality for less.</Text>

I like WF generally. This rating is for 2 things: the coffee bar is REALLY SLOW. And the scone I bought from the baked goods was terrible: a tasteless blob of dough with a few cranberries. The coffee, ultimately, was quite good.</review>

This Whole Foods is small (I’m used the ones in the Bay Area and LA), but it has everything you’d expect.  There’s even a small bar inside.  I usually go to Whole Foods for the prepared foods.  This place is good in that regard, however the selection hardly ever changes.< /Review>

The staff are incredibly friendly and ready to help. Yes, there are premium prices for many items, but this is a premium grocery store. Nonetheless, there are deals to be found, you just have to be selective. In addition to its grocery fare, this Whole foods has a wide selection of beer, cheese, supplements, grains and organic items that are hard or impossible to find anywhere else.</review>

A lot of choices packed into a very small location. Clean, and well lit with cheerful staff.
As far as Whole Foods goes there are a lot of items not available here that one would find at most other locations, like bulk teas, bulk spices and the in house sausage options.<//review>

I don't shop here regularly because of the prices, but when I do, the quality is excellent. Only 2 exceptions: a very limited bakery selection and I haven't enjoyed the coffee or tea lattes I've had.< /review>

They play the marketing angle of being natural and friendly; but they are still Mr./Mrs. Corporate Dick. Natural shoes ( feet ) are a no go.
Trader Joe's, 3025 De La Vina St, is not too far away from this location (maps says 1mile), Go There instead, they have never bothered me about my natural feet.<//Review>< pictures>

The layout of this store is a disaster. Aisles are not wide enough and they have the entrance of the store crowded with produce. Tired of shopping cart log jams. Also, I doubt the parking spaces out front are to code. I have seen two people back into each other on more than one occasion.</text>

Poor customer service. My understanding was that Whole Foods had a "customer satisfaction" return policy (i.e. no questions asked). I basically got grilled in trying to get a refund for something I bought that was bad, and it was implied that I was, or maybe was, lying about the quality of the item.

The situation was slightly complicated in ways that I won't go into, but bottom line is that I purchased an item that was most definitely rancid, and they gave me a very hard time on a refund or even an exchange. Very unpleasant.

Also, this store has very small selection compared to most Whole Foods I have been too. Two stars is generous, and is more a reflection of the fact that the other "high end" grocery stores in Santa Barbara aren't much, if at all, better.< /Text>

The whole foods market is actually quite a nice place to shop and the layout is rather simple and not to elaborate. The staff is helpful but sometimes hard to find and the lines are always quite busy.<//review>

Disappointing on many levels, probably the worst whole foods I've ever been to.  Consistently poor selection in the buffet section that almost never changes, the pizza section barely rivals Domino's. Missing a lot of goods present at other locations. Special orders never arrive, nobody calls especially in the meat and cheese dept. Vibe of a run of the mill grocer with 2 to 4 times the price point. The chain as a whole has been on the decline, hard to grasp the need to work with local farmers and producers and set themselves apart. More worried about the organic stamp than conscientiously produced products, though there are some. I'm constantly there out of force of habit. But I owe it to myself to branch out.</review>

Today I discovered that the Salmon Chowder - does not have salmon in it.  The clerk was very helpful and called about my question after I read the ingredients.   The answer was that there is salmon in the fish broth that is used.

Secondly, the sandwich I ordered from the deli was over $8.00 - which I'm willing to pay for a great sandwich.  The bread tasted stale.

And the cole slaw I bought - I'm sure at a premium price - wasn't tasty at all.  We threw it away.

I'm wondering about other aspects of the business - is the organic raw almond butter - that is $17+ /lb - really organic - really raw?  I switched to Trader Joes for that months ago.

I also question whether the salmon served in the seafood deli that is bbqed and marinated - could it be a fish substitute.  When I recently served it, a guest asked if it were another fish.  Now I'm wondering about that.

I'm done with Whole Foods.  I've tried my best - despite the high prices - to appreciate freshness and organic food - what I associate with Whole Foods.  And, the staff are friendly, the store arranged in an interesting structure.  I'm very disappointed.< /text>

Today, I was in the Santa Barbara Whole Foods. Every Whole Foods I've regularly shopped is better: San Francisco, Monterey, Sausalito, etc. I asked a 'partner' in the tiny cosmetics/supplements department to double-check the micro-product number on a lip-liner to ensure I bought my favorite. I'd forgotten my glasses, and the colors of several represented micro-shade differences.

Her eyes blinked in stupefaction: "Me check? Are you lazy? Stupid? Recovering from a stroke? Do you not read English? Do I look like your slave girl?"

After her existential crisis had run its course, she begrudgingly checked the numbers and lined the two pencils side-by-side holding them up to me, like: "See 'El-Dumbo. Exactly the same."

I wanted the precise color as before as received countless compliments. I bought it with her assurance.

Made the long slog of a trek back and in front of a well-lit mirror applied the lip-liner. Hmm, looks different. Put my glasses on and the numbers/product weren't identical.

So now will need to walk all the way back tomorrow to exchange when this store regards returns as something akin to selling infants on the black market.

I realize there are actual problems in the world. I share some of them. But when you find your perfect shade and are willing to fork $18. over for it....is it really an unspeakable imposition to ask the department Whole Foods 'partner' absorbed in examining her cuticles to spend one focused minute to verify that you have the product you desire from the countless others that look identical until applied at home?

An added observation is that this store has the most disharmonious music/speakers of any Whole Foods, ever. When Whole Foods generally has toe-tapping, puts you in a stellar-mood songs playing. IF there is a Whole Foods in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana..I promise the music and speakers are better...because it is impossible to be worse than in SB.< /review>

I think it is really cheap and petty of whole foods to stop providing drinking water and cups to customers buying prepared food to eat at their tables.
I now go to other places that still provide water to customers</Review>

Worst Whole Foods market in the last seven states I've visited (NM, AZ, CA, CO, TX, OH, VA). Store has rude customers, rude workers. Too small to maneuver in aisles. Deals and food are great but atmosphere sucks. If you're local, try Lazy Acres(SB), New Frontiers (SLO and Solvang) or Lassens. If you're military, ask the commissary to carry some organic foods...they're pretty good in some food areas. For the rest- avoid this store.!!!</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>cosmetics service was nice and interesting at first and organic food options are nice such as freshly opened coconut  - I do miss exotic dishes from the cook in a turban  although recently they are gone in favor of  bean burritos ...

rest of the  staff is grumpy, and  not happy working there,
* irish seafood "guardian/server" is extremely neurotic and rude and
* latino guard looks like he is on probation for something ,,,   his dull and arrogant stare was not good for my digestion at the dining area -  can you hire more cordial and atmospheric guard ?
* Cleaning staff has no class and is upsetting customers with -- a chemical ritual and other nuisances...
* One fat service girl overcharged me for pork ribs, - $11.99 instead of $5:99 per pound  but I cough it in time -
^^^
AT  5 pm  loudest  customers get together at tables and more then half of them are yelling on cell phones in mexican language, can you post a SIGN  "no cell" ??
^^^
I used to go there 3 times a week when they first opened --- now i visit maybe 3 times a year just for a rare specialty food.
..
REALY folks! -  minus ratings on some visits to maybe +2 on best days for Whole Foods-- too low class for me and for many others< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Hello,

Yesterday I went to the wholefoods store in Santa Barbara. I put my phone, purse, and keys as I always do in my basket. I went shopping around, picking up a few items, including a BAC Foam Spray. A few minutes later I realize the foam spray is leaking all over the basket. It leaked into my iphone, which subsequently turned black and beeped constantly. I IMMEDIATELY went to costumer service, where a manager met with me. Danielle Iversen. She put my phone in a rice bag, and told me to contact the next day if I had any problems.

I called today. My phone is still broken. I was transferred to talk to Dave in management. Dave very rudely accused me of already having a broken phone, yes as Danielle saw my phone has a superficial crack on the back of it that had happened previously, no this did not result in it breaking the broken leaking bottle of BAC OUT did. He therefore told me it was my fault as I had a broken phone. Honestly, even if you do not want to claim any responsibility for the breaking of the phone from the liquid, for a man who does not know me to tell me about the state of my phone (he claimed there are chips in it and its missing pieces- which no its not he has not even seen it so to claim this to me rudely without any prior knowledge or info is absolutely terrible costumer service I come to wholefoods at least once a week with my family). I thought the way it was handled was super rude. I can understand that there might not be fault if you don't want to take responsibility for the broken BAC bottle, however to rudely throw it in my face when I was told to call back and discuss this yesterday, and tell me things about my phone which were not true was absolutely insulting. I would like to talk to someone about this as the situation was handled quite offensively, when I am the one now with a broken phone. Yesterday when this happened I was nothing but polite, and concerned. Danielle who was on staff thanked me for not freaking out and told me to contact them if there was any trouble. For me to call, and not only be insulted but also accused when I was told to call if I had a problem is just really out of line.

As someone who has loved wholefoods for years this costumer service has changed my mind on going back to this store if it has management who feels like its ok to talk to people in the manner that Dave did.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80e9152718d33311:0x66264a82c405f0ea<//gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) All Bio, you can shop with excellent products at normal prices or eat salads made by you or rely on ready-to-eat products. Fresh sushi, meat of all kinds, vegetables as if it rained. And if you are looking for food for your little one (ours is 10 months old) here you will find everything you need (mother's word!). This place saved our lives and wallets! Parking and free Wi-Fi.

(Original)
Tutto Bio, potete fare la spesa con prodotti ottimi a prezzi normali oppure mangiare insalate composte da voi o affidarvi ai prodotti già pronti da consumare. Sushi fresco, carne di ogni tipo, verdure come se piovesse. Se poi cercate cibo per il vostro piccolo ( il nostro ha 10 mesi ) qui trovate tutto quello che serve ( parola di mamma !). Questo posto ci ha salvato la vita ed il portafoglio! Parcheggio e Wi-Fi gratuito.<//review>
