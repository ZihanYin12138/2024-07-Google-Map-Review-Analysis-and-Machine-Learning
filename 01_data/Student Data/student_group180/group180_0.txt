<Review>Terrible !! Bad customer service! I have never felt more terrible for something I paid $30 for! Never!
It’s my second time here , the first time was OK (at least the salesperson really wanted to sell so he was nice).
This time I come here and they don’t even say hello. I am asking the guy questions and he is ignoring me before he even gave me the ticket to pay. At some point I asked him if he wanted to do the work or if they’re just uninterested.

I have an SUV (and I paid for one + tip!) and it took them about 15 min to “clean”. You can see in the pictures what my car looked like after. I told the guys it’s not clean and that I’m really disappointed and he seemed to be amused by it.
Forget the money, it wasn’t worth my time. I’m as unhappy about it as one can get ! Worst review I’ve ever written in my life.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcddd9c0a92489:0x162ded926d2dade9<//Gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0O2si_23l9Hw9cSbfDT6rbql-scPNACIAA3ka=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-ejTJbah3J1vofXYMQ7qtDYfsp2yZzWCGY-m6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPLvlgC3H2AcVKzqb4rdkKfSFxhj51_5mjO300=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Terrible service! It’s expensive and they don’t clean your car properly, you have to ask them to finish their job. Very bad attitude, and lazy people. Don’t waste your money and time here. I’ll never come back, I prefer to drive a little bit more to another carwash and be happy with their service. Please don’t come here!< /Text>

<text>I'll be sure to not waste my time and money here again. This place used to do a halfway decent job (it was subpar) Now it's just a waste.
If you're compelled to go here do yourself a favor and just throw 25 bucks in the trash and find a new car wash.  They even waste your time by not updating their hours. Don't bother driving down, they might not be open as advertised.
They will leave you scratching your head in disappointment.</text><user>108502949641980561493< /user><username>Mike Emch< /username></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Twice as much as the hand car wash that I use in Fullerton I have never had a job on my truck washed worse than today. I asked him specifically to remove all bugs from my windshield and front of my truck after getting them to wipe it down twice it was still apparent they did not complete the job. They also used a Terry towel which left fibers all over my windshield and other areas of the truck< /Text>< pics>

This was a couple years ago.  My car was pretty dirty going in, so I picked a higher tier wash.  It still had dirt on the roof and hood afterwards, so I mentioned it repeatedly to the towel guys.  They walked away without looking at me or acknowledging that I had even spoken, so presumably they don't speak any English. I went inside and they agreed to run it through again, which took an extra twenty minutes. It came out cleaner but not as clean as I expected.  Then the towel guys were uninterested in drying the car.  I found a  young man drying another car and intercepted him after he finished drying another vehicle.  He did an acceptable job and got a proper tip.  I've never been back, but it's always busy when I drive by on weekends.< /Review>

By far the best car wash I ever been to! My car has never been cleaned so well and the attention to detail was exceptional. First time customer today,  but they won me over and I will go out of my way to return in the future.  Excellent car wash and full service!!!</Text>

Nice job. They seem to care.

I've been going to this car wash now for 18 months. I've been in the car business for more than 25 years. The consistent quality of work is very impressive. I would highly recommend this place.</Review>

<text>Lost my wallet here.
No one even cared to help me find where it is. I am pretty sure I dropped it here. After calling them 4 times they agreed to look at the surveillance camera and they confirmed that I indeed dropped it there but I haven't got it back.
I read other reviews where other customer's belongings were stolen here so there's a high likelihood someone who works here still has it.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcddd9c0a92489:0x162ded926d2dade9< /Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< time>

Awful!  What a difference in service from 3 years ago.  I think the ownership has changed.  Here's where they go wrong:
- The rude man with an attitude who writes out your ticket.  No people skills, condescending tone who  looks at people through the lens of racist stereotypes.
- They have adopted a policy of leaving you dissatisfied so you are forced to upgrade your washes.  When you upgrade your wash, you are still dissatisfied, because they imply that you get a detail job.
- They don't do the basics: not use air to get particles out of crevices and corners?  Not wipe down seats?  Not wipe mirrors?
I would seriously reconsider spending $25 because it's an assumption that you won't later have to ask them to redo things or do them yourself.
Just wasted 40 minutes of my time to hear them tell me they don't do things most $7.99 washes do so you are compelled to tip the laborers better.< /Review>

Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!! This car wash is a total rip off! Please read everyone’s comments and look at their ratings before you decide to waste your money and time. Instead of wasting my time and money on this car wash I wish I had spent those resources telling people to not go here at all.
Seeing my car still dirty I told them and they completely ignored, they guy who was doing the inside of the car had no interest and when I showed him that my car was not even vaccummed properly, the response was “the vacuum guys must have forgotten it”.</Text>

<text>This place is not a real spa. It's just well located. No matter what they charge you (what type of wash you select),  your car comes out with the same level of cleanliness.
When you complain, they spend 20 seconds on the car again, pretending that they are doing a better job. When they see you're not satisfied, they act weirdly! They just leave and no one seems to be responsible.
This last time, one of them started saying some words out loud in Spanish, which is obvious what that they were!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dcddd9c0a92489:0x162ded926d2dade9<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
The Culver Auto Spa left my SUV sitting in the exit of the car wash tunnel, and as another car exited the car wash, it hit my vehicle several times, causing $1500 worth of damage to my vehicle.  The Culver Auto Spa refused to pay for the extent of the damage to the vehicle, offering me a settlement of less than 1/3 of that.  What's more, they told me this sort of thing happens all the time to them! I can't believe this place is still in business.  Don't go here if you value your car!

PS. I don't think they contacted the owner of the other vehicle, so if your black BMW sedan was at the Culver Auto Spa on Saturday Aug 15, please contact me and I can send you the photos and correspondences that I have.< /Review>

As I drove away from Culver Auto Spa, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of disappointment. I got the Basic Car Wash for $16.99. I didn't expect a a perfect job, but I did expect my car vacuumed (which it was not - all they did was take out the car mats and shake the dirt off of them). I also expected the windows to be free of dirt and bugs (they were not - I had several bugs still stuck on the windshield after they were finished). The rear windshield was not even touched (I'll have to clean that myself). They did a good wax on my car though. Overall, disappointed. I've received far superior washes for far less (Irvine Auto Wash did a fantastic job on my car - a detailed hand wash for $7). There's a reason that Culver Auto Spa has a measly 2 star rating - they aren't very good at whay they do: washing cars. They have a great location, and that's what gets them business. If you have the time though (or if you care about getting a good job done on your vehicle), avoid this place and go somewhere else.<//Review>

I would have given this place zero stars. I have never been to a place that is so disrespectful and unworthy of business.
First of all, the staff is beyond rude. When I told the guy who took my car that I just wanted a basic wash, he literally rolled his eyes at me. After I paid I decided to go across the street to get some starbucks because it looked like there were a lot of people waiting in front of me. When I got back, they were barely finishing drying my car so I asked the guy if they were done and he said yes so I asked if I could have my keys. He very angrily yelled at me "I need your reciept!". It was an honest mistake on my part, I never get my car done at places like this. So I pulled out mine and my boyfriends reciepts (he was getting his car done too) and before I could give him just mine he snatched both out of my hands and walked away. I called after him to tell him he took both but he just ignored me.
What happened next took this awful service to the next level. I went back to my apartment, which is a one minute drive away, expecting my boyfriend to be right behind me. He did not show up for 20 minutes. The workers parked cars all around him to block his car in and ignored him when he asked them if they could move one so he could get out. He then resorted to asking one of the car owners if he could move his car to get out and the guy literally told him to f*** off. So my boyfriend then found the manager and asked him to help out with the situation to which the manager simply replied "you shouldn't have made us wait for you" even though they were not even done with his car by the time we got back from across the street! And might I add that even if they did have to wait for us, they have separate parking spots for customers they are waiting on.
Basically, everyone working there is rude beyond belief (except for the cashier). And it is also true that the actual cleaning service they provide is extremely basic and not worthy of the cost. They don't even vacuum! You'd probably be happier just going to a gas station automatic car wash for the same cleaning service for less than half the price and you won't have to deal with being treated so poorly!< /Review>

TERRIBLE!!! This is my third time coming here and every time they have broke my front seat so it can't move back and forth (I know I should have learned). This time they tried telling me it was my fault even though I've never had a problem with my seat until I bring it here to get washed. Whatever u do DO NOT COME HERE!!! TERRIBLE!!!<//Review>

They didn't vacuum the back of the SUV; neither did they clean the rear windows. Missed a whole bunch of very dusty areas inside. Really, it seemed like the work of a ten-year-old in a hurry to get done and go play with friends. It was obvious they could care less about the quality of their work. They charged an extra $2.00 because my vehicle was an SUV; which of course isn't posted anywhere. And on top of it all, they have a grouchy tatoo'd thug overseeing the drop off area.

Ladies First is a must! The environment is welcoming to everyone regardless what stage your at in fitness.  Friendly staff that are eager to help at anytime. Instructors/trainers brings energy, knowledge, passion to every class! You’ll find that me time to have fun while working-out and meeting new friends along the way. Since joining the Biggest Loser Challenge and having that accountability, I found myself trying new classes. Ladies First has so much to offer!!</Review>

I've been a member for about 5-6 years and have loved it! I've checked out other gyms in the AV and I like that this place is ladies only. It may seem small to some, but it has everything you need (except for a pool- but there is a sauna 😀). The workers are incredibly friendly and fun. The classes and instructors are excellent. And they keep the spaces cleaned and well air conditioned. There's also a childcare space.< /review>

<text>I am currently in the biggest loser challenge mostly for the accountability. While on this challenge I've met some really amazing ladies and tried new classes with new and old trainers and I'm so glad I did. Some of the classes  I  wouldn't have ever tried, but during this challenge, you are encouraged to try new classes and let's just say I've found some new classes to add to my favorites. I have been a member for about 1.5 year and I love everything about this gym. The staff are friendly and they get to know the members personally, the facility is clean and it's just an all around happy environment! I have been to almost every gym in the Antelope Valley and I must say this is my favorite gym. I'm happy to call Ladies First my gym home!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>ladies first has been amazing! I was hesitant at first to go to a new gym but the second I walked in I felt like family. Every morning they say “good morning delaney!” and it makes you feel welcomed! The Boot Camp in the mornings are my favorite thing. I started in January and I already can tell that I am stronger and leaner. These trainers really want you to succeed and that is what I look for in a gym. I am so happy to have chosen ladies first as my one and only gym!< /review>< pictures>

We are in the 8th week of the biggest loser competition at Ladies First and all I have to say is I love this gym! I love the employees here, I truly enjoy everyone I get the opportunity to workout with whether it be in the amazing classes or lifting weights. It’s never too crowded although spin class fills up quick so I’m always on my mind body app setting up to go to class for the next week so I’m not missing it. During this competition we were able to be a part of the Boot Camp classes which was such a huge bonus! I always get welcomed by my name when I walk in the door which makes me feel like this is not just a business and I’m their customer, they make me feel like family! 💕

I choose Ladies First and I’ll continue choosing Ladies First! One thing I recommend is trying out all the classes...I tend to stay in my comfort zone but during this challenge the ladies at the front desk talked me into taking other classes besides spin, so boot camp and step & sculpt became my favorites as well! Love the instructors! This lifestyle makes me happy and it’s even better when you can go to a place you enjoy!<//Text>

All the ladies here are friendly and welcoming. The Biggest Loser challenge has been a great experience and am excited to see the outcome. All the women are encouraging and it’s nice to see familiar faces every time I go in.<//text>

I’m writing this review as a Biggest Loser competition requirement. However, my review is honest and non-bias.
I learned about Ladies First from a friend, who raved about their group exercise classes. I decided that I would jump on the bandwagon and start working out as a new year resolution. As I was signing up, the front desk girl mentioned they were starting a biggest loser challenge and if I was interested in joining. I’ve never been into working out, so I thought the challenge was a great way to stay accountable. I signed up and received access to all their classes, including specialty classes like bootcamp and boxing.
I seriously cannot say one bad thing about this gym. Every single trainer is mindful of it’s members. Trainers give you modified versions of exercise to accommodate abilities and injuries. All trainers have good energy, and are the kind of people I would want to hang out with outside the gym. Trainers are tough, but that’s what I’m paying for. I need them to push me past my own mental roadblocks. I’ve gone from never wanting to workout to waking up early everyday to get my workout in before my kids go to school.
I appreciate the gym being kept clean and aesthetically pleasing, and my children love the childcare.
I’m grateful for having found this gym, and plan to continue working out there.
Thank you Kim and all the staff at Ladies First for all that you do to give us a pleasant experience everyday of the week.<//text>

<text>I love ladies first. I’ve been a memeber since 2013. It’s an amazing place that makes me feel comfortable. The only downside is the small space they have for weights. They do allow for you to go into the “class” area however, when there are classes going you cannot. Which is almost all the time if you work an 8-5 job. Other than that, I love it!</text><gmap_id>0x80c2599f08695301:0x8aaae56fc93de888<//gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

Super clean and well maintained gym! Plenty of equipment and not very crowded with super friendly staff. I can usually only make it when I'm in town for the weekend so it'd be nice to have a few more class options but I imagine it isn't worth the small class sizes. Enjoyable to workout with only women!<//Review>

The boot camp is the ideal way to start the day - the instructors were creative and fun, the other clients were a hoot and we all walked out humming the tunes and feeling energised and proud of what we had achieved.  It changed each day and each day was amazing - love it!< /Review>

Nice place but certain areas could use just a minor amount of sprucing up.  Also, members leave bits of trash here and there.  Maybe more trash bins might help the problem.  Marketing tactics ensure business survival, but I dont like to get caught up in "caveat city" regarding various program and subscription particulars.  Watch what you sign up for because, chances, are in the end you will part with money inadvertently due to swift talking front-desk clerks.  Just saying.<//text>

I love this gym and recommend it to all my friends, especially those with children. You won't find a gym with better childcare than here, my boys love coming here and I get to exercise relaxed knowing how much fun they have. I've never loved working out before but it's now my favourite part of the day. Join!</Review>

<Text>I really love this gym. I joined back in 2013, got into great shape before my wedding. Amazing classes like spin, yoga and Pilates. Then I got pregnant and stopped coming for about 3 years. I tried to workout at home, I joined Planet Fitness - I hated anything I tried, nothing compared to Ladies First and the motivation and community I had when I went there. I rejoined Ladies First in April this year. I am there 5x a week (Monday-Spin or Glute Camp, Tuesday - Spin, Thursday - Cardio and Weights, Friday - Abs and Glutes, and Saturday - Spin).
I genuinely look forward to going to the gym these days! Some of the instructors I love is Kim (she teaches glute camp, she has great personality and awesome music - her classes fly by so fast), Jessica (she teaches spin, she is always so happy and seems to really enjoy teaching spin), and my favorite Audra (she teaches spin - she is a sweetheart, so kind, uplifting and she knows her stuff). I love the community that Ladies First offers, I have made friends and we motivate each other, we tell each other "looking good" or "I am so proud of you". I cant say enough good things about Ladies First. You feel like home!<//Text>< Pics>

Such a positive and motivational environment!! Zumba instructor Quian is phenomenal and will work you to your full potential. She is very passionate woman and cares dearly for her students well-being.  If you want to push yourself to the limits and ready to sweat, I would highly recommend to take her class.</review>

My mom has been going to this gym for 2 months now and she absolutely loves it!! She tells me the instructors are very proactive when it comes to their members. While in the  classes they encourage proper form and make working out so much fun. My mom has never had a gym membership until now and this was the absolute best fit for her. She really enjoys the abundance of classes offered and the daycare available for the grandkids. I have never seen her so dedicated and excited towards fitness. I am so hapy to see her making this lifestyle change and loving ladies first gym membership!!<//text>

I an taking their Boot Camp. It'is effective with noticeable  results.  The instructors I have are very good and happily my clothing is fitting very nicely now.  The best part, for me, was learning how to "eating cleaner".

That helped me continue to lose weight when I was unable to attend Boot Camp for almost six months. I recommend them and have to give them five stars. They work you and It works!< /Text>

Never ever is there stand-offish or snubbed feeling when walking into this gym, and that attitude is needed with all of the chaos around us daily!!!Y

I had 2 bad experiences with this facility. I wanted to really enjoy it but the spinning bikes are not in good working condition and the instructor would rather have a "guest" in her class then a paying client.
It's a shame, I wanted to go to a gym to work out and relieve stress but after the last time I had to email the owner with my many concerns, more than I just mentioned in this post.<//Text>

Ladies First one of my gym I go every Wednesday and Thursday taking only QUIAN classes which is
Circuit Training 8am to 9am Tuesday
Core Training 7pm to 8pm Wednesday
Zumba class 8pm to 9pm Wednesday   Zumbatoning class 8pm to 9pmThursday
Quian is the best instructor I ever known. She had this High Intense Class that everyone loves it. Shei will help you motivate and get that result that you want. Taking her class was the best thing I ever done that I sign up to all the gym she's at so I could take all classes from Mon to Saturday.
If you haven't taken Quian class, well it's never too late.< /Review>

<review>Called on the fly to do an alignment check after installing some better suspension and sway bars on my SUV. Was told to come by and they could take care of me. I was there 10 minutes later and the wait was only 10 minutes more. The alignment only took another 10-15 minutes. My steering wheel was straight and tight. Drive was much better. The girl at the desk was nice and speedy upon arrival. Maintenance guy was fast and efficient including some time to show me the issue. Total experience was only 45 minutes. I was impressed. Would definitely recommend.<//review>< pics>

I had a slow tire leak and called for an appointment but they were fully booked. They said that if I came in they would try and fit me in but I would have to wait a while. When I came in they immediately took my info and were super nice assuring me I would get squeezed in as soon as possible. I didn’t have to wait that long and the waiting area is very nice. Once the tire was fixed, the problem was a nail and the service man handed me the key and said there was no charge!!
I had bought a tire from them for a different car a year before, so I thought maybe it was a good will gesture, but even if it wasn’t I am a committed customer for life. Great place to do business!<//review>

I was a walk in for a oil change, So happy I picked you guys after reading the Yelp reviews, the staff is amazing and attentive, I did not know my tires where from your store, as you also gave me a free rotation and checked my breaks for me! As a female and most females are Leary of mechanics and getting charged for things that do not need to be done, you guys are sooo NOT in that category of people! I will for sure recommend you to all my female friends, I wasn’t sure if tipping was aloud? But would love to buy you all a pizza!! If can? Warm Alohas! And mahalo for showing much aloha on the mainland! Keep it up!!!🌺🤙🏽< /Review>< pics>

I came in here to get a flat tire fixed, but had not bought my tires here as my car was new and had come with the car. The staff was so nice and they fixed my flat super quick. When I checked out the said I didn’t need to worry about payment as they covered it! The service alone was outstanding but that just took it above and beyond! I’ve always heard good things about them but this is just proof that good customer service is still around! Good job guys!!</text>

Wow, I don’t even know where to begin. My family and I took a road trip to LA to go to Disneyland. On our way home up the 101, we had 2 tires explode! We were in the middle of nowhere and needed a tow. We were counting down the minutes to try to make it to this Schwab before they closed. We had to get a tow 115 miles to the store and they waited an hours after closing for us. I have NEVER been more impressed with any service I’ve ever received. These guys work so hard and with a smile on their face. If you ever need tires, know that these guys will help you in anytime of need and they supply some amazing tires. We are so thankful for them!!< /Text>

<username>Michael Parker<//username><date>1582051254343<//date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Les Schwab has been the only company I rely on when I have issues with my tires, wheel well, suspension, or any other facet, system, or device relating to the wheels on my car. Both times I have had to use them, the bill was about $1000 dollars. As a young, college aged kid, that kind of figure terrifies me when it comes to just about anything— but the thing that made that number more easily digestible for me was this teams incessant eagerness to work, and visible dedication to service. Everything from their ethic, to their demeanors, to their shop and all the way down to the small things like the way they smile or greet you in the parking lot; everything here is done for the customer. Both times I walked in with a car that was in no shape drivable or operable, both times I felt like absolute garbage and was in crisis mode, trying to figure out what my next step would be; I had no idea that next step would be figured out for me by the wonderful people at this wonderful company. They helped me manage my automotive crises, and have given me NO reasons to find anyone else to do that job. They do it far too well, and I do not intend to find another company, nor will I ever deem it necessary to do so— Les Schwab is the only automotive company I think I’ll ever find myself a recurring customer of. If you’re not in a great fiscal position to get things bought and paid for on the spot, they helped me set up a line of credit despite, as before mentioned, being a regular old college kid with just about as much money as he did brains. The level of pride they have for what they do manifests itself in the level of cleanliness in their shop and professionalism in their tone, and even the fact that these guys seem to know just about everything about cars adds to the entire environment they attempt to exude. To all the wonderful people down there at that little slice of heaven called Les Schwab Tire, thank you. You’ve made a customer for life, and in a weird sort of phenomenon, I almost look forward to parting with my money so long as it’s going into your hands.< /Review>< pics>

Moved to Hollister a out 2 years ago and still had my a count at Wheelworks.  But I was certainly surprised when I got my account with Les Schwab and took my truck in for new tires.  The staff were knowledgable, courteous, kind and just generally super easy to work with.  Their techs also take a lot of pride in their work a d wont ever return your vehicle to you without it being in better condition that you left it within in.  I'll never go anywhere else.

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>We walked into Les Schwab with a tire that was low, & a sensor light that wouldn't go off. We were greeted by 2 nice young guys right in the parking lot, ready to help. They took the car right into the bay. We went inside, greeted immediately by 2 more guys, again, so nice, ready to help. They figured out the sensor problem, told us to contact Toyota & that it was likely still under factory warranty, we never thought of that. They took care of the tire, which needed to be patched, & checked all of the other tires & said there's no charge! We were pleasantly surprised not just with them not charging us, but for being so nice, polite, & so eager to take care of what needed to be done. Great job Les Schwab Tire of Hollister, for hiring guys that really care about the customer!! Great, great, experience. You've earned our business in the future.</Review><gmap_id>0x8091f62b01ceed31:0x8c37bcdba029d86f</gmap_id><time>1564238198988<//time>< Rating>

<Review>Great service, great deals. You get free tire rotations, shock and brake inspections, and other stuff if you buy tires from them. I just drop it off, run to the store next door and by the time I get back it's usually done. The people there are eager to work. I came in on a "slow day" so they were much more willing to do work because they must have gotten bored. Can't recommend them enough. Oh, by the way, they have free popcorn from a machine to help you snack.</Review><Response>{'time': 1559261174535, 'text': 'Thank you for stopping by, Sergio!

<Text>This is the place for tires, brakes and suspension. If you have the option to try them out. I take all 3 of my family vehicles to them and I wouldnt trust anyone else. I live in Monterey and I commute to Hollister just for them when I need things fixed on my work trucks. Plus the warranty they give for the tires is pretty outstanding and their technicians are great and happy to work there. Also they are the most honest tire company with no rip offs.</Text>< Name>

Best place in town for tires and other wheel necessities. Judith is the best, she originally gave me a quote over the phone and when I called back to book she gave me a great discount. All the staff is friendly and very knowledgeable! I was nervous at first due to being jerked around by other tire places in the past. Judith assured me if I had any concerns or questions to come right back and they will take care of it. Most places are a lot of talk and don't back up there services... for now on this is my place for all my wheel needs.< /Text>

< Review>
What a great bunch of people! I never feel like they're trying to sell me, they just give me good advice and all options. I pulled in thinking I had a problem and in minutes they told me I had just lost a wheel weight and replaced it. I got great tires for a decent price when I bought tires. I came in with my trailer and a bad tire and they gave me a free tire that was better than patching my old one. And they didn't have to do that. Les Schwab is known all around the country but new to this area. People know if they have a problem they will be there to help at a more than reasonable price or free. I would say that's how they get all their loyal customers. You can always count on a bag of popcorn and a cup of coffee free in there waiting area. And I understand that their employees love them too.</Review>

Amazing customer service at Les Schwab Tire Center. Although, I have visited other tire shops, and they have great service, Les Schwab Tire Center truly has the customer in mind. I purchased four new tires and was incredibly impressed by how knowledgeable the sales representative, Judith was. I also appreciated the inclusives you receive when purchasing a set of tires from LST. The service was quick, professional, and friendly. I left with four brand new tires at an unbeatable price AND I got a great deal on a wheel alignment. Needless to say, driving away from the store reminded me of driving off the dealership lot for the first time because I felt like I was in a brand new car! The aroma of buttered popcorn and coffee first thing in the morning is a plus as well!<//Text>

It was just a overall great experience. I dealt with shane and he was a a-1 Human all together. His service was welcoming and left me with a drive (no pun intended) to go recommend Les Schwab to everybody I know with vehicles. So Thanks Shane. Thanks Les Schwab!!!

Always the best products... Tires, wheels, alignments, brakes, suspension. Whatever I've "needed" in the last 22 years in 6 states the knowledgeable staff has been stellar. I have never been over sold on service or product. I'm a Les Schwab Lifer.</review>

<Review>Not pleased. Took two brand new tires to be put on and balanced because the old ones were going bald. Cost over $80! and one tire continued to lose air after it was pit on. The rim was repaired previously, but worked perfectly fine before I brought it here.
Now the car was returned in state less than I took it, and they wouldn't even do a partial refund.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x8091f62b01ceed31:0x8c37bcdba029d86f</Gmap_id><resp>None</resp><user_name>Paul Carrillo<//user_name><user_id>115909842182242690520</user_id><time>1506304073364</time>< Rating>

Quick visit in today for a set of tires for the front of my vehicle. They even let me have my dog inside while I waited. Only took about 30 minutes from the time I walked in to when I left. This place holds up to the high standards I have for Led Schwab Tires Centers!<//text>

A+ service with a professional staff that goes beyond the call of duty to provide for their customers. I rolled up with a flat tire and a flat spare and was immediately taken care of by Leonard and Chad. Both gentleman made sure my experience at Les Schwab was positive. While I don’t live in the area, I will forever be grateful for the kindness of the staff. Thank you.</Text>

I already appreciated Les Schwab from past experiences but this was different. I brought my truck in for breaks and bearings and it did not go smoothly for them. They ran into problems and fixed everything without raising the original price. The customer service was second to none and I would highly recommend this store to everyone.< /text>

Our boat trailer lost a tire while transporting our boat, not only did they fix it, they let us leave our boat there while we waited for parts to get it fixed. The crew was so accommodating and helpful, we couldn't ask for more. I have always been a Les Schwann customer now my fiancé wants to be a lifetime customer.</review>

I called around on a Saturday right before the holiday and they were able to get me in for 2 pedicures and they did a good job. They stayed open late and kept making appointments even after ours. I'm impressed. (The picture is my pedicure a week old)<//Text>< pictures>

My nail technician was decent. However, I went with a friend and they treated her horribly. She would talk to them and they wouldn't respond to her. They rushed her service and they argued with her when she said she wasn't happy with her service. We paid for the same thing and what she got and what I got were completely different. We will be going somewhere else next time.</review>

Most of the time they take others they know and get them in and out. Usually they say they only have time to do nails or just toes. They put on the Acrylic I had on I went in for a fill and they said we don’t have that color?!? Then they put a different color over it and tells me oh this one chips by the cuticle fast I said why are you using it then? The girl said we don’t have the other color?!?? Really two weeks ago you did! . I told the girl she said oh you just came at a busy time!!! I’m disabled and I have to get rides so no one wants to wait for me for two hours!!<//text>< date>

Walked in to get shellac done, Kathy went ahead and did a manicure, something I never asked for, when getting ready to pay, she wanted me to pay her $25 got into an argument with kathy, manager wouldn't even step up, they always do whatever they want to do, they need listen to the customer and get off their phone, NEVER going back worst customer service ever.

<Review>My family had a nice lunch at the restaurant  Quan Bun. The food was delicious. I really like their spring rolls, the sauce was very tasty and the spring rolls are great. Everything was good but we had to wait for a long time. I hope next time the restaurant will be faster.< /Review><userid>113940313767611638900</userid><gmap_id>0x80dd296605620b15:0xda6012d755673c28<//gmap_id><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

Quick and easy spot to order food. Open at 10am and were quick to order and serve your dishes. Ordered the bum bo hue and came out to what I expected, mild spicy and robust in what I'd want in a hearty soup. The blood cubes absorbed the broth and it's a taste I would want to have every once in awhile when I'm in the area.</review>

I found a newly opened restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It Located inside a strip mall with many shops surrounding it. It was right in the Korea district and closed to little Saigon. It was small but visible from the street. I liked the decorations and its looks. It was almost full House when we came in. There were tables set outside if you preferred. Inside it was cleaned and organized. The staffs were friendly , welcoming and helpful. We tried their specialty Bun rieu and Bun moc , they were delicious and yummy. They were very interacted with customers one on one to make sure their customer's  satisfactions. The noise was medium and better yet as they told us this was a family run restaurant. They even told us the foods were prepared and made by the family. That was good to hear and was proud of that. The broth was right on the money and tasted so good. Would be back to try out more their other specialty next time we are in town.</Review>

<Review>Delicious Vietnamese cuisine. Different from a Pho restaurant. Friendly place. Not too big of a place, but got in quick and didn't have to wait. Would go again, specially during winter time for the savory broth.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>The food here is great. The portions are big and the customer service is great as well. The noodles are flavourful. The only negative thing is that they don't have much seats. There are plenty of parkings in front. $24 for 2 people.</text>< userid>

Found multiple hairs in my Pho.

The food was not that good either. Menu's lack description of food.

Edit: The owner responded asking me if I mistook them for someone else. Again, I thought I was ordering Pho but the menus lack description. The girl at the counter told me it was Pho. Maybe this is why I did not like the food.  (I do not know how to reply to the owner).< /review>

First time having Canh Bun after almost 5 years ! And I have to say it’s delicious! I don’t know why the restaurant is so empty when their food is so good. I came here for the Canh Bun only so I didn’t go through the menu very clearly but I absolutely come back for the canh bun (and other food, too)< /text>

<text>When I sat down at the table, the first thing I noticed was they had mam tom (shrimp paste) in a jar on the table. As soon as I saw that, I had high hopes for this place because I knew that this place was going to be authentic.

I had the canh bun and the broth was very fragrant. The meats in the soup were very tender. The fish cakes nice and light, yet had a soft chew to them. The blood cubes had a great flavor without any of the funk to them. Just clean irony taste, which is rare to find. The noodles complemented the broth very well; it was nice and chewy and held on to the broth well. One thing that usually is overlooked is the fresh ground chili paste. It was fresh and very spicy and went so well with the soup.

I highly recommend this place if you want to try some authentic vietnamese noodle soups that isn't the typical pho you see everyday.

I will be back to try more of their menu.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Gorgeous venue with great staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. It was an amazing location for a wedding and the ceremony room converted very nicely into the dance hall. Not too big or too small, very perfect space for dancing. The views by the lake are of course fantastic. Doesn’t get much better than this. Also great spots to take photos.<//Text>

<Text>Nice place to visit, quiet and relaxing. It’s a bit busy during the weekend however not so busy during the weekdays. If you don’t want too many people I recommend visiting it during the week. It’s beautiful and relaxing. You can walk past the building and go near the water/lake. (Lake Tahoe) I don’t know if the let people inside the building. Not really a place to spend all day as you can do many other things close by in the area</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzUG-bU6jBJo9tIKPSOxYNtQt_NsXEbeMhY6Bs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeCxMEgCDCRW7mhulnthB7rJ2tvGPckwlHGVPV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5-Ewb-FFV8hReL9y8OVpFUzeYqQQqu5wn-OaX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSirPpKuXJKYGwAWiZLyxguau7bQOQcw6V7Vvz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>As a photographer, it’s one of my favorite venues to capture weddings! As a bride who also got married here, it was exactly the historic lakefront experience we wanted for our out of town guests. The views and the peaceful surrounding makes for such a gorgeous backdrop from any angle. It’s truly such a special place!< /review>< user>

Stunning lake location & interesting local history with the mansions. A beautiful walk through the trees, paved with art  along the way during summer. Very nice for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing during the winter< /Review>

Had to find a place to service my Mini Cooper and found this one had good reviews on BOTH Yelp and Google.

From Day 1 Pete and his crew were very HELPFUL & HONEST.

They answered all my questions. I spoke to Paul and he told me what I could expect and gave me a cost estimate and timeframe. He worked with my work schedule.

The service went smoothly and they kept me up to date and answered questions via text. They let me know my tires were balding and was able to provide multiple (price tier - fancy vs. economy) fix options.

All work was completed in about 24 hours for my particular issues.

A few days later they checked in on me to see if everything was good. I let them know there was a service light that would not go off or was not reset (related). Pete himself came all the way down to my place and fixed it!!!

I like this place. They provided great service and work.

Price is fair/honest and competitive. Service makes it worth it.<//text>

<text>I trust Pete’s Autohaus over any shop or dealership I've ever been to (and trust me, I've been to many).

I wouldn’t hesitate for a second to send friends and family to Pete’s Autohaus. They’ve treated both me and my Mercedes with the highest levels of excellence in their service and workmanship. I’m not using hyperbole here - Pete’s Autohaus is beyond anything I’ve found before, dealerships included, and I honestly feel that they are a step above trustworthy. You want honesty, competency, and fairness, I wouldn’t recommend anywhere else, seriously! Not saying that to put other shops down, but saying it because these guys are that good.

I’ve been to a lot of auto mechanic shops and have seen a lot of good and bad along the way before I found Pete’s Autohaus. Before Pete, I used to be skeptical that I was being ripped off or they weren’t really fixing the issues that I would bring to their attention. That’s not been the case with Pete!! Seriously, they’re exceptionally skilled and, again, so trustworthy. Every time I see them, I sincerely feel like they treat me as they would personally hope to be treated, and I can’t imagine them treating anyone or any car any less. It’s truly as if they want you to have an outstanding experience, and wouldn’t settle for less. They’re passionate, kind, skilled, conscientious, detailed, and more than capable to resolve all the many things I throw at them. I was telling my girlfriend last night what a blessing it’s been to have found these guys and how I sincerely wish I would’ve found them sooner. Been going here for a decent amount of time now, and don’t have any desire to look elsewhere.

I found Pete’s Autohaus by searching online, so I’m posting this review as the least I could do to pay it forward. I actually found Pete's here on google reviews so hopefully someone else benefits from this review.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvBCnt3PXt8FMMZemb1kyguG7trstjTAFJZjDt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

I am being a little biased due to knowing the owner for over 30 years, but he is honest, professional and his staff is super thorough while servicing your car. Very detailed! Love the follow up and all that’s recommended on the service receipt of items that need to be checked in the future. Job well done from all. Thanks Pete!</text>

Pete and his staff are very good at what they do...service your car with a friendly and professional attitude. His whole staff wants to make sure you are satisfied with your car before you leave his shop. Pete will give you the best deal hands down and will go beyond the normal service repairs to your car. I recommend Pete's Autohaus over any dealer. Please give them a call if you need any type of service to your Mercedes Benz. You won't regret it.<//text>

This was a return visit after a recent water pump failure. Our car broke down and was towed the Pete’s Autohaus facility where it was quickly diagnosed with a failed fuel pump. We were informed of work and associated costs promptly. The repair was carried out same day.

As our last visit the staff were courteous and professional, again a great experience. Pete also followed up to see if the repair costs were covered under BMW under their recall program. Alas we were too late, but we appreciate the inquiry.

Overall, a very professional service.

Thank you Pete’s Autohaus.< /Review>

I was nearby from out of town and noticed my first night out second headlight went out. I’m in a recent BMW so the headlights are Xenon, take a little time (& money) to fix, so I let the one sit for couple weeks. Anyhow I called in, spoke with Pete and he was very helpful and also gave advice on an oil leak, topped off & I was on my way. Pete and his team were thorough & professional and helped me out while in a pinch.

Thank you Pete< /Text>

<Date>1590122176136<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>Pete was amazing! I had taken my 2014 Mercedes C250 that only has 51,700 miles to MB dealer for repair when engine light came on. I was quoted $5200 (not including tax), to repair. Long story short I took my car to Pete as he came highly recommended to me. Pete was knowledgeable, honest, thorough, and extremely gracious. The cost of repair was considerably less than MB, so much so I agreed to have some additional work done on car and total cost was still less than MB. I have had car back for over a week and it drives fantastic. I will be taking my car to Pete's from now on, which is a big deal because I live in Laguna ........totally worth it to have a mechanic you trust. Thank you Pete, I appreciate the work you did on my car and the beyond fair cost for quality repair more than I can say.< /text>< Pictures>

Pete at Pete’s Autohaus provides one of the best examples of customer care and professionalism. He went out of his way to explain how his shop manages auto service and then thoroughly checked on the dealer service history of my Mini Countryman and ensured that any repair under warranty was honored by South Bay Mini. He did all the legwork and coordination and all I had to do was pick up my repaired Mini. I was impressed by his attention to detail and overall care and want to thank him again. I highly recommend Pete’s Autohaus!</Text>

Pete has worked on my two MBs for years (an 2006 E300 wagon and a 1972 450SL).  He is the best.  I got his name from some very picky Benz enthusiasts.  I wouldn't take my Mercedes anywhere else.  He has a great team too.  You can't go wrong.<//review>

Pete and all his staff are always very polite, attends to all your needs.  I do not go to anyone else for my car service, it has been more than10 years. The dealer service repairs are 3x more for the same repairs.  I encourage everyone to take their car to Pete'S for their car repairs.  Pete will also make sure you get taken home if you have extended required car services.  We are like family and I love it.<//Review>

<username>Layton Draper<//username><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Pete, Linda, & everyone at Pete’s Autohaus were extremely friendly, professional, & expedient with the service. Pete fixed an exhaust bracket on my Sprinter for 1/3 of the price that the dealership quoted, and he fixed it in probably 1/8 of the time that the dealership would have. He fixed the bracket and got me back on the road in a couple hours, despite me dropping off the van 2 hours after I was supposed to (and the shop had 20+ cars being serviced/already serviced but it didn’t slow them down). If you have a European made vehicle, go to Pete’s!!! (They can probably do non-European made too, but not too sure).<//review></record>

Incredible service -- friendly personnel, realistic prices, will not attempt to push service that is not needed.  Pete stands behind all of his work.

<Review>Pete was recommended by a good friend who is a car guy, and he now takes care of my Mercedes; My wife had been to TWO authorized Mercedes dealers with two problems she was having with her 2008 S550, and NEITHER of them could diagnose the problems she was having.

Pete asked us to just relax in the waiting room and fixed both of the problems  in less than 30 minutes and he would not even let us pay him.

Not only does Pete have a spotless and organized shop, but there is a sense there that whatever the issues are that they can fix them, rather than taking your car to  the Mercedes Benz Dealer's Service Centers and having the service writers 'prepping' you for the shock to your wallet they are about to assess. I strongly recommend Pete's to anybody seeking high quality work at a reasonable cost. Absolutely stellar service.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dd4abb7a99df99:0x42fa4f7bc1e7de6f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1544211210269<//Time><Text>F YOU OWN A BMW AND SEARCHING FOR A "FOREVER MECHANIC" DO NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT PETE'S AUTOHAUS!

I was referred to Pete's by another mechanic (Japanese Auto Repair Center...they are awesome as well!) who could not provide additional diagnostics for my car. As a woman, I came in a little skeptical due to the very bad experience I've had in the past with dishonest mechanics. Upon arriving I was sweetly greeted by Madeline who has been working for Pete for 20 years. She has also been taken advantage of by previous dishonest mechanics and will attest to the quality Pete provides for all his clientele....and i believe her! I talked to Pete and he was very detail in asking me questions specific to my car issues. He did not flinch one bit when I told him I had a case open against a certain dealership with the Automotive Bureau and explained what I needed. He was honest from the beginning and explained exactly what service he was going to provide. He also communicated with my case manager at the Automotive Bureau to ensure correct services would be rendered. (my case manager at the Automotive Bureau said that Pete's Autohaus is on their list of certified and capable mechanics database...this is extremely important) At this point, I was feeling confident and reassured that Pete would take care of me. That is very rare in this industry, very rare!!! The work was PROPERLY done in one day and I am completely happy with the detail knowledge Pete has in this industry and most importantly the HONESTY!!! Like i said do not go anywhere else but Pete's.

Shout out to Madeline and her wonderful team :)

Pete's is amazing.  I really like their professionalism and their work is great.  You will find that you will get an honest quote for your repairs and they will not rip you off.  I have a BMW 650i that has been a problem and I took it to the dealer to get my car fixed and they wanted $$$$.  Pete was very honest in his pricing.  Love them.  I will use Pete for all of my car services.  My oil change and filter change was half the price I would have paid to the dealership.  Pete and Art are great to work with!!!<//text>

I am so happy I find you! My car is not getting any younger, and I was looking and praying for a good BMW mechanics.
I am so relieved knowing that my car is in good hands now. The service you provide is high quality, your staff is extremely nice and accommodating, and the turn around is super fast.
Thank you for taking good care of my car!</Review>

I've been a customer for over 30years.  The team at Pete's Autohaus are fast, efficient and very courteous.  Their ability to accurately diagnose problems have saved me thousands of dollars over the years.  Unlike many repair shops, including dealerships,  Pete will only replace those parts that are in a failed state, reducing the cost of repair.

Great service!

<Review>Pete is honest, reasonable and cares about the work he does for his customers.  He is the first really honest repair person that I have ever known.  I have been going to Pete for years and would never change.  If you want an excellent, honest and reasonable mechanic then Pete is your man.  I would recommend him to anyone looking for a Mercedes mechanic.  M. Casper, Long Beach, CA<//Review>< GmapID>

Pete and Art are very nice and prompt on job.
Besides , the price for service is always reasonable to compare with dealer's shop.
I recommend this place for many of my friends.

<Review>For many years Pete has handled the service on my 2001 Mercedes S-500. The service has always been excellent with fair pricing on the needed work. If you need an honest and capable shop for your automobile I can recommend Pete's Autohaus.

The only problem I have with Pete's Autohaus is that I have only one Mercedes. If I could take my other brand cars to Pete's I would. Excellent service, friendly people.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd4abb7a99df99:0x42fa4f7bc1e7de6f</Gmap_id>< user_name>

I have been a customer of Pete's Autohaus for 10 years.
I have had my 3 Mercedes serviced there.
My son is now a loyal customer and has his BMW serviced at Pete's.
We have had excellent and reliable service for 10 years and I am a loyal customer.  Friendly staff, honest, sincere and reliable with reasonable pricing.                            I would recommend Pete's Autohaus to anyone who wants excellent service work done on their European car by reliable, skilled and honest car service professionals.You can always rely on a detailed explanation about the work performed on your car. Our family couldn't be happier with how well we have been treated over the years.

Thank you Pete's Autohaus for taking care of our family's cars for all these years.

Sincerely,

As someone who knows nothing about cars, I always hate going to the mechanic. At Pete's,  I felt 100% confident that I was not being taken advantage of. From the time I called to schedule the appointment to the time I picked up my car I experienced nothing but kindness and professionalism. Art and Pete told me what was wrong, what needed to be fixed and what could wait. I will definately go back.< /review>

It's a good honest shop.  Won't sell you what you don't need, and doesn't just "throw parts" at a problem.  Pete's a good guy that wants to address the actual problem & understand what's really going on with the car.  This is my first BMW and it can get a little crazy on the $$, so I'm glad I found these guys to help take the sting out of the upkeep costs.<//text>

<Text>Was disgusted by service at Mercedes dealership and saw Pete’s ad saying that they could fix problems others couldn’t.  That is an understatement.  They not only located and fixed an annoying noise which the dearlership couldn’t but repaired a poor repair made at the dealership.  Pete’s is amazing and is now my go to shop for all my repair needs.  I’ve already been back for routine maintenance and they’re great. They do the job right and get you in and out quickly. And to top it all off everyone is so friendly and helpful.  Absolutely A+ service  I can’t recommend them highly enough!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>Excellent service.  Great rates.  Diagnosis prior to work is always very good.  Turn around time is very reasonable.  Pete has saved me thousands.  Another place in Culver City (AUTOTECH) completely misdiagnosed a problem with my Mercedes.  Even suggested selling it to Carmax.  2 years later after taking to Pete's and the car is performing great!</Review>< Resp>

Pete's Auto scrapped out more than of the items on the list to begin with, showed me what and where those parts are and why i do NOT need them serviced.  Then they took care of the 'battery failure' message in iDrive...computer module re-set was all i needed! dealer suggested a replacement, which was 5 times more (than a system re-set)!</text>< pictures>

Pete and his crew are the most knowledgable, friendly and honest authorized Mercedes service staff I have ever encountered. I've been coming here for years and will continue to do so. If you're taking your Benz for service to a dealership or another independent shop, make the change now. You'll be glad you did.<//text>

Pete's Autohaus  is the only one auto service house I have trusted for last 30 years. I feel safe of driving after his prompt and reliable service on all my Mercedes Benz. His excellent service is highly recommended to all.</review>

I discovered Pete's about 6  years ago and have taken our MBZ's there ever since. I trust them to be fair and honest. My old service  Autohaus
in long beach where I had taken our cars for over 25 years closed because of his age. No one wanted to take it over and I had been
searching for another for several years. I recommend Pete and all
their personnel. I have to give them 5 stars.

<Review>They blew the rings out of my V12 S600, then didn't want to take responsibility.... Finally their insurance paid me. I'll NEVER GO BACK!!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1453787339912, 'text': "Dear Reader,\n\nLawrence is not coming back to me because I refused to work on his car. He called me on Friday Jan. 22nd 2016 to ask me for a price on engine mounts for a SL 500 Mercedes Benz and when I told him that I refused to work on his car he got offended and now writes this review to try and lower my rating and hurt my business. The incident he speaks about took place in February 2012(approx. 4 years ago). He brought his S600 in because it was not starting and we replaced the starter for that reason, shortly after we got it started the car started to have white smoke from the tail pipe, now there is NO WAY we could have caused his smoking just by replacing a starter especially when we have been telling him that the engine was already burning oil previously(WE HAVE IT DOCUMENTED IN HIS FILE). He was very unreasonable, so I turned it over to my insurance and they paid him off more than the car is worth!!\n\nHe knew there was no way we could have caused his smoking issue but he wanted someone else to pay for his problem and didn't want to take responsibility for his own misfortune. He caused me to lose a lot of time & money with no regard for me, he only sought after his own gain at my expense. So yes I refused his business, why would I work with someone so selfish? Thanks for taking the time to read my side and please don't let this person's misleading characterization of me sway your opinion of myself or my staff, come in and see for yourself that myself and my staff will treat you with Honesty, Quality and Trustworthy Service.\n\nSincerely, Pete Balyan"}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Best blood draw ever! Absolutely flawless. I walked in 10 minutes early, verified my appointment, and was called within 5  minutes and the blood draw (expertly done, I felt nothing) was over and I was out in another five!
Also, everyone was extremely polite and helpful.< /Review></record>

This place was nothing short of great. I walked in, waited 5ish minutes, the man at the front desk was super helpful and I was in and out in no time. Questions had answers, and I would recommend other people give it a try.</Review>

< review>
I made an appointment online, drove to the location with plenty of parking, checked in. Within 5 minutes, someone came out to greet me, do the paperwork, draw my blood and was out in 10 minutes. The young lady who drew my blood was excellent (didn’t get her name). Service was great, don’t understand why the location has such a poor rating.<//review>

Got my blood drawn today. In and out within 10 minutes. Checked in with the tablet (just scanned my QR code). The guy was super friendly and even though he took 4 tubes of blood - it didn't hurt at all.  Plenty of parking too.<//Review>

The worst business ever, lazy people, horrible service! I had many bad experiences with them and just came here again only because it was convenient for my doctor, no changes! Still horrible! Front desk lady gets super offensive if you ask questions because she’s busy on her computer, isn’t her job to answer questions? There are much better lab places to go to,  Don’t go there if you don’t have to...!</Review>

<Review>Horrible. Maybe they are understaffed but it was horrible. I was told a 5 minute wait but it turned out to be 1.5 hours!  Then the technician was awful and I ended up with tremendous pain and a tennis ball sized hematoma at the draw site in my arm. I am a healthy man and always told previously at other places I have  easy to see and access veins so I don’t know what her problem was. This was on June 5, 2020.</Review>< GmapID>

This entire place smells like bad breath. It’s musty and old looking. It gives off a vibe of “dirty” and “old”. The staff were nice enough, but I didn’t feel comfortable getting my blood drawn here because of the smell and shabbiness of the place. It made me feel like they might not be sanitary.</Text>

I read lots of negative reviews here, but as my doctor referred me to them I still ended up going there. To my surprise, everything was excellent. I didn't have an appointment but still only had to wait 10-15 minutes. You could sign in on a pad and it was even telling you estimated waiting time, which was accurate. Every interaction I had there was very nice, they were very friendly and professional.< /Review>

DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING HERE!!
Very un-professional,
lots of salesmanship,
misleading,
brutal, and much more!
I asked for the butterfly-- he gave the impression, he was welcoming the request, but at the last minute he did NOT use.
He did a painful blood  draw, more than needed,
put a big and unstable bandage, bleeding even after the job!
Chris is a pathological liar!!
DO NOT EVER GO HERE!!
I am going to contact Quest for an explanation. They should be prepared for an Class Action Law-suit!< /review>

If I could, I would give this place a negative 10 star review.  The people that work here are rude to the customers and always make you feel like you are a burden for coming in.  They act like they are so superior to you, and are just overall rude.  They don't ever make you feel welcome, and if you ever have a question, they reply in a snappy tone with an attitude.  Every single time I have come here for a lab test, I have always had an issue.  They lost my sample once, and they accidentally spilled my sample twice, requiring me to come in again to put in another sample because of their mistake.  And, not to mention, the wait time is atrocious.  I almost had to wait for an hour just to give a sample in that would have only taken 2 minutes to do.  Even my doctor thinks that this place is a disaster.  Please fix these issues, as I am very disappointed in this place.  Their job is to help you get the samples in an efficient way, and not to make you feel angry every time after leaving the place.<//review>

<review>I came here to get blood work done for my girlfriend. As she politely asked about the wait time, because I had a surgery to get to she was passively and rudely retorted by a white male at the front desk, if she can read because it is posted behind him on a screen. It was very appalling and I was completely disgusted by the man's lack of empathy for someone working in a medical field. And after that a woman came out to the lobby wearing her gloves holding a sample and got water from the public drinking tank. This place needs a completely new staff it is. For being so close to my home in Los altos I feel like I went to a quest diagnostics in EPA.<//review><Date>1527621815761<//Date><Response>None<//Response></record>

Is there an option of giving negative stars I would have definitely opted that for this branch of Quest Diagnostics.
A young man whose name starts with C poked 4 times just to find out a vein of my six yr old to draw blood.
I dont know who hired this guy???
A real bad experience. I would definitely say  anyone  not to go to this branch for blood tests for sure.</Review>

<Review>I had terrible experience with this facility. I needed a STAT ( the same day test) and ensured it's a STAT order when checkin. The staff answered back coldly and said she knew it's a STAT. At the end, my doctor office had waited to the end of Sat and there's still no test result coming in. It totally messed up my treatment plan. How could a blood draw center treat patient's life and trust so lightly? I'll never go back to this center any more. If you need STAT test, this center is not a choice at all. This center seriously need a revamp!</Review><Date>1539612885054<//Date>< resp>

Walk in took more than 2 hours, their website and waiting time board says 30mins, they told me the time estimate board is “not okay”. You need to wait for a long time even if you have appointment.</review>

Good :- Had an appointment, they stuck to the time.
Bad :- Nurse was ruthless. As if as she is dealing with some machine. Took 3 small bottles of blood, did not even inform that they need 3 bottles. When I asked later - she was cold about it.  Had little interest in whether the patient is anxious or calm or worried< /Review>

Will never visit again. There was a lady with short hair who made me feel like i was an added burden on her and now that i am there, she has to provide me service 'unwillingly'. very very unfriendly. i was there for blood work of my almost 3 yr old girl, the older lady poked her in both arms but could not draw blood saying my girl moved a lot, even though two of us were holding her tight. Beware!! do not go there.< /Review>

<Review>My experience was the exact opposite of those who posted negative reviews. I have nothing to gain in simply telling the truth. Everyone I met at this lab was very friendly and professional, especially the front desk receptionist. From the descriptions on the previous posts, I suspect there may have been some staff changes since the negative reviews were written. If you don't have an appointment, your best bet is to get there when the lab opens. I did not have one, and I waited 15 minutes.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fb6cdb9367c03:0xdbbf27fc6be8564<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was waiting 15 min yesterday in the office (nobody was in front desk inside) at 3 p.m to pick up an  urine container for my 7-year-old. Today I come to drop off urine sample of my child at 9 a.m. I was waiting again 15 min. Staff surfed other patients and said me that I have to be in line until they finish to work with other parties (two people)  and asked me to sign one form after they finish to work with all patients who  came before me.. Not nice people are working here!</text>

I got my speakers installed here back in November and I’m sorry it took me a while to write this review but well now this review is even more legit bc I’m just as happy w the job now months later as I was when he finished. The sound is perfect and he worked w my van which had custom work so it wasn’t the easiest job and just overall amazing customer service on top of competency and professionalism and trustworthy. I’d definitely go back and recommend ppl to go here. Thank you again for all ur help!!!< /review>

Great service! Dropped in due to a faulty connection between my back up camera and the pioneer audio display. Both not purchased from this place. The guy knew exactly what to look for, found the issue and fixed it on the spot. Less than ten minutes and I was out of there with my camera working. He didn’t charge anything for his work.< /Review>

My secret go to business for window tinting in San Jose. The owner is honest and quick to help. I have taken 2 Volkswagen Jettas and a Tesla Model S. All three were done with a clean installation, no bubbles after it was set. They installed on curved windows including the rear window defroster with no issues. The Jetta 4 years later, still looking good, so they used high quality tint.

The Tesla, my baby, came out fantastic and really improved the interior temperature and protection from the sun.

Taking my Model 3 in for a tiny job as well. I expect the same 5 star job. I am confident that there will be no issues.

Note if you get a car tinted, be sure to follow the instructions about not rolling down the windows until the tint is set up properly.</review>

If you're not satisfied with the service he will go out of his way to fix the problem. Super cheap and quality work. Although the younger looking kid is a bit rough with tint but the skinny looking guy is an expert! If you want to get your windows tinted go to El Tri Window tinting.

This is the my 3rd car bringing to this shop, I have met with Hugo the manager which is very personal and excellent advice on to what i should get done to my car..

I brought my 2017 Honda Accord sport and  got my tint done and must I say it looks flawless and amazing ..

I couldn't be happier and the they even gave me e deal..

The guy that runs the shop Donaldo is hardworking and reliable..

If your looking FOR A GREAT PLACE TO GET YOUR CAR OR TRUCK , THIS IS THE PLACE👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾</review>

So, I’ve been meaning to re-tint my rear windshield, however that’s a project that’s been put on hold due to the cost. The tint was bubbling and peeling off and overall made it very difficult to look out when backing up. After carving out some time, I made a couple calls and settled on El Tri Car Stereo and Tint to do the job. Hugo quoted me at a much cheaper price than the average place and he did a beautiful job at removing and reapplying my tint so now looking through it is as clear as day. I’m a happy camper!<//text>

The owner here gave me a fair quote on the phone and then followed it up with a fair quote in person, was able to hook up a replacement stereo within 45 minutes (did it himself) and was patient enough to teach me how to use the bluetooth/usb in all features. I was thrilled!<//text>

Nice people, just be prepared to be up charged if you're a woman arriving solo. The price for an SUV tinting went from 250 to 280 once the "boss" learned I was a woman with a new suv. I will just use the groupon in Fremont for $165 and get the same service. Next try, guys.<//review>

<Review>Both Hugo and Donaldo are great to work with.  About 2 years ago, I had a Pioneer unit installed to replace my OEM deck along with a rear view camera.  Both are still working great!  A few weeks after installation, I heard a odd clunking sound when my window open and dropped into my tailgate.  At no cost, Hugo tightened up the rear-view camera wires which eliminated the noise.  Last week I though the Pioneer was acting up, but it was simply user error.  At no cost, Donaldo was very polite as he walked me through what I shouldn't do in the settings!

Oct 2019
I brought back my Sequoia for another upgrade.  A couple of years ago, Hugo set me up with a new deck and backup camera.  This time, he did a great job of hard-wiring my dash-cam and replacing my worn-out stock speakers.  Everything looks and sounds great!  Thanks, El Tri!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>Both Hugo and Donaldo are great to work with.  About 2 years ago, I had a Pioneer unit installed to replace my OEM deck along with a rear view camera.  Both are still working great!  A few weeks after installation, I heard a odd clunking sound when my window open and dropped into my tailgate.  At no cost, Hugo tightened up the rear-view camera wires which eliminated the noise.  Last week I though the Pioneer was acting up, but it was simply user error.  At no cost, Donaldo was very polite as he walked me through what I shouldn't do in the settings!

Oct 2019
I brought back my Sequoia for another upgrade.  A couple of years ago, Hugo set me up with a new deck and backup camera.  This time, he did a great job of hard-wiring my dash-cam and replacing my worn-out stock speakers.  Everything looks and sounds great!  Thanks, El Tri!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I ordered the "Three Amigos" bundle for variety. I was disappointed not to get the 20% off at checkout as stated when I entered my email address and was told it didn't apply to "bundle offers". ANYWAY...I am rating the PRODUCT here. I have to say that I AM IMPRESSED!! Those that complain about the small size obviously don't know what a STREET TACO is?! These not only taste fantastic and completely guilt free but they also hold up well and do not fall apart which is a MAJOR bonus. I will be re-ordering again and again until they are offered at an ALDI's near me!< /text>

I ordered my Tortillas and it was not bad as far as shipping goes.  but the Tortillas are terrible.  They are small and very grainy.  for my money the Mission Carb balance Tortillas are a much better tortilla< /text>

I took it to a Mexican food truck and they were so excited to make tacos for me using this tortilla. It’s a game changer and taste delicious with the right ingredients added to it.< /text>< Pics>

<text>I  am with the minority  who didn't like them.  They arrived pretty quickly (within a week).  They don't taste like regular tortilla which in all actuality they should not becuase They are made from oat bran. I really miss corn tortilla and i thought this would be a good subsitute. They are small,  but small is good, I eat less.
Although,  I guess I need to get use to them as I purchased the 8 pack. Anybody live in Chicago? I'll be happy to share.<//text>< Pics>

Waisted $50. On an order we never  received.  Just bad customer  service emails explaining how the tortillas will last 90 days.  I've  made 5 attempts to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Going to  cancel  payment  on credit card</text>

These are amazing!  I’ve ordered 3x already. You can’t just use them out of the fridge but you just warm them up on the stove for 2 minutes and their amazing. Shipping is expensive but you need to figure the weight and location. Also these are so good I’m sure one day purchasing them will be more convenient.<//review>

Customer Service is awful for over priced Tortilla.  I ordered a mulit pack and got something different.  Customer Service says sorry nothing they can do. How about make it right for someone who paid $40 fo Tortillas! Will not support poorly run companies.<//Review>

Utilized their website to order 3 packages of the 1 Carb totilla. Very easy navigation and purchase. Delivery was quick. Used my tortillas for the first time today for chicken al pastor tacos with homemade tomatillo salsa, cilantro, and queso fresco.

The tortillas warm up well on the comal. They taste great!

Will definitely be recommending Me Tortillas, 1 Carb Tortillas to friends and family.

It also great to support a local business right here in the greater Los Angeles area.< /review>

On the upside, customer service was great replying to my emails every time I reached out. They even said they’d send a replacement order (which never arrived) when I emailed to follow up on my order a few weeks later.

I understand shipping is taking forever right now, but unfortunately this one falls on the company. Everything else that I’ve ordered has been arriving, whether in a timely manner or not. Even a package that was sent to me from the Middle East AFTER I ordered these tortillas already arrived. No tracking information was provided other than a text telling me my order shipped on December 9th (about 2 weeks after originally placing my order).

I’ve been patient, I’ve been courteous and understanding, but I will not be ordering again. I lost about $40 trying to order from this company.< /Text><userid>106627223416040408585</userid></record>

Customer service and shipping is terrible. I will stick to larger grocery store chains to get items as such. Just thought I’d give this low carb option a try and it’s definitely not worth it.</text>

Very slow to ship  and used the cheapest method of delivery.  Very grainy and health food like for the tortillas.  Was hoping for a low carb replacement to flour or corn tortillas.  This was not the solution.  I prefer lettuce wraps.</Review>

<Review>These are not good at all. First they are extra small. Second they are very thin. So tried them with some beans and queso fresco and the flavor is weird. We air fried them to make chips and they were awful, kind of felt like I was biting foam. It's great that they are low carb but the flavor is just bad over all. Then there is the fact I paid 5 bucks for a pack and 8 dollars for shipping on two 24 packs, not worth it.  They also took a little over a week to receive.

They need to find a better delivery system or else people are gona give up on you. Soon the big corp are gona catch up to the ingredients and i hope they dont blow you out.
But yall need to know how e commerce works!!!! The giant always take it. Why not give free delivery charge a $1 more, an keep winning people  hearts, and your fans!!!< /text>< pictures>

Ordered 10 packs of tortillas with an estimated shipping of 3-7 days. Took them more than a week to ship out! Had to go out of town and of course thats when they were finally delivered and then stolen, almost 2 weeks after placing my order. This is NOT on UPS, they take forever to ship out your order. Thanks for nothing, no updates or anything for days. The gamble is not worth the hassle, money down the drain. Unless you can go to the store yourself I wouldn’t even bother.< /text>

<review>Best keto bang for the buck. The pico de gallo 1 carb tortillas are good; great for being keto. I use these for everything; mini quesadillas, egg and cheese tacos, and as a substitute for chipotle tortillas when I order in. I highly recommend that you at least try these.</review>< Pictures>

I hope the company improves customer service and soon. I placed an order and it took me a while to receive it. I had to email twice and then call to get an update. When I received my order they gave me the wrong wraps. I emailed to notify and no response. I don't think I should have to chase them down for answers. The products look good but customer service needs improvement. I think they may be under staff. I now feel like I wasted my money on this purchase.</Review>

I ordered tortillas from this company over a month ago, when it promised on the site that orders made would be shipped by August 25. I emailed regarding the shipment which hadn’t even been made and was promised they would be on the first shipment out (that was a week or so after the 25th). Immediately I got an email with shipping info, great right?! No.... the shipment has been in preshipping for weeks now. If this is due to wildfires fine that’s understandable but you should be the ones to let your customers know not me having to chase my order down for weeks or months at a time. Poor communication, poor customer service. I hope whenever they may arrive they’re at least good.<//Text>

HIGHLY disappointed in my experience with Mr. Tortilla!
I pre-ordered the 1g carb tortillas on 8/7 for an 8/15 shipping date. I bought one package @ $4.99 and paid $3.00 for shipping. I was informed order shipped 8/15 but no tracking information was provided. I reached out to Mr. Tortilla to request the tracking number but they informed me that they ship via USPS and are not provided tracking info, additionally the order can take 7-9 business days to arrive. On 8/28 I received a notice from USPS stating they would not deliver my Mr. Tortilla package because an additional $3.15 would need to be paid for delivery. I emailed Mr Tortilla again on 8/28 asking why my shipment is requiring the $3.15 charge through USPS when I already paid the $3 shipping charge at the time my order was placed through Mr Tortilla. I have never received a response back from Mr Tortilla and my order has never been delivered.
Mr Tortilla has been one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had! Save your money and don’t get bamboozled!<//review>

<Name>Melissa Marie< /Name><text>Really upset with the company. I placed an order for the Christmas box variety and when I checked out it changed it to multigrain. I reached out to the company by email and got a response pretty much within a few hours. They asked what I would like to change on my order (since it was just placed) and I thanked them for responding quickly and wrote back what I wanted. So I got my order... and it was not corrected. I wrote back 4 days ago and still have not heard from them. I don’t get what the point of their response was if they were not going to update it. Guess I will just have to find another low carb tortilla for my Keto diet.< /text><GmapID>0x80c291cfe50f9111:0xa757ea644d86f2d6<//GmapID>< time>

I bought the 1 carb pico de gallo tortillas online and am in love with them, I'll have to set up a subscription. They work great for street tacos, mini quesadillas, and they fry up wonderfully to make some killer nachos. Staying low carb is so much easier with access to good tortillas like this.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Great tasting 1 carb tortillas! Tried the multi grain and the pico both great, especially for keto! Street taco size. They fry up crispy in the pan also, going to try to make some chips from them. If you are local, save on shipping... Because of covid Mr. Tortilla is not open for walk ins and they directed me to purchase them from Magdaly's Tamales at 134 N Maclay Ave, San Fernando, CA 91340. Same price $4.99 for 24. Get some Magdaly's jalapeno salsa while your there, Spicy goodness!</Text>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Review>So I have not received my order (barely placed it last night) but I wanted to put in a review in Mr. Tortilla’s customer service. Five stars!!!! I got overly excited and ordered the wrong tortillas and when I called, they were not only professional but super kind. They understood that mistakes happen and were more than willing to make necessary adjustments to my order. I spoke to Alejandra on the phone and even though she was professional with the actions she took to make this newly keto girl happy, she spoke to me as if I were a friend, and not only as a customer. The matter was resolved quickly. I do recommend to call them vs emailing them, you’ll have a quicker response this way. Thanks Alejandra and Mr. Tortilla for your promptness in resolving my issue.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c291cfe50f9111:0xa757ea644d86f2d6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Then a week later they're sending me a link that my order has been shipped!! I thought USPS lost my package? Took a month to get some decent, not great, low carb tortillas!

<text>This business needs to evaluate their expectations.  Ordered from them in the beginning of July and still have not received my order.  I have corresponded with their customer service department and they say things like "you pre-ordered and orders ship August 15th." Lie.....still haven't got anything.  They also say "the post office messed up some orders." The bottom line is don't take money from potential customers and then not deliver the product.  If you cannot full fill the orders you get.....here's a novel idea.....don't take the order or return people's money!  I would not recommend this company due to inability to follow through with simple communication and expectations!<//text></record>

<Text>Ordered on Aug. 27th 2020. Ordered 4 packs to get the $9 flat shipping instead of $5 for each package below 3. Sent support an email on the 1st when I was supposed to get my package, they said it was a problem with Elite delivery systems ( I live 21 miles away so shipping is expensive for such a short distance), and that it would take 1 to 2 days to sort it out and be shipped out. It is now Sept. 11th (sent another email to support but this time no response) about what the heck is happening with my package (come on now I spent $28 on 4 packs of 1 carb tortillas) and still no update to the shipping. Terrible service. It's too bad, was looking forward to continue my business with them but no more.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I ordered two 1-carb packages - one multigrain and one pico del gallo.

I ordered directly from Mr Tortilla website and they were delivered 6 days later.

I have eaten both and they are very yummy.   I made shrimp tacos (sautéed shrimp, squash, red and orange peppers, jalapeños, onion, cumin, chili pepper, garlic, topped with cheese, cilantro and avocado).   Seriously good!

I will definitely be ordering more!<//review>

<review>I order 2 packs of 1carb pick and 1 carb multigrain. It took about a week to arrive the shipping is way over priced. I decided to make steak quesadillas with them. When I opened the pack, they smelled terrible. So I tasted it. Tasted just as the horrible smell. So I cooked up my quesadilla and for the most part my seasoning and cheese makes the cardboard bland taste. I would never recommend these to anyone. I would much rather buy the Aldi ones that are way bigger and flavorful.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I originally ordered the low carb large tortillas and to be honest they have a large amount of fiber, so be aware. Nice to have a low carb alternative. They held up well for a taco. I unintentionally ordered the smaller size about 3 inches across and those are great for breakfast tortillas at 1 carb per tortilla.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I ordered the 1 Carb tortilla from a Facebook ad and honestly am always a little nervous when I do that.  Mr. Tortilla texted when they shipped and I got them a couple days later in my mailbox.  Of course I tried them as soon as I got them and they are really good.  I would say they are street taco size and soft.  Keep in mind they were warm and soft because they were in my mailbox in Arizona.  Excited to have tacos this week.  My only regret is that I didn’t order enough.  You definitely have a new customer.  Thank you for yummy tortilla and good service! Start selling them somewhere in Arizona please!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c291cfe50f9111:0xa757ea644d86f2d6</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>This location has average customer service, but the labor charges are very high. You could probably find something cheaper AND with better customer service.

They'll get your car fixed for a higher than average price in a longer than average time.

I'd look at other options first.<//Text><userid>111482009846418218705</userid><time>1623102804438</time><response>{'time': 1623115150323, 'text': 'We’re sorry you had less than a 5-star experience.

Made a appointment for Ac service several days before hand, was told it would be no problem. The day I got here, I waited in line for 20 min, to be told they can't even look at the AC. They didn't even give a good reason why. Terrible customer service.</review>

Canceled my appointment 28 mins before I was due to arrive. I received an email notice. Thankfully I had my notifications turned on. Called to see why, they said they were busy. I asked why I received an email notification that said “Sorry you didn’t make your recent service appointment...” (I was on my way to the appointment that hadn’t occurred yet).

The gentleman on the phone tells me corporate must have canceled it. I let him know I was already on my way. He tells me it’ll be an hour wait if I still want to show up. I ask if it is common for them to send emails that say customers missed appointments that hadn’t happened yet. His response was “he doesn’t know.”

Incredibly poor customer service. Gas is expensive and I left work early to make this appointment (That I apparently miss in the future???).< /Text>

I had a 12 noon appointment I arrived 15 before my appointment. The individual who attended me said 1 hour to 1 hour and a half. So my wife and I went for 1 hour and a half stroll when we get to the pepboys individual says 2 more hours because apparently they didn't have the tires I purchased the day before. After an incredible ⁴ hour wait they still managed to keep all my tire air plugs. The incompetence is incredible here.its a pity how you have to give a business a star when clearly they don't deserve one at all.</review>

This place has very unprofessional service. I’ve tried to have patience and understanding as it’s the closest shop to me and SHOULD be convenient but often ends up being the opposite. First of all, when you make an appointment online, there is NO consideration for what you’re coming in for and no preparation. On three separate occasions I’ve made appointments online just to be told when I got there that they had no one in to do that service and that I need to come in a DIFFERENT day.

Furthermore in my most recent experience, they’ve kept my car for 2 WEEKS with no real time updates. I called every day for a week and all I got was “we’re still working on it. There’s rust.” But NO PROGRESS has been made day by day. There’s no transparency and no consideration of priority if a car has been in their shop for so long, there’s no urgency to get the job done.

Phone calls are only answered 1/3 of the time and each time I try to call I need to hang up an call again just to speak to someone. This place needs to clean its act up and get it together.</Review>

<Text>Excellent service just make an appointment and let them do their job. If your car needs more repairs they let you know.

That is when you want an excellent service.

I went there today to do my Lyft car inspection with a really nice guy called Jesus who was prompt to attend me and gave me all instructions about the procedures that I had to make in my phone before they took the car to make the inspection. When I was done with the information on my phone Jesus right the way contacted me and made the inspection as soon as possible, I got good time and felling there with the fast service provided.<//Text>

ZERO service & no customer service skills. I arrived & couldn't get a hold of anyone ... nobody acknowledged my presence for over 20minutes ... They ignored me & the fact that I had an appointment. When I was finally able to get a hold of someone they told me I'd have to wait 1.5 hours for an oil change regardless of my appointment and the fact that I had already been there for nearly 30mins ...<//Text>

I failed the smog check. I took my car to Pep Boys and they were the nicest people I have met!!!!!!!!  They took care of me like royality!!!!!!!  I had to have many many sensors replaced to pass my smog check. My car is over 12 years old so it was expected that parts do ware out.

I was told the results of the diagnostic tests, given a quote on the on the work needed to be done, how long it will take for the repairs and was given discounts that I was qualified for especially as a senior citizen and Federal worker.  I was kept posted on everything being done. I got my car back in a timely manner!!!!!!!

I can't say enough good about how pleased I was about the work done on my car and how I was treated!!!!   I would highly recommend this place!!!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</review>< Time>

PepBoys was great! Needed a Car Cover that wasn't in stock for my Ford Mustang.
Pep Boys ordered at 10:00am I picked it up 3 hours later. 30 days ago they did the same for my 1968 Firebird. That's why I've shopped at Pep Boys on a weekly basis since I came to CA in 1970.(pep boy's in ElMonte was my first experience) Wheels and Tires for my Corvette.They are honest,friendly, helpful and reasonable prices on top of the line products. I love Manny, Moe

There are times when pep boys will have parts nobody else carries and for less money than online.  Cons: (at least for me) the hollywood service department attempted to replace my timing chain and Destroyed my motor. Then couldn’t get it right after several attempts. I highly recommend the parts department though. And I’m sure tuneups and oil changes, brakes etc they do just fine.<//Review>

They worked on my car for the first 30 minutes. After that they didn't touch my car for a hour and a half. I complained and they continued to work on it. It was done in 30 minutes and I seen the mechanic drive off thinking he was test driving it. 30 minutes past and I went to go see where my car was and they didn't know. They couldn't find my keys so "maybe they're still test driving it". I walked around the parking lot and found it parked in a corner. I told them I found it parked and they couldn't give me a reason why it was sitting there. They searched for about 10 minutes and found my keys. I had a appointment at 8am to change my break fluid and didn't leave until 11:30am. Jose Garcia was the one who worked on my car.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>If I'm being honest, I've given this location several chances on customer service in the auto repair center. I'm confident in saying that their customer service is the absolute worst out of all the Los Angeles locations. They don't even say "Hello" which is literally the most basic thing. The gentlemen who run the desk seem as though they don't want to be bothered with customers and they will literally leave you just standing at the desk. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman or because I'm a woman who also happens to be Black. Who knows really...but I know that I will not be returning whatsoever. I'm not sure who manages that location but it needs improvement.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< UserId.>

<text>Redondo Beach location is the only trustworthy shop I’ve been to. The other locations I have been it have try to upsell me things that were totally unnecessary. So if I have to recommend a Pep Boys to anyone it will be 100% Redondo Beach Pep Boys. Thanks for the great service.<//text></record>

Expect to wait for a long time even if its for something basic like getting new tires. I had my appointment at 9am, checked in at 8:30am and was done just before 11am. They like to work on your car in 15min intervals because they take so many breaks. Customer service was OK.<//review>

Worst experience I had with them today. These agents have bad attitudes, doesn't communicate amongst each other, and fails to return calls. Called corporate to make a complaint had to wait almost five hours to get a call back to speak with someone to be hunged up on. SO NOT HAPPY WITH THIS LOCATION NOR THIS COMPANY!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
If this is the one in the city of Downey off of Lakewood near Florence Blvd. Stop!!!  Extremely inexperience personnel poor, and extremely horrible customer service. I wonder why corporate allows such bad service to the community and customer's.< /Review>

<Review>Pep Boys? More like Pep MEN 💪🏼 These gents always take care of me and my cars. There are thousands of mechanics to choose from in LA - but I wouldn’t even think to take my car elsewhere for easy oil change or anything related to my wheels/tires. John, the technician, is such a great guy - as is the rest of the team. Knowledgeable, great inventory, and no scams! I had a tire go flat and someone could have easily ripped me off and told me to replace the tire altogether- but instead they thoughtfully showed me the piece that had broken and replaced it for like, less than $10. Unreal. I recommend this spot to everyone. And if you’re bored waiting for the work to be done (Bc they do get busy! Duh! Great mechanics should be busy!) walk up Hoover to La Flor de Yucatán Bakery for the best damn pastries and tacos de cochinita pibil. Anyways - I’ve got major love for the Pep Boyz. Thanks guys!!</Review>< user_id>

<text>Good price for a battery... Big place, slow service for having one person available to assist numerous customers. How can you have one person working on that big place... Reminds why I should stick to AutoZone down the street... (small and quick service).

Ordered 4 tires online with confirmation that tires were in stock same day (09/10/19). Appointment made for 8:30am Wednesday, 9/11/19.

Arrival 8:25am on 09/11/19 and front end staff (Byron and mechanic w/ out name tag) inform me that the tires are not available and that they have no control of online orders. They have no way of checking the status of the tires and that maybe they should be arriving in the next shipment for 10am or 12pm, same day.

They question the validity of my order and ask if I received confirmation about my tires being in stock when online services state they’re in stock and ready for pick up same day.

After two separate search attempts, the cashier has found the tires in the back.

For a company that offers online pay, you should inform and train your employees so that this doesn’t happen to other customers.

The work performed was mediocre at best. They returned the vehicle with tire sealant residue all over each tire. Soon after receiving the vehicle, I was driving on the freeway noticing that the one of the tires seemed unbalanced. The vehicle was shaking quite a bit and that was not happening before. After pulling off and checking the pressure of all 4 tires I found that they were inflated to well over 55PSI when the spec on the vehicle is 44F/48R.

The specifications for the tire pressure are listed on the inside of the drivers door well and I’m sure they have the same information in their database. Simple things like this make me question the competence of the service employees as well as managements minimal training. Guaranteed I will not be back to this location or any other Pep Boys locations. ✌️</Review>

My low rating and discontent is with the counter attendants. Specifically the Caucasian older guy that will NEVER take walk ins, no matter how early you get there. He has the worst attitude and customer service I’ve ever experienced anywhere. I honestly can’t understand how He’s still employed with Pepboys. Anytime I’ve visited he has gotten into big arguments with other customers. The only reason why I still come here, is because I trust the mechanic I’ve been coming to for the last 10yrs. But if he keeps giving me poor customer service anytime I come in I’ll definitely take my business elsewhere. I’m paying a good amount of money for their services and all I ask for is at least fair customer service.< /Text>

<review>Terrible place, these people are scam artists. I asked them if they did a type of work and they said yes. I got it done and they seem to have a problem fixing it. Finally they said it was good and it seemed to be fixed but 15 minutes later the problem that was fixed was again not working. When i brought it back they tried to blame the new part was faulty i got from another store because they didn't have the part at there store. They are not reliable people working here and are trying to keep the place open by cutting corners and hiring people that don't know what there doing. I could go on but i'll leave at i'm out 80 bucks and my car is still not fixed.<//review><userid>109036788627269624039<//userid><resp>{'time': 1589795500415, 'text': 'We apologize that you had a poor experience.

<Review>Miguel, the manager that helped me, I have never encountered anyone so arrogant and unwilling to help or be polite to customers. Either a bad day or a very bad customer service. I stopped for a brake change. I did not have an appointment and still they took me in. So I'm appreciative for that. But the way I was spoken and treated by Miguel makes you wonder about bringing my business here again. Other pepboys I've had an amazing experience. But once again, this is not the way to deal with your customers.

I was told I needed a part ordered for my ac and I would have to leave my car the whole day since it wouldn’t arrive until the end of the day. I asked if we could place the order and have it done tomorrow morning and they said that was fine. Came back today and they told me I’d have to leave my car all day today to get the part put in. So what was the point of having me come back a second day to make me wait all day again?<//text>

After a miserable experience with the DTLA Toyota Dealership, I went to Pep Boys on West Washington on 1/18/20. They acted like they wanted my business, as busy as they were on a Saturday morning. Anthony Catizone explained everything in detail, called around and tried to find my tire. Unfortunately, I had to go back to Toyota to buy the tire but came right back to Pep Boys to have them put it on. Impressive customer service!! When these Toyota tires need replacement I’ll definitely go back to Anthony and his crew.</text>

They have most of what you need for your car.. Service is fast and decent.. 4 stars due to the poor parking arrangement and the lack of cleaningness.. Also do not forget to lock your car even if you go for 5 minutes.. The area can be pretty scary<//Text>

<Text>I was told I needed a part ordered for my ac and I would have to leave my car the whole day since it wouldn’t arrive until the end of the day. I asked if we could place the order and have it done tomorrow morning and they said that was fine. Came back today and they told me I’d have to leave my car all day today to get the part put in. So what was the point of having me come back a second day to make me wait all day again?<//Text>< name>

I made an appointment and then showed up and was told I had to wait an hour and half before my car would be done. I came back after an hour and a half and my car wasn't even in the shop yet. I had to wait three hours for a tire patch. On top of that they didn't even call me when my car was done. I had to go in and ask only to be told it had been done for 20 minutes.<//Text>

Booked an oil change through CarAdvise (Uber discount) I called,  went to the shop, and of course,  they couldn't find my reservation,  probably because they wanted me to pay full price.  Cancelled this reservation, reserved with Firestone in VanNuys. I called Firestone,  they made it super convenient for me,  they processed my request and I got my discount,  sorry Pep Boys, can't be giving my money away. Thank you Firestone!</review>

Can't say enough about the crew at Tilden. I found them via Google when I moved to Denver. They are incredibly service oriented, the shop is clean, and they're very thorough. In the process of purchasing a new vehicle, Matt was a great resource for recommendations and warnings about cars I was interested in. They're true partners in car care.< /Text>

<user_name>Jazmin Cortez< /user_name><Time>1579554206673< /Time><rate>1</rate><Text>I bought in my car because it over heated Pepboys stayed with it for about a week. Once I picked it up I started driving the gage keep moving and the car overheated I took the car back to Pepboys and they apparently fix the thermostat. Drove it off the lot and again the gage kept going up and down and the car kept overheating. The third time I was told that it was normal that the temperature gage would move between hot and cold. Finally decided to take the car into Nissan to have them look at the car Nissan was able to fix and replacement parts that Pepboys hadn't done correctly three times. Came to Pepboys on a Saturday afternoon and I spoke with a worker named John who I was explaining what was going on I was advised I needed to come in on Monday and speak with Eddy Diaz. John didn't even bother to take notes or a phone number when we told him that we wanted him to give his boss Eddy a heads up on a customer complaint he said just stop by on Monday. Came in today spoke with Anthony was probably the only person there who had any ethical customer service background he could not help me much as he was not in charge of that shop so the manager from shop number 2 came I spoke with him and I asked for Eddy. At this point nobody wanted me to speak to him, I spoke to Eddy who said customer complaints takes 2 or 3 days or even up to a week it's whenever he had time to get to them. I told him that I was not going to wait that long because when I paid for my service they didn't wait 2 or 3 days for me to pay I have to pay them right away. He literally just walked away after that and I told him that I would stay there until he gave me an answer he came back about 30 minutes later with an answer that they would only replace a for one part of the job that they did incorrectly again he walked away.  I'm never bringing in my car to this Pepboys again, my cars have been getting serviced here for more than 10 years I will no longer be bringing them.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I had my oil changed there and the oil was not the correct one. It caused my oil light to be on all the time and also the check engine light. I got the oil changed somewhere else, the oil light went off but the check engine light was still on. After diagnosis, I found out that the VVT solenoid went bad because of the wrong oil. I didn't have any problem before going to pep boys, now I have like 3 - 4 problems thanks to them!

I don't recommend them at all. They cost me a lot because of an inexperienced technician!< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Been coming here for at least 2 years for auto maintenance. There's always a long wait period (even if you book an appointment.) But, today seems beyond the normal level of hectic. 9am appointment for a basic oil change... almost 3 hours later, I'm still waiting, only to be told that I need new brakes despite just replacing brakes 2 months ago. Not sure if they hired new people or what (don't recognize most of the crew), but definitely makes me question my insanity if I keep coming back....🤷‍♂️

May just be a chaotic day or complete incompetence? Who knows....🤷‍♂️</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>My experience started when I went to Pep Boys in 1200 west Washington Blvd LA to get the battery in my car replaced. After the work was done, I started driving home and noticed a number of troubling things: my turn signals were not working, the windows would not roll up or down, and the automatic locks were no longer functional. When I called them, a man at the service center told me I could take the vehicle to any Pep Boys location and they could restart the system and fix the issues I was experiencing.

I took my car to the West Covina location and they told me they couldn’t perform the work because they didn’t have the proper system to restart my car's computer system. Additionally, the original location I went to put in an improper battery further screwing up my car and my experience.

I spoke with Will, John, and Anthony and none of them admitted a mistake was made.

I then went to a local body shop to have them diagnose the issue and they found the footwell module was broke due to Pep Boys putting in the wrong type of battery. The next day, my car wouldn't even start! I called AAA for help and they told me the battery was completely dead. I eventually had tow my car to the BMW dealership and they were able to fix the car after Pep Boys' incompetent mismanagement.

After the dealership fixed Pep Boys' mistakes, I called them and requested reimbursement for the fees I incurred due to their errors: car rental, Uber rides, etc. I gathered all the receipts and talked to assistant manager Antony. He never asked me anything about my claim. He just told me he will contact me after he submits my claim. It’s been three weeks and I've gotten no response whatsoever.

Bottom line: Pep Boys performed work on my car they were either too ill-equipped or too incompetent to perform. My entire experience with Pep Boys was a massive waste of time and I will never do business with them again!< /Text>< Response>

First visit parts manager had the cavalier attitude of I don’t give a **** and didn’t help me find any solutions to my problem, nothing but a shoulder shrug and tough luck. I understand you can’t solve every problem but you can control your attitude.

Second visit was equally displeasurable. NEVER order tires for these guys. They can’t even give you an idea on when the order will get it. Just sit around with your thumb up your *** until they call you and tell you the tires are ready. Those weren’t the words used but the demeanor of the employee left me feeling this way as I exited the store.

This was my first experience with the Pep Boys franchise. Now I know why I never conducted business with them before. Pathetic customer service!< /review>< Pics>

Anthony, the service manager, was very helpful on the phone and answered any questions that I had.
I have taken my vehicle to this shop for oil changes and a brake job prior to this instance and I've been very happy with the level of service and quality of work.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great  customer service! everyone was really helpful. Adrian Ozuna Service Manager #612 was very helpful! I purchased four tires for my car, little did I know the tires I had purchased were not the correct ones for my car. So Adrian took his time letting us know and explaining the pros and cons of purchasing those tires and gave us options to choose from. I appreciate Adrian's honesty, and patience with us. and through out our whole experience he found ways to accommodate us, both in purchasing our tires and how to make our purchase easier. Again great service will definitely step back into that place!<//review>< gmapID>

Don't get "Got" by the Pep Boys $19.99 oil change deal like i did. The untold "out the door price" is actually $30. Some people might say that's not alot for a oil change in L.A. and you would be right in certain parts of the city but that's not the point. Never again.<//Review>

2 hours for an oil change is absurd especially when you make an appointment.  Especially when you had an appointment yesterday that was cancelled because their online system has issues.  Tech clearly had trouble rotating tires, wasted a good 20 minutes finding managers to help.  Price is reasonable but better off spending extra few bucks to get out quicker if you have to do on a weekend.  Managers are nice and place is very clean.</Review>

<Review>Went in for a suspension inspection and told them when I turn i would hear a clicking from the front.  they said it was a wheel bearing and serpentine belt that needed to get fixed I also got 4 new tires. So when I got my car back it felt worst than when I turned it in.  Now there’s a clicking on both sides.  So when I took it back they told me it was the axles that needed to be replaced so I asked when they aligned it for the 4 tires y didn’t they say anything they told me cuz in order to Align a car u have touch the axles so either they didn’t inspect it or didn’t align it and honestly I feel like they didn’t do anything so now I’m taking it to another mechanic to make sure what was done and what they actually did cuz my car feels way worst than when I took it in. Instead of feeling better.  Miguel doesn’t know anything because when I asked him if my car needed new suspension he told me it’s usually for young ppl.  Guess back in his day they didn’t have cars with suspension only wagons.  John actually knew what he was talking about wen I took it bak.  If u take ur car here i suggest u take it when Miguel isn’t around because he will leave ur car worst than when u took it.< /Review>< pictures>

Big store. Had a lot of accessories. Went in looking for an alarm but they didn't have it. I did see other things I did want for my truck. Ex. They have a big selection of foot mats/floor protectors. They have a big parking lot. They also have a mechanic repair shop but I did not use it so I can't comment on that. There are people near by selling food so if your going to get your car repair you can have some food while you wait. There is an AutoZone across the street in case you don't find what you were looking for.<//Text>

Really Bad customer service this time around!!!They put water in my coolant and in my windshield wiper instead of letting me know so I can buy the fluids. It's a new car and Obviously if I took it in it's because I wanted to get it professionally done because I could of added water myself but it is a new car so it should have all the proper fluids. NOT WATER!!!!!! VERY UPSET!</text>

You know when a place says they're gonna check stock for you and give you a call back and they don't or take forever in doing so - well, this Pep Boys called me back in minutes with a response! I have run flat tires and the  previous pep boys did not have them in stock. So kudos. I came in to get the tire changed, the guy I worked with was very helpful. The wait time was as expected for servicing cars.< /review>

<Text>Convenient location to Downtown LA but they're usually swamped with work. Better to make an appointment. If you're waiting for your vehicle, make sure to stay on top of them. Last time I went, the guy who was working on my car left for lunch without letting anyone know so basically my car was sitting for about 10 minutes before I realized I needed to say something. Work was good, just a bit of poor communication.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Time>1472245026511< /Time>< user_id>

Slow service, while the given information regarding any future maintenance is adequate; the prices and coupons codes are not valid in their system. Get oil change done took over an hour.
Updated, after reviewing the invoices and the inspection points/ future maintenance recommendations. Cashier was friendly.< /Text>

Mr. Fernando the sales person was very nice.  My car was kept there for repairs and they supplied with a Lyft car. To my house from Pep Boys. When my car was ready, the same gesture to pick up my car. I would recommend Pep Boys on Washington Blvd. for your car repair needs.  Thank you 😊</Text>

I came to this Pep Boys about 3 weeks ago on July 6(?) for a wheel alignment. Once my car was put on the rack I was immediately called back to the shop to be told that alignment was unable to be completed because my Sway Bar Link was broken and I had a bulging tire. The estimate to repair the parts and do the alignment was over $900. After looking at the estimate they were trying to make me repair my front end suspension! So thinking that I had no other options I saved the money to get the repairs, but I felt like I should get a second opinion before I committed to the repairs. I took my car to Navajo Repair in Apple Valley, CA and I was only charged $25 to repair a small part that had come loose and another $65 for the alignment.

In short, I spent 1/10th of what this store was trying to charge me! My car works great and drives smooth again like when we first got it. I'm writing this as a warning to other customers and in the hopes that someone from corporate sees this and does something to change the culture of this store. I work in sales so I understand the need to upsell products to customers but this is absurd. People do not have thousands to spend on unnecessary auto repairs and we come to you because we are unable to do it ourselves. I just hope that someone else doesn't go through the same experience I did.<//review>

<Name>Tyler Saari< /Name><time>1532303152370< /time><rating>1< /rating><Text>Went onto their website in order to schedule an appointment to get my brakes worked on as it was an emergency. The time was 3:00, their only option for an appointment was 5:00pm that day. I scheduled an appointment, everything cleared, and I was all set to go in at 5:00pm. I clear the rest of my day and take off work in order to get this done, and 20 minutes before I get an email saying that I have canceled my appointment (when I didn't) and that I should reschedule. On the website it says the service center is open until 6:00pm, and I had the clear option to make an appointment at that time. If I wasn't going to be able to, then they should not be listing such services as available. As well, I did not even get a phone call or follow up email about why it was cancelled, just the notification that it was canceled. If I didn't set it up to receive email notifications about my appointment, I probably would not have even known that my clearly scheduled appointment was canceled by them. Now my vehicle is unusable and I have to take off another day of work in order to just get the repairs done. I should have read previous reviews about service, as this was not good service whatsoever.</Text>< Pictures>

The service techs and mechanics are good people.

If you need service, they'll let you know.

Most will not try to up-sell you. My advise, go to a second chain, or mechanic shop for a diagnosis, or second opinion, before you commit to going to this Pep Boys.

Prices are higher than average but the warranties are nice.</Text>

wow no wonder they have a bad rating. i usually go to the Huntington Park location but theres no open appointments today. They charge $15  per tire installation at H.P location , i called this location and ask them how much per tire installation,  the guy told me depending on tire smh tryna over charge and the guy just clicked on me when i told him that H.P charges 15 per tire.<//Review>

I had an appointment for my tire alignment at 10:00 am. This was my first time to get a service at pep boys. I have arrived here at 9:45 am to check in, they said I would take 1 hour. However, they even did not start to do it after an hour. I talked twice with the person to check its status he only said my car would be the next.... I was about to leave without a service after 2 hours, then they started to do my car. It took 2 hours and 45 mins to align my tire. They said it usually would take 1 hour. I got discount for $10 by the manager. I do not recommend to go to get a service at pep boys unless you have a lot of time be killed.😡😨 😢😢</review>

<review>I never made it past customer service. There was only one customer when I walked in along with one service representative. The representative is dealing with paperwork, so a second customer service representative comes in and squares away the one customer ahead of  me. A female customer comes in stands by the counter and I get skipped over. The space is small, I'm 6' 3",hard to miss, plus there'sno one else present. I was willing to overlook that until the customer service representative that was dealing with the paperwork(Mike) takes over helping the woman and the other rep(Will) leaves. So I left.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I went in with a spare on my car and flat in trunk with visible nail. Was told there appeared to be a possible ring of wear (from potentially driving on a flat) indicating possible internal damage). Was quoted 19.99 to repair and switch the tire out on the phone and same when I came in. After checking the tire, they said it looked fine and I wouldn't need a new tire (phew!). The service employee gave me a rewards card which took $10 off of my total, and I walked out spending $9.99. Appreciate their honesty and helpful demeanor, and would recommend. (Also go in the morning to avoid long wait time).< /Text>

Shame on the phone service. Im happy that they have separate departments for "easy"  and or correct help. But when calling tire depertment, no one answers. The time they pick up, i get placed on hold. Called again just to be transfer instantly and again no answer.

Will see if I buy tires from you guys or not.
In the end no price and or if tires available.</Text>

<pics>None< /pics><text>On March 13, 2019 I took my car to Pep Boys for new tires, I told the gentlemen that helped me I needed all four tires.  I was offered the wheel alignment, I told him that I’m a student at LATTC and that I was going to do the alignment in class. In the afternoon, I went to the office I paid and the keys to my car where given to me. On my way home while on the freeway my steering wheel was shaking, I got out the freeway. While driving on the street there was a wobbling noise. On my way to school I took the street I kept hearing the noise; I thought I had a flat tire, since my censor didn’t activate, I just drove careful. At school I approached my teacher and I explain what I had experience.  While taking the tires off he noticed the tires where not torque properly, he say “this could be the cause of the steering wheel shaking” he asked me if I had paid to get my wheels balanced, I said yes.  He pointed out the glue on weights to balance the tires, he said this are set a bit odd. I took pictures of the four wheels.  He then notice my rotors where wrapped and asked if I had any problems prior, I said no, I had gotten my brakes done December 2018. While in class he ended machining all four rotors and torqueing all wheels. I drove home feeling more at ease.
On March 14, 2019 at around 7:47am, I walked into Pep Boys I spoke with Miguel whom was the gentlemen at the counter, I explained to him what had happened to me the day before and what I was advice, I also showed him the pictures I took; Miguel did acknowledge the glue on weights where incorrect. He said at the moment the mechanics are not in, you can leave your car. I told him “I’m not leaving my car, I no longer trust your facility” I explain how as a woman with no experience, and if it wasn’t for the simple fact that I’m taking auto mechanics, I would have never known my wheels where not torque properly, or anything else regarding the service that I had paid for and was done incorrectly, which makes me think how long my tires would have lasted due to not being balance properly.  Miguel then made the comment “if your teacher knows so much, then maybe he should come here and teach us how to do our job, the way he wants it done” I said “ok” and walked out.
Not once did he apologize and I’m thinking, why would he, I’m sure according to Miguel he was not the one that worked on my car, it was not his mistake, however, when someone works customer service, one person’s mistake is everyone’s mistake.
I reported this incident to the BAR, one of the representatives contact the manager, asked for a reimbursement on the fee for the balancing on the wheels on my behalf. To his surprise they refuse to reimburse me $67, I was asked if I can take my car back, and for me to stay and watch the mechanic balance my tires. I replied “why?” I paid for a service, that now I have to take time off work, from my daily life to make sure one of the mechanics does balance my tires how they “think” I want them. I told the representative it’s not about the money, and I had already balance my own wheels at school. This is now about the fact I trusted them and the service was not the quality of the amount paid as expected. How many other people do these mechanics take advantage of, because that’s what it is taking advantage of those who don’t know and don’t have the means to examine the quality of service this location provides.<//text>< rating>

<text>Don't go there for auto repairs. I went there twice for oil changes  and they top off my brake fluid.  The amount of brake fluid is directly correlated with how much brake pad you have.  So if they top off the brake fluid, you could be riding on worn down brakes or even worst, your rotors. Buy from the store, but don't let them touch your vehicle.  Your life and someone else's could depend on it.< /text>< pics>

<Review>I used Pep Boys online appointment system to make my appointment to have rear shocks put in my Sentra. Early in the morning , I parked my car , filled out & left the keys in the envelope and dropped it in the early bird slot. This is a great convenience ! Around noon I got an E-mail that my car was done.
While I was picking up my car , Service writer Paula , asked me about the service I received and wanted to make sure I was satisfied . I told her that I was.
The shocks were put in fine and the service was great ! I will take my car back again. Let's see how they do with my front end struts installation next week.<//Review>< Response>

<Review>Zero professionalism. .. the guys seem like they are working in your car.. when they actually are not.... HOURS 3 to 4 hours waiting till you say something and they tell you one more hour because of what ever reason and they don't even know where the keys are .. not even a simple sorry for the wait.....guys are all over the place except working in the cars because I wasn't the only one complaining... 1st time months ago bad experience..and now 2nd time HORRIBLE experience... So I will not be coming back here to pay for a horrible service.<//Review>< Pics>

I went here because a professor recommended that Pep boys were good. Wow, was I disappointed. First, nobody cares about you. I had to call out people to get served. One guy just stared at me. After waiting for about ten minutes, a guy came and said he will change my batteries. He did not give me a receipt or anything. Then he told me that the memory cable was broken and that they could not change battery but after a while they said they said given that my manual was there they can change it without locking the stereo. Even paying took like ten minutes because the person could not operate the kiosk well. All the workers looked quite stressed and unmotivated. It was a sad day for everyone. Also, this pace is supercrowded so I would go to another Pep boys or mechanic.< /Review>

The service from the get go was horrendous. From the minute I walked in, the vibe of nearly every employee was that of 100% being mentally somewhere else and zero invested into trying to genuinely help. Attitude and funny looks if you have a genuine question. After dealing with that and then trying to wait through their procrastination for a simple battery installation, I asked them to cancel service and got the hell out of there. Not worth it.

Stay away from this place.< /Review>

The Mechanics Shuffle your things and steal cash in plain sight. The cashier/ estimate personnel are very professoinal. Mechanics needs manners in leaving the car the way they found it clean had to wipe away grease prints from the hood and doors.< /Review>

The service from the get go was horrendous. From the minute I walked in, the vibe of nearly every employee was that of 100% being mentally somewhere else and zero invested into trying to genuinely help. Attitude and funny looks if you have a genuine question. After dealing with that and then trying to wait through their procrastination for a simple battery installation, I asked them to cancel service and got the hell out of there. Not worth it.

Stay away from this place.<//Review>

I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PEP BOYS TO ANYONE!!!!  In my opinion, this has to be the worst PEP BOYS ever. Traveling to many states while in the military this is the WORST Pep Boys ever. I have been using Pep Boys for years and have always received honesty and excellent customer service. My son moved from Orlando, FL  to California to continue his education. Before driving his car across country, we had brand new tires and other maintenance done on his car. We spent close to a $1000 just on the tires which are not even 7 months old. My son heard a loud noise coming from the back rear tire. So I told him to take the car to a Pep Boys in L.A. thinking that we would receive the same honest outcome. First of all, he was told that the tires are worn out unevenly, and that's where the noise was coming from. They gave him a price of over $400 for two back tires. Remember we had just purchased tires which I have the receipt. So I told my son while he was on the phone, to tell him that the tires are under warranty. The gentleman is going to tell him that the warranty doesn't go from state to state. Now I know that was a lie, cause I've always used Pep Boys. So I hung up the phone with my son to call the Pep Boys here in Orlando, just to find out that the warranty is nationwide. All this store in L.A. had to do was to get the store number and the invoice number which I got with one call. The information was under my son's telephone number. Would it have hurt them to go out their way to make a phone call? Oh, I forget the price was better without the warranty. So once they found out that there was a warranty, the price drops down to about $285.00. It doesn't stop there. Now they tell him that he has to purchase a lock for the wheel. As long as we have been using Pep Boys, we have never had to purchase a lock. Question? Why didn't they mention this when they gave us the first estimate? It doesn't stop there. The reason for him bringing the car is because of the loud noise on the rear tire. Well, the noise is still there. Unbelievable. So I called the store to speak to the manager by the name of Tony. I am explaining to him what took place, which is clear English. He continues to say what can he do for me. This place of business? I don't trust this company. In my opinion, they ripped us off and didn't even correct the problem. I asked for the next person in charge of him since he couldn't understand the issues. He says there is no one above him and that I would have to call 1-800 Pep Boys. I said once again, so there is no one above you, and he said no. I said, have you ever pulled up my son work order since I've been speaking. He says no because I didn't give him a chance. I shouldn't have had to give him a chance; he should have asked for the customer name. So I called my Pep Boys here in Orlando, just to find out that there is someone over him. I called 1-800-Pep Boys, and there is someone by the name of Victor over him. Once again it shows the integrity of this business. They should have found out that the tires were practically new before they came up with the bogus outcome. So now I am paying the Chevrolet Dealer to take care of the problem since this Pep Boys cannot take care of a 2013 Chevrolet Camaro.   The opinion that I can give is to stay clear of this business. I am now waiting to hear from the area manager. I will also be filing a BBB complaint.< /Text>

Please beware of this pep boys. I have been to other pep boys. They mark up the work and don't pre approve work. I had work done the staff totally lied and marked up the cost of parts by 300% and to make it work they didn't fix all the issues my bill went from $139 to $1200  and my car still is not driveable. It seems like they are stack their pockets even at a store like pep boys with peoples hard earned money not cool. What mechanic would. Fix only one problem on a car. Beware All. use any other pep boys. I have nothing to gain by posting a bad review I'm just an average guy and no one deserves to be treated like that.< /Text>

<Review>I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I made an appointment for an oil change and my appointment time was not honored. I sat there for a half hour before the guy at the counter even called me up to discuss the situation with me and was extremely rude. Why would you be rude to a paying customer? After dealing with his attitude I walked out and got on yelp and found a place down the street who got me in and out in a half hour with a smile! Imagine that. Just a little advice: maybe consider hiring people who actually like working with people and don't make appointments with people if you aren't going to honor them accordingly.< /Review></record>

<review>even with an appointment, you may have to wait.......at least this location is consistent..I came by to change a light bulb and while standing next to a closing mgr, I was totally ignored.....so you can't be seen with an appointment and you can't be seen if your standing right in front of them. Now this place closes at 6pm probably because their losing business.......or maybe their not looking for any.....Manny Moe and Jack, you should be pissed at this poor performamce! I think I'm going to tear up my Pep Boys card......</review></record></dataset><record>

They charge more than the dealer for simple oil change. They wanted $35 to change my signal light period after I bought the light bulbs. Don't go there you're getting ripped off.</text>

They are extremely expensive. Just needed back rotors and lower control arms fixes. They gave me an estimated cost of 1400 lol. Bought the parts from auto zone for a 1/4 of that price including brake pads. And had a local mechanic do the fix that only took an hour and a half for 150. Saved myself 900. And still in disbelief they tried to charge me so much. Smh</Review>

I don't recommend this place because their mechanics are not specialized and their customer service bad. I brought my 2003 Toyota Sienna in  on February 19th to get the charcoal canister, brakes, shocks, and tires replaced. I took them 3 days to get the job done, which I thought was pretty fast. However, on March 4th, I had to bring it back because the tires were not well aligned, and since I paid a one-year warranty on the service, I did not think it twice. A few days after I got it back the engine light turned on, so I my car back again. They had my car sitting there for almost 6 days, and it was not until I showed up at the shop to see what was going on until they told me that they had not worked on my car because they needed the tank to be full. I got a call the next day to go and get my car. The next day, the light of doom turned on again, so went back to Pep Boys last Tuesday.  I tried to speak to the manager many times, but he either not there or busy at the moment. I just got my car back and the light is off; I just hope the problem is solved. I am not satisfied with the mechanics' work for all the hassle I went through to get my car fixed.</Text>

The store itself isnt a problem. The auto parts service is the worst. Ppl just ignore you. They have attitudes. Making appointments here is just a waste of time. Why have hourly appointments available if you dont have the staff and then when you get there you have to wait additional time, up to hours. For them to even begin to help you< /Text>

<text>Friendly staff in general, exception of 1older man who appears to be a service dept manager kept on ignoring me while waiting ready to ask a consultation on batteries.

< Review>
Do NOT go there. Waited 4 hours (not an exaggeration) for them to check the tires and tell me that the tire are "probably" a little overinflated. I was told at first that the wait was going to be  an hour and a half and then after I came back two hours later they said my car was "the next one" and it would only be another 20 minutes. The workers were all hanging out and laughing when I finally went to tell them I wanted my keys back another hour later. At that point one of them tells me "we're doing it now, someone just went around and inflated your tires, but we're going to check it now". It takes them 2 minutes to do so, and he finally says my dashboard light was on because my tires are overinflated. Careless, rude, lazy. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.< /Review>

Been at location 5 Times over last 3 weeks and every time they're out of order of air filter for 2011 honda odyssey. Supposedly this location is largest location of all pep boys franchise.  Same excuses per each trip new shipments on next Monday.  I rather visit their competitors instead coming back here. By the way on my last visit I was told either pick it up from Hollywood location or they will hold a stock once request transfer from sister location, cannot trust incompetent representative again. I rather pick it up from AutoZone instead of waste yet another trip to to this location. I'll keep the names of representatives anonymous, Don't want them to get get in trouble with management, however wish they could learn from these incidents.</review>

I brought my car to this pep boys for an oil change and they told me it was going to be ready in less then 2 hours it they took a lil over 3 hours! and ol boy they dont have good service skills it seems they are force to deal with you they dont care about you as a customer. I went up twice to ask how much longer and these guys didnt even bother the come up to the counter and talk to me they were all doin something and talking to me from far away. Really disappointing! Please people sint come to this location you will regret it.</review>

<review>Lets try to keep this short. I asked for a $34.99 fluid service that took specific fluid that I had already picked up from the dealer. First 2 questions they asked me is "what kind of vehicle is it" and "whats the issue with the vehicle." Again I came in asking for a scheduled maintenance service they provide. Nothing more.

My vehicle did have a specific problem that I was trying to eliminate or narrow down the culprit of the problem. However their opinion was that this service would not fix it. Their version of how this goes is to diagnose the problem (which they believe is a $1000+ parts and labor) and go from there but since it had to do with drivetrain, they would deny the service anyways, and tried to send me to Aamco. Which was closed for the next 3 days. Fun fact, I live out of state and dont have time to NOT do this. The problem occured when I was out in LA. Not like I could just go home or call a friend to figure this out. Another fun fact, the proper way to diagnose my vehicles symptom is to drain the fluid and examine it. If fluid is normal wear, then top it off. So why are we wasting my time? Just do the flush.

I have a "luxury" vehicle however its a rebadge glorified common Chevy. Kind of like a Tahoe is the same as an Escalade. I made it very clear its nothing sophisticated. The service advisors rufuse to accept that. One tech actually told their service advisor they cant do it because "this" make and "that" make vehicles take special tools. At that point I yelled its a Chevy. I even told them the tool required to do the service. Its small enough to put on your keychain!

After wasting my time there for an hour repeating to at least 6 people what I wanted and each one following up with those same 2 questions, I finally got them to just want to get rid of me so they asked a tech take a look. To cut it short, they wrote up the order as a scheduled maintenance. Thats what I wanted in the first place! But they insist on turning it into an issue!

I have worked as a automotive technician and a service writer and expressed it pretty loudly and to stop trying to bs me through this. They did the service. I paid. I drove a few miles. Wala. Their $1000+ parts and labor was fixed for $34.99 plus tax. Im grateful for this however I am very disappointed in this shop, when a customer comes in and has to tell them how to do their job. The technician I had though was very mature, understanding, and communicated well. I called this shop specifically to ask for him, told him the vehicle was fixed and thanked him. Fat chance you would get his service for the amount of techs there and the amount of service advisors you have to go through.

Long story short, if you dont drive a super common car, good luck getting service.<//review>< Response>

Also they all throw so much attitude and one department will say one thing and the other will say something completely different.

An earlier visit was negated because the reference that one of your sales personnel used for replacing a burned out license plate bulb was incorrect. I returned with defective bulb in hand and that took care of it.</Text>

Simply horrible. Dropped off my car at 1:30 PM or so. I explicitly stated that I need my car by 4:00 PM. I returned the store at 5:00 PM and they had not finished anything on my car. The rep then proceeds to tell me that I did not have an appointment and did not write down that I need my car at 4:00 PM. Sad truth is that they did not care and it seems as the norm.</review>

Over 3 hour wait to replace one tire which was way overpriced. Employees were nice but has to be one of the least efficient places in LA. I would go elsewhere if possible.<//review>

Bad service I made appointment then I get there they tell me to get to my car is a 3hr waiting! So what's the point of making appointments is there is no guarantee they would take you ,, try to speak with the manager but they just give me excuses if they can find him I don't recommend this pep boys 👎🏼<//Review>

Over 3 hour wait to replace one tire which was way overpriced. Employees were nice but has to be one of the least efficient places in LA. I would go elsewhere if possible.< /text>

(Translated by Google) It was the first time that I went to this place the day before I made an appointment so as not to go without an appointment but it turns out that the mediocre employee who always made my appointment did nothing to me so I got there and they did not attend me I do NOT recommend this place for this experience and I'm posting a photo so you can see that I was there.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) One Sunday I arrived at 8 in the morning for an oil change and unfortunately I had a very bad experience. They fixed my car until 7 o'clock and all those who were behind me in the morning attended to them quickly and I saw when many cars came and fixed them and mine was parked inside. I will never go to that store again and I tried to ask a question to a Latino worker dressed in a white shirt and I was annoyed by the owner who should run such racist people. I prefer to go to another I tend less this.

(Original)
Un domingo llegué a las 8 de la mañana por cambio de aceite y desafortunadamente tuve una muy mala experiencia. Arreglaron mi carro hasta los 7 horas y todos aquellos que iban detras de mí en la mañana los atendieron rapidito y vi cuando llegaban muchos carros y los arreglaban y el mio estaba estacionado adentro. Jamás iré otra vez en esa tienda y traté de hacer una pregunta a un trabajador latino vestido de camisa blanca y me atiendió enojado debería el dueño correr tipo de gente así racistas. Prefiero ir a otra tiendo menos esto.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have had a very bad experience in this place, I made an appointment at 10am to change the oil and supposedly it only takes 30 minutes by appointment and it was not like that because it will be 11:30 am and they will just start. So why the appointment? And today I realize that they never made the change. Wow thieves

(Original)
Me a quedado muy mala experiencia en este lugar  hice una cita a las 10am para cambio de aceite y supuestamente sólo tardan 30 minutos con cita y pues no fue así porque van a ser las 11:30 am y apenas van a empezar.

(Translated by Google) I do not know why they make appointments if they do not respect them more than an hour after the indicated appointment they put my car only for an oil change and it was because I arrived and I realized that I was not ready yet and they were putting other cars first really badly service should not take appointments because here is in order of preference

(Original)
No se porque hacen citas si no las respetan más de una hora después de la cita indicada metieron mi carro solo para un cambio de aceite y fue porque llegue y me di cuenta de que aún no estaba listo y estaban metiendo primero otros carros enserio muy mal servicio no deberían sacar citas porque acá es por orden de preferencia</review>
