This place is genuine, Rick and the staff have years of experience and gray staff that pay attention to detail.
They explain everything in a way anyone can understand. No games, real fair pricing, very timely and great warranty on what they fix. Usually during the holidays mechanics can best you up on price but not here.
It never felt awkward, never pressured, just welcomed.
They show you the parts they fix and they follow call you up a couple days after to ensure quality/answers. Lastly, they sanitize the vehicle before and after. This is my new family. Thanks Dorso's and happy Holidays.<//review>

Very professional atmosphere, remembers my name after a year of not seeing me. Took less than 18 hours for my car to be ready for pickup. Pricing is fair and they keep their shop very clean. Not to mention that Rick demonstrates his knowledge in a courteous manner and in such a way that even those unfamiliar with vehicles can understand and learn about their vehicle.< /review>

<Review>Dorso’s has been taking care of my family’s vehicles for most of my life. They’re good, honest mechanics. If you’re looking for cheap work, probably not the best choice, but you definitely get the quality you pay for here. Plus, they send you a thank you card after your first visit!</Review><response>None< /response>< Pics>

I dealt with Joe and Rick (hope I got your name right!).

Firstly, this was my first experience getting maintenance done in the bay area. So I was ready for some sticker shock. I had rear pads and rotors + oil change.

I was advised very well about what needed to be done, and what was recommended. I requested a few extra services be skipped and Dorso's obliged without complaint. So the sales approach is low pressure and friendly.

My only complaint was that I wasn't offered anything other than OEM or preferred parts. "Back home" many shops will offer cheaper (new) parts with your approval and if you waive a warranty on the service. I was NOT offered this and as a result the total was very pricey.

Lastly, I was entirely pleased with the professionalism. All removed parts were kept and shown to me. Everyone was very friendly. No one got upset when I refused additional services. And future service recommendations (and where to get them) were provided.

Dorso's seems like a great first stop for your auto service. In the future I might comparison price shop a bit before plunking down a ton of money for something I used to be able to do in my own driveway for 1/10th the cost. But perhaps that's just the way things are in the Bay Area... And since I can't service my own cars anymore, maybe I need to adjust my expectations.<//Text>

Brought my car here for and engine and cabin filter replacement. I found the team at Dorso's to be very professional and thorough with their work. I especially appreciated the COVID guidelines that were being followed at their location. I would definitely consider them again for future maintenance work.< /review>

<rating>4< /rating><text>With the new COVID guidelines still in effect, it was a bit of a challenge to get the appointment set up. The owner works at the shop, but has his off-site manager try and do the calls. A lot of back and forth. Tedious and a bit unnecessary.  I did an 75k tune-up, and get an issue fixed. It was a lot more than I cared to spend, but got it done. They also didn't tell me when the car would be done until I called them. They did a good job. Overall, I would recommend.< /text>< pictures>

Fantastic service from the moment I stepped in the shop. I learned about them from google and yelp reviews and decided to try them out. Making an appointment was not an hassle. Just pick up the phone and dial the number on their website( # on google does not work). I had to do a vehicle inspection for my car and Rick was so helpful on what package to choose. He has a good understanding of what the customer needs and he even follows up with photos and takes time to explain to you if you are interested. I would definitely recommend this service. Prices are also reasonable than other auto shops and dealers.</text>

I was also very nervous having my car worked on during the pandemic because I’m high-risk, but I wasn’t worried at all here!

<review>Fantastic service. Can’t recommend them enough!

Rick went above and beyond to make sure that a complicated problem with the steering module of my 06 Lexus GS430 was taken care of.

Not only that - but he was more than willing to quadruple check every issue to ensure that I would pass smog.

He also stayed much later so that I could pick up my car after work. Thoroughly inspected my vehicle and gave honest, unbiased, advice.

Thanks Rick! I will definitely be back.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fbf9b06560eed:0x80d37eaedbcc1944< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Best auto shop ever.  I appreciate honest auto mechanics since repair work can be so expensive or your car is misdiagnosed.  Dorso’s did an oil change on my car and discovered a brake fluid leak, which they said should be covered under my manufacturer warranty, since my car isn’t even two years old.

My vehicle was worked on by high quality individuals. The problems where fixed fast and done correctly. These guys know what they are doing.

Rick makes you feel very welcome at his shop and is completely honest. He did not overwhelm me and He always made sure I understand what was wrong with my car. The thing that I appreciated the most was how Rick kept me updated and took the time to explain to me what I have to do to prevent further damage to my vehicle. He also took the time to contact a tire shop to grab a quote for me.

I can’t not stress how much I appreciated the way they run things at Dorso’s Automtive Repair and take the time to talk with their customers.

Also, I trust Dorso’s Automtive Repair with my Fiancé’s vehicle who had car trouble the next day I picked mine up. would highly recommend Dorso’s Automtive Repair to anyone who is having car trouble. You will not regret it.

They are the best shop in Fremont or anywhere for that matter. Even if they're busy they'll try to fit you in. Total professionalism is what you can expect< /text>

Dorso's is the most outstanding automotive repair shop in Fremont. I've been to many, but none can compare with the outstanding mechanical knowledge, excellent customer service and personal touch that Dorso's provides. I have an old classic and wouldn't trust it to anyone else. When I pick up my car, I don't just get a receipt with a list of repairs attached to it: I get a detailed and rather lengthy printed report explaining what was done. Joe personally reviews and thoroughly explains to me each part of the report. He even shows me the old parts that were replaced.  This shop is honest and trustworthy and prices are comparable. When you drop off your car at Dorso's, rest assured that you're leaving it with the best of the best.< /text>

<text>Dorso’s continues to provide excellent, thorough, efficient, professional, friendly  & honest service.

Several months back on a routine service, there was an initially unknown problem after getting my car back. Pete worked on my car, even on the weekend (and they’re not open on the weekend, plus he had a funeral to attend).  I was supposed to get the car back on Saturday but Pete was unable to reach me, despite several phone call attempts (I was in an area with no service). Dorso’s had already provided a rental for me & graciously let me keep through the weekend. Definitely above & beyond service! Thank you!</text><user_id>100253412440382105800</user_id>< date>

<Review>I brought my 1997 Honda Civic to them when my windshield wipers went out--right before the big rain! Yikes! They had the parts in stock and were able to get me taken care of right away.  They also provided a prioritized plan to keep my poor old Honda running. The staff are all warm, courteous & professional, and I really appreciate being able to bring my car to someone I can trust.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fbf9b06560eed:0x80d37eaedbcc1944</Gmap_id></record>

Took my dodge charger here when it started having some problems. They were able to fit me into their packed schedule and have my car running great before closing for the weekend. Customer service was great and kept me updated throughout the repairs.

Thanks for the car wash as well.< /Review>

<text>Dorso’s was clear and detailed about everything that my truck needed. After a total of 100,000 miles my truck is running smoother than in the past five years. I am very happy with my experience with Dorso’s; hopefully my truck will drive another 100,000 miles under Dorso’s care.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< user>

<Review>I am highly satisfied with the customer service and auto services provided by the team at Dorso's Automotive. It's an anxious and stressful experience when you have car problems and especially thinking about finding a mechanic that will be honest and qualified to do the repairs needed. From my first interaction with Lori, Rick, Rob, and Joe - they explained every single step of the process from identifying and diagnosing what the root cause was for my car stalling to explaining what needs to be done to address the problem. As a female, I am wary of being offered services that I do not need. But that never happened with Dorso's Automotive. They were efficient in finding what was wrong and were timely in fixing and repairing my vehicle once they knew what was going on. They provided me a clear and fair estimate of total cost for the repairs and even worked to give me discounts where it was possible. When I picked up my car, they gave me a rundown of everything that they worked on in my car and showed me the auto parts that they removed and replaced. To me, it is always a good sign when a mechanic shows you the car parts at the end - it's a sign of honesty and attention to detail.  After getting my car back, it runs better than when I first bought it from the dealership. I will definitely continue to go to Dorso's Automotive for all my needed car maintenance and repairs.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Brought my car in for the second oil change.  I have known Rick since he was in high school, as he and my son are good friends.  I hadn't brought my car to him before because I had a deal with the shop I was using that gave me free oil changes for life for a fee, which paid for itself in two oil changes!!!  They closed their shop so I began taking my car to Rick at Dorso's.  Rick, Joe and Tristan are all super nice guys and they are as honest as they come when it comes to working on my car.  They are extremely thorough, and HONEST.  They go over the invoice with you step by step.  Plus, if you are local, they give you a ride home and pick you up when your car is done.  I won't take my car any place else now. Thanks Rick, Joe and Tristan for being so awesome!!<//text>

I won't take my vehicles anywhere else. This shop has been maintaining my family's vehicles for 20+ years, and now that I'm an adult on my own, I continue to take my vehicles here. Professional, clean, respectful, transparent and prompt. Rick and his crew are extremely thorough, taking the time to explain everything in simple terms. Their technical knowledge and decades of experience puts other shops to shame. He will even keep your broken worn out parts to show you, when you come to pick up your vehicle and walks you through all the repairs made. There is no guess work and parts changing here; they expertly and properly diagnose the problem and then promptly contact you to inform you. I recommend them to all my friends, coworkers, neighbors and have yet to hear a single bad thing about their shop. You will not be disappointed with them, don't waste your time going elsewhere. East Bay's best kept auto secret.< /Text>

My wife and I have been bringing our vehicles here for years and we recommend them to everyone we know.  Rick and Joe are great guys, very honest, clearly explain everything...not condescending at all.  They treat both me and my wife with great respect, friendliness, and helpfulness.  They're honest about what repairs really need to be done, which can wait, etc.  Every time your car is worked on they go over a printout with you with tons of detail, answer any questions you have, etc.  Couldn't recommend them more.</review>

The guy's at Dorsos went above and beyond when looking at my car. Not only pointing out some crucial variables wrong with my car, they made the repairs at an affordable price. They sincerely take it personally when it comes to making sure your car is absolutely safe for driving. The owner of the shop (Rick) walked me through the inspections they made and the repairs they were gonna do to remedy the problems, so through the entire process, I was kept in the loop. Rick understands that not everyone is car savvy, but makes sure to explain it making sure even a novice could understand. Not many places do that, but this place does. The people at this shop are extremely professional and I recommend anyone and everyone to give them a shot. You won't regret it!< /Review>

Dorso's is a credible and trustworthy service center. On every visit you get an A-Z report on your car and I NEVER feel like they are suggesting additional repairs to bump up the bill. If you are looking for a trustworthy team to take care of your, try them out.<//Text>

One of the big challenges when you move to a new area is to find businesses you can trust. We were fortunate to have a friend recommend Dorso's back in 1999 and we have been loyal customers ever since...with 2 cars reaching over 200000 miles each and with a third we know they will see through to that milestone. Amazing attention to detail and top notch customer service makes them the best trusted advisors you could find for your motor vehicles, and for a reasonable price.<//Review>

Dorso's services all three of my vehicles.  I live 45 miles from Dorso's and will tolerate the traffic due to the fact that I can trust these people.  I believe the feedback they provide and satisfied with the service they perform.  I have been trusting Rick, Joe, and the boys since 2001.  I highly recommend Dorso's.<//Review>

Everyone I interacted with at Dorso's was very nice and helpful. We had a small miscommunication about the work, which was initially annoying but they more than made up for it. They didn't end up doing any major work on the truck (trying to decide about fixing or trading it in) so I can't speak to that, but the customer service was great.<//text>

These guys are so good. They told me what was wrong and made sure that it was the correct problem. They didn't try to cheat me out of money by telling me my car will never work again or giving me false info. They even gave me two options on how to get it fixed. They also put washer fluid in my car and cleaned the outside of it. I will for sure be going back to them if i need more work in the future and will always recommend them< /text>

I picked this place because of the reviews. Glad to see that it held up. The service was awesome, and they were very upfront about what was needed/not needed.

They even brought me to work and picked me up as I had to leave the car in the shop all day. Would recommend this place to everyone.</text>

<Review>Rick, owner of Dorso's, is trustworthy and honest.  He will go everything with you and explain if you don't understand.  When my car goes off dealer warranty I will definitely be taking to Dorso's.  This is the only place I recommend to family, friends clients.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

We always come away from the experience knowing they have performed quality work (always stand behind everything they do) and are fair and honest in the process. They will always tell you everything that needs to be done to the car, but don't apply pressure if you tell them you need to wait on some of the less critical items. We have recommended Dorso's to our friends, and will continue to do so in the future!<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I went to smaller garages to have my 2003 Tacoma fixed for failing smog due to a fuel EVAP system-related check engine code.

I paid a lot to have a thorough diagnostic performed, and the quote to replace my fuel EVAP canister (aka charcoal canister) was even more than I had already spent at other garages, so it was a little discouraging at first.

However, in addition to this quote I got the full technical report which was highly professional. They were also willing to answer my questions that came up as I tried to replace the canister myself.

Ultimately I was able to do the replacement myself and clear the code to successfully pass smog. The relatively expensive diagnostic was money well spent at Dorso’s, because I was able to take the report and figure out exactly what to do and ended up saving money. They are very competent and provided excellent support. I will absolutely return to them in the future whenever my family’s vehicles have complex problems.< /Review>

< review>
After having two vehicles to this shop recently, one of which involving a non-typical engine mechanical problem, I am extremely pleased with the results.  The mechanics and leadership are professional, highly competent, and respectful in their relationships with customers.  Though not a normal repair for them, I was impressed with their diagnostic knowledge and capability, and effectiveness in researching potential issues with my '03 Z06 Corvette.  They handled the replacement of a broken valve spring, and the other 15 springs per my request, along with some other work in outstanding fashion.  They may not be the cheapest, but when you consider the technology, special tooling, and staffing requirements to handle these types of repairs well, they are a true value in comparison with a dealership and other less capable shops.  I was also impressed by the level of transparency and honesty, and loved their attention to gathering and tracking all historical data associated with the car for current and future reference.  I also thought their lead mechanic was outstanding.  Glad to have found this shop for my future needs.</review>

With a choice as to who I use, I only use some of the best in the area that I am at.  Dorso's Auto Repair is one of those I trust to fix my car right, the first time when in the Fremont area!  The staff treats me like a person and the Technicians always find and correct my vehicles issue(s).  Trust Dorso's, they have certainly earned it with me and many, many others!</Review>

I'm so grateful to have found this shop.....I am from Colorado and was working out in the bay area as I.B.E.W. wireman.....I badly was in need of some repaurs on my 2006 dodge ram 1500 and needed to.get back home to Colorado....the brakes were shot the strutw were shot I had a busted exhaust I also had a wheel hub that was done..... Rick and his team at this shop deserve more than a 5 star rating they go beyond not only to help show and explain what needs to be done but to keep you involved in the progress....very efficient and cost worthy.....I can't say enough about this shop and their team...keep up the great work guys THANK YOU ALL so much...your time and extreme efforts are more than appreciated<//Review>

<text>I recently had my truck checked out by these guys as I was prepping for a long drive out of state and my truck has been into another shop but seems that the issue is still there. The crew at Dorso's approached the situation from the day I called them, to dropping off my truck, providing much-needed updates during the fix/process especially if they found something that wasn't discussed during the handover, providing detailed recommendation for the fix and estimate of it, to the pick-up day and final walkthrough of what they found and have done and what to look out for... was hands down awesome!

My professional line of work involves collaborating with customers and requires thorough communication along the process. As my former boss always say - let's delight our customers and give them a positive experience they will never forget... The whole crew at Dorso's exactly executed this kind of service and this is the first time I actually having experienced this as the customer.

My only regret was that I should have decided to come to Dorso's the first time.

You guys are Rockstar!

Thank you

I ask them for short term membership and they say that they offer only year contracts and I'm staying temporary here in Chico. Even with that they refuse to finish the call and the guy end the call on my face saying have nice day !!
Its very rude and I wish they know how to talk with clients
And I wish they are understand different situations like me
But you know what I'm glad that I didn't join such a gym like this after this call< /text>

<Text>Open 24 hours using lots of cameras for security. Key fob needed to get in. Provides sweat towels and cleaner is required after use of equipment. Wide variety of machines although only 1 of each. Multiple cardio machines. Studio with work out programs to broadcast. Shower available, bring your own towel. Personal trainers there during the day with their door always open for help or advice.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80832896dca2036f:0x8eca3a78db44f348< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
I love this gym! It is the cleanest gym that I have ever worked out at and the staff are amazing. I've previously lived in LA, where I frequently worked out at Crunch Gym, LA fitness, and a couple other small joints around my area. Although this gym is small, there is never that many people in there that would ruin your workout. I workout 6 days a week and always can find a spot to lift and jump rope in-between sets. I really appreciate how they provide towels for sweat and a many bottles of disinfectant to clean the equipment with. At Crunch Fitness, they started charging you monthly just to have a small towel. Cleanliness of a gym I believe is extremely important. I once got a flesh eating bacteria on my hands and neck from other gyms. It cost quite a pretty penny for a poor college student to deal with. I recommend this gym to everyone I meet who is looking for a great place to workout.</Review>

Jason and Maria run a top notch facility. Between great equipment and a clean, relaxed environment, you won't find a better place to workout. Thank you for being the epitome of what great owners should be! If you're looking for a place to start a gym membership, look no further.< /Review>

<Text>Of all the gyms and fitness clubs I've been a member of, Anytime Fitness in Chico takes the cake. Aside from the obvious benefit of being able to go to your gym ANY time you want, the club itself is always clean, even the mirrors, walls and corners...never any dust or dust bunnies. They take pride in their club, you can tell...and I really appreciate a clean facility. All of the equipment is always in good working order, too. Compared to all of the other gyms in the area, I won't consider going anywhere else other than Anytime Fitness. Just a solid place all around! Thanks guys!</Text></record>

<review>This is by far the best gym in Chico. The owners are amazing and friendly. I recently had to cancel my membership because I moved and I hated doing it.

Maria and Jason, the owners, make this gym everything I could want and more. The security and setup makes me feel safe to go by myself at ANYTIME. I enjoy the pumped up music that's always playing. The bathrooms are clean and well kept.< /text>

<Text>The facility itself is great and I've always experience excellent and friendly service from staff, until today. After seeing an unexpected charge for my gym membership this month I called owner Jason Allen to request a refund. He became very upset and refused to refund me the overcharged amount stating, "some people pay $70 to come to this gym". After a heated discussion about why I should be reimbursed, I kindly asked to speak to his wife and co-owner Maria. He refused to let me speak with her stating, "she's not the owner, I am!" After informing him he was being unprofessional and stating I wanted to cancel the additional two gym memberships he became even more upset stating he could not find my name on any of the accounts and could not help me. After attempting to mediate the situation he finally yelled at me and told me to call in an hour and speak with Maria before hanging up on me. Maria called me two minutes later apologizing for his behavior stating, "it hasn't been a good day for him". Needless to say I will not be going back to Anytime Fitness and have cancelled my gym memberships. I will make sure to inform fellow co-workers and friends about my experience with owner Jason Allen. I encourage people to look at their bank statements to make sure they are not being overcharged and hope Jason isn't having "a bad day" when you call.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1515277559382, 'text': "Thankfully for Google my voice can be heard as well. Sorry for the way you felt you were treated.I also apologize I did not understand what you were trying to accomplish by cancelling your agreement, in which you said you already cancelled a month ago.Then because I do not understand what you need me to do, you become irritated, and personal stating I'm having a bad day. My members are my family and never once would I try to take advantage of them. My previous reviews prove this!\nIn the end you still got your way,  Maria the owner made sure of it. The way you felt you were treated is unfortunate, however I feel I was treated the same way. Not everyone needs to be, or deserves to be a  part of the Anytime Fitness Family. Thankfully Chico has other wonderful gyms for you to join."}<//Response><gmapID>0x80832896dca2036f:0x8eca3a78db44f348< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The best staff I’ve ever delt with, always a clean gym. Jason and Maria have done a phenomenal job at building this gym up to what it is today along with the personal trainers they’ve had. They accommodate for mostly all lifting/training styles and I’ve never had a real negative experience here which is a plus considering I’ve been here over a year and a half now.  The new expanded gym is more than enough room aside those occasional busy times.  They have a wide variety of lifting/training equipment and accessories along with cardio equipment. I highly suggest this gym!</review>

Do not recommend this gym at all. I got a free week pass online and the gym did not accept it. I really wanted to get a membership with my partner but after this I’m no longer interested.

I would never deny someone from something that is free it’s so disrespectful and absurd. The worker discriminated against current students even though I was recommended this gym by a Chico state alum.

They deserve no stars and the worker should be ashamed. You should never make a customer feel worthless and I hope the worker never experiences what I have experienced.<//Text>

<Review>Just moved to the area and called twice in the past 5 days (on 2 different weekdays mind you) and no one answered the phones. So today I decided to come by today (a Sunday) at just before 3 and see that it says Saturdays and Sundays are by appointment only...Making it so hard to get a membership seems ridiculous. Despite other positive reviews I can say that I will not be making a fourth attempt to try and become a patron of this gym.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This club had a lot less to offer than the other ones in the area.  It’s just machines and weights, and they have TRX straps pointlessly hanging from the wall.   Not a lot in the way of calisthenics or equipment for athletic movements.  Would only recommend if you need a 24 hour club and just want some machines. Seriously, not even a dedicated pull up bar.  Having it attached to the weight machine is not the same. I wasnt greeted by anybody and the lady seemed a little unhappy today. No smile, no tour. I can tell they get a lot a seven day free trials  and they seem to be annoyed by it. The gym was clean but there were multiple cleaning bottles on top of the machines.   I was treated a lot better by the nsfit club in the same area.</Text>< Pics>

Very nice place to shop for my braiding needs... I loved the fact that it is blacked owned... stayed there a while talking with the owner and I was totally pleased...will travel there again before I ever go to a beauty supply store that's owned by these RUDE! Asian's that Los Angeles has splattered all around.</text>

Black Owned! And guess what!? She answers questions about the hair products and your texture. Go to this store ladies, you'll probably over spend. Also I'll be buying my wigs from there from now on 😊< /review>

<text>I went to another beauty supply store right across the street called Beauty 4 U and I didn’t like my experience. They were following me around and making me feel real uncomfortable. I decided to leave and come to Adaora and Briana was such a great help when I came in. She had amazing customer service and she was genuinely  patient and polite with me. Whenevwr I visit Cali I will definitely be coming back here. 🖤</text>< name>

I am so happy to see this! I went there and the service was great! Also, I had not ever been to a beauty supply that stayed open so late! And they have a wide variety of great products for my hair! They are on to something good! These ladies GET IT! I wish them much success with their business! I am definitely a new customer!</Review>

Well...I'm rating this a 3 but not because of any personal experience or visit but because of the reviews being so empowered by a black owner and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that but you make someone like myself  feel that you  almost should be black if you want to shop there!<//text>

<review>I am so glad I found this shop. Everywhere was closed. I just happened upon this shop and to think it just recently opened a couple of weeks ago. Nice! Extra bonus that it is a Black-owned business. Chinecherem was super nice and helpful. I highly recommend you check out this shop.< /review>< pictures>

He said the price is not bad, it was $10 but he waited exactly ONE HOUR for that. He says that while he was waiting, another customer was mad about the waiting time as well. Anyway, when he finally got his food and was going to eat, he opened the plate and A HAIR was all over the food. Disgusting. He put it on the side and tried to eat anyway because he had been waiting for too long and didn't have more lunch time, but the food had no flavor whatsoever, the only thing with flavor was the chorizo. It's a shame, as a salvadorian, taking an hour for that kind of plate is ridiculous. Yes, I get it, it's a restaurant and there are more customers but still ridiculous. He said he isn't coming back.< /review>< Pics>

The pupusas are good and their empanadas too. Just be aware that if they tell you 30 minutes, it means 1 hour. Customer service is good.< /review>

The pupusas are good, the thing that I don't like is that they put enough tomate salsa. Y un buen Salvadoreño come mas curtido y salsa que pupusas.<//text>

<text>So came here with a friend who suggested this spot. Was super excited, said it was a good spot. Walking in there was no greeting. We stood by the register & was never told to sit until we started walking to a table. WARNING: If you love horchata DO NOT come here.. I should of known just by the color, was super dark, like a brownish grey, but I still gave it a chance. Turned out disgusting, worst horchata I've ever had. Switched it out for the pineapple drink & you could taste that they were borderline rotting. We waited about 45mins for our food although it wasn't even busy. Food was ok I guess, not good quality but also not too terrible, I honestly only ate cuz I was hungry.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVQti8AkY-qtlVyb9XBdSEjZtujgT9RDCsSMNk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

This place is soo underrated, but its food is pretty great, great flavor, and at great pricing too. I recently went with my husband and daughter  and  although  they make you wait 5 more mins or soo for your food its worth it. But I do want to make a suggestion  get an interior designer to help your  decorating because I feel like I'm in a bathroom  with  the white bath tiles on the walls where I eat, and waitresses that smile and have small talk skills because everyone looks like they're shy to talk or something. This place has potential  in my eyes.< /Text>

<Text>Food is okay, reasonable prices but place is filthy, smelly, and crowded, unfriendly staff. I have received on 3 different occasions wiped off dirty dishes, previously cooked and reheated pupusas. The walkway to kitchen had tall piles of dirty dishes with food and trash still on them. Also an occasional cockroach is not uncommon. This place was good about 1.5 years ago, not anymore. I haven't turned since<//Text><date>1548881752206<//date><UserId.>100018244390787860138< /UserId.><name>maria medina</name>< resp>

I want to give it 5 stars, I want to really, BUT the wait is long. And if you like to get your hands messy when eating(like I do) I suggest ordering A Torta De Al Pastor(Spicy Pork). For it is a More than generous Meal for only $4.50! That's a steal if you ask me. And like I said the wait is long, but worth the wait< /Text>

Love the daily specials, in particular the Wednesday special. Even with a lot of big orders coming in, your food comes out fairly quick. Good flavor, quantity is there. Would recommend.< /text>

I ordered enchiladas Salvadoreñas, and a chile relleno de queso plate. The food was good BUT it was too salty. Also, the owner should really think about repainting the place and getting new floors to attract more clientele. The colors are not attractive at all.<//Text>

Great homestyle cooking vibe, the food here is awesome and the prices are very reasonable. I eat here almost everyday and never had any issue with service or long waits. However, the downside is the restaurant is small.< /review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The place is not the cleanest in the area. It is quite small but you will almost always find a place to sit. The food is of medium quality. Reasonable prices. They have a special menu for each day of the week. Wednesday is Pupusas for $ 1 which is good. I do not park. Only on the street.

It bothered me a lot and it made me not listen and ignored me for another 10 minutes until another worker came in the afternoon shift to stop charging me and be able to return to work Wow really bad service

<Review>I have been a resident at Atlas for about a month now and have absolutely enjoyed my time so far. My boyfriend and I visited most of the new apartments in downtown Oakland and this was by far our favorite. There were so many different layouts to choose from and we are happy with our choice of a 1b/1b with a den space that acts as a home office / guest room. The amenities are A+, the staff is wonderful and helpful, and the community here is so friendly! Truly feels like a luxury apartment that I feel lucky to live in. Thank you Alfonso for your time and effort to help us get settled here and find our favorite unit!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkKVRDrhzDUEwrX0UVlz-T4U9i_QNeTTxBIUm6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUhvQnF4hLS2wIFpcGJlK1KqRDi5MjvbYY7ZzF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzXpQNZZ0xlavdjac7Ur8KMXKOOqDtdpt7HIkk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>{'time': 1629069651008, 'text': "Lindsay Nelson, it's experiences like yours that really keep us motivated!"}< /Response><gmap_id>0x808f81acf2288525:0x5376ce20cab8ef92<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We are almost two months into our residency and everything has been great! Our experience began with Addison in the leasing department. He was amazing! His tour was thorough; he was extremely patient and answered all of our questions and took us back to see a unit multiple times; and he ended our tour with a personalized, handwritten note.  It was as good of a customer experience as you could want. As our move in day approached, he thoughtfully answered all of our questions.  It was a great start to our time at Atlas.
The amenities here are terrific and the staff are great.  The app makes life easier in these hectic times and provides an easy way to communicate with your neighbors. Look no further if you’re hoping to move downtown.<//text>

<review>Alfonso was incredibly knowledgeable and patient in helping us choosing our new home. Units are beautiful and have the most stunning views of the Bay and Lake Merritt . He has also been fantastic through the entire process.
The team made us feel welcome, amenities were the best of all the apartments we toured. The gym and sunset lounge are 10/10. I would recommend Atlas to anyone seeking a modern lifestyle with resort-like comfort. Thanks Atlas team and especially huge thank you to Alfonso for all the assistance and support!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2LRFeDXEd7lUP1xSnAS5m4v_vkNfw_kj7RCUb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXFOwCNYbJb62nDFQ5yrGet92-JQ6eX1umfMbN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1622081142255, 'text': "Coco, thank you so much for your high rating!

I am one of the owners of The Golden Bull, a bar and music venue, across the street from Atlas. We've been working with Atlas since fall of last year. We started with first Friday door to door cocktail deliveries for their residents due to the pandemic. What a beautiful space they have! We saw the entire construction process as it happened and we were impressed by its scale. When they finished the tower section and completed the rooftop bar I was amazed with the panoramic view of Oakland- a view I've never been afforded in all my years in Oakland. Absolutely breathtaking! The bar area itself is incredible as well. My contact at Atlas, Amy, has entrusted us to service all of their bar events and she's been great! The building is wonderful (oh, I forgot to mention the modern lobby, with concierge etc-fantastic looking and functional), the staff is incredible, and the residents are great. We look forward to all of our events at Atlas. They're a fantastic addition to the downtown Oakland neighborhood! Great job Atlas!!! Thanks for being our neighbors.< /text>

< Review>
Atlas is an incredible high rise apartment with great views, excellent staff, and fantastic amenities. I moved in after a friend recommended Atlas in April and I have had nothing but amazing experiences since. Atlas has been incredible about COVID mask mandates, ensuring the safety of residents, and going above and beyond even to help deliver packages and checking in on residents when greeted in the hall.

I personally want to thank Joseph who was my leasing agent for finding me my dream apartment — when I called to inquire about the apartments he immediately asked about my preferences and found the apartment I now call home. I've never lived in a place with such amazing staff to care for the residents. Atlas is an amazing space with a bustling community, a beautiful place to live.<//Review>

Been an Atlas resident for about 3 months now and have 0 complaints. The community and amenities are seamless. The attention to every little detail to curate a positive experience is impressive and makes all the difference. Shout out to Joseph for being the most helpful. This is the definitely the nicest place I have (and maybe will ever) live.<//Text>

<review>Do you know when people ask you what do you want in life and why do you work hard for? Well, the answer became clear to me when I moved to this building. This is a dream coming true, is a definition that you succeeded. Having everything the Bay Area can give you close by and, not to mention, how this building is inside, a true 5-star resort that you can actually live in! The staff, community, amenities, everything is 5+ stars and all the reviews here are 100% accurate. My decision to rent here was mostly based on the reviews because I came from the East coast and couldn’t tour in person before moving (India helped me with online tour which made me confirm my decision) and what I can say is that everything mentioned in the reviews are accurate. Come and be part of this amazing community!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I've never been happier to call a place home! Atlas has everything I need from dog spa, dog run, sunset rooftop lounge, fitness center, hot tub, and more! The staff here are amazing and always go out of their way to help. You're always greeted with a friendly and smiling face no matter what :). I never want to leave.<//Text>

<Review>Moving from Texas, my wife and I looked all over the Bay Area and we settled with the BEST. Addison at the leasing office went over and beyond what is expected from a leasing office and helped us through every step of the process. I can't recommend him enough! The staff from concierge, maintenance, leasing, and the 3rd party parking garage company have been fantastic. If you're looking for a new home with the best customer service, amazing views, and stellar apartments then look no further!< /Review>< Pics>

We love living at Atlas! Addison was a huge help narrowing down floor plans and with ultimately choosing an amazing apartment. It wasn’t a hard decision after touring the fantastic amenities. Addison made leasing from another state efficient and easy! He was always timely with responses and kept the process moving seamlessly. Let Addison show you your new home…you won’t be disappointed!</Text>

I have lived at Atlas for almost a month and have loved every day here. As a female living on my own, safety and security was my biggest concern. Atlas has a lot of security measures in place including for garage and general access. Building is pretty new and units are very nice. Lots of amenities! My leasing agent was Joseph, he was very informative and in general, all the staff are kind, welcoming, prompt and professional.< /text>

<Review>If you're reading this to decide whether or not you want to move to Atlas, I'll tell you right now the answer is unequivocally, yes. My husband and I have lived here for a little over one year now (moved from San Francisco to Atlas in Oakland at the end of May 2020) and are blown away by several key factors here: the staff, apartment design features (interiors and exteriors), amenity spaces and the apartment events.

The staff:

Joseph was the first person we met at Atlas and helped us throughout the entire leasing process last year. His energy was super contagious and even though some features of Atlas were not yet complete/opened at that time (due to the building being in new construction AND the pandemic) he was able to bring us completely on board with his excitement in the upcoming (but now open) spaces and features. Other members of the leasing staff (Addison, India, Alfonso) and management, (Amy and Selwyn), are the best team I've ever encountered. Our maintenance staff as well is incredibly responsive, friendly and a key role in keeping everything here so beautiful.

Concierge staff is 24/7 and once you move in you'll be quick to recognize these friendly faces: Roosevelt, Richard, Brayan and more! Not only are they all incredibly helpful in answering questions involving the in's-and-out's of the building and its features, but this team is so ridiculously kind and patient and somehow know every. single. resident. here (and there are a lot of us...). They are some of the first faces you'll get to know and likely will be the individuals you talk to everyday (whether that's just to chat or ask questions).

Apartment design + amenity spaces:
Every single color, light fixture, piece of furniture, and even down to their insanely popular coffee machine, is intentional. My friends tell me they feel like they're at a 5 star hotel or luxury resort.

Their gym? Chef's kiss. Cancel your Equinox membership.

The 41st floor has a huge game room, separate movie theatre lounge and an absolutely stunning cocktail and private dining lounge. I don't want to spoil the surprise but fairly certain your jaw will drop once you see it. The 4th floor also has amenities like a co-working (WeWork-like) space, pool, hot tub, grill and event space. There is also the 3rd floor (outdoor) pet park that undergoes extensive cleanings multiple times a day, and is next to their pet wash room.

Apartment events:
The events here are so, so fun (and there are a ton to choose from). Not only are these a great way to meet your neighbors (everyone is incredibly social here), but it's also a wonderful way to learn about local businesses in the area. There's a mix of food / cocktail events either in the amenity spaces (where the spread is, again, chef's kiss) or hosted at the actual restaurants / bars themselves! Supporting the local community is so important to me, and I'm sure many others, and Atlas has done an incredible job in making sure we get to know the community we live in. In addition to food events, we've had things like dessert and wine tasting events, pub crawls, monthly first Friday events hosted by a neighboring bar called The Golden Bull (which is apparently owned by one of the members of Green Day!), 2x weekly Swyft HIIT classes and 1x weekly Swyft Yoga classes, painting and cooking classes and more.

I will also mention just how unmatched the level of security here is.  24/7 building security patrolling the perimeters and inside the building. Your packages are secured in a lockage storage system and the parking garage is equally as secure and patrolled by building security. I haven't had any issues with our car here - I accidentally left my wallet in my car overnight and my car was totally fine (and the wallet was still there!).

If you couldn't tell, my husband and I love Atlas. I could go on and on about this place and how amazing it is, but you'll just have to see it to get what I'm saying. If you're still debating - just look at the other 100+ 5 star reviews on this place and see how it speaks for itself.</Review>< Pics>

This review is for parking only. We were stuck there for 30 minutes. Payment system doesn’t work properly. Support line doesn’t work. Gate doesn’t work. It was a terrible experience. We were also charged for 50 dollars for parking there for less than 2 hours. It was absolutely infuriating. The security person walked away after we asked him to helps us. It was the most terrible experience I have ever had. Do NOT park here ever unless you plan to stay forever. I would give it negative stars if possible.< /text>

The staff at Atlas are top of the line in every way. In all of my years of apartment renting I've never come across a staff more friendly, professional and timely!!! Shout out to my leasing agent Addison who was so amazingly patient and courteous when showing me the property/unit. He was available anytime for questions during and after my move in and continues to set the bar with excellent customer service. Not to mention is one of the best dressed in the building. Another nod to the front desk staff Reggie and Roosevelt who are beyond amazing! They are sweet and bubbly personalities which definitely hooked me into signing my lease. As the face of the building, they are always courteous and have an answer to any of my questions and are always available when I need help. This building is the standard to Bay Area living not only in amenities but in great tenant care. Work orders and requests are handled rapidly and done with a smile. I've toured several buildings in the area but only Atlas exceeded the bar. It feels like a fancy New York building you see in movies. You'd be a fool to live anywhere else!<//text>

<Review>Atlas staff is wonderful, kind, and accommodating. The price of living here is pretty intense but they host lots of community events and the perks-like the pool and amazing gym- help balance the cost. I am excited for when covid restrictions ease up since limited capacity has made it pretty hard to use some of the other amenities like the hot tub which is almost always booked all evening unless you plan to hot tub weeks in advance. Wish that parking was included or at least cheaper, the garage is an extra $200/month. Not a bad place to have a dog either since there is a dog park, however many residents’ dogs are not friendly and the owners will make you leash yours up to accommodate them. Overall 4/5.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1623957331975, 'text': "Ele, we are so happy to read such a great review about Atlas!

This review is for Addison. Yesterday I had booked a tour and Addison was our assisting leasing consultant. Atlas had so many amazing amenities, spacious floor plans, and pretty much anything anyone would want in a home. I think what sold me more what Addison's clear communication, willingness to help, and his attitude towards to property. He really represented Atlas in all the right ways. Unfortunately, I won't be renting, only because I secretly shopped him, but had I been seriously looking, I would have.

Great Job, Addison! You sold exceptionally and I loved the small detail you mentioned about the scientist and that light fixture! Goes to show you admire the property you work at.<//text>

TLDR: You won't regret moving to this beautiful community. It's not too good to be true, it's literally just the perfect place to live.

Atlas is SUCH wonderful place to live. I had the pleasure of working with Addison, who was incredible during the whole process of finding the right unit. Because of COVID and this being my first apartment, I had a TON of questions and took some time to tour (which he graciously let me do more than once because I was indecisive) and eventually signed the lease. He was SO patient and helpful the whole time, answering any questions I had, and I was eventually comfortable enough to make the decision to move here. Even when I signed the lease and had more questions about next steps, he was always ready to help and I really appreciated that.

When I moved in about a month ago, I was given my keys and upon entering my unit was greeted by a really lovely welcome gift. The quality of the units are fantastic: the floors, cabinets, appliances. Everything!

I had a bit of an ant problem when I moved in, not a trail but more like a few here and there (common with new construction) but the maintenance team was incredibly quick to add some caulking in the bathroom for me and schedule pest control! I haven't had any problems since.

What's really nice too, though I haven't used them yet, is the amenities. You definitely get what you pay for in a community like this. The concierge service, the work rooms, community events (COVID friendly), the gym space that we will soon have, etc.

Other random things I love:
- The windows, especially great when it's raining
- The bathroom tub is the most luxurious thing I've ever seen lol
- Front load washer and dryer
- Deep kitchen sink + pullout sprayer
- The heater gets really hot
- Staff is literally always friendly (I.E there have been times that I'm carrying a million groceries and one of the concierge will open the door for me and press my floor in the elevator which I think is really kind) + it doesn't end once you've signed the lease like other places that get your money and kind of drop the ball
- There's an app for the building where you can pay your rent, RSVP for events, check out local events in the area, etc

If you're thinking about this place, go for it! I can honestly say that I made a great decision moving here.< /Text>

<review>One month into living at Atlas and no regrets. I toured with Alfonso who was great the day of and very helpful in answering all of my questions afterwards given the short turn around I had to move. The concierge / front desk team is also great. The amenities, as many have pointed out, are amazing. In addition, there are many social events hosted to mix and mingle. Despite the luxury of the building, I find the staff and community humble and friendly.</review>< Pictures>

I’ve only been at the Atlas a little over a week, but I’m so happy I’ve decided to make it home. Alfonso, went above and beyond, touring several units over multiple days and answering all the questions from my friend and I. On the day of move in, Joseph was superb and ensured everything went smoothly. Shoutout to Roosevelt and the other concierges who helped make my move in process seamless and easy.< /text>

Alfonso is the best! The staff at other complexes have failed to reply in a timely manner and have even neglected showing up to virtual appointments. Alfonso, however, is extremely professional, knowledgeable, kind, and honest. I had a virtual tour of Atlas with him on Friday and he really took his time showing me the units/amenities, answering my questions, and scheduling a follow-up visit. Alfonso is wonderful at his job and I’m excited to continue to work with him.<//Text>

<Review>Amazing Apartment complex. India was my agent as I was searching for an apartment in Oakland. I ultimately didn't choose Atlas this time around, but India was probably one of the best agents I could have worked with. She was very accommodating, super personable and never made me feel pressured. Staff was amazing, and this is probably one of the nicest apartment complexes in Oakland.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Atlas is a league of its own in Oakland. By far the highest luxury community and professional staff. I feel comfortable and safe in my home considering the secured access garages and many helpful staffs throughout all the spaces. The management staff is quick to respond and address any questions and are very helpful and thorough with all of my needs. So glad I chose Atlas, couldn't imagine being anywhere else!</Review>

I have been living here since April 19th, and I'm loving everything about it. The common areas are very clean, and well managed. The gym is so well equipped, and easily accessible. The parking lot is very clean and well lit.  The staff that works here is very friendly and definitely costumer service focused. I leased my apartment with Alfonso and he made the process very easy and seamless. Not to mention he is very very patient! I feel very safe living here. Since it's a new complex, I'm really enjoying the modern look of the place, and not to mention it smells sooooo good! Looking forward to the summer time in Oakland, thank you Alfonso!<//review>

<Review>I helped my friend find a new home in Oakland and I can honestly say, Atlas is absolutely STUNNING! The amenities are amazing and the layouts of the apartments are spectacular. We toured with Addison and he was so helpful finding the perfect home. He made the stress of finding a home so much more fun! He was super knowledgeable about the property and so fun to work with. Also, the concierge was more than accommodating with all of my requests, even though I wasn’t a resident or applicant.

I highly recommend this apartment community to anyone who is looking for a welcoming staff, luxurious apartment in Oakland, and amazing amenities which are perfect for the current community climate we are in. If I was moving to Oakland I would most definitely lease at Atlas!</Review><user>117189536153982585248< /user><Response>{'time': 1610386629210, 'text': "Emmy Maye Desjardins, We're glad to hear we delivered such a great experience.

Just moved in recently. WOW WHAT AN AMAZING BUILDING AND STAFF. Seriously do yourself a favor and book a tour and check it out. Joseph Knaack was the man setting it up in the leasing office. Its been a huge productivity boost the amenities are nice and the vibe works. Used to live in SF. Atlas is much better than Nema & Solaire in SF< /review>

The concierge and other staff members are top notch and the amenities have to be some of the nicest of any building I’ve ever lived in.

I was tentative about moving into a new and quite large apartment complex in downtown Oakland in the middle of a pandemic, but I have to admit that The Atlas is one of the best things to come out of COVID for me! The Atlas has done a superb job of staffing and has been very conscientious about maintaining a high level of care the entire time I have lived here. As the pandemic restrictions loosen and the amenities become more widely  available, I foresee many more reasons to love living here!</review>

INDIA is AMAZING!!!!!
I had such a wonderful time touring The Atlas and I am so excited to be moving to this property. The first thing that we noticed was how friendly and genuine everyone was. We visited multiple times and called a thousand times, and everyone was consistently helpful and so happy to help us find the perfect place to live. The facilities are so beautiful! We toured with India, and she is a huge part of the reason we decided to live at The Atlas. She was so patient with us. She is so, so kind. And most importantly - so knowledgable about things that really matter when considering where to live (like how the building was constructed, etc). She really took the time to figure out our preferences and goals for the perfect apartment. I cannot wait to move in and have no doubt that I will be happy living there!< /Review>< pictures>

I have lived at a number of luxury buildings from Boston to California and currently I am coming up on the end of my lease in the absolute worst (separate review coming). Enter India and Atlas. I first met India about a month ago when I made an initial inquiry about Atlas. First off, she is extremely personable and inquisitive. She wanted to know what was important to me in finding an apartment and came up with a number of options to show me, but she also wanted to know about me. Usually when you go to check out a building, the leasing consultants are in selling mode, but I never felt that way with India. I truly felt like I was with a friend who was interested in helping me to find an arrangement that would work best for me. Once I picked my apartment, she was very attentive and responsive in following up as I had a number of questions (trying to make sure I didn’t end up in a situation similar to the one I am in now!). India put me at ease. Whether by email or text, I always got a thorough response much faster than I expected. I will be moving into Atlas next week and based on my experience with India, I am confident that the move-in will be smooth and that I won’t regret choosing to live at Atlas!< /Text>

I absolutely love this building! The friendly staff(shout out to Joseph & Roosevelt), the clean grounds, the amazing views, and the swanky style make this place an amazing place to live!
The location is great and there are so many small businesses to support really gives a great community feel. If you’re looking for a new home seriously consider moving here!<//Text>

<name>Jennifer Lam< /name><date>1609983358516<//date><Rating>5</Rating><review>I toured six buildings in Emeryville & Oakland and Atlas stood out as the top premier luxury residence, not only in the East Bay, but in the entire San Francisco Bay area.  I have moved 20 times and have lived in a variety of homes and luxury buildings and so far this one is my favorite. The finishes are gorgeous.
My tour with India solidified that not only is this a living community but it is a lifestyle and an experience that truly elevates the resident. The amenities are amazing between the pool, hot tub, 4,000 square-foot gym, 41st foot floor bar/lounge, and socially distanced workout classes. It was apparent that India truly embraces the Atlas experience as she emanates an amazing vibe throughout. During my tour with her it was apparent this was the building I wanted to choose and she could relate to the feeling that I had arrived at the perfect place. She was very clear on details and pricing an listened to all of my needs to find a tailored space for me at an amazing price. I secretly hope that she and I will be friends!
Happy to be a part of this socially conscious, forward moving and luxurious community!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1609988576886, 'text': 'Jennifer Lam, we are so happy to read such a great review about Atlas and India!

Wish I could give another star! Quality quality quality! From the moment we entered the lobby and received a greeting from the concierge desk, I knew the bar was going to be set!

Shortly after being seated, we were greeted with the bright spirited India! Not only did she make me feel like I’d known her for years, she was sooooo knowledgeable of all things Atlas. I left feeling well-informed! Between India’s 5 star service and the buildings beautiful aesthetic, it was definitely 10/10 would HIGHLY recommend.</review>

I've been purposely holding off on reviewing, wanted to give a fair assessment now nearly 6 months into our time at Atlas. We were among the first to occupy the tower, have seen steady progress wrt both completion/availability of amenities and resident move-ins.

Property: We've experienced minor hiccups as are to be expected with new construction: sewage odor leak from toilet, defective window, for example. All issues have been rectified. The building really is beautiful. And views from the 41st- floor community spaces: unmatched.

Staff: You'll interact on the daily with the concierge desk; these folks are some of the greatest people you'll ever meet. Super helpful and patient. Office and maintenance staff are great, too. With so much movement on the property, you'd expect requests would either go ignored or untouched for weeks. Responses are timely, service completed with a smile.

Neighbors: We're not yet sharing walls with anyone, so can't comment on noise, though will point out that sound carries up from the pool, so keep that in mind when selecting unit location.

Overall: We feel as though we live on a resort. Yes, rates are high. Though you get what you pay for: community events like yoga and HIIT classes, many free meals + booze, a well-designed gym with top-of-line equipment, package delivery management and so much more!<//text>

I was nervous to move during the pandemic and was pleasantly surprised how seamless everything was - Atlas has a dedicated load in dock which they will reserve for you and all the paperwork was handled via internet. The building is brand new and I was skeptical that the photos on the website were photoshopped like many properties do - this is not the case at all with Atlas and to be honest I think the amenities look exactly like the photos and possibly even better in person! Also - I heard Atlas hosts quite a few events to connect the residents with each other which I'm looking forward to. As you can probably tell, I'm quite impressed with Atlas and would highly recommend it! Also, looking forward to attending Oakland Roots pro soccer games in the summertime given Atlas is within walking distance... special thanks to Amy and Joseph for assisting me with my move in!<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1616630661897, 'text': "Taylor Beggs, thank you for sharing your positive experience!

<text>Atlas Oakland is by far the nicest luxury apartments in area, my roommate and I toured several other locations and we almost gave up because everything felt the same - but then we toured with Joseph at Atlas (who is an absolute superstar, incredibly personable and made us fall in love with our new spot :-) which completely wowed us!

We moved in a little over a month ago and the entire staff has been incredibly accommodating with all of our needs. Work orders have been addressed within the day, Roosevelt and Richard are amazing, our minds continue to stay blown - thank you, Atlas!<//text><gmapID>0x808f81acf2288525:0x5376ce20cab8ef92<//gmapID><user>112951094393910116212</user>< Rate>

Huge thank you and shoutout to Joseph, Roosevelt, Richard, and the whole Atlas team for making our move-in and residency here easy, comfortable and positive.

Atlas Oakland is just amazing ! I moved  in during the pandemic and things could not have gone any smoother. I had a virtual tour with Joseph who has the most enthusiastic energy and then subsequently met with both Joseph and Roosevelt and saw the unit in person.
So glad that I didn't hesitate to make the move . Everyone has been professional, helpful, and accommodating which in these unparalleled times this makes a big impact on feeling at home.
Concierge Roosevelt and Richard provide a very hospitable atmosphere that makes you feel well pampered
Joseph went above and beyond to pay attention to detail on all aspects of my move- Thank you Joseph!!!!
You were right I love it here!</review>

I've been mulling over moving to California from Atlanta for a while now, and I've always liked the feel of Oakland. I came across this building while looking for temporary housing, and I can say it fit all of my wants for an apartment. India, my leasing specialist, couldn't have been more professional. I enjoyed the phone conversation we had, as she was both bubbly and extremely knowledgeable. As a very busy financial advisor that travels a lot, I like my space at home to be peaceful, great for entertaining, with pleasant staff. India has made my experience great, and I look forward to her helping me find the perfect unit as soon as I finalize moving.<//Review>

I recently toured the Atlas Apartments in Oakland, in search of my new home. Pretty early into viewing the amenities throughout the building, it was clear that of all the apartment communities I had seen thus far, Atlas was exceptional. You can see the thought that went into the design and spaces for gathering, working, entertaining and relaxing. The apartments are very well-appointed with solid and quality finishes, and that includes solid real wood doors (a personal highlight for me). After seeing so many apartments, things start to look alike and you begin to forget which had what and all the little things that set them apart. I certainly will not forget the quality of the apartments, the ample kitchen cabinet space in the one bedroom (another pretty rare find, especially if you have a lot of cooking gadgets like I do) and the hammocks that are nestled within a serene outdoor corner hideaway. The only reservation I have about Atlas is the 14th and Franklin neighborhood as a single woman, not sure how walkable the area is for a woman alone.

If you are lucky to take a tour with Joseph, the leasing manager, you'll be in excellent hands. He's friendly, very knowledgable about the building and the surrounding area (even being from SoCal), the floorplans and he's just an all-around nice guy. I appreciate the time and care he took to show me and my sister around, knowing that although soon, I didn't plan on making a decision that day. Atlas has definitely made my short list of possible new homes.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>We moved in almost a month ago and our experience has been amazing so far! We looked all over Oakland and I can honestly say, no place we toured comes close to what Atlas has to offer. Joseph was incredible throughout the entire move in process! The tour of the building literally left us speechless but what sold us was the incredible staff ! After living here for a month, you can tell these units are made very well as I never hear my neighbors and outside noises. All the appliances are top notch which makes cooking really fun! They are still finishing up the building so you do notice some construction noises sometimes but it’s very minimal. If you’re looking for a luxury apartment in Oakland, you have to check out Atlas! The move in special is pretty sweet right now too!</text>< pics>

This place is beautiful. And I had very pleasant experience with leasing agent India over the phone.
She is not only professional but very knowledgeable and familiar with the building and the area. If you are looking for place here, get in touch with her. She will help you with everything you need.<//review>

< Review>
I moved into Atlas in August and, having moved between many apartments across a couple of continents, I can truly say that this is the best apartment building I have ever lived in. The building itself is beautifully finished and boasts amazing views out over Oakland. It is also situated very close to the lake and many bars and restaurants. While the amenities in the building are largely closed due to the ongoing pandemic, the team at Atlas has made every effort to bring joy to the community by offering fitness classes and a variety of virtual events, my favourite of which is the virtual happy hour on the first Friday of each month where cocktails from the golden bull are brought directly do the doors of residents' apartments, free of charge.

Though the apartments and the amenities are outstanding in themselves, the aspect of Atlas that sets it apart from other apartment buildings is its team. Roosevelt and Richard are both so friendly, and personable, and incredibly helpful; it's always a pleasure to see them in the foyer. When I toured the building before moving in, I was shown around by Joseph who was more than happy to answer any questions and did not exert any pressure to rush into any decisions, which was very refreshing. On the day that I moved there were a few hiccoughs (read: Uhaul last-minute cancellation) and Joseph went to great lengths to help make things run as smoothly as possible. He is an asset to Atlas, and in the months following my move, he has been consistently affable and accommodating; a genuine delight to interact with. Whatever the situation, the team go above and beyond, be it taking deliveries, calling the lift for you when your hands are full, or even just having some friendly chit chat. I would thoroughly recommend Atlas to anyone who is looking for a luxury apartment community within Oakland.<//Review>

<review>I have to give a huge shout out to all of the staff at the Atlas. I have never lived in an apartment where I knew names of all of the staff members in the building. Joseph, Richard, Roosevelt, Selwyn and Ryan are all amazing and made moving in during COVID super easy. I would highly recommend this place.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>These homes are stunning, it had everything I wanted and more. But what's more impressive is their customer service. Ryan is the most kind, thoughtful, and knowledgeable  leasing agent I have ever had the pleasure of working with. She took time and care to get to know me on a personal level and give me all the information I needed to make an informed decision.   You can't go wrong making Atlas your new home!< /review>< Pics>

Joseph is amazing.  I am moving from NC to CA and had to do all of my tours virtually.  He made sure to answer all of my questions and showed me all of the common spaces/amenities as well as the units I was interested in.  With most of the other virtual tours I got from other properties, they were lazy and only wanted to show my the one apartment that interested me, nothing else.  He also tried very hard to work with me to get into the property.

Unfortunately, coming from NC I couldn't justify to myself paying over $4500 for a two bedroom APARTMENT.  So I ended up in a different apartment in Oakland.  However, if their prices become a little more reasonable next year, I may be looking at them again.

Thank you Joseph!!</review>

< Review>
Atlas has everything a luxury apartment can offer and more!!! The views are breathtaking. The amenities, architecture, artwork and concierge really give the luxurious feel that is unmatched in Oakland (yes even better than 17th & Broadway) But what sets this place apart is the level of attention and genuine care each leasing agent provides. Joseph went above and beyond to not only make sure I found the exact apartment home that fit me but basically held my hand through the entire process. From lease signing, to moving, and to the curated Atlas welcome package that fit what I actually needed (Atlas dog leash. So dope!)

Thank you to the Atlas team and a special thank you to Joseph. Thank you for helping me find my dream apartment!<//Review>

I spoke to and worked with Ryan on finding my new home at Atlas. The unit is absolutely gorgeous and the amenities attached are great. Ryan did such a great job. The team seems like a great group of people ready to help and serve your needs. Highly suggest these high rise luxury apartments, and can vouch that the team will give you wonderful friendly service.<//Text>

From huge furniture deliveries to favors when my printer broke while WFH, this group has made me feel so at home. We moved during COVID and I can honestly say I have never had an easier experience. They are adhering to every SD guideline and I appreciate that more than anything.

Also huge plus is all the catered events they put on, the 'hard-hat tour' being my fave. I would highly recommend this place to anyone, and have! Think about it-- folks usually review when things go wrong. The fact that so many of us love it here is a true testament to Atlas/Greystar<//text>< Pictures>

Excellent staff and great community of neighbors who hangout regularly. I've lived in apartments where you never meet a soul! But @ Atlas you'll find a friend on day one. Also the onsite fitness classes offered to residents are NEXT LEVEL. 💪🏾<//Text>

Very unprofessional. Expected me to learn the stock room in 1 day. Instead of firing me appropriately they removed me from a group chat and I never recieved termination papers. Kevin (the manager) likes to make remarks on how white people dress in the stock room or how big a ladies foot is and makes fun of all the customers.< /text>

<Review>No one is perfect that's why I never give a 5 star rating but this place deserves it. Cool place to shop, was greeted, felt welcomed as soon as I walked in and was helped immediately. I was in and out in less then 10

< Review>
The lady who helped me cash out my shoes had bad customer service. I did not receive my money nor handed my bag in a well manner. She had a boy hair cut, employee #533160. Started bad since the beginning with “hey what’s up” ?? NOT PROFESSIONAL! First time this happens and I come here often. She was RUDE! I don’t know who hires someone like her! Ugh!<//Review>

They didn't have my shoe size on a pair of Levi's boots I like, so they had to order them online. The first pair they delivered had deep scratches on the front of the boot so I had no choice but to return them. they offered to return them for me and also ordered a new pair. The second pair I received also had some scratches but also part of one of the boots was dried and discolored. Don't ever buy shoes or boots from them online, ever!</Text>

This place is fairly hidden. It's open from 10am-4pm, I believe.  They have a few animals but they definitely could use some more. Also there are A LOT of yellow jacket bee's here, so be careful. 🐝🐝</Text>

Small but very cute. The animals looked well-cared for and everything was very clean. Happy San Dimas has a place like this to educate us all about the natural places around us.</Review>

Unfortunately the bottom portion is closed so you can not see the live deer and other animals.  Only the small upper room is open. Not real entertaining for a 7 year old.</review>

< Review>
We installed a solar system on the roof: everything went perfectly, from the initial analysis and offer, all the way to the installation, activation and permission to operate. I worked with many people during the process, but always got quick and prompt responses for all the questions that I had during the process.<//Review>

NRG Clean Power just installed a 9.4kW solar system on my house. Their price was competitive and they made the process super easy. The sales advisor Kasey and my project coordinator Miranda Stiles were both awesome. Miranda always responded quickly to me if I needed her attention. As for the system itself, so far so good. It just does what it is supposed to and pumps out those electrons for me. Thank you NRG Clean Power.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I did a great deal of homework before I purchased my solar system.  I received proposals from 8 different companies and NRG had a great price with amazing service even before the sale!  My sales person, Antoinette, was able to quickly answer all of my questions and met my expectations 100% of the time.  Sherry Avni coordinated the installation and walked me through the entire process gracefully and professionally.  She was great! If I had any issues or questions, she would quickly address them and keep the process moving smoothly.  The installers were total pros.  Not only did they install the panels, but I needed to move and upgrade my electrical panel.  The electrical panel turned out amazing and they even patched the area where the old panel was like it was never there!  I am a super happy customer and love my new roof top power generator from NRG!<//Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>NRG Clean Energy installs solar cleanly!!  All conduit ran through the attic for great curbside appeal.
Thanks to my project coordinator, Sherry Avni, the whole process was smooth.  I always knew what step was next with an estimation how long to expect something to take.

All my engineer questions were answered in timely manner (most often on the same day within a few hours).

Great customer care, service, installation, price, and most importantly solar financing.

Give this company a shot to install your solar.  I'm glad I did.< /Text>< user_name>

<Text>This is an updated review.

After having some issues the Director of Operations reached out to me directly to emphasize the company focus of customer service and connected me directly with an engineer to get a better understanding of my needs and clear up any confusion.  I am now hopeful and somewhat confident that we are on track to get a system specified and installed that meets my needs.</Text><GmapID>0x80c29c16766710ed:0xe696d7b2b95f8b89< /GmapID><resp>{'time': 1621885754560, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving a review and sharing your experience with NRG Clean Power.\n\nWe value customer satisfaction above all, and we are confident that any issues you may have had have been or will promptly be resolved.\n\nThank you again for choosing NRG Clean Power!\n\n-Tyler'}<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

My wife and I considered solar for years and spoke with many companies. We set the bar high when making big financial decisions and none of the companies was able to provide a level of knowledge and professionalism that we were comfortable with.  When we revisited installing solar this past year we were introduced to NRG Clean Power and we finally found the right match. Our Project Coordinator, Leila Gorney, was there every step of the way. She kept the project moving, kept us informed, and always had an answer for my many, many questions. Their surveyors, electricians, installers, and everyone we came in contact with were professional and personable. Our HOA required a roof inspection after NRG made the roof penetrations for the mounting brackets. When the roofing company forwarded the report to me they wrote in an email:

“I will have you know that our inspector was very pleased with the work of your solar installers! They did a great job.”

I could go on but I think you get the point. NRG is a first-rate solar company. Our panels are producing as specified, we’ve achieved our energy goals, and we were 100% satisfied with the entire process. Based on our experience I would highly recommend NRG Clean Power.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>We chose NRG for our solar installation. Everyone we worked with (especially Gemma and Leila) was incredibly helpful and responsive along every step of the process. They responded to emails and texts within a day or two at the most, but usually within a couple of hours. They were patient and very helpful with all of the questions we had (and we had many!), and they were happy to coordinate with other contractors that were doing work on our house at the same time. We did a fairly detailed analysis of the quality, cost, efficiencies, and expected lifetime of the equipment that NRG proposed compared to other companies, and we are confident that they provided the best equipment at the best cost. The installers that came to our house were very professional, worked quickly, and the system was up and running within hours - very impressive. We passed our inspection with no issues and the whole process was completely painless! We are very impressed with the services and products provided by NRG and would wholeheartedly recommend them to family and friends!</Text>< Pics>

I spoke with Herald who tried to ramrod a cookie cutter solar pitch down my throat, not the virtual net metering setup I know we need to have that our city and utility provider supports.  Not only would he not answer my questions, but he also demanded I provide actual utility bills, not just energy consumption figures so he could show me how much we'd save.  When I told him I can calculate that on my own, I just need cost estimates, that is when he insulted me and said I couldn't do basic accounting.

His unprofessional behavior during our call shocked me; it's the worst I've ever encountered especially being a hot lead with a larger solar job.    I would strongly advise avoiding such horrible sales service.< /review>< Pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>NRG installed a new energy-efficient asphalt roof and a 30-panel 13 kWh system on our house, including a major sub-panel upgrade.  The sales process was interactive and not hard-sell in any way.  The design and permitting went fairly smoothly (Oakland is notoriously slow).  Once we were ready to go, we were helped enormously by Leila, a very competent project manager on NRG's team.  The roofers (subcontracted to Greentech) were efficient and easy to work with.  Once they were done, we had a problem with a gutter overflowing, and it turned out they had not cleaned out the downspouts.  They returned to fix this problem, so it all worked out.  The panel installation also went well, although it took a few visits over a couple of weeks to complete the project.  I was impressed that they painted all the conduit to blend in with the roof and the cedar shingles on our house.  Only one minor SNAFU: a chip in one of our double pain windows had to be repaired, but they covered the cost with a gift card.

Overall, we had a great experience with NRG and I would recommend them without hesitation.  If you can, ask for Chris in Sales, Miguel for installation and electrical hookup, and Leila for excellent and personable project management.<//text><GmapID>0x80c29c16766710ed:0xe696d7b2b95f8b89<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I am so surprised to see that you have such a professional staff, who helped me with the paperwork and explaining everything. Your company is super professional! All the guys who worked on my house were so pleasant and polite. They always cleaned up everything and left my house nice and neat. After the solar was installed, Daniel followed up with me and set up an app so that I can check my solar system whenever I want.  I cant' wait to see my next LADWP bill. I am sure my electric bill will be "0". So exciting! Oren, if I could give you a 10 star, I would give it to you. You are so good, that my neighbor already hired you as well.

NRG just completed our Quaker Meeting's solar project.  While somewhat delayed due to COVID (what hasn't been), NRG gave us a very competitive bid, answered all of our questions throughout the process, handled the permitting process, was *very* responsive to any of our concerns, and provided excellent project management and service.   After one glitch, they quickly and effectively fixed it and more than made up for it.  From the initial query through Energy Sage to the educational run through on how to monitor the panels, we are very very satisfied.   We would recommend them to anyone.</Review>

Tiffany was great. The guys were out right away to begin the project and installed my new heater and air conditioner for me within weeks.I had some other construction going on and asked Tiffany to slow the crew down a couple of weeks to which she cheerfully did for me. They coordinated and filed everything with the city and SCE which was very helpful since I didn't know the process. One of the workers asked me if I had any house paint and even painted the conduit for me so it matched the house. I was so satisfied that I even referred a friend to which I was rewarded a referral fee. These guys are great and Tiffany made it all happen on schedule.</Review>

For the most part the install went well from initial contact to system turn on. There was some miscommunication regarding one of the add-ons. The wrong add-on was installed and it took 3+ months to get it sorted out. There is still some material sitting in my backyard that needs to be picked up, but I have not received a confirmation about when it will be picked up.  Hopefully they will pick it up soon.</text>

We used NRG Clean Power to install solar panels on our office building in Chatsworth. We had heavy machinery that was costing us over $2,000 per month in electricity with The department of water and power. We are now paying around $400 per month. This was really a great deal for us and we should be paying off the solar panels within 3 years.

The installation process took a bit longer than expected but mostly due to the backlog at the city with COVID keeping all the city workers at home. The permit took 4 months to get through and the install itself was 1 week.

We are very happy and look forward to not paying $2,000 per month! Thank you guys.<//Text>

<Text>When we started thinking about having solar installed in at our home, we we unsure of which company to use. After meeting with Kelly Taylor, we knew we found the right company. She was so knowledgeable, honest and genuinely wanted to make sure that the system we got would work for our home and family. During all of this the stay-at-home orders were issued and Tiffany Swisa really did an outstanding job of keeping us informed, scheduling installations, inspections, and getting our system up and running. Both Kelly and Tiffany went above and beyond to make sure that all even if these crazy times where so much is unknown, we were happy and got the best experience possible. Thank you both so much!</Text>< Time>

My mom doesn't have a computer so I am writing this for her. Tiffany always followed up with me in every step of the project. Permits and inspections came back in a good timely manner. Our  sales rep Kelly was very knowledgeable and personable, very easy to understand and work with. Installation was excellent and I was very impressed that they installed 16 panels in 2 hours. Installation team was very polite. I would recommend others to NRG.< /text>

Kelly was great, she came over and discussed the benefits of going solar. The whole process was patient enough to get what you want. Sales process was easy and not pushy. Installation was quick and efficient. Panels were on the roof in one day, amazing. Respected the property and cleaned up after themselves. Jake was friendly and answered all my questions. Robert came out to my best convenience and showed me how everything works. Set up the solar edge app on my phone so I can view the production levels. Robert did excellent tutorial on his behalf. Solar edge app is very simple and straight forward. Really like that you can see every solar production. Would Recommend.</text>

< review>
i just wanted to thank Sherry for all her help making sure that our project was taken care of from beginning to end.
My husband and I have been wanting to move forward with solar for so long, but we never found a company we were comfortable enough with until NRG..
Leo our sales guy made us feel so at ease with the whole project.
We ended up installing our Roof with NRG clean power, along with the solar and we couldnt be happier. Thank you to the whole team for making this experience A+ from the very beginning !<//review>

<Review>Recently I’ve been in the market for solar and I was told to look into the company NRG Clean Power. Nicole was my project coordinator and she killed it! Everything went smoothly; she answered all of my questions, helped me with the permitting process, and was very friendly. I highly recommend going with NRG Clean Power if you are in the market for solar.</Review>< date>

What a wonderful experience.  So much easier that we anticipated.  Kelly Taylor was our energy consultant and proved to be a very, very knowledgeable and answered all of our question.  She has been very accommodating  and caring in working with us. She often checked in with to see how we were doing.  Sherry was our coordinator with the crew and made sure that we had a timeline for installation that a fit our schedule.  That all weren't very smoothly.  She was a delight to work with and very responsive.. Robert was so patient with us, making sure that we understand how our system works.  He took us step by step explaining all about the inverter, what to do in case of emergency, etc. Then Robert helped us get started with the monitoring platform, again explaining all the information at our fingertips, including how to download the mobile app.  I would not hesitate to recommend NRG Clean Power to family and friends.  They are excellent to work with!  We know that they will there for us in the future to answer all our energy needs.  GREAT JOB!!< /Text>

<Review>Daniel was nice, informative and knowledgeable. He explained the positive benefits of going solar and honestly the product sold it self. Everything made sense from point A to point B. Installation went smooth and quick. Installed 13 panels on my roof and the look fantastic. The coordination with Tiffany was very professional and she got things done and handled in a timely manner. At the end NRG sent out Robert who worked with my scheduled to set an appointment to turn on my solar along with overlooking the techs work and app. Everyone at NRG is great and honest I can see why they have been in business for a long time. I would gladly do business again with them.</Review><rating>5</rating><GmapID>0x80c29c16766710ed:0xe696d7b2b95f8b89< /GmapID>< pics>

<Text>Kelly was a good sales rep. She explained thoroughly about the cost and the process of the job. She was great to deal with and very friendly and approachable. And most definitely knowledgeable about the business. Installers explained every step that they did on the house. The respected the property and cleaned up after themselves. The solar panels look great on the roof. The installation was done in about a six hour period.  Alexis was helpful throughout the process. Robert came out to explain the solar edge and also the online monitoring system. Solar Edge is really user friendly, and is more detailed than my current Sun Power inverter. Referral program is rewarding and I am on the process of referring a couple of my friends. Great company overall.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Time>1548267944951</Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>Harold was clear and got straight to the point on what needs to be said. Explained the benefits of going solar and how it can help lowering my electricity bill. Harold offered a great financing program to get us started and it was a benefit to our house hold. Installers got the panels on the roof faster than expected. Everything was cleaned up and it was not as noisy as I thought. Took about 3 hours to get 15 panels on my roof. I cannot believe how fast and efficient the installers were. I like the fact NRG does everything in-house, from the installers to the salesman and the project coordinators. Makes everything smooth and fast. Also a plus that they are a LA based Company. Going to refer NRG to my friends and family without a doubt. Amazing Business.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>From Reece, Tiffany, Robert, installers and everyone else who helped with our solar project big thanks to you guys. We been wanting to do solar for awhile and finally got the chance to pull forward with the idea. We got 12 solar panels from Solar World with a 3.48kw system. Everything went smooth from the installation to getting the permits and everything approved. NRG has great customer service and after support. I will most likely use this company again. Keep up the great work!</text><username>Katie Munoz< /username></record></dataset><record>

Daniel was very knowledgeable and polite. Tiffany was my project coordinator and she did a wonderful job coordinating the project. She always kept me on the loop and responds to emails really quick. Installers came in and out and finished putting 13 panels in about 5 hours. Cleaned up everything and most importantly dog friendly. Panels look great on the roof and installers also paint matched the wiring so everything looks nice and discreet. Thanks for the tutorial from Robert. Solar edge app is very easy to use and understand. Very informative software that explains your solar production and also how you can manage electricity. I will be able to compare my bills using this helpful app. Everything from point A to Z went just as planned, thank you NRG.< /review>

<Text>Daniel was well-spoken and explained the benefits of going solar. Daniel provided a lot of perks with my solar package and was the main reason why I picked NRG Clean Power. He went the extra mile just to negotiate the best package he can offer. Daniel also made sure that the panels were warrantied. Jake was very prompt in following up with every detail of the project. He was very responsive and always got back to me via email. Installers came during my work hours and when I got home panels were already on the house. Cleaned up after themselves and respected property. Installing 14 panels was done in one day on a 2nd story home. It is nice that NRG sends out Robert who is my quality control rep who came and showed me how the system works. Explains in detail how the solar edge app functions and what to look for in case of any faulty signs. Robert is very knowledgeable on what he says and it is nice to get after support when project is completed.<//Text><user>101215450521568693091</user><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

<Text>Kelly was very knowledgeable, and was not a pushy sales person. She was open to different options and alternative with suggestions about what panels work best for my house. Installation was excellent, and quick, in and out in a couple hours. Tiffany was informative and supportive. She made the solar process an ease and delivered by the promise date. Robert gave an excellent presentation on how the solar works. Showed me how to turn off and on the solar panels and also use the solar edge. Overall great value and service from NRG Clean Power.</Text>< Time>

<Review>Leo was fantastic salesman. He answered all my questions and comforted me. Jeff along with Leo solidify my comfort and erased my doubts on solar. No sales pressure what so ever. Tiffany was exceptional. She walk me through step by step what to expect and answered my questions above and beyond. Installers are good guys, they were professional. They came, did their job and was in and out in two days. After the installation is done, NRG sent out Robert to inspect the system one last time and also give me a excellent tutorial. He is very knowledgeable in what he does and really provides good advice on saving money with the solar.</Review>< pictures>

Leo was personable and was informative and answered all my questions to my satisfaction. Installation was very fast. Did not need to be home during the installation, came home and it was done. Tiffany always kept me informed on all the tasks that needed to be done. Tiffany was prompt and professional. Robert came out after everything was done to thoroughly explain how everything works. He was very knowledgeable. Highly recommend.<//Review>

<text>I got solar because I was tired of high electric bills, and SDGE does not get cheaper every year. Kelly gave me a very good pricing on the solar and she was informative and answered all my questions. She even gave me more answers than I needed which was very beneficial. Installation was very quick, I did not need to be home while the project was installed. The finished product was top notch. I was very interested in the solar app because it very important to see the levels of productivity. Solar edge app is really simple and very useful tool to monitor. The app isn't too much nor isn't to little. Robert came out and was very flexible with my schedule. Gave me a detailed walk through how to operate, shut down, and look for things that go wrong. Appointment was useful and informative. He was the cherry on top of the cake. I would highly recommend NRG to my friends and family.</text></record></dataset><record>

Initially I was quite pleased with NRG, but as the project progressed, it appeared as though there was a significant disconnect within the company's communication pathways. There were unnecessary delays caused by the NRG using old and outdated forms that were submitted to Edison for compliance and inspection. This required me to be present not once, but twice, which cut into my work schedule. Between project design delays and installation delays and the inspection delays, it put the job 2 months behind the target date. I made several calls into NRG but never got the problems handled in a timely manner, hence the 2 month delay in getting solar hooked up and running!
Since then, we had a very wet winter and I had a roof leak, not knowing if it was due to NRG's work or not. I called my own roofer, who on inspection, found left over parts and supplies from NRG that were left on the roof, causing water to dam and pool. He removed the parts to allow the water to flow. I called NRG to notify them and asked them if they would repair the interior dry wall damage, resulting from their crew leaving items on the roof. They declined, saying that there's no proof that it was due to their negligence, as my roofer removed the items causing the initial water pooling. They demanded pictures from the roofer to prove that items were left on the roof, and a signed letter from him, stating that he removed the items, and to provide his contractor license number. They further stated that most people lack honesty and that they have to protect themselves from such customers.

I have been a homeowner for 34 years, having completed 2 major remodels, and am a CPA formerly auditing both small and large businesses. I have never experienced a business questioning my veracity, nor a company that would not at the very least send out a tech to inspect the leak. The damages were $200. The install was $26,000. No matter what I said to the manager, I was rebuked. I then decided to post this review.

Since then, I received a call from the Operations Manager stating that it is company policy not to service customers who have posted a negative review, but assured me the repair would be done if I pulled the review.

No matter how happy I am that I went solar, I am highly disappointed in a company that lacks integrity to this degree. In my opinion, it's a poor choice not to remedy such a small repair for such a large installation. It's also not in their best interest to doubt customers without reason, nor to try to bribe them to remove a review.
Customers don't always remember the product, but they will always remember the service they received, or didn't.< /text>

<Review>Me and my husband have been in search of the right company to help us transfer to solar power and I can’t believe we finally found it! NRG has just the team and knowledge to help you with any of your solar needs. We were helped to by Nicole and I cannot put my gratitude into words.
Not only was Nicole punctual, polite and friendly while helping us transfer to solar. She radiated positivity and true care for us as customers. The process was done quick and they managed to work around my busy schedule. From planning to installing, I couldn’t be happier with how this turned out. Definitely recommend anyone planning on going solar to take their business to NGR! Great team and great work!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

You can literally watch your meter go backwards and know that you are saving yourself a lot of $$$. NRG did a fantastic job on installing my system. NRG's project management team walked me through the installation process. The project coordinator (Idan) explained every detail regarding how the system works and how to monitor its productivity. He is great to work with and is very responsive to his customers. I've researched a lot of solar companies, NRG is by far the best in the industry. I'm going to use NRG again for my rental properties!!<//review>< Pics>

<text>We came into contact with NRG Clean Power a few months ago, immediately after moving into our new home in CA.  We were very interested in solar and it didn't take long to convince us this was the company for us.
The entire process went smoothly.  Our awesome sales rep, Gary, helped us choose the package that would be right for us.  The installation team was really great as well.  They are quick and well-organized. The financing has made our decision to go solar very easy. And so far we are extremely pleased with the coverage we're receiving.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Robert was well spoken over the phone. Explained everything about the solar panels inside and out. Always kept wanting to make sure if I understood everything and if I did not he would go over it again. I can tell from that, he truly cares and does not seem like he is trying to rush out of the conversation. Glad I went solar and picked NRG for the services.</Text>

Ryan is a solar expert. He spent 2 hours with me going over all the necessary steps I need to upgrade me home that I've been delaying for almost 10 years. The good thing is I did not have to find multiple companies to do the work. Just finished and the outcome is beautiful. I would highly recommend Ryan and of course Sherry that helped me for 2 months.< /Text>

Quick and fast install, and informative. Everyone at the NRG were knowledgeable and helped the install process go smoothly. Tiffany made sure I was informed and happy through the entire process!  Thank you NRG!<//review>

<Review>Our  sales rep Kelly was very knowledgeable and personable, very easy to understand and work with. Installation was excellent and I was very impressed that they installed 16 panels in 2 hours. Installation team was very polite. Tiffany always followed up with me in every step of the project. Permits and inspections came back in a good timely manner. Quality assurance appointment was excellent and learned valuable information about my system. I would recommend others for NRG.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c29c16766710ed:0xe696d7b2b95f8b89<//gmapID></record>

Reece was good salesman, very professional. Spent a lot of time explaining the benefits of going solar. Easy and simple, we did not feel pressured to buy anything. Tiffany answered all my questions and concerns. Always got back to me whenever I called. Installation team did exceptional work. They were in and out very fast, picked up after themselves, and made sure everything was installed accordingly.  Robert came out to service our solar panels and made sure things were operating how they should be. Solar Edge monitoring seems very user friendly. Great work from everybody.<//Text>

Reece saved me over $4,000.00 on my Solar. We were able to put that savings into a new roof with a little left over for a panel upgrade. If you need Solar but are not sure you can afford it, call Reece from NRG.</Text>

I had done some research on solar panels and we choose NRG Clean Power because of the superior panels and warranty. What they offer is a cut above the industry standard.  The person whom we coordinated, Ms. Sherry is who we trusted to help us navigate such a huge investment. Every step of the process was clearly communicated and expedited from every member of the NRG Clean Power Team.  Miguel the engineer rocks!  We have referred all our friends and anyone who will listen. We are delighted about going Solar and what it means for the earth and our pockets.< /Review>

<Review>Katelyn Morgan was helping me make decisions on my solar needs. It was between NRG and Solar Max. I chose NRG because warranty and the cost was competitive. I was searching for companies that have been around for 10 years. Tiffany was excellent at coordinating, she was very quick to respond. Handled the HOA approval, city permits and install schedule. She was very quick to respond to email and always kept me informed. I was not home during the installation but it was done under half a day to install 12 panels on a single story home on spanish style roof. Installers cleaned up after themselves when project was completed, as if they were not here. Robert came over and answered my questions about the inverter and also what to faulty issues to look for in case things happen. Conveniently worked on my schedule so that was also a plus. Keep up the good work NRG!!</Review>< Pics>

Extremely smooth process.  Thank You to Sherry and Denise for their professionalism and friendly help/guidance during the process.  They were always ready to take my calls and help immediately with any questions.  True customer service.

Also, a big thank you to the installers.  Quick and efficient and barely new they were here.

Again, Thank You.

My experience with NRG was great including the installation and the way everything was coordinated. I plan on referring more people to go solar.</review>

<Text>NRG Clean Power installed my solar system 6/2017.did a good job, however 17 months later three of my panels are only producing 1/3 the power the of the rest of my panels.  I have been trying the talk to a live person for 2 weeks.....no return calls, when they transfer the call I only get voice mail....they forget you after the installation, won't return your calls.  Very poor service.  I was told that they moniter your system and will notify you of any problems....not true!<//Text>< name>

He went above and beyond to making sure I was satisfied. Tiffany was very professional and kept me updated on what to do next. Robert came in a timely manner, answered all my questions.

<text>I recently had a 10.8kW solar panel installed on my house by NRG Clean Power.  While everyone at the company, from sales to installation and post-installation walk-through was great, the ‘ace’ of the team clearly has been Tiffany Swisa.  She not only is warm and friendly, making the necessary communication enjoyable and stress-free, but she has a fantastic grasp of the entire series of steps involved.  She, therefore, is able to stay on top of all the steps and coordinate the different activities beginning with the initial site visit, to the engineer’s projections, the approvals required, the installer’s schedules, the city inspection and the final walk-through.  If not for Tiffany, all of this might seem daunting to anyone who has never done it before, but she makes it all occur effortlessly and on time.  Even more impressive, she somehow seems to make herself available if any uncertainties occur and is always ready and able to answer any questions that might arise. In this day and age of automation and ‘impersonal customer service’, having Tiffany available to answer questions, coordinate activities and assure things continue to run smoothly and on-schedule proved to be an unexpected and welcomed advantage to selecting NRG to install our panels.  I recommend NRG, and Tiffany, with the greatest enthusiasm and confidence possible.</text>< Pictures>

The reviews are spot on. I got quotes from various companies and the price beats the competition. The system designed for my new home was well explain. Every performance point was discussed on its pros and cons which made it a well understood system. The system walk thru with Denise also helped me understand how to work and operate my system.  No complaints so far only great things!< /Text>

Savings savings savings if your spending as much money as I do on utilities this company will give you savings. The team here is very knowledgeable and was so patient with my questions. The financing can save you instead of paying a big lumpsumb upfront. Highly recommend them for insulation, roof, and solar.< /Text>

<text>Great service! We recently used NRG to install solar and  some new HVAC units.  Could not find a lot of solar companies that do both solar and other energy efficient upgrades but did get full quotes from two companies found.  Our sales person was very informative and gave us many options that in the end we feel we believe was a great business plan that should pay itself off within 3 years. Tiffany was great to work with - she kept us very informed and ran the project smoothly. We had a time line of fishing by the end of the year to take advantage of the tax credits and they pulled it off way early - all done in 1 month.  So far so good and we feel confident we made the right choice with NRG. Thank you!</text>< Time>

Enjoying my system for almost 6 months now. No issues thus far. Knock on wood. Will update my review if something bad happens.

From the start to finish service was outstanding. Tiffany was professional and communicated well. We truly delight in their work decency. Unlike some other solar companies, which are mostly sales people; John sat down to explain all the technical issues to help me choose the right system and size. Further more he explained how to properly maintain the system.</text>

< Review>
My wife was very firm with using nrg for our solar and roof repair and boy I am glad I listened to her. Alexis and Lisa were a pleasure to work with. Clean work, good pricing, and we also received credit incentives. I wish I can give them 100 stars. Thank you.< /Review>

My experience with nrg was smooth sailing from start to finish. Tiffany is a great project coordinator. She was really thorough on the process and made sure to keep me and my husband in the loop. The city took a bit long to get the permit but that was not their fault. I'm so happy I chose this company!</Review>

The reason I'm writing the review is because I get to see how they operate and how they respect and treat their customers well. Unlike others, they won't push services onto people that don't need it or can't afford it. The management really cares for the employees too.

I loved the seemless process. Tiffany Swiss @NRG Clean Power was awesome!
Best customer service. From beginning to installation etc, it was easy from a consumers perspective. She walked me through the entire thing and is always available to help with any questions. Tiffany made the whole thing stressfree and responds to email promptly.

Super happy with my new solar system.
Thank you
Tiffany

< review>
From experience I have learned that many people contact organizations and companies to complain about the service or products they have received, I am not that person. I want to let as many people know that I can that my experience with NRG, more specifically Tiffany Swiss is and continues to be one of the most enjoyable, professional and greatest experiences I can remember in many years. I am well over 50 years old and I come from a generation where the customer was mainly the focus and it is truly refreshing to say that she personifies all those qualities.
I have not had such an awesome company representative in years. She goes out of her way to make certain that I satisfied; she speaks with such a level of respect and courtesy that every conversation is a pure joy. I am hoping there some way that this can reach the highest levels of the company to let them know that she is above reproach, and outstanding employee and an all-around beautiful person. I will highly recommend Tiffany specifically to anyone I refer or engage about my experience with NRG. Thank you from my heart Tiffany!!!

Very respectfully,
Rev. Dr. Jerry C. Moore Sr.< /review>

This is a great company. I interviewed several companies and I am very satisfied w/ the decision to have a  contract with NRG Clean Power. Everyone I came in contact w/ was extremely professional and pleasant. Idan is my main contact. My system is collecting above the estimated amount.My monitoring is running smoothly and Idan is still in touch. I feel this is a company that stands behind their product. Thanks much.< /Review>

I had a great experience working with NRG Clean Power to install my solar system. Tiffany was my project manager and she kept every step of the installation moving along smoothly. I highly recommend this company -- every single person I interacted with, from the initial meeting, the contractors, the installers, was professional and knowledgeable.<//Review>

This is the 2nd house we have installed solar at and I wish we would have known About NRG then! All aspects have been above expectation. Daniel was our sales rep who is courteous, knowledge and NoT pushy.
Our project coordinator is beyond amazing! Tiffany S. is efficient, effective, quick and super nice. She is always sweet, even with annoying little calls I had. She is on her game and you can hear her do it with a smile!< /review>

I just had NRG Clean Power install a 27 panel solar system on my shake roof in San Jose.  They did a great job and the system works perfectly.  There is even a smart phone app that let's you monitor and track your power generation.  I'm looking forward to reducing my PG&E electrical bill from ~$500/month to $0/month.  The system will pay for itself in about 7 years!

If you are interested in a residential solar system, I highly recommend NRG Clean Power ,,, but ask to have Tiffany as your project manager -- she is the greatest -- she oversaw the project from start to finish and made sure everything was done just right.  Thank you Tiffany!!< /text>

I had a solar system for about a year, works ok but their work quality not the greatest, they ruined my roof, the workers DO NOT CARE for your roof, if anyone ever needs o wants a solar system make sure the installers know how to work on roofs, these people are careless, they make holes all over and worse than that when they patch them they do a poor job.. not a good company..</text>

<Review>Kelly and the entire team at NRG were simply amazing.
I signed the contract very late (first week of November) but urged them to try and meet the Dec 1st 2017 deadline (SDGE rate change). I was not very hopeful as other companies were quoting timelines of 2 months or so, but NRG installed and secured the permits in a matter of less than a week and I got my PTO several days before the deadline.

I was completely at awe at how they pulled it off.

Also their customer service was excellent. Tiffany was the one who worked with me from the office regarding permits, paperwork etc. and she was very professional and responsive.
Their team also walked me through the operation of the system including the monitoring app and what various things mean on the Inverter's UI.
I couldn't have been more happier. I referred them to many of my friends and will continue to do so.<//Review>< Rate>

<Name>L8n Klly<//Name>< Review>
I am impressed and thankful I chose nrg clean power to install solar for me. Tiffany was my project coordinator and was there for me throughout my entire solar project. I must say what I loved about this company was that you have one person that is there with you every step of the way. It has now been 3 months and my electricity bill is so close to zero and sometimes I even get a credit to my grid! Nrg also helped me with financing so I dont have to pay so much money in one shot. I was eligible for a 12 month program where I don’t have to pay anything for almost a year. Talk about a deal! I would like to extend a thank you to Tiffany, Lisa, Leo, Eric and the entire crew that made this possible.<//Review>

<Review>I had nrg clean power  install my solar panels on our home in san diego. They also put in a car charger for my nissan leaf. The sales rep was pleasant and their office staff was great. They have good financing options and they use quality panels.< /Review>< pictures>

When spending so much money on a system you want to make sure you go with the right company. I received 3 bids and although NRG was not the cheapest what they offer is the cherry on top of the cake. They offered us American made panels at a discounted rate... people no china products here! After Daniel gave us an estimate and explained the system to us he offered us.... wait for it.... 12 months no payment for financing. YUPPPP 1 year. When we got approved it was a no brainer to go with NRG. Sherry contacted me and was there from the start to the end of my project. The finance department also walked me thru my tax credit and helped me fill out the form... Talk about excellent customer service. Now that my system is up and running I am paying close to nothing. Can't complain here.<//Review>

<Review>Excellent food and service. Don't mind that it is a little "rough around the edges" in outside appearance.

<Review>Ordered a carnita burrito. Could have been less satisfied, but I nearly finished the plate. Saw mostly mechanics come in, explaining the popularity. Its more a lunch stop type of restaurant. The beans and rice were delicious. The horchata could've been served with more ice as it was lukewarm.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>I give them up to 2 stars because they had good service. However the food was terrible. I ordered a steak which when it came was the lowest quality cut of meat I’ve ever had before and was cooked improperly. I’m not sure about the other dishes however this particular one was overpriced. They seemed to be very please with the dish as well which makes me wonder about the other dishes there. Was VERY disappointed< /Review>< pictures>

Tgis place use to be good. I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada......😣. First of all it was 12 dollars. Which made expectations high, then , they bring me a 7dollar tostada in size ...😢.....and then to top it off its only a pico de gallo with bits of "small" "boiled" shrimp.  Instead of cucumber they put lettuce....nugh said<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Wow. This place is AMAZING. So this morning the owners came by to my job to drop off menus & politely informed us about their restaurant & also let us know they delivered. The items on the menu sounded so good so myself & 4 other coworkers placed an order for delivery & the owners delivered it to the store and let me just say...GREAT SERVICE GREAT PACKING GREAT DELIVERY GREAT FOOD. They did not miss anything, they made sure we had everything we needed for our delivery. Not disappointed one bit. Highly recommend La Cascada. Thank you guys!! :) oh also another great thing about this restaurant..the prices are just right!!!! :)<//review>< pics>

Good quality food in an odd location. The store front doesn't look too appealing, but give it a shot. The waitress in the morning is always prompt and kind. Good is of good, authentic quality.</Text>

<Review>The food hasn't changed in the last 30 years.  New items get added, but the same standards are still there.  IMO the best huevos con chorizo in the state. Freshly made to order corn tortillas. Not fancy by any means, but good tasting plain old Mexican food.  The chips are terrible, but the salsa is good.  The hot version, not the gringo one.<//Review><rate>5< /rate>< Resp>

Don't pay attention to the outside.  The food is delicious!  I will come again and again when we are in the neighborhood.  Great authentic food with fresh homemade tortillas.</Text>

<Text>This is the second time I have been able to visit this establishment and thus far I have enjoyed both visits.  The wait staff is both cordial as well as attentive.  Food is fresh and presented well with plentiful portions.  In a location with few choices this is a gem in the woods. Bon Appetit<//Text>< Pics>

“Ate here for 2nd time in 3 day trip!”
Went with family - 2nd time for me to an In-N-Out in 3 days. These places rock if you want a great burger and fries. If you're a big eater, get two double-doubles and fries. You will not be disappointed! Service is quick and food is excellent! Best burgers around!< /Text>

<text>This is a regular stop for me almost every time I am in Fontana which seems to be fairly often.  The food is always consistently good.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.   This is a casual place and not at all pretentious.  If in the area I encourage you to give them a try.  Bon Appetit !<//text>< pics>

<review>“Good Carnitas and Beans ”

The best food hands down in Fontana, Owners are Fabulous, there a waitress named Mariela she gives good service the only drawback is that they need to upgrade their jukebox from 100 B.C and get a internet jukebox< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Mexican food is delicious, and here in La Cascada they keep that delicious flavor. Today we try Enchiladas de Mole red with its rice and beans, also Milanesa de res, very tasty accompanied by potato salad, mmmmh tasty. The attention of the Host Lupita is excellent, it is always clean. Oh and if you want fried Mojarra, this is the ideal place. F

<resp>None</resp><review>(Translated by Google) WORST food I have ever had in Fontana. , I did not like it. I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce, they overcooked and seemed breaded with garlic salt. They only put salt with garlic on top with lumps, very bad, it seems that the lid fell off. I only ate two, removing the lumps but I can't take it anymore and I was very hungry, the frozen potato puree taken out of the refrigerator, the rice just as cold !! Stop the cold I heard from several days. My daughter's burger had burned meat and the potatoes had the oil with a weird flavor. Also bad and the bathroom needs cleaning. I will definitely NOT RETURN and in truth, I am not a special person with food, it makes me ugly to waste and I try to eat even though I don't like it so much, it is the first time I have left a full plate in a real restaurant, everything was very wrong.

(Original)
La PEOR comida que he probado en Fontana. , no me gusto ,.ordene camarones almojo de ajo, se les paso la cocción y parecian empanizados de sal con ajo,. Solo le pusieron sal con ajo encima con grumos,,.muy mal, pareciera que se les cayo la tapa,. solo me comi dos quitandoles los grumos pero no puede mas y eso que llevaba mucha hambre, el pure de papa helado sacado de el refrigerador, el arroz igual frio!! Deja de lo frio me supo de varios dias,.  Las hamburguesa de mi hija la carne quemada y las papas el aceite con un sabor raro,. Tambien malo y necesita limpieza el baño,. Definitivamente NO REGRESARE y en verdad ,no soy una persona especial con la comida, se me hace feo desperdiciar y trato de comer aunque no me agrade tanto ,.es la primera ves que dejo un plato completo en un restaurant de verdad, todo estaba muy mal.<//review><Rate>1</Rate><Time>1540259579898<//Time>< user_id>

-La Lune Sucree aka The Sweet Moon is a great place to grab some breakfast.
-The little outdoor patio parallel to the Paseo de San Antonio makes for a picture perfect scene reminiscent your favorite "arrondissement" in Paris.
-Now to the food, if you like crepes theres plenty choices here.
-Their avocado toast is delicious along w/ their Breakfast Bendict.
-They also love dogs here & while we were dining they offered to give our dog some chicken..how awesome is that!

Overall, this a nice taste of France right here in DTSJ (Downtown San Jose)!<//text>< pics>

I want to start this off by saying that the person working was so nice and was lovely. But that being said we got almost nothing for the $20 we spent on some crepes and a sandwich. Very disappointed.< /review>

It's not terribly welcoming, but it's a good option if you prefer a cleaner looking environment to the Philz to it's left. The coffee isn't bad, and the food looks good, although I haven't tried it yet. It's a good option if you're in a hurry for a coffee. The chairs could benefit from those little pads on the bottom of the legs to make them not screech as they cross the tile.<//text>

< review>
This is our go-to spot on the weekend for brunch/lunch, and one of the few places downtown we have been to numerous times. We don't like to wait in line forever for bad brunch food, and this is the perfect antidote. The service can be, at times, rather French (i.e. you'll wait for the food) -- but it is friendly and always worth the wait.</review>

I visited here for a Saturday brunch. Nice European-style bakery.

PRO: I had Moon over Norway (ham, poached egg, cheese, etc) and the stuff inside the crepe was EXCELLENT. Poached eggs were so good and just the overall flavor was great. Nice patio. Chocolate macaroon (the coconut flake thing, not the colourful mini-burger looking thing) was good. Almont croissant was good... like 7.5~8 out of 10.

CON: The actual crepes. They were hard, rubbery, difficult to cut, and too chewy. I thought they were more like the Chinese scallion pancakes, but even tougher. Service felt a bit on the slow side.

I give it 3 stars plus 1 more star for the excellent crepe filling.<//Text>

< Review>
If you are an establishment that promotes yourself as a cafe selling coffee (a diuretic) with ample seating, but you do not have the capacity for a patron restroom, then you should probably reconsider your business choice. In addition to this deal-breaker, the lattes are very mediocre, the seats are uncomfortable and cheap, the decor (or lack thereof) is not cohesive making it difficult to determine what kind of restaurant this is, and finally the wifi does not work on laptops - I had to use Philz next door. Skip this confusing experience if you can avoid it.</Review>

As I replied to your review in other review site, i feel really bad about this situation as well. philz / gongcha and my shop Doesnt have restroom but we are not supposed to offer restroom due to building policy. Wifi parts might need to accept privacy policy on our website after accepting signal so it might be a bit confusing or it might have temporary disconnect at that moment I am really sorry about that all happened at the same time. We will do our best to explain wifi connection with customer next time if there is any! We are deeply sorry about this again.'}<//Resp>

Love this little jewel.  From their tasty breakfast benedict to chicken aioli sandwich to their housemade buttery and super flakey croissants and other pastries, this place rocks...</Review>

<userid>118281768356459340469< /userid><text>I used to LOVE this place! And was excited when they re-opened. I don't know if it has to do with new ownership, but the food was not the same in terms of quality. I ordered their avocado TOAST with a POACHED egg on top. I even asked the cashier if the yolk would be runny, and she said yes. I got my toast.... which turned out to be a sandwich. Two pieces of wheat, sliced bread, hardly toasted, smooshed together with hardly mashed avocado and a HARD-BOILED egg that was cold and cooked all the way through in between. When I said something about it, she took it back, and brought it back out saying, "...we found one." What? They replaced it with a softer, but still cooked through, hard boiled egg... in sandwich form still. I'm not one to leave reviews or complain about food, but I was so disappointed. Especially because I used to LOVE coming to eat here. And how do you mess up avocado toast??< /text><gmapID>0x808fccbbd4394103:0x981e3df4fc697d68< /gmapID></record>

However, The missing star because we had to wait for 15 min for a Nutella crepe, but we understood that because the man who was before us order took them a long time to prepare.</Review>< userid>

Small and charming neighborhood shop.  Good tasting pastries and sandwiches, albeit a little on the pricey side (not a random statement, but in contrast to other patisseries, such as Alexander's and Bouchon's).

Friendly staff, slow service...very slow.  Coffee is ok (better to go next door to Philz for java.... I've seen one of the owner's do the same).  Accepts mobile payment.

I'll return, but maybe not so often.<//review>

<Text>The "Salmon" sandwich is actually lox, and quite good. Some of the beers are *very* expensive, but I think they have some beers you can't find easily elsewhere. Some of the chairs are *very* uncomfortable, and I'd like to think that's not on purpose - seem designed to get you out of there ASAP.</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Hey! I'm from Canada, and under 13, I guess, I wanna be an actor there and I could travel and you could make your own event called: Kids Make Shows Event! and I will be an actor and a show creator, if you make the event, and, that's all.

I love this channel! I search every century of your YouTube channel but I can't find Taiwan. Can you release Nickelodeon Taiwan? I don't understand English because I am China.< /review>

Never been too deep inside the vowels of this place, but their lobby area is gorgeous! I too Mr. Johnny Rotten and John Rambo there for a voice-over gig once about a year-and-a-half ago. Everybody there seem eager to be nice and help me when I was in the facilities. I don't think just anyone is able to go inside the place, even as far as the lobby only, so I'm happy to have visited the very place in those couple occasions.< /review>

Then out of my dim and exhausted consciousness I heard music and I became aware that this music had been playing for sometime, somewhere in my background, but it was live and it had lifted my mood and somehow made my day. So I got up and grabbed my camera, because now I was determined find out where this wonderful rock and roll music was coming from; little did I know it was only a few steps away. Now this is a phenomenal that happens to me all the time out here in Burbank. There Are Places landmarks like to Disneyland Warner Brothers and now the Nickelodeon right under my nose all this time and I didn't know it until I heard the music. I heard something, then I saw something, to and it caused me to feel something. Joy in my heart and soul...thank you...God Bless. Now I'm going to take us out with more of this music...good night.< /Review>< pics>

Fun environment with high morale all around. Very clean campus, nostalgic decoration, and top security. Visitors typically only allowed on the first floor unless invited upstairs. Be prepared to spend a little money at the café if you stick around for lunch; the menu changes every day.</text>

I've experienced nicktoons in my life: SpongeBob squarepants, rugrats, the wild thornberrys, Jimmy neutron, the fairly oddparents but especially the loud House! In France, there are a few nicktoons which are available on gulli. After rugrats and the wild thornberrys with "rugrats go wild" as well as Timmy Turner and Jimmy neutron with "Jimmy Timmy power hour," I would like there is a cross between SpongeBob squarepants and the loud House, it could name "the sponge House" or "spongeloud squarehouse!" What do you think? In any case, a very big thank you to Nickelodeon for its animations that we love and that we would like in the coming years!< /review>
