I worked with Kaleo at Classic Rock and it was nothing but a pleasure.  I came in early November with plans on surprising my now fiancee by proposing on our anniversary which is around Christmas time.  I also needed someone who would be willing to work with a center diamond that was already in the family.  Kaleo was super supportive and helped make this custom ring a real stunner.  I gave him pictures of rings from my fiancee's pintrest and he found the perfect one!< /review>

Contacted Classic Rock to make a custom wedding ring after reading the great reviews. Very happy I did! I wanted it to be very personal for my fiance. The ring was absolutely beautiful! Jeanne takes her time with you and is very honest. Her staff was always in communication with me and very transparent throughout the process. The order was a rush and kudos to the Classic Rock staff and partners for making it happen!</text>

We had such an amazing experience at Classic Rock shopping for our wedding bands.  They have an extensive selection and their entire staff is so friendly and genuinely cares.  They truly want to help you find exactly what you're looking for and take into account your budget.  I would highly recommend visiting Classic Rock for any of your jewelry/accessory needs.  I'm sure you will also have a great experience if you visit!< /review>

I purchased new matching wedding bands in 14k white gold.  Classic Rock has a large selection of styles.  They are also make custom jewelry.   I had an earring made into a pendant.  It turned out exactly how I envisioned it so I'm very happy.</text>

It was exquisite and, just as important, ready when they said it was going to be ready. Jeanne and Aysel are just wonderful people who care about the things you care about. They take the time to get to know you and try to really understand what you want. They are honest, trustworthy and know their stuff.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Jeanne and her staff were very kind and informative.  They helped me with any questions I had and worked hard to help me find the engagement ring I wanted.   I was very happy that they let me do it my way, answering my questions and being supportive without being pushy or trying to give me their "sales pitch".   I had a rough idea of what I wanted and what kind of information I needed, and at many other places I found it hard to get through the process in the driver's seat, so to speak.   Other places were always trying to sell me on a certain ring or a certain philosophy - Jeanne and her staff at The Classic Rock were far better at just being supportive and informative when I had questions, but more importantly also give me space take my time and think about my decision, and to look at the stones as I chose.   They also had a microscope setup that I used regularly which was very convenient (some other places don't have that).  Overall very informative, very honest and very helpful.  5 stars!!< /review>

Classic rock is my salvation. I'm always at a loss what to get my wife for special occasions. Classic Rock always has beautiful pieces in a wide variety of styles and I can always find something I just know my wife will love. The staff is very patient and helpful and not at all pushy. And, they have great style taste so they can see the kind of things I'm considering and show me other pieces I might like even more. I have bought a number of pieces over the past several years and my wife has loved every single one of them. They are the best.< /review>

<Text>Classic Rock has been amazing in helping my boyfriend and I to design our own engagement ring! From the first day we walked in, they welcomed us and were so kind and helpful. I worked with Shawn and she was so knowledgeable and patient as we worked though the design and creation process. Jeanne also helped me make the best decisions possible for the ring. And now I have my dream ring! Thank you so much, Classic Rock!< /Text><time>1527365480510< /time><user_name>Allison A.</user_name>< pics>

I had been looking for a watermelon tourmaline for several years. I came to classic rock and Jeanne found options for me to look at in two days!! Some of the most amazing combinations of colors I had ever seen, and I’ve been looking. The service was excellent, Jeanne and the crew kept in contact with me through out the whole process. Amazing place!</Review>

<Text>The team at Class Rock is fantastic.  Jeanne Katsuro's depth of knowledge sets her apart.  I love that along side the stunningly sophisticated top-of-the-line pieces, Classic Rock offers beautiful moderately-priced items, too.  Jeanne took as much time with me as if I were a high roller.  I may never be rolling in the dough, but I do know that I'll be using Classic Rock for all my jewelry needs in the future.</Text>< Rating>

I did most of my business with Jeanne over the phone and she was very helpful. When I went to pick up the ring in person, we looked over everything again and I got to see the diamond under the microscope. She pointed out any flaws upfront, and overall, was very easy work with.< /text>

Our salesperson Kaleo was super helpful in providing a range of choices in terms of styles, sizes, and materials. He also priced out all the combinations we were interested in, and at no point did we feel pushed into anything beyond what we wanted to spend. We picked out bands that we're both stoked on, and the whole process was easy and enjoyable thanks to our wonderful salesperson and the rest of the staff at the Classic Rock.< /Review><name>Nicholas Arduini</name><pictures>None</pictures>< UserId.>

The help and service that I got from Jeanie was enough alone for a 5 star review...then factor in the quality and value of the jewels and I wish I could give 10.
I initially came in with my fiance a few months ago looking for engagement/wedding rings. The quality of the rings were great and very reasonably priced compared to the other stores we've been to.
Eventually we opted to get the setting at another store, but returned to Classic Rock because of the great service we got months before.
Jeanie not only gave me a great deal on a beautiful diamond, but taught me a bit about stones and helped me set up insurance on the ring.
I will definitely recommend Classic Rock to my family and friends.< /Text>

I always learn so much from Jeannie and staff at Classic Rock.  I created a custom wedding band and engagement ring for my wife.  Making the right choice on jewelry can be very daunting, but the staff here is very knowledgeable and friendly.  I always recommend my friends and family to visit theme whenever they start looking for engagement rings.</Text>

Jeanne went above and beyond to help us with our  rush order, and even pointed us in the right direction for some local eats!

Will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone!< /text>

Jeanne was very thorough in her explanations of the diamonds.  The educational class was helpful for individuals who don’t know very much about diamonds and I would highly recommend it!< /Review>

Outstanding customer service and high-quality product keeps me coming back to Classic Rock in San Jose. This team of dedicated gemologists and professionals knows they are my jeweler of choice. I have become loyal over the years to Classic Rock because I'm treated with great respect and attention to detail that is really unmatched in the retail industry.<//Review>

After several months I am finally writing this review for this amazing establishment.  I came here, with my girlfiend, around July to attend the diamond class that they offer.  I literally knew nothing when it came to diamonds (they all sort of looked the same to me) but Shawn was very diligent in informing us about the basics of diamonds and how they are categorized.  She tailored the lesson as we went along to discuss topics that we had more interest in.  It really felt like a class!  We compared sizes, colors and clarity of diamonds and she brings out examples to compare, giving us a clearer picture of the topics she was explaining.  The class itself is very in depth and informative, it ultimately helped me make a choice for my purchase of an engagement ring.

I came back a few months later in September I emailed The Classic Rock and made an appointment to come in, hoping to get the process started on choosing an engagement ring within the one hour I had prior to work.  The staff is very welcoming and attentive to all of your ideas and requests, as well as your time constraints!  Ruth had brought up the information that was written down during the diamond class we took in July so it was easy to choose a round cut, but she helped me decide what diamond size range I wanted to go with.  After this visit they had ordered a few diamonds that fit the criteria we discussed within my one hour visit.

A few days later the diamonds arrive and I am again at the store deciding between carat weights of the selected diamonds that fit the criteria I chose.  It was such a simple process as Ruth, Shawn and Jeanne provide input on all the pro's and cons between the diamonds in terms of different aspects of the diamonds themselves.  I thought I'd have a little more stress in this choosing process but it was so simple coming here. I went with a 1.51 carat VS2 F clarity round cut!  I cannot stress how simple it was to get this process started and for them to work around my time constraints and take into consideration my budget.  My ring was basically done; my diamond was chosen, the band was chosen and I just had one last request.  I wanted to add a little detail to the band and requested to place a small sapphire stone on one side of the band so only she could see it.  Ruth took the request and made it happen!  She gave an example of the finished product while the ring was being put together and I was overly satisfied with the result.

Fast forward 4-6 weeks in October later and the ring was finished.  I pretended to go to the gym but I really picked up the ring!  Fast forward again to November at the Conservatory of Flowers in SF where I proposed to my girlfriend.  She said yes of course!  All thanks to The Classic Rock.  I still cannot believe how easy they made it for me to choose a ring.  I highly recommend this place to any guy looking to purchase an engagement ring.  I promise it isn't as scary as you'd think, as long as you come here!</text>

< Review>
Went to Classic Rock to have a couple rings resized--my anniversary band with diamonds, and also a tanzanite and diamond ring.  Jeanne and JoAnne were so helpful and friendly--always a joy to work with them.
I picked up my rings two weeks later.  I am very pleased with the results!
They also have a fine selection of fine jewelry.  Would highly recommend a trip to Classic Rock !<//Review>

I live over an hour away from San Jose, and decided to visit here while going there for an errand. I had been thinking about a single strain pearl necklace for my wife and had done some research online to see which direction i wanted to go.

Since my wife is not big into Jewelry, i wanted to be sure what i was getting and ensure it was done right. After discussion, there was an unstrung strand of Japanese Akiko pearls that were just what i had been envisioning.

They went into action calling goldsmith and were going to string themselves that night if he couldn't do it. Picked a clasp and picked up 2 days later which was Christmas Eve (was ready end of next day).

Excellent and Warm service, caring and knowledgeable staff and feel I got an exquisite piece that doesn't look like it came from ebay.

I had such a great experience, i'm planning on going back at end of next year for a diamond upgrade. Thanks!</text>

The workers were very pleasant.  However,  the food did not come out as requested.  I find their fries and wings to be overly cooked.< /review>

< Review>
So glad this was my first time ordering here so now I know not to return. Not only did it take over 20 minutes to make the order, when the staff memeber said 10-15. I ordered a boneless wings combo, instead I was given bone in wings, when I called to complain about it, neither staff member I spoke with even apologized. I was unable to go back and get it fixed but that does not change the fact that it was there own mess-up, and on top of that no apology from them. Never spending a penny here again.< /Review>

We had the bone in Lemon Pepper wings and the Louisiana Dry Rub wings. Both very good. I like the Lemon Pepper wings more. Their online menu seems to have lower prices than when you walk in. We did get the lower price on 20 wings.< /Review>

Between Christmas and New Year's Day I stopped into this location for the first time. Astoundingly the boneless wings that I ordered were soo good--cooked to perfection. It inspired me so much that I went back 2 times and added the Wingstop party pack for 50 to my festivities. Thank you!

This experience revived my love for Wingstop after a 5 year stint of not returning after a few locations overcooked the boneless and bone-in wings, over seasoned or left the experience very dry. Kudos to your team for getting it right. Had to stop my busy schedule to give you the best review ever. Happy New Year 🍗🥤🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</text>

The chicken is fine but the service and servers seem disorganized.  I’ve experienced delayed and mistaken orders here, and never an apology or consideration from the staff. I’ll stop patronizing this one and drive further to the Colorado Blvd establishment.<//Text>

<text>It's ok. You have to know what you want. I randomly chose two flavors that sucked. It's subjective but to me the Louisiana dry rub was terrible and used too much paprika.
The Korean is good but choosing flavors feels a little too much like throwing darts.
The carrots and celery are clean, nice and crisp.
Literally the pizza hut of wings. YMMV.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Love the service! They have great food and love the taste in music. The only problem is they seem to take awhile for food, but overall it's a great place to eat at!< /Review>

<Review>Did an online order, they missed 3 items. I called to let them know I was missing 3 items and I kept insisting it was not there. Forget the fries and veggie sticks they forgot. It’s the 4 each sides I paid for that got me upset.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I initially ordered with doordash and they apparently gave my food out to the wrong person so I have up and just drove there to get food. The boneless wings tasted good but man they are small. Not sure if that's normal for wingstop, but they are more like chicken poppers than wings.< /Text>

< review>
I was out for my evening walk and decided to get some quick food to munch on. I ended up at Wingstop near PCC. I was greeted by a friendly hello as I entered the store. All the covid-19 protocols posted on the door were being followed. I gave the girl my order and stepped outside to wait for it to be prepared. I ordered a selection of boneless chicken wings... Garlic parmesan and mango habanero. I also decided it was time to try their fresh cut fries again.

When the food was ready, she motioned for me to come inside. And I was on my way home.

All of the food was good and was perfect to munch on, while watching a movie on TV. Great flavor and texture with the chicken wings. The fresh cut fries were excellent!

While the inside is closed for sit down, they do have a table or two out front. There is street parking, as well as a parking lot in the back of this shopping area.

I will definitely be back again... I want to try some of the other sides.

P.S.... I ordered the boneless chicken combo at Liela's suggestion ... Wings, fries, and drink... All for just over 10 bucks. Good value..<//review>

<Review>Tried this for this first time the other day, I'm a big fan of buffalo wild wings and have been looking for an alternative that doesnt need me to clear my scedule to go to. I have to say I was not let down. The meals are really economical and a good amount even for the smallest one. They have many fry options and the fries that come with your order of wings are seasoned very nicely. The flavor of the wings themselves is pretty good as well! My only complaint is that they take a while so make sure you're not in a rush or else.<//Review>< user_id>

Last time I was here, the wings were very dry and didn’t have a lot of flavor. I’m not sure if we got a bad batch or they just made our food in a hurry. I give it 4 stars because I love wingstop but like I said; the wings I had were dry</text>

<text>Likely my mistake to get parmesan tenders with bleu cheese dip. Despite being extra salty it was still good. I was told their wings do a lot better with the same combination. I was a little confused with how to return the tray and dispose of trash as I didn't find any trash cans ans ended up just leaving the tray on the counter.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Rob (Manager) is the best! Got me in and out in less than 2 hours for 4 new tires, a complicated alignment, full inspection, and personal review of my 1998 Dodge 2500 4x4. Excellent staff✅ Tires are A/Ts but work GREAT in the snow! AndyG 😎</review>< response>

<Review>This place has very wonderful employees always helping you out on what you need just went in for another 2 more tires for my car and the wait time was about an hour I was out in less then 30 minutes or so. They really get you back on to your personal life and not take to long and time off your hands... definitely will be back for more tires..<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I purchased tires about a year ago, had a nail/screw in one and came in using the warranty. After getting brand new tires, the next day I had an issue w/one, went back and because the screw was in the side wall they replaced the tire 100%.

I dropped my vehicle off at 9:13am and I didn't drive off until 5:40pm. I am happy with the quality of work that they do at Les Schwab but I didn't expect shocks, an alignment and a rotation to take 8 hours. The customer service is phenomenal as I usually experience when I visit a Les Schwab at any location across the country.< /Text>

Thank you Dominic for making sure my tires were balanced correctly. I will no longer go to les swab in victorville /ADELANTO.  Its worth it for me to just take my cars to hesperia to have it done right the first time. Thanks again Dominic.  Want to say thanks in person  but you were super busy</review>

Jacob was phenomenal, he answered the phone before they're even open with pep and vigor. It was quite helpful and led me into the direction to not only save money but to get the most value out of the tires. The young lady at the front was also quite nice. I could say that I honestly enjoyed my experience and the three hours that I waited for the service will be completed flew by with the help of HGTV. If you are in need of tires please consult Jacob, he will not steer you towards the most expensive Tire oh, he will evaluate your needs and give you the tires that you need :-)< /Text>

Hi jacob(the manager). They guarantee the job. We will see. Only lost 5 pecent of new tires ! 😂🤣😂🤣😿😢😂😭😭😭 so everyone always double check & come back. ..(ASK FOR ROTATION ON TIRES. not free or included)  But  they say they will fix the problem. Good people here.
Update: 5 stars. Thank you jacob. You have earn a customer for life. After new suspension, new struts, new tires, new brakes, new calipers. I need a company to really depend on. Thank you!

I went in for "4" new tires oil change and alignment. Tires wonderful oil changed, alignment whole different story.
To
make long story short I was told I had lots of damage and needed 1200.00 worth of parts and labor before they could do the alignment. Thank goodness I took it home and had my brother and son in law check it and guess what there was nothing WRONG took it to another shop had alignment done no problem.I feel they were trying to take a 65 y/o widow to the cleaners</text>

I went to Pep Boys and was denied service due to being close to closing time. Decided that I would try Les Schwab before I attempt the long drive home on a spare. I pulled up at 5:50pm, 10 minutes before closing time. I was greeted by Rob who said it would be no problen to help. He repaired my tire, which I was expecting to replace, and had me on my way faster than expected. This is the definition of "world class" customer service. Simply amazing!<//text>

I paid $700 cash for a set of tires while on a road trip.. All of the weights came off of one of the tires. The Hesperia store is refusing to service the tire putting my family’s safety at risk. Do not trust this company. There do not care about their customers.<//Review>

As always great service.  Pull into the parking lot and the manager hustles out to the car to see how they can help me. He immediately pulls it in and has his workers start working on it. Before I even finished filling out the paperwork.  In and out of there super fast. Thanks again Les Schwab for a job well done.</Text>

Great Service.!! I was met in the parking lot going into the store. The service rep asked me what brought me to Les Schwab. I had 4 trailer tires,  he sized them up and walked me into the shop. In a minute i had a fair price and tires rolling off the bed of my truck ready for replacement.< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>My car never leaked before taking in on for a wheel alignment, when they did the wheel alignment, Iowa's told the rack in pinon boots were leaking badly and unwound need to replace it, at the cost of $1000. When the car was brought out of the bay both sides were still leaking.... checked the power steering pump and the fluid level was still full. I drive home and checked it again with same results full. Don't know what they did but I believe they poured oil all over the boots to make me think it needed to be replaced, cleaned up and washed the oil off and I still have not yet seen a oil leak. What a scam of a shop. I will never take my car back to this shop. I called auto zone and the part was only $160. U called another les Schwab location and they said it would be only about$500 for parts and labor. Wow big difference in prices here. Sorry I had to give them a 1 star because there is no 0 stars
Nate, FYI there is still no leaks after cleaning the rack and boots power steering fluid remains full. There was absolutely no leaks before bringing in my car, and still no leaks after driving a couple hundred miles. There is nothing wrong with it. So the question is where did the fresh oil come from, as it didn't come from the rack and pinion< /Text>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1551909331193, 'text': "Albert, a leaking rack and pinion is not an uncommon issue.  Especially after being on the road for 18 years and over 250,000 miles.  I apologize for any discrepancies in the quotes you received, but I assure you that we are not dumping oil on parts to make you believe they are bad.  I would strongly suggest that you get a second opinion about this, so the issue doesn't get worse.  Thank you.  - Nate"}</response>< gmapID>

Best service I have received in a very long time! I called in and talked with Jacob and explained to him that the sound I was hearing from my tires was a little unnerving. I drove into the parking lot and before I got out I was greeted by a salesman. High fives to Seth and the other gentlemen who worked diligently getting my tires on my 2000 Honda Civic EX Coupe. The short drive home was quiet and smooth. Thank you guys and gal for the superb service! I highly recommend them!!<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I needed a tire patch and alignment. I was promptly greeted in the parking lot by a friendly employee. The alignment price was about the same as competitor prices but the patch was free.  All the employees were friendly and seemed genuinely happy to have my business. They have 8 service bays.   Four  in the front and four in the back.  This location just opened last week as of this posting. They had coffee and popcorn as well as vending machines.   There's also a Wendy's in the parking lot if you need a bite to eat if waiting for your vehicle.  All tire shops try to upsell but these guys were not pushy at all.  They're just doing their job. I'll definitely be back.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c36872e8e1d3bf:0x3a38c1298cf6a067<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Tire install was complete. Vehicle was sitting in parking lot. Took almost 30 mins for someone at the front desk for service. There was 1 customer being waited on. Employees just walked by me and didn't even ask if I needed assistance. They need to train their employees in customer service. The only reason I have to go back is warranty service. Otherwise not.</Review><Rating>2</Rating><user>116086098419109150748<//user><GmapID>0x80c36872e8e1d3bf:0x3a38c1298cf6a067<//GmapID>< time>

Very disappointed, I spoke with a sales rep a month back about getting tires for my truck and he clearly knew alot about offroad tires and gave me 10 or so different options. I was ready to buy them and the sales lady gave me only two tires for an option that were way higher than what I was previously quoted. Im going to Americas Tires $200 less for a better tire of the same size. You guys lost a $1500 sale due to your sales lady being lazy and having an attitude. She worked 1/2 at 1:00pm just didnt get the name.</Text>

Les Shwab is the best tire shop I've been to hands down there prices might be a bit more but completely worth it all there tires a have the best warranty plus the customer service is the best they come running to your car as soon as you pull in and they have diagrams of how bad your alignment is and how they leave it when your done to ensure that the job was done right and they also take good care of your wheels they even wash them after being worked on so I'd recommend this spot to anyone who needs tires or a quick patch<//Review>

I took my car to get new tires because i already had my spare on the car.i asked them to keep my spare and replace my 2 bad tires.while waiting i could see one of the workers pointing at my tires and laughing.he even grabbed 2 other co workers to show them whatever was so funny.they were just looking and laughing not even qorking on my car.then they took my spare left my flat in the truck.and when i pointed out the mistake the worker tried to blame me for not telling the lady at the front desk.and tried to blame the lady in the front for writing up the order wrong.then after waiting for them to fix the problem none of them apologized.not even a have a nice day.nothing.who wants to spend almost 200 dollars to be laughed at and be belittled.thanks no thanks.will never go back.<//review>

HORRIBLE, my daughter had a 1pm appointment to have her brakes replaced. I had to call them at 4:45 PM and tell them they needed to replace my daughters brakes.  My question, why did she have to wait 3+ hrs and I have to call and tell them they need  to get the brakes done. Also why do they take walk ins before appointments?<//Text>

We walked in, didn’t see what we needed and walked out, the guy running the place came out and asked what we were looking for and he had it, we just didn’t look hard enough! Their prices are great, comparable even to what I see online, great customer service, and an awesome selection of bait and tackle, snacks, and beer!< /Review>< gmap_id>

What a great place. I walked into the shop. Now I only have fishing setups for steurgion, stripper. But didn't have a setup for salmon. Now I know a little about fishing so I top Rick, just set me up with something good. So he looked at 6 different rods and when he felt that he had 2 that were just about right he handed them to me and said feel these 2 and tell which one you would pick. G Loomis  was the pick. Now the reel. Shamono in know was the choice and he pick one with a deep spool setup just in case I got a runner. Loaded it up with so 30lb braid line and I was done. Went out fishing right after purchase first drift 30 salmon in the boat. 2nd drift 10 lb salmon in the boat. Rod felt great, reel was smooth , and the line really connected me to where I could feel what the fish was doing and heading. Exelent service. Thank you rick.<//text>

They were dog friendly and the staff was super attentive and overall awesome. I’m picky about my wines from living in Nor Cal and was blown away with the quality of SAMsara wines. I ended up joining their wine club and each shipment has been fantastic. They are by far one of my favorite wineries. I have even gifted a couple of bottles to friends and my friends absolutely loved the wine. I  highly recommend this winery it is a true gem.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Great wine in Goleta! Finally, in our backyard, we have a wonderful winery with excellent reds and a fun venue to relax and drink good wine at the end of the day...or even in the middle of the afternoon! The friendly staff make you and your dogs feel welcome. We love the patio area that has been "Covid" approved and feel safe while enjoying superb wine.< /Text>< Name>

Great and cozy wine tasting experience. Beyond the fabulous wines (Syrah my favorite) SAMsARA has done a great job on the outdoor patio. Comfy furniture, fire pits and space heaters. Turns a chilly fall tasting into a super comfortable experience. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly and fun. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Very nice people and extremely good wines! Would like to have gone inside but rules are rules these days. Really enjoyed the product and joined the wine club and bought a case. I have long enjoyed the wines of the Santa Barbara area and this establishment is no exception.  Great stuff!!<//Review>

<Text>SAMsARA has been the perfect neighborhood winery. The staff is always kind and welcoming. They have adapted to COVID-19 with not even the blink of an eye. Oh- and the wine is pretty yummy too! We just love the natural fermentation process. Never being Rosé people we fell in love with theirs!<//Text>< pictures>

I was staying in Goleta in order to do some wine tastings outside of Santa Barbara around May 2019. This was a pleasant surprise to find, we went back twice during our stay. Super tasty wine.<//text>

We enjoyed the wine and ended up purchasing two bottles. The flavor of the Chardonnay was both familiar and unique. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The space outside was large and it felt very safe during this crazy time of social distancing. They accept walk ins but recommend reservations.<//Text>

<Review>We've been members since 2016 as we were impressed with their Rhone varietals and Pinot Noir wines.  We learn so much by experiencing wines from single vineyards, which provides the opportunity to taste the uniqueness and complexities associated with each vineyard.  While Chad Melville was the creator of Samsara, the new owners, Joan and Dave seem intent on keeping the quality and service that we expect from the winery.  Matt and Lily make us feel welcome when we come to visit by taking their time to describe the wines and seek our input.  We only wish we could make is down to SB more often.  Highly recommend a visit to either of their locations.< /Review></record>

Samsara In sanskrit means endless cycle of life, death and rebirth. They definitely give their grapes a rebirth with all their wine. This is the 1st and only wine tasting room in Goleta so far. Their tasting menu usually has one white and rest are red and recently included  a Rose as well. Their staff are very knowledgeable, especially Devon (I love how he enunciates his words) and Claudia, she is a newer member but just as friendly and knowledgeable and will provide a lot of information on each wine they pour. The winemaker sometimes is on site as well and always willing to share his thoughts, ideas and knowledge. Samsara has a very friendly atmosphere that serves good quality wine. Highly recommend.<//review>

Great little winery located just outside SB. If you staying at Bacara, it's a super short drive with much easier parking than heading all the way into SB. Fantastic Pinots and Syrah. Great service!< /Review>

<Review>My Wife and I found Samsara when we were looking for wineries near our hotel.

Upon doing some preliminary research, we found out Matt the Wine maker was originally from Florida and since we are from Fort Lauderdale we called him up and asked if we could do a tasting with him and he was more than happy to oblige.

We typically stock our Cellar with wines from boutique wineries that are 5000 cases or less for the obvious reasons.

When we arrived at the winery Matt and Lilly made us feel right at home.

When we sat down for the tasting, I knew right after the first sip, that we were going to become SAmsARA Wine Club Members and that Matt's wines were phenomenal.

The purity of Matts wines are incredible and a welcome part of our Cellar.

We can't wait to come back to visit. :)</Review>< UserId.>

<review>This is our favorite local wine spot in an area with plenty to choose from. When they first opened this location, I remember telling them about a delicious glass of Jaffurs wine I'd had...then I learned that the winemaker responsible for it had just joined the Samsara team! Good wines, CHECK. Nice & knowledgeable staff, CHECK...They've turned their "pandemic patio" (in the parking lot) into a relaxing place to linger for a tasting or glass, too. The fire pit, the lighting in the trees, the decor...It's a pretty cool transformation. I guess you could say we recommend Samsara in Goleta.< /review></record>

Small winery but very quaint and friendly staff as well as honest and professional service. We stopped by on a whim with my wife and really enjoyed talking to the sommelier and wine was very tasty. It was nice that one of the owners made it a point to stop by and say hello. We purchased three bottles and are thinking of becoming members also. Give it a try and I think you will like it.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>A wonderful experience! SAMsARA makes incredible Santa Barbara County wines and their Goleta Winery and Tasting Room is the perfect place to try them. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable; the atmosphere relaxed and welcoming. We’ve been here several times to taste/purchase and it’s always been terrific.

Recently, we were delighted with an “elevated tasting” (led by Winemaker Matt Brady and winery staff members Devon, Peter and Neal) that included a tour of the cellar, as well as a focused wine tasting. We learned so much about the wines…the process, the terminology, what to drink with what and when to drink it. I feel that my knowledge has increased exponentially!

Highly recommend a visit!</text>< pics>

SAMsARA is a true gem: Their case output is tiny, but their quality is massive. The tasting room at the Goleta winery is modern yet cozy & comfortable. The staff knows their wine, which may seem obvious but isn't always the rule but the exception. Save up your lunch money & plan a visit.</text>

Complex Syrahs using small lot fruit, whole cluster fermentation with high quality wines at competitive pricing.  Hospitality staff are knowledgeable and foster a great time at the tasting room bar.</text>

Samsara is such a gem! They make top-notch wines in the back and the incredibly knowledgeable and friendly staff pour them in a beautiful tasting room in the front. I am so happy that Samsara found their home in Goleta!<//Text>

Love this place!!!! It’s a little hard to find but DONT stop looking it’s TOTALLY worth the stop! AMAZING SANTA RITA wine! The perk is the staff (PETER) knows all about the wine and harvest. I learned a lot and love drinking wine knowing where it came from. A MUST TRY TASTING ROOM!</Review>

I consider this place a hidden gem as it is located in a less conspicuous spot. The people associated with Samsara are very friendly and knowledgeable and the wine is very good. If you like Pinot Noir you should give them a try.< /Text>

<text>We visited Samsara in Goleta in August with a group of friends. What a lovely and personal experience!  Exactly what we were seeking. Such a treat to meet everyone there and experience their terrific hospitality and fantastic wines. I knew the pinots, but not all of the other bottlings.  Between the chard, rose, and pinots, we ended up with a total of about two cases that we had shipped to us back East. Loved seeing the operation at this facility!  We’re huge fans and will definitely have Samsara on our radar for a long, long time.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Just left Samsara in Goleta .... wine education event with Matt the winemaker. Absolutely amazing!! We tasted multiple wines while learning about the Santa Rita Hills winemaking region. Great forum to ask questions, sample great wine, and develop a greater understanding of the philosophy behind Samsara!  If you have not had a chance to visit Samsara - you need to!  We try to tell everyone we know about Samsara simply because their wines are great!</review>

<time>1562626604323</time><Rating>5</Rating><text>I recently discovered SAMsARA Wine Co.'s Goleta Winery and Tasting Room and have had a number of excellent experiences there already.

First off, their wine is top notch.  I am a big fan of Santa Barbara County Pinot Noirs, Syrahs, Grenaches and Chardonnays, so I was really excited to discover that this is their exact wheelhouse.  From their single vineyard offerings to their multi-vineyard blends, I was thoroughly impressed.

Second, the tasting experience was really relaxed and pleasant.  My group was not in a rush and the staff members not only picked up on that, but encouraged us to take our time and enjoy the afternoon.  They also engaged each member of our group, regardless of how much each person knew about wine, which really made it special for the newbies.

Lastly, they have a great location.  Just a few turns off the freeway, with plenty of parking, and in the same business park as Captain Fatty's Brewery, I'll be back again soon!</text>< pictures>

Pizza by the slice...nothing more, nothing less. Pretty decent and affordable place in the neighborhood to grab a slice after a boozy night. For $5 slice, you can get variety of options which include vegetarian ones like veggie, cheese and pesto. One slice is pretty filling for one person. You're lucky if you get a fresh hot slice just out of the oven. There's a very small seating area too, and colas / water to buy.</text>

This place had a lot of promise when I walked in: great location, cute dining area and extensive menu --not to mention pizza by the slice.  But, as a New Yorker, this pizza was an insult.  I've had a better pepperoni slice from a supermarket.  Horrible.< /Text>

<review>Horrible horrible uncooked pizza. Because it was so bad and my stomach has been turning since I ate there last night I looked up the reviews and was totally shocked to see more than one star. I would give it zero if I could. I would say it's unbelievable that this place is in business but they cater to a non-repeat tourist crowd and don;t have to be held accountable. Cheese pizza was $4 a slice and pepperoni was $4.25 a slice but they charged us $4.55 per slice. After we paid she cleared the register so it looks to me like she's just taking cash under the table. I watched her ring people up with the wrong prices and take the cash while we were waiting for our slices. Horrible.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Very doughy.
I advice owner / Managment to try their pizza
To maintain quality.

<text>A big call that I don't take lightly, but this is the best pizza that my mates and I have ever tasted. And we've eaten our fair share. Do yourself a favour and get a slice of the combo and/or grilled chicken. Veggie is awesome as well. Amazing.<//text>< time>

<Review>Not a fan of the pizza at all - seemed more like a flatbread with a ton of bland tomato sauce and a sprinkling of mozzarella. Customer service was rude (not to me, but to other customers) and seemed completely stressed out. Expensive for what you get. Wouldn’t go here again. I would prefer to take my chances with a frozen pizza from the hotel lobby store.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>THE GOOD:

Honestly, can't think of one

THE NOT SO GOOD:

Cold pizza
not cooked enough
Vegetarian pizza is a joke

I hardly ever give a 1 star rating but this place disappointed us on so many levels. We had both ordered 2 wholes pizzas, My pizza was barely warm when I got to eat it, We were less than 5 minutes away from the pizza shop, So distance is not an issue regarding that matter.

On top of that, the dough had clearly not been cooked enough as it was still slightly uncooked in the middle.

The other pizza that we ordered was a Vegetarian pizza, which consisted of a few olives, mushrooms, peppers and tomatoes. One of the worse vegetarian pizzas I had ever seen and because there were no descriptions of the pizzas, one had no idea what they were getting. The pizza was also not hot and cooked through.

On a side note, something that I observed whilst there, someone had not received their whole order, they then had to make the pizza after they had received their first pizza which by the time they had gotten their second pizza, the first had been standing for over 10 minutes. I honestly do not know how places like this stay in business, my feeling is because there are so many hotels around that people only really eat here once.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8085808e50e2a55d:0x256219604ec77c4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Worst Pizza I ever had in my life. They really should rethink their business plan. $4.00 for a horrible slice.  Frozen pizza is way better. Dough was soft, sauce tasteless, cheese tasteless. Garbage.<//Review>

Staying at the Hilton and this was the closest pizza place. Only a couple minutes walk. About 10 bucks for two HUGE slices of pizza. I posted a pic of the current menu. I didn't see a sign that posted their hours, but when I asked the lady that worked there, she said they closed at three a.m.!</review>

I ordered a slice of pesto pizza and a slice of salami. I literally watched the guy take two slices of cheese pizza (already baked), add the toppings and more cheese, and rebake them. Also the hamburger patties are definitely frozen. The staff seems both upset and confused.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The pizza is delicious, thin crust and tasty. I tried a slice of Pesto, Combo and Pepperoni each - they were lovely. We were tempted by the freshly made gelato and caved in to try luscious chocolate gelato... Yumm! I do recommend a helping of gelato with the pizza if you do peep in here.</text>< user>

<review>I walked in without checking reviews so went in blind. Ordered a slice of Pepperoni and took two bites. The pizza was disgusting, horrible tasting cheese. I left the rest next to a sleeping homeless person but wouldn't be surprised if they gave it to their dog,  and hope at least the dog would eat it.< /review><GmapID>0x8085808e50e2a55d:0x256219604ec77c4</GmapID>< rating>

When the door we ordered came in they called and scheduled a convenient time for us to install. The installer noticed some small defects in the door (so small we would never have noticed) and made the arrangements to order the entire panel and replace. The customer service was top notch and the door looks great. They we attentive and informative. It was a great experience and our garage door looks amazing< /review>

Whole experience was fast and efficient. Garage door is very quiet when going up or down.   Chose an insulated door that reduces summer garage heat by 30-40 percent.  it’s very nice and well worth the extra cost.

The Heritage representative who came to the house  to give us options and estimates was knowledgeable and knows his stuff.

The installer was very nice and did a good job-knows what he is doing.  Very good company.  My wife looked for a company with great reviews and found Heritage.   So I am adding to those good reviews here.  I recommend this company if you need a garage door.<//Text>

Heritage Garage Door is a great decision for anyone who is looking for garage door repairs or new replacements.  We first had them out to take a look at our existing door for some maintenance and got a quote for replacement.  When it came time to replace our door, the sales guy was extremely professional.  Had samples, had the ability to  put the garage door we liked in a computer program that showed us what it looked like on our house, and didn't try to up-sell us on anything.  The door is amazing and was installed very quickly and efficiently.< /text>

I have a three car garage. One two car door and a single car door. My two car garage door circa 1999 jammed internally and not having proper working over current protection proceeded to consume it self. It being  Saturday am I called the phone number on the tag by the opener. Hours later still no response. I googled Garage door repair, picked Heritage for being local and well rated. They came almost immediately and got the door closed. We discussed various options. Decided on new door and two new openers. They guaranteed to match the small door. They came as scheduled did the install and everything was fine...almost. The new door was slightly less white than the old door. They had promised to match exactly....Neither of us had noticed the old garage doors had been painted. After a couple days of negotiating Heritage decided the best solution was to replace the small door.  This they did quickly and as efficiently as the first door. I know this is long, but the entire story needed telling to demonstrate the lengths Heritage will go for customer satisfaction. I know without a doubt if I ever have garage door problems all I need do is call Heritage and they will respond quickly and professionally and resolve my problem.<//review>

I was very happy with the whole estimate to installation process. The service technician Doug was efficient and had good knowledge about installation and operation of the WiFi enabled garage door system. They are very helpful if you have to call them back for any support. I would highly recommend them.<//Text>

Heritage Garage Door is a wonderful company that understands customer service. The service technician arrived at my home and within ten minutes discovered the problem. He also explained in detail what it would take to fix the problem and the cost of the repair. The service was complete in less than 45 minutes and was very professional. Thanks Heritage for your customer service.< /text>

The technician from Heritage was both knowledgeable and efficient. He diagnosed the issue, had the new springs for our garage door in his truck and had them installed in about an hour and a half. If we ever need our garage door worked on again, we will call Heritage.</text>

We bought a garage door from Heritage years ago and have had a couple of service issues since -- long after we were out of warranty. Repairs have always been prompt and professional. Techs have also saved us money by not pressing us to go for the  most expensive options. We love them, and our next door or motor or whatever will certainly be from Heritage.</Text>

Upon inspecting the reason for service, Cody reviewed my options and related costs.  Once I made my decision, Cody got to work and completed the repair in less than 45 minutes - AMAZING!  He then tested the garage door a few times before I joined him and tested the door in my presence.  I'm very happy with the repair AND Heritage Garage Door, thank you very much!<//text>< pictures>

I've written a review about this company before. My experience was damaging my door by pulling it off track with a bicycle in the bed of my truck. Heritage responded within a hour of my call, repaired, adjusted, an d tuned up the door in 20 minutes. Great response time, good work, and the door has operated perfectly for over a year.<//Review>

Great experience- door activated when her car was half way out of the garage due to a faulty wall switch;- door hit car roof, reversed, then knocked itself off the tracks,  bending two door panels and pulling the steel cables off of the wheels. I assumed the door was totaled. The repair  tech quickly disassembled everything,  bent the door panels back perfectly, rewound the cables, rehung the door back into the tracks, cleaned up the finger marks, and Wa-La! You CANNOT tell there was ever a problem. These guys are great!<//text>

I called in to schedule an estimate for repair and Doug gave me a quote AND fixed all the issues with my garage door same day. Heritage was price effective and i had a wonderful experience. Doug was clear and precise with his diagnosis and repair recommendations. Super professional. I would highly recommend them.</review>

Doug has been very professional and thorough with his analysis. He put forth all the options and let us make the decision. He replaced our 12-yr old garage door opener with a brand new one. We are impressed with his work and professionalism.< /review>

<review>I want to say what great service I received when I brought my wife’s car in to have her windows tinted for her birthday.

From start to finish the service was top notch. I just bought a new truck and I’m certainly going to have VIP tint my windows.

Thanks for such great service and for being so friendly and professional.

Awesome customer service! Great waiting area. Have had two vehicles tinted by VIP Tint and they have done a top notch job. The staff there is very informative and polite. I recommend VIP Tint to all. I'm going to have them do my windows for my house soon.</review>

I was always recommended this business by all the car guys in the Murrieta/Temecula area. Everyone spoke so highly of them.

Throughout the years I have taken my cars to VIP Tint to get work done. The California sun can be brutal and getting a nice tint is always a must.

Their shop was always looking clean and even their lounge area if you wanted to wait was nice and comfy.

I have not been back since the start of the pandemic, but I am already planning to take my new car over to them to get some nice tint.

I can honestly say that VIP Tint is the place to be for all your window tinting needs. A honest group of professionals and extremely high quality work.

Don't look any further, this is the place you want to spend your money at. No regrets whatsoever.</Text>

<Date>1524025398470<//Date><rate>5< /rate><text>Best tint shop ever. This was my second vehicle done through them. A lot of my friends have also gone there and I've recommended many, the ones who have gone through with it have had zero regrets. Norman, the owner, really takes his company to the next level with his care and attention to detail and goes as far as doing vehicles alongside his employees.

The tint I have in the photos is the LLumar Pinnacle Formula One 15%. Extremely worth it's price. Windshield in this gallery isn't done, but will update soon, getting 30%, same tint formula.< /text>< pictures>

I’ve been going to VIP for many years. Norman and Jeremiah have always treated me well. I’ve never had a disappointing job done, and have had lots and lots of vehicles tinted. They repaired a couple windshields also. I recommend VIP to all my friends and family. They take the time to find out what you’re looking for and get you set up with something you’ll like.< /Text>

<Text>VIP came highly recommended by a family member who has had them work on a number of cars.  We scheduled an appointment on a Saturday.  When we arrived they were ready and waiting for us, were very helpful in guiding us through the services offered and helped us get just what we were looking for.  Once decisions were made, they immediately got to work and finished the car in just two hours.  Quality of workmanship is exceptional.  Would recommend to anyone as as the "go to" place for window services.<//Text>< pics>

I wish I had chosen a darker tint on my windows the last time I got my car windows tinted though. It was kind of hard to tell how dark the tint will be against a wall. I would recommend placing samples in front of a window. The application of the tint is great though.</text>< pictures>

After scheduling with another Tint company who backed out of a weekend appointment VIP Tint and Glass was able to get me in and get me out in a very fast and timely manner. The quality was excellent and the way the different degrees of tint were explained to me was top notch customer service. Once I can get approval from my company I'll be bringing my work truck back for windshield work.</Text>

Thanks to everyone at VIP Tint and Glass! They did an amazing job on my tint. Came out super clean and was done a lot sooner then expected. Very knowledgeable they explained all the different tints and helped me choose the right one for what I was looking for. I went with the pinnacle 5% on back 15% on two fronts. Highly recommend them! Going back soon to get windshield and tail lights done.< /Review>

<Text>I brought my Honda Passport in to have the front windows tinted and I'm so pleased with the results! First of all, it's a perfect match to my back factory tinted windows and secondly, it has really helped cool my drive down in this heat! VIP Tint & Glass is the best! We have brought other vehicles in thru the years and have not been disappointed. Great customer service and fantastic work!<//Text>< pics>

I have used VIP Tint and Glass for my 2 cars.   I was impressed with their professionalism and customer service. They helped me understand the differences about their product and helped me make an informed decision. I’m very pleased with the job and my car looks great. During the hot summer days my car stays cool. Thank you.</review>

Did a FANTASTIC job!!!  had to strip off a bad tint job from a Mobile tint guy (Dead Eye Tint) and VIP reinstalled new tint the correct way. They gave me an estimate, got the truck right in and had it done same day as promised. They were honest and gave me a fair price. These guys are professional, courteous and know how to tint . Cant say enough good things about VIP !</text>< Date>

<review>I have absolutely no knowledge of cars or tint. The technician, I wish I got his name, made me very comfortable and was very informative. I completely endorse this company and recommend them for all your tinting needs<//review><Date>1588725648154< /Date>< username>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>VIP Tinting continues to be the leader in tinting for my money, because they follow up with their clients even after the work is completed. We’ve had three vehicles done at VIP Tinting, the most important one carries our 5 month old grandson, with 360 degree protection from the Southern California sun.
VIP Tinting checks on us, makes sure all is well and reenforces the meaning of a quality product, and outstanding customer service during and after the sale. We will continue to use VIP Tinting well into the future.</Text>< pics>

< review>
This place is AWESOME! I recently got my dream car tinted and Dave helped me through almost making a huge mistake LOL this man is a saint. He was so patient and very kind to me and that goes a long way I can't type the entire story but let's just say I was literally getting on my OWN nerves, and Dave calmly explained and got me what I wanted . The guys in the back who applied my tint did a great job I wish I knew their names so I could shout them out but they were quick efficient and professional and the results are beautiful. The waiting area has a couch and t.v. and complimentary snacks and drinks. I highly recommend working with V.I.P. and I will go to them for all of my cars in the future.<//review>

<text>First, let me premise this review with my years patronizing VIP Tint.  I had been using VIP Tint for all my auto tint needs for more than 15 years.  Despite leaving the area and residing in various counties (San Bernardino, San Diego, and Riverside), I still bring all my vehicles to VIP Tint in Temecula/Murrieta.
On 13 January 2020, I made a 0900 appointment for (yet) another vehicle.  When I spoke with the owner, he was unable to afford me any discount on my tints so I decided to forego my headlight protector.  It was going to cost a great deal of money for my daily car.  After a few minutes, he offered a $25 discount so I could avail of this protector.  The films were already cut for my vehicle anyway.  Hence, whether I get it today or some other time, he stated that the film will just be laying around.  To assist and ease the owner of his trouble, I decided to grab the opportunity.
After an hour or so, another customer came for a set of tint—similar to mine.  He was offered $10 difference from my quote.  He had a Mercedes crossover—larger than my 4-door sedan.  In my mind I thought they could not afford me any discount but here you go, another customer came by and received the discounted price for the tints.  I had to give them the benefit of the doubt hoping they will honor the same quote for my car.
Nevertheless, when I was about to pay for my tints, a Caucasian male employee with long white (gray) beard, informed me that I was not going to get the same price but only a $5 discount.  I informed him to bill me the initial amount.  To my amaze, he was hostile, uncouth, unprofessional, and curt.  He raised his voice on several occasions, even with the other customer around, shaming me for inquiring about the $5 discount.  I am a Navy combat Veteran with more than 25 years in service.  I could not imagine this employee would have the audacity to create a scene because he could not offer me the same price as the other customer.  I was merely inquiring on fair deals with all VIP Tint customers.  Furthermore, he went on by comparing their shop with McDonald’s and Kohl’s and inquired if I was going to bargain with them, as well, even if I seldom visit the store/restaurant.
Needless to say, he continued to raise his voice and inquired how much would I want to pay.  I remained calm and informed him to bill me, once again, the initial amount to forego any further argument.  He persevered to bill me $5 less vice equal cost as the other customer.  He revealed that this customer was a return customer six months ago—unknowingly to this rude employee, I was also a return customer six months ago with a different vehicle.  Through the years, VIP Tint does not use a computerize system for their business.   They use “paper receipts” for every transaction.
I firmly believe in supporting fellow “kababayans” (countrymen and women) in order to thrive and be successful.  However, I did not expect this employee to degrade and condescend customers the way he did for I am simply pointing out equal treatment for customers—whether one drives a luxury vehicle or not.  Completing this review was utterly spiteful knowing that someone would treat customers differently.  He was a bully and did not deserve to be in the service industry.
Overall, I would unquestionably NOT RECOMMEND VIP Tint for any job—auto tints, windshield replacement, and others.  They have a horrific customer service.  (And) To all my “kababayans,” fellow Veterans, and honorable citizens in the community, I hope you do not fall into this same predicament.  I would not wish this to any of you.  The consequences of these inexcusable actions ought to be severe.  I informed the crude employee that this was my last transaction doing business with VIP Tint.  He was not concerned at all.  No remorse of any kind.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1579819987181, 'text': 'Hello sir,\n\nI think there is some confusion going on with your transaction. We gave you a $35 discount on your total purchase. You can break that down to $20 off the tint and $15 off of the headlight protection. You seem to be comparing the other customers discounted price to your original price. You recieved a $35 discount compared to his $20 discount.

Best tint shop around. If your looking for someone to do your 2017 civic hatchback come here. They don't have to remove the wing like other shops. They bought the hatchback glass to shrink the tint to and they stand by their work. Great shop and great prices.< /review>

I brought my Subaru here in 2015.. the staff helped me out on which tint to use and made the decision very easy. The overall price was lower than all the places I looked up and it only took a couple hours to finish. I waited a couple years to do the review because I wanted to see if the tint bubbled out or had any problems in the heat we live in. Zero issues! 5 stars for sure. Thanks guys.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Hello potential customers,
After over 4 years and thousands of dollars spent, we have finally got our google page back and are again on google maps.  Around 5 years ago when we moved from our smaller location, google decided to suspend our account with no explanation and no way to contact them other than email.  Well now they have a phone option and we were finally able to get it back up for us.  Unfortunately at the time of suspension we had 80+ 5 star reviews and google is trying to get them to publish if it is possible.  Im hoping they do because those reviews were from 2004-2010 and it took a lot of hard work to establish us as a reputable shop.  I hope the lack of reviews doesnt scare you away from our shop.  Feel free to look up our yelp account where we have accumulated over 100+ reviews.

Thank you,
Norman David< /Review>< Date>

<Text>I would say the bagels are good. However I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which is below my expectations. The eggs are mixing with water, the bacon is dry. And when I look at my recipe it cost more than 8 dollars for that sandwich. I would rather order a single bagel.</Text><Name>Qiaoyi Liu</Name><Time>1621879063631< /Time><rate>3</rate><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

What a super little niche near the hospital. We had realized there was a wonderful little plaza nearby. The grocery store was really convenient and friendly, we took our little dog throughout the plaza enjoying the gorgeous weather and surroundings. Unfortunately somebody was having a very bad day at the House of bagels! What,who? appeared to be "upper management"!? Quarreled, concerning a bagel dog whose interior temperature was cold and,"possibly dangerous"?
Thankfully one of his subordinates acquiesced to reheat a new one. Why after the Batman ordered me to throw the cold bagel dog into the trash, exclaimed you if that I charge you!? 🤮< /Review>

< Review>
Picked up a some breakfast on my way to work and saw a line out the door! But they were so quick and efficient I was at the front of the line in under 5 mins! The guy who helped me was kind and patient and we exchanged pleasantries, which seems to be lacking nowadays. It honestly gave me that neighborhood feel and comfort and that was my first time there. Any more bagel breakfasts, I'm definitely sure to stop here from now on!< /Review>

Best bagels in the Bay Area. Always fresh, and so many choices. They usually run out of many of them by the afternoon. I love the jalapeno ones, the garlic and the everything ones. Lots of cream cheese choices too, as well as drinks (sodas) and desserts. Great food.< /Text>

<Text>This fast early day bagel shop specializes in Bagels of many, many variations.  HOUSE OF BAGELS- EXCELLENT BAGELS OF COURSE. COMPARABLE TO STARBUCKS, PEETS COFFEE, EXCEPT STAFF WAS NOT FRIENDLY. LIKE EVERY DAY WAS MONDAY TO THE STAFF MEMBER... COFFEE IS GOOD,  AT TIMES BETTER THAN COMPETITION.
MANY LOCATIONS, CATERING, BULK ORDERS, PARTY TRAYS, ETC.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to the Palo Alto House of Bagels for over 40 years. This is their 5th location in that time. Same owner, same great bagels, same great service. Not all the HOBs are the same. This one is the original.< /Text>

The bagels turn super hard like rock if not consumed in 3/4 hours. If you want a dozen bagels for next one week, better buy a pack from a grocery store.<//Review>< pics>

I can honestly say that House of Bagels is the best bagel place in Palo Alto, possibly even the Bay Area. I rediscovered this place in the college years and have only continued to feed my obsession. I (ironically) live in NYC now, but can’t find a bagel as satisfying or delicious as this one. I have to get my fix when I come back for visits and HoB is always here producing fresh and delicious bagels. If you’re here an unsure where to get a delicious breakfast, come by and support one of the best!</review>

<Text>I have loved coming to house of bagel for the last 24 years. Today i saw a woman leaving and her bag ripped, half her bagels fell on the ground. She looked frustrated and was about to leave one of the employees came out and said he was going to replace them. The took the ones that fell on the ground and went back in yo get her replacement bagels. Great food, great people!!!!<//Text>< Time>

The bagels here are delicious, and so is the espresso! I had a cappuccino while waiting for them to compile to Baker's dozens, and it was impressive. Very friendly service, flexible and accommodating staff. I will be coming here again!</text>

Tried an Everything Bagel with scallion/ chive cream cheese. Non toasted. It was delicious. Bathrooms were clean and organized too.
They also carried Snapple.

<Review>As a native New Yorker, I can say that these are the best bagels in town made the authentic way... boiled and then baked. Great selection of bagels and cream cheese, lox and whitefish. As though they could get any better, you may be lucky enough to get one right out of the oven. A free mini bagel for your kid if you bring them along. Service is great and the staff is friendly.<//Review><name>Michael Rothstein<//name>< Resp>

This place still cooks eggs the right way...on the grill!  Best place to get a bacon, egg and cheese on a tasty bagel!  Service is good too.</Review>

I like their chicken salad here, and the black & white cookies are also tasty.  Prices are a little high, but service is friendly.  Wi-fi is free, with good speeds.  Never a huge crowd, so it's a nice place to enjoy a leisurely lunch a do a little work on the laptop.<//review>

< Review>
I've been coming here for approaching 2 decades, since they were originally on University Ave. My usual fare is the veggie sandwich on a sesame or everything bagel -- HOB's implementation fo this is one of my favorite sandwiches of all time. Oddly, I've been to HOB down in South Bay, in San Carlos, and up in SF -- this location makes everything better than the other locations (with San Carlos a decent 2nd). No hesitation about the 5 star rating -- this place is great.<//Review>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Elloway for 20 years now. He has an incredibly kind bedside manner and never suggests work beyond what is necessary for your best dental health. He gives you all the information you need to make your own decision. Every time I've needed a procedure it's been comfortable and painless. He has a special numbing machine you can't even feel! He's actually done a few fillings on me he didn't even need to numb for. Most recently we did Invisalign and my results have been fantastic. Dr. Elloway is a gentle, sweet, and honest man I would recommend to anyone (especially those nervous about the dentist!) His staff is awesome and the cleanings here are excellent as well.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have visited Dr. Elloway several times over the past few years. His office staff is friendly and efficient. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for my appointment, as he is prompt and seems to stay on schedule. Dr. Elloway is always concerned about his patients comfort and has a very gentle touch. He informs you of what he is seeing and doing as he is working on your teeth. I’ve noticed how he keeps up with current dental technology and has   all the equipment to provide state-of-the-art care and highest quality dental work.  If you are looking for a new dentist, or have dental problems that you need taken care of, I suggest you contact Dr. Elloway’s office for an evaluation. I know from experience that you will be highly pleased with the results of his work.< /Review>

<Text>Dr Elloway and his staff are beyond wonderful!  Our first visit was a month ago for my 96 yr old mother. She had an abscess and needed four teeth pulled. Her previous tooth-pulling experiences with other dentists had not gone well. Painful dry sockets and a lot if pain post procedure. Dr E was so careful and took his time with her to such an extent she couldn’t wait to go back!  Bedside manner rating is off the charts and quality of care as well I have never experienced this much care and interest in the patient. Today was our fourth visit putting some final touches on her new partial plate (flipper). Mom said I could go back every week! If you’re looking for quality care at reasonable prices this is the place. You will be greeted with a genuine welcome and know that you’re cared for. Lori is up front and Deanna assisted the good dr. Both as terrific as the doc. :-0.</Text>< Pics>

This is a state-of-the-art dental facility.  I’ve been coming here for many years.  Dr. Rob was the first dentist I’d heard of who started and finished a crown placement in the same sitting—no need for another day of missing work for the “final and permanent” crown.  My co-workers had a hard time believing that I was finished in just a couple of hours!

He and his staff are excellent and welcoming.
No waiting and no pain!< /text>

Dr.Elloway is one of the best dentist I have ever met! He takes the time to explain what he will be doing, makes sure you are completely comfortable, and always gives 100 percent when doing his restorations.His work is top quality....and each tooth he does looks anatomically perfect!!! He has an enormous amount of passion for dentistry, and it shows in the quality of work that he does.I have recommended both my family and friends to his office. If you are looking for a beautiful and natural looking smile, Dr.Elloway is definitely the dentist for you !!!</review>

His knowledge of dentistry is far superior than that of the dentists I know of in the Inland Empire. Everything is high quality, and he is a perfectionist. He uses the best labs, but he does not gouge his customers. He always gives options. His office staff are gracious, professional and remarkably accommodating. He is the only dentist for my family. My son is leaving for college, but he will continue to see Dr. Elloway because he does not want to change dentists, even if he has to use vacation time to see him.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

There is a reason we drive 200+ miles to see Dr Elloway despite the fact that we have many decent dentists right here at home.  Perfect work and commitment to his patients.  And Lori helps everything work like a Swiss Watch.</Text>

Dr Elloway takes the time to examine your teeth/bite and integrates new technology which improves precision and patient comfort. I’ve never had a painless dental block until coming to this office.

If you have a specific dental issue he will help you come up with a detailed customized treatment plan. In my case, it was addressing my nighttime teeth grinding.

Dr Elloway is the most gentle Dentist! His focus is only on you when you are in the chair, no hopping from room to room. I like that he explains everything he is doing and really takes his time to ensure you are always comfortable. The staff are equally awesome! You won’t be disappointed.<//Review>

I’ve been a patient of Dr. Elloway’s for over 15 years. After several negative prior experiences, I was relieved to meet a dentist who listens and is patient with their clients. Dr. Elloway now is my children’s dentist, and we make the drive from Murrieta because he and his staff are the BEST! If you are looking for an honest, caring, and competent dentist, give his office a call!<//Text>

Everyone is wonderful at Dr. Elloway’s office! I’m able to walk right in, get seen quickly-I never have to wait. I schedule an appointment every 6 months to have my teeth cleaned there. Thank you for taking care of my teeth!!<//Review>

I have trusted my smile to Dr Elloway for a little over 20 years. He uses the latest equipment very gentle and he is a perfectionist. He makes sure his work feels right and looks right. Yiikes you should see my before pictures.<//text>

< Review>
Extremely professional dentist and staff, very friendly, considerate,and trustworthy as well.
I have never felt so at ease at the dentist as I do here, I've had many filling and haven't experienced any pain. I really feel that Dr. Elloway truly wants the best for his patients and is willing to go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. Im nearing the end of my orthodontic treatment using Invisilign and I am very happy with my teeth, next up is bonding and possibly a couple dental implants in the future; before I would have never considered dental implants but now that I see what a gentle and professional dentist Dr. Elloway is Im on board with the idea.
If you're looking for a dentist with state of the art equipment but want a dentist with the old time personal care, then the dental office of Robert K.Elloway is the place for you.<//Review>

Simply the best Dental office in Riverside or the greater IE. I've been coming here for years and is by far the best value by far for service, cost, etc. I do only think they take PPO plans or limited HMO (Delta Dental). Thry also do special procedures, includong costemitc, night guards, and invisilign.<//text>

So disappointing to drive way out there only for them to be closed! Also they still allow for you to purchase Groupons but the establishment is closed.

<review>This is the first time I've had to walk through a metal detector at a skating rink. That was a surprise, but if they feel it's necessary then it really must be and I'm glad they are taking precautionary steps. All I know is that me and my family had the best time! They played really good music, old school and new school combined. The rink floor was clean and shiny, and well cared for. Will go again very soon!<//review><GmapID>0x809adcbe9ef6195b:0x79aa65b2db7f2c32<//GmapID>< user_id>

Love the rink. We have so much fun skating here. The music is fantastic so don't worry about having to bring earbuds or headphones. The snack bar is bomb and has all the favorites.  The crowd is diverse and friendly.  Staff is considerate and helpful. Our favorite place to skate. Wish we lived closer, we'd be here every night! Highly recommend. If you like to have fun,  this is a great place!</Review>

This place is the best. I went there a couple weeks ago and they were packed due to the Groupon. We went back today, Sunday, for "family skate" and it was amazing. They played a mix of 70's and contemporary hits. The crowd was diverse. There were skaters of all ages and skill levels. This place is amazing. My child and my inner child both had a blast.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Took a group of teens here for the 6 to 8:30pm session on a Friday night! We loved everything about it and the teens rolled away wanting to go back. It was $7 to enter and $3 skate rental or $5 blades rental. That night there was $3 spectator fee for parents and chaperones. Other than skating they have arcade games, a snack bar, and super friendly security. I would recommend The Rink for groups and individuals. Overall is was a great experience.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4A2fTwA54gLM6uiepIptSSehVK5sZkd0Z32Rn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

Great place for the kids to go and have fun. I like that the kids can skate until midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. They play good music. The sessions are just long enough to tire them out. Good old fashioned clean fun.The price per session is only $7 and skate rentals are $3. Can't beat $10 a kid. I love it!< /Review>

The owner is a sweet person, BUT the floors need to be stripped properly and cleaned if not someone is going to get seriously injured. A better DJ is needed, music is not that great. I give a two- star rating because of the owner’s great personality!< /review>

This is a nice clean skating rink, but music is way too loud, and they could use a lot more seating.  We had a birthday party for young adult son.  Party room was a bit small.  Birthday guy had fun, but...did not think it was worth the money.   Note about staff:  while not unpleasant, not 1 smiled the entire 4 hrs, all acted rather robotic.  Also, ordered icee, paid, then told machine not working properly.  Asked for refund.  Clerk went to machine and came back with a cup with half frozen icee, half icee liquid base, and said I was LUCKY, usually it wouldnt freeze at all when not working right.   Declined, again requested refund, was told no refunds-???  If you can't give me what I paid for, you have to give me my money back.  Did get a refund, but very odd.</Review>

Took my granddaughter and her friends to celebrate her turning the double digits 10, and had an awesome time. For me it brought back memories of when I was her age and I went to the skating rink. I am so glad that skating rinks are still around, but even more glad that the Rink was there and my granddaughter had a fantastic experience. Can't wait to go again..👍👍<//review>

<review>Security with a metal detector and wand, pretty crazy for a skating rink but made me feel more comfortable with the residing area and question it at the same time, staff is really friendly they all like there in high school tho, good music. Reasonable priced snack bar, the pizza has garlic in it. Asian security guard with dreads seems to has a chip in his shoulder, really should chill out. But overall good experience. Cake cutting skills on point.</review>< time>

Pretty good place to take your children. The staff were nice and helpful, the music was great and the different crowds of people were amazing. Great place to come with your family and let your hair down. What I really loved was that I was to walk my 4yr old around the rink with my shoes on. Most places do not let you.< /text>

Typical skating rink. It could use a makeover. You have to pay just to watch if you don't skate.< /Review>

<review>We had a joint birthday party at The Rink and it was great!  The kids really had a blast and it certainly made some of us nostalgic.

The staff was incredibly friendly and kept everything running smoothly (fast and easy skate rentals, concessions, and DJ for the skate rink)< /review>< pics>

I grew up in this skating rink! It brought back so many wonderful memories for me! From speed skate to limbo to learning how to skate backwards, the awesome music and happy staff. The only things that have changed are the name and there's more arcade games with tickets and prizes!< /text>

The place is c inexpensive fun for the family. They have a $3 admission fee or $6 skate rental fee which included admission.  There are arcade games, some which give you tickets you can exchange for prizes. It can be very fun. Although there is an offer that is hard to identify, but very tolerable.< /review>

Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Facilities were clean and the food was as good as you could get for the prices which were pretty low. Don't get yuppie hopes up on the lockers being in the best shape.  The Rink had an old rundown charm tho it but I personally like that.<//review>

<review>My family and I had the absolute worst experience here on 11/24/18 at 8:00pm when we went to the food court. A simple misunderstanding turned into a staff member using the “N” word and other profanity. I had to actually leave early and remove them from the unnecessarily hostile situation. My ten year old cried bc of the way the two employees acted. I made a formal complaint with the manager Tom. He was very nice and apologetic for the heathens that work there under him. I have never been so offended in my life. I regret coming here and I hope that they do something to control the immature young staff members they employ. I will be constantly following up with this and hope to speak to the owners because actions like they took against me will surely be future lawsuits. I don’t want anything refunded at all. I just want people to beware. I TRULY REGRET SPENDING A PENNY HERE. I WILL NEVER RETURN AND I WILL SPREAD THE WORD AS FAR AS IT CAN TRAVEL.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I’m coming today at 5pm! Been coming here for years, I can’t complain I love to skate, I just hate how some shoes are worn down badly and need new padding inside. Other then some new wheels or greased up wheels, and some pads, riding will be so much smoother. I love being able to walk home nicely, with out blisters but I always get them haha!< /text>

Went to see a roller derby here. What a throwback to the younger years- a skating rink!!! It's just like i remember them as a kid. (For better or worse!!). If you can support a local derby day, do it- doesn't hurt they have a full bar during derby!< /Review>

<username>Alyishia Williams</username><Review>The first time I went there it was amazing it had lots of activities that you can play. It has great quality and great game that you can play but remember it's a skating rink. Overall, it is a great place to spend time with your family and friend and most likely your relationship.

P.s  They have great music and you can request a song and they will most definitely play it, definitely old school songs 😍😍😍< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It's a fun safe place to take your kids on the weekends. The snack bar leaves a little bit to be desired, but the kids don't care.</Text>

<Review>Nice place for the family.  Some bad policies imo.  Charged for a very young girl (3 years) who wasn't wouldn't skate when there was an option for a "spectator fee"  they claim this is just for adults.  Anyhow it was a $2 problem so not enough to ruin an outing.   Can't give a 5 star however<//Review>< pics>

This place is ghetto . They steal . The manager doesn't care . He's old and has no customer service etiquette. The security is not on his job . He just stands there.   Horrible place to take young kids. It's supposed to be a family environment but instead it's a place for older teenagers to pick on younger kids.  And the adults do not supervise.  They are trash.<//text>

The food isn't very good though - we are not into over processed fast food. I usually eat before and bring a snack.

Bathrooms are small and usually messy.

Skating and song selection are good. We also enjoy the games.

They have walkers for beginners.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>This place doesn’t get too crowded and they play good music. I would say it’s a family friendly environment. Very fun even if you fall a few times you get a good laugh. Prices are fair I believe it’s $5-7? Nothing outrageous. Only minor complaint I have is that they made me remove my ballcap (hat) when I was in the rink I didn’t ask why but yeah I thought it was kinda lame but not enough to argue with the employee because they did tell me at the door lol and they asked politely.</Review></record></dataset><record>

It was HOT AS HELL in there!!!! The centralized air conditioning is NOT ADEQUATE!!! The party room is too small. On the bright side the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and the kids always have a great time.
We will return for the skating classes on Saturday mornings. But not a great place to throw a party.<//Text>

Went to my niece's birthday party. The young kids there were not sure what they were doing. They also looked very unhappy at the counter. The pizza was served very late and tasted very bad. Then, later when were were watching the kids skate, they decided to kick us and our babies out of the bench near the dj booth. They said they had to set up for another party... There was no party..music selection needed some work.</text>

<review>So the only reason why I even come to this establishment is because my daughter really loves to State however they really need to upgrade their seating their food and their packages for birthdays I feel like they should allow you to bring your own food in when booking a birthday I love going to countrylanes in Sacramento because they let you bring in your own food but they give you nice table seating that don't rush you that give you arcade game cards bowling for the kids of all ages and Laser Tag they offer so much plus they have a bar for the adults in there what a way to go to the skating ring needs to really upgraded step it out this is 2018 and their playlist is outdated stuck I was listening to when I was a kid they need to step it up< /review>< username>

It's friendly, secure and a good entertainment bargain. The music is kept up to date, which is critical for kids. The staff is friendly and keeps a watchful eye for safety. Adult night is their secret weapon and attracts ever more people who love to exercise by skating to music they grew up with. They do not offer a season pass option, which is unfortunate as that would encourage a loyal customer base, regulars who bring friends. For that, they lose one star.< /Review><Rating>4< /Rating>< UserId.>

Could very well be the only skating rink in operation in Sacramento. The only other one that comes to mind (but has since closed), was Cal Skate in South Sac. Having said that, your options are limited. Arcade games and the typical crappy tasting pizza are available. You need to go through a metal detector before coming in lol. Security is present inside, in case s#%t goes down. I do have to say though, the ice cream was surprisingly ok. Didn't like that they charge extra to rent the skating walkers.</Text>

The Rink is my favorite place to skate in all of Sacramento! They have plenty of skate sessions, so you can come late at night and skate with the grown ups if you don't want to have to worry about playing "unexpected obstacles" with all of the little kids. They also just got a new floor. It's perfect for new skaters.< /Text>

Went on a Saturday night and it was insanely busy. Very hard to enjoy skating due to all the kids zooming around cutting people off. Also a bit sketchy. Make sure to bring in cash for a locker as there are no in-and-out privileges and it's not safe to leave your shoes out.</review>

Oh nostalgia... The Rink takes me back to the days of my youth, of roller skating on the weekends with  my friends. It's a great place for kids and if you're an adult who wants to relive their youth for an hour or so.< /review>

<Text>Horrible place, horrible experience,  I seen a teenage boy touch his private then touched the water fountain! no parking, the kids that work here don’t have a clue what they are doing, I stood in line at snack bar for 30 minutes it didn’t move! adults we’re cutting in front of kids. There had no walkers left for my 4 year old to skate! the first 3 lockers didn’t work to hold my purse,  I would never come back here ever!!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I originally went to The Rink only monthly for Sac City Rollers roller derby bouts but I just went last night for their Sunday 7-9:30p open skate session and had a great time and will be coming back for more before they temporarily shut down for roof maintenance summer 2017.

Excellent music selection and requests are free. Open and welcoming staff members and patrons. It's hard to beat $5.50 for 2.5hrs of skating! Open and free parking and is handicap accessible.

The only two qualms I have with The Rink is, one, their floor - not a traditional wooden, which isn't a deal breaker, but it has seen some damage that they've attempted to fix but leaves for a textured skating surface compared to other rinks in the area. Second item of note is for when I'm photographing roller derby bouts - the giant bright orange "The Rink" on the big wall is hideous and makes for terrible photographing.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x809adcbe9ef6195b:0x79aa65b2db7f2c32< /Gmap_id>< user>

Good rink with fun games. However, I had to pay $5 for a small child that was not skating. The musty bathrooms need more work but have improved.</review>

Its always.fun but,this Rink is getting more ghetto, and black girls harassed my daughter and friend. Alot of remarks about being white As they passed my daughter and friend skating going around the rink.... This rink lets the parents drop off their kids !! Just a big daycare!! I was very disappointed.
The teenagers are off the hook!!!! no real supervision....No accountability.</text>

OML this place is the best... >.< Went with my cousin that didn't know how to skate but, since the rink was slippery it was pretty easy for her to learn. Definitely comin back soon with friends. The snack bar is a bit expensive THO.... LOWER THE PRICES!!! LOL</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>We will never return. We visited The Rink because we had a Groupon and thought it would be a fun way to spend a Saturday. The place was so dirty and the equipment is in need of replacing. The bathrooms were sticky with urine and had a terrible odor. Every surface looks filthy and the staff could care less about their jobs. It was a big disappointment.< /Review>< Pics>

This place is not safe for anyone to go to anymore. Every time we have let our daughter go for a Friday or Saturday skate, there are fights in the parking lot with all the rude and disrespectful kids and young adults and our daughter has called because she was afraid with all the violence and going on inside and people with guns outside. It has turned into a hang out for all the unsupervised kids. We will not be returning to this Rink. It's unfortunate too because it really is a nice place if there wasn't so many issues such as this.< /Text>

I went to The Rink this past weekend and woah... Woah, is all that I really have to say about this place. The outside seems ran down, and it's not exactly in the best area. I decided to go to The Rink because my friends were interested in trying out a skating rink in the area. I guess a plus, would be that it's not the hardest place to find. Parking in the parking lot is okay. The parking lot when I arrived was full of around 30-40 cars, but seemed dirty. There was cups all over the parking lot, and trash scattered. I didn't let a dirty parking lot ruin the night of fun that was about to happen. We went inside the lobby area, and I have no complaints. Was easy and pretty quick to get inside seeing as there was a line of around 15 people, they did actually get us in pretty quick. Once inside I went to their skate rack to find a pair of skates. Woah, that's the next ting! The person working at their skate counter was absolutely rude, I asked for a size 8, and it was too small. I went up to the counter to exchange the pair of skates for a size nine and they called me and idiot! Are you serious?  I got the wrong size skate so I'm an idiot.. Isn't that just what I wanted to hear today.. He said it to a buddy quietly as he was turning around, but I was able to hear. Throughout the night all I really did was skate with my friends. As much skating as we could do with all of the punk kids skating way too fast, and way too close to us. They were extremely rude and didn't care about anyone in their way. There was absolutely no enforcement of any type of safety rules, and the music they were playing was absolutely horrible for a public place. I will never be back.</Text>

<text>Overcrowded, dirty carpeted walls, obnoxious kids, inappropriate music (of course the kids like to go to The Rink for that reason), very little enforcement of rules.  You have kids skating at 45mph on inline skates right past your 10 year old.  The "owner" is also very annoying and repeatedly announces that he is "the owner" every single time we go there.  The last time I went, I overheard "the owner" yelling at a kid for having a whistle.  Enforce the rules, but don't act like a jackass and puff up to a 13 year old kid.  Then comes the annoying "because I'm the owner and I know the rules."  I refuse to go here again.  Go to the roller rink in Roseville (Riverside Ave) - it's WAY nicer and they don't nickel and dime you.  Besides, you'll be in the company of well behaved people with class.<//text><resp>None< /resp></record>

Haven't been here since it was king skate..the price now is ridiculous. Way over priced. It's 8.50 to get in plus skate rental. Would rather drive all the way to Roseville then come here ever again.<//review>
