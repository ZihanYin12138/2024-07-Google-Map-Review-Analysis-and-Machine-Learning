<review>Such friendly people here! I especially love how covid-compliant they are. Can't even touch items throughout the store, which I appreciate - you have your own personal shopper with you! I happened to have the manager as my personal shopper, and she was attentive without hovering. Let me have my space to look around and browse, but was close enough to ask questions or have her grab something to toss in my pile of goodies to purchase!
Besides the pandemic praises, I really value the staff's knowledge of various items. And I love that they carry so many locally sourced products! 10/10. You all are amazing!</review>< Gmap_id>

The employees were super patient and helpful. They did not over sell us products we didn't need. Overall just very honest in their review. The incense collection was top notch, of course you'll see better in different setting and environments but for the shop there could have been more pre packaged scents but they still hand a large selection of individual sticks of different sizes. They even allow companions in the store, well behaved and on a lead of course since its a smoke shop. Glad I took the time to visit.< /review>

<review>Been coming here since I was legal to buy pieces and got my stimulus and was ready to spend money, but to my surprise i was greeted at the door by an employee wanting me to switch my mask. Saying that "they aren't doing those masks" which was a bandana covering my nose and face.  If you don't like being hassled with covid stuff this isn't the place. On top of that they told me they had certain merchandise and when I arrived they said they only had one of each item when over the phone I was told differently. I was ready to spend like 200 bucks on new glass and stuff.  Just trying to keep my money local but I guess not here.< /review>< resp>

Neck gators and bandana's are shown by science to not be adequate protection against COVID.  We are just trying to do what is best for our staff, our customers and our community.  The fact that we have free masks available for you should at least have earned us one more star, lol.  Bottom line:  If you cannot support a small business in the community who is concerned about a deadly virus we are not the shop for you."}<//resp>

Awesome service was out of town with no gear like a fool and needed stome stuff for a beach trip and they were super patient with me trying to be cheap but ended up buying a bunch of extra stuff because so much variation of different things in the store. Free refills on certain items is awesome wish some shops in Sacramento would follow their lead. Great employee  great store made a great night.<//Text>

Highly recommend this shop🤙</Text><gmapID>0x54d3fff804f4bfb5:0x1da316c3106c424d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have loved this spot since I moved to Humboldt. Killer plants and books. Good people working there. A little overboard with the covid requirements.  Rounding up and down on change? You can't hand me nickles,dimes and quarters but dollar Bill's are fine? Lol silly<//review>

In response to your comment about paper vs coinage:  We invested in a UV-C sterilizer that we run the paper money through when received.  That way when we return paper cash it is going to have an exceptionally low risk of having living pathogens on it.  We do not have a way to do this for coinage.  We are happy to rethink this policy as time going on, but right now the risk is greater than it ever has been here in Humboldt and we would rather put safety first, even if it seems silly.'}< /resp>< gmapID>

{'time': 1597436964132, 'text': "Hello Laura.  If the piece has a manufacturer's defect you shouldn't be on the hook for that.  Sometimes it is difficult for the staff members who are not glass blowers to tell the difference between a makers flaw and normal breakage from use.  A lot of the staff are new after this COVID 19 thing so they may not have know to ask me- I appreciate that they were trying their best to apply rules that are new to them.  If you send me an email with some pics, or we can arrange to meet in person, I can further help you.  Since I have been blowing glass for a few decades I can figure out how almost all cracks formed, whether through manufacturing or use.  I will be honest and tell you if I don't think it is a makers flaw, but the way you describe what happened (it sounds like it was immediately a problem, like within a day or two) I am pretty sure it is Diamond's fault, and we will work it out with them to get you hooked up."}</Resp>

Umm... For starters, unique. Partly head shop, part gift store, and they've got a really kewl selection of incense and carnivorous plants too! Both people in the shop were super nice, and the pretty girl even shoots you with a raygun when you enter the store!

They also have a pretty kewl collection of laptop stickers and a back room with all the expensive glassware - bongs, pipes, and well known glass blowers.

Stop in just to briwe

<review>This place is awesome they have beautiful pieces in there and if you don't have all the money for the super nice expressive things that you really want they have a lay away program.
Freaking awesome I highly suggest you check them out.
Not only do they have every thing you can think of for your 420 needs they have bath bombs with all natural ingredients (my wife loves them), if you do roller derby they have all your needs for that there also a while line of CBD products, incense, beautiful glass art and pendants I highly suggest pezzleberg products (hope that is how you spell it🤭) I posted a picture of the pendent I bought of his, and many other things.</review>< Pics>

It was a great experience. Coming from Ohio I had never been in an actual smoke shop. I went in and asked for a tobacoo pipe and the cashier says we dont have those here. I look to my right as we both look at large bright display of water pipes. She then says to me " do you mean a bong?" Lol only in nor cal! Gotta love it< /text>

PLEASE CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!!! It's still my favorite place in town for vaping supplies, but they are training a bunch of new people (who still need some additional keyboarding experience) Actually paid almost $50.00 for a $15.00 bottle of vape juice! They (unlike Riverwalk & most all the rest) gave me a refund for the overcharge!</review>

While this has earned us best Vape Shop multiple years in a row, we certainly make mistakes.  Could you please tell me a little more about what happened so we can fix it?  If you suspect we were sold any counterfeit products please at least let us know what those are so we can call the manufacturer and fix the problem.  We deal with most manufacturers directly so it would be weird for this to happen, but we do buy from some warehouses too.  It doesn't happen very often but about ten years ago we were sold some fake G Pens so we know it isn't impossible."}< /Response>

Terrible experience. My wife and I went in to get her some new plugs and the lady behind the counter used this metal thing to look at the size rather than comparing them to the ones that my wife was wearing. We ended up purchasing 2 sets of wooden plugs that ended up being significantly bigger than her actual size. They said they can't even exchange them for the correct size. Worse smoke shop in Eureka hands down. Everything else is way overpriced anyways. Will not be reccommending to anyone or ever returning.< /text>

We just started carrying plugs and jewelry again so we are trying to work out the details of how to do it well. One of our problems is we are not a tattoo or piercing shop so we don't have a way to properly gauge people's existing jewelry without contaminating our gauge wheel or the new jewelry with people's ear cheese. The reason we don't take the jewelry back is once people have tried them on they could have blood, bacteria, or sluffed skin cells, or even hepatitis B (which can live for weeks outside of the body) on it. That wouldn't be ethical to then sell to someone else. The employees are doing a good job of enforcing the rules as they are.  If you would have messaged me I am sure we could have worked something out, but since you are upset enough to blast us on every platform I agree that we are no longer compatible. I will still take your critiques to heart and try to come up with better policies if we continue to carry jewelry.  And I truly am sorry.  I hate getting bad customer service.  It can ruin my entire day so I really do understand."}< /Resp></record>

They have a full line of CBD, E nails, silicone rigs, Hemp blunt wraps,  so much more products and an extreme amount of knowledge. You guys really made my trip complete.

We don't have any of the super cheap stuff right now because we tried it about a year ago and a staff member who is very familiar with the product got nauseated and didn't get any good effect.

-that’s a ridiculously high price for kratom.I have never seen somebody charge so much money for that product.
It’s one thing to upsell something it’s another thing to lie to somebody right to their face.Not cool.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Kate THE Great...this one is for you!!!!!  OK so I've always loved this place and everyone there has always been really really helpful and knowledgeable. 5 stars for everyone...but Kate has on more than a few occasions spent a lot of time and patience educating me on how devices work. I've recently tried to start up vaping to quit smoking cigs and have had some really bad luck with leaky mods. She's tried troubleshooting one's I didn't even buy there ( regrettably because they have the best customer service around) and when all else failed recommended one that was more suitable to my needs and so far has worked perfectly. Thanks a bunch for your time and help!!!<//text>

I’m new to vaping and I came in to S.T.I.L because I was having a problem
with my Voopoo Drag Mini giving me a “check atomizer” message repeatedly after my first time putting in a new coil.

Here I’ll inject how I could make this review unnecessarily long(er) by going into my many less than optimal  experiences of visiting several other local shops for help. I’ll leave it at that.

Anyway, after much YouTube research and taking the tank apart and putting it back together I was still stymied.

We were in Eureka and dropped by S.T.I.L. I liked the friendly vibe as soon as we walked in. I explained my predicament and THREE employees came right over to help - then politely asking to take it in back to have a look at it. 3 minutes later they came back with a working mod.

I was truly impressed. They were super nice about it and I’d actually wanted to pay them for their time but they waved it away. We didn’t feel pressured to buy anything and so we purchased $75 worth of more fun vape stuff!

The next day I thought I’d try changing to a different coil ...just because....
Then Again! “check atomizer”. Ugh

So I called S.T.I.L. They remembered me though they’d actually had two people come in with that very same problem. They told me what they did to fix it but said if I couldn’t to please feel free to come back in and have them do it.
I fixed it.

Even though we live in Mckinleyville we will are willing to travel to Eureka just to buy from S.T.I.L. Their friendly helpful customer service is very much appreciated. And the shop is well stocked too!<//text>

In the past I have enjoyd the environment.. my last experience left me not wanting to ever return. They let random musitions play racist and secular music.. after the music played I purchased music for the juke box (app) and shortly into the song the staff (Mgnt) stopped the song I PURCHASED and played a woman bashing song... I dont think my co-workers and myself will return.< /Review>

Nice stuff, but bad service. ALWAYS make them double check the sizes on ear gauges because when they sell you mismatched pieces or the size isn't what they advertise, they will do absolutely nothing to make it right.<//review>

{'time': 1534268732963, 'text': "We are very sorry to hear that we missed the mark on the item you bought.  We try very hard to have the newest and best, but sometimes we end up paying too much from distributors or vendors which means we put the item out at too high of a price and don't realise it.  Sometimes the prices of items drop very fast in our industry (like mods) and we don't catch the drops in time to correct the price.  Could you please contact us and let us know what the items is and what the appropriate price should be so we don't make this mistake again?  Thank you for taking the time to review us and giving us this valuable feedback.   -Jason"}<//Resp>

{'time': 1477605253571, 'text': "Hello.  We are sorry to hear about your experience.  We take fair pricing very seriously, regularly dropping prices as soon as we can.  There are areas of the store though, such as vapes and mods, that often drop faster than we can realize it.  We have seen the 'cool new vape' go from over 200 dollars down to 80 in just a few months.  We have also seen knock-offs drop the market even faster by scamming people on line and at discount stores.  So we apologize if we were not on top of our game with your vape.\n\nIn the future we welcome you to let us know in the store when we have an item at too high a price.  We regularly review our customer feedback and take action so we can continue to be Humboldt's #1 Headshop :)  (NCJ 2016)"}</response>

<review>Absolute best experience I have ever had with an eye doctor for my daughter! Even for him being out of network on our insurance I would definitely go to him again because I would pay to see him again! We were visiting town and he took my daughter as a walk in and dilated her eyes for the exam and was so helpful at explaining everything! It was so quick, It was definitely an amazing experience and would highly recommend him. His staff was very helpful as well!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Dr. Kim was very attentive to my needs and we had two follow up appointments to find the best contact lens fit for me. Will definitely be coming back in the future. I called around beforehand to ask about prices and this was the most affordable price when getting both a glasses and contact lens prescription so that’s a great bonus!< /Review>< pictures>

Ms. Peggy and Megan are wonderful as well. There are good vibes all around as soon as you walk through the door.<//Review>< Name>

They made their experience joyful and comfortable. The doctor was very thorough and recommended products that would help improve my tired vision and my daughters allergies. They had numerous glasses within budget of my insurance coverage. I loved that the doctor emailed me after my appointment with a recap of our conversation.

<Text>I have greatly enjoyed my entire experience with Clear Sight. From the moment Meghan's friendly voice greeted me on the phone, I knew this would be a place that valued the customer experience. Dr Kim was punctual and even got me in a little before the appointment time. He was quick and thorough in the exam, yet his friendly demeanor meant it never felt rushed or impersonal. The office assisted in selecting my frames and fitting them once they arrived, which only took a week! All-in-all, wonderdul experience; I'll be back and suggest anyone looking for an optometrist visit Dr Kim.< /Text>< pics>

WOW!!!! I was looking for a new place for glasses and contacts and after seeing many post about Dr. Kim, I gave Clear Sight a call on Monday afternoon. I got a call from Megan by 10:30 Tuesday morning. She had apt. available same day, which didnt work but also afternoon apt. Today (Wednesday). My apt was 2:30, I arrived at 2:26, was promptly greeted with the standard health history form to fill out. I was walked back immediately after filling out form and pre-exam began.
I was then seen by Dr. Kim who was waiting for me, not bouncing from patient to patient. Dr. Kim is amazing! I have dealt with red eyes and discomfort for years with nothing ever working. He offered a long term  resolution to the inflammation,  which I was happy to purchase. He did his exam, and did not push buying anything. I told him, i wanted a back up pair of glasses in addition to my contacts. He introduced me to Peggy, who was a sweetheart and gave me all my options. I had frames ranging from 135-350 and it didn't matter to her what I bought. She gave me a breakdown of what I asked for, no pushy upsale of this coating and that coating. She asked, what I wanted.
All in all, I was in and out in an hour, had multiple options for glasses, going to look back through my photos to see which I like best, AND my eyes are clear again! Long post, I know but Dr. Kim and his staff are EPIC and would highly recommend Clear Sight Optometry any day.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I recently just moved to the area and had to find a new Optometrists. I chose Clear Sights because of how many amazing reviews they had, and let me tell you, they did not disappoint. From the moment I stepped into the office, I felt extremely welcomed. Not only did the front desk greet me, but Dr. Kim was also in the front office to welcome me himself. They checked me in and brought me back right away. One of the girls (I didn't get a chance to get her name) brought me back and while she was getting my eye measurements and all the basic stuff, we were chatting and laughing. She is extremely kind and personable. Once it was time to do my vision test, Dr. Kim came in and introduced himself. He was very professional and you can tell he truly cared about what is best for his patients and that he was not there just to make money. He answered all of my questions that I had and communicated with me what he was doing every step. I felt very comfortable in the office, and I am glad that I found such an amazing Optometrist.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Dr. Kim did a great job assessing my vision needs and even told me about reading glasses, which I didn't know could help. Usually I only have contacts and back up glasses, but given how much time I am on the computer for work, he was able to give me a 3rd prescription for reading glasses that could help with blue light. I don't live in the country, so having a reliable optometrist I can go to annually gives me peace of mind. Definitely recommend!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This place saved my vacation today! I left home without my contacts, and I'm practically blind! I called them up at 8:58am and had contacts in my hands by 9:15! I come to Temecula all the time, and refer to it as my "Happy Place", so Clear Sight Optometry is located in the right city! Thank you guys for your efficiency and great service to your tourists! 😁<//Review>

Dr. Kim was really friendly and knowledgeable, he verbally walked me through each test as he performed them and made it a point to address any and all my questions.

Clear Sight had a great selection of frames and sunglasses--I ended up purchasing a pair of sunglasses that I love.

Overall, service was personable and efficient yet thorough.

The office is modern, clean, and very conveniently located--will definitely be returning.</review>

The contact lens/glasses exam process from the start to finish was very quick and friendly! Dr.Kim was straight forward, knew exactly what I needed, and provided me with alternate ways to get what I needed as well. They also accommodated a last minute appointment, which was a huge plus for me.<//text>

A few weeks back I started feeling a strange sensation in my right eye, it was red and extremely sensitive to light.

Having been visited Dr. Kim in the past for glasses, I was confident he would know what was causing my symptoms.
I contacted his office and was immediately scheduled for a same day appointment. The staff was friendly and very accommodating.

At the time of my appointment the staff quickly took action and started the Pre-examination process, testing my eye pressure, my peripheral vision and more with very sophisticated machines. ( I was very impressed)

Not even 30 seconds after my pre-examination, Dr. Kim introduced himself and led me into his examination room for a diagnosis.  He was very calm, friendly, courteous and competent. He explained the diagnosis and set forth a plan of action to treat my condition.

Do to the severity of my condition he scheduled follow up visits (daily) to insure I was making progress; thats quality service in my book. The treatment was successful and I give Dr Kim and his staff 10/5 stars on all fronts.

I without a doubt highly recommend the Dr. Kim And his staff for their professionalism, and service excellence.<//Text>

I would recommend Dr. Kim and definitely will only go back to him I went somewhere else and they did my eye exam and gave me the wrong prescription I went to Dr. Kim and he knew something was off he redid my eye exam and fixed it so I have a sharper image. I also went back and got contacts and he was patient and polite throughout the whole contact training process. I’d definitely recommend Clear Sight Optometry</text>

< Review>
Dr. Kim and his staff are awesome !
I came to the office because I had a really bad eye irritation, other places did not want to see me because they needed an approval from my insurance, even though my insurance said to let them know it was urgent. I did go to the urgent care but it was not much help. I came to Dr. Kim based on the great reviews, he took me in the same day I called, he took care of my irritation and did an eye exam as well. Since my eye exam I have visited his office a few more times with my kids and their experience has also been awesome. I recommend Dr Kim to anyone !!!< /Review>

<text>Dr. Kim is an excellent optometrist! Everyone in the office is so kind and helpful with everything that it's always a pleasure to go in. Booking an appointment time that's convenient for you is very easy and they don't keep you sitting around and waiting like some other offices do (which is nice). I personally have very finicky eyes and I had quite a few questions and concerns to speak about with Dr. Kim which made me a little nervous, but he was very attentive and addressed them all with patience and a smile. The prescription I had before was too high and I had a whole bunch of issues going on that are now fixed thanks to him. Also, he gave me options that were tailored for my specific needs/wants which was nice. He's an all around great guy who actually cares about his patients and what he does (he's an excellent optometrist). I highly recommend paying him a visit if your having any eye related issues.<//text><Response>{'time': 1512495982684, 'text': "Wow. Thank you for such an AWESOME review.

Professional and expert. I had a problem with my eye glasses which my old doctor told me there’s no need to change it but I still have a headache & eyes pain but when I came here the doctor said there’s a big change happened in your glass descriptions it’s not the same like before and now I’m better. So please before you choose any doctor look up online first and see the reviews like I did thank you .</Text>

Everyone needs a mechanic, plumber, lawyer, dentist, physician, and optometrist you can trust. With Dr. Kim, you get to check one off this list. I did my research and he trained at one of the top schools in the country, is very experienced, and also has a great personality. He uses top of the line equipment but doesn't charge you an arm and a leg. Will refer all my friends and family here!<//Text>

<text>. Dr. Kim did my eye exam, but didn't tell me anything about whether my vision was worsening, or if the results from the tests were positive or negative. I just told him my eyes get dry sometimes, and he took that information and tried selling me more expensive specialty contact lenses. I really wanted to see a doctor to make sure my eyes were healthy as I had scarring in the back of my eye and he didn't even mention anything except for that I needed to come back in a week after trying out the new contacts. I had to ask him what my prescription was because all he was talking about was buying contacts from him during the entire exam. He mentioned that my current lenses, Aquacomfort Dailies, were subpar to the specialty lenses which are $100 a box as opposed to my usual $60. I kept feeling like he was trying to sell me. When I asked how much it would be to order them through him, I was first upfront by saying "I normally order online and use the prescription you give me because I've gotten a better price." And he continues to scoff, "Well we'll definitely beat their prices because we have rebates." Peggy, his other associate, was trying to say it would cost $490 out of pocket and I could hear him in the back asking her, "Are you sure about this price?" Making me feel even more unconfident in their establishment. I told him it usually comes down to price for me, so I didn't want to leave without knowing the cost comparison, so I can make an informed decision, try out the contact samples he gave me and decide whether to come back or order online. He then said, "Well can I have those samples back then?" with an attitude, grabbing at my hands. He then asked, "How are you going to get a rebate when you buy online?" I've never had an issue with an optometry's front desk giving me the rebate as a patient of theirs! Instead, he tried to use it as a selling tactic to force me to make a decision with him. I started crying because he made me feel like I was wasting his time or not worth his time, which is unfair considering I paid a $60 lense fitting and he billed my Kaiser and UNH insurance (which he said it took a long time to figure out the cost of the contacts because of my insurance, and I said "Why is it bad?", and he said "honestly, yes"). He then tried to talk nicer as he could realize I was upset, and finally gave me my prescription receipt. I am a 22 year old female, and from the outside it could appear like you could pressure and take advantage of me. I felt like he was trying to intimidate me, thinking I would trust what he was doing even if it wasn't in my best financial interest. I've never had the doctor also be the check-in person, the billing person and the ordering person. Maybe he's a little overstretched. I understand he has a family and makes money off of the products he sells, but I'm 21 weeks pregnant and $500 for upgrading my contacts requires a lot of contemplation as I'm starting my new family. Instead of empathizing with my concerns, he made me feel minimized for having them. The biggest suggestion I can make is to just do your job, be the doctor, be thorough in your examination, ask me if I'm wearing proper eye wear, how often I wear contacts or glasses... not if I'm willing to spend more for better contacts. Let the other people do their jobs. It's hard to trust a doctor who's acting as a salesperson. If you care about honesty, transparency, your health and pricing... I wouldn't come here. Unless you're okay with being directed without getting to ask questions and less being belittled then just go somewhere that has an office with professional staffing.<//text><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

Dr. Arthur Kim is by far the kindest, caring, and efficient optometrist I've ever had. From the office, to the staff, and the exam, everything was smooth, friendly, and welcoming. When I picked up my glasses, I could tell that I paid well for quality frames and lenses. I'm definately bringing my friends and family here to this office! Thanks Dr. Kim!</text>

Clean clean clean.  Modern optometrist, state of the art equipment.  Friendly staff.  They accepted my VSP insurance, only paid $140 for my exam and year supply of contact lenses.  Exam to less than 30 mins and I was on with my day.  I highly recommend this place for your optometrist needs.</review>

<Review>So much of healthcare has gone corporate and I’m realizing it’s not a great thing for us patients, other than maybe convenience or $99 specials.   I used to go to Walmart, or Lens Crafters, or Costco for years just to get my contacts/glasses renewed. I would always see a different person on shift and always felt pretty rushed.  It was fine for a while but I never knew that I was actually supposed to be getting dilated exams yearly!  Come to find out at even the young age of 36 I actually may have glaucoma and this may never have been detected without a proper retinal exam.  I was so impressed with Dr. Kim.  He is knowledgeable and experienced but also reassuring.  He actually takes the time to know me as an individual.  I have decided to stop going to shopping malls for my eyes.  They’re important enough for you to do some research and find a qualified doctor like Dr. Kim.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>For those of you waiting until it is safe to get your dental work done. NOW is the time and THIS is definitely THE PLACE! (And, why can I only give 5 stars?!?!?!)    :)
Not only is the entire team 100% qualified, friendly, & helpful, but, they are also 100% committed to making each visit the best, most painless, & SAFEST dental visit EVER!
They've got the "covid protocols" down pat. From the second you walk in the door (spacing & plexiglass guards & face masks, etc.) through the treatment too (air purifiers, full protective gear, hand sanitizers, mouth rinse, etc.).
I had an emergency root canal in Jan (prior to me getting the vaccine) and they went out of their way to make sure I not only felt safe but WAS safe! I went back for my cleaning after I got my vaccine in April. And, now, I've gotten a failing crown fixed in May.
Seriously, if it is time (or past time) to get your dental work done, DO IT. Don't forget that healthy teeth help make a healthy you too.
This is the dental practice I've gone to since moving to CA. I've lived in four other states. This practice is the most up-to-date with the best techniques of ANY I've been to. And, to keep improving during the pandemic??? OUTSTANDING!!!!! (Can you tell I think very highly of them all?)  :)<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x808ff27d5edd86c9:0x9121ae2118e1a95b< /Gmap_id>< userid>

Dr. Deol and his staff cannot be beat. They are very welcoming!!  they check on you periodically while you’re in the chair to see if you’re doing alright. Dr. Deol makes his own crowns right there in the office so you never walk out with a temporary.   He has a pleasant and caring chair side manner!!  They follow all COVID-19 protocol. Heck, Dr. Deol even diagnosed my sleep apnea! And right he was! Dr. Deol bought my former dentist’s practice and I thought nuts I’m gonna have to find a new dentist!  well I put things off and much to my great pleasure I didn’t have to find a new dentist,  he found me!

You will never be disappointed if you choose Dr. Deol and his staff, they are amazing!!!!!<//Review>

<text>My great appreciation to Dr. Deol and his team.
They are extremely professional people. It is very clear that they love what they are doing and doing the best possible job.

I had a problem with my teeth and they scheduled an inspection the same day I called. And the treatment was done in the next two days. Everything is done in-house. The equipment is very cool and cutting edge.
I can not rate any lower than 5 starts - everything was excellent.
Thank you!<//text>< Pics>

Dr Deol has been my dentist for almost 5 years and not only is he great at what he does, but he is also a kind friend; such a great person to talk to.
Mrs Sadat, a recent hygienist just joined the team, is also a pro at what she does. My other family members have also recently decided to have Dr Deol as their dentist.<//Text>

Not a patient...yet. Had an emergency, they made room for me during holiday season, got me in, patched me up, discussed long term options, and sent me on my way. Helped make an uncomfortable situation much more tolerable.< /Review>

<review>The staff is always warm and friendly. Dr. Deol is very knowledgeable and looks at your condition from many medical angles. Cleanings are always quick and easy with a minimal amount of discomfort. Due to the COVID situation they go almost overboard with precautions to keep everyone safe from infection. I highly recommend Oak Ridge Dental.<//review>< pics>

Let me start with, I am a total wimp when it comes to going to a dentist. But Dr. Deol and staff has always made my visits very comfortable and at easy. The office has great and new technology with very convenient times available for us working people since they are open as early as 7 am to 7 pm in the evening.. I definitely know I am great hands when it comes to my dental health. So thank you Oak Ridge Dental. 🤗< /review>

<review>Very rarely do I see doctors with passion and love for what they practice and how they "treat" (both for the condition and the patient), and I experienced it first hand with Dr. Rashpal Deol.

He is considerate and truly exceptional. I had consulted him first for a severe toothache infection (needing root canal) as a  walk in patient. His staff at the front end took effort to reach Doctor Deol and despite he being very busy that day was kind enough to see me and I fixed an appointment first thing on monday morning. Unfortunately my condition worsened with indescribable excruciating pain over the weekend. Despite his family needs He personally opened the clinic and attended to my condition empathizing my pain. This was such a kind act on his part. Truly I am blessed to have him as my dentist.

I am now going to get my entire family registered for checkups with Dr  Deol and He will the doctor I will refer to my friends.<//review>< time>

I had two fillings today and while one can never say a dental experience is wonderful, it was the best I have ever experienced. Dr. Deol was very considerate during the whole process, asking if I was comfortable, asking me to let him know if there was any discomfort.  He did two fillings and the process did not seem to take very long. Numbing is never plesant, but he uses new technology one of which is called "the wand" where he is able to numb only one tooth instead of your whole mouth. . When the treatment was done, I felt pretty good. Definitely a very good experience. A great dentist that I would highly recommend to everyone.< /Text>

The exam was thorough -over 1 hour but not high pressure
Hygienist was amazing
She even put numbing gel on my gums because my teeth are so sensitive
I would recommend this dental practice

Recently I developed a horrible tooth ache on a Friday evening
Dr Deol came in on Saturday just for me a did an emergency root canal
I left town on Sunday for 9 days
He is the best dentist
He does root canals and dental implants

Wonderful dentist
Everyone remembers my name

Half-way decent pizza hole with some other stuff and limited beer selection.  Prices are good.  $18 for an 18" pie with 1 topping.  We got the inflation beater which included 1-18" large pizza with one topping, 6 garlic breads, 1-family style spaghetti, and 1-family size salad all for $32.  This was enough food for the whole family and we had a little extra to take home.  As far as quality of food goes... Well, it wasn't amazing by any means.  The sauce was bland but not bad.  The pizza was good.  Salty, greasy and authentic house made pizza with real cheese (although light).  The salad was fresh, although the tomatoes were not ripe.  The short of it, I would go again.  Not great, but good.<//review>

Crust was a little thin on the bottom (I prefer it thicker, but that's just my own personal taste), but it was thick and bready on the edges, which is perfect for me, and had a great flavor. I have a hard time finding a good thick crust pizza, and if that's your thing, you'll enjoy this place :)< /Text>

The antipasto salad was terrible. It had CANNED mushrooms and the salad was brown and wilted. The pastrami sandwich needs more meat. The atmosphere was uninviting as i waited for my food. I've met the owner and when he's there everything is better. Unfortunately I don't know his schedule so I just won't be going back.</review>

Stop there 1/2/2020.  OUCH. When we walked in the place was empy and very few lights on.  Many of the things on the memu have been crossed off. It took them a long time to fix our order.  When we started to eat it is when we noticed the crust was way to thick and was burned to a black black color.  This place is no longer good. I would say find a differemt place to eat<//Review>

My little one loved running the walkways but I was disappointed in the lack of upkeep of the play structure and the flooring. It seems they have removed all the slides and resorted to plywood and chains to block things off. I wouldn’t call this ADA accessible anymore with the woodchips filling in the missing sections of floor. Plenty of parking and lots going on at this park, would love to see it fixed up!</text>

<review>Well organized program for kids ! I love here because they have a fitness room. $10 will give you access to use it per month 💪👏🎉. I like the summer program "very cheap" from 8 to 12 your kid will be doing something proactive and also educational. I love my community 🌹❤✌🎉📣</review>< Date>

<date>1573798449834</date><Rate>3< /Rate><review>Great setup but not too sure about the direction in regards to the kids.  There seems to be no supervision. Lots of kids but only two adults who clearly couldn't be in all the the places they were in. The kids run around like crazy, boys chasing girls into the girls' bathroom, flirting, screaming. The activity rooms with kids of different ages and no one watching. I hope I'm wrong but I didn't like what I saw in the few minutes I was there.  I'm sure for parents it's of great help but for the kids, it doesn't  seem very structured.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809012e2aac1a01b:0x2f877715616dc478</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I like this center it looks very fun to work there, but it's crazy how if you even want to volunteer and even as an employee you must get fingerprinted and then they say that could take up 2 to 3 months for your results to come back. Now that is just redonkulous.... Smh< /text>

Usually I am reluctant to trying new places with new foods, but this place blew it out of the water. The workers were very nice and the place was very clean. Everything I tried in my bowl was very good. I highly recommend this place for seafood lovers. Or if you want to get out of your comfort zone.</text>

<text>Chop Chop is really good but the prices have gone up and the portions have got smaller. The key to a good business is consistency and when visiting Chop Chop it's different every time.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Fresh and delicious! Create your poke bowl with a bunch of options.  Like a chipotle or subway but without that corporate taste. I had spicy tuna,  seared tuna and salmon it was so yum. If you check in on Yelp you can get a free drink so I tried both the cucumber and mint lemonade.  Definitely recommend for all those sushi lovers out there.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Extremely knowledgeable of the items and flavors, she made great suggestions and made my bowl exactly to my liking even tho I’m complicated. Will definitely return and I suggest Alexius one hundred percent !< /Review>< Rating>

<review>So we went earlier this week and we were very unimpressed. As soon as we walked in the smell was over bearing of days old fish. My husband actually was sick later on that night from the food. But the staff is amazing ! Very friendly and answered any/all of our questions.</review>< Pics>

<review>Lots of great sauces and toppings! If you like Japanese food, this place is a must. My favorites are yellowtail, seared ahi, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, and ginger with any combo of other stuff added. Staff is also very nice!</review>< pictures>

Me and my boyfriend love this place. The staff is friendly and always have awesome suggestions when you are looking to try something new. We usually go in or do take out at least once a week. It's fresh, affordable, and always tastes good. We need more places like this in the hanford and Lemoore area.< /Text>

My first time coming here was not the best but hey I thought let me give it another chance . Let me just say I don’t know if the employees profile you or something because as we were walking in we got this weird almost “what are you doing here “ look  no greeting nothing we stood in line and the girl who was suppose to take our order walked away so that was awkward because nothing was even said to us ? The worse part is that right after we walked in another person walked in and they were all over them at that time my friend and I just walked right out of there ! Why stand there & not even get attended ?! Rude !</text>

<Text>Finally! I’ve been waiting for this place to open. Delicious deconstructed sushi bowls for your health conscious sushi consumer. Huge portions with unlimited toppings—you can’t beat it. Customer service has been great as well.

Couple critiques for improvement: your salmon and tuna are cut rather largely. Smaller cubes make for a more pleasant chewing experience. Free imitation crab as a meat would be nice. Pokiland in Fresno offers it for those who can’t eat raw fish.

Other than that, this is an excellent place that offers something different from your typical restaurants in Handord.<//Text><rate>4<//rate><Gmap_id>0x8094c3ed598ee9c7:0xdce36de9f614a81e<//Gmap_id><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Excellent food w/great pricing & service. Has a very nice down home country atmosphere. Very quaint & the help makes 1 feel as if your visiting family being & served by your Aunt Millie !! The place doesn't seem to be very big from the exterior, but, once inside you'll find, to your surprise enough room for about 10-11 tables in the front w/an additional area in the rear w/approximately 8-10 tables moderately sized. 2, or 3 tables for 2 & the rest tables for 4 w/an option & room for tables to be put together seating 8 very comfortably. My 1st time visit & won't be my last.< /Review>

I had a ham and cheese omelet with hash browns and white toast.  The omelet was   fluffy with plenty of diced ham and yellow cheese. The hash browns were golden brown.  The food looked perfect and tasted as good as it appeared. The portions were generous and filled me up. The toast was thick and delicious with and without jam. The restaurant was well arranged and clean and the coffee full bodied.  The staff was great and walked proudly in what I suspect was the confidence of working in such an ideal environment.<//text>

Food was not to bad same price as a big food chain biscuits was  a little on the dry side gravy was home made that was a plus eggs was good hashbrowns too now on the other hand the BACON was  way over cooked to the point it was jerky and the coffee was just warm..
I think I would try this place again for lunch and then review it again..</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN530hZWuXqTQ1M-eNcma-vFcd1wUROfkKbW70B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4UkkehOmqx_X0MOgwVKLZY1Rl6C8Uc0GDbG3m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80916b78066de27f:0xb6287adbc003db08<//Gmap_id></record>

The front part of the restaurant was filled with Nik naks, just like Grannys house. Then theres a back part of the restaurant which is called Granny's backyard. I cant speak to the backyard because we didnt go there. But the front is adorable!! They even have tables placed in the front windows with adorable paper in the background. It's a real life store front.

The food was very good!!! The fruit cup was fresh, the hashbrowns were soft and golden. The corned beef hash was good well.

We also ordered a waffle, which was fantastic!! I do not like waffles at all and this waffle melted in my mouth and tasted like yummy vanilla!!!

This is a must try and we will definitely be going back.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great home style look and feel. The waitress had an honest and great recommendation.
Service was Swift, food hot and good, without being pushy or rushed.
Great place to meet for the first time, or join a friend for coffee.
A definite must try.< /review>

<Review>Service was good; Staff was attentive and polite. Food came out promptly unfortunately the meal was not good.  The biscuit was under cooked and the gravy was the wrong color like it was cooked too long. The bacon was a burnt mess.</Review>< rate>

You can’t find a place like this nowadays.  A landmark breakfast spot that tastes and feels like you drove over to Granny’s house for breakfast.</review>

Excellent family restaurant with all the classic dishes you can think of. Coffee and biscuits and gravy are my regulars here when I have a chance to stop in, but if you're hungry enough you can't go wrong with any other options.<//Review>

Sit all the way in the back on a saturday morning, so quite if you're the only ones in there. And the building...must have been built in the 20s.<//text>< Date>

< Review>
This is like going to grandmas house for breakfast and lunch. A homestyle menu with really friendly servers. Granny is so funny and charming and the British accent makes her a gem. She makes a point to meet you and then when you come back she sits and chats with you and makes you laugh and feel like family. The soup, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfasts are hearty and always hot. I love the little loaf of bread you get with a bowl of soup. The ingredients are quality and the menu has a good variety to choose from. Excellent biscuits and gravy!</Review>

The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. It looks like we arrived after the busy time because there were a lot of people leaving. Everyone seemed to know each other and some customers said "see you tomorrow" when they left so I assume it is serves a lot of the same crowd in the mornings.< /review>< username>

< Review>
The pancakes melt in your mouth,  they are heavenly!  Since the first time my husband and I went to granny's pantry, (3 weeks ago)  we have not missed Sunday breakfast before church here.  We even took my in-laws from Oregon there and my mother in law said it was the best French toast she's ever had.  I will literally cry if this place ever closes.  Granny is hilarious,  so sweet,  and I don't know how they get our food out so fast,  but it's always hot and delicious.  YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE! If I could give 100 stars I would!< /Review>

I've been going here for breakfast since I was a kid. I love this place, food is great and service is fast. Make sure you visit it from time to time. Lets make sure this place stays open, there isn't a lot of little places like this left in Atwater.</review>

One of the better places to eat in Atwater for brunch.  The staff members are very nice but can be a little forgetful sometimes about refills but you definitely feel welcomed at this place.  Be careful your clothes will smell like bacon when you leave.<//Text>

Terrible service coupled with little space makes a bad experience. Waited over an hour and didn't get offered a refill on our drinks. Ended up just leaving and going to Brooks Ranch down the street. Much better service here and much faster.<//Text>

This location is consistently not quite as friendly as others, but the coffee is made well! I got an Americano and it is exactly as I expected.

This is a good location! It's just not quite a great one.</Text>

Consistently have issues with the simplest of orders. I have spoken to the manager, whom was of zer0 help, the district manager was nice, but also of little help, so now I have the regional managers cell phone number. And guess what...still terrible!</review>

Small but clean and efficient store. Its not a drive thru but sure gets people in and out quick. Small cafe seating space but good amount of seating with outlets available. Very friendly staff. Free parking lot with plenty of other free parking in the plaza. Located in plaza with Pavilions and Wendys.<//Review>

<review>It's new, it replaced a landmark Tom's burgers that served breakfast lunch and dinner inside, this place is going to break the parents bank come the end of the school year, and their kids will be addicted to caffeine before they graduate high school and forget how to make some themselves. already more drive thru than patrons. I avoid it, it was set there for the kids...like a cig shop back in the 60's and 70's when smokes were sold to anyone.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I always order a chai tea latte and Danny the Barista, always does it exactly the way I like my latte, 7 pumps andextra extra extra HOT.  All other starbucks lose in comparison to this Starbucks location. This Barista is the best over all the other starbucks locations, irwindale no good. They are not pros.<//review>

< Review>
I was just there and ordered the new Hazelnut macchiato for the first time.  When the barrista gave it to me it didn't look "mixed".  I ask her Brittany I think they didn't want to give me her name.  I wonder why! She said that I needed to order it "upside down", so I told her that is the way I want it. She grab it, dumped it and made a new one, then said now I know how to order it next time VERY RUDE, didn't even thank me after if said thanked her! If she is having a bad day ok, just don't take it out on the customers! Do we have to PAY for rudeness?  THIS WILL BE MY LAST TIME TO AT THIS STARBUCKS. Will also be posting this to YELP so everyone knows how bad this Starbucks is!</Review>

Staff cannot even make coffee.  Too many times I have waited in long line to order a coffee.  Yes plain coffee to be told we need to make the coffee.  If you cannot even make coffee at a coffee house then how did you get hired..< /Review>

Car accidents are attracted to that corner be warned and be careful. I've seen both restaurants crashed into on the opposite corners. I've seen over 30 accidents in that intersection.</review>

Dumpy little gas station.  Only one way in but no signs to let you know.  Cheaper gas than surrounding stations.  Don't think I would stop here alone at night.</text>

It's a gas station, with rats and drinks. They give no bags for purchase. Also, they Do not provide any handicap assistance  at all, and have a posted declaration  stating this. Wow!!!!<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><name>Travis Leak<//name><Pics>None</Pics><Review>So,

I Called To See If Their Law Firm Handles Discrimination Cases,

But They Said "They Do Not Handle Discrimination Cases, They Only Handle Helping Workers Get Paid."

Then I Said, So, You Handle Worker's Compensation Cases?

They Said "No We Don't Handle Compensation Cases."

I Stated " If A Worker Doesn't Get Paid Then It's Compensation."

They Said "Yes, We Handle Compensation Cases."

So, This Law Firm Is Not Educated Enough To Represent Anyone.< /Review>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) Jessica Yamane never returned my green card to immigration so that they would forward it to my address and not hers, all because she wanted me to send her a check made out to the breed for $ 25 ... it costs her nothing to return the mail for getting to the wrong Place ... very bad service ...
I want the supervisors to contact me so I can fix this situation and change my review too!
Edit: Jessica no longer works for La Raza.
Carl Larsen, he was very kind to contact me, they sent me my card and they apologized for the inconvenience.
So I have exchanged one star for 4 stars ...

(Original)
Jessica Yamane nunca regresó mi green card a inmigración para que ellos me la reenviaran a mi dirección y no a la de ella, todo por que quería que le mandara un cheque a nombre de la raza por $25... nada le cuesta regresar el correo por llegar al Lugar equivocado... muy mal servicio...
Quiero que los supervisores me contacten para poder arreglar ésta situación y así cambiar mi reseña también!
Edit: Jessica ya no trabaja para la Raza.
Carl Larsen, fue muy amable al ponerse en contacto conmigo,  me enviaron mi tarjeta y se disculparon por el inconveniente.
Así que he cambiado una estrella por 4 estrellas...< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The lawyers are friendly but they have such bitter receptionists and if you call they never answer and if you leave messages they never call you back to help you. Those receptionists are very believing and if they knew that thanks to all of us they have a job at least they should be more friendly and answer the phone or return calls when they leave a message.

(Original)
Los abogados son amables pero tienen unas recepcionistas tan amargadas y si llamas ellas jamas contestan y si dejas mensajes jamás te devuelven la llamada para ayudarte. Esas recepcionistas se creen mucho y si supieran que gracias a todos nosotros ellas tienen trabajo por lo menos deberían ser más amables y contestar el teléfono o regresar las llamadas cuando se les deja mensaje.< /text>

I was able to order a hard to find lung health supplement.  When it ordered, it was shipped right away.  I had no hassles with this company.  I'm glad I was able to find this supplement.  I didn't think anyone sold it anymore.  I plan to continue to do business with HerbsPro.</Text>

Placed an order on Oct 26, 20.

Received items on Nov 21, 20.

Used shampoo found out all 4 bottles of shampoo contained unknown shampoo. Spoke to customer service received return label on Nov 30, 20. No explanation about giving me counterfeit shampoos.
I was told that all their items are genuine.

Herbspro sent me an email says “ Received returned item, will refund my money in 7 business days on Dec 8,20.

Herbspro customer service replied to my inquiry that they “ have issued full refund “ On Jan 2, 21.

Herbspro customer service replied to my inquiry, they cannot issue refund due to their “technical glitch “ and “ just wait for my refund “ on Jan 7, 21.
I filed dispute transaction to my credit card company and submitted all correspond emails, proof of shipped back items, I received temporary refund from my credit company on Jan 8, 21.

Herbspro’s refund showed up on my statement on Jan 11, 21.

My favorite shampoo’s color * Alba Shampoo is clear and smell like coconut. Whatever shampoo they sent me had white color and did not smell like coconut, although they put effort on using genuine bottles.
Checked a seal of a shampoo for my pet, as soon as I removed the cap, seal came off with it. I couldn’t trust this company so I sent them all back to them.

As a consumer, shopping experience with Herbspro was just a nightmare.<//Review>

<review>Fast shipping is a plus! Competitive pricing is another.
However, the website offered a Free Shipping deal that didn't get applied when I went to check out, so I sent an email, and then the Free Shipping deal was removed from the website.
I guess that's responsive customer service?
Emails soliciting a 5-star review also leave me a little cool.</review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Terrible at delivery timing.  Way off by two weeks! Also they substitute brand names.  I ordered one product from a particular company and got similar product by another company instead.  Not what I originally purchased.  They should advise consumer when changing out brand names.</Review>

Perfectly sized small enough to fit in between burners on my stove top.  And, still adequately sized to store any left over grease I have.  Stainless steel is an added positive for easy cleaning in dishwasher or by hand.  I'm totally satisfied that it was a smart purchase.< /text>

<username>Julie Nolle</username><text>On time delivery.  Purchased breakable products, none were damaged. But, as with many vendors, the packaging was excessively protective.   From bubble wrap around the product, to bubble wrap around the bubble wrap to tape making it impossible to open. DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME, I am thrilled to receive undamaged product, but flip when it takes me 20-30 minutes to open the packaging. The product was perfect.</text></record>

I was going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. I decided on 4 because I did get the items I ordered in good condition. However, the shipping time was S L O W! It took 3-4 weeks to get this order. And meanwhile there was no communication from the company. At one point I even emailed them to see if I could get an update and got no answer! No response at all! I thought for sure I had gotten ripped off. Then randomly, weeks later this package appears. Exactly as ordered and with receipt. I don’t know if this is their normal process but it would deter me from purchasing again.</Review>

Placed an order which was summarily cancelled a month later but not refunded. No response despite repeated inquiries. If you place an order use a credit card because you’ll have to file a claim.

EDIT: since leaving my initial review above, i received a direct phone call. Apparently my interaction with them occurred during a technology platform change. I was also assured a refund had been issued though I have yet to receive it. I was asked if I could delete or modify my review. Let’s see: I didn’t receive product or a refund 6 weeks after my order, there’s apparently no trace of my last email but my google review is worth a phone call? Now that’s spunk!

So while these folks clearly have some technology issues I do understand it’s just some people hustling to make a living. I hope everyone else has a better experience. As goes with any merchant, caveat emptor.

And now that I’ve spent more time than the order was worth updating this review, I can’t justify improving the rating beyond what you see here now.< /Review>

I placed an order for Band Aid Tough Strips WATERPROOF band-aids and was very  exacting about that because I had a problem with Amazon on this product.  They sent me WATERBLOCK Tough Strips.  After I finally got through to Customer Service, the person on the phone told me I had received what I had ordered.  I assured him that was not correct because I was very specific because of my problem with Amazon.  He just argued with me with no attempt to make the situation right. Never this company again!< /Text>

I ordered the locking pill container. It’s great. I’ve been trying to find a container I could carry in my purse without worrying about the container popping open. This container accomplishes that perfectly. Order arrived quickly (in fact even sooner than expected).< /Review>

Yes! 5 stars. Order processing/delivery in a timely manner even though I am on the opposite coast.  I haven't used product yet but I am happy with what I received.  Pricing is very reasonable. This is my first time purchasing from HerbsPro and I am sure it won't be the last. Large variety of essenses as well. Used lighter for scale.</text>

Ordering was easy. Variety of products available and some that are difficult to get elsewhere. Product arrived packaged well and in good condition. Taste and quality are good. Only complaint is the length of time to get the products. Ordered on 12/30/20, didn't ship until 1/19/21, and I finally received on 1/26/21. I expected quicker delivery on a product that was in stock.<//review>

I love the nasal inhaler that I’ve been using for about a year. It clears my head and even allows me to settle down at bedtime and fall asleep in a short amount of time. It’s safer than any sleeping item on the market.</review>

I would give Herbspro a -10 if possible.  I ordered  a pain relieving cream ($26.00) and I received a feminine product that came open and spilled during shipment.  1st I emailed them and got no response. Then I called them, and even though I had an order confirmation of what I ordered, their "customer service " rep repeatedly argued with me that I got what I ordered.  So I sent them a copy of the order confirmation with another email.  Their response was "thank you for confirmation of receiving your order".  BUYER BE WARE!!!!!!!!! just throw your money in the trash can because that's what you will be doing if you buy from this place!<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><review>1. Shipping my 6 bottles of gingko biloba took SEVERAL weeks.
2.  I rec'd an emailed customer service satisfaction survey, but I instead wrote to Customer Service letting the company know I couldn't give them a high RATING on the survey, due to slow shipping.  Nobody responded.
3.  One of the capsules in one of the bottles was empty, and it's contents had covered all of the other capsules with powder--so I called Customer Service to request an exchange.
4.  I had a hard time with the rep, who didn't allow me to speak with a supervisor but said, "Our shipping department will send you a return shipping label."  However, I do not have faith I will get a replacement bottle.
5.  If all goes well, I'll edit this review to reflect having had a better overall experience.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1619563063373, 'text': "Hello Allie.

<username>mom5cats kyle</username>< review>
I got everything I ordered; my only complaint - a minor one, really - is that it was shipped by USPS parcel select, which is very slow.  Also, the package did not show up on my USPS Informed Delivery page, which is supposed to notify me whenever mail is delivered.  It was just dumb luck that my caretaker came over the day the package was left in my mailbox (I am disabled and cannot get out to the street where the mailbox is).  Had it sat there a day or longer, in this high crime, drug dealing neighborhood I have to live in, it would have been stolen.<//review>

<review>Great experience with this company!  They fulfilled everything they offered;
my item at best price in comparison to others (I ordered DiaresQ which I had difficulty finding at a reasonable price.  I learned about it from Dr. Oz and it's a great product for a natural heal for food poisonings that cause diarreah ) and quick delivery!  I will order from them again.  Thank you!<//review>< gmap_id>

I finally received the order after one month and after going to the website to inquire why it was late. I had never received even a confirmation email and yet the cost was listed as pending on my CC. later, the pending disappeared altogether confusing me as I wasn't charged. thats when I went to the site to see whats going on and finally it was sent. No, I'm sorry I can't recommend this business. I thank the online worker who finally got my order to me though. She was smart!</Review>

Salicylic bandaids I needed for my daughter were hard to find.  Glad HerbsPro carried them.  Order took 9 business days to arrive, so wish they could have processed a little more quickly,.  Tracking showed the package didn’t arrive at the transport facility until 5 days after order was submitted.  That’s the only reason I took a star off.< /review>

<Review>If you are looking to get your product in a timely manner, I would move onto another company. In today's  online selling and shipping this was a long long wait for the product to even be shipped, when they said it shipped, 10 days later,  it still took 7 days to get from CA to OR. While waiting, I tried to cancel the order, which I believe moved them to ship it, I ordered from another company and received Puritian's order within days and it comes from back east. Prices are also a little higher at HerbsPro than other online vitamin stores. So in the long run, I would recommend you shop around before buying from HerbsPro. The product I purchased was as described.</Review><Rating>2< /Rating></record>

<date>1613061034668</date><rating>2< /rating><Text>I ordered a product and they sent me the wrong brand - a product that sounds similar but is in fact entirely different - and it took several weeks to arrive. When I rechecked their website, they have the wrong image next to the product. I wrote an email to their support team asking how I could remedy this, and two days later got an email thanking me for confirming receipt of my order and asking me to give a positive review. So here I am - I plan on calling them to try to rectify this.< /Text>< Pics>

Hyssop Tea is an excellent deterrent to catching the full influence of the flu if you begin drinking this at the first sign of becoming I'll.  That's how learned about this tea because it worked for me and continues to work. I do not like to be without it in my home .<//text>

My order took a long time and initially for almost two weeks when I logged in it said I had no orders placed which concerned me. Customer service chats did promise the order existed. I received my order several weeks later from the time of ordering and one of my items did leak in the box covering other items. Not sure if I will shop here again because I’m not overly impressed.< /Text>

<text>The pricing is what brought me to your company, plus the products. Your customer service is awesome as well. The only hitch in the process was the delivery process, not a fan of how long it took DHL to move package through their system. In the end the product arrived 4 days earlier than their tracking revealed.< /text>< Name>

<Review>Bad experience.   Paid for items shown as "in stock" on their web site.  Over $50 worth of bar soaps.  They actually had none in stock, and they took a month to send me an email showing a refund.  The credit card still does not show the refund, so a dispute has been opened.  These people are to be avoided.  Ordered 12/12; Dispute opened 12/13;  Notice of cancellation from HP: 12/18/20;  Notice of refund from HP: 1/13/21; Dispute closed by bank in our favor:  2/12/21.  This whole exercise took two months.  No items ever shipped.  No resolution necessary, as order was cancelled and resolved by credit card company.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1613699728922, 'text': 'Dear Customer,\nCan you please provide email us on support@herbpro.com so that we can resolve the issue.

The top of the bottle of mayo, wasn't on securely. I have gotten items from other companies, that packaged glass containers differently, by securing bubble wrap tightly around the jar. It took over a week 2 get here, so this is also part of why I gave 3 stars.<//Review>

<review>It took awhile to get to me but this is the absolute best price for this tea. I love how it makes your skin smooth and hair grow. Take it with vitamin c for optimal benefit. I wish they had automatic monthly delivery.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

< review>
They sent me a fake tracking number 3 weeks AFTER I paid for the item, I wrote them 3 times asking what the proper tracking was, who it was shipped with. I waited 2 weeks for a reply to these 3 emails and nothing. I had to wait for eBay to refund my money and they wouldn't until we went through the full dispute process which was another two weeks, then it took 4 days for the cash to go back into my account. So it was almost 9 weeks total from the time they took my money, to when I was able to get a refund. The seller completely ignored my messages and the ones from eBay customer service. Don't order from here! They have gone downhill! Amazon has even shut them down on their platform for fraudulent activities.< /review>

It took them 2 weeks to deliver. They did not tell you how long or when it would be delivered like Amazon does when you place the order. I also found out that it was an item that I could pick up for $2 less. Doesnt sound like much but the item only cost $5. $2 is worth it ben delivered and not having to get out in the Covid world but the 2 weeks is not acceptable.</text>

<text>I won't buy again. HerbsPro is an outfit that masquerades as an American company. I ordered boxes of tea that my local market ceased carrying. How absurd that the international carrier DHL sent these tiny tea boxes, first to the other side of the country, then domestic mail to a sorting location, then to me. Minimize your carbon footprint! Do without,  is my lesson learned.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My order history is really two orders. The first one took over a month to get to me and then ALL of the glass bottles inside were broken. This would mean 1 star, or zero if possible. The response to that order was then really great. I received the replacement order in 4 days and all glass bottles were in perfect shape. Hopefully, that is the standard by which HerbsPro operates. Time will tell. When the item is needed again, I will probably give them one more chance.<//Review>< gmap_id>

The absolute WORST online shopping experience of my life. They charge your card immediately even though they do not ship for days/weeks. They do not answer the phone and would not respond to emails until I threaten to cancel the order. Stay clear of these people<//text>

<review>While placing an order, which was supposed to be shipped for free, it automatically changed the shipping to priority mail, $37.00 for shipping on a $50 order, without giving me any option to stop the charge process.  How fraudulent is that!  I sent several full cancellation emails and phone messages for a full refund.  We’ll see if that works.  Also filling dispute charge with Visa.  What a rip off!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Always accurate and quick on delivery. Prices are usually the best online. They did have a delay in shipping one item in my order, but they sent updates along the way about restocking and delivery expectancy. Received all my items packaged well too!

I ordered 4 bottles of product and when I received them, the tops had been cracked and each bottle was leaking from the cracks.  It was clearly damaged in shipping, but I also noticed there was little packing in the box.  Suchetta took my call and we discussed  what needed to be done.  She was so helpful and professional.  I appreciate her willingness to help my with this problem.  Her attitude and helpfulness was outstanding.</review>

Reviewing their customer service, not necessarily their products. I placed an order and was sent a confirmation email but there was no way to check on the status of the order without calling the company (as I did not create an account before purchasing). Nor did they answer my two emails asking for an update on shipping. Called 2 weeks after ordering and was informed that my order "should ship in the next 1 to 2 days". 8 days later, no update yet. I will call again and I understand that shipping times are longer than usual, I just would like to be kept in the loop as far as order status and feel that emails/online inquiries should be answered.< /Text>

This is a total scam company, I placed an order 11/17, never heard a thing so I called the first week of December and spoke to a rather unpleasant man  who told me my order would go out tomorrow and then hung up! So rude! Then the next day I received FOUR emails from them stating the order was cancelled and to go to the website and reorder!  I called to find out why and nobody ever answered, so I went with another online company for my order. As of today 12/7 still no refund to my Paypal acct for the order from 11/17, called got the same RUDE man who stated refund would go through tomorrow! SURE it will......Opening a case with Paypal today.< /review>

Herbspro has an awesome range of products: supplements and vitamin that you need. Shipping might take a while depending on where you are, but that is understandable considering the situation nowadays. Their customer service is great as well, very helpful for follow-ups and inquiries. :)< /Text>

Not even worth 1 star !!!

Your service was the worst of any online vendor we have ever dealt with.

You took over 2 weeks to deliver our order.

You shipped an incorrect item

Contacting your customer service by telephone was a horrifying experience, contacting by e-mail was no better.

You did not respond to any of our 4 telephone voice mails or 4 e-mails.

The correct item was finally received yesterday (took roughly a month).

We returned the incorrect item via USPS yesterday.

We will NEVER use your service again.<//text>

<Time>1589945952986<//Time><Rating>4< /Rating><text>HerbsPro has low-unbeatable prices for a vast variety of health products. After placing two orders on their website, I experienced over 10 days delay in shipping, and less than adequate Customer Service first-line responders. However, I got an exceptional support from the Customer Service manager, who turned my overall experience to be a positive one. (I was told the shipment delays were caused by the need to replenish out of stock products from their suppliers.)< /text>< Pics>

Herbs Pro has excellent products that really work. It is a very simple process to get you on the way to feeling like your 21 year old self again when you are really in your 40’s. Let’s get that libido pumping and testosterone level back up where it needs to be and most of all get rid of the stomach. Exercise time without feeling bad afterwards. Thanks Herbs pro I’ll be back next month.< /text>

Hello HerbsPro,

My cardiologist advised me to get a blood pressure monitor and the nurses recommended Omron. I went to the nearby CVS and saw they were rather pricey so the pharmacist recommended I go online. When I saw your price, which is about  one-quarter of the one at CVS, I was skeptical. But I've received the monitor and used it for the first time today and everything seems to be in working order.

I hope it continues to give me good readings, and if I can afford my own personal CAT scan someday, I know where to go!

Best regards,

Jeff Barash<//Text>

I Treasure Herbspro. They have so many items I cannot find in the stores.  Over the Years I have dealt with them, there has been a couple of issues.  Broken cookies, when I reported it, the very gracious representative said to keep the broken chocolate cookies and use them to top ice cream. They shipped me new  ones. Then I received a lovely letter. THANKING me for being a good customer. Professionalism, Kindness, Incredible Stock and the idea of The Customer "Matters"  will keep me using this company.  It Just keeps getting better and better.< /Text>

< review>
Great Customer Support During a Troubling time! My order had taken a bit to be shipped, but I was able to use their handy online chat feature. I had to wait a few minutes to get a live agent, but they promptly figured out the best solution for me. I give them credit for even staying open during such a lousy time but am thankful for them so that I could get my supplements.</review>

Amazing prices.  UPS delivered my order to the wrong address.  Initially HerbsPro was slow in responding to my queries, but eventually a very cordial HerbsPro rep called, evidently willing to do whatever it would have taken to solve the problem.  (In the meantime the person who received my package brought it to me.)  I'll be a repeat customer.</review>

< Review>
Recently, I came across HerbsPro while I was looking to purchase vitamins.  The price was great, so I thought I would give it a try. I definitely will give 5 Stars to HerbsPro and will continue purchasing from HerbsPro.  The entire experience is awesome, the customer services from Sucheta are superb (explain thoroughly, patiently, and honestly).  The products are great and the shipping is fast.  I have already recommending HerbsPro to my siblings.< /Review>

I am glad to mention these next few words in favor of Herbspro. They really care about service and quality. They also package everything really well and their delivery is always on time. Though I had an issue with my last order, upon request, they sent me a return shipping label along with a replacement product.
This is my favorite online health store. Your satisfaction is guaranteed here. They carry items that no other store on the internet does.<//Review>

<review>I have had really good shopping experience with Herbspro. Their website is user friendly, their prices are amazing, they offer free shipping if your order is large enough, and they get your stuff to you very quickly.  I did have one order take longer than usual, but it was during the COVID-19 practical shut down, and all things considered, that went well also. They even emailed me to let me know they were swamped and my order would take longer than usual.  I would recommend them for sure!</review><Rate>5<//Rate><resp>{'time': 1589396524295, 'text': 'Thank you Roger for your valuable feedback....'}< /resp>< pictures>

Having not received my order, I chatted online to ask if it had been shipped a week after the anticipated ship date.  The representative confirmed it would be shipped within a few days and that I would receive tracking info.  Of course, I was concerned since the payment was processed on the day I ordered, although delayed shipments can be expected right now due to the high demand with COVID-19.</review>

I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS AGAIN WITH THIS COMPANY -
44 DAYS AGO THIS COMPANY CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD $120 FOR ALCOHOL DISINFECTANT AND NEVER SEND THE ITEM I PURCHASED NOR ANY OTHER COMMUNICATION/STATUS (EMAIL)... NOTHING .

THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE. I LOST MY MONEY!

IS THIS A REAL COMPANY....... OR A SCAMMER?????<//text>

Ordered something 12/13/19 and was told at time of order it would ship within 3-5 days.  I was charged for this order on 12/13/19.  1/8/2020 The order had still not shipped.  Called customer service held three times for 15+ minutes and each time got hung up on as they answered.  Called back and pressed one for placing an order instead of number 2 for customer service and low and behold they answered immediately.  I was told the order would ship in a few days.  When asked why it was charged for but not shipped....crickets.  I asked to cancel my order and he said canceled, anything else Mam?  I asked for a confirmation number and was quickly given one.  Hoping I will get my money refunded but I have my doubts.  DO NOT ORDER from this COMPANY!!!!<//review>

Excellent product and great pricing, I am really happy with purchase because the mother does not collect in the bottom of the jar like other famous brands. You know you are getting all the benefits in each amount you use.< /Text>

Great company to buy my monthly stock of supplements. Everytime I order - seamless transaction, the products arrived in just a few days. Packed beautifully, and everything in the box was as it should be. I have found some items on their website that no one else carries. Herbspro is good!< /Review>

I do feel like this company does do whatever they can to have a satisfied customer. I appreciate the communication I received until my order was picked up.   This covid19 did cause a lot of trouble and delays, but they were very responsive and corrected an issue I had with a delivery to a wrong address. Thank you Herbpro for all you did.<//text>

I ordered from Herbspro on 02/28. Expected ship date: 03/03. I still haven't received what I ordered.

I reached out to customer service via phone & email without a response on 6 occasions, including their sales support. No answer, just a voicemail.

I do not recommend this business. I have contacted my credit card company to report fraud on purchased goods not received.<//review>

<Review>Edit: After leaving this review and a voicemail with the company I was promptly contacted by the head of customer service who graciously  addressed my issue and concerns. She updated me on the status of my order and moved to ship the available items from my order today while we wait for the other items to be fulfilled by the manufacturer. This is the kind of customer service I really appreciate!

Poor customer service team and communication. I understand shipping times are slow during these times, but have not received any communication about items I ordered being on backorder, nor has there been an attempt to ship items that are currently available in waiting. Online chat representative was completely unprofessional, unresponsive, and did not handle this issue with care. Trying to contact them to cancel my order and still unsuccessful. Would not attempt to order from them again—back to iHerb and Vitacost.</Review><user>101277503508082747145</user><gmap_id>0x808f95775d36653b:0xa30a9f369c26d16c<//gmap_id>< name>

I tried to place an order with Sucheta and she was very helpful.
However, Herbspro website and especially the order page was not functioning very well, and I could not place my order. My order placed was taking way too long to confirm. I would encourage the owners of this company to contact their IT Dept to fix this important problem. I almost cancelled my order, but Sucheta went out of her way to place my order for me - she was wonderful and extremely professional. I would recommend anyone who wants to place an order to ask for Sucheta! I look froward to receiving my order i hope in a timely manner.</review>

<review>My shipment was taking a longer time due to the COVID 19 issues. I contacted HerbsPro by email listed on the initial email I received confirming my order. Within a day I received an email from Sucheta who informed me the product would ship the next day. Sucheta was correct.  Sucheta maintained contact with me through email to keep me informed as to the progress of my order. I was very appreciative of the communication I received and the product arrived as promised.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

It’s been over two weeks and I have not received my order.  There’s been zero communication from the company since they took my payment.  I should have read the company reviews before ordering.  I’m going to assume I’ll never receive my order and move on with my life.  Typically, I do not write reviews but I’m hoping to save an unsuspecting potential customer from losing their hard earned money.< /review>

<username>Zee Rodriguez</username><review>It took a whole month to receive my item, I wasn't even sure that I would ever get it. I sent an email after waiting 2 weeks for my purchase
to find out what was happening with my order and I never got a reply back. When I first placed my order I received an email stating that my order was processing. I then recieved an email the next day asking for a review, how can I review a company on anything if I just purchased from them a day before! I never got an email stating my item was ever shipped. I couldn't check my order on their site because they don't have any way for you to check your status. I wish I would have read all the negative reviews before purchasing from HerbsPro.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Awful - Took 16 days to get my product and then when I did get it today, the plastic container was shattered into little broken pieces and the grooming wipes  for my dog are all dried out.  The package should have had bubble wrap around it.  Also, should not take 16 days to deliver.  Contacted them and told them I want a replacement or my $$ back.  He said he will send replacement.  We'll see if I ever get it.

UPDATE: Happy to report this vendor did in fact replace product free of charge.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I ordered about 3 months ago and still have not received the items (though they were charged immediately). They create a shipping label but never actually ship the items.
It took dozens of emails and phone calls for them to agree to refund my money.< /Review>

They reached out after 10 days of the shipping date to say they did not shipped yet and dont have an ETA. Look some other shop, I had a big problem at home because of their lack of responsibility and communication.<//Review>

HerbsPro accidentally shipped only two of five items to us.  Fortunately, they corrected the situation promptly and the missing items are on there way to us.< /review>

< Review>
It take times to get a phone call from them. I have been waiting for my order for more than ten days and they didn't even update my order status!!! Luckily, they reached me shortly and solved my problem. Now I am waiting for my order coming. Hopefully, It will arrive on time.</Review>

I ordered a product on August 20.  They shipped it Aug. 23, 2016.  They said it would be delivered to me between August 26-31.  I never got it, so I emailed them.  They told me to wait another five days!!  It's been over five days, and I still have not received my order.  I cannot track it, and they refuse to do it for me or even give me an accurate tracking number.  Today is September 5, 2016, two weeks since they shipped it.  I now have to wait until tomorrow, since today is Labor Day and no mail.  Never again will I order from this company.</Text>

Not impressed.  Poor customer service.  I sent an e-mail to ask where my order was - no reply.  My order finally arrived 16 days after my credit card was charged - and it's missing an item.  There are other companies out there with much better service.</text>

<review>The delivery took longer than expected so I contacted the company.  Sucheta from customer's service reached out to me to explain why and follow up with the carrier and since it showed that it was delivered, she called me to ask if I received and if it was ok.  I think that it is a good customer's service practice and thank her for reaching out to me.< /review></record>

I have dealt with this company 3 times and received my order within a week with no problems.  It was for the Ridgecrest ClearLungs products which have worked great for smoking family members, giving them huge relief, products are natural.<//Review>

They deserve  (-)....but there is no such an option, so I put for them the lowest possible. This is, without any doubt, the worst company I run across last 20+years. They never answer phone calls, shipping from CA to AZ is one day with FedEx or USPS. They used DHL....and couldn't deliver for 10 (ten) days. When I called to order...there was an indian (from india) with broken English, hard to understand....I should got away at that point....I learned that lesson the hard way.<//review>

They call and harass you about the feedback you leave.  HORRIBLE COMPANY.  Order never arrived and they don't care!  No refund offered. Stay FAR FAR away from this company,< /text>
