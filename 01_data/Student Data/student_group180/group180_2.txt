So glad I found this place on my way out of California on a road trip!  They have EVERYTHING and fire strains.  Loved the LA KUSH (all strains) and the Jerry Garcia Grape Stomper strain.  Lit!  And the owner is so good at what she does and customer service goes a long way and she knows that,  and she has this place dialed in and they are awesome.  We even said to ourselves it would be worth the drive from LA some days when we’re bored and want to take a drive, this place is that good.  Thanks everyone for the experience and will define be back!< /Review>

<review>Stopped here twice ever, on my way in and out of Cali months apart. It’s obvious this place is taking advantage of customers mid-travels and selling overly expensive stuff w minimal product knowledge. When talking about cartridges I was asked if I wanted “hybrid or indica” but told no info on cannabinoids % or strains till I asked to look at the packages. For $50+ half gram cartridges mind you, with no price range of  other/cheaper options available. Compare that to $30 half g and $45 full g cartridges from solid 80+ percent thc brands like Moxie in other better stocked dispos. Slim pickings in Needles y’all</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Really happy I visited. Even though they Initially didn't have what I ordered, I figured you can't always get what you want. Friendly staff and seem to enjoy their job. Wide selection and good prices and discounts on Friday. Gotta fix those debit card readers tho.......Close to no one wears a mask!</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I loved stopping into this dispensary!! I'm from the PNW where weed is half the price of the areas I've been staying in my travels so I was thrilled to hear that they sell gram cartridges as low as ~$40, rather than a half gram for the same price which sadly seems to be typical the further south I go. I also brought my boyfriend with me who isn't as avid of a smoker as I am; Cynthia knew what she was talking about and was  an absolute delight to talk to as we decided on what product to buy. The vibe of the shop was really relaxed and comfortable and I'm excited to say I'll likely get the chance to stop in again this weekend!<//Review><gmapID>0x80ce234df950c90d:0xf3d7edc98c0792c2</gmapID>< Time>

Do NOT shop here. I am a medical patient who received nothing but a joint filled with sticks and lots of stems that wants to stick OUT OF THE PAPER. I paid $18 for one small joint of SHAKE & STEMS ...no flower. The lady who cashed us out was making me feel anxious, being impatient with me. She basically crumbled my bag, stapled it and sent me and my boyfriend on our way.

I came looking for concentrate and flower.  It was my first time here and I wouldn’t recommend my fellow medical friends to buy from here. Save your money.</text>

<Review>Stay away from this place.  Have given them multiple chances. This is the last time I will ever come here.  You have been warned. BAIT AND SWITCH. Not the first time. Was told to come back tomorrow for their "special" $50 1/2 oz on sour diesel. I drove 1hour (50 miles) and now I'm told it was double the price.  When I came in initially I was intending on buying an ounce the bud tender said no come back tomorrow for the other half. I did as he said now I'm told its double the price and I'm out 1/2 the product. This place is a scam.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I came in there September 20, 2019 and was very happy with the amount of product on the shelves...Was also very happy with what I ended up getting but on the other hand the first dube tube I opened up had nothing in it, I would’ve totally came back but was already to my hotel for the night in L.A. and was leaving the next morning to catch my flight back home to Tennessee & then drove the rest of the way home to Michigan, just like I said I  was very happy with everything but when I grab my first one it was empty...But other then that I would’ve totally gave you a 5 start rating!!!!!<//review>

The selection was alright, but the prices were pretty steep for the flower they had. I had a coupon, which brought out three different employees to look over. Asked me where I got it, like I made it or something. Kinda a weird experience all around. Most likely won't be back.

It’s says it closes at 10 pm it’s 9:12pm and it’s closed. I hate when companies advertise the wrong hours or close early at their convenience. This is unprofessional. Lost a great customer due to the lack of professionalism.</review>

Was a customer before Herbarium took over. Unfortunately the new owners don't understand loyal customer. Everything has changed and not for the better. I have quit coming there because of the treatment received. My business is now with THC. Sad sad sad. Employees even say how many customers have quit going to you guys.</Text>

Buyers beware! I drove several hours to this facility only to return home after and find brown dirt weed mixed in with what I thought I was buying in two separate pouches .  The smell of the brown rag weed that I was not aware even existed anymore contaminated and mixed the smell with the small amount of the intended purchase.. I have yet to receive a call back from the manager concerning my dismay and complaint . Considering you can not see through the containers it is impossible to spot or smell till they are opened and by then it is too late. No way to prevent it so shop at your own risk.</Review>

They knew what they were talking about, we asked if they had a certain brand, they didn't but they are always willing to bring something new in. Anyway. Found all that I purchased was great. The service was fantastic,  Laci was very informative and quick with the register. You "ROCK" Laci. If ever in town again. Will difently stop in again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Impressive ability to underperform already low expectations.

I’ve never had something so simple become so complex, every single time. Home of the thousand yard stare and “I don’t know”. Don’t come here for solutions. Unless you absolutely must use UPS (in which case, pick a different store) I’d recommend the FedEx down the street, they’re great.<//Text>

<Review>Staff is not very knowledgeable about UPS services. They will flat out tell you they don’t offer a service even if it says it on the UPS website. They also will refuse service to certain customers so beware. Definitely not returning here.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Nowhere on the website does it specify hours for Notary, but when I arrived  at 6:20 they said Notary ends at 6. How is it acceptable to waste customer's time with something like this? Post the hours that Notary is available!<//Review><name>Wendy McConnell< /name>< Pics>

Not sure if I've ever experienced such a volatile and inefficient customer service oriented business before stepping into this store. They have lost several packages and won't take the blame or help you tracking them down. All the while Rik, the franchisee/"owner" gets in your face and tells you to leave as soon as he (inevitably) starts to lose the argument. STAY AWAY. STAY FAR AWAY!< /text>

We are regulars to this UPS store for over a year now. The owner and the staff here have only been helpful and super friendly! They all treat me kindly 🧡 The drivers who come through this store are great as well :)

I've tried using 2 other stores closer to home however found myself gravitating back to this store... the energy is more welcoming!</review>

Since we moved to downtown San Jose a few months ago I've used this UPS store location as our package mailing address to avoid having anything stolen from our home. I'm at the store 3 times a week and feel welcomed every time. The employees are kind and helpful and the parking plentiful. I highly recommend this location.</Text>

Unfortunately the employees here are misinformed about the services they offer. I hate to leave such a negative review because they were friendly and very nice but that doesn’t make up for the fact that the boxes shipped for my wedding did not arrive in time. My husband went to ship three boxes to Maui. He explained to the employee, Jennifer, that they absolutely needed to arrive in time because they contained items for our wedding. Jennifer told him not to worry, the service she advised him to select would allow them to arrive in PLENTY of time – even a whole week early. However, this is not what happened. Little did we know, the boxes were transferred to USPS (which we were NOT informed of) and with USPS “there are no guarantees,” or so they keep telling us.  Why would Jennifer suggest this service if she knew the boxes were for a WEDDING? I would expect the employees to offer services based on customer needs and our need was not met – not even close.

I have been told to take this up with the manager, Serjio, who conveniently is not working every time I call for an update. I have been dealing with this now for three full weeks. In terms of customer service, this is unacceptable. We paid $180 to have these boxes shipped and since they did not arrive on time (when we were told they would) I expect to be reimbursed for the shipping cost. In addition, I now have three large boxes full of wedding items sitting in Maui that I could not use for my wedding due to a UPS employee error.

To say I am disappointed, not only by the employee error but also by their lack of attempt at resolving this, would be an understatement. Thanks, UPS, for putting a black mark on my wedding day.<//review>

{'time': 1476458970237, 'text': 'Their choice was the lower cost of service, which was USPS. We always tell all our customers that USPS is not a guarantee service. If you been in any USPS office , then you should know they do everything on their time and pace. We explained this to the customer, but they still picked USPS. Now they want a refund for a USPS service that we do not have any control. I contacted the local USPS about the delay and they stated that I have to contact the Hawaiian USPS for a refund. The package left our location and was processed at the main post office. The Hawaiian USPS office did their thing and that is why it did not make it on time. If they chose UPS, then we have control on the time frame and a refund can be possible.'}<//Response>

While other stores make you pay for tape or helping them pack for you (Amazon returns), this store goes above and beyond and does so much for you! They are super understanding if you run out of tape or ask for their help. They even will make sure to place the return authorization code inside the box along with putting the label on the outside of the box for you! Been going here after trying so many UPS stores around here.< /Review>

I've been in an out of this UPS store many times and most of the time they go above and beyond.  They can get busy at times however with a little patience they'll accommodate and take care of notary, shipping, packaging, print jobs, faxing, mail forward, PO boxes and so much more.</review>

I had a project that needed to be printed and the team at The Alameda UPS Store came through.  The team at UPS was very communicative and rushed the order so that the project was on time despite my company's portion being late.  If I need another job in the San Jose area I will use them again and I highly recommend them for yours.</Review>

<Review>Insulted by the owner when I asked how do I prove my package was lost, his response, if you don't trust us go somewhere else (where did that come from???).  What a werido, this person should not own a business.  He was soo bad, I took my 400 worth of packages to the Post Office and saved $100 on shipping, so thank you!  PS: awesome employees, they are the only reason for any of these good reviews!  UPS should pull the tapes and review this interaction, it was horrible!  Thanks in advance for responding to this post trying to explain away today, because nothing is your fault;)</Review>< user_id>

I'm a Detroit native and can say that their Detroit style pizza is the real deal. I took a friend who had never tried it and it's his new favorite. Excellent service from the staff. Parma definitely deserves 5 stars< /Review>

Came because they had Sicilian/Detroit-style pizza. We got one Sicilian (pictured) and one NY style pizza. The thick, slightly fried up Sicilian crust was exactly what I was looking for. The NY style was a little too fluffy/springy and maybe a touch too salty with all the cheese. The texture seemed better suited to be a Neapolitana style (which they also have, but we didn't officially try so will have to go back). Order takers were friendly. Will definitely be back!<//text>

< Review>
I only go there for the individual slices - which are almost 100% like the slices you can get in a NYC pizzeria any time of the day. I drive 35 miles to get there & it's just right every time! I joked to the counter man that I'm fine with driving 35 miles because it's a lot easier than the 3000 miles to go to NYC. I'm a native New Yorker, out here for 30 years & my need to "get home" for real pizza has been solved! I go to Thousand Oaks & the taste brings me both back home & back in time. I LOVE Parma slices. The rest of the menu looks pretty good, too. 🍕</Review>

For California this is a phenomenal pizza. All of the other food is pretty excellent too. I'm from NJ and this is pretty much the only edible pizza within 40 mins from port hueneme. Inside is super cool with signed guitars all along the walls, very clean and well kept place. Will definitely go back!</text>

I am a big fan of Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza and Parma Detroit Pizza was recommended to me.  Excellent! Possibly my favorite ever. Now I don't have to go into Los Angeles for great pizza.

The Detroiter, yeah!</Review>

The best pizza anywhere in the entire T.O. - Westlake - Agoura area.  Fantastic pizza.  Love both the NY style and Detroiter.  If you ate at Domino’s or some other chain place instead of here, Shame on you!!   Our family fave.< /text>

<review>This is the one pizza place which my entire family can agree on. Kids and I love the giant NY pizza with the huge slices. My wife loves their gluten free Detroit pizza. Which is very light and fluffy. Friendly, fast service and fun atmosphere.</review></record>

Wholly guac. Just grubbed a man sized pizza and I want more. If your looking to switch up the pizza game, this place has thick crusty Detroit style za. They combo the toppings like true artists and the baked cheese on the edges  rocked my world. Plus the meatballs on top just made me cheese my pants. See you soon Parma<//review>

<Review>There aren’t a lot of Pizza places near by that offer a deep dish option. Parma Pizzeria is one of them and in my opinion they are consistently the best. They’ve dedicated themselves to making the best pizza and their passion shows. I always get their pizza for take out so I have yet to have it straight out of the oven, I may be missing out on the freshness of a piping hot pie. But I’m not complaining< /Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Pizza was amazing! Ohio, New York, and Detriot styles.  I gave it a 4 star because service can be slow and the place is relatively small so large groups beware. Between 20$ and 30$ a pizza; reasonable for top quality pizza with amazing sauce.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO20gOnHDv1iZQmbA9jHEAa318Qsy4mlNrlQxxu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQQIr1qLEiGhQnYRuFqc3e-zxl4sKIcH6V4Aau=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHSeY7VyXLTFc7TniQfFmC9bJ5_rs2nYkKPkTo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoH_nBcpynJnf-JHolr5trUAy6I8naQobPw9In=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80e83ab5b3db124b:0x6d7a56434737b19a< /gmap_id></record>

had a lot of pizza in my lifetime including living in NYC nine years and making trips four times a year to chicago over five years.  parma’s bissonette deep dish pizza ranks up with the best of them.  this is a great pizza with tons of flavor and the right balance of ingredients.

owner is pat benatar bassist mick mahan and he knows pizza.  service is fast and friendly and they have some cool swag and memorabilia on the walls to boot.

if you are in thousand oaks and crave pizza, stop here.< /Text>

Pizza is good but the customer service sucks. Ordered a "NY Margaret pizza large" said it just like that, but was given some tiny little pizza instead. When I told the staff I ordered a large they just said "sorry must have misunderstood you" didn't even offer to remake the size I had originally ordered! Now I will always triple check the size I order from now on, still can't get over how rude the staff was.</Review>

We ordered the Detroit style pizza and it did not disappoint! I grew up in Detroit and have missed this staple so much! Really glad to have found Parma in our backyard!< /review>

One pizzeria with regional pizza selection.  I ordered the Hawaiian Ohio and the Detroit pizza, ( can't recall the name but had mega amount of toppings). Both were hella filling and made great leftovers. The pizza actually does great couple days old in the fridge. They have lunch specials hopefully I can make it in time for.

Totally will come back.<//review>

fantastic service and delicious pizza! the detroit pizza we had was nice and thick and full of delicious toppings made ultra fresh to order. the pizza chef even came by our table and asked if we had any questions about the place and the pizza, super friendly. they also have new york and italian style pizzas available that i will definitely be back to try out! if you are curious which pizza is in my photo, it is the detroit veggie pizza with sausage added. incredible!</Review>

Pretty decent pizza, being from NY it is tough to really like the west coast version of it.  We will probably go again.  They really should change the rating system, I'd give it a 7 of 10 stars.<//Text>

You guys are a Pizza Place of your own.

Im from Chicago and damn...your pizza is better in a different way. Chicago, sure, Pizza Pie Deep Dish.

But the flavors, the ingredients you all use...damn. I might get shot from other Chicagoans for saying this (but you might be better.)

Maybe not better than Fox's Pizza, but damn better than any other Western Pizza I will ever have.

I wish I can give you more stars. I really do.

Keep it up Parma!!!

Sincerely,

A Seriously Satisfied Customer for life!</Review>

<review>They have 4 different styles of pizza dough from thin crust to deep dish.   Our group tried 3 of the  4 kinds. We all thought the pizza was great.   The service was also excellent with answers to all our questions.   The pizzas toppings were very fresh with quality ingredients.  We will definitely be going back again.</review><resp>None</resp></record>

<Review>Ordered through their third party app called Menufy because their app no longer loads, which seemed easy, until I got home. Thought I ordered a full cheese with half pepperoni. What did I get? Full pepperoni with half cheese. Not good when one of the people the pizza is for doesn't eat meat.  It's a shame their app doesn't work anymore, not only did the third party app charge an extra fee, it was confusing.  That'll teach me to not check my order before I leave the restaurant. $40 for some breadsticks and a messed up pizza ‍< /Review><gmap_id>0x80e83ab5b3db124b:0x6d7a56434737b19a<//gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1593665739310, 'text': "Hello Brett.

Just finished off a Naples style margherita pizza and half of a Detroit style veggie (I'm vegetarian). Ever since my honeymoon where I had the best pizza of my life in Naples, Italy I've been on the search. Tarantula Hill Brewing Company does a really good pizza, but so does this place and Parma has a lot more options. Neither are as good as Pizzeria Napoli In Bocca, which is why i can't give it 5 stars, but this place is quite tasty. I'll be back.</review>

Excellent fresh ingredients and great friendly team. Whether you like a single slice, whole pie or a variety of crust options, this is the place for you. Great beer 🍺 selection too.  Coke product served as well.  Excellent  price for quality pizza 🍕. Remember, this is not a box pizza chain and this is what makes their fresh ingredients so great. Plenty of free parking in the back and in front. You can dine in or take out.  They also have a wood burning oven for extra flavor. We had a vegetarian New York style pie...delicious 😋. We will definitely be back to try the other crusts too.</review>

<Text>Really like eating at Parma pizza.

Food is excellent. The Detroiter is a must have. Thick pan style pizza with a slathering of sauce across the top. It is excellent.

I have eaten at the Parma truck as well and it does not compare to eating at the restaurant.<//Text><userid>103118150455785014566<//userid>< name>

If you want real pizza from Naples come here hands down. You get the thin crust and quality ingredients. This is not thick crust American style bready pizza. It’s thin and best eaten with a fork and knife. Can’t get enough!< /text>

<review>This place has great pizza!! Its not too greasy which is awesome because usually I feel weighed down by pizza but I dont get that feeling with their pizza. The dough has that freshly made quality that I like in pizza. The sauce is enough to be present but not enough to overpower the pizza.

The different styles are an added bonus. This is definitely my new place to get pizza.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e83ab5b3db124b:0x6d7a56434737b19a<//Gmap_id><user>117841795259447032524<//user>< Pics>

First off, yes, it is a bit pricey, but that cannot deter me from giving this place 5 starts.  If you haven't had Detroit style pizza, you must come here and have it.  Most people don't realize there is such a thing.  I am from Detroit and we have a few places that are legendary...Buddy's Pizza, Shield's Pizza, and Jets.  Parma Pizzeria does a great job bringing my home-town comfort food to Thousand Oaks.  They have a very friendly staff and the owner cares deeply about the pizza craft.</Text>

One of the best, if not the best, pizzas in Ventura county! We tried the Detroiter, garlic bread, and a slice of NY style pizza. All three were awesome! What makes their pizza great, in my opinion, is their dough. The Detroiter is a thicker pizza with a cheesy edge that gives the crust a great crunch. I tried a small piece of my daughters NY style slice, and it's the best NY style pizza I've tried in southern California. If you're around the Thousand Oaks area, you should give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed! Definitely coming back!< /Review>

Pizza is good. But it took 50 min to get a pizza. I called it in ahead lady said 20 min. I got there at 25 min. And waited an additional 25 min inside to get my pizza. They had 3 people working on a fund raiser night. If she had told me it was going to take an hour I wouuldve not ordered from there.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Ordered for the first (and last) time through Door Dash. Pizza showed up in a timely fashion though it was COLD and did not include the toppings we ordered. Thinking it may have been a mix up by the driver I called the store within a few minutes after the pizza was delivered. I never received a return call. For a $38.00 pizza you would hope customer service were a bit more on the ball.</review>< pics>

<text>When you think of Pizza, you most likely have your go-to place located a mile or 2 from your home. Well it's time to break away from the norm, and experience a taste of The Best pizzas from around the world through a gateway located in Thousand Oaks CA.

Want an authentic New York pizza? Goto Parma.
How about an original one from Detroit or Ohio? Goto Parma! How about tasting an authentic pizza from Naples or Sicily? Yes, Goto Parma!!!  They even have a very special Red Oven especially for the Neapolitan Pizza. Highly recommended!!

I asked what makes them so different. They said they make all their pizza dough & sauce FROM SCRATCH daily. I especially love the extra cheese which stretches out long from the pan to your plate as you serve yourself. The crust tastes very good too.

TIP: Save $5 on your 1st online order by Texting PARMA to 33733. Their app is very easy to use.<//text>< Pictures>

Be careful if your instincts are not up to par I wouldn't recommend this place. However on the other side of the nickle service is fast they do a good job their service rates are almost what the competitions are sometimes it veries. I personally frown coming to this place unless I got a blow out near there. It's kind of grimmy  it can be accident prone from all the pnematic air tools & long hoses, tools, tires ,rims, floor-Jack's, etc laying around. So if you must go just be extra cautious, be sober 💯% watch your step.< /text>

Very fast (& friendly) service. I was driving on my spare and that's all I needed to tell them when I drove on to their lot. They had me back safely on the road with a spare where it belongs(in the trunk).😁< /Text>

Straight forward no fuss tire shop.  My family and I have been coming here for years.  Used tires for my compact car are only  $35 and I have to have an issue.  Today I came in because the low tire pressure light kept coming on eventhough I checked all 4 tires twice.  They found which was leaking air but solved the problem without trying to sell me something I didn't need.<//Review>

<Time>1536711281693<//Time><text>I had a blowout and put on my donut type spare on my car and threw the flat tire/wheel in my trunk. Later that morning I got a used tire from a friend. I went to this establishment with the used tire to get the used tire installed onto the rim then have them mount the wheel onto my car. They removed my spare donut tire and placed it into my trunk. Then they removed my blown tire carcass and put it into my trunk on top off the spare. Then they grabbed the tire I got from my buddy and installed the used tire onto my rim and lastly they balanced the wheel, THEY DID IT ALL FOR ONLY $!0!! And it took only 10 minutes.

(Translated by Google) I went to have a tire repaired and they helped me with rapids and excellent work. It is my preference when I occupy tire service. I recommend them to all those who are looking for good quality tires and at a reasonable price. When you occupy service you see Gaby's Tires.

<Text>FAMILY OWNED AND PROUD TO BE!! Great restaurant to the community and to people traveling afar. Their staff if very helpful, friendly and makes you feel at home. I had the unknowing pleasure (at initial conversation) of speaking to the original owners daughter. She is efficient and fast without making you feel rushed.  The food is great, its both comfort food and they have a wide variety of options (but not too much). Their vegi burger is delightful and today I had pancakes and eggs which was just right!
I highly recommend this place , so come check it out!
Oh  .....they're very mindful of keeping everything clean as well! 👍🏼💜< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCWGZoFGEFgLkd8J2E3LzvKsmySDxOhZUh1atY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAM3qcZGSf31O0JrE8-V9eAVKzhFzuht3jFcp9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONHxEQfhiHiBBn-lN8uEjcYAVfoFDL34w25TTS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLT_IQHKc4yFQwB8FkJ6YDyp15cz55HsBTi0OA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4_BXseGW8q6L8SnxYPTJuYddxRs5Q7VpSnUZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP_nXH4igCaCvHrWxf7b9KBXGjVTudeZUilVRd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVHOhGFhqYu2RF2cmOtmF61__G6C8kuwJPrIUc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk248iXPasA1LZccr2xz3Ux75ptSV5MjdZd8W1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPCMvYfxAz5fimlypuGA3ibNv38zY7l9wthHK2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkNfSEaVt8sM3lVBlSjJiTd0ikAR1T0JFgb4a8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVCMXR0ZdxmsQzVWErSOWx_d0t4UKi_UbnCHEj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Darth Vato<//Name><review>Gotta say this is a hidden gem. The cheesesteak was good. Their fries are awesome if you ask for them well done. Drive through is a bit tricky, and please be courteous and wear your mask, the air travels into the window from outside. Your servers are no good to you if they're sick. Be excellent to each other.</review>< Rate>

<Review>This place is always packed at lunchtime and has a large menu. The food is good but, a bit on the pricey side. A large chocolate shake was $7.50!! I will go back though. Minus the shake. lol</Review>< pics>

I came here for lunch on a rainy day near my work place. I ordered a Charbroiled Chicken Breast Sandwich and Fries no drink food was ok, I did feel that it was expensive these two items came out to $12.00+tax. If food was better I would have not mind that price, food was not ALL that!<//review>

Been coming here for almost 20 plus years. Classic diner food. Breakfast, lunch or dinner is great here. The pastrami fries are good, but the burgers and breakfast is even better!<//Text>

<Date>1581455758478</Date><review>Just returned from lunch and here's what happened... I work about 5 minutes away and from experience I called AHEAD of time to place my order due to how busy it gets during lunch hour. While placing my order,  I mentioned that I would be eating there but am phoning in and ordering ahead of time.  I arrived to find my order in a bag.  I explained to the person I was paying that the order was for dining in and that I would be seated.  After a few minutes, a lady came (without my food) and told me that my salad was ready and in a bag on the counter.  I once again told her that I was dining in.  My expectation was to have my salad replated and served, however I was delivered my salad in the same to go bag that it was in when I walked in!   Granted, this isn't a five star or even a 2 star restaurant, however I paid 11 bucks for this salad only to have it delivered in a bag!  Advice for the order taker, the cashier and the server... LISTEN FOR COMPREHENSION, SLOW DOWN AND JUST LISTEN.   Not too sure I will be visiting again.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Well ran establishment. I'm there for the burger special so cant speak for other plates on the menu. However, the prices have gone up so have chose to go to other venues for lunch. It is now almost $10 for a cheeseburger special. Some will say it a good price, and I wont argue that. Just not for me.</text>

< Review>
First time eating here. I ordered a breakfast burrito with one meat, which had potatoes,  eggs, cilantro (I think ) and a small container of salsa. Very big, at least for me but tasty.  If you prefer water, they have plastic glasses to the right of the soda fountain and water dispensed from containers that are labeled 'water'.</Review>

Beautifully delicious food! Had the Gyro sandwich and my wife had the philly cheese steak sandwich. Bomb wow. They taste and look like home cooked meals. Plates average 10 dollars but good and decent size meals. Try it out</Text>

The food is amazing! I've never been let down. The chicken burrito to die for. And their salsa always reminds me home, very authentic! Love it! Drive thru is a tiny bit slow but totally worth the wait just not on lunch break haha. That's my only pet peeve. Other than the tiny tiny flaw, food is amazing!<//text>

They have yummy burgers here! I've tried the chili burger & the avocado bacon burger. I enjoy the fries as well, they're crispy on the outside and soft inside. The service is fast and friendly. I recommend them!</Review>

<Review>It's not a bad place to get some good breakfast. Ordered the BLT then the other person I hamburger with French fries. Nice people work there, overall I cannot give it 5 stars because it wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it's definitely not a bad place to go eat in the morning. They also have a drive-thru and plenty of seating.</Review><Name>Orange County Local< /Name></record>

Takes forever to get your order. And not that good when you do get it. I think they should offer a free drink when they keep you waiting so long, but they don't have great customer service either.<//Text>

This place was the dirtiest place I have ever been to in my life I've worked in the food and beverage restaurant industry for 10+ years I've been a fast ordered short order cook for five years I know it's not hard to keep everything clean this place is disgustingly dirty no proper food handling procedures at all implemented going straight from picking up dirty dishes and bussing tables to touching Raw bacon and eggs with bare hands not washing once to touching tortillas for burritos and putting the tortillas on top of dirty dish rags that were used to wipe down the counter and the cooks hands as well I was appalled at the cleanliness of this place I got a refund and told them reason if someone know the number to the health department please give it to me< /Review>

Fabulous ranchero sauce, my one sister has the huevos rancheros, I have an avocado omelette  with a side of  rancheros sauce and my other sister loves their cheese burgers  for breakfast, when our cousin goes she loves their pancakes. The ladies are wonderful, our coffee cups are never empty.

I tried their burgers and I tried their mexican food.  I thought it was all really greasy and subpar.  Place should change their name to Christo's Mediocre Effort.< /Text>

<review>THE PLACE IS AVERAGE NOTHING SPEECIAL ABOUT IT.  I HAD THE 0HILLY CHEESE -- BIG MISTAKE.  THE ONLY FLAVOR I TASTED WAS THE BREAD.   THE WAS MEAT TASTED GUMMY IF NOT RUBBERY.   THEY PROBABLY MAKE A KILLING WHEN THEY PURCHASE THEIR MEAT BECAUSE I COULDNT TASTE NO MEATY FLAVOR WHAT SO EVER.  I ONLY NEED TO EAT 9NCE AT A PLACE TO KNOW NOT TO EVER GO BACK.  POR EXPERIENCE FOR ME -- MAYBE YOUR LUCK IS DIFFERENT, BUT I AM NOT WILLING TO PUSH MY LUCK HERE.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

After repeating myself 3 times that did not want the veggies on my chili burger, it still came with all the trimmings complete with thousand island and tomatoes.Maybe it's me but every one else in the western hemisphere makes a chili burger with meat, chili cheese and options of mustard and onion.Please listen to your customers when they order.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The truth is very bad experience ... the dish cost $ 10.00 for the very miserable price served. Stingily he did not explain to me why so few people in the place ... and very bad service ... We need something ... before they were generous and cheaper dishes, now they are expensive and stingy ... I do not recommend it ... very poor customer service ... and people are not friendly. with an angry face ... we are paying them not Give free food zero recommend to friends or family ... lousy place ...

I have been going to the Laser Image Company for several years. I absolutely love how efficiently and expertly they use the small space. They are always professional and thorough. The results have always worked well for me. Each team member is well-trained, kind, and thoughtful. I am looking forward to a new procedure there that I haven’t yet scheduled because of my own work schedule. Will do soon! Thank you for making my experience enjoyable and comfortable.< /text>

<Review>I've been coming here for a handful of years to handle various skin issues. The staff is friendly and most importantly highly skilled. This is clearly the result of outstanding training. I've had the pleasure of meeting the manager, John, who is very professional and personable. He really makes you feel welcome...giving you a confident feeling that you'll get the best treatment possible which has always been the outcome!</Review>< pics>

I have technically only had a consultation at the Laser Image Company. The consultation is in fact free and everyone is very professional and sweet. Adriana was great, instead of just selling products or services she asked questions to see what procedures would actually work for me.

I am scheduled to have my Fibroblast Therapy to both my hooded eyes and deep lines in my forehead, tomorrow. I couldn’t have the procedure done the day of my consultation because of my use of Retin-A. I had to discontinue for 2 weeks before my procedure takes place. I look to following up with how things go.< /Review>

John and his team @ The Laser Image Company made me feel comfortable, gave me a clear understanding of the process, and treated me like a person.

<Review>If understanding how to improve the way you look, and feel, is important my only comment is Laser Image folks took the time to explain and not sell. I look better after a few treatments, and feel so young again. Love this place for treating me kindly as I was a little embarrassed at first. It is okay to treat yourself nicely. It took trust. Thank you Char & John!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Always professional and educates me on each service I’m receiving. I’ve never been into my skin care routine until a couple years ago, but now I am always excited to go have a treatment done. I love the laser treatment I get done because there is no down time, but everyone can always tell my skin is glowing after!<//review>

Nurse Adriana did Laser hair removal and lip fillers on me and she was amazing. She is incredibly friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the procedures she is doing. She was able to explain in detail each procedure, the aftercare needed and the results expected. I felt like I was in good hands and definitely will come back for more procedures!</review>

<rating>5</rating><text>I’ve been going to Claudia or Madison for my facials for 2 years now and the difference I see is incredible. I had a period in time where I experienced acne that were similar to cysts under my skin. These left dark scars and severely impacted the look of my skin. 2 years later the scars are gone and my skin is back to looking good.

<Text>The staff is excellent- friendly, helpful, welcoming and experienced- and the treatments I have gotten have all resulted in better skin. I would recommend to anyone who is thinking of getting skin treatments but is a little unsure; that was me for sure and the staff put me completely at ease. They truly act appreciative of your business, respect your privacy and time by taking you right at appointment time, and communicate with you afterwards. You will definitely go back!</Text>< username>

<Review>I visited Laser Image Co Med Spa a number of times and have been treated by my favorite nurse Adriana. She's done an amazing job on my fillers and Botox. She's very smart and very careful with my face. I will continue with nurse Adriana for my future needs, she's a true artist, sharp, and very polite.

I also love the staff, Kayci is always smiling and welcoming.  Thank you Laser Image ❤< /Review><username>Ana Bentley< /username>< Rate>

<text>After reviewing 2 dozen different med spas I narrowed in on 3 local businesses. I liked that this place was owned by a doctor and they seemed to have good success with lots of clients who rave about them. So I went in for a consult today with Nurse Julie for microneedling and I was extremely impressed by both the front desk service as well as my interaction with Julie. Unlike some places that treat you like a body, i felt super welcomed upon arrival and well attended to and Julie is super knowledgeable about the different treatments for skin rejuvenation. She also gave me a clear understanding of what to expect with the treatment and how to get better long lasting results. And she did not try to upsell me on a bunch of additional products I don’t need. I can’t wait to come back next week for the first of three treatments with Julie. Oh forgot to mention their price for the treatment ( with PRP) was extremely competitive!  Don’t hesitate to at least consult with Laser Image before making your decision.<//text>< pics>

I am in the aesthetic industry and have come to Laser Image Center for various treatments that I do not do.  The staff is extremely professional, friendly and experienced.  Adriana the RN,  recently did the new botox called Jeuveau.  She did an excellent job. I have also had CO2 there and laser hair removal.  Highly recommend this great medspa with the latest technology and knowledgeable staff.<//Review>

First impressions are everything and as I soon as I walked in to Laser Image, I received the warmest and kindest hello and welcome at the door, front desk.  Then, I was greeted by my nurse, Nurse Nar!  She is one of the kindest and best Nurses' I have ever been treated by & I have been around the block, so I know a thing or two about injections. Nurse Nar & I discussed my goals, my ideal look, and our plan to achieve those goals and look I had in mind.  Once we completed our discussion, she walked me through the steps.  Then she started the work...Let me tell you, she has the best hand with injections.  A total professional, easy with her hand, very painless; She is phenomenal! I cannot say enough about Nurse Nar, a total artist-with-injections.
Thank you so much Laser Image for doing what you do everyday and providing the highest quality and making us all look SO beautiful!
Looking forward to seeing you all & being treated by Nurse Nar very soon again! :)< /text>

<Text>Came with an expectation of professionalism, but unfortunately was left cold in that regard. Let's not even begin with being treated as if I was a problem and what not. Something as clinical as Botox shouldnt have left me with such a bad experience considering other places I have had it done throughout the years. On the outside and from other reviews i wonder why my experience was less than stellar? Then if you notice? There is a pattern the owner only is kind to those who afford five star ratings and if you are forthcoming about a bad instance they lie and say you never went. This is why I am using a pen name. I have a right to voice when I a client am not pleased. If you can't bother to acknowledge or correct the situation. Anyway for what money is being spent in regards to service and all it was bad. And from what I have heard elsewhere after searching around in case this was just a one off bad instance? It seems that some of the staff is under cooked with experience. Anyway to the owner who will a thousand percent lie and all remember you are violating hippa violation by ignoring privacy freedom here. I won't be stepping foot at this place again get Botox or anything else. There are several other places to go to that are more experienced and that will treat you with much more respect. Also note you can tell some of these reviews are prodded by the company which is weird too (ie whether people who know them or are getting incentives. Most of the 5 star ones are)</Text>< Pictures>

Always such a positive experience. Friendly and knowledgeable front staff and nurses who take their time to answer my millions of questions. They are very thorough and NEVER make me feel rushed like so many other derm and medispa offices do. I've been a client for 5 years now and have been very satisfied with every service. Highly recommended!< /text>

I I'm dissatisfied with med spa. I was in desperate need of hair removal. I completed the recommended 6 treatments and, unfortunately, didn't see a single change. Im no expert,, but the laser technology here appeared super old and dated. I'd suggest putting your money elsewhere.</Text>

<text>My husband bought me a gift certificate from The Laser Company for Christmas. He had no clue what to buy or what I needed. All he knew what that I was tired of shaving. He said they were so helpful in helping him get exactly what I needed. Best gift ever!

The staff is super friendly and always makes me feel so welcomed. I’ve been going to them for a few months now for the hair removal. They make what could be an embarrassing and uncomfortable process an easy, and comfortable experience. I love how they remember little tidbits about me and my previous visits. It’s the little things that make such a big impact.</text>< pics>

We ended up talking the entire time, which was lovely. My skin felt and looked fabulous days after the procedure. Thanks Claudia!</review>

John is absolutely one of the nicest people I have ever met.  He strives to provide excellent service and his entire staff follows the same vibe.  The office is calm and welcoming, and extremely professional.  I had a laser vein treatment and it was truly a positive experience.  The pain was next to nothing, and I was in and out in a reasonable amount of time.  Overall, it was and exceptional experience and I highly recommend visiting the Laser Image Company!!<//Text>

Excellent service. I've been going to Laser Image Company for about 6 months now. I received Hydrafacials from Claudia monthly. Claudia is absolutely amazing. Hands down the best facials I've had. I always want an extra ten minutes. My skin is flourishing under her care. She is experienced professional and  knows a lot about all skin types. Everyone is great! The facility is clean. I also feel so welcomed and comfortable. Hands down the best place for your skin care needs.</text>

<Text>This place is a little gem! I started with an amazing consultation with Danielle. We talked about my skin concerns and what I was looking for. She wasn't pushy or too sales-y, just really informative and super cool. We decided on a facial and a peel, and I also talked about teeth whitening and vein laser treatment. I decided to go for it all. A little splurge! I'm so glad I did it!

It was my first time doing a facial and a peel, so I was a little nervous. But I shouldn't have been- it was really relaxing and refreshing and felt a little tingly afterword. And my results are amazing! Just a week later, my skin looks totally different- softer, shinier, and younger.
Teeth whitening was a piece of cake. Half hour and my teeth are shades whiter- I loved the immediate results.  A lot of people have been complementing me already. The laser spider vein treatment was super easy. No pain. Felt like someone was snapping a rubber band on my leg. Can't wait to wear shorts again.

Staff is super warm and welcoming and laid back and on top of their game.  I'm definitely going back. :)

Ooh! And I went back one week later and got the Infrared Body Wrap. I'm addicted. It was 50 minutes of loveliness- laying there all wrapped up in a little heat, sweating out up to 1400 calories? I mean does it get any better than that?<//Text>< resp>

<Review>Second time there... Wonder why I waited so long to go. I arrived as their last appointment. Front desk was excellent. The RN who did the work was very gentle, kind, courteous I felt she took pride and cared deeply about her work. Would recommend as the work she did was complete and above and beyond what I have experienced else where. Rosacea on my face was what I was teated for.<//Review></record>

Laser Image Company is the only place I will go to for lasers and treatments. Their treatments are subtle and effective. They ask you what your concerns are and recommend only the things they think will help your concerns.
I get amazing results every time, and will go to them for many years to come! It’s so nice when your friends tell you how good you look, but don’t know what you did... right  after your visit to the Laser Image Company:)</text>

< Review>
I have been seeing Danielle (and sometimes Claudia) for at least a couple of years now for monthly facial treatments. Danielle is simply terrific- gentle but very skilled in her approach to hydrating and exfoliating my skin. As a senior now I am trying my best to take care of my skin and combat aging. The hydrafacials and dermaplaning have really helped my skin. The packages you can buy reduce the expense a bit. Both estheticians are wonderful people. You feel welcomed and relaxed during the sessions. The receptionists are also friendly and professional.<//Review>

< review>
My 25 years old daughter had a small double chin. The laser Image Company has been advertising the Kybella treatment for this double chin issue. My daughter went there for consultation a few months ago. She met with John and was told that she is a good candidate for the Kybella treatment and because of her young age she can definitely get the results with one or maximum of two treatments.  When she asked about the cost she was told that the cost is $500 for a vial.  We decided to go ahead with getting one treatment (expecting to pay $500) and hoping to see the results. However, once the injections were complete we were given a bill for $1,000. We asked why we had been charged double for the injection and we were told that they used 2 vials for the treatment. At no point prior to the treatment had they told us that they were going to use two vials and whether or not we would be ok to pay this price. We were very surprised but paid the $1,000 and went home waiting for the results that were supposed to show. Moreover, after 2-3 weeks we still didn’t see any noticeable results. We called and reported the issue but were told we had to wait longer.  After one month there was still no noticeable reduction in her double chin. We called again and finally my daughter got an appointment and went in to discuss the issue. They took a picture of her chin and said they will get back to us regarding the issue once they discuss it with John. After a week my daughter received an email stating that if she wants to get a better result she needs additional treatments. This is really disappointing and upsetting. The fact is that we wasted $1,000 and have seen no noticeable improvement at all. . I am writing this review because I paid the $1000.  I am really surprised with this situation considering the place has a good rating.</review>

I found The Laser Imagine Co, when I was looking for someone who could help me with scar tissue under my lip (formed after a flu outbreak a few years ago). I went to two dermatologist but neither really helped other than to rack up large invoices. I decided to find an alternative because I was tired of feeling embarrassed  by how my lip look and feel. Then, I found Laser Imagine Company. After a consult, we decided to try injecting Restylane into my bottom lip area around where the scar tissue had formed. It worked wonderfully plus the nurse doing the procedure was gentle, confident and helped me stay calm. I couldn't be happier with the results. Now that we are almost “mask free” I can wear the wonderful lipsticks that I love with confidence.

After that success, I decided to try, Micro-needling. I'm 62 and have some little lines and collagen loss. After just the 4th treatment everyone (all my friends say, I've turned back the clock 8-10 years) I'll take it!!  I highly recommend pulling the trigger to try this service. You will be happy you did. Feel free to ask me any questions via DM. I’m happy to help anyone who might be on the fence.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b574d94c9a7:0x4a909d9dd3912b74< /Gmap_id></record>

From the friendly staff to the calming influence of the nautical themed office, The Laser Image Company made an impression on me the minute I walked through their door. I have been so consistently pleased with the results of my laser and injectable treatments that even my move across town to West LA won't keep me away!< /text>

We take pride in making sure our equipment is serviced correctly and functioning at the highest level for our clients. If it is not then it will not be used until it is repaired correctly.'}<//response><Review>Venus Medical Solutions was contacted by the customer concerning striping issues occurring on their customers from the handpiece during treatment. We repaired the striping problem and sent the hand piece back to the customer. The initial problem was not the temp sensor and error never occurred during testing. Although once the customer received the handpiece and used it for a day, the temp sensor error appeared. The customer called Venus Medical Solutions back and said he is now getting a temp sensor fault with the handpiece. Although, we never charged him for that particular issue, we understood and offered to repair the handpiece ( as a courtesy) for free and pay the shipping cost. The handpiece temp sensor error wasn't happening at our facility second time and we couldn't duplicate the error. As a courtesy, because he was down, we sent him a loaner handpiece while we try to resolve the temp sensor issue with his handpiece. He asked if the loaner worked, could he exchange it. We agreed to do that. The customer called 1 week later and said the loaner was not putting out the energy he expected. Again, we paid to have the handpiece shipped back overnight to replace the lamp and reset. Once he received the hand piece the next day, he said the hand piece still was not putting out enough energy and he wanted a refund. We agreed to give him a refund, however, since the loaner didn't work we asked that he send the hand piece back and we would send him back his original hand piece. The customer refused and said he sent the loaner out to be repaired. Even though Venus Medical Solutions policy is like every other company, you must return all merchandise when a full refund is requested. We understood his situation of the waiting period and deeply apologized for the inconvenieces. Therefore, we offered to refund his cost of the other repair company. Which is what he requested we do. ( Although, we were never able to verify that the loaner was not working). The customer thoughts were that Venus Medical Solutions was unreasonable in our request for him to return the loaner and we return him his handpiece in its original condition if he wanted a full refund. We offered to pay the repair cost which we thought was fair considering the circumstances.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I took my friends to get a Botox and filler on a Friday / happy hour: so much fun. People are very nice and professional. They treat us so good ,we didn’t wanted to go.  FIRSTABLE ,  SUCARI WAS GREAT WITH HER MAGIC HANDS YOU WILL FEEL NOTHING VERY GENTEL AND CARING.SHE ONLY DOES BOTOX. She is veryyyyy friendly and understand and explain everything so well. We were amazed when she say they have to call a doctor to verified if my friend can have the Botox done , she take medication for high blood pressure.so the doctor was so nice OMG/He gave us the approval. So we went ahead and did it.  On the way home my friend could not stop taking about the Nurses how professionals they were. Over all I give them 10 stars. We will come back to this place and we highly recommended.no to forget John he is the best 👍 so much patient and calm and taking care of the coustomers so good. I don’t want to forget the good and the wine very gourmet and delicious. Ok thank to all we see again soon. Casandra/ Fanny / Eva  1/12/18👍👍👍👍< /review>< pictures>

Pizza slice was fresh from the oven, asked for crushed red pepper and parmision which they happily abliged. Good flavors and not greesy at all.<//Text>

Solid pizza joint. We've ordered from here numerous times and have never been disappointed. The pizzas are big and taste like pizza...so good job Two Guys!

They usually have a good special with a pizza and wings. Their wings always hit the spot. They aren't the best wings I've ever had BUT they are delicious. They offer a variety of wing sauces. You know when you just want some decent wings? This is the place.

Their customer service is always enjoyable. The dozen times (or so) we've ordered from here, the order taker is pleasant and doesn't make you feel rushed and they always make recommendations. The drivers who deliver are always nice and go over the order.

This is our go to home delivery pizza spot.

Highly recommend :)< /review>

NO masks worn here! Place was overall pretty dirty considering the current situation you would think they would be on top of their PPE and sanitation for their business. Disappointed pizza was super greasy had to wipe the food before eating it. EH< /review>

Outstanding customer service. I called them last night with an incredibly complicated order for a large family event. The person who answered the phone spent fifteen minutes with me and did her best to make sure she was taking down the order correctly. Their estimated delivery time was accurate and the pizza tasted pretty good too. I am very impressed.<//review>

When wslking by the liquor store I seen roaches and then I was hesitant to eat in the plaza entirely. But I already ordered the pizza. Unfortunately if one place has roaches prob the entire plaza is ingested IMO. Anyways we came home we had to rewarm pizza's and cheese sticks. For 45$ that's not cool.<//Text>< response>

It has been over a year, and I have gotten more acquainted with their menu, and have not been disappointed. Recently, an error was made on my order, and the Manager, Jerry, was very generous in his response and offered a generous credit. Today, I spoke to Marilyn and ordered again, and she had all of the notes and credit ready. This is a 180 degree treatment to the rude management at Bonnie B's BBQ on Lake Ave, who hung up on me after telling me "they don't need my business." Two Guys from Italy, will have a regular customer in me, simply because they know how to treat their customers.</text>< Response>

I had the meat ravioli and my daughter had the stuffed calzone.  We ordered through grub hub and it was delicious.  Only draw back was they missed the add salad with the ravioli.  I would order again.  Affordable, delicious Italian food is hard to find.</text>

<text>They were great and had great prices/deals for ok pizza, but seems like it's gotten dramatically worse lately for deliveries. Recently ordered pizza at 3 on a Sunday and didn't get my pizza until 8pm after calling twice to ask where my pizza was - it seemed like each time they didn't even have my order started or anything. By the time the pizza arrived I'd already gotten food from elsewhere and the pizza that came wasn't at all what I ordered - not even close, and was just so bad.</text>< pics>

<user>100400305839088999866<//user><review>Just ordered from Door Dash and 1/2 of my order was missing but I got charged for all of it.  I called Two Guys and the person who answered the phone said, "You ordered ravioli and wings right?".  I didn't tell him what I ordered, and he hadn't checked the ticket.  Yes.  I did order spaghetti, ravioli, wings, and calzones.  1/2 the order was prepared and delivered.  The restaurant charged me $44.  Door Dash charged me $57.00.  When I called Two Guys, he said, "You need to take it up with Door Dash.  Your ticket only says ravioli, spaghetti, two salads, and one calzone".  My question is, how did he know I ordered wings if I didn't tell him and that wasn't on the ticket!? Anyhow.  When I called the restaurant to resolve my issue, I just got a blow off - "you need to take it up with Door Dash".  So basically, "I got mine!  Too bad so sad customer!".  Never ever ordering again from a place that is so dismissive of their customers when they call for help.< /review></record>

This is the best pizza Ive ever had. Hubby and I are visiting from SF and got back to our hotel late Saturday night, hungry. This place was near us and open so we gave it a try. Despite being 10mins to close when we picked up our pizza, the staff was kind and courteous. They were incredibly helpful and hospitable. The pizza was piping hot by the time we got to the room to eat it. The perfect amount of cheeae, sauce, and toppings. With service and pizza this great we will definitely come back.<//text>

I ordered food from grub hub for delivery from Two Guys. My food was 15 min over the time they said it would take and I called to see what was happening. Two Guys gave no apology and was very short with me with "it's on it's way!" after asking my name and phone number. I waited 20 more min then called again as it was getting close to 2 hour since I ordered. The manager was summoned and he put me on hold for 5 min only to tell me that my order was not made. All I got was a sorry and a goodbye. The next day I am now having to try to get my refund as they only refunded the food - not the tax, delivery charge, or tip. Grub Hub tried to help me but could not get them to fix it. We have ordered before and had no problem - but never again. Rude customer service and bad business practices. I am still trying to get my money back.< /Text>

I placed an order for 16” pizza they give me 10” pizza when I call they don’t even offer to fix the order after stating it was his mistake. Insisted I call Postmates for a refund rather than he fix it. Terrible service. Too bad because the food not bad but I will not go back. Luckily blaze pizza is nearby.</text>

Ordered a Philly Cheese Steak.  Meat was overcooked and dry.  Salad or chips were supposed to be included, received neither!  The chicken on the Caesar salad had no flavor, plus dry.
Called and  complained  All I received was an apology!  Not that we'll replace your order.  Was told, we'll make it up to you next time!  Next time??< /text>

<review>We ordered by phone to pick up .My husband had them repeat the order, and told them we were at the hotel across the street. When he brought the food back - no silverware, no napkins, no paper plates to split the salad for 2. Not only that, but I ordered the calzone, a vegetarian one, and sure enough HUGE LUMPS OF MEAT in my calzone - and not the vegetables that I ordered. Maybe they are good if you can eat there, but this was an expensive mess. How do you not include a fork and napkins with pasta dishes?!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Terrible delivery service. Told us after an hour of waiting for it that it was going take two hours. I canceled the order, and they ended up sending someone to my house anyway. Their pizza was seriously mediocre to begin with. Stay away from this place, just order Pizza Hut, their pizza isn't good either but at least they have an idea what they are doing.< /Review>

Multiple late orders from this place. The pizza is decent but with deliveries taking more than 2hrs I will not be ordering from them ever again. I was occassional customer, but that has ended. How are you still in business?</Review>

<Date>1476040925196<//Date><rating>1<//rating><text>Ordered for delivery as a first time customer. Pizza arrived very late. Was ordered at 10:45 and told it would arrive by 11:30. At 12:00 called to check on status and was told it should be here any minute. Pizza showed up at 12:15.
Pizza was hot but not tasteful . . . little to no marinara sauce. Hawaiian pizza with minimal topping . . . we are talking 2-3 pineapple per slice and same with the ham.<//text>< pics>

Don't bother with delivery. You're going to get your food way late. Parking here is very difficult, so unless you're within walking distance, lunch time is a no-go. Not an easily navigable location for wheelchairs (pretty sure it's not ADA compliant). Quality is low, especially for the price.</Text>

They are starting to cut corners and decreasing the amount of toppings.  Thats a sign that the franchise is having financial problems.  Time to find a new pizza place< /text>

<text>They took care of business! They tested my hearing and just like I thought there's room for improvement when it came to my hearing! They took a look inside my ears and saw that there's a lot of wax in my ears that was packed up! They told me to have someone, i.e., a nurse or some professional help with that! I decided to buy a device that vacuums the wax out of my ears and see a professional!  Best decision I've ever made to see them and take their advice!<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0ff8e3ebcb7:0xe0a0046d8f9385de<//Gmap_id></record>

Very professional and polite crew.
From Linda, setting up the appointment for my father.
Veronica, fixing the issues with my fathers hearing aids.
And Susie, who always treats us with respect and makes my father feel very comfortable.

Sue should be an example of how spectacular customer service is.

Her model of service should be taught in colleges.

She genuinely looks out for you and what's best for you!

Something I would never forget.<//text>

My experience with Connect Hearing and Susie Grafman was and has been very good. Susie is not only extremely helpful and courteous she is incredibly professional and knowledgeable.

The difference in my hearing is like night and day. When I put them on in the morning I hear the volume go up and in the evening when I take them the world is quieter. There were some issues with the hearing aids that Susie has addressed and adjusted.

Having hearing isn’t a cure for hearing loss and it is taking some adjustment. My mind is still prioritizing sounds.

The app that comes with the hearing aids not only controls them with my phone but provides communication with Susie. I can tell her about my concerns and set up virtual contact and she can make corrections in the comfort of my home. Susie has assured me that I can reach out to her at anytime and that she will get back to me as soon as possible and she does respond in a timely manner.

One more plus is connecting to my phone and using the hearing aids as Bluetooth earbuds to speak on my cell phone and for duets on TikTok.<//text>

Great service provided by compassionate and highly knowledgeable staff. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of face masks, I was finding it extremely difficulty to understand those around me. This made my work as Speech-Language Pathologist nearly impossible to execute. Thankfully, I was referred to Susie Grafman who was able to see me within days and fit me with hearing aids. The experience has been life changing. I can now communicate effectively with patients, colleagues, family and friends. The hearing aids and care I received have profoundly improved my life. Thank you for the wonderful work you do!<//Review>

Susan was terrific. She took the time to listen to why I was there and didn’t just assume that she knew why was wrong. She was very professional through the whole process.

While I didn’t have a severe issue, she thought that she may be able to help me. She let me try something for two weeks to see if it helped. Even though it didn’t make a marked difference, I wouldn’t have had any other way to find out.

There was no “selling” of any kind. Just genuine help. I will definitely be going back once a year to get checked.</text>

<text>Fantastic experience at Connect Hearing in Glendale. Susie Grafman introduced me to the Phonak hearing aids and helping me along the way to adjust its audio settings to fit my kind of hearing loss (which is not typical). I was able to come back anytime to make any time of adjustment to the hearing aids which helped a lot. I highly recommend their services!<//text>< Pics>

<review>The staff was very professional  every one was very kind.  I would have like to go a bit slower and  communicate with us  a bit better,  because I would have like to discuss if we had other options as far as equipment and prices.  I felt a bit pressure and confuse at times.  But the end result was amazing, my father is very happy and he can now hear so much better and join in the conversations.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c0ff8e3ebcb7:0xe0a0046d8f9385de< /GmapID>< Date>

The ladies at Connect Hearing Glendale are so nice to my grandma, they treat us like family.  I'm amazed at the new hearing aids they have... my grandma is able to hear her phone calls directly on the hearing aids. She is able to hear her tv shows much better. Susie took her time in explaining  everything to us. I recommend this clinic.</Review>

My family and I are very grateful to Susie and the team. They were kind and caring, very knowledgeable and helpful in choosing the right product for us. It took only four weeks to receive the hearing aid (we had been waiting for months in another office). And I can't say enough how pleased I am with their continued care and services. I'm glad we found them and would recommend anyone to Connect Hearing, Susie and her staff.<//text>

Susie and her team simplified the process and asked real questions about my needs. She took time to truly listen and as a result I’m able to enjoy life again. She cares about her patients, and combined with her expertise, she makes sure you’re taken care of every time.
Connect Hearing has also done a fabulous job with post-fitting.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c0ff8e3ebcb7:0xe0a0046d8f9385de< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to the Connect Hearing Glendale office for approximately four years now, under the care and attention of Susan Graffman.  Susan has done a marvelous, outstanding job of ensuring that my hearing aids are tuned properly, fit properly and are the proper model for my hearing aid issues.  I have been elsewhere, and stopped 'hopping around' here due to the excellent service she and Connect Hearing Glendale provide.  I'd give them a 10-star rating if I could.< /Text>

If they had 6 stars I would give Susie an even better rating!  Susie is expert, kind, thoughtful and very, very oriented to the needs of her clients.  Not only do I hear better because of Susie, I leave every appointment feeling better!  I will always recommend without reservation Susie and Connect to anyone!< /Text>

<review>Thanks to Susie Grafman I can hear again for the first time in a long time. Susie talked me into coming to Connect Hearing and trying some hearing aids out and it changed my life. I knew I had hearing loss but I had no idea how much. She figured out the best ones for me and I am thrilled and have a new lease on life. She calls to check in on me frequently to make sure I don’t need any adjustments  and when I do she’s always there and available. Thanks so much to Susie and Connect Hearing!</review>< gmapID>

Susie Grafman, Connect's audiologist, is awesome!  She is highly competent in her work and very kind and empathetic with her clients.  My father, one of her clients, didn't want to admit he needed hearing aids - it was a new phase of his life.  Susie fully understood his emotions and gingerly led him into a new realm of better hearing.  He now loves his hearing aids and is always happy to go and visit Susie and her staff!</text>

Susie (Grafman) is terrific.  She is extremely knowledgeable regarding her versatile product line and she could certainly find the right product for you.  The offices are nice, easy parking just behind the building (90 minutes free) and just a few steps down a tree lined walkway to the front door of the building.  I would recommend checking out the product line that she  has to offer.</text>

<review>Very greatful experience. Went to the Connect Hearing Office in Glendale on Brand with my dad to get his hearing test and his hearing aids checked. Susie Grafman and her assistant are so wonderful and helpful. I recommend these wonderful people and their equipment. Susie does a wonderful job explaining the importance of being able to hear and how it affects us. My  85 year old dad had been having issues with his hearing for the past 3 years and his old hearing aids were not helping out anymore. He got his old pair back in 2007 and they finally gave out this year before going on a long vacation. Didn't know what to do so I bought him what supposively was a hearing aid from a tv commercial that he had seen. That hearing aid was not a hearing aid but an amplifier. My dad had issues with the amplifier and couldn't get it adjusted and it was too sensitive to loud noises. I saw him get so frustrated that he took the equipment out of his ear and threw it across the room. I felt so hopeless not being able to do something for him and for getting him that cheap amplifier. I have seen videos of children hearing for the first time and the parents crying. Well let me tell you that's how I was when Susie Grafman came through with her word. My fathers reaction was priceless and I broke down to tears. Susie said she would have him hearing by Thanksgiving and she did. Thank you so much Susie for being so patient, detailed, understanding and helpful with everything. We couldn't of gone to a better place. You have helped my dad hear and get back to our social functions with no problems. This tuely was a great Thanksgiving and Christmas gift.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Ruby D........  I had curbside service that worked well.  I had a problem with one of my hearing aids. Someone came and took the equipment back up to the office, checked it, and returned it after it was serviced.  However, I needed more instructions as how to avoid the problem in the future.< /Text><name>Carl Derksen<//name></record>

<Text>I decided to call Connect Hearing Glendale because of their selection of brands for hearing aids. I previously went to another office where there was just one brand to choose from. Once I met Susie Grafman, at Connect Hearing Glendale, I was sold. Susie's knowledge, experience, thoroughness, and desire to help clients have better quality of life was reassuring and comforting. Wearing hearing aids was a big decision for me and she helped to put the fear, discomfort, and stereotypes aside. I am extremely pleased with my hearing aids and I highly recommend Connect Hearing Glendale and Susie Grafman.< /Text><user_name>Mei Chun< /user_name><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

I would say a wonderful store, fair prices and very personable people with honest conduct. Very accommodating in regards to religious purchases and will give great deals in regards to that and more. There seems to be a personal vendetta against the store with 1 star reviews as they seem to have no relation to what I have experienced at all</review>

This owner sold me 10 lbs rice bag for $19.99 and the rice is just basic brand not premium kohinoor brand or something. He just rings up the price on computer. I think he just asks customers where are they from or if they are new there. Once he knows it's their first time, he charges them A LOT. Why don't they have prices on items on shelves? Shady. Worst experience.

Neither this store is clean nor packed with quality products, SO WHY IS THIS THE MOST EXPENSIVE INDIAN GROCERY STORE? Can the owner explain that?

To the owner -
And don't reply that I am lying. I just got rice nothing else. I checked prices with other Indian grocery store, they told me you charged way extra. I have my receipt and I'll not hesitate to come and talk if you deny it.

For the people who are giving 5 stars to this store, PLEASE VISIT OTHER GROCERY STORE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF.
ALSO, I FOUND BEST INDIAN GROCERY STORE, IT'S in San Diego county (if you're going to drive). It's called 'Miramar Cash & Carry'. It's like Indian Walmart with best prices and excellent quality products.

I AM NEVER GOING TO THIS STORE IN L.A. EVER AGAIN.<//Text>

I must say, i have had good experiences while purchasing a few things in the past, id really only purchase an or two items at a time. Prices always seemed fair, especially for a small shop like this. However, last time I went in I was on the lookout for several spices to make Masala Chai. Always as helpful, i was led around the shop picking what i need which was great. They showed me my options when they had them and gave me recommendations. When i was finally done they gave me a quick rundown on how to make the Chai as i am a total noob to any of this and finally rang me up.  When i saw the register ring up $81.93 ( which was directly inputted at the register, like if he had been adding up the prices as we were picking the spices, just thought ok he's good with numbers), for some spices and some black tea I was in disbelief. My ignorance coupled with disbelief led me to just pay the bill and walk out the door scratching my head. I didn't want to believe i was taken for a fool as they seemed so friendly and knowledgeable. My thought " why would they want to screw over customers, especially in this economy? I'm sure this is how much everything costs." But the following day was time for me to do Grocery shopping and realized that my grocery store sells Sadaf brand spices which the Indian shop was proudly selling as one of their top brands. Naturally i added the prices of all the same spices and tea i bought at the indian shop including taxes to a sum of a little over $30?!?!?! I definitely feel ripped off tho. What makes this more peculiar was my visit prior to this. When i arrived at the shop the lady was happily explaining things to a couple of a customers, but I believe they were speaking in hindi so of course i didn't understand. But when they were checking out i noticed they were only walking out with one standard size supplement (that i had no knowledge about) bottle yet they were charged a very similar price to what i was charged my following visit. The customers were also surprised, but paid and walked off in the same disbelief.
They are friendly and very helpful, but be careful. Most of their items don't have labeled prices so question the price of everything prior to getting it to the register. They've caught onto the idea that people are much more willing to pay an obviously outrageous price while at the register (having had their emotions preyed on as they explain benefits and what not) rather than if they'd simply pick up the item and asked for the price.

I don't see how this tactic is worth it for them, anyone who walks out with any doubt on what they purchased will most likely just do a check on google for it. They certainly lost one customer.< /Review>

<Review>Every spice, sauce, and dry good you need for a real indian meal at home. The workers even offer great recipes if you ask! It's a hole in the wall for sure, but the best places always are. They accept ebt! It won't break your budget, but it WILL treat your tastebuds. Even the box masala mixes are heaven. Don't miss this place.

<Review>I went to the store in a rush to get some coconut oil and soap, Mani (the owner) was very friendly and helpful. He saw my acne condition and recommended some Ayurvedic medicine to me. He also told me what to do and what not. .I wished I had more time to explore all the products in the market. While I was there, Mani was also helping the other two customers. I saw him holding the shopping basket for them and answering all their questions while helping them choose the products.< /Review>< Pics>

This is my favorite Indian store in van nuys. Superb customer service, very warm nd welcoming store owners. Unlike other Indian stores, royal India spiceland is neat nd clean store.
They have saved my trips to losangeles
As I can get everything here. It is very conveniently located. They carry all the products nd Ayurveda herbs nd oils for long hair.,prices are reasonable Nd spices is very fresh and the owners provide u all the recipes if u need. They gave me a recipe for chicken tikka. I made my chicken tikka with same recipe. It came out so delicious same taste like restaurant style.
A big thumbs up for royal India spice land.</text>

He saw my acne condition and recommended some Ayurvedic medicine (Safi herbal drink) to me. He also told me what to do and what not, and what other things I should take after the 21-day treatment. I wished I had more time to explore all the products in the market. While I was there, Mani was also helping the other two customers. I saw him holding the shopping basket for them and answering all their questions while helping them choose the products. Mani kindly gave me his contact information and told me to ask him if I have any question with the medicine, and he would help me consult with his Ayurvedic doctor in India should my condition not improve.<//text>< userid>

I wish I could give zero stars! I hardly write reviews but I had to write this. I called this place to buy a copper lamp for navratri. They said they have one available and I asked them to keep it for me. When I went there around 8.45 PM before they close the shop, I found that the price on the lamp was $39.99!!
They changed the price tag because I called them and asked them that I am going to buy it!!! Later I came to know that the same lamp was available for $11.99 at another Indian store! This is sad and disappointing.
I have been to the stores couple of times and I used to go there from Burbank. It is obvious and clear that they took an advantage of a person who called them about the lamp and asked them to keep it aside in advance.They not only tripled the price but told me they won’t charge taxes as it is for God’s work!!! They acted extremely suspicious during billing. If you go to any Indian store the lamp is priced around $11.99 & they charged $39.99 for the lamp just because I called them and told them that Navratri is starting from tomorrow so I will quickly come and buy the lamp. Even amazon is selling the same lamp ranges $10 to $15!
I was in rush and in urgent need as the Navratri was starting next day and could not wait for the delivery time! I can’t post the picture on Google but I have posted the picture of the lamp on yelp. You can google the price!
After what they have done to me and rather than asking about the situation they tried  to put the blame on some other (me being from some competing) store is extremely shameful.
To the owner,
I am not from a competitive store. I am a student and a medical professional from india and please put your act together. I called in advance because I didn’t want to waste my time searching for the lamp and go to different Indian stores to find it is not there. I hope you reflect upon your action and realize that it is less about money and more about values and ethics. I trusted you so I bought the lamp
from you. Don’t do this to people!</text>

<Text>It's a great fairgrounds - way bigger than you think it is so you can get in tons of walking. There's an amazing historical horse track that still runs during the fair every year (minus covid times). Tons of events here - always lots of fun - prices are a little steep for basic food fare and beer but it is what it is at big grounds like this.</Text><user_name>Michael Henn</user_name></record>

Then Food Fair was good, I thought there would be more food vendors there.
The Lobster Fries, Turkey Legs and Funnel cakes where very very good.
There is no charge to get in and space for kids to play and plenty of wide open space to eat.<//review>

<time>1616090749648< /time><rating>4</rating><Review>Pros: full hookups at site and level sites. Fairly quiet area. Fairly secure. Easy check-in process. RV parts store and propane sold.

Cons: sites are close together, such that we couldn't extend our awning without hitting the vehicle next to us. Most sites lack shade. No picnic tables, fire pits, etc.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Well planned covid-19 vaccination.
I arrived exactly at the suggested time and this well organized team processed and I was near vaccination tent right at my appointment time (10 minutes from arrival). I did not get out of the car, all done like assembly line. Everything was smooth, they ask to stay in the car for 15 min after the vaccination and timed it, after which they checked everything was OK before giving green signal to leave.<//review>

<text>I went to this location to get a COVID vaccination shot.  As a general rule, I found this fairgrounds to be very easy to get to and get in and out of and the venue is very enjoyable. As a vaccination site, it was really really well run. I barely hit my brakes in my vehicle before arriving at the nurse who gave me the shot.< /text>< pics>

When the Alameda County Fair comes around this is the place to be! These fairgrounds host a very large variety of events throughout the year! There’s a nice horse racing track and golf course. I love how many open buildings and trees there are here!

It’s a good idea to find a parking spot farther away for large events so that you don’t have to pay for parking.<//Text>

Good guys car show was amazing! Maps would have made it more more helpful though as the layout was very scattered over the entire facility. Other than that, great parking and great spot for the show!! Plenty of areas for bathrooms, buildings to enter to cool down and shaded areas to observe various events.  Will be going back for the next one!<//Review>

<Review>The Chinese Lantern Festival 2019 is held at this Fairgrounds with lots of dazzling and glittering lights. The giant dragon with its head moving to and fro welcomes you at the main entrance bringing in China culture and a lot of interesting history. Everything is fantastic, well done! Pricey entrance fees though.. for a family of four you spend more than hundred dollars but I think it’s all worth it because there are gorgeous displays to look around and kids enjoy all the inflatables, mini golf, dinosaur rides, acrobat shows and the gorgeous lanterns!
Lots of souvenirs to buy and food is all around, you can spend a lot of money here..
Parking is not a problem, ample space for visitors. Rest rooms are always cleaned. Worth visiting , great Asian experience!< /Review>< pics>

Went there for the Covid Vaccine, and it was really easy to navigate! Their website made it seem like a hassle, but when I got their I was in and out within 25 minutes. Staff was super friendly and helped make the process as quick and simple as possible. Plus, they helped calm me down when I was about to get the vaccine(I don’t like needles). Overall, a good experience!</review>

<Text>We stayed at his fairground RV Park for five nights to attend the National Storytelling Summit nearby. The staff was courteous and helpful, the hookups were convenient and functional, the nights were quiet. For the area, prices were reasonable. No grass and tight spots were the only drawbacks.< /Text>< Pics>

Beautiful, nostalgic fairgrounds. The aestetic of everything alone is enough of a reason to visit and just walk around. From the quirky foods, to the live animals, to the truck races, this fairground is a classic and must visit location. Took some beautiful pictures during my visit.<//Review>

I live two miles away. $10 for parking is the only thing I don't like. Always great things going on at the fairgrounds. Today is the quilting show and yard junk attraction.<//Review>

Yahoo, yippie, fun, and a hoot. I have been to the Scottish Games here at the fairgrounds..and also, how about this, the fair? Yes, I was at the fair, I will NOT mention the awful situation that happened to ALL many years ago at the fairgrounds, just that, it was scary, that is all. AND the FUN stuff..........

The Scottish Games were a real fun time, there's so much to see and do, yet, keeping in mind when I was here for this event, must have been at least ten years ago. There was many performers at the event. How about the fair?

Fair enough, get the pun? That was funny. Attending the fair one one occasion there was a Christian Rock band Newsboys there. This was when they had made the change to Micheal Tait as lead singer, Tait was previously with DC Talk. The Newsboys are an excellent Christian rock band with a powerful message. One of the better songs they have is 'Gods Not Dead,' which also happens to be the name of some Christian movies, how about that.</review>

<Text>Family fun in the sun
The grab n stay carnival food festival was a blast from the past. All your favorite carnival treats in one safe, covid compliant environment.  Sponsored by xfinity, this was a great treat after being confined for a year. Corn dogs,  churros, deep fried treats,  cotton candy,  kettle corn, turkey legs, and Hawaiian chicken mowie bowls just to name a few.

Here this weekend and next weekend,  too.</Text><gmapID>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9<//gmapID>< user_id>

Easy to walk, no hills or stairs. Rides are fun and well laid out. Food is Fabulous, and a friendly atmosphere.  Lots of places to get out of the sun, staff was very helpful. Map is clear and easy to use.< /review>

This place is huge. There is so much to do and so much to see. It also seems to be about 10° hotter than it would be outside the fairgrounds so be prepared. They offer so many different vendors it was amazing. Make sure to have plenty of money with you because most of the plate of food are ranging in the $15-$20 range. They have plenty of beer and wine and for all the people who love liquor they have two different bar area one at the front which is OK. The one in the back by the horse track race in between the two palm trees is located inside and an amazing bar with amazing bartender. Apparently they were offering Tito vodka but had run out Tito‘s is my favorite vodka so anybody that carries that gets a five star. We had a wonderful time and definitely would go back without children that is if you have children with you it’s a whole different ballgame and my review is based on being kid free. also got to enjoy a concert which was a plus.<//Text>

Awesome place to visit with many MANY food trucks. Definitely recommend the pineapple Dole Whip and of course having a turkey leg! Everyone was helpful, for the most part and plenty of games and rides to really get your money worth. They also have senior discount (62+) . All around a fantastic day for every age.< /review>

Fascinating arts, crafts and hobby displays created by passionate  community members, young and old, that are judged with live commentary at the Fair. Hands-on demonstrations of old-time printing and weaving methods. Livestock shows with live judging of cattle, goats, and sheep raised by 4-H kids. Big-time horse racing is  colorful spectacle. Ride the huge ferris wheel in the day for grand views of the Tri-Valley, and at night for the bright lights of the midway.< /Review>

Awesome place to be with the family. A lot of rides for kids, a few rides for teens and adults. They have a small animal exhibit, an outdoor theater for shows and musical. They have a lot of food stalls that are expensive, but I believe it's worth it. I would be coming back here next year to visit this place.<//Review>

<Text>When the Alameda County Fair comes around this is the place to be! These fairgrounds host a very large variety of events throughout the year! There’s a nice horse racing track and golf course. I love how many open buildings and trees there are here!

It’s a good idea to find a parking spot farther away for large events so that you don’t have to pay for parking.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Hot during the summer. Went to the fair. A lot of things to see and do. Cocktail fest was great. $40 for all you can drink shots for 3hrs plus free shot glass to take home. Couldnt beat that with a stick. Horse racing is also exciting. Kids love the horses! Alameda county fairgrounds always has great events. Even have a golf course!</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Came here for the alameda county fair! Overall great experience but expect a lot of traffic in the parking lot, also the parking lot is HUGE so if you park far then your walk to the entrance will take a while!
It’s easy to navigate around in the fairgrounds, there’s a lot of vendors & food! The fairgrounds is fairly big so wear your comfy shoes since you will be walking a lot!
A lot of things to do here, so it’s great for family or just with friends.</review><GmapID>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /GmapID><user_name>Ashli Chen< /user_name>< pics>

Not worth the money or time.
Food was horrible.
Grab n go food fest was only about seven food vendors.
18.00 for fish and chips.
Greasy.<//Review>

Went to the Metallica pre recorded concert. It could have been a little more organized and should have had food trucks available but since Covid I understand. Screen for showing should have been bigger in my opinion<//text>

How does that quote go? Life is what you make of it. It's already a given these fairs will cost you more than a shiny penny. Your here for that summer fun and you know at times it's ok to spend more for those memories!

Towards the opening of the County Fair there weren't too many visitors yet. A plus for us to park in the front. I suggest remembering the letter on the post when you park. We were totally walking in circles looking for our car!

There is an information booth in the parking lot and right when you enter. Take one to help you find what your looking for sooner or you can just explore like we did! This fair is smaller compared to others, but I prefer it that way.

If I'm being honest, the food we chose was just alright. There were other things I wanted to try that looked better than our monster corn dog and churro ice cream dessert. I'll come for you next year!

There were enough attractions for both live and walking through to enjoy, but these were my favorites.

The "Farley Park," was a nice small walk through that featured the work of others. For those who like flowers and garden landscaping, will appreciate this part of the fair. There are even benches for ones who would like to take a break from walking.

The motocross at the action sports area will get you excited and want to cheer for these guys! The louder you are the more dangerous tricks they will perform. You can also get an autograph for $10. I'll be sure to do that the next time I come around!

Those All Alaskan racing pigs are adorable and was one of the highlights for the day. Who knew this event could bring such smiles to both the little ones and adults! I also like how they make it interactive for the guests as well.

On a last note thank you Yelp for the generous tickets and a day of summer fun and laughter!< /Text>

The Alameda County Fair is a family tradition of ours. The rides, music, booths, rides, people, shows, shopping, food, exhibits, and of course all the rides.  They have an awesome garden exhibit, and an animal exhibit too. Plus an art show and plenty of food, drinks, and desserts.  Wonderful people, sights, and a great experience for everyone.  We always enjoy ourselves every year.</text>

Holidays and Lighted Lanterns
Christmas and New Year celebrations in America are usually for families and friends getting together to enjoy feasting and gift giving. Decorations are often full of colors and lights. Families do not often go out at night but stepping out to look at bright colorful lanterns that are larger than life size can be worth while during the holidays. Chinese handicraft with childhood fantasies of animals, castles, creatures light the night and fascinate our imagination. Cool night air for walking around, taking photos, eating street food, shopping handmade jewelry and decorations, plus watching acrobats complete the family experience.<//review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><rating>4</rating><text>The co2 from all the generators in the midway will make you sick. The food is standard fair food. Although the portions seem to be greater than I remember as a kid but that's the way America is moving isn't it?  The lack of flavor doesn't justify the price of the food. Kids will have a good time. Lots to see when there's event going on here. Horse racing, Live stock, agriculture, arts and crafts, t-shirt painting, model trains, wood carvings, petting zoo and much much more. Including musical acts that were big when you were a kid! WOW!</text><user_id>107393945530875098915< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

Always a blast coming here! We frewuent thw fairgrounds quite a few times every year and we have always had fun! Last time we went was about 3 weeks ago when we went to the Train Day. Ended up finding a nice working train for $10 for my 2 year old and he loves it! Fun times!<//text>

We had a great time here. There's plenty for all ages that is included with the cost if admission. Of course there are the extras that every kid will be begging for, but it's also possible (if you're strong enough not to give into those little pleas) to have a great time at a reasonable price. We watched a horse race, saw X-Games winners do crazy stunts, watched pig races, petted farm animals and watched drummers, acrobats and magicians.< /Text>

<text>We went here for The Good Guys Car Show & Swap Meet. It’s a great experience for the whole family! There are so many beautiful show cars and they even have some for sale! Their swap meet is where you can find those hard to find parts for any car and maybe get a little muscle car expertise as well.

On another occasion, we also attended the Night Food Market. That was such an amazing experience! So many good vendors to choose from! Lots of drink vendors too! Bring the whole family to come and try the different food they serve. My husband ate Bone Marrow that had actual 24k gold in it! They even put some in their Ice Tea!! It was awesome!!  There were lots of people in line so buy your tickets online and get there early so you’re first in line. Parking is usually $10.  We had an amazing time!

I highly recommend both events. The fairgrounds are so nice and well kept.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /gmapID>< name>

4th of July was interesting,  they closed the gates at 6pm, we waited almost hour and a half to park. Had we not purchased online tickets we would not have been able to enter. Paid 30 bucks at 615 :( on the bright side we had just missed the mini riot in the ride area.

Fair food was decent, the retail selection was blah. Usually they have good products to choose from but this year sucked lol

The fireworks made up for all the BS, we watched from our private 30 dollar parking spot ;)</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We love the ACF! They work hard to keep the fairgrounds very clean and full of great exhibits. They offer many different discounts depending on the day of the week so if you have ever served the country, can donate canned food, or want unlimited rides before 5pm, check their calendar. They have many bands that play but we've never stayed for it.

One of the biggest draws has to be the All Alaskan piglet races, we make a beeline for them every year! The Chinese Acrobat show is also fantastic, and the food assortment is decent considering it isn't just row after row of corndogs, fries, turkey legs, and cotton candy/frozen lemonade. They have Italian, Mexican, Asian, American BBQ, Mediterranean by way of gyros, to name a few. The only gripe i have us not enough rides for the 'inbetween' little ones (age 4-6), and also the midway is painted black, so not only are you roasting in the heat but your kids get filthy as hell. Other than that, we love the Alameda county fair and look forward to it every year.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ7JDhdMt1aNB9SCjgaIiRRuOYSANeWt7JHpkJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeRUOrAhl0aY32N88wDF2SMudSFkOqQWKGtOSN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa5mzlBY3-xdvTgcu-UdypVgdMlTC9Jc5Zj-c-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzcq5aQxB8c-mu0YQlS42CTVm7xgE0bRKmrsnK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpIdWKIa_9iyk3j9ijUNR-ToYeHv8MqbKvU1er=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO33lcxhQQKa5XYEONXKLQjeNAh-EuypAdv4qYg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgeFBtF52EVW5FqUS1ZD2y97C3dp2o7WliYL4u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYhFFnyksut9xgr_nYaxhOz-nh7-VHRwKoOfea=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpJV--Xj3V2B7wZ8gKmf9bxy_0lRTiyt_m8m97=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeONUG6SfgoT22ShQ8X7NBFYP0oNsPH2Mx5Xtx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaGZkz5kAvKl5Lo1zcTVrT7WUFXg4gpCKjfUjS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRlE9ui-2X0wiV5hQPGj8xAANCAwIHR8qBChRt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM95dhysixanfUFEgZIIjysTEuERNLWPpOx_b5j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx0GdvadkCt3goh1xu5g5pfywJAwax0yiEa-Yi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORGpk8uTQMwoYSOvxZLzWxWNtVtMtj20dw3R1S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I went for the Chinese Lantern Light Festival, the festival itself was very interesting. They serve your typical fair food and the grounds appeared well kept. Parking is quite a distance from the actual venue, but there is a little tram that runs periodically. Overall it was a good experience.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNssspX-uQBP8eq-WO7gsA28RPnNUjbbzq6WQN8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP84JsJDCNEEc8KVs3G3Wx3fMfaC5RvcTk4HljX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJdSZ56y-PAO-xP3LjBo65243OLnNqMz6LkRyy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoEwqbXD3AK033Gpy9uH2s3LouQBRmks83CG6t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<rating>4<//rating><review>We went for the night market event here. The venue is pretty large and the event is way at the back and on the other side of the parking lot . It took around 20-25 mins walk from parking lot to the event site. Good thing, the staff provide golf cart to transport people back and forth. Overall, nice and large recreation area</review>< Pictures>

Halloween bounce review: Great!  Caring and alert staff, many activities.  Reasonably priced, just read the whole list because the bundles save alot. Stayed 3x longer than I had estimated, and then had to drag the twins away.<//Text>

You have to pay for parking aside from ticket, rides, food etc.

But you will find some of the best carnival food here because every booth is competing 👌 lots to see & tons of lights & rides.🎢🎡🎠I</Text>< Pics>

Night Market where food vendors come from Southern California, only thing about this location is it is too hot during the day time in the summer heat... For the night market though come early or you'll regret waiting in long lines and finding parking, plus the walk to the entrance then going through a check point... Early bird people are the winners<//Text>

<text>An excellent experience. God truly blessed America on this, the most patriotic, day. The sun shone bright and everyone was having a great time, eating turkey legs and pork chops on a stick. The horse races were a raucous affair. There could have been more stars and stripes though. I would have liked to see everyone carrying the flag.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I had a good time with my family.  The food was good. Although my body wasn't feeling it days later. Only because I don't eat that way. There were many food vendors and the lines were crazy long.<//review>

RV show was great, they could of had more A class coaches. Now charging 18 dollars to get in. I think that's a little high. Don't know if I'd go back at that price.<//Review>

Fun place. Traffic and parking really tests your patience. I would recommend coming closer to sunset as there seemed to be less traffic, but also because it would be much cooler temperature, making it more enjoyable.< /text>

Really nice fairgrounds; lots of big, old trees; lots of grass, lots of shade. Friendly, lots of families, great location off 680; easy in&out; parking right by entrance gate. Oh, and lots of cool events like the Good Guys Hot Rod Show and Swap Meet< /Review>

RV park review.  Only game in town on this side of the Bay.  But spaces are tight but quiet at night.  Facilities are clean.  Trash cans were over filled not sure why.  Dumpsters weren't.</Text>

Great location near downtown and close to a lot of amenities.  A little small and cramped but in the middle of the fairgrounds.</text>

Great fair food and games. A little disorganized inside the fair. Get tickets and parking from Groupon or livingsocial so its cheaper.</review>

Do not go to Norcal night market！Super crowded! They don’t limit people! Horrible organization&event！Line is super long for food! At least a hr for paying a single food only and another wait for food. Dirt is everywhere in the air! What a waste of time and money!!! We ended up having food somewhere else!</Review>

Great Fair. Plenty of parking, lots of rides. Lots of children's rides and horse racing. Been coming here every year since I was a kid. Over time some things have changed but it's still a fun time. Ate the best corn dog ever!</Review>

Attended the Alameda County Fair and was pleasantly surprised. I plan on attending from now on. It was the best fair I've been to in a long while. It was NOT crowded but it felt like it was well attended over the THREE weeks that it runs. Parking was more than fair at $10 for the day, most parking spots were under tree cover, thus shaded most of the day.
Plenty of exhibits indoors & out. Lots of opportunities for you to see and check out animals large and small. The shopping was pretty fair. If you get a chance, try the fresh apple juice blends from Hidden Star Farms. It was FANTASTIC! Also there were TONS of food vendors, lots of different options, not just the usual fair food.
Be sure to check out the model railroad & vintage farm equipment displays, they are interesting and fun to watch. Lots of small things to keep little ones involved and interested. Definitely a family friendly fair!<//text>

This year was very fun! Lots of shows. The grounds were very clean. Lots of cute baby animals. 4 stars for plastic straws and no compost waste. The county fair can do better.< /text>

To the people that didn't line up for the bacon wrapped pork belly, I thank you cause that was ridiculously delicious and had it more than once. The food was amazing, the vendors with the different types of seasoning and spices, the different flavors of balsamic vinaigrette, you're the real MVP's. It's probably the biggest County Fair I've ever been to and I definitely want to go again.</review>

<Review>Very nice! Was there for the Good Guys Car Show. Facility is always well maintained and it is always a great time. If the cars aren't your thing, they have great parts and craft vendors near the margaritaville and kids fun zone bounce house, clown, and face painting. So much to see not possible to see it all.< /Review>< Pics>

It is an awesome place to be at every year. A lot to see, play and eat for the whole family. You could spend all day here and still not able to see everything. Just buy a wrist band for $30, and they could ride all day. FUN.< /Text>

My son also loved the Alaskan pigs race. It was very cute and entertaining 👍😁He insisted to watch it twice, hoping to be picked as a volunteer but no such luck, although the adults sitting next to him pointing him out to be picked 😔. Well we did get him a big plush pig to take home. We hang around the farm animals and petting zoo for a while also.< /review></record>

Came here for thre Alameda County Fair today.  Way bigger than I thought it was when I arrived,   I appreciated the many food spots which meant you never had to wait that long in a line for food.  Could do with some gluten free or vegetarian options for more variety of diets to be observed. Was very fun!</Text>

Do not go to Norcal night market！Super crowded! They don’t limit people! Horrible organization&event！Line is super long for food! At least a hr for paying a single food only and another wait for food. Dirt is everywhere in the air! What a waste of time and money!!! We ended up having food somewhere else!< /Review>

Fun place. Traffic and parking really tests your patience. I would recommend coming closer to sunset as there seemed to be less traffic, but also because it would be much cooler temperature, making it more enjoyable.<//review>

<Text>This was a nice place for a tradeshow but I was shocked to have had to pay for even a basic plastic tablecloth and parking as a vendor. Facilities were clean and the staff were great though. Concessions were really pricey. I appreciated the separate vendor parking area. That was really nice.< /Text>< Rate>

<review>I've gone to the Alameda County Fair the last few years, and it's worth the trip. Lots to do, great food stands, horse racing(if you're interested in it), and a lot of shopping. Seems like they're adding new stuff every year, which is awesome.<//review>< gmapID>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I love all the activities they offer here throughout the year. Easy to navigate around the fairgrounds. Parking and handicapped accessibility are huge problems. Prices can be really high, but they do offer several discount days. Food and drink prices way to high. You might be better off packing a lunch and drinks, and limiting food purchases to special treats.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you're a mom with a small child at least 36 inches tall, there's the livestock competitions, displays of art work that won ribbons, ponyrides and trains, and other fun, less dangerous rides.  There's also a free concert area. The grilled food looks and smells amazing.  If you eat there you won't regret it.  Though this year I brought my own food, as well as food for my son, since I'm on a tight budget.</Text>< Pics>

Good time at the Alameda County Fair! The rides, though short and expensive, were so fun! Got my hair curled and styled. Had a whole body massage in a chair from the future, and a fire works display that was like the fourth of July. Got to watch Blake Shelton song his gorgeous heart out.
Felt like a kid again.< /Review>

Great place to spend a whole day having fun. I loved the rides and the carnival game. Local artists and lots of other vendors have set up stalls. Loads of stalls selling yummy food. The county fair goes on for 18 days. Get your tickets now.</text>

Fun for the family, but once it turns dark, be careful. The "ride" side of the park attracts the young, who can be there for the wrong reasons.< /Review>

Very nice! Was there for the Good Guys Car Show. Facility is always well maintained and it is always a great time. If the cars aren't your thing, they have great parts and craft vendors near the margaritaville and kids fun zone bounce house, clown, and face painting. So much to see not possible to see it all.</Review>

Came here for thre Alameda County Fair today.  Way bigger than I thought it was when I arrived,   I appreciated the many food spots which meant you never had to wait that long in a line for food.  Could do with some gluten free or vegetarian options for more variety of diets to be observed. Was very fun!< /review>

<review>To the people that didn't line up for the bacon wrapped pork belly, I thank you cause that was ridiculously delicious and had it more than once. The food was amazing, the vendors with the different types of seasoning and spices, the different flavors of balsamic vinaigrette, you're the real MVP's. It's probably the biggest County Fair I've ever been to and I definitely want to go again.</review></record>

<text>Went to the Bay area Pet Fair was surprised on how many people bring their own dogs to this fair with the heat & hot pavement on their paws. Thankfully for the ones that had strollers or wagons for their dogs & dog shoes for the big dogs to protect their paws. Very hot for all the dogs.<//text><Rating>3</Rating>< date>

<Text>It is an awesome place to be at every year. A lot to see, play and eat for the whole family. You could spend all day here and still not able to see everything. Just buy a wrist band for $30, and they could ride all day. FUN.<//Text>< Pictures>

As usual prices from food vendors are a little high. Atmosphere appeared to be safe with plenty of security as well as local sheriff. Entertainment is good. My fiance and I had a very good time.Stayed well past sundown… Everything felt so much better then.<//text>

It was fun and there is a lot of stuff to do but it is very expensive but if you conserve your money it will be well worth it.  There are many free activities to do as well and it is very family friendly.  Sometimes the staff are very rude and obnoxious.< /review>

The weather was...🔥Lines not that long, rides scary and twisty as they should be. Wide Variety of food choices and to escape the heat the Race Track beckoned...my horse 'Gotham Desire' came in 3rd. Had a lot of fair time fun that brought back a lot of memories from my yesteryears.< /Text>

<Text>Came here for the NorCal Night Market.    $10 parking $5 entrance fee

There was a lot of cute booths for shopping and games, but the food lines are incredibly long......price for the food is way over priced.  Imagine paying $12 for a glass of beer the size of Grande Starbucks coffee.

We enjoyed the music more than anything and of course seeing friends.<//Text>< UserId.>

We had not stayed here before & were surprised at how small each site is. Some are hard to get into with either a trailer or Class A/B RVs. It’s almost all gravel with very little grass in the camp area which made it hotter. I do have to say the shower/restrooms though a little outdated were very clean.  Staff were very nice each time I had questions. We would stay here again if it was only 2/3 days but not for the 7 days we were there.</review>

This huge annual car show covering acres of indoor and outdoor car expo area should not be missed. Hours of walking around appreciating so many labors of love. The most beautifully restored classic, vintage, muscle cars, you name it. The auto-related flea market there is where to look for just the right vintage part to restore your car, or to check out other Americana or  memorabilia.
Hints, Remember to stay hydrated in the heat, bring plenty of cash for parking and carnival-food, and to stay hydrated. Come early to miss the heat, and walk around before the crowds arrive.< /text>

Growing up in MN this is as good of a fairground experience as any.  Classic fare of fair foods but a bit on the commercial generic side.  Would love to see this stepped up for personality and more mom/pop flavors presentation and taste but that's not to say there aren't some real winners in their offerings.  Specifically I loved the tots n brisket I ordered which were fantastic, and there's definitely an array of interesting fair only kinds of foods you'll find.  Alameda County Fair is great because it also has the traditional offerings like county art, baking competitions, farm animal and plant competitions, etc.  This year we were even treated with legit horse races and betting.  Worth a trip but come early for parking and look for Groupon deals which are a significant savings over the door prices.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><review>No guidance when we arrived late close to midnight. Guard told us to drive around to another gate, which was a little helpful but not really. We met a man who helped guide us to the right location, but it seemed more like he was a guest then a worker, without him I doubt we would have found the pickup location as there was no clear sign and the email said nothing about exactly where to pickup the lot number and other information.
Once we got there a huge tree was in the back of the lot which made connecting power almost impossible.
When we arrived to use the restrooms at around 00:30 one of the sinks was overflowing in hair and a toilet in poop and paper, both unusable. The toilet and sink were NOT cleaned before we left again at 10:00. Asides from the price being cheap it was the worst experience in an RV park so far.</review>< pics>

<Review>Every year the fair implements another charge or fee. The free concerts are no longer free. Last night the band on the main stage never even showed up. I wonder if they will reimburse people or if they'll use some hidden clause to keep the money. I used to rave about this place to everyone I came in contact with. No more. It used to be the best. Not so much anymore.< /Review><resp>None<//resp></record>

Over 100 years of county fairs, horse racing, over priced carnival games you will loses at, and rides.  Same things every year. Parking is expensive, admission is reasonable.

Safety -  There was a shooting at the fair in the past so they implemented screening with metal detectors.  But what they don't monitor is that a weapon can be passed through the fences.

During the day it can and does get very hot.

Will all of the drawbacks, it's still worth attending.< /review>

<Review>Went to the dinosaur exhibit with the kids and they had a blast. Could have had a little more added to the dinosaur theme and  possibly some tour guides to offer more opportunities for the kids to become educated on what they were looking at and enjoying. And last but not least some free rides.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I went during the Night Market. Clean given the amount of people that come in and out. The layout is nice and had a great time. Lots of merchandise vendors and food vendors.

It was lacking in the variety of food options though. Would like to try traditional foods instead of fair food.< /Review>

It's fair time! This year the fair seems more open, which is nice! There use to be more things "crammed" in that are not there now and makes for a nicer walk when going around the grounds. There are alot of food choices too, different things this year, so that was exciting. They have the shuttle if you need it to take you to the gate or back to your car again, which is nice. (We used it after the fair, when your feet can use the rest.) Parking folks were nice and were on top of directing traffic.< /Review>

Absolutely unknowledgeable management of organization events. A lot of guests and just one entrance with the metal detector is. After the metal frame some "company" organized customer registration and Mr.Agrassive sales asks you to do that very not polite. Just ignore him. I was in Sacramento. This light installation in Sacramento is better than Pleasanton's copy. We paid 100$ (+10$parking) for three tickets and two were for attractions. In reality this place has three attractions...fraud. Extremely don't recommend this fake festival!!!< /Review>

The weather was...🔥Lines not that long, rides scary and twisty as they should be. Wide Variety of food choices and to escape the heat the Race Track beckoned...my horse 'Gotham Desire' came in 3rd. Had a lot of fair time fun that brought back a lot of memories from my yesteryears.< /text>

I took a group of Mentally challenged adults. Asked their homes for money so they could all buy lunch. Went on first day Fri. BIG MISTAKE! Missed the first gate & due to parade my GPS had us go in curcles,so finally getting to the first gate we were an hr after it opened. Now I have to find food each want. No one had fries. All only had a brick for 13$ a Hot Dog or Hamburger 10!Dollars! Nothing on them nothing special. Never again! By the time we all ate walked 2 buildings time for us to leave. I don't know if I'll take them again.  Just because you offer free entry don't rip ppl off w/food that is nothing special & not that good. I had the foot long corn dog. Never again it was not that good.If I take them again we will eat before we get there.<//text>

We're at the Hula festival ! Having so much fun! It's some great dancing hula . If I did some moves like that, I think I'll break something. These girls and yes guys can really shake it.. Two large stages, and yes, my favorite ,Food. You can eat, eat eat, and drink some killer Captain Morgan Hawaiian yummies . It's the bomb! Don't drink and drive !  Kids area , also. Trackless train and jumpers. They got it all. Hurry, last day!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Went for fathers day, I got in for free and my son did too because anyone e under 6 year old is free. Wasn't too hot, nor crowded, went from like 1230pm to 4pm. Good size line coming into the fair around 4pm. Parking was $10, food, drinks, and rides of course are the same ridiculousness. Had some new rides, lots of rides, seemed like more than usual. A good water log ride, short but sweet. DO NOT GO IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE, biggest joke ever, I couldn't believe it, a couple turns in the dark, then a projector of 3 zombies on a wall and then two more turns, and you're out. Smh. Lastly though, from getting off the freeway to the entrance which is like 3 or maybe 4 short stop lights. It took about 30 mins. People just blocking intersections to make sure they get through the green light or red light. That was the worst part for me, having to keep my composure in front of my son, of ignorant, oblivious, selfish, inexperienced, and distracted drivers. Other than that, great time!<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>Not a bad place to park if you can't get a spot anywhere else.  Big, easy access spaces but  it's dusty when there is any kind of event it the fairgrounds. There was a weekend-long event there that lasted till 1130 at night. Also, no pool, no cable.<//review></record>

Had a great time seeing Sheila E.. The food  is priced so outrageously high that you may want to eat a big meal before going.  Overall it was a fun time.< /Review>

<Review>Went to the dinosaur exhibit with the kids and they had a blast. Could have had a little more added to the dinosaur theme and  possibly some tour guides to offer more opportunities for the kids to become educated on what they were looking at and enjoying. And last but not least some free rides.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Parking was good (some shade even!) and the staff was friendly and courteous.  We went for the AlCo Fair, and it was well laid out, and fairly easy to navigate, with the colored lines on the ground and signs throughout.  Lots of things for kids to do too!<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>It's fair time! This year the fair seems more open, which is nice! There use to be more things "crammed" in that are not there now and makes for a nicer walk when going around the grounds. There are alot of food choices too, different things this year, so that was exciting. They have the shuttle if you need it to take you to the gate or back to your car again, which is nice. (We used it after the fair, when your feet can use the rest.) Parking folks were nice and were on top of directing traffic.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Just took the family to the Alameda County Fair on Saturday 6/28.....what a great time! Nice clean grounds, plenty of shade under the big trees and all the fair food you could ask for! We were there from noon to 9 pm and saw most of everything with some time spent relaxing at a table in the shade. Don't miss the freestyle motocross and the hypnotist! Also, be sure to check out a race at the horse track!!

It really is the best county fair around the bay area!<//review>

As usual vendor rental costs are sky high. That means what items the vendors sell are high if the vendors are to make profit , pay for their gas and time. Consequently I didnt buy much. Way too costly for me.  The selection of food and non food items for sale was awesome. The best customer service and friendliness I found was in the small animal building. Next was the building where mattresses are sold. The workers in the info booth by the yellow gate couldn't answer questions or solve issues when patrons had trouble scanning the show ticket website. At least 4 patrons in 10 min had trouble getting the process completed. Guest services was able to help however.  The firework show was quite good. The security check and admission areas were efficient and friendly and professional.
I was unhappy with the lack of energy from the musicians in tonight's show ( Jun 28, Fri guest group) I watched for 15 minutes and was bored the full time and so I left. On the other hand,  I loved the Loverboy show on 6/21. The band and singing and presentation was really good. They made the crowd glad to be there at the show. I felt the unity between audience and performers
Way to go!!
I liked seeing roving security and felt safe while on the grounds at all times.  Thank you, Susan Moss, Hayward resident.</review>

<time>1529370417195< /time><review>This fair is always a popular place for families throughout the Bay Area.  This year was no exception.  The fair is open every day and closed for Monday and Tuesday.

Parking here is another issue all by itself.

If you plan on driving here, arrive early because vehicles are backed up for blocks before the opening.

Most of the lots get pretty full around the noon hour.

The first day we came here the lines stretched for 3 blocks.  We later discovered that the first day of the fair was "free!"

On fathers day, dad's got in for free, which overall saved families the price of a drink which were way over priced!

Parking will set you back $20.00 for vehicles and $10.00 for motorcycles, a round the ACE train station.

Signs went up all over the surrounding neighborhoods of no parking during fair hours.  Can't really blame the residence who reside here.  I wouldn't want a lot of cars all over my front yard and blocking my driveway.

The day we were here there was a tow truck nearby towing a vehicle, which was probably blocking a driveway.

There is something for the whole family but being the dollar$.  He's a few of my recommendations before you arrive at the fair this year.

Stay hydrated
Comfortable shoes
Sun tan lotion
Plenty of money

Different events are held here periodically. I came to the fairgrounds for a viewing of an movie created by the deaf community (which was pretty great). Numerous other events take place here as well and you can always look up online for what events or activities will be happening in the near future.<//text>

Everything is very expensive but I went with my dad and my brother on father's day and had an awesome time. Parking was $10 and tickets $15 each but my dad got in free because he's a veteran. The rides are about $5 each and food and drinks are expensive ($14 for a 24oz can of beer, $8 for a soft serve cone) but there's a lot you can do for free once you're inside. The model train and agriculture exhibits are cool and the horse races are fun. There's also all types of deal days so look for them online.< /text>

<name>royalsamurai1< /name><text>This fair is always a popular place for families throughout the Bay Area.  This year was no exception.  The fair is open every day and closed for Monday and Tuesday.

Parking here is another issue all by itself.

If you plan on driving here, arrive early because vehicles are backed up for blocks before the opening.

Most of the lots get pretty full around the noon hour.

The first day we came here the lines stretched for 3 blocks.  We later discovered that the first day of the fair was "free!"

On fathers day, dad's got in for free, which overall saved families the price of a drink which were way over priced!

Parking will set you back $20.00 for vehicles and $10.00 for motorcycles, a round the ACE train station.

Signs went up all over the surrounding neighborhoods of no parking during fair hours.  Can't really blame the residence who reside here.  I wouldn't want a lot of cars all over my front yard and blocking my driveway.

The day we were here there was a tow truck nearby towing a vehicle, which was probably blocking a driveway.

There is something for the whole family but being the dollar$.  He's a few of my recommendations before you arrive at the fair this year.

Stay hydrated
Comfortable shoes
Sun tan lotion
Plenty of money
Patience<//text>< date>

Nice area and nice staff, with great selection of food and activities. Only problem is its highly inflated prices and questionably safe rides; it looks like it's barely maintain at legally operational level.< /Text>

Everything is very expensive but I went with my dad and my brother on father's day and had an awesome time. Parking was $10 and tickets $15 each but my dad got in free because he's a veteran. The rides are about $5 each and food and drinks are expensive ($14 for a 24oz can of beer, $8 for a soft serve cone) but there's a lot you can do for free once you're inside. The model train and agriculture exhibits are cool and the horse races are fun. There's also all types of deal days so look for them online.</review>

<review>Great RV park, security is excellent and the service is very good as well.  There's laundry, an RV store with propane, and plenty of space to ride bikes. The only negative is that the spaces are ridiculously close together but they do have all three hook ups<//review>< pics>

< review>
One bad apple ruins the whole bunch. Shawn Martinez a employee of The Mattress Firm snatched the mattresses remote out of my daughter’s hand which is considered assault. Witnesses saw him during his out lash. He then started recording me on his cell phone once I complained to his coworker about him. I asked if he was recording me he said no. But I looked over at him and he kept ducking behind the displays and hiding the phone when I looked at him. When I walked over to report him to his coworker again he ran off and hid. When I spoke to the coworker she initially apologized because she was still trying to get a sale. When she realized Shawn had ruined those chances she flipped an attitude with us and stood behind his behavior. We dropped the issue and moved over to the Verizon station. We were still near the bed since they were across from each other. Shawn walked over took the remote from off the bed and hid it to make a point.

I asked for the supervisor and she said they didn’t have one onsite but I could call this 800 number. She pulled out her phone and Googled the customer service number. I told her I could have done that. I needed a direct supervisor. She again said that there was not one.

I walked over to the second building and found they had another vendor location and saw the lady I had spoke with there. She was talking to a “supervisor”. She saw me, rolled her eyes, and walked away. At that moment I knew they had both ran over to the supervisor to complain about what happened. I walked up to the same guy she was talking to and asked if they had supervisors. He said he was one of the on-site supervisors. By this time I was hot.

I told him everything and he admitted neither one of them should have treated my daughter or myself in that manner. He said he would speak with them then continued to try and sale us on the mattress. I told him my sister is on the rides and that ship had sale because Shawn assaulted her 9 year old niece. No thank you sir.<//review>

Went here for the July county fair and there was zero vegetarian food! I got a burrito without the meat but it was so dry! They didn’t even add any salsa or sauce. The rides were fun but the staff weren’t enforcing rules like keeping hands inside the rides and not holding phones.< /text>

Alameda County in the Pleasanton/Livermore area is beautiful on a Sunday afternoon. My destination was The Pleasanton Fair Grounds! Evan on a Sunday commute from Sacramento to Pleasanton expect heavy traffic at times for sure. But we'll worth it.</text>

Awesome place. Huge to say the least. Was there for rugged maniac event. They could have done a better job at directing traffic and signs to right area as we were all turned around as there is so many enterances. But I don't feel this is the fairgrounds fault so this received a five star as a very nice area with a lot of perks and events<//Review>

Nice place to stay with a trailer or RV. Must be self contained. Showers and laundry room are clean. Near to downtown and the Ace train. You can only smoke or walk your pet outside the gate. Heavy rain tends to flood sections of the RV park.< /text>

<Text>SAVE YOUR PARKING LOCATION. Lovely place but getting back to your car could easily turn into a 1 hour game of 'Find your Car'. We went there, late in October - early afternoon, leaving our Jackets in the car and tried to return back around 7, with the temperature dropping and the wind picking up speed. We ended up searching for our car for almost 50 mins with the cold wind blowing and finally decided to book an uber. By some twisted stroke of luck, we found our car just before booking a cab. Their parking can be a maze sometimes</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The Alameda fair is a staple of my summers, from the pig races, to the hypnotist, to all the concerts they have. It is a great place to bring the family and have a great time. Highly recommended for anyone in the area!</Text>

Great spot for shows, fairs, gun shows, camping, fishing and other odd things. Very nice home and garden events. Huge parking lots. Very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of vendors for sale items and information.The fair is held here every year. Alameda county fair right in Pleasanton, ca.< /text>

Who wouldn't want to pay money to buy a ticket, then pay money to park your car just to get the privilege to stand in the hot sun, pay for way overpriced carnival food/drink, pay outrageous prices for every game, and walk long distances. What a deal. While you're at it, please write me a prescription for Stupid Pills. In summary... Trash!</text>

I had never played both at the same time so it was a bit confusing at first and some workers stayed close by to help us which was great! The only downside was that we couldn't hear one of the callers well and another caller was calling the numbers to fast which caused some patrons to tell out "slow down"!<//Text><Response>None<//Response><Time>1521951396579< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>We were here for the Highland Games last month, and they moved the camping location this year. The old area was grass and dirt, but this was primarily gopher holes and dirt. It was a sea of craters. The gophers were active as well; our group members saw multiple adding to the holes. It's camping, we get it. And we're used to rough sleeping spots. But when it's a major trip hazard, especially when people have to walk to Port a Potties in the dark, it's a problem. For a fairgrounds, this is unreasonable.

If this is where people are going to be camping for the oldest Games in the country, do appropriate maintenance. Grade, dig, scrape, do abatement, whatever it takes to make it a just little safer, because nothing is as nerve-wracking as watching musicians carry expensive drums and bagpipes across the field to the road without rolling an ankle or dropping instruments.

In addition, the fairgrounds staff didn't communicate policy well to the Games' camping officials, so there was some confusion on policy as well.

The only redeeming factor is the availability of showers on site (in the fair itself). It's a bit of a walk, but it's a definite plus. I don't know if that's enough to bring me back, though.<//text>< Pics>

Entry ways are ridiculous and god doesn't help. I suppose if you are from the town you have no problem but seeing as how most people come here for events from out of town they might want to rethink entry gates and drives. Bathrooms are nice some even have showers.< /text>

It is also a very popular place for people to park their cars and commute to their place of work. There is also a train station across the road that many commuters use to catch the train to work. All in all so many things to do here. Take a look around and plan your day..< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Great fair with lots to do. Larger than your average city fair because of the horse races, exhibits and food trucks. Probably the largest I've seen in California but I don't usually go to fairs anyway so take that with a grain of salt. Parking is easy and accessible but also close to the fair so you don't have to walk more than 5-10 minutes.< /text><UserId.>112622495437916594053</UserId.><response>None< /response>< pictures>

<Text>Many things to do here. It's not just the fairgrounds... Many attractions including many Goodguys car shows.

It is also a very popular place for people to park their cars and commute to their place of work. There is also a train station across the road that many commuters use to catch the train to work. All in all so many things to do here. Take a look around and plan your day..</Text>< Pictures>

We go every year & it's always a great time. It's a great Family Day & there's something for everyone. The biggest negative is the food. The prices are too high & continue to rise every year. We've decided to eat a good meal before we go, that way we can get a few snacks while we're there, without breaking the bank (too much). This year especially, we noticed many of the food vendors are serving pretty much the same thing! It's all the same year in, year out without much variety or change. 😕 But overall, we LOVE the fair & look forward to next year!<//review>

Attended the Alameda County Fair this year for the first time, and it was a blast. Tons of fair food, monster trucks, food, lots of art from kids, food, a petting zoo where you feed the animals, then go eat more food. I arrived later than I'd wanted to, but I still got a great parking spot. I'm going back next year for sure! Probably twice!<//review>

After leaving the fair last night we go to the car, and found out that my lady had lost her car keys.  We had to walk all the way back to the concert area, and it was already closed. three male, and two female park officers tried everything that they could to help us. the even had a guy open the gate for us and we all looked around the area, but no keys to be found. We did not know what we were going to do. My lady lives in Oakland and I live in Antioch - Remember - She didn't have her house keys - Then to top things off we got lost trying to find the right gate. we followed every line in the park except the right one. It was 2am by the time that we got to the right gate. Just before we got to the gate, the man would opened the gate for us came up to us and called his office to checkout if they found the key, he also went beyond the call of duty. Well nothing happened so we get to the gate and this security guard by the name of Steve asked us if we had lost some VW keys - our jaws hit the ground -   I asked Steve if they could bring the keys to us, since we were dead tired. 5 minutes later we had the keys in our hands - We want to thank everybody that assisted us - You guys were truly a blessing - But Steve the Security Guard at the end of the green line - We love you - You came to us and asked - We probably would have walked right by you. You saved us so much money and time - HAPPY FATHERS DAY EVERYONE - I will never forget these fine young people - 1LOVE2ALL</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Since 1990, I have been going every year and each year recently I have been making multiple visits to this fair.  It is among the best county fairs in the country.  It is even better than the state fair in many respects.  Their entertainment is really great and they have a cafe next to the red gate that serves great meals for breakfast and lunch which is open all year around for the workers at the fairgrounds and the general public.  Traffic I know can be a problem but if you get there early and catch a meal at the Stable Cafe you will avoid that problem.  The pavilions are great too.  They have great displays of hobbies and a great garden with an indoor waterfall and wishing well.  I encourage my friends who have not been to this fair to go and enjoy themselves.  I do not do horse racing and rarely ride the rides but I like the adult entertainment that is so great.  The fair has something for everybody.  They have special days to celebrate a specific culture and one year they broke the world record of the largest hamburger that I had the opportunity to have many sample from.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Very basic -- with hookups, a laundry, and propane offered for sale at almost double the going rate.  What it has going for it is location.  One of the only places to stay in an RV with hookups in.the East Bay.  RVs are packed in like sardines on.gravel, no picnic tables or even space to set up a grill, table and chairs; unless you like picnicking on top of your neighbors sewer dump.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /gmap_id></record>

<text>We were there for an extended period of time and the extremely small spaces got to us.  The bathrooms are typically clean, though often the showers are a bit disgusting. Staff is pleasant to deal with. The person that drives around at 8pm with his light flashing is unnecessary and annoying. Not bring able to have a fire is horrible, when you are used to having one everywhere else you go. All in all, it's a fine place, if you only need to stay a few days, though would NOT recommend for anything more than that.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The lines werent that bad like longest wait time was 30 minutes rest were between 10 to 20 minutes. There was a kid area, it was fun. The employees didn't really care, or handle certain situations well sucj as rodes being over booked just kicked people off. There was plenty of food, and a whole area for kids, definitly Kid friendly.<//Review>

Your basic county fairgrounds. Decent parking, and multiple gates, though better traffic management would make it excellent. Large areas with decent functional buildings.<//Review>

I love this place altho very disappointed when walking in I bought a cup of corn at the stand selling fruits n drinks tacos I told an employee that they neeed to wipe the junk of hot sauce bottle n he ignored me. That's unsanitary.</Review>

All sorts of events held at fairgrounds from concerts to carshows. Almost impossible to pick one event to describe what happens here.  Events vary on time of year and personal interests.
Good for antique shopping, scion shows guns, quilt shows , horse racing, picnics , Scottish highland games, music, you get the idea.
Check the website. You should find something you like and is of interest to you.</Text>

Tickets are pretty expensive for the rides most rides cost about $5. I recommend taking out some cash you are willing to spend and only spending that amount. This way you can get some festival food,  then spend more time focusing on the cool free stuff. I recommend all of the animal exhibits especially the racing pigs (I've seen this show three times, love it everytime.)</text>

Handy access to many local attractions and everything worked. The bathroom and laundry areas are clean. The employees were friendly and pleasant. The spaces are small and packed in tight. Most sites have bare ground and sparce gravel, but some have grass. A nice stop along the way.<//text>

<text>Great fair. Entry price is good but if you have kids and want to do the carnival part be prepared to pay! Wrist bands are the way to go for the older kids. There are height requirements so for the little ones it might be better to get tickets rather then the wrist bands<//text></record>

Being going to this fair for over 25 years. The entertainment has always been good and its a safe, friendly environment to take your family. But! Since the Fair had changed ownership alot of good things about the fair is no longer good. The price of admission is outrageous. 15.00, for adults, 10.00 child. Your an adult at the age 11. These are Disneyland prices. The entertainment is no longer free. To see live entertainment will cost you, 22.99- 44.99 a seat. Prices of food always have high, so pack a lunch< /Text>

< Review>
RV Park staff were terrible during the four months we endured this HeII hole. Campers are packed in like sardines - except for the camp hosts who were provided the only spaces with room on either side. The person calling himself manager (later found out he's not actually a manager) is a young man named Anthony Wiener. He was the absolute worst. My advice to anyone considering parking their RV there is to avoid this place like the plague. The two parks there are horrid but are very popular with the local illegal alien community.</Review>

This place was fun but the food was not good at all and usually i like fair food, my family and i tried quite a variety and we didnt like anything but some of the chinese food and the hot dog bites,believe it or not but the corn dogs SUCKED! They weren't crunchy they were old 😳 Lol just being honest i would say the fair games were ok though and we had fun overall. But it wasnt worth it! I've been to smaller ones and loved it and the food but one thing i will applaud this place for is the lines, they were great on keeping their lines short or none at all wich was fantastic! And a great variety of fun rides u dont see at other fairs.<//text>

<review>The Alameda County Fairgrounds is a great venue for so many different events every year. Certainly the key event of every year is the Alameda County Fair. What is really nice about this facility is it is made up of so many different sub sections and buildings, you never get bored at any event. However, sometimes people tend to get lost because there are so many.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /gmapID></record>

Lots of events year round! Traffic is most of the time well managed but still can be very bothersome. Beware: everything food related inside is overpriced and not good at all. Ice beverages can cost $5! Corn dogs can cost just under $10! Just add 50% to everything usually priced and you have the Fair pricing!<//text>

<Text>The AMAZING amount of price gouging that goes on here is breathtaking. I simply can't abide paying an entrance fee, paying for parking and then paying for virtually everything inside. The only thing that's missing is a permission to leave charge.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /Gmap_id><resp>None</resp></record>

Going here for just a relaxing summer time with your family is a beautiful thought at first. When you enter, there are entrance, parking, rides, food and a whole lot of spent money. Be sure to bring lots of cash because you are going to spend money like it is flying out of your hands!</Review>

It may be hot to go in the summer but its worth it to go with your friends, families or maybe go out with you counterpart. It is also expensive which is best to save up money if you would like to buy a wristband to have access to all rides (than to go back for more tickets because it's time consuming) and try something you would never try?! Like gelato, beignets, deep fried cookie dough, (idk why but) deep fried BUTTER!?? (WHAAA) or whatever you are familiar with.</text>

Beware: everything food related inside is overpriced and not good at all. Ice beverages can cost $5! Corn dogs can cost just under $10! Just add 50% to everything usually priced and you have the Fair pricing!</Text>< Pictures>

A good place to store your rv or boat.  Cheapest place in the bay area plus free dumping.  There is also a small store for parts and repair.  Propane is also available at cheaper that the other local places.</Review>

I feel that monitoring Carnival Pass isn't accurate by Butler Amusements. It does not let you know what was used for the amount of rides left.  Some operators that scan the card is not knowledgable on how to use the handheld scanner.  Sad to say the last ride my granddaughter 6(yrs) lined up for, was sent away because of lack of ticket fund. Not so happy with this new system!</Text>

<date>1531370335312</date><rating>5</rating><Text>New well update version of the classic fair. All games and rides use a single pay card. No more paying cash for games. Every person in Pleasanton visits the fair, in most cases every year. Very large area. They have everything, Kid rides, large rides, shopping, music, races, food and art galleries. Must go for everyone living in the tri-valley and beyond. Can be very expensive but worth it. Opens with a cattle eide through downtown also a good sight. Also visit the art gallery, some very talented artists.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
My first county fair experience did not disappoint! Parking and driving in and out of the fair was painless, and you can pay $20 for VIP parking which gets you right at one of the entrances -- worth it if you arrive when it's 95 degrees out! I enjoyed all of the different attractions, from the model train exhibit, stages of live music (there was even a hypnotist!), to demolition derby and motocross, agriculture and shopping arcade, and of course the rides! The $5 skyride includes unlimited rides, but if you're afraid of heights I'd skip it! I'd do the $35 ride pass if I were there all day -- lots of great rides for all ages! The food was not as crazy or outrageously good as I thought it'd be, but I had some good eats, such as the strawberry short cake, fried Twinkies, peach lemonade, corn dogs, and fresh grilled corn on the cob. Make sure to bring plenty of cash! I'll come back next year and stick around for the concert and fireworks at night!<//Review>

The line to get into the fair is poorly managed (like TSA without the thrill of flying). When you get in the fairgrounds though, it is great. Beautiful grounds, fun games and attractions, with some interesting finds in the Shopping area.< /text>

Pro: nearby parking, variety of things to see like rides, barn animals, magic shows, arts and crafts, carnival food.
Con: food overpriced but normal for any fair, must pay to park, very hot with little shade in food areas so need to go see barn animals or art indoors to cool off.< /review>

Went to the County Fair in July. Go early to get parking closer to the entrance of the fair. Buildings are older and bathrooms need renovation, but it's a huge place and really enjoyed the outdoor seating under the trees.<//Review>

Don't waste your time and money here. I was looking forward to a good day until some carny forced my girlfriend into game of darts. He threw the darts himself, charged us $30 for the toy we 'won', and threatened to call security if we didn't pay. Absolutely disgusting. This place deserves no support.

The people are also a little racist (based on personal experience), so if you're not white, beware...</Text>

Parking away from the area was $15 and at the fair itself was $20. Entry fees vary by event, but the 4th of July fair was around $12 a person. Lots to do and see. Bring water, food, spray bottles and sun screen. Metal Detectors and screening for sealed containers like coke cans not allowed.<//Review>

<text>Quite pricey at 15 for adults 10 for kids. It's also gets super hot at this time of the year, over 100 easily but guess it's not their fault. There's a couple exhibits you can go indoors with ac to escape the heat.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We went last Tuesday and the admission for everyone was only $2.00.  However, I guess they compensated for the low admission by skimping on the janitorial service as we have never seen such VILE women's restrooms in our lives!  We tried three different ones and they were all equally horrible.  Most of the bathrooms had no toilet paper, paper seat liners, and the paper towel dispensers (every one1) were jammed and wouldn't work.  The paper on the floors was literally up to our ankles!

Beware and bring your own supplies if you plan to go!</Text>

The county Fair is pretty standard, but the food was not that great. I always see on TV other fairs around the country and their food looks amazing, but the food here was mediocre. We had the corndogs (the hot dog was gross, but the batter was so good and crispy), horchata smoothie (had a weird after taste) latte freeze (tasted like powdered coffee), nachos (these were good cause we like liquid cheese, but they gave us a lot of small broken chips, which we couldn't even eat cause it kept falling apart), and bacon wrapped pork belly (I heard it was alright from my boyfriend, I was not about to eat that). The petting farm animal area was chaotic because of the children, but the animals were super cute, and that was the best part of the fair. It's a nice fair to walk around and hang out with friends, but don't expect much from the food.<//Text>

Love this fair. It has musical entertainment, slideshows, art exhibits, farm animal auctions and viewings of 4H projects, hobby, landscape, flower, art, and sewing displays and competitions, hawker things to buy such as jewelry, carnival rides, and fair foods such as corn dogs, gyros, ice cream, candy apples, funnel cakes.<//Text>

The Alameda County Fair draws residents from across the Bay Area. There is plenty of lawn space, lots of indoor spaces for hot days, and a variety of foods for the whole family.<//review>

Extremely hard to find parking. Fun establishment for many events. But crowded. And you get a lot of rowdy people that drink a bit too much and sort of spoil the fun for everyone.< /text>

<Review>Quite pricey at 15 for adults 10 for kids. It's also gets super hot at this time of the year, over 100 easily but guess it's not their fault. There's a couple exhibits you can go indoors with ac to escape the heat.< /Review></record>

<Text>I usually go to the golf course inside the race track. 3 stars because it is a small course well maintained where you can use driver for sure on 2 and perhaps 3 if you can control it to about 170 yds. Fantastic place to practice your irons and putts. Very well maintained. There is a driving range in the same area near the golf course where you can use driver from grass as on a tee box. Limit 270yds. If you can hit more than 270yds, there are mats too.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Unfortunately whenever I visit here, it's for the Alameda county fair and its blistering hot. I need relief from the sun, and there is a large seating area in the middle of what appears to be a food court, under several big trees. Lots of vendors there with refreshments and food. There is handicap parking with parking attendants.</review>< Pictures>

I usually go to the golf course inside the race track. 3 stars because it is a small course well maintained where you can use driver for sure on 2 and perhaps 3 if you can control it to about 170 yds. Fantastic place to practice your irons and putts. Very well maintained. There is a driving range in the same area near the golf course where you can use driver from grass as on a tee box. Limit 270yds. If you can hit more than 270yds, there are mats too.</review>

<text>Overpriced parking ($15-20), overpriced rides ($3-$10 per person!), overpriced tickets ($10-15), overpriced bad food ($4 water, etc.), and most of the staff were rude. Is it because I'm not from around here? Do locals find these prices outrageous?

The only thing that saved it from two stars was that the people from the customer service trailer were nice, and also how big and diverse the fairgrounds are (animals were cute, cool horseracing, and I was blown away by the fact tgat you could buy a peacock). Not a good place to take a family. Will never come again.<//text>< pictures>

I have been attending the Big O tire concert events for the past five years and enjoyed each concert attended. I like the fact that tickets can be purchased in advance this year.< /Text>

Cost to park is high.  Several trees broke off limbs the day I was there.  VERY DANGEROUS. It was very windy but lack of maintenance can lead to serious injury.  The landscape probably never gets watered properly so dry branches are ready to drop.< /Text>

<text>The fair was a tradition for us for the 4th of July. No fireworks because of a litle fight last year? Sad. Full price on fourth of July even though it closes 5 hrs earlier? What a rip! Also, sooo many rules added. Too much $ for what is basically just another carnival now that should be held in a store parking lot. Last year they had less vendors than the year before. This year seemed to be even less. Talked to some of them and they all tend to agree this may be their last year at this fair. Bummed out by rules and over pricing.  Better luck next year? I can imagine if this keeps up they will lose a substantial ammount of patrons through the next couple of years.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Great place to have an event or to attend an event the grounds are huge and the facilities are able to accommodate almost any event. it can be a bit intimidating to drive around and get out but you will eventually get there, or out.< /Text>

<review>Senior day! Get in free if over 62! Rides, drinks, and food you never dreamed of. Kinda expensive, $4 sodas, $13 BBQ turkey legs, $13 Jack Daniel slush drinks. Want to add fries and soda to your burger? Just add $7 makes it a combo, really? Go broke eating, not me! Shopping galore, beds, hot tubs, clothes, bird feeders, new collar for your pets and more. Free shows thru out the day; magic, music, motor cross to name a few. Free nightly concerts with fair addmission. Great way to spend a hot afternoon. 😂<//review><Gmap_id>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /Gmap_id>< rate>

<text>I for one didn't like the fair. It is crowded, parking is hard and food is just bad. I don't mind paying high price but food has to be good. It seems same vendors yr after yr.

<Review>Stayed at Fairgrounds RVPark one night. Curteous volunteer host and camp attendant Didn't have a reservation but they were able to accomodate drop ins easily. Only hassle was my fault for not having a reservation, Camp host was on duty, attendant was out to lunch and she couldn't check in people unless they had a reservation. Clean, quiet, easy access, wide back in spot, real good internet, ez use full hookups. There's even a RV store in the campground with the best Propane prices in the area. $3.59 + 10% discount for over 10 gals, & gave me another 10% for paying cash! I'll definitely stay here again when in the area.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Rides took a lot of tickets, and 80 tickets were used in less than two hours so I wandered around for another two hours. That is why it goes down a star. Rides were good though.

I’m a animal lover, and hate to see animals being hurt and abused. I visited the rabbitry or the P building with the small animals and I was disgusted to see the rabbits in small cages with wore bottoms. Adding on to my bad experience, this little girl took out a Dwarf Hotot bunny (it’s dwarf bunny with “eyeliner” around its eyes) and she handled it so roughly, pulling and grabbing on its ears. I told her she was holding the rabbit incorrectly because the rabbit was in obvious pain. However the volunteers and her said it was correct, which surprised me. I want to know who trains these volunteers, because handling bunnies that way is incorrect and it hurts them. To make up trying to correct their handling, I tried starting a conversation with the girl. Turns out, she was extremely rude. I asked for her name because I was going to tell my friend who was with me that she kind of looks like another friend, but she smiled and said, “Why should I tell you?” At that point, I was baffled that this girl was allowed to sit here and give misinformation. Then, another volunteer brought another bunny, (a young Flemish Giant) it was really sweet, but when it got curious and sniffed the Dwarf Hotot, the girl pulled on her ears with noticeable force. I was pained just to watch this hidden abuse happen while other tourists just watched. Turns out, she doesn’t even volunteer there but is able to take out, hold, and carry the bunnies, just because her sister volunteers there. She said that “Oh I’m not a volunteer here but my sister volunteers here.”But for some reason the other tourists (including me) WASN’T allowed to hold them. I held the Dwarf Hotot, because I wanted the other tourists to see this is how you are supposed to hold a bunny for a few seconds, and the bunny was annoyed from being held, not scared and in pain like how the other volunteers and the girl hold them. Technically, that girl was also a tourist, because she didn’t volunteer here but was allowed to do what volunteers do with the bunnies. She tried to quote “check the gender again” of the poor little Dwarf Hotot. She flipped her on her back and that made the rabbit go into “tonic immobility” which means the bunny was too scared to move. Now, when you are sexing a bunny, you need to press gently around he genitals. This girl was pushing down. Again, I was baffled by how these volunteers and this girl was trained. I was also surprised by the girl’s rude behavior. I read on the “Code of Conduct” on the Alameda County Fair’s website page:

“Generally respectful behavior is expected from all attendees. Littering, spitting, sitting/propping feet on table tops, abusing landscaping, property, etc. will not be tolerated.”

This girl was being rude to me and my friend, and she was abusing the bunnies( who fall into the exhibits category)

It laters claims “Violation of these Rules of Conduct will constitute cause for removal of the violator from the Fair grounds.”

This girl should have been escorted from the fair, because she wasn’t even a volunteer there and handling the bunnies as if she was, abused the bunnies, and was extremely rude to my friend and I.

The other volunteers carried the bunnies properly, and NEVER kept same-sex pairs of unspayed bunnies on the same table. When they carried them, they picked up the rabbits chest and torso area and scooped up their bottom, which is good because it provokes he bunny from jumping around.

Overall I made this two stars because the bunnies were being abused, the girl was rude and was supposed to be kicked off, and the volunteers broke the Code of Conduct when they let the girl handle the bunnies when she wasn’t even a volunteer there. I have been studying bunnies and researching for more than two years, so I think I would know how to treat a rabbit correctly, making it happy and healthy.

If you ever see a rabbit being abused there, speak up.< /review>

Alameda County Fairgrounds has 2 RV lots the South lot and the North Lot.  We pulled in later in the evening and were put in the South lot.  So we paid for 2 nights.  Went to the camp host the following day to pay for a week. We asked to move spots up from 1 spot in the South lot to another spot in the South lot.  She said it was available. So we paid and got our paper work.   We then get a phone call from Joyce (the lady that makes the decisions) that we cannot be in the South lot we have to move to the North lot.  The south lot is for Horseman. We go talk to the Camp host, she is unaware of Joyce moving construction people out of the South lot but whatever Joyce says go cause she makes the decisions.  So we go look at the spots available in the North lot (which are more expensive) they are all small and very close. There is no room between your neighbor and your self.  So we found a couple ends spots and some with grass. But No we couldn't have those cause they are not available for long term stay. But there is no long-term stay here, cause you have to move your trailer every 30 days due to some kind of California law.  We have been all over California for the past year, this is the only park that has makes you move every 30 days.  Apparently Joyce does not live in the trailer and know how much time and work it takes to move from 1 spot to another.  The people who work and live here are so nice!  I just wish the park were ran better so you could get the same answers from the people who work here.  There are no other parks in the area unfortunately.< /text>

Very very bad organization!!!.
They take advantage of disable people!!!....they have only few "handi ap" parking slot...that of course they are taken very fast.....but...they now have " premier spots"...@ $ 5.00 more....thieves!!!
If someone has trouble walking....will have no choice...but pay $ 5.00 more.
.....crooks !!<//review>

<Text>Why are there no water park areas? Just a small run through the sprinklers section??? Every hear it gets ridiculously hot and they charge $4 for bottle water! There should be water bottle refill areas!

Yes there are a few water fountains but in comparison to the size of the fair and the fact that it's a county fair, the main focus shouldn't always be money.

And can we get some regulation on the amount the wristbands go up every year??? Just 6 years ago it was $25 or $29. Now it's $35.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808fe99c7f712b85:0x23d9ba2916d6e9a9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Review on the RV park. The park is nice, but the people running the RV section are people who do not know what they are doing. The front office has no idea what is going on in the park and if anything goes wrong the front office person blames the camp host. Do not believe anything these people say. There is no long term stay unless you would like to play musical chairs/spots with your RV. Because we travel for work and due to where we were working this was the only place to stay!! Save yourself the headache go somewhere else....The south lot has police in and out of there on a weekly basis due to various crimes according to our camp host but the front office put us there anyway nice!!!! forget about customer service they do not know what this is.........< /Review>

It was hot, (104 F) at 5:pm!!! Few shade available and entrance fees and parking are expensive. You need to pay to take any rides.< /Review>

Apparently it pays to steal at the horse races here. Someone took a 5$ credit voucher that i left in a machine. At the information desk i learned my money was used to place a bet and they were able to track and halt it. The info desk guy told me i had to hope on their bet to win, which it did. However they actually paid the thief the remainder on the profit and only credited back my 5$ to me. I was told if the thiefs bet didnt win then i wouldnt get my money back at all. Pays to steal here i guess. I understand that vouchers need to be treated as cash but maybe management can figure out a way to not reward people who steal from other people at their establishment.<//text>

I was there for the Goodguys Auto Show and there was a lot of room for the cars on display. Just not enough room for the cars to drive around where there aren't pedestrians.< /review>

4th of July was a nightmare! We paid extra for premier parking only to be stuck for over 2 hours trying to exit. Kids were exhausted, baby had no more milk. HORRIBLE set up and no organization for traffic flow! First and Last time I visit this place.<//review>

<Review>7/17/13

After paying the $10 parking fee and walking in the HOT HOT sun for what seemed like an eternity, we came to the blue entrance of the Fair. Preferred parking (which had only been $5 more was pretty open and right near the entrance). Shouldn't have been worried about saving money for food/games - it would have been worth it. Especially since we spent the next 10 standing in line to get in. No shade here either. Security waved his xray wand over me. I asked for a pat-down search but only got a laugh.

We walked in and the first thing I saw was the Black Rock Roller Disco!!! FROM BURNING MAN!!! I started going to BM in 2002 and roller skating on the playa is one of my favorite art installations!

We did a little shopping and as we walked around I was shocked at all the designer-knockoffs we saw. I had literally seen a commercial about not supporting the industry of fake designer brands because it often supports child labor, etc. I passed on all the "Coach" purses but did buy a pair of "Chanel" earrings for $10.90 from Dream Land of West Covina (3458 E. Temple Way, #32). I also bought an anklet for $8.75 from Jewelry Trends, Inc. (Orlando Outlets, 8200 Vineland Ave.). I kid you not, my ankle had a green ring around it by the time we left the Fair a few hours later. I should have known. My favorite purchase was a pair of awesome dress sandals with pretty jewels on top for $27 (from Joann 21 Health Prod, 28370 Championship Drive, Moreno Valley). They're comfy and perfect for work. I actually loaned them to Mom for a cruise she's leaving on this week.

We were very successful at buying food and made sure to buy plenty! We had a hand-dipped corndog that was amazing. Fresh popcorn ($3) that was as good as the popcorn Target sells (which is awesome!) West Coast Concessions sold us a turkey leg ($9.75) and a large soda ($4). The turkey was good but not nearly as good as the one from Willie Birds BBQ we had at the Cajun Festival in Isleton. I carried a reuseable water bottle with me all day and a couple vendors were nice enough to refill my ice/water. Festival volunteers working information booths even gave me a refill once. I ate a pretzel covered in salt and mustard that I bought at the horse track.

We only stayed at the horses for one race (Race #6 of the day). Horse #9 came in last place so my $5 bet didn't work out so well. It's pretty amazing that you can go to the fair and watch horse racing. This place is huge.

All of the rides and midway games were in another area and it was too hot to go on most of them (plus, I hate roller coasters) so we found some shade and more water and headed toward the Safeway Amphitheater. Clay Walker was performing on the fair's final night and he put on a pretty good show. Minus all the brats running to the stage and interrupting the show to ask for his guitar picks.

Totally can't wait for next year's fair. Alameda County has to be the biggest and best County Fair in the State.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Went to the RV show 1/13/09 and paired 10.00 bucks for parking then another 26.00 bucks to go into the RV showrooms. Which were chaotic white circus tents set up with travel trailers and RVs. It felt the weird setup was to trap people from leaving. Forcing people to keep looking at other stuff that wasn't a RV( like massages)?<//Text>

The behavior of your security guards is nauseating, inexcusable, and "disgusting."< /Text>

<text>You'll pay what a twelve pack costs for a single beer. You'll spend twelve dollars for a single alligator kebab. Salespeople will urge you to buy their gimmicky tat. You'll marvel at fifty rough copies of the same art assignment done by fourth graders.

And yet, it could be worse.<//text><response>None</response><user_id>110412972252574376120<//user_id>< user_name>

< Review>
Went to the RV show 1/13/09 and paired 10.00 bucks for parking then another 26.00 bucks to go into the RV showrooms. Which were chaotic white circus tents set up with travel trailers and RVs. It felt the weird setup was to trap people from leaving. Forcing people to keep looking at other stuff that wasn't a RV( like massages)?< /Review>

<review>First time back in many years, we arrived about 1:15 pm Sunday afternoon and noticed many show cars were leaving,  my uncle was with us and Alameda County Fairgrounds offers  NO Senior Citizen discounts.
Food there was a bit high $$$, and having a beer was out of question for me. I'm not cheap, just wise,   i'm enjoying a nice cold beer now at home.</review>< Date>

<Review>Facilities are good. Website has wrong address, as in puts you in a no-outlet residential neighborhood about 3 miles from where you need to be. No staff on-site while we were there.<//Review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) I went to the Norcal night market. The venue was very large but far away from the parking lot. When I came, it was still bright and it didn’t feel like a night market. There were a lot of food stalls but the delicious ones were super crowded. There was no interest in queuing at all. There were some artists. I came over to set up the stall and sold some clothes, ornaments, balloons and other gadgets. Many people took a large bag of dolls they won from playing games. They parked for $10 and tickets were $5. You can experience it.

去參加Norcal night market, 活動場地非常大但是离停車場很遠，來的時候天還很亮沒什麼夜市的感覺，小吃攤挺多的不過好吃的都超多人完全沒有排隊的興趣，有一些藝術家過來擺摊還有賣一些衣服掛飾氣球等小玩意兒的，好多人拿著玩遊戲贏來的一大袋玩偶，停車10刀，門票5刀，可以體驗一下< /Text>
