<Review>Had an authorized empty move from my company. Weekend crew denied me access saying the trailer was scheduled for loading on Monday...didn’t even give him the trailer number..asked for his name, he denied...asked for manager’s name and he denied.....asked security guard at the gate for management name...no habla Ingles!!! This company knows how to stick together... but I’m not stopping until my complaint is heard</Review>< pics>

<text>Not bad my only thing they tell you go out the other way but when I got around there it was close I had to back all the way down it was really tight for me to back into a spot with a 53ft truck and trailer you can barely pull out those spots the spots are for yard dogs and 48ft trucks and trailers but maybe they close that other side down cause it was about 9pm really don't know< /text>< pics>

<review>This place has horrible parking, the drop yard for empties is always a mess and the main yard always has trailers blocking other trailers that make it pretty hard to find your loaded trailer. If I could avoid this place I would. On the good side, the guard and the office staff are usually very pleasant< /review>< pics>

<review>For the love of God please figure out where you want trucks to enter and exit. Every time I pick up or deliver here something has changed and I have to jump through flaming hoops to get out of there. Dropping an empty is always a nightmare because the empty lot is over filled and too small. If you cant find your loaded trailer look behind the random dropped trailers that litter the lot, then just move it yourself. Also when you make the right turn to go up the hill into the loaded lot, be careful. The yard jockeys (or goats(?)) drive around that place like they are paid by the mile and are late getting across the country.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I had a fleeting experience with Performances Team. The interaction was welcoming and warm.  The team showed solidarity, professionalism and were committed to growth. I greatly enjoyed my time.

<review>Wow after reading reviews sad to say nothing has changed.  I worked at Performance team over 10 years ago.  I had to stay with the agency for 2 years before the company decided to hire on. My first raise was a quarter.  Sad how they treated undocumented workers, considering thats was most the company.  They hired  but never raised there pay.  Sadly my raise was a quarter.  Luckly they hired a new supervisor who gave me a hard time, which I decided to quit, and found a good paying job same type of work only paid about $3 and hour more to start.  Sad to see this company hasnt changed.</review>< date>

Where to start if you're bringing in an empty trailer when you make the right on shoemaker you need to take the first right which is performance teams drop yard, don't bring it to the warehouse they will tell you to turn around and take it to the drop yard.

I also find it interesting that at the drop yard they ask you for your license you're dropping a trailer !!! Then when you come to the warehouse they ask you at the gate for your license when you go in to pick up your bills they ask you at the window for your license and after you pick up your trailer to exit they ask you again for your drivers license that's four times what do you need all this information for and what do you do with it after you collect it I think it's a little ridiculous...... Make sure you have all your information you need prior to coming to performance teams warehouse,,,, I find that the people that work here don't really care to help anybody and trying to get information is like pulling teeth but probably pulling teeth is less painful than dealing with these people good luck and happy travels !!!!< /Text>

Yard was way too tight. Trailers were left every which way, some blocking the others. While trying to get my trailer out which was not possible my truck got stock. To move the trailer that blocked me bald yard jockey named Frank told me that he could help me but he charges for that. I saw other drivers paying him to get their trailers out. I refused to pay, complained to PT and my own company after hour and a half they sent a better yard jockey to help me. I have been all over the country trucking, this was the worst experience I had and by far the worst yard.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Fix was absolutely stellar throughout the process. They worked with insurance and even fielded my, arguably, too frequent and frantic calls! I appreciate how professional, courteous, and timely the entire staff was. They took what was a stressful experience and made me feel confident that it was all in good hands. Thank you Fix team!</Review>< Name>

I was recommended by several other people who came here to have their car serviced after an accident and they did not disappoint! They completed my repairs faster than expected and kept me informed the entire time about what was going on and answered every question I had. They are not partnered with Progressive, but were more than happy to service my vehicle. I had several problems with misinformation with Progressive that the auto shop had to unfortunately deal with as well which they handled so well and cannot thank them enough for putting up with them as well. 10/10 and will continue to recommend them.<//review>

Staff was friendly and communicated with me at every step of the repair process.</text>< Pics>

<text>Firstly, I want to give kudos to Thelma.  She immediately made me feel that, she, and her team was going to take good care of my car.  LOL, when I saw a call from Fix, I was nervous about what I’d learn.  I told Thelma I was dreading what she would say.  But, she was so excited to tell me that the repair was as estimated.  Whew, I was so relieved.

So, we got our car three days before what was estimated.  Right on.  Thelma was there when we picked the car and did a great job getting us checked out.  If I needs any body work on my car Fix is the first choice.  Thank you Thelma</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Great service! They did a great job restoring my car to a better than brand new car after it was stolen and recovered! Stephanie and Brandon were both amazing and did a fantastic job communicating with my insurance company and delivering a better than new car to me. I couldn't be happier and I highly recommend Fix Auto. Thank you!!!< /Text>

Fix Auto in North Anaheim gave the true definition of customer care to its fullest meaning. The first nice experience was noticing how brand new the building looked from pulling up to it. There’s plenty of parking available on the street & also on the side street adjoining the main building. Right when you walk into the lobby you’re greeted by a very professional lady. You’re offered coffee or water while all your information is checked in. The front customer care representative even called the car rental for you in case a car rental is needed while your car is being serviced for repairs. My vehicle was at Fix Auto for five working days. I was notified via phone text the progress during my cars stay there. I highly recommend Fix Auto North. Ask for Marvin Hernandez. Marvin was the most knowledgeable person helping me while my vehicle was being repaired on. Marvin fully explained to me what the whole process would entail & told me If I had any concerns please feel free to call him. Fix Auto has made this experience 110% to my satisfaction for anymore automobile auto body repair I may have in the future. Huge kudos to Fix Auto North & their entire staff for a wonderful experience!!!< /review>

I worked with Stephanie when my car was rear ended when it was parked on Anaheim Blvd. I chose them because they were close but I would use them again if the needed.  She was very professional and helpful in getting my car towed and taking care of all arrangements. She kept me informed every step of the way. In a stressful time it was reassuring to work with Stephanie.<//text>

We brought our CR-V to Fix Auto after a too-close encounter with a stone light pole footing left the bumper hanging off and damage to the front left fender and wheel well. FA was among a list of 4 recommendations from our insurance company. I've never been to a cleaner, nicer body shop. We got an inspection  appointment the same day we called. They made an initial inspection of our CR-V and told us they'd be in touch with  an estimate. They followed through and stayed in touch throughout the process and finished a day sooner than the estimate stated. They washed and waxed the car and it looks great. My wife is very happy to have it back! Thanks, Fix Auto, for being friendly, fast, and professional!</text>

<Review>TOP NOTCH! Excellent service!  So impressed with this Fix Auto location. i was having such a rough week and you all made it the process so easy. Wonderful experience, great repair quality and the customer service is just great! Turn-around- time was faster than expected. I will recommend this place to family and friends.

Thank you Stephanie for the excellent communication. And thank you David Caulfield for taking the time to meet me as a new customer.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Nice clean front and shop (unexpected of an auto body shop)
Long wait tho.
Went there to get stuff from our car that was totalled. Courteous front lady. But Had to wait really long(probably 45 min or so) before the agent came out and took us to our car.

Do not know how good of an auto body work they do tho as we just went to clean out out totalled car< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcd62320c2bca1:0xf4f52ea23809271f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Stephanie was helpful as well as professional and she kept me up on all details of my car getting repaired. Originally I was to receive my car on the 26th of February but the front bumper did not fit correctly so I was given a factory bumper which was an upgrade from the bumper I had previously. This bumper has the black grill like the brand new cars. I was very satisfied with their service and would recommend this 5 star facility.< /text>

Very satisfied. Clean, friendly and very different than other body shops I have seen. I recommend Fix Auto Anaheim North for sure. I didn't know I had the right to go to any shop I wanted to, in contrast to my insurance company. When I learned that, I dropped off the car and Fix Auto Anaheim North handled everything.< /text>

I had my car repaired at FX auto for the first time . The process was so smooth . The whole team was super nice and professional.  Amanda and Stephanie were the ones who helped me through the whole process. They were very professional /courteous and were able to answer all of my questions and concerns ! They went above and beyond to get me to the car rental company in these difficult (covid 19 ) times. As I picked up my car , they did a great job replacing the parts and made it look new again ! I reallly appreciated all of their hard work and dedication to make sure I left happy ! I would definitely recommend this shop I'f you need an auto shop to fix your car! Would definitely go there again! Thanks again Stephanie!</review>

This shop is amazing! I've never seen such a clean facility and the Plant Manager was a pleasure to work with. Car looks great, and very fast service. Customer Care was very friendly. I hope you never need a collision repair but if you do, you need to come here, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

<review>Fix auto was amazing I hit a cirb while out of state and was afraid I would not be able to make the drive home over 1000 miles in time. There team was really friendly and took care of my family the repair were rushed and finished in just 24 hours. they worked with my insurance and delt with the whole situation. I was in town for a funeral and they really stepped up for me on all levels. making my car safe for an on time drive back from a not so pleasant situation.Thank you Fix Auto!  Brandon and the rest of the team there are amazing .<//review><userid>106402493259336114114</userid>< date>

<Review>This place is convenient if your in a hurry, they have the basic foods. They dont have anything only food.They don't have chips either I thought I would add that since sometimes I get off just to buy chips this store doesn't have that however on a positive note they accept Google pay or Apple pay. They have pan dulce and they also have a small restaurant where you can order rotisserie chicken, burrito,tortas and other goodies. Products are a little pricier here but thats what you expect from a mom and pop shop. But sometimes id rather pay a little more than go to a crowded store<//Review>< pictures>

What a wonderful surprise to find this gem of a place. I was tasked to bring some meats to bbq and found La Pradera Carniceria. LPC not only offers the varieties of marinated meats but at the excellent price. I got their marinated flap meat and chicken, 3 lbs each. I also picked up red and green salsa along with guacamole. I also happy to pick up this brand of street taco style tortillas that I didn't see in usual supermarkets. Both meats were easy to cook and came out perfectly off the grill. I simply diced up the meat nicely and spread them with condiments for the DIY street taco.< /review>

I have been trying all different carniceria in LA and Orange County. To prove that there is a better Carniceria than La Pradera. But I have yet to find a better place. If you don't see something that you want all you have to do is ask for it and they will defer it for you. I promise this is the BEST CARNE ASADA you will ever have. It is a must!
Oh and yes they sell Carne Asada so I'm not sure what that person means when they don't sell it. Completely false
Anyway this place is the best hands down 😄< /review>

I do come here often foods great but unfourtanetly, customer service is not so. The ladies that work there always talking about the customers just because they chichatting in spanish they think we can hear or understand. Thats really uncomfortable. Aswell also so unfriendly welcoming. Really sad. That should change!<//text>

Very good, super friendly staff. Cup Cakes are super light & fluffy they melt when it hits your tongue.  There are so many flavors it's hard not to over buy. I bought 12....couldn't choose a flavor.  They have a fun lounge area to hang out and relax.</text>

Went today for a girls date. No one else was seated so quite a nice experience.  They have couch seating and table seating.
All of the deserts are on the small side, but that's a good thing. Perfect size for a party. Quite a few different cupcakes and cheesecakes. Something for everyone. Check them out.<//Text>

I love the cupcakes at this place. They have so many flavors cupcakes and brownies, and all taste really good. They have just the right amount of sweet. Normally, I couldn't finish 1 cupcake, but tonight I had 2 and wanted more. Check out Sweet Embellishments.  You will not be disappointed.</text>

This place is awesome. The service is fast and the cupcakes are a great price. Additionally, the cupcakes taste homemade, they are moist and look great. I would recommend this place for everyone. Best buy and best prices around.< /Review>

<Review>happy 10th anniversary Sweet embellishments. You guys have done a lot for me and my wife. We actually happened to have your cupcakes hosted at our wedding a couple years back and while it was awesome, the cupcakes were probably one of the most memorable things about it.. I highly suggest these they are out of the world. In bulk there a great bargain and I would highly recommend them as aparty favor or something to bring at a potluck. You wouldn't be disappointed and that people that try them with the assortment of flavors would really just be blown away. Can't thank you guys again enough.<//Review>< pictures>

Better call ahead, they took awhile to assemble the cupcakes. (At least 15 mins to do 8 cupcakes) Don't get me wrong. Their cupcakes are good, and not too sweet.</review>

When I went in, the place was kinda dimly  and kinda silent when entering.

They have small cupcakes as examples but entire display case that was empty so I wasn't sure if I had to order earlier. Apparently all their stock is in the back.

Despite all this. Their cupcakes  are really good. The service was quick and the price was cheap.

I love cupcake shops and while this place was a little more lax rather than the more pop-y vibe you get from other cupcake places, the taste of the cupcakes more than made up for it.<//review>

Good prices, tasty cupcakes.  They also have mini brownies and mini cheesecakes.  You can walk in off the street for most cupcakes anytime for cheesecakes you'll have to order ahead of time.<//Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I was so disappointed. The 'cream' that they use to top their cupcakes is bland as are their cakes. I had the green tea and the red velvet and they taste exactly the same. The cream is so oily that after I finished eating it there was an odd film on the inside of my mouth.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd31e5f3978fa3:0xf001054b42c2bb87</Gmap_id><rating>2</rating><date>1466188476865<//date>< username>

From the moment  you arrive in that place  they give you a nice feeling. Very courteous hosts, it is a kind place to go out with buddies or with your date. Great  cuisine, creative  chef de cuisine, reasonable  cost and attentive  service. Highly recommended.</text>

<text>When I ordered, I read it to the guy and repeated it to make sure he heard it right. Well got it home and I specifically said no beans... There was beans, also said no rice in the Amigo Burrito, there was rice. The food was not hot and the chips we're stale. The Albondigus soup was blane. Don't know what's happened there. But really dissatisfied.< /text>< pics>

I love this place. The food is fresh and healthy. The street tacos are tasty, and their meatball soup makes a great lunch for work the next day. The people are friendly and helpful, something I really appreciate because I have food allergies.< /review>

< Review>
My wife and I travel for work. We have been enjoying Taco Tuesday ‘s for awhile now. If you’re traveling anywhere close to the high desert then take a short trip along old Route 66. Stop in Helendale for the best carnitas tacos that I have ever had. Everything we have ordered for the 4 short months was exceptional. The service was awesome. I will miss this place the most when we leave this area for our next assignment.<//Review>

<Name>Brandon Evan< /Name><time>1496023003873< /time><rate>2</rate><Review>I have been eating here since Los Amigos opened. The quality has steadily slipped over the last few months. We've provided feedback to the staff and no one seems genuine about what we have to say. Today was the last and final time we will ever eat at Los Amigos. Every single item ordered did not match the ingredients listed on the menu. I asked for extra sides of sour cream and green sauce, was charged for them, and then never received them. The "burritos" were nothing more than canned re fried beans drowning in sauce with a tortilla somewhere in the mix. Unappetizing to look at and even worse to try to eat. When I called to politely inquire about the missing sides and awful burritos, I was argumentatively told that they were "busy" and were unable to do anything about the inedible food. Roughly $40 dollars, zero customer service, and general apathy towards legitimate concerns means I can not recommend Los Amigos nor will I eat there ever again. I will also not patron the owner's other restaurants and establishments in the community including Fratelli's Pizzeria due to the shameful lack of customer service. I wish this was the one and only time experiencing this that prompted me to post this review, however, this was the final straw. Two stars only because your food and customer service used to be something my family and I looked forward to.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c3829faaf7a15d:0x832c132abc530d5</gmapID></record>

I love this place and I eat there at least twice a week. The staff is always friendly and provide great service. The fried ice cream is to die for along with the carnitas quesadilla, carnitas crunchy tacos and the cheese enchiladas! Oh and don't forget the beans!! ❤️❤️</Text>

Went in to buy a few small parts for my old school road bike, including handlebar tape.  I looked for it on line, but I wanted to see it and touch it before I bought it.  I couldn't believe my luck when I found they had light gold tape that matched the paint color on my bike almost perfectly!</review>

I'm not sure why the low rating. I had an incredible experience! They got me exactly what I needed. The employees are very knowledgeable. I walked in and was out within 10mins. The cashier even went out of his way to show how to change my tire!! Highly recommended< /Review>

They guy seemed irritated right from the beginning. I’ve been in the store and some of the older employees seem arrogant and are less helpful than the younger guys. Customer service here ruins their rating. The store itself is actually nice. It’s a good size with lots of goodies and parts on display. I’d give it a 4 star but some of their employees need retraining in customer service and just being humble and helpful<//Text>< pictures>

Poor online service.
I was looking for a tiny support, found it on bike Bling website; ordered it, fill in the delivery address (in Qatar) and from there I got a decent 5.19 USD for the shipment of a piece that cost less than 3 dollars. As per USPS first class mail international rates, it costs about 2 dollars. No complaint about that.
But after my order has been confirmed by Bike Bling, and in process, I received a request to pay an additional 10 dollars to support the shipment of a piece that weight 5 g !!!
I contacted the company by e-mail to understand why this request, considering they already accepted my order... no answer. Instead they cancelled the order without any notice. The only message I could found was quite hypocrite "At your request, the above order has been canceled."

--
I  do not recommend this company nor website at  all.< /text>

BikeBling has been a fantastic outfit to purchase from.  The main reason is customer support and personal care after purchase, not to mention highly competitive pricing.  I have recommended friends and colleagues to them who have had the same experience.

During times like this outdoor and especially bike equipment is in extremely high demand with slow supply chains and stores that can be totally overwhelmed, so other folks have to take negative reviews with a grain of salt.  I had sizing issues with certain purchases and they were quick to rectify with options that went beyond what I would expect from a standard business to offer in addition to personable communication and fast delivery times.</review>

I had a wonderful experience with my mtb purchase.  Kerry, and John helped me over the phone. They helped me find exactly what I needed. My in store experience was also great! The people that work there were very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a new bike.<//review>

I got my Pinarello Grevil from Bike Bling after waiting for almost half a year for my order from another shop (the bike was on back order). I called to make sure they did have the bike in stock and the size I wanted. John initially helped me out and assured me they had it in the store. I placed my order on Saturday and got the bike the following Wednesday. I was excited to get my order so quickly! No issues with my bike upon arrival. Just wanted to thank John and David again for the help - great communication and customer service from this shop.< /review>

<Review>I was skeptical, as I am with all internet sales, but this place is legit!!! The salesman at the store answered when I called, I explained what I was looking for and then he gave me the owner, Kerry's number. I did as told and left a message and my call was returned within an hour or two which I consider very good considering the calls they must get. I explained what I wanted, he looked up when he would have it, and I actually opted for a bike he had in stock which was an 2021 Orbea FS Wild M-10. We worked out the deal and within about 10 minutes he had reserved me a bike and told me the day I would get it. Well it showed up as he promised as he gave me tracking on it so I was well aware of where it was. The bike was nearly completely assembled, I had to only put on the front wheel and the bars. It had a type of plastic wrap over the entire frame, then it had foam over that, and cardboard between an parts that could scratch the frame. It was perfect!!!!! Thanks to Kerry, his sales crew, and Bikebling in general!!!< /Review>< Resp>

< Review>
Ordered a bike pannier in December at perhaps a too good price (pannier + tube to get over $50 free shipping)   Got the confirmation,  product never arrived but never charged either.  However,  about that time my CC number used  to buy a $200 blanket at Pendleton's.   Okay,  circumstantial to be sure But coincidental purchase on west coast while I live on east coast and don't know anyone out there.   Be careful.< /Review>

Great group of folks.  I ordered a bike a while back, and they had trouble getting it due to the manufacturer’s issues.  I called them up and talked through what they could get or had.  Luckily my second choice was in stock.  Got a great deal, they had the bike packed up and ready to ship that same day.  Received the bike same week.  Took me 30 minutes from the time I saw the box in my driveway to having it on my bike stand and ready to go (minus the pedals, took me longer to find what I had done with them from my previous bike).  Bikebling did a fantastic job on packaging the bike, it was tuned and ready to go.  I had bought my wife a Yeti from another online store before, and their prep work was not near as thorough as Bikeblings.  I would not hesitate to buy a bike from them online at all.  I do not live near a Niner dealer, so online is about my only choice.  And I would highly recommend you checking them out.  Hopefully if I am ever near their store I can check them out in person.    If you check out the photo, you can see the box they shipped the bike in... no marks, no dents.</Text>

Best price I found on my new Niner RLT9. Service and delivery were great, even during the pandemic. Pro build was was on point..it took 15min to put the drop bars, seat post, and front wheel on. No other adjustment was needed.  I highly recommend this shop!<//review>

<Text>Worst service ever of any online bike parts store that I've used.  Didn't honor their $5 off offer for signing up on their e-list.  Placed my order 17 days ago, and it still hadn't shipped, with no notification or updates to the customer.  Maybe the in-store experience is different, but the phone customer service rep was not responsive or helpful.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>Horrible horrible customer service. Three months after ordering a product I still haven’t got it. When asking a question, receive a computer generated response telling you how much they care about you. They are offering products on their website that they do not have in the store, then they expect you to wait to get them. I highly suggest you go elsewhere to buy anything.<//review><Rating>1< /Rating>< user>

Mid-February I ordered a bike from Bike Bling as an early March birthday gift.  Kerry worked with me to find just the right bike (components, size, color), kept me apprised of the delivery status from the manufacturer to Bike Bling, then shipped it from Bike Bling asap as promised.  It did not arrive by the March birthday date, but Kerry always responded to my emails and calls in a timely, good humored, professional manner - giving me confidence the bike was going to arrive, which it did.  And the recipient couldn't be happier.  Thanks Kerry & Bike Bling!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>Hello, Can some one tell me if Bike Bling either has new contact info or if they went under... (I hope not) Been waiting on a Lezyne Bike Light for over a month now.

Several weeks ago I was told due to covid that things are moving really slow, understandable. But I have tried several times to call them and no answer... I hope things are ok. COVID is hard for these small businesses.<//text>< Date>

<review>Terrible customer service. I know there is a shortage of bike parts. After ordering my rear wheel, which showed as “in stock”, I received an initial email saying that it was “in process”. Waited a couple weeks and checked order status....”in process”. Waited a month and called to cancel order. Unfortunately I was duped into believing that my order would soon be fulfilled as was stated by the employee “it shows we are getting them in in a few days, you’ll get it by Friday.” Friday comes and goes, then two Fridays, three Fridays. Call back to inquire. Got a long explanation of how they aren’t getting parts in time and distributors keep pushing back timelines. Asked him who and where the product was coming from then did a little investigation by calling the distributor. Bikebling was blowing smoke because the company had them in stock. I still wasn’t sure so I went to my local bike shop and asked if they could get the wheel ordered through the distributor just to check and see if it would work. He was able to order and get a confirmed delivery date. Don’t know what is causing the problems at bikebling but never attempting a purchase from them again. Complete waste of time. Also called to cancel my order and the employee was a complete jerk on the phone.</review>< Pictures>

I See all the online order negative reviews, but I can tell you in person is no good either.
You might be OK if you avoid any dealings with the owner, but if you do interface with him, be prepared for him to suddenly go postal for no reason whatsoever.
Plenty of other bike shops in town that actually care for their customers and deserve your business.  Bike Bling does not.< /Review>

<Review>I found a great deal on their website for a 2019 Niner mountain bike. I called to make sure the bike was in stock before purchasing it online. The person I spoke to gave me the owner's phone number (Kerry) and said he'd take care of me. Boy, he sure did. He offered me the same price for a 2020 model, which saved me a lot of money!! When the bike arrived it was packaged very professionally and tuned just right. I had the bike fully assembled and ready to ride in 30 minutes.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Online bike retail is most competitive. How do these guys stay in business? Website claims everything is in stock, but my order showed 'processed' for over a week. Nobody answers the phone or email. Only good thing is that they do seem able to process an email request to cancel an order. Avoid!<//Text>< Response>

4 stars because their communication could have been better. I did not receive a shipping/tracking email until a few days after I bought it. I called a few times to the number on the website and someone answered every time. No real wait.

I would buy again.</review></record>

He insisted for me to go back to the store and talk to the manager (Paul), Paul was extremely nice and helpful. Helped me get my two bikes ready and on the road, me and my wife are very satisfied with the ebikes. Only issue is that for one of the bikes we received a european outlet plug😂. Anyways, way better experience than the first time, worth a 4 ⭐. Suggestion to the owner: Kerri,you need to hire a few more people to help the employees you have, I was there last weekend and there was a line of people outside and the phone would not stop ringing, if your employees do not get the help they need they will be burned out and chances of them being rude are very high.

**First review: Horrible costumer service. Guy named "Bow" was super rude and talked to me and my wife like he was doing us a favor, it seemed like he did not want to sell the bike and was rushing to be done with us. Fyi we were looking to buy a 1,600$ bike not the cheapest item in the store. Would definitely not recommend.

I ordered this bike in June, but did not receive it until October. I love the bike so it was worth the wait. My only issue is that it was damaged when I opened it and even worse it's impossible to reach customer service. Considering what I paid for the bike plus shipping, I expected a better experience. I will not shop here again.< /Review>

The shop in the back was incredibly helpful and friendly but everyone else was chatty. So much so, that they hardly helped the customers. Also, they almost never answer the phone. Super sweet and helpful when the building isn't busy but when it is, the service lacks.< /review>

First time using this bike shop and I must say, I’m extremely pleased with the team of associates. I was in the market for a new bike and they took the time to show me the options. They have a vast selection of product available. I wound up buying an Orbea gain m30. Couldn’t be happier with the purchase. Kerry and his team are spot on! 👍 Will be doing business with again and I will be recommending the rest of my team to visit this shop.</Text>

I’ve never given a review before in my life, but these guys deserve 0 stars. Placed an order and promptly received an order confirmation, and then nothing...I sent several emails to no response, called and called and called, and no one answers. Finally I sent an email requesting to cancel my order and received an email confirming my cancellation.  How could they not respond to all my other communications, but promptly cancel my order?With the amount of online distributors these days, you can’t afford to have terrible customer service.<//text>

Ordered a bike light from them a year ago, and just ordered a bike helmet.  Prices were good, shipping was fast and communication was as expected.  Would recommend.</text>

< review>
I placed an order with bikebling.com on 8/29/2020 and received a confirmation email with the order details but no shipping date estimate or any other kind of status indication.  I waited over a week for some sort of status update such as "shipped", "backordered", etc. but never received one.  On September 2 I sent an email to bikebling and received an automated email response that essentially said "have patience with us, we are busy" (paraphrased).  I waited a few more days but no specific response ever came.  On September 5 I reached out again using their online inquiry form and I did not even receive an automated response that time.  I also called on September 5 but no answer.  I called twice so far on September 8 but the phone just rings forever and is then finally disconnected; no voicemail, callback request, etc.  I understand that all bike shops are slammed right now but I need a status update at the very least.  If I knew that my bike is backordered then I could plan accordingly but the lack of communication is UNACCEPTABLE.  I am now left hanging in the wind not knowing what to do.  This was a birthday present for my son on his 13th birthday and if I had known that bikebling was this unprofessional, I certainly would have shopped elsewhere.  It is now past my son's birthday and all I could give him was a printed receipt and my assurance that he will get his bike sooner or later but I don't know when because bikebling is not communicating and is not able to be reached.  At this point I would have to warn anyone not to order anything from bikebling.com.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>All right!...I've read all the negative reviews.  I had to look into this myself. Because BikeBling is one of the pro bike shops that sold two of the emtb I was interested in. So, I called BikeBling...spoke to a sales per for guidance...got guidance...he then asked me the call Kerry (owner) for further advice.   Kerry..set me up with a trail ride of the two emtb I was interested in (Rip and Wild).  Rip was in...Wild was being shipped from Spain. Spain delivered, I connected with Juan in the back of the house..I drove 2.5 hours to test ride the bikes...Bo was assigned to me for the test ride and answer all the questions I had...wow! I chose my emtb and off I went...I love my new emtb!  Thank you BikeBling, Kerry, Juan, and Bo.

Very happy, satisfied and content with my purchase.   Word of advise...look into reviews with a grain of salt...especially the negative ones. Two sides to every story! Cheers! Keep pedaling!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Unfortunately, I didn't have a good experience.  Ordered Stamp 7 pedals online 9/1/2020 [website showed IN STOCK].  Paid for the item and it has been showing "In Process" for over a month and a half [as of this review, it's 10/14/2020].  I understand the current market, but, website should have shown "back-ordered", not "IN STOCK". Finally had to cancel the order.
My suggestion is to call and confirm they have the item before ordering online (website was wrong).<//review>

Believe the bad reviews. Spent 2k+ on a bike as they were the only place that had it in stock. Communication was spotty at best initially but after speaking with them on the phone they told me the bike I ordered wasn't in stock so I settled on a slightly different build.  Was looking for a specifc 2x setup. They said it would ship within a few days, which it did.  Unfortunately they sent the wrong bike. Correct size, however wrong group and 1x setup. I called several times and luckily got a hold of someone who said Kerry would call me back.  4 days later finally got a call.  He said "bikes are hard to get a hold of these days and we actually sent you a newer model so be happy with that." I really could care less about the year model, it's not what I ordered and paid for. I would expect a business to immediately try to offer either a discount, or replacement. Nothing was done. Out of absolute shear frustration I accepted to keep the bike, strip and sell the components and put a 2x setup on the frame. What a joke of a company. Maybe things are better in the shop in person, but don not order online. you will be sorry.<//Text>

<Review>I ordered an item it said was in stock . Two weeks go by with nothing. I called got a rude person on the phone saying didn't you just call last week!. I replied no I didn't but I should have.  Then asks me what I need. I wanted an update on my order. He said we don't have it in stock and haven't had it in a long time. I said when I ordered it the item was in stock. He told me no it wasn't its a preorder but it doesn't say that on the page anywhere. I went with this place because I wanted to support smaller shops but I was wrong!! Rude people on the phone, poor item updates and if I never reached out I would have just been waiting. Shop at own risk! I can cancelled my order and will never buy from this place again.<//Review>< name>

<Review>A couple simple separate orders. With 2-day shipping they didn’t process it for about two weeks and I just canceled it. Never heard from them or received either package. If I didn’t dispute this on my charge they prob wouldn’t have shipped anything and charged me. Both times.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3</Gmap_id>< user>

Rob is the man! Bike Bling got my Orbea Laufey , which was not in stock, to me within 2  weeks all the way to GA. What a great purchase! They have great Customer Service as well. I had a couple minor issues, and Rob handled it all for me without hesitation!
Thank You Bike Bling!< /Text>

<Text>I'll admit to reservations after reading some of the not too flattering reviews of the sellers web store but decided I'd find out for myself.  Can't speak to the experience of others but mine was first rate.  A two item purchase one listed as In Stock and the other a pre order.  Order was confirmed and two days later I received a shipping notification for the in stock item.  That and very prompt and polite responses from customer service with a couple of questions I had.  Buying online is always an iffy proposition but based on this transaction I'll patronize BikeBling again in the future.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Weeks after ordering an in-stock item it has not shipped, with no updates provided. Emails only received automatic responses, and numerous calls during business hours were never answered.

Avoid this company. Their products can be found at many other retailers at comparable prices.</Review><username>Konrad Goffin<//username>< rate>

Never heard of this place and took a chance on them.  I ordered my products online.  2 weeks later still no product.  I sent them 2 emails and the only response looked automated and said Covid, tough times, we're working hard, blah blah.  I tried calling the number, no one answers.  I can be understanding of tough times for business but I would expect a response to a request for a status of my order.  If you're going to sell online, you need be able to respond to your customers.  I'll never order from them again.

I just read other reviews as well. I wish I did that before.  I've opened a claim through my credit card.  I LOVE to support local.  I would have bought my items locally but they didn't have them in stock.  In fact, Jensen and Comp. Cyclist didn't have them either.  So I was shocked when Bike Bling showed them in stock.  Supporting local means that I'm willing to pay a little more and wait a little longer.  Supporting local does not mean that I'm willing to forgo customer services completely.</Review>

I should have read the reviews first before purchasing something here.

It was not the fact that I tried to buy something and they lied about their stock.

It was the fact that when I called them to cancel it, they scoffed at me like I was crazy to refuse them.

News flash: I don't need a bike like I need food and air, so don't act like it's part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I was just getting a part for fun, I don't need to be scoffed at like a teenager would at his parents.

I recommend Universal Cycles any day of the week over these guys. They are nice and respectable, and don't have an attitude when you talk to them on the phone.

Don't give Bike Bling your money. They will remind you why you don't like biking.< /review>

I also had a bad experience ordering from them. At this point it looks like a scam. I received a vague message that the parts were still in Asia so I asked for a refund. Two weeks later and they still have my money. I am going to small claims court now</Review>

Initially I had some concerns placing an online order with Bike Bling, I had read a lot of problems with availability and items actually being out of stock. Due to this, I messaged Bike Bling on Facebook. The item I originally wanted was actually out of stock but Bike Bling offered to substitute a newer model for the same price. The item (helmet) shipped out that day and was a great deal. I will order from Bike Bling again, I recommend checking availability before ordering though!<//Text>

<Text>Avoid online orders: Places order of in stock brakes, order was pending for 2 weeks, nobody picked up the phone in two days for me to cancel, but finally I axed the order from my bank’s end.  What a pita.

Update:  My return was received a week ago, & still no refund.  Good luck getting anyone to answer the phone!  AVOID!!!

I don’t know what the physical shop is like, but hopefully they are better in person.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

When I set out to buy some new bikes this summer, I realized after seeing all the manufacturers websites being sold out, that it might be hard to find some and we might have to wait a little bit.
I ordered 3 bikes from Bike Bling.com and received great service from Kerry and his sales department.
He upgraded my bike at no cost and informed me that due to the pandemic the other bikes were out of stock until October. I waited patiently  and last week received the other 2 bikes right when Kerry said I would.
People have some patience.

<text>[edit] Wow! What an improvement. The customer service at my most recent visit was remarkably better. Quite good actually. The staff was attentive and friendly. All employees were wearing their masks and taking steps to improve social distancing and sanitizing. Had a fun conversation with one employee about riding in winter conditions.  I've left my original review below to emphasize the changes and clear effort at improvement.  If they keep this up, I could really start liking this community bike shop!

I really want to like my community bike shop, but I get the feeling that they don't much like the community back. The staff is not particularly friendly.. if you can even find them. They often treat customers like they don't belong. Answers to questions are short and often unhelpful. In another obvious sign of disrespect for customers, most staff are wearing masks below the chin and don't even bother to give social distancing lip service.  I've spoken to other riders and I hear a general consensus that BikeBling has an unfavorable reputation for being unfriendly, especially if you are not a 20 something white guy that looks like a hardcore rider.  I hope they change. I really do want to like them.< /text>< pictures>

I ordered Shimano pedals from them. Waited two weeks than ask about my order. They answered that working hard to satisfy all customers and I should wait. After another week of waiting they e-mailed that the order is cancelled and an item is discontinued. They gave me an option to choose another pedals and provided a phone number. I tried to call on this phone number from and another one from the site web page. Nobody is picking up the phone.< /review>

I placed an online order on October 24th. I have yet to receive my product. I have called both numbers multiple times no one will pick up. There isn't an option to leave a message. I can understand long wait times during the pandemic but this company hasn't updated me once. I even live in the same state as BikeBling. It shouldn't take six weeks for a bike rack.I would not recommend this company for online shopping.< /Review>

<review>This is a great bike shop I don’t understand the reviews specially considering how COVID pretty much made it impossible to get a bike this year. I wanted to get a carbon hard tail last March but was about a week too late as all the bikes around the world were gone when the pandemic hit. I looked everywhere but nobody had any bikes available.

Late summer I started looking again and came across Bike Bling. I went to their shop to check it out and they were super friendly and helpful. At the end they gave a card for Kerry the owner and said call his cell it’s the same one his wife calls him. I thought there is no way he would pick up but surely he did. Completely helped me out and I placed an order for an Orbea Alana M50 due to arrive mid December.

I totally forgot about it but sure enough I got an email from Kerry mid December letting me know that my bike would be ready the next week. I went down to the shop on December 23rd to pick up my bike amongst the craziness of Xmas. They were super busy but I managed to have 3 different  guys helped me out and make sure that I was taken care of. All very friendly, super knowledgeable, and very professional. There was a small issue and Kerry got on the phone right away and solved it for me.

I can’t believe that between Xmas and all the bikes they had to deliver not to mention the lack of bike inventory because of COVID that I got my bike. This is great local shop family owned. Friendly staff and extremely helpful. I would highly recommend. It’s not their fault that COVID caused a huge shortage of bikes and parts all around the world. Give them a try.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOouJ-mpQIQkAzTLXznHiXfSqvXmwa6YXjbXaXx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

<name>Robert P.</name><Review>There is a reason this place has a low star rating. The place is a decent size, but customer service is lacking. They aren't answering phone calls and I witnessed employees behind the counter on their phones listening to the phone ring. Tried to purchase something and the first person I ask dismisses me like he was super busy. He was stocking a tire, by the way. I would not return or recommend this place. Lots of other bike shops that are more interested in taking my money.< /Review></record>

<Review>Ordered item online July 31. Zero communication about when it will arrive. I have inboxed them, emailed them, called them. No one ever answers the phone, and emails yield automated responses. Covid has not stopped other online bike companies from communicating. Simply no excuse for it. Really no stars, but I need to give one in order to post comment.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I bought a part on their website with a two day delivery and had zero updates for a week and a bit. Phone is not answering and neither does email. Given that I need the part urgently I am going to buy it elsewhere and dispute the transaction in PayPal unless they respond in the next couple of days. Either way avoid this shop.< /text>

I ordered Sidi bike shoes which showed in stock.  2 days later I had to call the store since there was no update on my order. I was told by someone in the store shoes weren’t in stock however shipment was arriving tomorrow with the shoes. Waited  few days to received an e-mail with an update but nothing. I  call store and was told by someone that they don’t have the shoes and they don’t know when they’re arriving at the store.  I cancelled my order rather than waiting for an order that who know when am I going to received it. I wish I had look at this company review.

<Text>Online ordering is a joke... nothing in stock but displayed as so, no way to contact for customer service communication - phone calls rang indefinitely, live chat is not live, no response to my emails, no response via FB messages. All I want is to cancel order, but can't manage to reach a human to do so.

Very poor customer experience - do not recommend shopping here.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I've bought things online and in person at the store without issues but their business model has finally caught up with them. Offering items for online purchase that are not in inventory was OK in 2010 but not today, particularly in the current covid-induced bicycle industry frenzy where so many items are simply sold out from vendors and not currently available.

Here is what happened: I placed an order without ensuring it was "in inventory" and did the waiting game like others have explained, (1) waiting for an "order has shipped" and tracking number email, (2) contacting them by email (2 times over 2 weeks) and  eventually getting a response explaining they are "expecting shipment from the vendor," (3) doing it again a week later and getting a similar response, (4) finally reaching out to the vendor to find out they have none in stock and can't provide an ETA on shipment of the item to any dealers, (5) calling Bike Bling but never able to speak with anyone to cancel the order. (6) Eventually I received a return call from a woman at BB that was very pleasant and she cancelled my order without issue.

I like this shop and will shop there again at some point but they really need to step into this decade and stop this business practice. As the reviews indicate, they are killing their reputation and business.</Review>

Worst place to order things from online. 2 weeks ago i ordered a set of tires thinking i would get it by next week or ATLEAST a SHIPPING number but nothing. Called atleat 15 times in total nothing no one ever answers. sent them an email but got an automated BS email. Dont know what to do at this point. If anyone knows where i can get maxxis high rollers 26x2.00 let me know because i have guaranteed that i will NEVER have anything to do with this place.<//Text>

<review>Won’t ship my order. Won’t answer the phone. Sends the same form response by email multiple times instead of actually replying with substantive information.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Ordered an Orbea occam M30 eagle.  It arrived damaged.  The carbon fiber frame had an area chipped with a small crack.  Bought a repair kit and i will attempt to repair.  Took the bike on it's first ride and the chain was jumping cassette sprockets.  Put the bike up to adjust the derailleur and noticed the derailleur hanger was bent.  Had to order replacement.  For the money I paid to have it arrive this damaged is normally unacceptable,  but what do ya do, ship it back?  Yes, if the damage is so extensive and expensive.  Can't get in touch with customer service. Fortunately, I could repair at minimal cost, but I'll never do business with bikebling again and I'll never order a bike online.<//Review>< Pics>

I ordered 2 bicycles on July 3rd and as of October 6th, they have yet to arrive. I understand we are in the midst of a pandemic, thus, that is not my issue. The issue is that I have been calling everyday for a week to check the status, yet they never respond. I’ve also emailed and engaged in the online chat, also to no response. I would really appreciate a response, as this is quite frustrating. To date, I really have never experience more absent customer service.<//review>

Good selection of tires and parts,  shoes helmets,  & riding clothes.   The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and helpful.    Like most all bike shops these days they are loaded with service work so it takes 6 weeks before you can get a bike worked on.</text>

I attempted to put the item in my cart and found it was on "pre-order" status. Being that the item was a 2019 model, I emailed the company directly to inquire about the item. A representative responded the next day and was able to confirm the deal and stock.

I made my purchase and the item shipped the next afternoon! I receive the item, as described, for the amazing deal as agreed upon. Shipping only took 2 business days to Northern California. I will be looking to Bike Bling for future purchases!</Text>< rating>

Wrote an email to support a couple days ago and haven’t received a reply. It is now nearly a month since placing the order, still no helmet or refund.

UPDATE: A week later and still no sign of return label or refund. No email replies, nobody answers the phone. Starting to feel like a scam/fake business. Buyers beware, don't place an online order.

UPDATE2: Someone called and is correcting the order!

UPDATE3: Seems like the call was just to placate me, been a few weeks and still nothing. I placed this order on July 29, it is now nearly 6 weeks later and I am still out $200 and no product. I guess it is time to reach out to credit card fraud department.<//Review>< Pics>

<UserId.>105081173324644738054</UserId.><Review>Like other recent reviews, I was skeptical but decided to take a chance.   I had been looking for a used gravel bike for months, but found nothing that suited my interest.  The Pandemic also limited options.  When I saw last years Niner RLT 9 on sale at Bike Bling, I couldn't turn it down.  I figured my credit card would protect me.  I remained cautiously optimistic.

I was a bit overzealous due to other reviews - so emailed the bike shop twice over two weeks.  Both emails were responded to.  Like others, I was told I would be upgraded to a 2021 model at the same price - I presume due to inaccuracies in inventory and the web site.  Image my surprise when my bike arrived in less than 2 weeks.  It was assembled to near completion and gearing was spot-on.  Bike was in excellent condition.

I presume the Pandemic had a lot to do with many of the negative reviews previously< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3</gmap_id>< resp>

<review>Giving 5 stars for customer service.  I too experienced a delayed email response from BikeBling to a change in order due to delayed availability of a Bell helmet.   After a week of waiting for a response from them, and after reading all the negative reviews, I sent an email stating that they should cancel my order if they weren't able to ship within a reasonable timeframe.  The next next day, Saturday, I received a phone call from their customer service rep apologizing the for the delay. They processed my order on the phone and said the shipping info would be sent Monday.   Sure enough, they sent it and the helmet arrived 4 days later.   If Covid has taught me anything, it is to be a little more patient and understanding that some businesses are trying their best to stay operational. BikeBling seems sincere and they addressed my concern quickly and in a very personable manner.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

This company is terrible.  I waited over a month with no correspondence from the company.  Tried calling multiple times and nobody ever answered the phone.  Emailed multiple times and never got a response.  I had to contact my card company to have the order cancelled.  Save yourself the time and stress and go with literally any other company, cause they have to be better than bike bling.< /review>

<Review>Great experience shopping from bike bling.  Placed an order for a bike and the associates on the phone were extremely helpful.  I have ordered several bike accessories from bike bling and will continue purchasing from them.< /Review><Time>1604887812104< /Time><Rating>5</Rating>< Pictures>

DO NOT BUY AND AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They pretend the bike you want is in stock (it is not, and they know it). Once you put in your purchase order, they will then email you and try to lure you in to buy some other bike you didn't want. Meanwhile, you just gave them your credit card and address and spent a lot of time choosing the bike and entering your data, and you are mistakenly thinking the bike will be shipped (the site lies and says "shipping today!" even though they absolutely know it is not). It's a swindle and perhaps risk for identity theft and you will not get your bike. But now your information is out there and you will miss out on the bike. They absolutely do this on purpose. Other reviewers note the same thing. I hope my review spares other people the same danger. There are many reputable, honest sites out there to buy bikes from.< /Text>

<text>Ordered 2 helmets for my boys back in May. Did not receive any updates for over a month so I finally called. The sales person said, "oh, we sold those out the front". He then said we will order new ones and will get those out  Did not receive them. Finally, after couple of months they cancelled my order, no explanation or substitute. Don't order from bikebling or you will waste your time. Very poor customer service.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>This place is great if you are willing to overlook some communication delays in order to get a great (read: GREAT) deal on select items. Just keep emailing and be patient. If you want your concerns resolved here and now and you want your item shipped today, exactly as ordered, order from REI or Backcountry.com and pay full price. Not saying people's concerns on here are not valid- I'm just saying, this place may still be worth it to people who just care about price and are not too concerned by a delay of a couple days.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< time>

I recently was in the market for a new gravel bike. The shops around where I live did not have anything that I was looking for so I did a quick search online for any dealers that are currently selling online and BikeBling fit the bill. The online ordering process was smooth, and when they did not have the size I was looking for Kerry was prompt at contacting me and was easy to get ahold of via phone despite how much volume they are currently dealing with. They were able to get me what I was looking for and even gave me a discount to help cover the difference in cost. Everything that I ordered was packaged perfectly and the bike was at my house in less than a week. Overall fantastic experience for an online shopping experience for a new bike.< /review>

Like many other online users, we did not have a good experience. Ordered a mountain bike, expensive but marked down and surprisingly available at Bike Bling, confirmation email said to wait roughly 3 weeks to ship, no arrival estimate given. Once 3 weeks had passed, we tried to contact the shop again to see if it had shipped, or was on back order, really just any information, no response. We ultimately had to make a fraudulent charge claim. Weeks later, still never got so much as an email response.< /review><Date>1597168411584< /Date><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

As of August 2020, I would not recommend this company. At least not their online store. My order has been "processing" for the last 3 days when it should've arrived by now. No one is answering the phones or responding to email. My guess is they had to shutdown operations, but didn't bother updating the website. Pretty frustrating.<//Review>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Ordered part 2-3 weeks ago via 2 day UPS delivery, nothing has arrived. Call both lines listed on website daily NOBODY ever answers, have submitted emails NOBODY REPLIES. Submitting report to Better Business Bureau and credit card company as fraud.
UPDATE: part arrived about a month after posting this review initially. No communication ever it just showed up one day. At least the shop seems to be legit, but if so busy or understaffed as to be unable to even answer a phone they probably should not be taking online orders until they are able to - or provide a clear disclaimer that orders can’t be processed anywhere near in time . But the order DID ARRIVE. Yay< /review>< Pictures>

Similar to others, couldn't get any answer when my parts would come by phone, email, or my order status on their web site. Received the parts ~6 weeks after order.  Raised my review to 4 stars because they delivered what was promised.  Just wish they had some mechanism for indicating status of availability before you order, or at least basic ability to correspond with you about your order once placed.<//review>

<Text>I decided to take a chance on BikeBling even though there were a number of bad reviews. They had the best price on a pair of Sidi shoes I wanted to purchase. I placed the order on Sept 11 and it was at least a couple weeks before I had any indication that it may actually ship. Then finally on Oct 2 I received the shoes. If you're expecting Amazon timeframes you may not wish to order from here, but if you're not in a hurry and want good prices I would give them a chance. I didn't try to reach out to customer service so I cannot comment on that. I just figured I'd place an order and see what happens, and everything worked out just fine.<//Text>< pictures>

There Customer service is the worst! I placed an online order for $140 everything went through fine with no issues the next day I receive an email stating my order has been delayed until 2021 and we’re in July of 2020. Before I placed the order you would think it would state on there item on back order but NO! I emailed this place called there customer service which they don’t even bother in answering and I’m still waiting to get this resolved. I rather cancel my order then wait 5 or 6 months.

This has been a painful shopping experience. I purchased a set of shoes and had them shipped to my house. Upon receiving them, they were too small. I followed the directions on their website to exchange the shoes for the correct size. I didn't hear back from them for 2 days so I called the store. After several call attempts, someone finally answered the phone and provided me with the information needed, and a UPS label to return the shoes.  Sadly, UPS has lost the package. I again managed to get someone on the phone to discuss the situation. (again, it took multiple call attempts.) I've asked that they file a lost package request with UPS (I'm unable to do this since they generated the shipping label) and since they have a tracking number of the returned shoes, ship me the correct size shoes. I was told that I would receive an e-mail or a call back regarding the situation.

Here we are, 2 days later and there has been no response.

I've called several times today (I get either a busy signal or no answer) and have sent an e-mail asking for an update on my situation.

The experience has been very painful and not worth the few $$ I saved. I would not suggest doing business with this company.</text>

Doesn't answer the phone or return emails. Went into the physical shop to ask questions about what would be best for me and the rude employees told me to leave and don't come back until I know what I want. This place is running scams and taking advantage of the pandemic.</review>

<Text>Just like many recent reviews have stated, don’t order from them. Like many, I placed an order for some items they supposedly had in stock. After 2 and a half weeks, my order said 'still pending". I gave them the benefit of doubt because of the current pandemic and reached out to them only to find out the items were not in stock and that they were awaiting a shipment from a supplier. I also work in the bike industry but placed an order through Bike Bling because the manufacture is out of stock and I was okay with paying more. However, to falsely state that something is in stock just to make a sale is troublesome. I decided to take my business elsewhere and canceled my order.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Honest review from an online order. Ordered some Easton road bars online and immediately received confirmation. 7 days later the bars hadn’t shipped and zero communication. Tried emailing and no response other that auto response saying Covid had them bogged down. Next day tried emailing to cancel and no response. Finally called and got an answer first time. Guy was super nice but explained the bars were back ordered and expected any day. This was SUPER frustrating because online it said in stock and then there was never any communication that they were back ordered. Decided to try and wait it out but then found them somewhere else. Called again to cancel and no answer on 5 calls. 6th call another really nice guy with an accent and cancelled the order with no issues. Overall some good and some really bad. I wouldn’t order online from here again. Thumbs up to the two guys that answered the phones.</text>< Pictures>

I have gone to this store on three separate occasions.  One would think I would have given up after the second visit but I was hoping it would be different on the third visit.  Was I wrong!  No matter what you ask for they are either out of stock or give you a very short "You will have to call around" to find what you need.  No offer to possibly refer you on or anything.  Three times was enough for me.<//Text>

They will show items as "in-stock" on their website and allow you to purchase. Then months will go by, your items will never ship, and you're lucky if you hear from them again. If you do manage to talk to someone, they will give the "COVID-19 supply chain challenges" excuse. This is neither a COVID-19 nor a supply chain issue. Bike Bling is either wholly incompetent and disorganized at best, or straight up lying at worst.

<text>Item ordered online was on back order. Took a couple emails to get a response on why it had not shipped but was informed of the back order with estimate on a restock unavailable, so they offered a different color to speed up the process and they got it to me shortly after. For handling the situation I give them their due. In the future on back ordered items maybe the website should reflect that or a response by email that it is on back order.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5</rate><user_id>100383592625242207420<//user_id>< Gmap_id>

Service was a little slow at the beginning due to them being so busy but once I was helped , I was taken care of. I walked in with a dirty unused beach cruise and I walked out with a clean and ready to ride bike!! Andy took the time to give me some options that worked with my budget and even took the time to wipe down the bike and lastly help me load her up.  Walked out a very happy customer and very grateful for Andy's customer service.< /Text>

<Review>Calling with a simple question, when do you open for in store shopping again. Associate placed me on hold for 10 minutes. Maybe you're on one part coverage or busy with a line? Tried calling back, twice the phone just rang and rang and each time after the phone was busy. I really try to shop small but it's impossible if the associate won't even answer phone calls for a simple question.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Never going in there Again.

Terrible customer service.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Steer clear of this shop. I pre-ordered a bike that was supposed to be here in July and September they are still giving me the "It'll be here this month". Now it's " We are closely monitoring them and they will be here this month and you are first in line we are just waiting for them to arrive at our warehouse. Dude you are a little shop in Escondido what warehouse are you talking about! I even emailed them to purchase some upgrades for the bike and have them installed and they never responded back. Worst expereinc ever, like mentioned by previous reviews go somewhere else!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Same story as the others.

Nobody picks up phone calls. Emails responded by a template. Order still pending after 10 days. Just sent them an email to cancel and requested my credit card company to cancel the charge.

I am going to stay away from these guys.< /Review>< Name>

Don’t order from them. I ordered a part that they supposedly had in stock. After 2 weeks, I logged into my account and saw it was still pending. I spent the next few days trying to call them to see why. I finally got someone that was helpful and they later called me back with status saying they would have the part in 2 business days. 2 weeks later, I again spent a couple days trying to call them to find my part. This time they said it is coming from manufacturer and is 2 weeks out. I canceled my order, went straight to manufacturer and got my part in a few days for only $4 more. I don’t understand their business model.< /review>

< Review>
Thank you so much Bike Bling and especially John who works there.
I scoured stores and the internet for a particular bike computer.  Stores had none, online sites either did not have the complete assembly or it would take 6 to 8 weeks after ordering to receive it (yes, I am in the USA).  I called Bike Bling and talked to a very helpful young man named John who took extra time to help me.  He had the computer in stock, he checked the box to make sure it had all the sensors I wanted and bless his heart I received it in 2 shipping days. Just 2 days, exactly what I wanted, yes I am a happy camper (cyclist).
I am so appreciative, Bike Bling will be the first place I go to for online cycling shopping.
Thank you again,
Signed: A very happy customer.</Review>

<Review>I can't say enough good things about the staff at Bike Bling. They came highly recommended to me and they've been really knowledgeable and helpful every time. They're following all procedures to operate during this pandemic. They're very busy yet still helpful and patient with me and everyone I've seen them interact with.</Review><user>106256312860532791407<//user><Gmap_id>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3</Gmap_id><Time>1589920782916</Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>Not too stoked on my experience here. Went in a couple weeks ago with a buddy to grab some parts that we ordered online several days beforehand and were met with the worst customer service I've ever experienced in a bike shop. Not only was the order not ready but the individual behind the counter scoffed at the idea of us simply grabbing the parts off the shelves ourselves. When we inquired about the status of the order, we were sarcastically and rudely advised that "we're busy." Ha! I wish I had the luxury of saying this in my line of work. Mind you, there was not one other customer in the store at this time.

I'm in the process of two complete bike builds and am spending a grip of money in doing so; unfortunately, my business will be taken elsewhere. This is the 4th issue my buddy has had in ordering components from this business. On two separate accounts he paid for his order only to be notified days later that things were not in stock. On an entirely different occasion he waited almost 2 months for a seat that was listed as "in stock."

Y'all lost out on thousands of dollars because your staff is too impatient and "too busy" to answer a few basic questions. The irony here is that JensonUSA and other cycling companies will have a box of components to my door tomorrow, no questions asked.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>After my order didn't ship for several days I inquired about it and found out the parts that showed to be in stock on the website and allowed me to order them we're not actually in stock. There was no indication on the website ordering the checkout process that any of the items I ordered were on backorder. After looking into other reviews of this company this is not a one-off occurrence. We need less companies like this in the industry. It is a shame.</Text>< rate>

<review>Terrible customer service - believe all the other negative reviews below.
They never answer calls or emails.  Said they had the pedals I ordered in stock, but they lied and backordered them for two months.  When I tried to cancel the order, they ignored my emails.  Now, I have to dispute the charges through my credit card.  If you are looking for an honest, responsive business who will earn your money, look elsewhere.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Order a crankset that was showing as in stock at the end of July. Tried calling after 2 weeks as order was showing as processing. Received 1 generic reply in late AUGUST saying it would ship mid-Sep. I sent 2 more emails in mid-October asking for an update with no response or phone calls answered. I finally sent an email asking to cancel order and got an email the next day with order canceled due to customers request.

Terrible terrible. No one answers email or the phone. Numerous attempts made to contact this retailer. My order, placed via website on August 9, seven weeks ago, is still in "processsing" status. Their website says they're "open for business and shipping daily".  I will say that they didn't charge my card, so I'm moving on.< /Review>

Online ordering is terrible.

Note: all of my business was done during COVID19 so I sought to be understanding with wait times and the like.

However when I placed my order the items were listed as “in stock” (this is not true! They do not have the items as it appears they ship them in from vendors) they are not just sitting on a shelf waiting.

After my initial order was placed it immediately was placed in a “processing” status. I also noticed that I could not change my order as it said “your order has either shipped, or is in the final stages of processing”. Perfectly fine at that point.

Fast forward 1.5months and that status remains unchanged. It still is “processing” and it still cannot be changed or canceled. Again, I get that everything is strange during these times, but they falsely claim your item is “ in stock” which clearly they aren’t as Ive been waiting and waiting and still waiting. If they really had been in stock there is no type of shipping or process that should take 1.5 months from shelf to my home.< /text>

<review>Definitely NOT a fraud business like a lot of people claim here. This is a local bike shop. Despite the bad reviews, I still decided to buy here to support local small/medium size businesses and their employee's jobs, not keep throwing money down the throat of Amazon.

I've had a great experience buying a 2020 Fox Transfer Dropper Post online :) Ordered on Monday, shipping was a bit delayed (2 days Wednesday, not a big deal at all) using standard shipping and arrived on Friday (SoCal to NorCal). Item was as described. It was also $50 off which made me super happy :)

When you read the reviews, keep in mind that most people only tend to give reviews when they had a bad experience. Also keep in mind that this is, believe it out not, a pandemic AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. Stop bombarding small/medium-size business with phone calls and emails if your item is a few days late - this generates more delays for all of us - up to several months!!!

Be happy we can still get bike parts, many other stores are out of stock or out of business!

- A happy customer</review></record>

I don't write many negative reviews, but BikeBling has such terrible customer service, I felt compelled to. I've been a customer of theirs many times over the past several years and have had OK experiences. On June 4, I placed an order for 2 parts - $251 total. Their site showed the items were in stock and I should receive them in 5-7 business days. It was over 2 weeks and the parts hadn't arrived. No email from them advising me of any difficulty. After many attempts to get in touch with someone there, the guy I spoke with said one of the parts was on order - that's why it hadn't shipped. So I asked that he ship the in stock part and he did. Why didn't they just ship that part on their own volition?   It's now 62 days after I paid for the original order and I haven't received the 2nd part on the order. I spoke with someone named Dave at BikeBling on the 24th of  July and he said the part had just come in and he'd personally see that it got shipped that day.  Not true. Still no part. No email to advise a tracking #, nothing. I've called several times over the past couple days and after many rings,  they terminate the call from their end. And of course, they don't answer emails.   I'll never buy from these characters again. I would advise you don't, either.< /Text>

Absolutely no customer service. Ordered online nearly a month ago with no response to any of my inquiries about if and when they would ship, even though they took the payment.  Asked to cancel order and there is still no response. To yourself a favor and order from Jenson.</review>

Placed an order 10 days ago. Their website says the order is "processing". It has said that for 10 days. My $940 purchase is also processing thru my credit card. I've tried to call many times and they do not answer their phones. Attempted to email them and recieved an automated reply. Can't cancel my order on their website. ALL BAD. DON'T SHOP FROM THESE PEOPLE! I really don't even know if anyone works there!?!<//Text>

Don't try to order online. It doesn't tell if the product is on stock or not. I purchased bike tire online and they didn't even tell me its not available.  I had to keep calling to find out that they'll have it in October. I canceled the order but for some reason its still not canceled. This is by far the worst customer service.< /review>

Bought two bike tires online.  Nothing saying they were not in stock. After two weeks of not being shipped, called and asked to wait because they were essentially selling as if in stock, but then ordering from manufacturer.  Ultimately took a month to get my tires. Not worth the 10% or so I saved off MSRP.< /Text>

Avoid bikebling at all costs. I made an online purchase 3 weeks ago and the status still says its processing. Over the course of these 3 weeks bikebling never replied to my emails.

I understand we're in the midst of a pandemic but how can you not manage to ship something almost a month later.<//Review>

<Review>While reading this review, please keep in mind that my order was placed and fulfilled between July and August 2020, at a height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when bicycle stores were pummeled, demand for bicycles and service had skyrocketed, cheap and medium priced bikes from reputable brands were scarcely available, and fulfillment and service took weeks.

I placed an order for a lower end electric road bike toward the end of July. I was contacted by email a couple of times and asked to call Kerry to discuss. I requested email correspondence due to trouble with phone communication, but my email messages received only canned automated responses. The issue ended up not being discussed, but I assume it had to do with the bike I ordered being unavailable, since the bike I ended up received was a higher end model with upgraded components. My order arrived 16 days after it was placed, which, under the circumstances, was better than I expected. On the other hand, although professional assembly and adjustments were included in the price, the bike needed work on top of the simple assembly, including brake bleeding, issues with rotor rubbing, rear derailleur adjustments, etc. With bike shops in my area not accepting service work for 2-3 weeks, I had to order a bleed kit and tools, and attempt to perform the work myself. After endlessly watching youtube tutorials and several hours attempting to correct the issues, the bike now is at an acceptable state to be ridden. Fine tuning at a bike store will have to wait until after demand subsides.

I understand the frustration of customers not getting answers about their orders and having to wait long periods of time. It is obvious to me that the bikebling website is not integrated with their inventory database and the items shown on the website are not necessarily in stock. Case in point, the unavailable bike I ordered is still listed on their website as available in every possible size and color!

I personally was pleased with my order, which was received in a very reasonable time frame given the circumstances, and at a price that is several hundreds of dollars lower than anything offered from elsewhere these days. Even with the extra work I put and materials I had to purchase, it was definitely worth it. Whether such a benefit/hassle ratio is acceptable to you is for you to decide.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3< /gmapID><response>None<//response><username>papamicd0< /username>< time>

Ripped off. Promised a bike, paid in full, Never even received an update email. Took our money. Won’t respond to inquiries, won’t return emails, won’t refund money. Pure white collar theft bike shop. Have to call local Sherriff / DA and soon local attorney for our damages.

Avoid at all costs!!! In 43 years I’ve never encountered a crappier run and more dishonest company than this one. Order from anywhere else.<//review>

<text>Leaving this review in light of all the negative reviews on here recently... I have mixed feelings because I never actually received the item I ordered, after a week I read the reviews, got a little spooked, and emailed requesting that my order be cancelled as I had found the item in stock elsewhere. I heard back within a day with a cordial email cancelling my order no-fuss before my card was charged. So while I didn't get my items, I was not unhappy with the customer service experience, and I believe them when they say that they are in a tricky spot managing huge demand plus COVID-19 restrictions on how they operate. As an out-of-state customer, I'll probably wait a while for the COVID stuff to simmer down, but I'd give them another try if they had the item I need.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

They don't post on their site whether bikes are in stock or on backorder. Hard to get in contact with. Unable to cancel your order through their website. I never leave bad reviews but I've had a terrible experience with this shop.< /Review>

this place doesn't send email or confirmation other than receipt for taking your money. As soon as the money exchange hands communication stops. They do not respond to email. I called and the phone rings and rings then, the call terminates from their end.
Sleazy way of doing business. Seams like scammer.<//text>

I placed an order one month ago thinking I would receive it within one week since their website said it was in stock. I have tried to reach them by by phone but no one ever answers. I emailed them twice and all I get is a return email telling me that they’re overwhelmed with orders due to COVID-19. I can’t track my order and can’t cancel it because it says the status of my order is that it’s being  processed. I’m stuck here. I strongly reccomended you buy elsewhere unless you’re local to their store in California and can buy it there.<//Text>

Ordered a new bike from Bikebling.  They ended up being out of stock, but Kerry gave me a call and hooked me up on a 2020 model for the same price, just had to wait a few extra days.   There was a small issue with a couple missing plastic grommets, but Kerry had replacements shipped out that day.  Every bike shop is slammed right now with the pandemic, even my Jenson order was delayed by a week, so overall I am not going to complain.  I got my bike in reasonable time, communication was good considering the state of things and the price was excellent.<//text>

Same as everyone else. I was told 4 weeks for service on my bike which I figured they were setting realistic time frameS.

5 weeks have gone by. I have called everyday for a week trying to just get a status update. I either am put on hold and left, I called at opening when I figured there would be no one there. Told to call be ack another time. Calling over and over and hung up on, ignored, etc. I will be picking up my bike and taking it somewhere else.</Review>

EVERY bike shop is slammed, but Bikebling came through despite the enormous demand.  Bought a new Pinarello - shopped a lot online and found the best price with Bikebling, saved 25-30%!!  That's partly why they're so busy, I presume.  Ordered on a Friday and received my bike 1 week later. Well worth the effort to buy with them.< /Text>

Liars. They don't bother to tell you they don't have an item in stock until after you order it. Then they don't answer the phone and only give you an automated email response. The worst ever. Don't even bother. You can't give less than one star or I would have.</text>

I ordered 2 bike baskets in April. It is now almost July and they never arrived. I emailed and no response. I finally got someone on the phone a month ago who said they would look into it and then never called back. They don’t respond to emails or answer their phone. BEWARE!!<//Review>< rating>

<Text>Beware of the website. I was about to click the 'submit order' button, when I looked at the google reviews here and decided to call the place to check stock. None of the items showing IN STOCK on the web store were actually  in stock, and the man on the phone had no ETA. He had no idea when the items may arrive to them. I would have been SOL. This place needs to get it together with regard to the website, so it accurately reflects the reality of the situation.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Buyer beware that you'll likely be waiting weeks for your online order to ship. They don't respond to emails and phone lines are usually busy. Ordered a set of tires 16 days ago and still nothing, no shipment, no communication, etc. Had I known this I would've paid more elsewhere. Frustrating when building a bike and waiting on one part. EDIT: Just got through via phone, the guy was super nice and explained that they're inundated with orders right now. Went and pulled the item himself and is shipping priority mail at no additional charge. So that's helpful and appreciated. I get it but still - they should be upfront about this from the start or hire additional help, dedicate someone to emails, etc.</review>< pics>

So far 2 weeks out and still says "processing." Not sure why it takes so long to ship a simple brake lever but this is unacceptable. No way to cancel the order. Sent an email and got an automated response, no indication of how much longer it will be.
(Updated) they emailed me, now they said the part won't be in until late September. But they gladly show as in stock and take my payment.
I ordered a 2nd part from Ebay, it's already on the way via 2 day UPS Air. Bike Bling is a scam.
If you want your payment refunded just say you will report it as fraud and they will cancel the purchase. I hope this company gets shut down.<//text>

<Text>I did some online ordering from this place and didn't have a great experience.  First then never relayed that the products were shipping and the tracking never got updated so the parts just showed up.  Then, when I got a wrong part they never answered their phones to authorize a return.  Also never returned any emails.  BEWARE, there's lots of bike parts places out there, so don't choose this one.</Text>< date>

Update 3/22/19: yesterday I received all of the items mentioned below.  Overall pleased that they made things right.  Glad I started this project early in the season.
Orig review 3*: This review is based all from internet and phone. Initially was very please to get a very helpful live person on the phone and get my order rolling. Unfortunately spending over five grand didn't lend to getting my order without any glitches. Bike arrived with incomplete build, frame plugs were left out and not included. I had to detach derailleur cable and reroute to install. Had to order plugs direct from manufacturer because after notifying bikebling they sent the wrong ones. Wheelset arrived with wrong freehub body. They also sent one brake rotor in the wrong size. Lastly they didn't send any center-locks to actually attach the rotors to the wheels. They did respond eventually and I'm still waiting for the correct parts. This is about two weeks after.<//Text>

<Review>Do not do business with Bike Bling. As mentioned by other reviewers, they do not respond to any correspondence and falsely advertise items as “in-stock”, when in reality items are not. Thus, the long wait for orders to ship. Non-existence of communication, false advertising and lack of business ethics is enough for me to stay away from this company. I should have looked up company reviews before submitting a purchase. A purchase dispute has been opened which takes approximately 5 weeks to be resolved.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3</gmap_id><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

After an online purchase with no purchase confirmation, I dedicated 25 days calling and emailing,  trying to find out the status of my order and an ETA for the bike. After 6+ calls and 2+ emails to customer service, I was certain of one thing: no one actually knew what they were talking about.

With the use of one-word sentences via email, the company president offered three alternative bikes, ONE of which was KIND OF similar to the bike I ordered. But I declined and canceled the order altogether since it would take another TWO MONTHS to ship.  After I opted to cancel the order, I received no explanation, no apology, no attempt to make it right... just a final email that said “cancelling”.

I was charged for a bike that was clearly never available, and the order would’ve sat in limbo until the end of times had I not persistently called and emailed. Now I get to start from scratch, just in time to ride in the heat of the summer...

I should’ve read customer reviews prior to purchase. Clearly this is common practice and not a fluke. I highly recommend customers give their business to someone who has the competence and time of day to track orders from beginning to end.< /review>

Long story short the bike you originally pick will end up not being in stock. Shortly after your order you will be told they don’t have it. It happened to me I also referred a friend before all this and the same thing happened to him. Also, their communication is pretty bad as well In my opinion. The email they sent to my friend informing him they did not have the bike was very unclear.

My husband waited over an hour and nobody asked him if he needed assistance. He only got help when they were about to close! I called and was left on hold for over 15 minutes before I hung up. I placed an order for in store pick up after talking on the phone when an employee said they had a shipment they just needed to unpack what I needed and to come on in. Now we were told the shipment is not even in the state and they can have it shipped but don't know when it will arrive. My husband drove 45 minutes after a 12 hour shift at work, wasted an hour before anybody helped him, and they just told him they will ship it....Now he has another long drive home. They will never again have our business. Horrible customer care. Bike shop in Temecula has much better staff.</review>

I had early vibes of an experience very similar to what others describe. I saw a pair of cycling shoes that were 45 dollars under what I could find anywhere else, and my size was in stock. I placed an order, waited for few days with no notification of shipping. I looked up the business, saw the reviews, and immediately became nervous.

I tried to call to reach the store to confirm the item I ordered was in stock and ready to ship. No one answered. I then sent an email requesting to cancel my order. No one answered. After calling several more times, I got someone on the phone who tried to give me the run around (as previously described, "but it's in stock and is just about to go out"), but finally agreed to give me a refund over PayPal after I declined. I received emails from them telling me a refund was issued, but they didn't officially issue one through PayPal before attempting to give me the run around one last time. Very frustrating.

Avoid at all costs, the reviews pertaining to online ordering are absolutely accurate.< /text>

4.6. Inventory is amazing for gear and essentials.  Reviews are right about some of their team members being a little short.  I get it though in retail you come across a few dummies who ask you questions with the answer already in their heads.  Give each guest a chance, then if they are a ding dong give them the shop vibe.  I came across two teammembers today that were very helpful and guest orientated. Phone doesn't get answered because they are busy, but quick solution would be to set up a voicemail or message system explaining why they don't answer the phone, or it would at least stop it from ringing so much while your there or on the line.   Have one person sit answering voicemails from 9-9:45 the next morning is something I would try implement. Great shop for gear, extras, nutrition, and quipment.   I gave them lower then a 5 star  in writing because they promised something and 4 days later it was finally completed.  Again, inventory is great!<//Text>

Completely absolutely done with this place. Will no longer spend My hard earned money with a company that provides the absolute worst customer service and expensive pricing.

I’m a long-time customer to bike bling due to the fact that I’m local. I haven’t just had a few bad experiences, I’ve had many. And I’ve seen employees be rude to other customers as well.

Let’s support a bike shop that cares for their customers. Shame on Bike Bling.You guys are lame...<//text>

Can’t get them to return our calls.  We ordered shoes over a month ago that we’re supposed to be in within 2 weeks.  They obviously forgot to order the shoes.  Very frustrating.  Trek has been much more responsive so they will get our business from now on.</Text>

Ordered a bike online during this COVID closure period. Kerry McKoy, President of BikeBling, personally reached out following my order. My bike arrived very well packed, and was promptly shipped out. I couldn't have had a better experience, especially during limited business operations at this time.</text>

<review>One Word CORONA.  I dealt directly with Kerry, he was fantastic answers his phone, and had a bike (Orbea Wild FS Team edition) from Spain to my home in Boston in ten days.  Ignore the bad reviews, Bikebling's business is up 400% just like every other bike shop and business in the country and probably the world.  I live in Boston MA and there are people riding their bikes everywhere right now.  My local shop normally very accommodating is backed up nearly a month for repairs.  I love my bike and BikeBling< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I'm a beginner in this biking community. So when this lock down happened, I got my bike out of storage & started riding.
Thru broken spokes & getting a tune up, buying new tires, the staff at Bike Bling have taken care of me & have been good to me. The most important thing is they have helped me by continuing to have the fixes & with that I've been able to continue biking everyday.  Thanks again Kerry & staff< /text>

I recently ordered a wheel for my bike, I was originally quoted 2 weeks for arrival, it ended up taking about 4 weeks. I understood the wait due to Covid but they went above and beyond and gave me the tube and labor for free. Everyone was extremely friendly and very helpful. I definitely recommend Bike Bling for all your bike needs. Keep in mind due to Covid ETAs for parts might take longer than expected and to ALWAYS be nice to you service person in these difficult times. Thank you Bike Bling!<//Text>

Ordered a set of shimano saint brakes and accessories, they could not source them (website said in stock).  I asked for them to cancel the order and refund which was confirmed by their sales rep on the phone.  Nearly 3 weeks later no refund from bikebling.com  DO NOT BUY<//Review>

Wow....Kerry the owner, and his staff were awesome.  I bought an Orbea Terra gravel bike on line and it arrived at my house (Colorado Springs) in three days,  The bike frame itself was packed great.  During shipping the front wheel got a ding. I called Kerry and explained the minor ding.  Kerry said no problem, and had a new complete wheel with a new rotor shipped which I received in three days,   It was so nice to deal with Kerry and his staff.  They called me back, emailed me every time....the same DAY, which is unheard of in business today.   The service was fantastic and he (Kerry) gave me an awesome deal on the bike which I love.   I would highly recommend Bike Bling for your next bike purchased.<//Review>

<Text>I have flipped my opinion on BikeBling as they have done right by me since my original post.  My original posting was written on the same day my last email to BikeBling was seemingly rebuffed by an automated response.  That email contained wording expressing my frustration similar to my original post.  A day later I received a very apologetic email from BikeBling and a commitment to ship the part of my order that had been in stock.  As it turns out, 1 of 2 rotors, 1 of 2 adapters, and the bleed kit were back-ordered keeping the order on hold.  The rest of the brake set parts were in hand and were shipped to me within a few days.  While all I really wanted was an update, I appreciate and acknowledge the effort their team put in to make things better.  While I still have to wait for the last of the parts, I choose to attribute the delays to these odd times we're living in and the incredible run on bikes and bike parts it has created.  I'm not sure how long the rear brake set will hold up, but I was able to service the failed front set.  I'm still riding and feel reassured that the BikeBling team is doing what they can to keep it that way.

My original post:
"This place has terrible customer service.  I placed an order online 3 weeks ago and have heard nothing from them since my order confirmation.  I can go into the store now that things have reopened, but I would have to carve a few hours out of my day to make the trip from down by the bay up to escondido.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue for me as my workplace is nearer to there, but when I placed my order stay at home rules were still in effect and limiting in person visits still seemed like the appropriate action.  I sent one email a week after my order and got a pretty quick response blaming covid-19 for delays.  I wasn't sure if this was auto-generated, but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Today I sent another email and got a terse robo-response.  I've called them several times over the past few weeks and no one answers the phone.  You can't even leave a message, it's like yelling into the void.  Pretty soon I may be forced to find another option as the brakes I am looking to a replace are getting to the point of preventing me from riding.  I have no idea if Bike Bling is going to fulfill my order.  You would think a $500+ purchase would have their attention.  Completely frustrated with the customer service."<//Text><Name>James Heatherington</Name>< Rating>

I'm not usually the one to write a view, in this case I feel they are very deserving. I ordered a new old stock helmet through their website but inventory was gone. (Website should have removed the availability) They could have easily just refunded me and apologized for the error. Instead  they offered an upgrade, the monetary difference was not trivial either. It speaks volumes when a business goes out of its way to right an error (even if it was an automated website malfunction). Cherry on top, it arrived two days later! I'm definitely a satisfied customer and I will be shopping with Bikebling again.</Review>

<Review>I placed an online order for a helmet for my brother. *Note- It was during Covid shelter in place so I was patient. After 1 week no email confirmation or order confirmation. I have since sent 3 emails and called 4 times and phone rings forever and no one answers. 3 weeks later after writing a 4th email I get an email 2 days later at 11pm the order has been received! 3 weeks and they are just processing the order!?!? Still no ship date or response from the shop.  Don’t order from them, they are misleading and unprofessional. I can’t even cancel my order or get my money back unless I go through my credit card company.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>DO NOT SHOP HERE.
First of all I want to mention I will never give bad review unless a business goes out of their way to deserve it. Today I visited Bike Bling... and they deserve this review. My son was using my bike  and fell so we needed it repaired. I also was interested in purchasing him a brand new bike for himself. So my budget was about $1,000. We walked in and saw there was a customer at the front counter checking out so we decided to look around. After a few minutes I noticed the customer finished and left. My son and I walked to the back repair shop and saw the pizza guy just dropped off 5 pizzas. So I figured the owner bought his guys lunch. Great job. I'm now waiting at the back counter with my son for someone to acknowledge us. Looked around, saw everyone was grabbing pizza and walking in the back. A few guys looked at me and I smiled and they turned and walked away, pizza in hand. I'm a very patient person and understanding. I am a business owner myself. But I would expect my employees to at least acknowlege a walk-in customer, standing waiting to be helped... with his son. I waited and waited until all 4 or 5 employees grabbed pizza, still no "hello sir, we'll be right with you". If I had even that, I would have continued to wait... totally understanding I came in at the wrong time. (but think about it... when is a wrong time for a customer to walk in?)... anyway.... had enough time to pull out my phone and even take a picture and text my wife saying here we go again... Yes this was my 2nd time in to Bike Bling and no customer service.  So anyway, I take a pic, text my wife to show the pizza... as soon as the employees walked away... My son and I were done. I told my son "lets go". We turned and started walking out. Passed the front counter, even the cashier was gone. Opened the door and this is where it starts... "Hey can I help you?" I hear behind me. I say "no thanks" and continued to open the door and walk out with my son. Then I hear "what do you want?"... I say "nothing".....then "come on man, what do you want?"... I say... "I'll be back"...

Bike Bling owner - "really.. you'll be back?"
Me - "probably not after this"
Bike Bling owner - follows us outside with my son raising his voice now yelling at me - "don't you know there's a F...ing pandemic?" as he pulls his facemask away from his face and shows me he has a bloody nose.
Me - "yes i know there's a pandemic".
Bike Bling owner - says " you could be infecting me right now takes off his mask showing his bloody nose, being really violent.
Me - "I have a mask on, and my son has a mask on". I said "well if you're afraid of us infecting you why are you chasing us outside of your business and following us into the parking lot yelling at me and my son?
Bike Bling owner - "it's 3 o'clock and my guys haven't eaten lunch yet"
Me - I told him "well, funny, I haven't had lunch either and that's no excuse to provide no customer service".
Bike Bling owner - As he is now yelling at me in the parking lot in front of my son... "ya I F...ing did ask you if you wanted something"
Me - "yes as I was walking out of your business... too late".
Bike Bling owner -  is now fully yelling at me with my son next to me cussing me out saying F you... telling me Im banned from the store, F you some more....we haven't worked in 3 months and we just opened 5 days ago so F off.
Me - I said Im a small business owner and I haven't worked in 4 months and that's no way to speak to a customer yelling and cussing me out right in front of my 15 year old son.
Bike Bling is a HORRIBLE company. 2nd bad experience for me. But as a customer and small business owner myself, I could not believe this followed us into the parking lot cussing and yelling at me and my son. STAY AWAY FROM BIKE BLING. The owner doesn't give a F...K. Read all the bad Yelp reviews. I had no Idea this business was this bad.< /Text>< Pictures>

Not much communication on a delayed order, but when I called they agreed to ship what they had in stock and get the rest out later.<//text>

<review>You will never receive online orders. They will tell you “oh yeah I have it right here and I’ll ship it immediately” and then you will wait. You will call them to check after weeks go by and they will tell you that it has been out of stock. They won’t care about you or your problem, trust me.  Good customer service is going extinct in this state.< /review>< Rate>

BIKE BLING CAME THROUGH FOR US AND WE ARE IN NEW YORK. THERE WERE ZERO BIKES AVAILABLE ANYWHERE BUT THEY ORDERED AND SHIPPED A BMX FOR US. EVEN DURING THESE CRAZY TIMES AND WITH ALL THE. UNEXPECTED DELAYS THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND APOLOGETIC. VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND GOOD GUYS. IGNORE ANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THE IRRATIONAL PEOPLE WHO DONT UNDERSTAND THERE IS A WORLD WIDE CRISIS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU BIKE BLING, thanks you Kerry and Juan!< /review>

<name>Mr Trail Explorer</name><Date>1591328176261</Date><rate>1<//rate><Review>Unfortunately  its true.  Do not order from this company.   I'm ordering online duing Covid-19 stay at home.  They have items listed in stock at fair value.  But they don't send a tracking, notice of shipping and the charge is pending on my account.  So i call, takes an hour before someone picks up phone and talks.  Usually its you call it rings for 2 minutes then they pick up and hang up.  Well they pick up say the inventory will come in Wednesday and i'll have a tracking.  Well its Thursday over a week after ordering and i'm trying to get tracking details.  I called several times today, someone picks up "please hol...." and i'm waiting on hold 24 minutes and counting.  I just want to either get a tracking or cancel it and order through someone else with better service.  I've been very patient and i understand items are flying off shelves right now.  But better communication is needed.  Obviously they are short staffed.  So do try to be respectful to the employees in the front.  This is management and ownership issue100%.  28 minutes on hold now. Update, waited 1 hour and hung up. Called bank to see if they can cancel pending charge, they said it is likely to drop off tomorrow.  So i ordered through a company that gave me no later date than June 21 deliver to store with great customer service.  BikeBling lost $1300 in business today.  Go with dependable business and save your future self the hassle.  This place is the JC Penny catalog of the 2000s.  Get with the times Bike Bling or you'll be closing the doors.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dbf483a52a4a35:0xdcbb319f75c327b3</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

UPDATE:this place is a joke. if you want what you paid for in a reasonable amount of time your at the wrong place. I order a bike from them, talked to the owner kerry. told me the bike would be no more then a week, 2 weeks later i called back was told it could be up to 2 more months. Kerry told me about a bike that he had in stock that was $1500 more and i could pick up within a week. i agreed due to the components of the bike. Its been 2 weeks so i called back again and was told that he is waiting for the bike and the build kit (another week) that was supposed to already been at the shop and the reason for me to change my purchase. $3500 purchase and customer service is worse then going to a mcdonalds drive thru. still waiting. if I do not get it by next week i will be canceling my order and doing business elsewhere.............
Well i was told my bike was ready. Got there and the bike was the wrong size and missing parts as advertised like dropper post. Was told it could be a few months again for the right size then kerry the owner tried to up sale me AGAIN for a bike he had there at the time for another $1000. Never will i go there or recommend someone else to do shady business like that. canceled order and still waiting on my money. lets see if he like it when he has to show up for court.

-Online Store Purchase:
I would not recommend using this company to purchase parts online. I paid an extra fee for two day shipping. It has now been over a week and they haven't even started the shipping process. I have been emailing their sales department with two delayed shipping dates being assured, however once I started to question the validity of the transaction and began to ask for a refund their responses have stopped all together. Seems to be a very poorly operated company.<//text>

Not the best of online experiences, granted Covid hasn't helped anyone.

Ordered a helmet and stem, no response other than an email msg that an order has been placed. About 2 weeks later I finally get a response telling me the color and size is not in stock and they'll give another deal with another helmet, I'm thinking that's cool. However, there is some bs $10 charge for shipping a helmet.

They say the Bell helmets fit a little small so I go ahead with the large vs. medium (I should've stuck with the medium). I get an email the items finally ship, ONLY the helmet arrives which is too big and NO STEM, again no response after trying to contact regarding the order/shipping glitch. If this doesn't get resolved within the next few days, I'll be filing a charge back with card company.</text>

When I ordered my Sunday High C 29 At first I was really suspect about this store when I started reading the other reviews so I gave them a call they answered every time and gave me their emails and kept in contact I got my bike a month later but we’re in the middle of a pandemic be understandable to the bike industry’s struggle they’re going through it’s not their fault you decided to get a bike because everybody else did.<//review>

<text>A kind of scare reading some reviews but I decided to try. I placed the order online and I got an email from Kerry to call him. When I called, bike was not available but he was able to give me a better deal if I was able to wait. Two month waiting but was a good deal for me so why not. Down payment provided Kerry sent me a confirmation by email. I sent an email a couple weeks before promised delivery date and he answered right away confirming delivery date remain as promised. Finally bike arrive on time an experience is 5 stars. I didn't ride the bike yet but looks everything is fine. I don't know if I was lucky or the people writing bad reviews are too demanding but as per my experience I will recommend to buy from this store.< /text>< name>

<review>Absolutely incredible customer service! I purchased a road bike at a very nice price. The bike came with a very small issue that isn't even worth noting. What is noteworthy is how the employee went over and above to resolve the issue. I highly recommend this company for its great prices AND excellent customer service. Kudos BikeBling!< /review>< Pics>

I will start off on my part by saying i have not received the product yet, and this review is for service. The customer service experience when purchasing your item is great. Finding products is easy and convenient. Furthermore, upon calling the store for more information about your item is as well. The staff member that i spoke with was kind and worked well to answer my questions. Now, this part of my review is more the shipping aspect. When you select shipping options, they appear to be kinda vague. Unfortunately having free shipping is a bitter sweet thing. Theres no real way to know when you will recieve your items it seems. I ordered my item 9 days ago and I have been checking the status and it still shows processing. Now, i could understand that maybe they dont have the helmey in stock yet, but thats not the case per the helpful person i spoke with. So, 9 days later... nobody has sent a package? Unfortunately for me, if I knew it would take this long, i would have cancelled my order... however you can't. They have a policy that if your order is processing, you cant cancel your order...well mine has been processing from the moment of my purchase until 9 day to now. I understand these covid times are rough, but my patience unfortunately is too i suppose</Text>

I ordered some Giro Trans BOA HV road shoes that I couldn't find online anywhere else. My size was not in stock, but BikeBling got them and shipped them to me in Canada at a fairly reasonable price. It took quite a while, but they kept me informed of the status of my order along the way. Overall, I was very pleased with the service and would probably order from them again.< /Text>

<Review>Bought a Helmet, package was delivered and dropped on the street, 40 mins later was stolen (video recorded). I didn't get any refund from the seller, but was offered 50$ discount for a new helmet (full price with shipping etc ~180$). Well you didn't give me any option to control delivery, just dropped item on the street.. So, Amazon i.e. makes sellers responsible for this.. so now I would rather buy from a huge retailer who cares more about customers and not risk with a companies like this.< /Review><Date>1573942523217</Date></record></dataset><record>

BUYER BEWARE!!! first the products on the website were not correct so I ordered something that was discontinued, which they did give me a discount on a better product due to their website issue. Then they sent me 2 different size wheels when I ordered 2 29ers and it took over 5 weeks to get me a 29er wheel and it’s still the incorrect product!!! Plus the customer service was terrible, they kept telling me my package was shipping and it wasn’t for who knows what reason and they couldn't even understand the difference between the product I ordered and what I received (little product knowledge)!!! Will never purchase from them again!<//Text>

<Date>1553228724057<//Date><Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Update: Have continued to go back even though I told myself I wouldn't. Seems like my old friend Bo is starting to get used to having me come around. He has turned out to be quite helpful lately, to my surprise he is very knowledgeable in his field. I have also taken my bike back for tune ups and adjustments, the mechanic is also very knowledgeable and has good customer service skills. Still feel the same about the prices which I would consider them to be good. Leaving my original review below, for reference. Bottom line, if you can get past the not so good customer service from Bo at first then it's a good place to shop at, everyone else I have encountered there has had good customer service skills. At first I was thinking that I was taking it the wrong way, problem is that my cousin also shopped there and told me the he felt the same about Bo. He has returned to shop there and now he gets good service. So with that said, I will be changing my rating to 4 starts instead of 2.  I would have given them a 5 but the initial encounters almost drove me away for good.

Original review: Good prices, bad customer service. I've been in there quite a bit over the last couple of years to get needed items for my mountain bike and even bought my first road bike there. I've thought their prices are competitive but their service definitely needs improvement. Each time I walk in, I walk out thinking it's the last time I will go back. But since it's within walking distance from my work I keep going back. I like to shop local but their customer service is going to make me drive elsewhere instead of waking to them. Last time I was in I asked 'Bo' a question, he looked at me and walked towards the back of the store and yelled out the answer as he was walking away.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>I purchased an Orbea Occam TR H30. They had the best price I could find on this bike.  The bike arrived when they said it would, and it was wrapped and protected wonderfully. The suspension needed a little tuning (as to be expected), but they had it close.  They were pleasant folks to deal with. I would buy from BikeBling again for sure.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<rating>2< /rating><text>Knowledgeable staff but many are unwilling to help. I brought a bike in to get service and parts. After being told I'd be better off buying a new bike i had to CONVINCE THEM that i just wanted to fix up the one i already had. They told me it would be finished in less than a week and that if it would take longer they'd call me. When the pick up date came, nobody called. So i called them and was informed it wasn't ready. A week later the same thing happened. Then again another week later.

My point is this: customer service can either make or break a company. While the employees at bike bling are very bike savvy, they don't know how to deal with customers and they don't put forth the effort to meet deadlines or even inform you of complications. Save your money. Go to Garage Works in Oceanside. Highly knowledgeable and very eager to help.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Great experience. This place is the best of the best. Great group of guys that really help in whatever regard. Their stock and supplies on hand is unmeasureable; they have anything one could possibly want. Special request? Well, they can order and you receive.

I ordered a Bell Super DH helmet from their website.  The transaction and overall experience has been quite smooth.  The helmet was backordered, and the only reason I deducted a star was for the ambiguity of how that was conveyed on the webpage.   It says "ships in 1-3 days".  After reading other reviews this can also mean out of stock.

Having not heard from them in the 3 day window I reached out to customer service via email and much to my surprise, I received a reply on a Saturday evening.   This put me in good spirits.

Once I received the helmet everything was as expected.

Unfortunately,  my helmet broke from normal use after my second ride with it.  I reached back out for help in sourcing parts, and/or warranty assistance and once again, I received a prompt and helpful response.

They were not able to provide parts but even went as far as to offer a very gracious discount on another helmet.

Needles to say, I will be a returning customer from across the country,  and I would highly recommend them to any rider out there.   I will spread these good praises at my enduro races as well.<//text>

<Text>I will rate there customer service at 1 star.
I went in on two separate occasions. Once to get a quote for a new front rim. Only to  be disrespected by the sales clerk  working the counter. I felt invisible  knowing that we had made eye contact. yet his back was facing me when I was asking about the part I much needed.
On the second occasion I had asked for my new front rim to be put on, with old outer tier to cover it. then with new outer tire that I was buy to be put on the back.
I was told it would take less then 5 minutes. and will be charged $15 for labor fee.
I left and came back 5 minutes later. I was told I was good to go. but notice that I still had the same outer tire for back. when I asked what had happen. his response was that it required more labor. IS THAT NOT WHAT I WAS PAY THE LABOR FEE FOR.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I bought a intense spider 275c from them about 2 months ago. While out riding i ran into problems. Just like anyone will if they ride a lot and hard in a short period of time. I took it in and they fixed it the same day at no charge. Best service ever.< /review>

Ordered a bike from their website, which was unfortunately out of stock.  They called me about an hour after the order was placed and asked if I would be willing to purchase the next model year for an additional $30 (well worth it) they were very communicative through the shipment process, and I received my new bike very quickly. I will be a return customer in the future!<//Review>

<Review>I had read the mixed reviews about the store so I was a bit leery of their customer service.
I visited the store early on a weekday morning when no one else was in the shop. After checking out the store for a few minutes Bo came over and asked if I needed anything.  He spent the next 35-45 minutes getting me fitted I'm a Pinarello Prince.  He fitted me on 2 different sized bikes and even threw on a 28 mm tire to make sure it would fit.  He was willing to work with me on the price even though the bike has just been released. I will be back to buy that bike from Bo.</Review><Time>1546184677088< /Time>< Resp>

<review>Be prepared to have missing parts and delayed shipping times. This place has the WORST customer service Ive ever experienced with purchasing things online. By the way their website says ships in 1-3 days. It really means not in stock.

Bought a Fox 36 converted to a 160mm and told them to leave the 180 shaft in the box. Received the fork and the 180 was missing. Called them back and asked if they can ship it to the guy I sold the fork to and they shipped it to me instead. Had to reship the shaft which costed me more $.

Called to see if they have the XT 8020 brakes in stock. They said yeah if I order today Ill have it in 2 days. Its the 5th day and I still havent received it. 3 guys told me 3 different shipping dates. One guy said it was already shipped and it should be in my box. Nope nothing. They finally shipped it today after calling them 3 times.

You literally have to remind these people to ship your item or they will "forget". Im starting to think that a bunch of stoners work at this store. I must of heard the word "forgot" like 10 times since I started purchasing parts here.

Do yourself a favor and buy your parts from Jenson USA. If you live in CA youll get it in 1 - 2 days GUARANTEED.< /review>< rate>

<Review>Let me start with the PROS:
This store's inventory is amazing. The walls are covered, floor to ceiling, with an endless variety of gear, bikes, accessories, etc. I could waste hours of my life in this store just looking around at stuff I don't even need. If you need something, chances are this store is gonna have it. The prices are pretty competitive too. If that's all you care about, this is the store for you; if you care about customer service, see below for the "cons" section.

Cons:
I have been in this store 5 or 6 times in the past 6 months, and an employee has offered help only once. Most of the employees here don't realize you exist unless you're at the checkout with your wallet in your hand. The one employee who did help me was actually great, and I wish I knew his name so I could drop it here. The few times I actually asked for help from other employees, I was treated as a nuisance, help was minimal, and felt hustled to the checkout. Even one time my family was in town and we came in after walking Grand Ave and my mom commented on the poor service!

I was in there today for about 45min trying on/looking for a new pair of clipless shoes. No one ever said "hello," "goodbye," or anything at all to me while I was there. They had the shoes and size I wanted, but I walked out, called Bicycle Warehouse in Escondido and asked if they could order the shoes. I'll have to wait for my shoes, but the superior service is worth the wait.

I want to give this store a 2/5, but the one employee who acknowledged my existence gets it an extra star.</Review>< Pics>

<review>So here's my experience with this shop. All totally internet based. The reality I have learned is that when you order something online you have to be patient. I ordered a 2018 bell super DH for my son to have on our MTB trip. They did not have the color we picked initially. Terry from bike bling emailed me informing me that they did not have the color we had picked. He asked if we wanted to get a 2019 color instead and needles to say we were ecstatic about getting to pick a new color for the same price of the sale helmets. We went back and forward because the 2019 colors were also limited. (this was a little frustrating) Though Terry was never rude his responses were short and direct yet had all the information I needed to satisfy me. a day went by and still no shipping notification. I emailed Terry to ask what was going on and he mentioned to me that the helmet would ship early next week. Man I thought, bummed a little at first I was still so excited about getting a 2019 color I didn't even think to ask why would it take so long to ship my helmet. Monday comes around and again I email Terry asking about when my helmet would ship, I also let him know we had a trip planned and that I really needed it. He replied the helmet was still on its way from Bell to him and it would go for sure Wed. or Thurs. He did also offer to get me a different color they had there at the shop already shipped that day. okay, I thought this is enough. I was beginning to get worried I might not get my helmet in time for my trip. After my wife calmed me down and talked some sense into me, I asked Terry one last question. would my helmet get here before my trip? he replied quickly that it would. later that day I got my shipping notification that my helmet was on its way. Moral of the story, if your'e used to the wicked fast shipping of Amazon and no patience I would not recommend this place. but if you want a great deal on a product, good customer service, fast email response to questions then this is the store for you. Thanks team at Bike Bling and Kerry for helping me with my MTB needs.</review>< Pics>

Awesome service. I make sure to bring cash, because I'm always amazed with their friendly, helpful staff and I always feel like tipping. My bike is essential commute and these guys take care of me. They even waived over $100 in labor charges because they didn't have my bike done in time. They understood that my bike was crucial for me getting to work on time and they fought to keep my business. I will come here for all of my cycling needs. Thanks, guys!< /Review>

Quite possibly the Best Bike Shop and bike buying experience in Southern California.
The inventory is huge.  Why drive all over Southern California to simply place an order and have to come back.  I drive 30+ miles because I know Bike Bling will have the part, item or size that I need in stock now.  From novice to professional you will always receive the quality service that you desire.<//text>

These guys are so nice.  I had to ask a million questions, and they gave me all the information I needed and more with a smile.  They have competitive prices, and great service.  If your in Escondido looking for bike stuff, Bike Bling should be your first stop!  I'll never go anywhere else.  Thanks Guys!</review>

The best bike shop for tools, parts, and gear.  Theres maybe hundreds of helmets to choose from. The bike selection is limited though, so they might not have your size or color in stock.  However they carry the higher end bike brands that I've always wanted to ride.<//Review>

<Review>I purchased an $800 hybrid road bike here (Orbea) I took it in today to get the wheels trued and a couple other repairs basically a tune-up. Only to be told that they will not repair it. I'm pretty much screwed since every bike shop in San Diego is only repairing bikes purchased at their shops. Unless they do the right thing I don't see myself coming back here ever again.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>1<//rating><userid>113650364575048332354< /userid>< date>

Look, mistakes happen its how you handle them that makes all the difference. Bike Bling fixed the issue quickly and was very courteous the whole way through. I'll certainly look at them for future orders when ready.</text>

Great selection, good prices online and in store. Anyone who says they got good customer service while in store must be family. I always leave with the conviction I won't go back. But, every once in a while, on a rare occasion (usually if I'm killing time in Escondido to wait out traffic) I will stop in. I always regret it because most of the employees are, for lack of a better word, tools. Awful customer service and they act like they're doing you a favor by letting you shop there. I have run into one or two good dudes that work there...I'm not sure if they're still there. But, two stars for selection.< /text>

I am grateful there is a high end Bike store near me. As with any hobby, activity or profession, some have the want or need for the best. The service dept. at Bike Bling is without peer the most accommodating group of mechanics I have done business with. I come in with a bike problem and I walk out with it resolved. This is unheard of at most stores were you get a service ticket and might as well start another hobby while you wait. I am a grateful customer.< /text>

The people who opened this morning don't really have any respect for someone's time. I showed up @ 9:45. The door was open but the security fence was still locked. The sign on the door said they open at 10am. Just after I showed up and an employee pulled in and soon after another one walked in. There was 3 people who arrived more than 10 min early. After 5 min I opened the door and said hello to get thier attention. The guy that responded said to give them I few minutes. So I left  and will not do business with them agai. You all are lazy and have no respect for someone's time who wanted to do business with you. Hope you all have a better experience than me< /text>

Buyer beware!  Ordered a EVOC bike case that they said was in stock and after the order was placed they emailed and said it was backordered and tried to get me to buy a different one.  I cancelled the order due to an upcoming trip.  They then called me 3 weeks later to say they have the EVOC in stock and if I still wanted it.  Told them I had already bought another one per my original cancellation discussion with them.  I noticed yesterday they charged my card for it anyway.  Of course, when I called them, AGAIN, no answer!</text>

Look, they offer great prices and that's important.. I appreciate that but telling me items are in stock when they aren't and then making me wait a month with no definite shipping date is unacceptable. This will be the only time bike bling gets any of my money, which is too bad for them... I waste cash on bike stuff like crazy.

[EDIT]

Bike blings owner contacted me by phone and after a good conversation we were able to reach an understanding. He made good and was able to make me as a customer feel appreciated and heard.

Walking in the bikebling is a lot like a box of chocolates, I wrote a review a few days ago and after re-reading, deleted it. I've been coming to bikebling for a little over 5 years and quite frequently the past two years. so I have more than a fair amount of experience with the the products, the mechanics, the staff and culture as a whole.

Ordered 3 products online. Two of which were 1-3 day shipping and the other said 1day shipping. 6 business days later no shipment confirmation. I called everyday for 4 days after and they ensured me it would be shipped that day. Needless to say nearly 2 weeks after my order placement I canceled the order and bought locally. The good: decent prices and phone contact
The bad: terrible follow through on orders.

Summary: will never recommend or order from again.</text>

<user_name>Jack Moore</user_name><date>1469239531662<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I went in yesterday and had awesome service from a super helpful, friendly associate. I bought some tires and innertubes among other accessories but spent about 130$. That guy was great, and I wish I knew his name because this review does not apply to him. In fact, he should look for a job at a better bike shop, he is better than this place.
I went in today because I needed help mounting my tires, I thought I could do it myself but I am not as skilled as I thought I was. So I go in about 30 minutes after they open and after 10 minutes of waiting for help with no one even saying hello to me I finally received some service. I asked if they could mount my tires for me and the guy who helped me said he "thinks it will be 10$ per tire." I couldn't believe that, but I was willing to pay because I commute to work and back on my bike and needed it done. So then I asked how long it would take. Now, I only asked this because I heard the bike tech in back yelling with a really frustrated tone and was being rude to the other employees, and I mean I couldn't see him, but he seemed pissed off and stressed out. So the guy who I asked how long it would take said he would check with the tech but did so hesitantly and warned me that he was very busy. I heard him ask and the tech in back immediately told him that "he was busy and Kerry told him he had to get this done." So he asked how long he thinks it will take again, and the tech told him his schedule is booked for over a week. A WEEK just to put tires on wheels plus 20$! That is ludicrous! I left, really upset about spending any money at Bike Bling in the first place. So I went to Centre City Cycles and the OWNER put my tires on for free and was pleasant to talk to. I will never walk into this place again. As far as businesses are concerned, this place is a joke.< /Review>< pics>

I was very excited to order my bike from bike bling. I was even dealing with the owner Kerry whom i genuinely cared and wanted to help. after ordering my bike, they said it would initially take a week, that week turned into 3. during that time i would call numerous times to find out the status only to be told that they needed to order it from the east coast, and that they would take care of me. Kerry, even said for my issues that he would throw in a pair of peddles at cost which i thought was a nice gesture and i readily paid him for them. Further, he said he would also include a helmet and some other things free of cost, which should have raised flags. Finally i received my bike yesterday. there were no peddles, no helmet or anything else. i was clearly very upset, i contacted them, though they did refund me, i never got a response from kerry to let me know what happened. unfortunately, i wont be doing business with them again, and i say unfortunate because they seemed to have really great prices and decent customer service.< /text>

< Review>
I had an excellent experience buying a bike, for shipment to the East Coast, from this shop.  I normally only go to my local bike shops, but the Pinarello I wanted was unavailable anywhere in the country in my model, size, and color choice.  Only Bike Bling had it.  I was little leery, due to a number of negative online posts from people who had bought accessories.  My experience buying and shipping with this shop was 100% positive.  The price was excellent, the shipping was well done, and the Pinarello bike is excellent.< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>This stores confuses me. It's a got great location. It's big. It has parking. They have a ton of stuff to buy. To go one further, they have a lot of expensive stuff to buy.

But when I went it, it was dead. Two homeless guys on bikes getting air in the tires. I wandered thinking I wanted to get a bike and start riding again. I've been out of that for a long time so I needed a little hand holding. Maybe some advice.

After a few minutes of wandering through the cavernous store I stumbled into a guy worked there. I guess. I said, "hi" and he, quite literally mumbled back, "hey". That's it. I kept on wandering. I'm sure said employee knew a lot about bicycles but he wasn't into talking. At least to me.

It won't surprise you that I left without buying anything. I went down Valley to Hidden Valley where the guy there stopped working on a repair to at least say hello and show me a few bikes he thought I might like.

Contrast that with this enormous Bling store and not a human in it that cared about a potential customer. I suppose if I needed something badly and couldn't get it online, I might go to Bike Bling but I wouldn't go in looking for help.

It's a shame. It could be a nice store. People are important and maybe, owners and managers of Bike Bling, people are more important than hiring your biking buddies with no social skills. That much seems obvious.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I ordered a part for my bike 3-4 weeks ago and still have not received the part. I received only one response from 3 emails written. My credit card has already been charged and at the end of the week I plan to cancel the Payment on my credit card. Very disappointed.</review>

I ordered 2 items that appeared in stock.  Over a week later, after 2 unanswered emails I called to find out what was going on.  I was told that the parts *just* arrived and would be sent out that day.  For my inconvenience, they would upgrade shipping.  2 days later, nothing has shipped.  What a waste of time.  Just tell me that the parts are back-ordered and let me cancel.<//Review>

I ordered SIDI shoes and due to incorrect size issue I ordered I had to return it. Guys at bike bling are very friendly and in no time they sent me return label and covered the cost to return the item as well. Also, as soon as they received it, they sent me another shipment and they also refunded the shipment cost to me. Also, whenver I called, they were very helpful to answer all my queries and assist me.</text>

This shop has more variety than any other shop that I know of in San Diego or even Riverside county . Some of the item prices can be on the high side like most bike shops but if do your research, know your products and can show them it is cheaper elsewhere they have always been willing to beat or  match other prices for me. After blowing money at Bike Bling its always nice to go across the street to O'Sullivans Irish Pub and get some great food and beer.

I was on the market for a  2017 Fox 34 fork for my build coz I'm on a budget.And I didn't want to spend more money on 2018 stuffs since the difference is minimal. After searching online , I found they have the best price and beaten all the major online store. So I called them to verify if they still have the 17s but unfortunately they are all sold out. So this guy(forgot his name lol) I was talking to gave me a deal on the 2018s and shipped the fork to me in Hawaii for free. Not only that they even cut the steerer tube for me based on my specification. How awesome is that?!!! The wait was all worth it because of the great customer service these dudes provide.

<Text>You better bring the plastic. If you're not careful, and few cyclists are.....with their wallets, that is. You could spend a bikesworth on clothing and gear, or heck walk out with a $15K bike. Among my group of friends we mainly come for a few key items like swiftiwck socks, capo/nalini gear or road shoes, but the real draw here is the mountain bike part of the store.

Remember this place is called Bike bling and not road bling or bmx bling, so they offer a large selection of everything, but compared to other shops the mountain bike portions are most impressive. Granted I don't ride dirt doesn't mean I don't know the gear when I see it. Easily 2-3 times the selection and inventory of any other mountain bike shop in North County..

It can be overwhelming because of how stacked on top of things the selection is. Like walking in and feeling like the bikes are coming down on you. You don't really get a really good look at them while on the racks. The helmet selection is kind of small and literally tucked away in the corner, while the mountain bike helmet section is wide open. Tri stuff is all over the place, but logically split between mens and women, solid womens Castelli selection which is rare. Trainers could be more clearly marked and displayed, nutrition is just a central isle without much thought given to display. Large work area has bikes being worked on all the time by the expert mechanics. The real gems are up on the wall behind the counter and of course they keep the higher end upgrade drivetrain, electronics and componentry out of reach.

Service on sales for the bikes is excellent, someone will always greet you when they see you looking at the bikes. Service from the mechanical department is amazing when it comes to workmanship. Fast, accurate, reliable. In the rock climbing world the term "spray" is something I would describe the staff overall. Always hyping and amping up the latest and greatest even if out of your price range. They don't carry anything low end and not much on sale, but for those that want the good stuff, you come here.

I would not suggest coming her to buy your first bike or a childs bike. The name implies a certain level of elitism which few people buying their first bike or their kid a bike need. Part of the elitist mentaility brings a high level of craftsmanship and quality, probably above and beyond intention, so that's nice. Their biggest weakness as with most shops is tri gear, but since bike is only 1/3 of the tri discipline that is understandable. Parking can be difficult and their fitting rooms are small, not much room to maneuver while shopping. Overall this place can be a nightmare or heaven and to me I'm closer to the latter.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Living on the East Coast in the Mid-Atlantic region, there aren't too many triathlon specific stores with great selection. I stumbled on Bike Bling through a google search and immediately found the 2xu tri suit I was looking for. I ordered it and when it arrived I was disappointed to find that there was a stitching defect by the manufacturer which left a small hole in the side paneling of the suit. I emailed Bike Bling on a Sunday afternoon, received a prompt response and within 24 hours had a new, upgraded tri suit on it's way to me. Their customer service far exceeded my expectations and they now have a loyal customer who will recommend them to all my cycling/triathlon friends!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Advice: Read the negative reviews before ordering from here.  This review is in regards to their mail order service.  After waiting for item for 10 days, I contacted site by email to ask why I hadn't received item yet.  They said that they did not have item in stock (although website indicated they did have inventory) when I placed my order but that they would order it from their supplier.  After a total of 24 days, they still had not delivered my item and didn't have any information as to if it had ben ordered or when I could expect delivery.</Text>

The website provides misleading/incorrect info about items in stock.  2 times I've placed an order for an item that shows in stock which goes into a black hole.  Only after calling BikeBling multiple times for status several days later do I find out that they actually don't have the item.   Updates and communication from them is horrible.  Totally unreliable and not recommended.< /text>

After billing my credit card they failed to send the order for over three weeks until I threatened to cancel my order.  That was my only, and last, order.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I have been cheated!!!
I bought a shimano product they claimed to have in stock which was not true. I asked to cancel the order and have my payment returned but they refused to do so.

(Original)
Me estafaron!!!
Compré un producto shimano decían tener en stock lo cual no era verdad. Pedí cancelar el pedido y que devolvieran mi pago pero no lo han querido hacer.< /Text>

If you could help us by letting us know where you saw our hours posted without reference to needing to make appointments, it would assist us in improving our communication with members who would like to visit us. For the future, we do have our most up-to-date information indicated on our website which states that appointments are required to book next to our listed hours. You can also email us at raft@raft.net to clarify any information as well.\n\nThanks again for bringing this to our attention. Let us know when you'd like to come in next - we're more than happy to help you with your next appointment."}< /resp>

Love this place! Truly cares about teachers and helping them create a great learning environment for kids. Have been to workshops and learned a lot that I could use right away. Math and science staff are really knowledgeable and are open to helping you plan lessons. Membership easily pays for itself and great networking opportunities as well. Have met some great teachers and lovely people! Lots of treasures and every time you are bound to find something and get creative for your kids. Keep up the good work!!< /text>

We love RAFT! Especially the science projects. We tried about 30 of them, and our favorite is the fizzy rockets. The staff are very helpful, and friendly. It's a store like no other on the peninsula, because they're environmentally friendly, and friendly in every other way as well.</Text>

<review>Super resource for teachers. They have everything from raw materials to complete kits for science, arts, Maker, etc. Staff are helpful, prices are cheap. When I'm planning to go, I find that the whole day I'm thinking, "I get to go to RAFT today!" Woot!< /review>< Rate>

We are so happy we found this restaurant!!!
We ordered nachos, mole enchiladas, chicken enchiladas, jalapeño and house margaritas, and flan. Best flan and mole enchiladas I’ve ever had! Wonderful owner and beautiful space. Can’t wait to eat inside at the bar! Happy to support this fantastic addition to the neighborhood.< /text>

So thankful for Sabor opening up in San Rafael! I’ve gotten take away twice now and have not been disappointed. The carne asada was delicious as was the chicken taco. Tonight  I got the chicken burrito. Before I finished I was thinking about when I can come get my next one. It is flavorful, fresh, and filling. Make sure to hit up this local
gem for delicious eats.</review>

This place is amazing, and they have great customer service.

We've never had a good Mexican restaurant in San Rafael, and always had to drive to Novato, or into San Anselmo,

This place is much better than both of the places we use to go, and this has pretty much become our favorite restaurant. We've eaten here around 10 times since they opened, and plan to continue coming.

I personally always get a burrito, and so do my siblings. They're always incredible, and sometimes they give you a massive one that you literally can't eat in one sitting haha.

I don't ever give reviews, but this place deserves it! Not that they need it look at all there amazing reviews.</review>

So happy to finally try Sabor A Mexico - it was delicious! I got my son a burrito and myself a Chile Relleno plate. My 10-year old son said, “this burrito is different but I love it.” My relleno was spicy, fresh, and delicious. Can’t wait to go back, eat outside, and try more things. Great addition to San Rafael.< /text>

This New Mexican restaurant in down town San Rafael is super good! The food is authentic, family recipes passed down with incredible service. The waitress we had was very attentive and explained everything on the menu when we had questions. Highly recommend the lengua tacos and horchata!<//Review>

I enthusiastically recommend this local Mexican restaurant.  The chips and green salsa are great.  They have 5 types of street tacos ($3) and I'd recommend getting their carne asada taco.  The staff was warm and served my table well.  I plan on going regularly to this new place. iViva México!</Review>

<Text>Read about Sabor a Mexico in the local MarinIJ.

Their story is what sold me to try their spin of authentic flavors found in their dishes.

The ordering process was smooth and simple.

I was very pleased with their customer service. I spoke with a young woman who helped me throughout the entire process.

I ordered the 3 dish combo

2 chile rellenos

1 taco de carne asada

With refried beans and rice.

I added a taco de carnitas.

To complete my order, I included a burrito with pollo asada, rice, cheese, and beans.

I trusted the cook to complete my order.

Unfortunately upon arriving home, I was missing 1 of my Chile’s Rellenos.

The food was very delicious so I was a bit disappointed that I couldn’t enjoy it entirely.

I would give a 5 star review if my order was complete.

But overall, everyone in Marin must at least try Sabor a Mexico!

A lot to like here! Family owned and operated, great food and good service. Carnitas is excellent, we order that everytime. Not a huge mole fan until i tried the mole enchiladas here...again order this everytime now. The mariscos rancheros is also very tasty. Green is creamy texture (but no cream in it) and has a nice jalapeno flavor. Solid guacamole. Highly recommend this local gem.</review>

<text>What a gem of a family restaurant! My family and I have ordered takeout from this place twice, and have loved every plate that we've ordered. The mariscos rancheros are to-die-for and my personal favorite. Husband loves the carnitas. Kids also love the carnitas and the carne asada. The floutas are delightful. The mole - wow. I didn't even know I liked mole! The salsas are home made and delicious. The green jalapeno salsa is unlike anything I've had. The family and wait staff are incredibly nice, warm and welcoming. We can't wait to go back and try more!<//text></record>

This evening we dined “al fresco“ at the newly opened Sabor de Mexico in San Rafael - it was FANTASTIC! They seemed to have a new twist on old favorites and some new dishes I plan to come back for. I chose the 5 tacos to try 5 different meats and each was excellent - so fresh, so clean and so delicious: Pastor, Carnitas, Shrimp, Salmon and Lengua served with a green grilled onion, grilled jalapeño and radish slices. The salsas were quite scrumptious, make sure to try the creamy (vegan) green salsa - so good. We had an appetizer, I forget the name, which were like lightly fried empanada rolls stuffed with cheese and vegetables with a different sort of fresh green cilantro salsa, they too were great. Solid 5 stars with excellent customer service. Make sure to meet the owners Hegal and Milton, such nice guys and Hegal is a wealth of information about the origins of all the different dishes - not to mention his grandmas mole sauce!<//Review>

Amazing authentic Mexican food , great price for delicious food. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering questions about the menu items and she was so nice! The arroz con leche is a must have dessert. The horchata was amazing, and so were the carne asada tacos. I look forward to going again and would recommend this restaurant to everyone !< /review>

Great customer service, extremely generous amount of food and the price is very good. For a 2 item it comes out to $8.18, 1 item is cheaper of course. Lots of options to choose from. Highly recommend!<//review>

They have actually found a way to make chow mein taste like cardboard and beef/broc tasteless. These were gems my whole life. My always-there-for-me; my no-one-can-ruin-you. This is the first I've left a review and its because they did it...they made tastless that which always good to me.< /Review>< pictures>

I've been to this place many times and I noticed that I always get sick from the food here. I tested my theory one day by only eating their food and I totally got sick. During my visit I looked at how they handled the food and noticed some questionable things.<//text>

<user_name>Logan Hart</user_name><userid>105603990681900914785< /userid><text>So I got a good find here. Their sales rep Freddie helped me through the whole process from finding the bike down to taking time out of his day to answer some of my less than usual questions. Let me explain, I'm a big guy 6'3 240lbs with some back and neck issues. I used to ride Cruisers but wanted to upgrade to something just as comfortable but could really take the turns. Freddie helped me narrow it down to two bikes they had in inventory and I truly fell in love with my choice. He had a real find with a 2005 Honda ST1300. The bike fits me like a glove and was super comfortable and fun on the ride home. Freddie did not just stop with just helping me with the bike, he got me pre-approved for financing. Even when his lender did not show up on time he stuck through to the end making sure I was comfortable and informed.

I highly recommend this shop, and if they don't have what you are looking for I'm sure they'll help you find it.<//text><gmap_id>0x808f77764e81037b:0x24450f1385216751< /gmap_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvlAOo-NL_OQXZIWZWxU72YZuuseC_2sVEHHOI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< time>

In the beginning we couldn’t came up with an agreement but it wasn’t his fault at all but after an hour later I went back to him and talked to him to make a deal and he made it happen, I was able to get the bike I wanted since I been talking about it for almost 3 years and he was able to put a smile on my face. Thanks to him I’m able to ride again.< /Text><Name>Eric Hung</Name></record></dataset><record>

I had spent several weeks looking for a good bike to cruise around in the Bay Area - it took a ~20min call with Freddie, and I bought my bike the same day!  Professional, friendly and knowledgeable. They care about their customers experience and want to provide the best service possible. I recommend.< /text>

<Text>I sold my first bike through NorCalCycles and couldn't be happier! I didn't want to deal with craigslist ads and endless chatting with potential customers who might not even be interested so I reached out to Freddie and turned in my bike for consignment. First of all - never has this bike seen such a thorough inspection ever before! I am so impressed by how thoroughly everything was checked, just wow! I will definitely come back to buy my next bike here when it's time and until then will keep coming back for maintenance on the current one. Thank you guys! You are the best!</Text><Date>1614313244103<//Date>< Rate>

Bought a 2016 Yamaha R3 from this place. It's my first time buying a bike and I have zero knowledge coming in. Freddie was very patient with me and answered all my questions throughout the entire process. He even went above and beyond by giving me a quick 15 min lesson on how to start riding the R3. Also shoutout to Ray for being friendly and helping me navigate around the store. I would definitely recommend this store to others as the staff there are just fantastic people.<//review>

<Text>I have been coming to Norcal-Cycles since 2015. Alfred, Warren, Will and Rob have been really great! Everything, from their knowledge, customer service, and labor rates, are amazing. Even during COVID, their safety protocols are even more than what you may expect, so you can still feel safe.  I don't go anywhere else unless I really have to.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Freddie welcomed me from the first step into the building! Everyone was adhering to all of the COVID-19 safety protocols (masks, hand sanitizer, social distancing, etc.) Freddie was just straight up cool and knowledgeable! I felt like I was hanging out with a longtime friend from high school!

Being my first time back on a bike in nearly 20 years, he really walked me through a bunch of small information that I really didn't think about. I was very interested in a Harley (which they had), but settled on an even better buy with a Honda CB1100! An absolute steal! Literally a brand new bike! He accompanied me on a test ride (he took another bike) and followed me down the road! It felt like I was riding with one of the homies!

He walked me through all the financing options and even got the loan guy to come back to the office after hours to complete the paperwork for me! When we went over the remainder of the paperwork, he pointed out every detail and made sure I didn't need to ask any questions by explaining it all to me!

I tell you, Norcal Cycles has a customer for life! Go see Freddie! I promise you, he is awesome and will take incredible care of you! Go see Freddie!</text>< pics>

No complaints! They've installed lights, fork springs, changed fluids, repaired an oil line, and changed tires for my 12' Sportster.

Loved each and every second spent at NorCal Cycles . The entire team is very well educated and all experienced riders that give you the answers you need. Freddie my main guy that helped me out did such an awesome job with getting everything lined up fast and ready for me to take the bike home all in the same day . Alfred as well helped answer my questions about modifying and getting the best I can out of my motorcycle. He’s very well educated with Kawasaki Zx-6r 636 models and even more ! Big thanks to the team of NorCal Cycles .

You guys Rock ! I’ll be back for some dyno runs 😎< /Text>

I've been to NorCal-Cycles a couple of times now:  once to replace my rear tire and the second time for some bike maintenance.  The Service manager there, Alfred, helped me choose the best tire for the way I ride and also advised me on the services I needed to keep my bike in good shape.  He did not try to over-sell me something, just gave me the information I needed to make smart decisions.  I'm happy with the service I received and Alfred;s advice.  When I need additional parts or Service, I'll be going back to Alfred and NorCal once again.< /Review>

THEY ARE OPEN DURING SHELTER IN PLACE!!

I bought a used part on eBay and came to pick it up (drove up from san jose). Daniel in the used parts department was very kind and helpful. I had a few questions about some other products for Daniel and a fellow technician and they both gave me all the info i need. This place has a wide variety of used parts for sale on eBay, and if you can't find one feel free to call and ask! I highly recommend this place!<//review>

Bought a used motor to repair my motorcycle. The original ad did not state any damage, but when I arrived Freddy and Daniel pointed out some damage that they noticed when they pulled the motor. They immediately offered a partial refund to compensate for the damage. Great service, friendly shop. Adhered to Covid-19 protocols as well. I will definitely be doing business with them again.<//review>

I came to Norcal-Cycles to buy my first motorcycle. I have ridden off-road, but I am a complete beginner when it comes to street riding.  Freddie was so, so, so helpful in explaining everything to me. He explained all about the different types of bikes, he let me sit on many of them to feel the different postures, he let me test ride two of the bikes I was interested in, all the while helping me with any questions that I had along the way. He is VERY knowledgeable! Another great thing about Norcal-Cycles and Freddie: the whole time I was in the store, I never felt pressured into buying anything, and I never felt rushed or uncomfortable in any way - this is a huge deal for me. Freddie also got me outfitted with a sweet new modular helmet, an alarmed disc lock, and a used cover - all purchases that I am very happy with. Since I am a new rider, I needed my new bike to be delivered to my home; this was not a problem for Norcal-Cycles.  It only cost me $200 to deliver my bike to my home which is 2 hours away from the store! Totally worth it!! Warren delivered my bike to me and he was also incredibly nice and helpful. Warren went over the details of starting the bike again when he delivered it, which was also helpful.  Another bonus : Norcal-Cycles organizes and participates in group rides, and Freddie has invited me to those rides since buying my new bike. This gesture was very helpful as a brand new rider, and has made me feel really included and supported by the motorcycle community at Norcal-Cycles. Go to Norcal-Cycles, you'll love it!<//Text>

Stopped by Nocal-Cycles and was impressed! Even though COVID-19 has affected a lot of businesses, Norcal Cycles is STILL OPENED and going strong! The staff is super friendly and is also handling sanitation & protection very professionally. I had the pleasure to get run down of the store from Daniel who is genuine nice dude. I appreciate their hospitality and I will be back soon!< /Review>

Hey Freddy, better late than never.... : )
I just want to thank you for your great customer service!
A few weeks ago I bought a pink Vespa from you and I am pleased to the max. I appreciate your kind, honest and supportive way of communication and the way you dealt with my (back then) still somewhat unpredictable schedule...< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I worked with Freddie at NorCal Cycle to help find a replacement motor for my 05 Yamaha R6. He was very helpful, from answering all my questions to sending me detail images of the motor. The motor was shipped to me in Michigan from California. It came on crate, shrink wrapped and strapped very securely. I had the motor installed by my local mechanic. The swap went very well, other than a minor valve compression issue whiched was disclosed to me by Freddie and was an easy fix by my mechanic. The bike runs fantastic! And I'm very happy with my experience from NorCal Cycle.</review>< Pictures>

I went searching for a bike shortly after moving to the area and couldn't be more pleased with the service i received here. The prices were barely above private party sales and included more maintenance/prep work than most places offer. Freddy was a genuinely nice salesman. He was respectful of what I was interested in and didn't try to sell me up on anything more expensive. After someone bought the original bike I was interested in, he actually pointed me to a cheaper bike that ended up being perfect for what I wanted. I will definitely be returning here for major service on the current bike and for my next purchase.<//review>

<Review>Friendly, professional, prompt customer service. I needed parts to fix my leaky forks so I thought i'd go local. I called up and was directed to Alfred who took great care of me. He had my parts special ordered and ready to pick up (with a courtesy call) in <2 days. I went in, got my parts, grabbed a liter of fork oil, paid, was invited to a BBQ next weekend, and was on my way. Then I went to make a spare key up the street at "Art's Peninsula Locksmith" to continue my mission for supporting local small business instead of using a machine at the local giant grocery store. Big mistake. I'm reviewing them next.

A big thank you to Alfred and the staff at Norcal-Cycles.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

I called every motorcycle shop in town. Norcal was the only shop willing to help me. Freddy went above and beyond helping me buy my motorcycle. Fair prices and very interested in helping the customer. Highly recommend.</text>

<Review>Integrity - If I had to choose one word to describe the Norcal Cycles team.

I had a bit of an unconventional motorcycle buying experience and the integrity of Freddie, Warren and the rest of the Norcal team was highlighted throughout the experience. There were two minor hiccups with communication about sales price and paperwork that could have completely derailed the sale and my feelings about the experience, but Freddie, Warren and the team went out of their way to ensured that didn't happen!  They went so far as to drive me to a personal appointment 30 minutes away, waited in the car for me to finish, and drove me back while the team got the paperwork straightened out. They honored gentlemen agreements and ultimately left me feeling confident about my purchase decision.

I cannot recommend Freddie, Warren and the Norcal team more! They are a group of down to earth, real, authentic individuals with the utmost integrity. They counter all the used vehicle salesman stereotypes.

Gentlemen and Ladies of Norcal, thank you for everything and getting me back on two wheels! #NoItsNotHisBike!   :)< /Review><response>{'time': 1574274895602, 'text': "Thank you Lindsay for leaving us feedback.

deserves 1, but the white boy from the parts store was friendly and he tried to help me, the other guy in the office was unprofessional and unfriendly, maybe he is too busy to go out and check my bike to estimate the service  I needed, luckily I found a place where they helped me and fixed my kawasaki<//text>

Rude service. Won’t even look at a relatively new bike to fix brakes. Bummer. Dude sounded high. I just wanted to pay labor to diagnose issue. Beat it. You are not doing good for the bike world. A chip on your shoulder works for nobody. You need to work in a factory not a customer service field.< /review>

< review>
This joint has been around forever and it seems like in the recent year or two, the scale of the business they've been getting has grown exponentially. Need parts for your bike? This is the place to get it. In need of a replacement throttle grip for your CBR600RR but you're not from the Bay? Their eBay store will cover your OEM or aftermarket part needs that'll get you hitting the road while the sun's out. Wanna find out how much hp gains your 'Busa has acquired since installing them new intake and exhaust system? Have them Dyno your scoot and end the guessing game. Need a bike? Say no mo' fam! They might just have that Sporty that will make you look badass to your lover's eyes or the Diavel that will make you look badass rich to your neighbor's lover's eyes. I keed, I keed. Riders know that riding ain't about posin' but about freedom and acceleration. And in this spot....nothing but professionals and diligent hard-workers to be found...those are well-known ingredients for success and successful, each day, they seem to be.

To wrap it up, I bid all riders a safe ride, stay on top of your bike and your bike's needs and if there are any... NorCal Cycles will take care of you and yours.</review>

I came across Kinetic Society when I was looking for custom jerseys for our small business. The second time I wanted to order from them, Frances was able to help us bring our dream jersey to life! We gave her some details of what we'd like on it and she worked with her graphic designer to create exactly what we've been wanting. She accommodated everything we asked and guided us through the entire process. I am looking forward to my next order with this amazing business!</text>

Just got my order in for a custom fully stitched baseball jersey. The quality of the jersey is amazing! The stitching detail that my jersey has absolutely phenomenal. I would highly recommend using Kinetic Society, and will order other jerseys in the future. Thank you guys so much!< /text>

So many great things to stay! The jerseys came out better than expected, came early, and we received excellent customer service. Was so pleasant to work with them on a group order and we will definitely be getting more SigEp apparel from them! Only think is make sure you check the sizing chart we had an issue that is on us because they are a little tight around the chest. Other than that 10/10!<//Review>

Kinetic Society had fantastic customer service (thank you Ted Kim), and they helped me edit my design to look awesome on our fraternity jerseys for this year. Everyone loved the jerseys, they are great quality, comfortable, and spot on with the design. They look dope. And finally, the prices were very reasonable and affordable.< /review>

Kinetic Society took 3 months to deliver a small order. When I (finally) received my order, the items were made incorrectly. I contacted support, who assured me they would fix the issue. However, they ended up ghosting me and I never received the correct items or a refund. Do not buy from this company unless you want to get scammed!< /Text>

Horrible company!!
You don't get tracking.  No updates.   Took 2 weeks to get a response a after a month of waiting for my order only for them to say I'd see it in a couple weeks.  Fast forward a month and I message again, not so nice this time and said where the @#$! Is my order!!  Got a reply saying there were canceling my order instead.   Reported them to BBB</text>

Awful experience. Received my order after waiting 10 weeks. The craftsmanship was atrocious. It looks very cheap. Also, I was sent the wrong size. I’ve received no respond regarding my complaints. If I could this would be a ZERO STAR RATING. Would not recommend.</Text>

I have nothing but positive things to say about the team over Kinetic Society. I was originally interested in picking up a couple jerseys to rep my fraternity at music festivals, so I submitted a form to customize the jerseys. Within 30 minutes of submitting it, Bryant called me up and took the time to talk to me about the specifics of our design and worked with me to come up with a few mock ups of designs that he thought we would like. After exchanging a couple ideas back and forth, Bryant was more than happy to work with us to create a design that everyone in my chapter liked. We promptly placed a larger order of jerseys....much larger than initially anticipated because everyone liked the design. Despite this larger order, we were able to get our jerseys in an extremely timely manner and the order turned out flawless. The jerseys are fire, and the experience of working with Bryant and the team over at Kinetic Society made this order top tier. We will be contacting them for future orders because it was a pleasure working with them and they know how to make clean designs.

UPDATE: Now that Covid is finally done, and restrictions are lifted, festival season is back. Kinetic society was the first group that popped up in my mind to get another custom set of jerseys. Upon doing so, I was met with the same personal level of customer service. I worked with their rep, where I chose a design that I liked but made modifications on. Everytime I wanted to try out a design, he would send back a mock up. The ordering process was super easy, and I've been kept in the loop the entire time, so I don't have to worry about my order status. I look forward to place even more orders with them.< /Text>

Edit: 1 month later. Haven't heard anything. No proactivity in communication on Kinetic's end. We're now over 6 months with no delivery of the product. Their website is flooded with recent Google reviews that are 5 stars and mention "on time delivery" which tells me they're either flooding the page with fake reviews to bury these, or they're completely ignoring certain orders.

After reading the reviews, I realized I'm not the only person currently experiencing this issue. I placed my initial order on December 6th, 2020. I've been emailing them every 2 weeks asking for updates, and they've been very responsive. They explained that because of COVID, they've been delayed in receiving materials, which is totally understandable. I appreciate the constant communication and have been more than understanding and gracious about their circumstance. However, at almost 4 months later, it's becoming unacceptable. I've gotten the same response since January 26th: "We're working on this order and it should be done this week or next!" If I don't receive this order by next month, I'll be issuing a charge-back through my credit card company. If I do receive the order, I will edit this review to reflect the quality of the product and any further communication with customer service.< /review>

Everything came fairly quickly, checked out, was a great price. I also decided to get one of their hoodies, it super comfy, dope color and sweet fit!

They are such nice people that are willing to work with you and make things exactly the way you want it. The first order we did was basketball jerseys and those came out amazing! The material was light, they were printed very well, they were true to size, and everyone loved them. The second order I did was baseball jerseys and those were even better! They are willing to change anything on the jerseys and were able to meet the shipping deadline with no issues at all. They have amazing customer service, as Ted texted me and worked with me throughout the entire process. I will definitely be placing all of my future jersey orders through Kinetic Society!<//text>< Pics>

Kinetic Society is one of the best companies to go to for any apparel needs! I am a merchandise specialist for one of the greek life sororities at Northern Arizona University and we recently ordered custom jerseys for one of our events. One of the co-founders of Kinetic Society named Bryant was nice enough to help my chapter come up with the most amazing designs! He was understanding, efficient when it came to production and communication, and lastly very professional when it came to the ordering process. I highly recommend using this company and I am beyond excited to wear our custom jerseys around campus! Thank you Bryant for all your help!< /Text>

I recently ordered a bunch of jerseys and a pair of shorts from Kinetic Society and I have nothing bad to say about them. Ted, who helped me out, was very responsive and was extremely helpful. The jerseys look great, the shorts are awesome too, and I’ll definitely be ordering from here again!<//Review>

The only reason for thr 4 stars is we have order from them twice, and each order has had an issue. The colors printed very wrong on our first order and our fraternity crest was printed wrong on our second order. The HAVE had great service and replaced every item and remade the wrong ones for no cost. Amazing customer service, but the errors are just a little more to deal with in the long run.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2c7cae485fa3f:0x228f1b6d1a60d595< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wish i can give yall 6 stars!!!

During the entire process Ted has been doing amazing job keeping in contact and helping out with my Artist LE Merch. On top of that I was able to get my order a little bit faster which is amazing. The quality in this merch is top notch and designed to perfection. I cannot wait to come back and order more LE jerseys for my artist brand!

Thank you guys so much💙🦑

The website was super easy to navigate and I had the option to customize the jerseys as well, they also got my package delivered to me earlier than the expected delivery date and were updating me along the way, keep up the good work guys I’ll be looking forward to ordering again!</review>< Pictures>

<review>I ordered eight custom-made basketball jerseys for my skate crew, Pony Rollers, and had a wonderful experience with Kinetic Society. Their team was very responsive they're sizing chart was very accurate and the quality of the product is incredibly high. My whole crew is so happy that we decided to order with Kinetic Society. Be aware that measurements are taken in centimeters so make sure to have a measuring tape with centimeters on it to get an accurate sizing. All of the jerseys are quite long which is great.< /review>< gmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I ordered my item on December 12, 2020. Currently March 7th, 2021. I still have not got any update on my order, been emailing back and forth with the company. The same response every time “ Working on the order” the website said the it will take 6-8 weeks. This is so unprofessional, there is no transparency, and the only thing that allows me to track my order is the app “ Shop “. The update for the order update has been: “ Order placed “ since December 12. This is absurd when I had to pay shipping and when I ask for updates, there is no exact answer but just a vague answer “ we’re working on it “. I wanted to buy one item to test out before I order a 100+ orders, but after this experience, I will not be coming back.</Text><resp>None< /resp></record>

I’ve now ordered twice from this company and loved both orders! The jerseys I ordered turned out great with great quality and price. The employees worked really hard to help me and my org get the best things possible and fast shipping too. Overall great products and great company, highly recommend!< /Review>

Connected with Ted for a group order, he was extremely responsive and provided really good designs. He was very transparent with the process and was able to get them in before the tight deadline I asked him for. The jerseys were of amazing quality and am ready to set up another order with them. Ted has really made me enthusiastic to work with them again and am happy to do business with them. Great place to get gear for your fraternity.</Review>

<Text>One if the best clothing printing services I've worked with! I had to mass produce some custom designed jerseys for my org and Ted was extremely helpful during the process. He was extremely responsive and communicative as we discussed the details of the order. My order also shipped and delivered weeks earlier than expected. Definitely working with Kinetic Society again in the near future!< /Text>< gmap_id>

<text>Edit: 1 month later. Haven't heard anything. No proactivity in communication on Kinetic's end. We're now over 6 months with no delivery of the product. Their website is flooded with recent Google reviews that are 5 stars and mention "on time delivery" which tells me they're either flooding the page with fake reviews to bury these, or they're completely ignoring certain orders.

After reading the reviews, I realized I'm not the only person currently experiencing this issue. I placed my initial order on December 6th, 2020. I've been emailing them every 2 weeks asking for updates, and they've been very responsive. They explained that because of COVID, they've been delayed in receiving materials, which is totally understandable. I appreciate the constant communication and have been more than understanding and gracious about their circumstance. However, at almost 4 months later, it's becoming unacceptable. I've gotten the same response since January 26th: "We're working on this order and it should be done this week or next!" If I don't receive this order by next month, I'll be issuing a charge-back through my credit card company. If I do receive the order, I will edit this review to reflect the quality of the product and any further communication with customer service.<//text><Rate>1</Rate>< Date>

<review>Kinetic Society is one of the best companies to go to for any apparel needs! I am a merchandise specialist for one of the greek life sororities at Northern Arizona University and we recently ordered custom jerseys for one of our events. One of the co-founders of Kinetic Society named Bryant was nice enough to help my chapter come up with the most amazing designs! He was understanding, efficient when it came to production and communication, and lastly very professional when it came to the ordering process. I highly recommend using this company and I am beyond excited to wear our custom jerseys around campus! Thank you Bryant for all your help!<//review><GmapID>0x80c2c7cae485fa3f:0x228f1b6d1a60d595</GmapID>< Rate>

<text>My jersey for Beta Theta Pi was perfect! And the sizing fit great! The material is really good and has a second inner layer so that you don't get chaffing from the stitched on letters. It was worth every penny and was personalized so thank you guys so much!

<Review>Kinetic Society is great to work with and easy going. They are very personable and have produced great work. The only reason for thr 4 stars is we have order from them twice, and each order has had an issue. The colors printed very wrong on our first order and our fraternity crest was printed wrong on our second order. The HAVE had great service and replaced every item and remade the wrong ones for no cost. Amazing customer service, but the errors are just a little more to deal with in the long run.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7cae485fa3f:0x228f1b6d1a60d595< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I contacted Kinetic Society about a big order for our chapter regarding Bid Day jerseys. I didn't give them much notice but they were able to workout the designs with me in a timely manner. As well as ensure the delivery by the date of the event, and they ended up getting their sooner than expected!  We were also on a tight budget and Ted was very willingly to work with us to ensure our day was still awesome. The jerseys really made the whole day, and so many people at our university have been asking us if we have extra they can buy!! So thank you Kinetic Society, and we will hopefully be using you all again!!

The jersey material was very soft and comfortable!
I love how it’s flown and I can wear it over my hoodie during the chilly weathers.<//review>

Searching for a company to assist me with custom jerseys, I came across Kinetic Society and was highly impressed with their work. I reached out for more information and Ted called me ready to make my idea come to life.  I placed a large order and needed them rather fast for an important event. Ted ensured my design was perfect down to a tee and was highly pleased. The quality was what I envisioned and design as well. He kept line of communication clear and available and kept me informed of any and every step in process of my order. The company gained a new customer with Full Court Pressed by Peter & Delilah. What resonated a lot was that Ted managed to make it happen with the pandemic affecting the world right now. Thank you, Kinetic Society LLC for the dope jerseys!<//Text>

<review>I asked for a special request from Kinetic Society to honor my fallen cousin who was on the Army national basketball team with a 1 of 1 jersey, knowing it might be a stretch if they saw the email because I know emails can be read over. Luckily they didn't and the owner reached back to me and helped make this amazing jersey for me and my family. We as Alpha Chi and my family thank you for everything you do.

Ordered two jerseys from these guys a few weeks ago because I was super impressed by the designs. The website was super easy to navigate and I had the option to customize the jerseys as well, they also got my package delivered to me earlier than the expected delivery date and were updating me along the way, keep up the good work guys I’ll be looking forward to ordering again!< /Text>

Had such a great experience working with Kinetic Society to build custom jerseys for our cancer benefit. I reached out after seeing a promoted tweet and they got back to me and were very personable in discussing our event. We communicated through text/call, which was really convenient. They sent a proof of our jerseys and worked with us on payment, since we had to pay through a school account. I will definitely return to them for custom jerseys.< /text>

I ordered custom jerseys for my fraternity at BSU and Kinetic Society WENT ALL OUT!!! There has not been any negative feedback about them and the boys are getting repping them like crazy! Ted at Kinetic Society is the man! He responded super quick, was very helpful with ideas/designs, and got a great price. If you don’t go with Kinetic Society you’re making a mistake!< /Text>

<Review>Material used is not as light and stretchy, as thought. Sizing seems to be off by one size. If you wear an XL, recommend you order a 2X. Lettering for name is ridiculously small. If i ever get another one, I wont get a name on back, unless its corrected, because of how silly it looks. Numbers and logo are ok. Coloring of jersey is best part. Unbelievably Great coloring.< /Review>< rating>

<Text>I had the pleasure of working with Ted. He was extremely kind and always willing to help! I told Ted what I wanted on the Jersey and the product he crafted was better than we could have ever anticipated. The process was extremely easy and communication with the Kinetic Society was amazing. I got a call and text as soon as my jerseys were ready to ship and also received a call ant text within a day of receiving my jerseys to ensure my satisfaction. I know Other people who have used Kinetic Society for their custom jerseys and they were works of art as well. I would 10/10 recommend Kinetic Society and their products!< /Text><rate>5< /rate>< gmap_id>

This company is great. I was a customer when they first started and still am 2 years later. Their customer service is outstanding and they produce durable, quality jerseys for competitive prices.  I highly recommend these jerseys to any Greek student considering a purchase from this company.</Review>

Wish turnaround could be faster, but when I realized how they were producing the product, I understood why it wasn't. They were responsive to questions and the product arrived earlier than they said it would and honestly looked better than I expected. Would definitely order from them again, but make sure I gave myself more lead time. Good experience.</review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I have nothing but positive things to say about the team over Kinetic Society. I was originally interested in picking up a couple jerseys to rep my fraternity at music festivals, so I submitted a form to customize the jerseys. Within 30 minutes of submitting it, Bryant called me up and took the time to talk to me about the specifics of our design and worked with me to come up with a few mock ups of designs that he thought we would like. After exchanging a couple ideas back and forth, Bryant was more than happy to work with us to create a design that everyone in my chapter liked. We promptly placed a larger order of jerseys....much larger than initially anticipated because everyone liked the design. Despite this larger order, we were able to get our jerseys in an extremely timely manner and the order turned out flawless. The jerseys are fire, and the experience of working with Bryant and the team over at Kinetic Society made this order top tier. We will be contacting them for future orders because it was a pleasure working with them and they know how to make clean designs.

UPDATE: Now that Covid is finally done, and restrictions are lifted, festival season is back. Kinetic society was the first group that popped up in my mind to get another custom set of jerseys. Upon doing so, I was met with the same personal level of customer service. I worked with their rep, where I chose a design that I liked but made modifications on. Everytime I wanted to try out a design, he would send back a mock up. The ordering process was super easy, and I've been kept in the loop the entire time, so I don't have to worry about my order status. I look forward to place even more orders with them.</Text>< pics>

Just wanted to say huge thanks to TED at kinetic society! Helped me out from A-Z to get customized softball jerseys for our Montreal, Canada Mu Omicron Zeta boys! We played in style for our first Annual charity Softball event, and raised funds to help people in need. Don't hesitate going with Kinetic, nice materials, excellent finish!

Thanks Guys!

<text>The basketball jersey I ordered took about 4 weeks to deliver, which isn't a problem because they tell you it will take 4-6 weeks, and has a custom jersey number and name printed on it. The jersey itself is absolutely fantastic, it fits greats, didn't shrink in the wash, and is just as soft as wearing a normal shirt. It looks exactly like the pictures and the printing itself is very clean and sharp. I will 100% be ordering from this company again.<//text>< Pics>

Kinetic Society has been my favorite company to contact when I’m making jersey's. The quality of the jersey’s that I’ve ordered have been very good. They make the jersey’s at a fast rate. Definitely going to stick around with this company for future business inquiries.</review>

The jersey looked better in the image than in person. I compare the quality of the jersey to the replica jersey's from the swap-meet. I recommend to at least have the jersey badge embroidered.<//text>

Amazing amount of preset design varieties and will even do custom designs. Ted was an awesome rep to work with and worked with us over months to figure out the right jerseys and for great deal. Jerseys even arrived way earlier than we expected and just like how we pictured them!</Review>

<Text>Ted from Kinetic Society was absolutely amazing. He single handedly won business from my company for as long as we need jerseys. He helped me create the exact design I was looking for and was able to have them delivered on time during a time crunch. I was so impressed with the quality of the Jerseys along with Ted's customer service. Kinetic Society will be my go to for every future jersey purchase moving forward. I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys can do with baseball jerseys!

Thanks for the help and we LOVED the jerseys. Ted - You're the man. I appreciate all of the help!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I've had a great experience working with this Kinetic Society. To date I have ordered over 100 jerseys and haven't had a single issue. They always turn out exactly how I want them and they are a pleasure to work with when making decisions. The jerseys I have received have always been very high quality and you simply cannot beat their price. Shout out to Ted for making sure the SigEps at Bradley University are looking good for fall rush!<//review>

I had such a great experience from purchasing from Kinetic Society! They were able to accommodate our time constraints for an upcoming showcase for my dance team and we were able to get our awesome jerseys outfitted by them. I have to give a lot of credit to Frances who worked with us throughout the whole process and made our experience very enjoyable. I would totally recommend and would do business with them again. :)< /Review>

Very helpful and easy to work with. Any questions were answered promptly and concisely. They really care about making sure you get what you want. For our jersey order, they felt the colors were slightly off from the mock-up, so they sent us extra jerseys for free to make sure we were happy with what we ordered. Ted’s the man!< /Text>

The best company I’ve worked with for merchandise so far. They provided a mock up for custom work exceptionally fast and expedited our shipping and provided us with updates the whole time. Quick turnaround time, our order came in fast and the quality exceeded our expectations. Will definitely stick with and choose Kinetic Society again.< /review>

Working with Kinetic past several orders has been a great experience. They are prompt, ready to adapt to any changes, and come out with quality and reasonable priced materials. Custom designs are super easy to work with, for Kinetic doesn’t have the various restrictions that other typical custom print companies enforce.</Text>

<Review>My fraternity is participating in intramurals and we thought it would be a good idea to hit up kinetic society for some fire jerseys. One of the guys personally messaged me and was super helpful with everything. We bought them in bulk and we customized all the jerseys and no one complained about the jerseys being too expensive either! Great quality for a great price. Well definitely be ordering again soon just cause of how fast and easy it all was.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Really smooth process working with Ted. I had a specific idea in mind for our men’s basketball league and Ted was super helpful and was more than willing to make revisions to get the design exactly the way we wanted. In the end, we got a jersey design that couldn’t have been created with one of those other cookie cutter “custom” online apparel tools.

The basketball jerseys turned out great and the team was really impressed to have such a high quality product at a price that easily competed with most online custom apparel companies.</text>< user_name>

<Review>Kinetic Society understands how to treat their customers right and values the concepts of efficient service. Vishesh especially has been the most helpful person of contact in my past few times ordering from this company. He was always so quick to answer my messages and always patient whether it came to answering my questions or working with me to get the final product of what I wanted. I greatly appreciate Kinetic Society and their 200% efforts towards customer satisfaction and look forward to making sure my affiliated organizations continue to work with them in the future. 10/10 recommend!</Review><Time>1556652256325</Time><Rating>5</Rating><response>None< /response><Name>Hannah Swei<//Name>< user_id>

great customer service! they will call you if they have questions about your customized order. only thing is.. jerseys are more like a cut-off (no sleeves) instead of a basketball jersey fit (tank fit). I will probably taking it to the tailor to have them cut it for alteration.<//review>

I came to KS with the task of getting approx. 100 Greek Week Jerseys. I have dealt with many different companies for t-shirts/jerseys/etc. and this has been by far the easiest and user friendly process I’ve gone through. I worked with Ted directly and he answered my countless texts and calls all day and night. Not too mention the pricing is unbeatable, don’t go anywhere else for your apparel orders, thanks again Ted. Jerseys came in and they are great quality and look even better in person, definitely use this company.< /Text>

Kinetic society does a fantastic job of working with their clients through every step of the design process and making a fantastic final product at price points that mom and pop apparel printing places cannot compete with.

< Review>
This year my fraternity decided to step up our annual broomball philanthropy event by making custom jerseys for every sorority that participated as well as brothers. Even though this was a massive order (around 160?) Ted from KS came through and made the process incredibly easy and ended up making some dope jerseys that absolutely everyone loved.

Ted stuck through the whole design process with me and made as many revisions as I wanted just so we could get that final jersey that I was thinking of. We were on a tight deadline but Ted made sure to stay on track so that we got all the jerseys on time.

I would recommend KS to anyone looking to get some dope custom apparel for their org no matter the occasion!< /Review>

Best custom Greek jerseys in the game! The jerseys I ordered for my fraternity came out perfect. Ted always communicated any updates on the shipping. Shipping took a little long but was way worth it in the end. I've ordered 3 more jerseys since getting my bulk order and the product doesn't disappoint. 11/10 recommend.< /Text>

Before finding Kinetic Society, my fraternity and I were struggling to find a jersey that we can keep for tradition. As the Apparel Chair of my fraternity, I was finally able to create and design a jersey through Kinetic Society that would stick to my organization for a very long time. As all products are made to order, the custom products had a delivery window of 3 to 6 weeks. During the ordering process, I was able to stay in contact with Ted from Kinetic Society who was able to answer all of my questions and update me with the status of my order in a very timely manner (Ted would respond within minutes!). Before I knew, it my jerseys were delivered. Each jersey was made to the exact specifications in which I requested and the quality of each was definitely top tier. Kinetic Society puts a lot of time and effort into satisfying their customers. With this being said, the quality of the ordering process as well as the quality of jerseys in general were greatly appreciated. My organization and I will definitely be returning to Kinetic Society for future orders! 11/10</text>

<Review>My fraternity has done almost four orders with these guys and they NEVER disappoint! From the initial mock up to when the box arrives to your door, everything is top notch from start to finish. The quality in both the subliminal and stitched jerseys are great and the price points are fair and affordable making everyone wanting to buy one.  We will 100% be working with Kinetic Society for any of our future orders!<//Review>< pictures>

I asked Kinetic Society if they would be able to make a custom jersey for me and my big bro. With a custom logo and everything. After working with them, they continued to send out renderings and they turned out amazing. Really well crafted and fit amazing. Will be continuing to do business with Kinetic society.<//Text>

<Review>So far I have flawlessly completed 2 orders with Kinetic Society and have loved their products. My first order was a group order of basketball jerseys that were absolutely beautiful, without a single flaw on them. The jerseys were thoroughly packaged and the jerseys arrived within half the time of any other supplier. Vishesh and kinetic society provide amazing service, I will never have a doubt in my mind that I will go back to them for future business.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< username>

<review>Kinetic Society is hands down a fantastic company with an amazing product. I have purchased several orders of jerseys for my fraternity, a few for myself, and have only had a great turn out. My fraternity loves the jerseys, and will keep ordering them for events, recruitment, athletics, and regular use. They make a quality jersey for every sport, hands down!< /review><date>1551464764090<//date><UserId.>109335014014856240066</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Everything about my experience with Kinetic was five stars.

I first learned about the company when my son showed me his fraternity basketball jersey that had distinctive and beautiful design and was of incredibly high quality. I had been interested in having some customized baseball jerseys made featuring the name and design elements of my consulting practice just for fun, so I contacted Kinetic.

Frances got right back to me and over the next few weeks, provided consistently fantastic customer service. The design I wanted was very particular (showing the look of a petoskey stone) and she was able to work with others at Kinetic to create exactly what I was hoping to have. To get to that point, Frances was always quick, patient, friendly, and professional in providing designs according to my tweaks and sometimes very specific requests.

The jerseys came a few days ago and--though my expectations were pretty high for their quality and how they'd look--I was blown away with how awesome they are. I was especially impressed with all the little details, like how the buttons on the front were seamlessly integrated with both the design patch and the jersey itself to create a completely professional look.

Before I even received the jerseys I had already recommended Kinetic to a friend and I will definitely be doing so again for anyone interested in the products they create.<//review>

I love Kinetic Society! I ordered a group order of basketball jerseys for my kiddos and Ted helped me customize them exactly to my liking :) They all turned out super cute and everyone loved them! Highly recommend ordering from this place, especially if it’s for a fraternity/sorority. Best customizable jerseys and for very reasonable prices!< /review>

We were struggling to find a jersey with a good design and one that would fit our fraternity well. I got in contact with Ted and he helped every step of the way. Very helpful throughout the whole process. He was able to customize us reversible jerseys that were very nice in both design and quality. The process of getting the jerseys is a little lengthy but it was to be expected considering we got over 50 reversible customized jerseys. We got them yesterday and they're probably the most comfortable jerseys I've worn while the quality is still there. There were no mess ups with the last names or with the sizes. Very very pleased with our order and will recommend to friends.< /text>

Kinetic Society designed a custom jersey for our chapter based on an existing design and worked through multiple iterations. Ordering was easy and prices were fair. Even though they didn't give a date the jerseys would be delivered by, they contacted us and said there was a mistake and it'd be a bit longer than expected and gave us free credit in their store. We received the jerseys around 5 weeks after we ordered them.

There was a mistake on one of the jerseys and they are sending us a corrected jersey for free.

Overall, would definitely recommend Kinetic Society — we plan on ordering from them again in the future.<//review>

Hands down the best custom Greek jerseys out there! The customer service was great,  and they always replied to any messages in a timely manner. The jerseys I had designed for my fraternity are excellent quality and look incredible. Everything is true to fit, and the product is everything we were promised. I would highly recommend doing business with Kinetic Society.</Review>

<text>I ordered 3 semi custom baseball jerseys from Kinetic Society to commemorate an up coming trip with friends. The jerseys were shipped to us quickly and all of them came out great. The jerseys look exactly as described and the material used feels great and as good as the material used in authentic MLB jerseys.

<Review>Kinetic Society provided me with the best costumer service throughout the entire ordering process. My Greek chapter ordered jerseys for our members and they came out looking phenomenal, they also arrived earlier than expected (which was great)! I would definitely recommend ordering any type of apparel from this company!< /Review><date>1548372049041< /date><username>Camryn Baber< /username>< pictures>

I have had many great experiences with this company. For my large orders I was given a specific person to work with and have continued to work with for other orders. This has made the process of designing and ordering very easy. This company even donated money to our philanthropy event. Overall I would 100% work with them again.</Text>

I had the best experience at Kinetic Society. I ordered around 20 jerseys for my fraternity in Santa Barbara and got the best customer service. I received the jerseys with no problem and FAST. Customer service was very helpful when I needed help with the specific design I had in mind. Great upcoming business - will be in contact soon.</review>

<Text>If I could add more stars, I would. Excellect service and perfect delivery time. Best customer service, they do anything their clients want. It’s the only place one should order shirts from. They look fresh, on or off the field. Their uniforms flex on every every team. All of my male, female, and non-binary friends always cop from here. In Hoc.</Text>< name>

As one of Kinetic Society's first customers, it's been a great pleasure to see this brand grow into one of, if not THE leading, fully customizable sports jersey companies in the United States. Although KS is growing at an exponential rate, they don't sacrifice quality, and their product continues to improve every day. The attention to detail on their jerseys is comparable to the biggest brand names, and their sense of urgency to get the product in your hand almost makes Amazon Prime look slow. Almost. However, with all that being said, the highlight of what Kinetic Society offers is, of course, a product that is FULLY customizable. KS works meticulously to meet ensure that your design is YOUR custom design, and I can honestly say that working with Kinetic Society is an experience from inception to completion. I am confident that I will continue to order from KS for whatever occasion requires a customized jersey, be it club sports, the next family Christmas party, or even a matching set for my future groomsmen. Thanks Kinetic Society!</Text>

Easily the best experience I have had with online shopping. The coustumer for sure feels like they are treated as a person and not just a source of making money. Would recommend to anyone who is looking to build a relationship with a customizable business that will be easily assiable.< /Review>

I've done a few orders with them and they have individualized care so someone is always working with you to get the jerseys exactly like you want them. They respond fast and the jerseys are good quality for a very good price, better than any other custom jersey website.<//Text>

<Review>Im the director of an all star cheerleading gym in torrance Ca, and this year we wanted to do something special for our kids & baseball jerseys are something they have always wanted!

After searching around for company’s we found Kinetic Society and right away they were a god send! From their outstanding customer service to amazing quality of the jerseys for prices we couldn’t believe! everything has been 100% perfection.

We have received nothing but great compliments on our jerseys from our parents in the gym to friends at competitions, everyone was dying to know where we got them & we let them know right away!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>We stumbled upon Kinetic Society on instagram and immediately were interested by their innovative and creative designs. The designing, ordering, and shipping process was the easiest and most helpful for any company we've ordered from. Vishesh provided excellent and prompt service and communication. Definitely recommend ordering from Kinetic Society and we're looking forward to working with them again.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>I have worked with Kenetic Society for two major for Phi Mu Fraternity and The Business Executive Society of Tomorrow at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa and  they have both been a success. I have worked with Vishesh for both orders and he was very nice, patient, and responded to all of my emails quickly.

For both orders my organizations got baseball jersey's and everyone loved them! Living in Hawai'i shipping is always very expensive so the fact that Kinetic Society give free shipping helps us people out in Hawai'i a lot.

Thank you Kenetic Society and Vishesh for working with me and catering to my every needs to get the design and orders perfect. I recommend anyone to work with this company for all your organizations needs to take all your attires to the next level and feel proud to represent your organization too.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My fraternity was struggling to find hockey jerseys for a charity tournament event, and with it being time sensitive, the company stepped up with affordable prices, and is helping us out with cool and quality jerseys, designed to our personalized colors! Really easy to work with and very accommodating.</Review>

Fantastic custom jerseys and company. They accidentally misprinted the color of the jerseys, called me informing me about it before sending out the order, and sent us both jerseys for the price of the original order!<//text>
