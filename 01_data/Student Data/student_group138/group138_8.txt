<Time>1599111663115< /Time><review>I had an 11:00 appointment to have four tires installed on my 2012 Tundra.  I ordered the tires from Tire Rack, which saved me about $500.  Firestone is an authorized installer for Tire Rack, which is important, because if there is a defect in the tires Tire Rack can blame the installer if there is a problem, otherwise, I'd have gone to a local independent that I trust.  I was told the install would take about 90 minutes. Tire Rack's confirmation included the quote of $80.13 to install the tires, UNLESS I  made a change to the order..  When I got there, I was told the install would be about $22 more because my tires were  "larger than that install quote included."  I went around and around with the guy about how it was between Tire Rack and Firestone, and how it was like a doctor in your network charging you full price even though the doctor had a contract with Blue Cross to charge only X for a certain procedure.  Anyway, I should have griped AFTER my tires were installed because it took 4+ hours to get the tires on.  After killing 2 hours making phone calls, I came into the waiting area to see my truck on the lift, old tires removed, with no one working on it.  I was told my "big tires" required extra effort to install.  I waited 4 hours to get my tires put on--if the local Firestone resents not getting their markup (it would have been about $500), then complain to whoever negotiated the deal with Tire Rack.  Hours I will never get back.</review><UserId.>115577025861225128151< /UserId.>< Resp>

<review>I called and asked how long it would take to patch a tire and the manager Juan told me an hour or hour and a half . Of course when I show up 15 minutes later they tell me it will take two and a half or 3 hours. Juan claimed he gave me the longer timeframe over the phone, which is a blatant lie. Bait and switch? Or perhaps the timeframe changed when he realized the repair was covered under warranty. Either way, I will not be returning to firestone anytime soon.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Hey Juan if you see this just make sure your guys double check if they tighten up the lug nuts on all tires. Had one tire with a loose lug nuts after pick up. Safety issue i say.< /Review>

< review>
Took my stock Chevy truck in to have tire's put on. Was told about a hour and a half. 3 hours later they had only done the back. Was told because the tires were so big they were having problems getting the old ones off and new ones on. This is a stock Chevy truck not lifted and has the stock tires. Then was given the excuse that they had to do each wheel separate because they could not lift it on a rack.
Very unhappy I would definitely recommend going somewhere else.</review>

Made an appointment online and called to make sure everything was good to go during this interesting time. They then stated that they don't do alignments on Tesla's even though online I marked my car a Tesla. Don't allow appointments if you can't work on a specific vehicle.</Review>

<Text>DO NOT GO HERE! Well, unless you want to be charged twice, receive bad service, get talked down too, and receive bad products. Specifically from the boy up front, Juan.

I went here on a limb, I don't usually go here. I was told I needed more done than I did, and after everything was done, they tried to charge me twice for the parts. I had to find the error. Then after two weeks the product began to rust, I called in, and they told me they would replace it for free (Sounds great right). I made an appointment. When I got there they didn't have my part, and then told me they wouldn't do the service. Then continued to be a smart aleck to me, and talk to me like he was a teenager. I will not be going back here, and will never recommend this place.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Review>Totally disagree with Carle.  Broke down on my way back from vacation on a Sunday, everyone else closed.  Michael was awesome did everything he could. BMW on the otherhand not so great in their response.....
****Update*****. So on the inside of the lift up rear hatch on the X1 there was a BMW Roadside Assistance sticker that said...Need Help? Call BMW 1800 blah blah.... so we figured what the hell we called a lady answered and within 15 minutes BMW had sent a flatbed truck trailer and ordered us an Uber yes that's right I said an Uber to take us from San Martin to Redwood City(about 50 miles). Approximately a half hour later the guy from Firestone called us and told us the flatbed had picked up our car and was driving it to our local dealer in San Mateo.  BMW did really step up in this situation. The guys at Firestone were great. They watched after the car, they called us as soon as it got picked up, I couldn't ask for more.<//Review><username>Buddy Shoe</username>< GmapID>

<Review>I went in to the Firestone service center listed above to have a front end alignment done on my '02 Blazer 2WD on the 15th of this month, May under the lifetime warranty program. After an hour I was told they didn't have the necessary shims available to do the job; I would have to come back. So, I call early on the 17th, to see if the shims had been delivered. I was told yes, and set up an appt. for that day at 1pm. Upon arrival, I'm told I owe $45 (I pay for additional parts) for the shims and an additional $80 ($40 x 2hrs., it took just under an hour) for labor to install those shims. Why should I owe an additional labor charge to complete an alignment that is supposedly being done under warranty, when the installation of the shims is part of the process of alignment? I don't know if this is corporate policy or just this particular shop trying to make extra money, but I will never go back to that shop and more than likely, no other Firestone. Period. The whole experience leaves me feeling like this shop practices legalized piracy.</Review>< pictures>

Quoted 90$/ per tire for two tires, asked them to check a noise in the front.  They were "unable to replicate the noise" - wasted diagnostic fee, oh well, should have gone to the dealer.

Throw in garbage fees, mount, balance, disposal, etc - came to 350.00/2 tires
A big difference from 90/ tire to 175/tire

Will never use again -should have used Pasillas!<//Text>

<Review>The gym itself is nice. Nice people. Not a meat market if you know what I mean. No water related classes, no pool. Older and young folks go there. Parking lot needs some work, large potholes.< /Review>< Time>

<text>It's a great gym for the cheap monthly membership rate. If you want a 5 Star Elite experience go to a private club and pay $120 dollars a month. Problem solved.< /text>< user_id>

The only issue I personally think with this gym is that it is not open 24/7. I guarantee you, that they will get plenty of more members in no time if they made it 24/7. Furthermore, if they did make it 24/7, they would need more employees, but I'm sure they can find people quite easily.<//Review>

Don't get me wrong i love this gym but i dont like their recent corporate changes. With the firing of one this places best trainer Isaiah is sad. Corporate made a terrible decision and i would be surprised if this location went downhill due to their decision. Maybe they should talk with members< /Review>

Employees need to be trained better to explain things, and it should be opened 24/7 everyday. Like planet fitness there open 24/7 and explain everything how it's supposed to be. This gym needs some improvements.<//Review>

<Text>Highly advise not to sign up. I tried to cancel my membership because I moved and was paying for not using the gym for 3 months. They told me I had to cancel in person and wanted to charge me for another month in the future because I needed to give 30 days notice. Will not be signing back up or recommending to others</Text>< Pics>

<text>I went on a Sunday when it's usually slow. I liked that they had more equipment than other fit republics. I didn't like how there were paper towels left on some of the machines. It was slow so somebody could have cleaned. One of my favorite machines would be the "Jacobs ladder" if you want a full body. One of the rowing machines was broken as in missing a peice from machine. The attendant was nowhere to be found when going to front desk.< /text>< Pictures>

I saw a previous review here which mentioned that this company makes it difficult to cancel membership. I left Sacramento a year ago, I sent an email, a letter and made a phone call to cancel. I am still paying for the membership. The latest excuse is that they can't find a record of my membership, despite the fact that I am paying each month. Truly a mistake signing up with these grifters.<//Review>

<text>I'm giving "fitness evolution" that is NOW named "Fit Republic" a 1 star because ever since they changed their name; They have changed membership plans, gym hours & took out some gym equipment! My problem is with "Liz" the Manager, she was rude & unconcerned w/ my questions about the change in membership. So we decided to cancel our membership after coming to this gym for 3 yrs!! They don't care about you or your concerns, Just your Money! I will NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS GYM TO ANYONE!</text>< pictures>

<review>The gym is quite empty, which is great. They have great equipments and machines, but they lack maintenance. The bathrooms are dirty, usually out of order. The urinals are dirty and needs scrubbing. There's always one shower working and the other broken. They are usually out of hand soap or body wash. Sometimes they dont restock sanitation stations so people just go on their way using equipments and leaving them full of sweat. Overall, if they can maintain refills and cleaning up the gym a bit more it would be a 5 star.<//review>< rate>

Weights are a bit old. It's cheap to join but a bit on the rougher side. No one is going to steal your stuff, but people are rougher.</text>

I have been inside and have spoken with the company serval times via phone and they can not get the billing correct.  This is unacceptable and a horrible incovenince for me.  I love the gym and the rate.  But they have charged me late fees for things that were not my errors and the best they could do was give me a 25% discount on the fees that should have never accumulated.  Just an all around nightmare.</review>

Really starting to hate this spot now. Started off well when opened and had a friendly staff, but they're going downhill now. They've been cutting down hours its open, they cut out child care, there aren't any mats to use on the floor and they won't even let you use the 50 they have for the class. Staff was dumbfounded when they tried to explain these changes. Go to Gold's Gym, In-Shape, 24 Hour or CA Family Fitness. Never had any issues there. Building always stinks. You get what you pay for here. Weights and equipment is the only thing solid here.< /Text>

< Review>
FIT REPUBIC EAST SAC 7870 Florin Rd Where do I begin, First I giving this review a 1 star. Not because this gym sucks! It's actually a great gym, The Staff and the people working out are great! Here's why I gave it a 1 star, When I gym this gym on December 21, 2017, It was due to health reasons. I had just return from my Doctor after having issue's with my blood pressure. At the time my blood pressure was 171/100. I really needed to spring into action and find a gym worth working out. The first day I joined the EVOFIT class. I meet my trainer Isaiah, and explained my situation with my blood pressure. I always thought having a trainer was like military boot camp DO or DIE approve! But that wasn't Isaiah approach, he allowed me to work at my own pace, With me and my age (45). I really appreciated it, I started working out 3 days a week, Monday, Wednesday afternoons and Friday mornings and sometimes on social media Friday afternoon's. Then I went from 3 days to 5 days a week. Working with Isaiah, Raina and Edwin. So here is why I gave this review 1 star ISAIAH is not longer working there, the company let him go. With all the workout and challenges Iv'e lost 12lbs, gain some muscle and i went to see my doctor Thursday May 3rd and my blood pressure was 128/78 Awesome! So who do a company get rid of a well respected by his peers be let go. So until then I will be taking my services else where. EVOFIT Corporate was wrong to Fired Isaiah!</Review>

<text>The hidden charges they do not tell you about. You think you are paying for just a membership but they tack on another fifty and charge your back account without warning. I made sure when I signed there would be no more charges, just the initial fee and membership dues. But one month later, bam! Once a year charge that they sneak in on you. Bad management is to blame. Employees should be trained better to explain what your getting into. Very disappointed.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Havent started yet. But im fully signed up with the personal trainer and kids club day care. Went inside checked it out and everything was the real deal. Wish they had a basketball court  thatll be pretty cool. Giving gym a 5 star based on customer service 💯✔ props to Dustin, very knowledgeable. Will be writing another review about the gym and my personal training experience.</text>

Nice gym with a lot of equipment for a very low price, but the gym could use some renovation, especially the locker rooms. If you pay for 18 months in advance, you can lower the cost substantially There are crossfit classes called "Evo Fiit" that you can take, but the membership is much more expensive.<//Review>

Very Basic Gym. No Steam No Sauna No Basketball Gym. Its annoying that they lock up all kettle bells, plyo stands and rubber weights for "personal training" They Used to have a real nice multi workout stand that had pullup bars, heavy bag, dip bars, weight ball tramp, They Ripped it out and replaced it with Nothing. And Im sorry I understand since its a cheap gym you cant keep it open 24/7 but closing at 9 on Fri and 7 on Sat and Sun is unacceptable. The staff is friendly. One word comes to mind when I think of this gym....Basic<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>I applied and completed paperwork on January 26, 2021 I was qualified for an interest rate at 2.275%. It took 6 months for the processor to approve it. They stated it was because they only had 1 processor with over 30 applications to complete. After all was said and done the interest rate went up and closing cost increased by $1000 more than originally promised. Ended up canceling my refi with them. Most incompetent company and biggest thieves I've ever come across. I truly wonder how they've rate so high?!?! Make sure to do the math to ensure you're not losing your principle or equity before refinancing with this mortgage lender. They aren't looking to save you money, instead they are reaching into your pockets to take what belongs to you!!!!

ADDED NOTE: In response to their explanation. It was not a lien, it was a grant which was already applied to the purchase and closing to my original loan. No one was out any $. I still reside in the home. If this had been explained and communicated to me, I would have spared myself the aggravation and wasted time. Your company strung me along giving me the impression that the processor had applications ahead of me. I was not aware that there was any disapproval of any kind on the housing grant side of what you state is the "Third Party's" fault. Poor communication on the side of Secure One wouldn't you agree?!?!</review>< pics>

{'time': 1625009130085, 'text': 'Dear Ms. Ascnecio:\n\nThank you for taking the time to share about your experience with Secure One Capital.\n\nWhen I first read your review above, I was mad.  Then I started digging and I read through the conversation log.  Here is what I found.\n\nAlthough it is noted that you were frustrated with the process, we (along with you) have been waiting for a subordination agreement from a lienholder on your property.  (An Arizona State Agency)\n\nOn Thursday, February 04, we asked if the subordinate lien on your property would be paid off or re-subordinated.  Information and authorization for a re-subordination agreement were requested on Tuesday, February 09.\n\nDue to this complication, your file\'s status was changed from Fast Track to pending a subordination agreement.\n\nI am unsure what caused the delay, but the subordination authorization was received and sent on April 05, 2021.\n\nOn April 19, we were advised, by the lender of record, that the lien was with Arizona Housing.\n\nOn April 28, it appears that we received all of the documents needed to request a subordination from Arizona Housing and the request was submitted.\n\nArizona Housing informed us on May 13, that your re-subordination request was 30th in line.\n\nOn May 28, our customer service manager jumped in to investigate the status of your file.  It appears that the banker, the processor, and the processing manager were working to keep your file up to date and ready to move to underwrite once the re-subordination agreement was received.  (The file cannot be underwritten without the subordination agreement.)\n\nIn early June, there are a lot of notes about updating documentation preparing the file for submission.\n\nOn June 16, Arizona Housing declined the subordination request.  Your processor attempted to re-work your loan to re-submit to Arizona Housing on June 24.\n\nBased on the documented Conversation Log in the file, it appears that much of the time was spent waiting either on re-subordination documentation or re-subordination approval, which never came.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the numbers to change when trying to re-work a loan to meet the requirements of a subordination agreement.  In order to avoid this, we typically recommend that clients pay off the lien.  Especially since COVID-19, when obtaining these agreements has become a long-term waiting game.\n\nI did read a note in the conversation log entered by your banker which indicated a decision to re-subordinate vs payoff.   I don\'t know if proper expectations were set at that time, but it has become a tedious process.\n\nI don\'t understand the "incompetent" and "thieves" references in your review.\n\nI am sorry for the delays caused by third-party agencies and the outcome of your application but based on everything in your loan file it seems that, like you, we were waiting on others to perform.\n\nYou may reach out to me directly at BillR@SecureOneCapital.com.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBill Robertson\nPublic Relations Manager'}< /response>

Austin made the process extremely smooth and efficient. I felt like he was working to get the best deal for me in the most convenient time for me. I have a crazy work schedule which required me to do things and need answers at odd times. It was highly valuable to be able to get answers and get things taken care of on my schedule. Overall great experience and would recommend Austin to friends.<//Text>

THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I wish there was possibility to give less than 1 star. We started working with them and got a loan estimate in Dec 2020, did appraisal by Jan 15 2021 and then there was complete silence. I kept calling and emailing the loan officer and every-time I got email saying they are working on it, company is being slow but things are going on. I kept emailing every week after the 6 weeks time that was told to me that it would take to close the loan. Then I decided to start calling the head office. At head office, I was told every-time someone will get back to me the same day and then no one would get back to me that day. It was after more than 2 weeks of calling every day that finally Erin got back to me and said how loan officer (Dillon) made mistakes and now my estimate is no longer valid. She said someone else will work on my loan and let me know if something can be done, no one ever  got back to me. She finally shared the appraisal we paid for after asking for that for so many days. She also said they will offer me a visa card to excuse for my time and money they wasted and to no surprise, I never received gift card either. Please be aware and do not work with this company. I have done a few refinances now and have never had such a bad experience.<//text>

Secure One Capitol helped make my refinancing experience less stressful and hassle free. I worked with Austin Beck and I was very impressed by the way he kept me informed of every step in the refinancing process.  When ever I had a concern or question he always responded quickly,  either by an email or call. It was very refreshing to have someone who would return my inquiries immediately and not make me wait a week.<//text>

Austin bent over backwards to help me through this! He promptly answered my texts, calls and/or emails.. even on the weekends! When I was worried he would always reassure me. If one thing didn't work he quickly came up with another solution. His personality and determination to help me never stopped. Wonderful experience! I have recommended his services to all of my school friends and my family! Thank you so much Austin!!
He and Antony work well together.. they were warm and extremely professional throughout the transaction!  Again.. I thank you both from the bottom of my heart ❤️<//Text>

This is the second time that we refinanced with Secure One. Our previous experience was beyond what we expected, hence going with the company a second time. To our surprise, this was probably the smoothest and seamless process that we have ever done. Austin Beck and Anthony Perez were my main points of contact. Both incredible to work with. The entire process took less than a month and a half. Due to covid we expected this to drag on like everything else in life. Again, the process and coordination between Austin and Anthony kept us informed and confident that the process was always running smoothly. I would strongly recommend Secure One.< /Text>

The information they share are very detailed and helps customers to make a decision on the spot. The team overall is great to work with right from first phone call till the money is funded.

I usually don't respond to mailers, but I decided to give this one a shot given the state of the market. I was surprised to get a response back within minutes from their representative Anthony who placed me in direct cell phone contact with my residential banking advisor Austin. He was more than courteous and professional, but made himself available to me early mornings, late nights, weekends, and any other times I had a question. No matter how simple or complex the inquiry, Austin provided me with a prompt response and in the end gave us a very competitive loan and we were able to close within a month! Moreover, the new rate should save us tens of thousands of dollars over the loan period. We are very satisfied and it is very refreshing to know there are loan advisors like Austin who actually listen to your needs and concerns and advise in an honest manner.</text>

Their whole process was very straight forward and Anthony Perez & Austin Beck were able to guide me through the process and made it all make sense and the process was quicker than I ever thought possible!
My wife and I had such a good experience with Secure One Capital that we are now thinking of re-financing our second home though them!<//Review>< Rate>

Received a generic letter in the mail, and decided to give them a try. From a search I conducted, they were they offered the best deal, so I went with them. It was an extremely difficult experience, as they were not responsive, asked for the same information numerous times. The process took over four months because they kept making mistakes. However all that doesn't matter now that my loan is shorter and I'm paying less a month.<//review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Austin Beck and Anthony Perez were amazing. I was refinancing my mortgage as well as borrowing cash for a home renovation on top of that. I know that refinancing a loan can be an excruciating process, and that borrowing cash is just an added complication, but they made the process as easy as possible. They were always available to take questions, and consistently checked in with me about the progress. I saw the opportunity to refinance about a week before construction started on my home. When I decided to go through the process, I told Austin that I needed the cash as soon as possible because I needed to pay my contractor. The amount of attentiveness and the quickness with which this was all done blew me away. I wholeheartedly recommend working with them for any financing needs.<//Review>< username>

<text>I couldn't be more pleased with the service I received from Secure One Capitol regarding refinancing my home. I dealt with Erik Nelson from start to finish and he was extremely helpful and informative through every step. It is a new experience doing everything online now but it was a great experience. Towards the end Erik set me up with Gardenia Astudillo who buttoned up all of the paperwork and kept everything moving smoothly. I would strongly recommend this company and deffinately these two amazing people. They made a huge change in my family's financial future and I know they could help anyone looking to make life easier with a refinance or mortgage.  Thanks for everything.

<text>Secure One Capital lives up to its name: Secure
From our first interaction with Gilberto Orozco of Secure One Capital it was clear that he had our best interests at heart, and would be there for us through the entire refinancing process. We were sold on him from the moment he offered a cell phone number to reach him, and he was always willing to answer that phone when we had questions.  His professionalism, honesty, and spirit made the entire process simple and stress-free, which made this a very pleasant experience for us.  The virtual process that Secure One Capital has established gave us confidence that our personal information would remain secure, and made the application and document upload processes easy.  They arranged for a notary to come to us for closing, respecting our requests for social distancing without question. We highly recommend Secure One Capital, especially Gilberto Orozco, as you can trust them to make your refinancing experience painless and secure.</text><date>1613844047041< /date>< pictures>

I would like to thank Austin Beck for his professionalism, knowledge and communication on making my refinance a big success. Austin was instrumental in making my refinance go smoothly and pain free. Whenever I needed to ask any questions he always responded back quickly and efficiently to my text or emails. Austin communication and step-by-step process ensured my refinance was a success in about 35 days. My refinance loan was an excellent choice. Also Kim Murohl did an outstanding job when it came time to close my loan. I would recommend to anyone who wants to purchase or refinance a home to give Secure One Capital a chance you want regret it.

I refinanced with Secure One Capital about 1 year ago and everything went smoothly. Now that the interest rates are lower, I wanted to take advantage of it and refinance again. I just wanted a simple refinance.  They were offering a 3.25 interest rate!  Higher then what I have now! Before I knew what was going on, they said I should take cash out and an appraiser was calling to schedule an appointment.  I ended up paying for the appraiser, I had an appraisal done a year ago!  Then they told me they could not refinance my loan.  I had other salesmen from that company calling me asking if I want to refinance, and people asking me for documents I did not need or had given to them before.  Nobody was on the same page.  It was a horrible experience that cost me $600 for a useless appraisal.  This went on for about 3 months.  I finally called Rocket Mortgage and in 3 weeks, I am refinancing for a 2.25 interest rate.<//Text>

I just completed a refinance of my home through Secure One Capital handled by Austin Beck, Residential Banking Advisor. I highly recommend Mr. Beck. He was very knowledgeable, explained everything in easily understandable language. He was extremely professional, easy to contact and replied to all my queries quickly. He made the whole process run smoothly from start to finish. If you’re thinking of refinancing you will be in good hands with Austin Beck and Secure One Capital.< /review>

<Review>Excellent service!
Austin Beck was exceptional!

I recently got my home refinanced with Secure One Capital. I was referred by a close friend of mine to get some information on refinancing my condo. By the time I hung up the phone conversation with Austin, I found myself emailing all necessary documents to him to begin the process of refinancing with Secure One Capital! Since then, the process was flawless.  Austin was knowledgeable, professional and honest. Whenever I asked him questions by phone, emails or text, his responses were very prompt and satisfactory. I was informed very clearly in every steps moving forward including home appraisal, notaries and contacting the management company and insurance company for my condo.
I must say my experience working with Austin in the Secure One Capital was excellent! I will definitely recommend Austin and his team to my friends and family!<//Review>< name>

<Review>Sam was professional, polite, and efficient all at the same time.  (Rare combination).  His knowledge of the process was comprehensive and his ability to "translate" my needs in layman's terms to the industry standard was exceptional.  The documentation requirements for closing was rather extensive, but Sam was clear in his requests and we closed pretty quickly.  Online review and signing software was helpful as well.<//Review>< GmapID>

With rates at historically low levels, a refinance certainly made sense.  The old-fashioned face-to-face loan application process is not possible these days, so we trust in phone and e-mail conversations.  My dealings with Bruce Edgell and his team (Matt Oliver and Elizabeth Galaviz-Gomez) were efficient and professional.  My transaction was not traditional and required some patience to complete it - but they handled the process and closed the deal - everything as promised.  I appreciate their professionalism and thoroughness from the first conversation through closing and would do business with them again - if rates happen to come down again.<//review>

<review>I received a letter in the mail from Secure One Capital about refinancing the loan on my property. I had never refinanced anything before but felt that I should take advantage of the extremely low interest rates. I called the number and was connected with a "Nicole Hill", who I briefly spoke to about the refinancing process. I was assigned to worked with her assistant Moe Suri, who was absolutely amazing! I had a ton of questions as it was my first time through a refinancing process. Moe was constantly patient and more importantly available to answer any and all questions that I had. He kept me up to date on status, where we were in the refinancing process and the next steps. I can honestly say that if it were not for Moe, I probably would have searched for a new lender to refinance under. I had a difficult time reaching Janene Spargur, who was the senior processor assigned to my account. At one point, I had attempted to contact Janene several times regarding some crucial information on my loan. I was never called back. Moe was the saving grace. I could call or text him day or night and he was ALWAYS there to assist me. I cannot say enough good things about Moe Suri. If it were not for Moe's professionalism and open willingness to assist me through, what I thought was an extremely stressful process, I probably would not have closed / finalized my refinancing with Secure One Capital. Way to go Moe! And thank you for all the help and assistance you provided throughout my refinancing.<//review>< pictures>

I will say I was a bit skeptical at first to deal with someone from the left coast being that I am on the right "East" coast and essentially all over email, text and phone calls with one visit from the Notary

I really didn't feel like I needed to refinance however when I spoke with Anthony about the potential rates which were later verified by Austin, and the simplicity of the process, I was all in.

I did a little research into the company and they are legit. With most of the signing over email (DocuSign) and final process with a notary sent to my home all scheduled by Secure One.

About a month later I dropped my rate from 3.5% to 1.875%. Imagine that, less than 2% and payments were about the same monthly. I converted my remaining 22 years to a 15 year mortgage with payments about the same as before.

Totally recommend these two guys and SecureOne.

Good Luck Austin

<text>This is the second refinance that we have done with Secure One Capital and both times, the process was smooth and the customer service was great. Austin Beck and Anthony Perez were the last residential banking advisor that we used for our VA Refinance, and he was professional all through the process.  We would certainly recommend this company if you are looking for a refinance.<//text></record>

Everyone that I came in contact with from Secure One were very professional. Austin Beck “held my hand” through the entire process. I told him that I was tech challenged & that my late husband did everything for me & now being alone and through this pandemic—very alone, I got scared & stressed at times - but Austin would walk me through it.I guess it even closed in record time thanks to Austin & Anthony. It’s been a pleasure working with you.</text>

My experience with secure One capital was awesome. Austin Beck did a great job handling our refinance. He had always been there to answer all our questions. Austin also played a huge part in getting our refinance done in less than 2 months. I would definitely recommend  Austin Beck and his staff to everyone seeking to get a refinance with secure One capital.
We were very satisfied with the out come. Thank you Austin Beck< /text>

I was pleasantly surprised. As with anything like this, you go in skeptical - how much is fact, how good will the service be, and even a hint of 'is this really a scam'?  Rick Albrecht and his team were awesome. They were SO easy to work with. They proactively kept me informed every step along the way (I never needed to follow). Rick was thorough, transparent, proactive, and to me felt genuine - I never felt he was selling me on something. After all was done, I got exactly what he said was going to be done. I cant think of a better combination.</Review>

I had the pleasure of working with Daniel Ortega from Secure One Capital.  Daniel quickly earned the nickname the hardest working man in finance from me.  It's does not mater the time of day or the day of the week, Daniel was always there for me throughout the whole refinance process.  Daniel very knowledgeable and personable which made the refinance process less painful.  I have never met Daniel in person, however I  now consider him a friend. Talk to Daniel he will take good care of you.</Text>

<review>I recently refinanced my mortgage with Secure One Capital Corporation. At first, I was reluctant to use a company I hadn't already heard of or had experience with.  After speaking with Austin Beck, I felt secure and comfortable.  Austin was amazing!  Each call, email, and text was quickly and efficiently answered.  He made the usually stressful process of refinancing so easy and painless.  I recommend using this company to refinance to everyone I know.  Specifically, I recommend working with Austin Beck to ensure professional customer service.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdedf7d9cc823:0x1cee113b397bf633<//Gmap_id>< userid>

I would like to thank Austin Beck and his team at Secure Capital One for making the refinance of my home a smooth and streamlined procedure.  Every step of this process from first introduction to final closing was made easy for me and I was kept abreast every step of the way of the loans progress, never once having to call Austin for a progress report.  Mr. Beck's professional manner, knowledge of his product, friendliness and people skills did not go unnoticed by me and I hope they do not go unnoticed by his own managers.<//review>

Like many home owners recently, we received numerous offers from mortgage companies offering excellent refi rates - they ALL come with the fine print on the back that you should be sure to read because in order to get that ultra low rate, you need to fulfill the criteria listed.

Secure One Capital was one of the many, including our own/current servicer to send us these offers. At a time when many of these mortgage companies are so busy, Anthony and Austin at Secure One Capital were very responsive and attentive from the first time I called in. Anthony and Austin were willing to work around our schedules to collect necessary information and discuss refinance options  - they are based out of California and we are on the east coast.

While I suspect that there would have been a few less fees to refi with our current mortgage servicer (easier keeping our mortgage in house I would guess), Austin made it so easy and walked me through every step as it needed to be done. When you’re considering a big loan, it can be a daunting and nerve wracking task to thoroughly read through mortgage documents, but if there was any question or explanation needed, Austin was quick to respond.

I appreciated the ability to communicate via phone/email/text. It made the forwarding of documents very easy. There was also an option to upload documents online for those who prefer a more secure method.

My time is valuable and I appreciated Austin’s efficiency - he knew what to ask us for before it was needed for our files. Any letters that needed to be written to clarify information in our file were drafted almost immediately and available for us to sign and return.

The actually signing of the mortgage was still the same lengthy paperwork to move through, an unavoidable inconvenience for refi, but a local notary signing agent came to the house to walk us through it. Austin was available during that time when a question came up in the paperwork and he promptly addressed it.

Of course Secure One Capital wants your business, but Anthony and Austin are people you want to do business with, explaining every part of the process so thoroughly, making it so easy and efficient from start to finish. I’m very pleased with our decision to work with them, and will call them in the future with any questions or concerns I may have.

If you’re looking for excellent service, Austin and Anthony are your guys!<//review>

<Date>1616186415954<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>I just refinanced through Secure One Capital.   I would give them the highest rating of any refinance organization I have dealt with over the years, since refinancing from the early 2000’s.   The time frame that began the refinancing was early December, 2020 when home mortgage rates were approaching their bottom, in the mid to lower 2% range.
My initial contact with them was simply via a flyer in the mail, recommending I consider refinancing.  Ordinarily I would ignore such mail, since it was obviously from a mailing list and they were out of Costa Mesa, CA (I am in Houston, TX), but in my case I had begun the consideration of refinancing and my present mortgager did not initiate new mortgages.     So I decided to give them a call just to see current rates.
A gentleman named Moe Suri answered the phone and he gave me the information I requested.  As I only refinance every 10 years or so, and he does this for a living, he was able to answer all my questions in quite a professional manner, and was able to anticipate my questions.   He talked about the BBB rating of Secure One Capital (among the highest) and suggested I check out their references.
I did check the references and also checked out the rates he suggested were available.  He also told me I could proceed with the application with no up-front money.
I decided to proceed, figuring nothing to lose except revealing some financial information.  I made sure all my financial information came from my secure dropbox folder which only he had access to, and all the information went to his email address at Secure One Capital.
To make a long story short, The process in refinancing was the most professional of any I have been involved with and, working with Moe Suri and his boss Nicole Hill (Executive Mortgage Banker), they were able to secure for me the rate that I had decided was a “no brainer” to proceed.  Now I recognize he were able to do so due to the market conditions at the time, but still, I felt he and Nicole were particularly diligent in making sure I did lock in that rate, and then were attentive to guiding the loan approval process to successful conclusion.  The process began in mid December and I closed in early February.  Their communication with me during the process was excellent, in most cases same day responses.
For the above reasons, I would rate that organization and the two people I dealt with as the highest in my experience.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Arren and I have worked on this difficult refi for quite some time.
With the help of Megan we have finally got it to the end line.
Without there tiring efforts it probably wouldn't have happened, but they stuck by me and got it done. I thank them and would recommend anyone to contact them if you need to refi your home loan.

Working with Adam was a great experience. I was working with another lender then i received a letter in the mail from Adam and Secure One Capital.   His rate was half a percent less and cost were so much less! I was already 2 weeks into the process with the other lender (they said it would take 8 weeks to close) and Adam told me he can get the loan done in under 30 days. I didn't need an apprasial and he delivered on everything he promised and we closed in less than a month. Thanks for being such a great help in this typically hard and strenuous process. You Rock Adam!< /review>

It turned out to be Secure One Capital and they clarified that point immediately.  My current mortgage company didn't want to give me a better deal so I took a change. I worked with Austin Beck to consolidate two loans two one with a better rate.  I was presented with all the numbers.  It was presented accurately but very optimistically so do all the math yourself and compute your APR and see if it make sense to incur cost for a refi.  For example, getting back escrow is not a benefit as you still need it on the new loan. For us it made total sense as we moved two loans to a rental property where we can expense interest and the expense of the loan, and get a better rate. Anyway, Austin entertained all our questions and was overall great to work with. Because or property value to loan amount was good, we didn't need an appraisal and that saved a good chunk.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Austin Beck and Anthony Perez were instrumental in making sure this was our easiest refinance ever! Even through COVID, they got us closed quickly and made it as painless as possible. We did two loans simultaneously (primary and rental) and thought it would be a headache but they were able to get them closed at the same time!

Austin and his assistant were in constant contact and we were never left wondering what the status of our loan was. They were professional, honest, and informative. We had tons of questions (tons!) but he happily answered all of them.

Refinancing can be a daunting process but with their help, they made this one of the least stressful refinances I’ve ever went through. If you’re looking to take advantage of these rates, I highly recommend Secure One! I’ve already told my friends and family and two more are in the process with him!

Thank you Austin and Secure One Capital!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcdedf7d9cc823:0x1cee113b397bf633< /gmapID></record>

Being a first time home buyer, I knew nothing of the process, except how stressful it could be.  From the first phone call,  James made the process simple and easy for me to understand. Each step of the way I was kept well informed and any questions that came up were immediately answered. With the exemplary customer service I was given, and the fact that SecureOne was less expensive than any of the other companies I researched, I can say without a doubt that I will be using James and the SecureOne Team for all my financial needs moving forward. I highly recommend you do the same.<//Review>

Just wanted to say working with Austin Beck at Secure One is a breath of fresh air! This guy is knowledgeable, professional, honest and respectful. Every phone call was a delete, every email was timely and every text was handled quickly and responsible. I praise Security for their initiative in selecting him to be a member of the team. They found themselves a gem. If you need help with your mortgage call and ask for Austin Beck today.< /Review>

Ours was a very complicated file as we were refinancing not only our primary residence, but a cash out refi for an investment property as well. He kept the process moving and was excellent at keeping communication open. He worked on weekends and did whatever it took to overcome any potential roadblocks. I feel like we got excellent interest rates and terms. I would highly recommend Secure One Capital Corporation  to anyone considering mortgage financing.<//Text>< Pictures>

Fadi Malkosh is a refinance stud muffin.  He did what other said they would do but didn’t... I got stuck on a remodel of my house.. basically done but the floors needed to be placed.  Others said they couldn’t do the appraisal... after over a year of trying ... I found Fadi and he made it happen... and the appraiser wasn’t even concerned ... since most of my house was finished. That was about 7-8 months ago... the refi boosted my credit scores, I got out of an FHA loan (no more pmi), and  I finished my project. We just refi’d again to grab a 2.3% rate due to my improved scores.  I’m sitting pretty now.   Fadi won’t refi just to refi... if it doesn’t make sense, he won’t do it.  I highly recommend!!!!<//review>

We have just completed refinancing our home. Over the years, we have completed this process 4 or 5 times. Gilbert Orozco with Secure One Capital has made the process of buying a home simple. Gilbert kept us informed each step of the way. He is knowledgeable and efficient but also personable. It’s been a pleasure.< /review>

Austin Beck and his team were just AMAZING! Great communication through the whole process. Great service - even had a notary come to my house on a holiday to sign documents!  Entire process complete in about 30 days. Would definitely use again and recommend to my friends and family.</review>

Do not use this company! There were so many good reviews that it seemed fine . Starting to question if  the good reviews are legit . Communication is difficult once they closed the deal . They messed up BIG on issuing payoff checks to accounts that were already paid off  . Escrow has closed and cannot get closure on over $2000 dollars on mysterious checks  .  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY !<//text>

We have been buying, selling, and refinancing our homes for about 50 years now.  Mr. Orozco provided us with the most efficient and tension-free experience of those 50 years.  I strongly recommend SecureOne Capital’s team and their foremost banker - Gilbert Orozco..  I have alerted my friends.< /review>< UserId.>

Kudos to Austin Beck and Anthony Perez for an excellent job on the VA refinance mortgage.  Not only was the interest reduction a better deal, but also the reduction in the monthly mortgage payment.  The two gentlemen regularly and frequently communicated with me using applicable platforms of communication.  We closed in less than 30 days.  As a retired US Combat Veteran with service-connected disabilities, Austin and Anthony knows what it takes to make positive deliverables.  Thanks to Secure One Capital.</Text>

Austin was very attentive, knowledgeble and in constant contact for what was needed from me. My only reason for not giving five stars to Secure One was the fact I did not get the lowest rate which I believe I deserved with  my credit rating. This of course had no bearing on Austin's five star performance!<//Review>< Pictures>

Austin Beck was extremely helpful and patient with us when it came to the refinancing process. We were new to the process and he took the time to help us understand and guide us to the right decision for us. He was fast to respond when needed which was really important to us when having busy schedules. He was very knowledgeable when it came to the breakdown of the point system and was very fast and efficient with calculating what interest point was most beneficial to us. Very pleasant to work with, would highly recommend to anyone!< /text>

I recently received a flyer in the mail from Secure One Capital and decided to give them a call based on the rate that they were quoting for a refinance.  We live in Texas, and being that Secure One Capital's office is in California I was not sure that they could help, however, with the wonderful rate I knew I had to try.  (Texas is a tricky state for refinance! not easy, different laws/rules apply)

When I did finally talk to someone with Secure One Capital, I spoke with Jeff Janke, he immediately put me at ease as he explained that he was well versed in the Texas rules, laws, etc. with home lending! We spoke a bit on the phone and I decided to start the process that day!

Jeff was amazing.  He was attentive, patient, informed and really took the time to answer all of my questions. I asked him over the next couple of days to run many models showing me the different rates, what the numbers would be for each and the pros and cons.

Jeff not only worked with me on my questions, giving me all of the answers I could possibly use in my decision making, he gave me sound advice and helped me to look at the numbers from a perspective that I had not thought of, really giving me the confidence to make the right decision!

During the process Jeff reached out to me often to check on me and make sure I did not have any additional questions and to let me know where our loan application was, what part of the process we were in and approximate time frames and overall expectations.

We were surprised when we received a call from Jeff saying that everything went through smoothly and that we were ready to close.  The title company reached out to us and scheduled our closing on the same day!

Today at 5:30 pm we had a notary at our home with all loan docs and signing  papers for our loan.

My husband and I have purchased many homes, etc throughout our lives... and NEVER... I mean NEVER.... has anything gone so smooth, so pleasant and so EASY!

Jeff's expertise and sincere concern for our well being in this process made this such a wonderful experience.  We could not be more pleased and absolutely cannot recommend Jeff Janke and Secure One Capital enough!

I am sharing this information with everyone I know! If you need help with a home loan, sincerely do yourself a favor and call Jeff... you will be so happy you did!!!!!!

thank you again Jeff :)<//text>

I don't normally leave reviews for things, but I had to make an exception for Bruce Edgell and Blake Wilson. My husband and I used our VA loan to purchase our first home and It could not have gone more smoothly! Bruce Edgell and Blake Wilson were able to get us a 100% financed 30 year VA loan with a 2.25% interest rate! Not to mention, as first time buyers, they held our hand every step of the way, making sure we understood every piece that went along with this usually complicated process. Bruce Edgell, Blake Wilson, and Secure One Capital have earned themselves a client for life if ever the need to purchase again or refinance in the future. I have already sent my parents their way!</review>

<text>Update:  Austin Beck did it again!  I took advantage of the lower rates and refinanced a second time.  This time again as before everything was a breeze.  Austin is very easy to work; he was always very responsive when I needed him or if I had a question. Austin Beck represents Secure One efficiently and is an asset for the company and his talents should be reconsidered for a higher position.  From day one, Austin was friendly, professional and knowleadgable and these traits never faltered. Thank you Austin and team for making my second refinance close in no time.

Secure One Capital Corporation was the right choice for me! I was lucky Austin answered the phone when I called to inquire about my intention to refinance. From Day one, Austin made me feel at ease. He was professional at all times, knowledgeable, patient, and never mislead or misrepresented any information. He was proactive, attentive to my needs, answered questions intelligently without hesitation, and kept me informed as the loan steps progressed. My instincts were right to trust him from the start. I highly recommend Austin; he is an effective communicator and a pleasure to work with! I have already referred Austin to others.</text>< pics>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!

I received a mailer from Secure One showing a promising rate for a refi, so I bit at the chance of saving some money.  I started the process in early March.  They were very responsive and willing in the beginning to gather all of my information.  After our initial discussions, their response time dropped from daily responses to taking 3-5 days to respond to an email or phone call.  At this point, I figured it was a fraudulent operation and they managed to just collect all of my personal information for identity theft.  However, after nearly 2 months (during which I sent numerous follow-up emails), I was finally informed the loan was close to closing, and I received the final closing disclosure, thinking the end was in sight!   But then earlier this week, I was told my loan was not going to be processed because the lock they made at the beginning was "improperly" entered into their system, and since current rates are much higher than the locked rate, their investors would not accept the loan at this rate.  What's the point of a lock if they don't hold it!?  Not only are these ethics despicable, but probably illegal based upon the loan estimate and loan disclosure showing these promised rates.  And because I chose to go with Secure One, I missed out on a low rate with a reputable company.  Don't even consider going with them.  Use a real company that you can trust.< /review>

We refinanced three homes with this company.  After a great experience with the first home, I recommended the company to my mother.  She started the process with one gentleman who left the company and then another lady named Ana came into the situation.  They quoted my mother one thing and then sent her paperwork with something else which she caught and asked them to fix.  At this point, she had already spent hours gathering and sending in the crazy number of documents required for any mortgage loan.  They began ignoring her phone calls until I told a gentleman with the company that I would not do the other two deals with them unless they called her back because I did not want to give my business to someone that would treat her that way.   They finally called her and still wouldn’t honor the original terms they agreed to, but she agreed to compromise and still go through with the loan.  In the meantime, we closed our other two deals with them only to find out that they never funded her loan even after closing(making her late on her mortgage payment when she has PERFECT credit).  I truly believe that they never intended to fund her loan and only went through closing to appease me and ensure our other two deals closed.

The thing I find disgusting about this is that my mother is an essential worker that has been extremely busy during this pandemic and they first ignored her, lied to her, and then wasted her very valuable time with a closing I believe they never intended to fund.  I am truly embarrassed to have recommended this company to her and saddened that my mother was treated this way.  If there was a problem with the original quote, a little bit of honesty would have gone a LONG way with her.  She would never treat someone that way and I am truly appalled that this company couldn’t admit to their mistake rather than waste such a substantial amount of her time!

I will never recommend this company to anyone again.< /text>

I worked with Austin Beck and Anthony Perez on our refinance. I was a bit apprehensive about how it would go with SecureOne capital since I had not worked with them before. But the entire process went smoothly. Both Austin and Anthony were on top of it the whole time. Communication was clear and on-time. Considering such a high demand for refi around this time, I was really surprised about how well they responded to all my requests! Happy to recommend SecureOne capital and their team for doing an excellent job. Would definitely go back to them for any future needs.< /review>

<Text>Austin Beck was extremely helpful in the refinancing process. As a first time home buyer, Austin used efficient communication skills and a wealth of professional knowledge to make the process not only expeditious, but educational as well. Austin has my utmost recommendation to anyone looking to engage in the loan servicing process.<//Text></record>

Secure One Capital provided the best service and the best interest rate/fees of any mortgage or refinance provider. They were also professional, courteous, and efficient. Their online software (for uploading documents) was secure and easy to use. All of my questions were answered promptly and they provided exactly the product I was looking for. Couldn’t have been better. Great job. - Jessica Moore< /review>

I just finished refinancing my home loan with Secure One Capital. Austin Beck and his team were very easy to work with, kept us well informed throughout the process, and got my wife and me a great rate! This was the second time we have worked with Secure One and would definitely recommend them and Austin Beck to anyone!< /review>

<review>Refinancing my mortgage with Secure One Capital was a very smooth easy, and time saving process . Working with Brandon LUU and Rick Albrecht was a real pleasure as they made the electronic process so easy to use and they are both very professional, efficient , and knowledgeable.  I would strongly recommend  them for any mortgage applicant.

Just completed my refinance with Adam Afghani and it was the best choice i ever made! He dropped my rate to 2.75% and saved me over $400 per month. He also set my loan up so i was able to hold onto my June and July mortgage payment. I was about to go into forbearance with my current company and thank the lord i spoke to Adam before going through with it. He explained everything to me and delivered 100% of what he said during the application. Adam and his assistant Chris are my hero's! Thank you both so much!!<//text>

I must say that Christian Porter and Secure One Capital are the best!  We've done two re-fi's that went very quickly, with zero hitches.  Christian is super-responsive, straight forward, and cares about his clients.  He goes the extra distance to ensure that the process goes smoothly and even quicker than we had anticipated.  He exceeded our expectations and we will definitely contact him again for any home financing needs.  Most highly recommended and we could not be happier or more satisfied!!!  Ron H.</Review>

I began this journey 140 days ago after speaking With Jordan Cano from Secure One Capital Corp.(SOCC).  After an exhausting 4+ months the team, led by Rich Albrecht, led me through a myriad of requests that had to be met to secure the loan.

I own a small business and discovered just how tough securing this loan became.  Tax information, all sources of income, certain legal issues (which were mine) and more had to be submitted...and re submitted and, frankly, I just about gave up on the whole idea.

Kudos to Rick and his team for not giving up on me as they knew how important securing the loan meant to me.    So, even with excellent credit, good equity in my home and more it took what seemed like a lifetime to get this done.  So, thanks again team.<//Review>

I would like to take the opportunity to give a heartfelt thanks to Adam Albonni and his team at Secure One Capital Corp.
Adam was very knowledgeable, helpful, and straightforward in his advice in deciding the best avenue in the refinancing of my mortgage. I had shopped around and Adam really stood out in his professional yet easy-going manner. It was my deciding factor in going with him. I experienced absolutely no stress in this experience.
This is my second time doing a refi and it was so smooth I was actually "waiting for the other shoe to drop (meaning problems)". Especially when you think of how crazy the mortgage lending business is right now with the amazingly low rates, not to mention the Covid-19 issues.
My experience could not have been better!
Thank you, Adam, and your excellent team.

<text>I have refinanced a number of times over the past 20 years or so.  Some experiences were better for me than others.  Secure One Capital - and my agent, Blake Wilson, in particular - could not have been better for me.  The process was speedy, thorough, and very pleasant.  Blake listened closely to my initial questions, apprehensions and goals for my refinance and he was able to deliver on ALL of these.  It felt more like Blake was my ally and supporter throughout this process than anything else.  The other staff involved in my case were also quick, helpful, courteous and dependable.    I am amazed at how well this process went for me, how quickly I was able to get every last detail completed.................just amazing.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>My wife and I recently refinanced our VA loan with Secure One Capital.  We worked hand in hand with Mike Baker who did an outstanding job coordinating the loan process.  He stayed in touch with us every step of the way providing updates and any additional information as needed.    Everything from submitting and signing documents to closing couldn't have gone any smoother.  We were extremely satisfied with the end result.  Mike Baker and SOC come highly recommended for any of your future mortgage needs.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I have to thank him for his patience and understanding and willingness to go out of his way to make the process as painless as possible.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< review>
I would like to personally thank Abe Yang for his outstanding customer service and persistence through the entire refinance process. His professionalism and integrity was a breath of fresh air, he truly was someone I could trust. I had just been turned down by Wells Fargo due to the loan officer giving very poor advice. Abe was able to not only give me the most competitive interest  rate but was able to get my loan closed in a timely matter. I will recommend Abe to all my fiends and family moving forward. His industry knowledge and professionalism are of the highest standard.

Thank you Abraham Yang!!

Worked with Jeff Pollock to refinance my home and lower my interest rate.  Jeff was professional and easy to work with.  He responded to my questions and concerns in a timely matter.  He made the process simple.  I would recommend him to friends in looking to business with Secure One.<//text>

<review>I started a refi with Quicken/Rocket but was also checking out Brian Albonni at Secure One.  I was shocked at the difference!  Quicken charged me a $500 deposit and was going to charge me more than 2 pts for 2.875%  Brian was able to offer me 2.5% with 1 pt and no deposit.  Also no appraisal!! I must say I was suspicious at first but Brian put my suspicions to rest.
Brian is an honest, kind, caring professional who earned my business and respect.  Secure One was extremely easy to work with and delivered as promised.  Forget Quicken/Rocket, they were NOT good to work with.  I would recommend Brian Albonni and Secure One for all of your mortgage needs.</review>< Pics>

<review>Austin Beck was amazing for the whole refinance process. He was very knowledgeable about anything I asked and would respond back to my text messages/emails very promptly. I believe he even answered my phone calls on what appeared to be his day off. Couldn't have asked for a better experience than what I received from Austin.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Due to a misstep, the process took longer than I hoped for but time frame was understandable. There were a lot of steps that did seemed extra and made it more difficult than the original home loan,which is just enough to keep it from being five stars for us. That being said we are happy with the results. More impressive overall was the customer service provided by Austin Beck. He kept in constant communication and was quick to answer all my many questions in a very timely manner. We do recommend Secure One Capital.< /Review>< username>

I recently completed my refinance with Secure One Capital, and was able to shorten my mortgage from 30 years loan to 15 years at a super low rate.

These professionals helped me with a refinance of my home that was the best decision I ever made.  Along with a lower interest rate, my truck is paid off as well as my RV and all of my credit card bills.  Daniel Ortega and Lupe Garcia guided me along the process with a clear and simple plan that only took a month to accomplish.  I am retired military and on a fixed income.  Secure one Capital helped me more than I can express.  Thank you Daniel and Lupe!< /review>

I have nothing but great things to say about Secure One Capital Corporation and mostly about the help that our agent, Austin Beck gave to me.  He was professional, kind and always transparent on what I can expect next and kept me in the loop throughout the whole process.  I would highly recommend Secure One Capital Corporation to anyone looking to refinance their home loan (and hope you get as lucky to get Austin as your agent as I was!).</text>

This is my second experience with Secure One Capital, specifically AUSTIN BECK, and I can't express the professionalism and swift action to complete my refinance.

Both times AUSTIN BECK was totally prompt, polite, and professional in all aspects associated with my unique requirements.

If you're in need of the services that Secure One Capital provides, I HIGHLY recommend you contact them and ask for AUSTIN BECK.

You will be treated like family throughout the process and, I say this from experience, be truly pleased with the results.

Signed,

Best refinance or purchase I have ever processed due in part to the great rate and terms I was offered and the service Arren provided! I got a straight forward, no hassle refi analysis up front that did not change, Arren gave my exceptional support the entire process (and I am very demanding).< /review>

My husband and I decided to refinance our house.  In doing so, we first encountered Nicole Hill who began the initial process.  Her demeanor, kindness and overall knowledge was impressive.  She assisted us through the process and responded quickly.  We then were introduced to Austin Beck who completed the process.  He too was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  He stayed in touch and assisted wherever we had questions and even if we didn't he was there to help. Communication is the cornerstone of a good business.  Communication with and through Nicole Hill and Austin Beck was the best. We felt valued and consistently updated. Thank you for an awesome experience.<//text>

The first person I talk to was Daniel Ortega. It was almost like I was reuniting with a long-lost buddy. He was extremely helpful and contacted me any time that I asked and was good at following up on questions about the whole process. It was an easy process even though there was a three-hour time difference and I would most certainly recommend working with Daniel or anyone from his team on a refinance.< /Review>

I was trying to Refinance my home since Sept. 2019, but being Seniors and with limited income, and as I had more credit card debt, my Debt to Income ratio was out of range, I pleaded many well known banks in area, and many credit unions in towns, whose client I was for many years,and some of the On line mortgage company, but they all refused, than I got a promotional letter from Secure one capital in February 20 , and out of shear desperation, I called them and met Ian O'Brien on line, he heard my narration, and initially he had the same response, but promised me to help me out by talking with others in management, and he came back after talking with Ren Jenkins and Nolan Eleccion, and said they can try to navigate my case, and within a week ball started rolling with few hiccups, but with their best efforts and utmost professionalism, by end April they gave me much more loan approved than what I could have imagined, and rate had been at par with market going rates, and let me put final words that in this kind of dealing, both party try their best to take advantage, but even their CEO once stepped in and clarified some of our doubts, and Ian had been very cool and composed from day one up to end, (he responded to me on Sundays even, what he could not get on Friday, a great person) .
I will definitely refer them to all my acquaintances, wish them a great success and best of luck.< /text>

<username>Jacob Gosch<//username><Date>1592857659494</Date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>Total sham of a company. I started the refinance process with them the end of February from a mailer I was sent. I was told by them after getting all the information they requested we were going to close at the end of March and they told me not to make my next mortgage payment. At the beginning of the process they were very responsive and were responding to my questions in less than 24 hours. Starting in April I stopped hearing from them regularly and the response times to my inquires were now taking 5 to 7 days. They kept promising me that we were close to closing and reminded me not to make any more mortgage payments because they said that would keep changing the payoff amount and would delay the acceptance and closing date. Fast forward to the beginning of June and I was finally given a closing date and they promised to send me the final documents for approval the next day, and if I was happy then we would close 5 days later. They never sent the documents and it took 7 days, 5 emails and I lost count of the phone calls before I finally received a response back from them. They said there was a problem getting my loan approved. This coming after they told me we were approved and ready to close 2 weeks before. They told me they lost some of my paperwork and need me to resend it and reminded me again not to make my mortgage payment. Then on June 16 I finally was able to receive a responses from them after I threatened to go to the BBB. They gave me a bunch of excuses as to why we couldn't close and blamed me for the problems. This company is a sham and the people I dealt with are flat out liars. So scam and liar alert from Secure One Capital and employees: Ren Jenkins (Closing Agent NMLS# 866486) Ian O'Brien (Mortgage Banker NMLS# 1810942), and Elizabeth Galaviz-Gomez (Senior Processor NMLS#239738).</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Terrible company. Dillon Forst assured me I had the loan! Not once but twice!!
paper work was sent to me, then I was told they lost all my files. Reapplied with 3 separate faxings from B of A to get my mortgage balance! I still owe $90 to B of A!!
Appraisal of $500!!!!!!!!! I spent for nothing!
They are not truthful with you up front. They are not educated to screen properly and tell you what income counts as income!
His cell phone was a side business he was running as well as this shifty job.
Now I get another email 4/28/2020 asking if I’m still interested in refinancing with them!
Ha! NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

Christian Porter at Secure One Capital Corporation did an outstanding and superb job in getting our loan approved and closed. Wow, thank you so much Christian, of all the years since we purchased our first home in 1996 and after retiring from the US Army, the process with Secure One Capital has really given us true belief that not all lenders will fit the same category. This one was the fastest, well informed and truly honest folks working to help us get this done so thank you to the whole team at Secure One Capital Corp.

We are very grateful for your superior and actionable expertise in getting this done just as our first call, you made it happen from day one to closing in record time so thanks again Christian Porter and may God continue blessing you and your team.</review>

To Whom It May Concern:
After receiving a letter in the mail from Austin Beck, of Secure One Capital Corporation, I implemented an investigative call regarding the possibility of a refinance for our home.  I was greeted with an extremely pleasant & energetic call.  Austin very patiently listened to my husband’s & my situation, which is not optimal based on debt to income parameters, but very good regarding Credit Scores. Austin was able to provide the best advice I could ever ask for, versus other companies being very judgmental regarding our dilemma. You see, my husband was struck with a serious disability in the last two years. This has caused us to incur a lot of debt to accommodate his needs and remodel our home to make it safe.  Through Austin’s kindness, knowledge, professionalism, diligence and hard work, he was able to work out an extraordinary refinance for Russell and I. His has been a gift to us. In my husband’s words, “He’s Awesome”.
Austin is always open to my questions, and if he doesn’t have an answer, he gets one. His responsiveness is rare these days. He always gave me hope, but not false hope. His honestly and integrity is unbelievable.  Please do your best to reward Austin for his wonderful qualities. As I told him many times- there will be a place in Heaven for him. (and his team).!!!!!!
Sincerely,
Mary Lou Kramer-Bickner & Russell Bickner<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Branch Manager and Loan Officer Bruce Edgell, Branch Assistant Matt Oliver, Senior Processor Elizabeth Galaviz-Gomez, Opening Processor Gardenia Astudillo, and Loan Funder George Madrid, were ALL magnificent in opening AND closing/funding my refinance within just 30 days (April 1 to April 30, 2020).  I value customer service, sometimes even over loan rate or terms, yet Bruce Edgell's team at Secure One Capital exceeded my expectations on all fronts.  I saved well over $500 per month on my mortgage, got an incredible fixed rate, and received white glove handling throughout.  Nice work.  Would recommend.</Text>< UserId.>

Rick Albrecht was the loan processor that assisted in the refinance.  He was extremely professional and kept me updated. He explained the process and the time period it would take.  He was right on target.  From start to finish, there were no issues.  It was one of the fastest refinance I had ever had.   I would recommend this company and especially Rick.< /review>

<review>Recently, I worked with Mr. Fadi Malkosh and Secure One Capital to refinance our home and I highly recommend his services and this company. Professional service from day one, explained everything in detail, answered all of our questions, to which there were no surprises. As a veteran, I can't say I've had a better experience with home financing. Many times Mr. Fadi waited on us to provide information to expeditiously process our requests, not in a pressing way, though he completed all tasks from his end promptly and usually ahead of schedule. With other companies I've dealt with, it is usually the other way around, which is a waste of time. Again, I highly recommend this company and service provided my Mr. Malkosh.< /review>< pictures>

This is the 2nd refinance I have obtained with the help of Bruce Edgell of Secure One Capital Corp.

I was able to originally finance the home in my name with Bruce's help, following my mother's passing.  This is now the 2nd refinance to lower my interest rate.

Even though my income has been significantly reduced this time, as I am now retired, Bruce once again delivered what he said he would.

In this day and age, finding someone you can trust to be honest and upfront with you is a rarity.  And in the world of finance, virtually impossible.  Bruce is this kind of man.  It is especially significant with Bruce, since we have never met face to face.

He is extremely knowledgeable, patient, and he has helped me so much.  I have sung his praises to both family and friends.  Should they want to explore purchasing a home, or refinancing, I know they could not do better than Bruce or his company, Secure One Capital Corp.

It is a certainty that if I ever choose to buy a different home, Bruce Edgell and Secure One will be the only call I'll need.< /Review>

< Review>
Regarding Refinancing our Home with Austin Beck at Secure One Capital:

I have personally spent my entire life in the customer service industry. The last 20 years being in call center management and quality assurance. I will say that my initial perception of Austin was that he must be young and of little experience. However, throughout this entire, what should have been lengthy process, he has proven to be one of the best in his field! He was able to provide the interest rate we required which is lower than any of the other companies were able to! He minimized the length of this process by being an absolute perfectionist in the areas of diligence and efficiency. He was available at anytime, within a few minutes. That is, if we needed to do anything at all. He truly bent over backwards. Whether it be by phone, text, or email, Austin has accomodated us in any method we have required and expeditiously. Even though this process is complete, he continues to answer any questions and provide the same expedited service! Austin's customer service skills are impeccable!

This is our second time refinancing with Secure One Capital with the same excellence. I recommend no one else! No other company has shown to offer more in any of these areas that really matter. Thank you Austin and Secure One Capital!

<Text>Thank you Basilio and Janene at Secure One Capital!!!

My wife and I were shopping for a Home Equity Conversion Loan and a friend referred Basilio and Janene at Secure One Capital. I can't say enough about them. In every aspect of the loan process they surpassed every other lender we talked to in rates, fees and service. They carried us through the process with personal care and expertise.
We highly recommend them for any financing need.

Sincerely,

Ron and Patricia< /Text><user>114095203806925494997<//user><GmapID>0x80dcdedf7d9cc823:0x1cee113b397bf633< /GmapID><user_name>Patricia Mendoza</user_name></record></dataset><record>
<Text>We had the pleasure of working with Fadi Malkosh during our refi. He made the process smooth and easy by being very transparent, honest and extremely responsive. At first, I was a little skeptical working with him but over time, he proved that he was there to help and his full intention was to place our financial situation in a better position than what we were in currently. For this, I am eternally grateful that he was able to assist us and better a financial needs. I would recommend Fadi to anyone that is looking for a rep that is pleasant, honest and easy to work with.

One con - this would be the process towards the end of our refi. Having to work with the Title company was a bit of a nightmare! Ticor Title was terrible from signing docs all the way to issuing checks/payments. Our Escrow Manager was Deanna Baker and she never once responded my phone calls regardless how urgent it was. She only responds to emails and even with that, her response was not satisfactory. Her customer service lacked personability, accommodations and understanding. She was far from being flexible or wanting to extend help. As I right this, we still have some unresolved situations that requires her attention!

I give Fadi Malkosh at Secure One Capital a 5 star however, due to the unpleasant experience with the Title Company, I can only give a 4 star.<//Text><rating>4</rating>< Response>

Received a piece of mail advertising refinance options from this company. Contacted Daniel Ortega 06JUN. After sending him all of the papers requested of me (pay stubs, W2's, tax returns, etc.) I could no longer get a hold of him. 28JUN I contacted Laura Mai and requested a new rep. Got paired up with Albert Bennett. Communication was much better (at first). Appraisal happened mid-JUL. Was told every month that we would close "this month" and to not pay my mortgage with my original company. Luckily I did not listen to that advise because now 4 months later, and weeks of no ability to get a hold of Mr. Bennett, he called me and said they are unable to do the loan because the VA put a time limit of 01SEP2019.
I should have never responded to the piece of junk mail I received 4 months ago. Disastrous company and dreadful communication skills.< /review>

<Review>Received a mail from them, stating refinance with good interest rates, no closing cost, etc. Called Secure One Capital, Karen Monroe picks up the phone call...and that is the start of frustration. I have provided their reference number on the letter they sent to me and all the info to Karen, but the rate and fees are so faaaaar away from the mail they sent to me. Furthermore, Karen is making all kinds of noobies mistakes yet she claimed she has 15+ years of experience. I wish I could have lookup the bad reviews for Secure One Capital, seems like I am not the only one having this junk mail situation.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x80dcdedf7d9cc823:0x1cee113b397bf633< /gmap_id><Time>1583623434240<//Time><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

<Review>Bruce Edgell did an amazing job. There were so many questions, worries, and times my fiance and I were stressed out about the purchasing of our first home. Every time we made a call to Bruce, we felt 100% more confident about the process. He was always positive and explained everything thoroughly. He responded within the hour of my emails and phone calls. 5 star service was truly experienced.
Also, we were in contact with Janene Spargur during the whole process and she was on top of everything they needed from us, but also anything we needed from her. We love our new home that we have welcomed our first newborn to! Thank you again Secure One Capital for helping us get through it all!< /Review>< Rate>

Bruce , Jeff and Siara were such a blessing during this whole process which made things so much smoother especially do to the fact they are working with and against the VA which can make everything more difficult even though this should not be the case. These three individuals were quick to answer any questions almost always picked up the phone or answered emails and miss calls almost instantly which in return made me feel safe and secure. I would definitely use them again and share this company with others looking to refinance their home. Great people make up for great Buissnes period. Thank you again for all the help.</review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>My husband and I had a very positive experience refinancing our home. We appreciated the professional service provided by Chase Cunningham. He was very knowledgeable about switching to a VA loan. At each stage we knew what to expect. Communication and efficancy was very high and we highly recommend working with Mr. Cunningham and the company.
We met or exceeded all of our goals with this transaction. We are 200 miles away and so we could not come into an office and that was not a barrier. Everyone we worked with locally from repair men,appraiser and Notary were all of the highest quality and very professional. Thank you for making this a process we could feel comfortable with and trust that we were getting the best results.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

<Name>A D< /Name><date>1550688316189</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Worst experience of our lives. We first contacted rick albrecht a couple months ago looking for a cash out refinance. (I explained to him due to severe plumbing issues in our home that we only bought 2 years ago we had to dump over $40,000 into repairs) after some discussion, rick told us our home should appraise for enough to pay off over $700 a month in bills, give us a $2000 cash refund, $1100 in escrow refund and be able to hold 2 future payments for about a $1200 mortgage payment (interest rate going from 3.625 to 5%). Amazing right? WRONG! So wrong! For starters the house appraised for much less then we anticipated (not ricks fault I know) but we were promised that we could still pay off 2 cards, receive $1500 cash back and $1100 back in escrow with a new mortgage of $1014. All said and done we got those two cards paid off. But DID NOT receive any cash back, only $760 in escrow, and only got to hold 1 future payment. Rick never informed us that in order to hold 2 months payments we had to purposely not make January’s, he never informed us we were not receiving money back till after we signed. And now, a week before our first payment is due it is not $1014 a month, but $1181!  We will NEVER do business with rick or his company again I urge everyone to look elsewhere! You are only gaining a temporary solution to a now 30 year problem.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdedf7d9cc823:0x1cee113b397bf633<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We have recently closed on our refinance with Secure One Capital. This could not have been accomplished without the guidance and help from two knowledgeable, professional, and responsive individuals keeping us on track through the entire process. We felt as though we were informed of the progress from beginning to end and would be happy to work with Austin and Nicole any time in the future. BC & JW</Review>

<Text>This was our first refi on our home with Secure One Capital. From beginning to the end, our executive mortgage banker, Cameron Henderson has always been with us every step of the way to make sure that everything went smoothly. He was always in contact with us about our loan. As soon as our loan was funded, we just had to tell our friends and family how happy we were to be able to refi our home with Secure One Capital. Not only we get lower interest rate and a lower monthly payment, but also get to skip our first payment which was a tremendous help considering we were going through a financial hardship. We're also considering doing a cash out in the near future. We highly recommend these guys. They've helped us and I'm sure they can help you too. Thank you so much...appreciate everything you guys do for us.

Mr. Albrecht is a professional, efficient and a very pleasant gentleman. He was most helpful in completing endless paper work and to meet requirements in a very kind and timely manner. He keeps his word, is very prompt and truthful. I would highly recommend him for even difficult situations and expect to get the work well done.</text>

Adam Afghani, is a great 👍🏾 guy with great personality. He was very punctual in terms of keeping my husband and I informed of our loan process, he returns calls immediately and tackled any issues that needed to be worked on.
Adam is a people person, very professional and love his job, and always placed his clients first.
It was nice doing business with Adam, and will also do the same in the future.
He made the loan process less stressful
Adam is once again a great guy who finds joy in his job as it reflects on how he takes care of his client.
Awesome Adam

<Text>Secure One was fantastic to work with.  Everything happened so quickly!   I had an error occur with my mortgage payment during the process.  Bruce Edgell  worked with the VA and the underwriters to help get my loan approved without affecting my interest rate.

Bruce Edgell worked with us on refinancing our existing loan with Secure One Capital.  Since we had a loan history with Secure One, the documentation process was a breeze.  He kept us apprised every step of the way by letting us know our status during the loan process. We had a very positive experience with Bruce, who was efficient, professional and who was diligent in making sure he was doing the best for us and our financial needs.  We were approved and funded within a months time thanks to Bruce and his team at Secure One Capital!<//review>

<Text>Working with Bruce Edgell has been like being helped by someone who wants the best for you. Not only does he make you aware of what is going on, but is there every step of the way of your loan process. Never once did he not answer all my questions, and he also returned every call. This is my second loan with Bruce and I know I will be in touch if I ever, or my friends, need help in the future.</Text>< UserId.>

Very Thankful ~

Bruce Edgell was absolutely amazing. My father just refinanced his house; it started off a nightmare. Then, we found Bruce. WOW! I could not have been more thankful. He was so very patient with my father and extremely informative. This was my father's first refinance, so he really had no idea how the process worked. Typically, I assist my father with his financial transactions, this includes fielding all of his questions, gathering information and completing paperwork. Not this time; Bruce took so much of the time consuming, tedious work off my hands. Most importantly, my father felt comfortable with Bruce due to the fact that Bruce took the time to speak with my father and answer all of his questions. It is hard to find an agent (or anyone providing services) that care about their customers level of satisfaction with the business transaction. Bruce was very professional, respectful and patient. I would definitely recommend Bruce Edgell to my clients, family and friends!

Thank you!<//Text>

I was very hesitant to have my home refinanced so recent to my last refi, but I was getting so many offers in the mail I had to look into it. I did my research and found Secure One Capital to be a trustworthy company. I contacted them and spoke and worked with Bruce Engell who was courteous and professional. They were quick on their response time and got us a rate of 1% lower which saved almost $200 monthly. This was huge. We signed and closed within 30 days and we are very happy campers. I highly recommend this company and Bruce Engell in particular.</review>

<text>Update: I am on my 4th refinance with secure one capital. I always do my due diligence by shopping around but I always get the best rates with them. I have dealt with Bruce Edgell through out the years and he always is honest and upfront. I would like to personally thank Bruce Edgell, for all his help during the loan process. I have worked with Bruce and Secure One corporation several times and appreciate their hard work and dedication. The first loan I got through them was after several attempts with other lenders, but nobody could work with me with my credit score. Secure One Capital not only met my needs for the loan, but put me into a loan that  met my immediate needs and also paved the way for my credit score to improve quite significantly. I want to personally thank Bruce and Secure One Capital team for taking care of all my worries thank you.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Very unprofessional and negligent

Bruce Edgell and Jeff Pollock told me to skip my mortgage payment for
April then said we started too late, so here I was, making my payment late
Then they convinced me that we would be fine to start proceeding through May, so I was late again..... no one bothered to call or even answer my calls, and when I did get Bruce on the phone, he tells me
(NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS)
After all that, I get an email saying that I needed to talk to CHAFA
These two clowns gave me the run around and couldn't even do their job...

I went with American Financing and have everything done that had to be done

PS
I am filing with BBB</Review>

People,  My name is, Staff Sergeant Terry R. Calandra, USA. Ret. I had the pleasure of doing Mortgage Refinance Business with Mr. Austin Blake & Ms. Nicole, in regards to our property at 6 Valley Drive, Belvidere, NJ 07823. I'm a 100% Combat Wounded Disabled Vietnam Veteran '69; I'm highly decorated with 12 awards for valor, including 5 Purple Heart Medals. Austin/Nicole presented several options to refi our home. Austin was a class act. He helped me through all the questions & paperwork that was needed to bring our refi to a satisfactory conclusion. I would recommend Austin/Nicole to everybody & anyone looking to refi their home, purchase a New Home, especially first time buyers. Warmest Regards, T.R. Calandra.<//text>

Fantastic professional service from Garret Bradshaw and all the staff there!
They returned every phone call  very promptly and knowingly over the 3 week period it took me to get all the paper work to them.

Funded my loan very close to the original date quoted and a significantly better rate!

I would use them in a heartbeat and reccommend them to anyone looking to refinance!</Text>

<review>Bruce Edgell did a great job in securing me a home loan and getting rid of the PMI which was costing me several thousand dollars a year. He was most professional and knowledgeable of the many aspects of borrower qualifications and really went the extra mile to get my home loan approved in the fastest time possible. Bruce is truly an asset to Secure One Capital and I highly recommend him along with the services of this fine finance company!< /review>< Rating>

<Review>Don't do it! If I could give fewer stars I would. Things seemed to start off well, but after over 4 months they still haven't completed the process and not due to a lack of my trying. Once they mess up they just stop answering and responding. They used underhanded, bullying sales tactics to get me to agree to switch from another company and then didn't follow through on a single promise. Don't do it!</Review>< pics>

<review>We recently refinanced our home with Secure One Capital Corporation.  We could have never gotten it done without the tremendous hard work of:
Bruce Edgell (Loan Officer), I can't say enough about him.  He was always there to answer my calls and quick to get back to me with the most current information available. A special thanks to you.
Kacey Pate (Loan Processor), I'd like to thank you for being expedient on our loan.
Le Anne Keegan (Underwriter), Thank you for working so hard on our loan documents.
Ryan Marier (Chief Operating Officer), A huge thanks to you for being instrumental in getting our loan finalized.
I would give this company and their employees a 5 star rating.  They are the best and will get the job done.  Thank you all again for changing our life.
Sincerely, Bob & Pat Gallup

We just refinanced again to  lower rate thanks again to Bruce Edgell calling us back. I can't say enough about Secure One Capital and about how they care about Veterans.  I would also like to thank Kacey and Kristen for all of their help. They are a wonderful company and thanks again

<text>These guys will take you for a ride. They will leave you dry the moment they get the chance. Avoid them like the plague.

One agent in particular is Chris Tran. Oh man what a character. He is impolite and was rude with every inquiry made. And through further inspection, and after being yelled at we found out he was denied a license in Washington. Somehow he got it in California. As soon as we found this out, we ran out the door.

Avoid this place at all costs. For your own sake.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dcdedf7d9cc823:0x1cee113b397bf633</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>my experience with secure one capital was a very, very pleasant one, Michael Baker, a person with impectable knowledge of
his work and a wonderful attitude with people went through the process with me all the way and he performed an excellent duty to assist me in getting my refi done. I was informed every time of the steps we took what was happening. My hat's off to a person of his quality. I felt as if I had known him personally. Michael gave me information I had no knowlege of and wverything he said happened.  I give him a 10+ and yes I will recommend him and secure one capital to everyone I know who is trying to buy or refi< /Text></record>

If you are going to pull my loan information and make it look like it is from my current lender, I suggest you get an answering machine if you actually want business. Seems to me you are taking advantage of people with FHA loans.<//Text>

Secure One received funds from a prior lender ($10K+) that should have passed right along to the new mortgage servicer....that was 5 months ago. I called, emailed, and left messages. First they say they are "Looking into it", then it was "we are processing the action" and then said they sent the funds but THEIR CHECK BOUNCED! At this point I finally had to threaten legal action, then they said "how about if we just send you the funds?" Well great! I even asked if that was ok(legal)... "oh, it's been this long, it's ok" So they send me a check very promptly, I put it in the bank waiting to see if it clears....and it did. Great. Now I go about paying off bills, even took a weekend away with the wife. Now 2 weeks later, they want the money back! They had sent me a check and one to my current mortgage company, who promptly applied it to mortgage principle.  (What should have happened 5 months earlier) now trying to figure out how i can wor all this out.  Thanks for the headache (migraine) Secure One Capital!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GO THROUGH CAPITAL ONE PLEASE READ THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND IF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION FEEL FREE TO MESSAGE ME ON YELP I WILL PROVIDE YOU SCREENSHOTS OF ALL THESE DOCUMENTS!!!

Let's start by saying perhaps they should not have taken us on and preapproved us if they were going to have trouble funding the loan. But they did and we were referred to Chris Tran of secure one, he seemed a bit fishy in the beginning but we still continued to go through him since he already ran the credit and every thing.

Here's pretty much what has happened. We found a home we did everything and it came down to signing everything at escrow to get our keys. First the notary public and my husband noticed back dated documents. THEN upon further review, my husband realized he's signed a couple of the documents before but THERE WERE DIFFERENT, HIGHER FEES AND PRICES ON THE NEW ONES. He called Chris and was calm and just asked about the docs. Chris yelled at him and was like "WELL IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SIGNING THEM THEN DONT." When my husband asked "but if we don't sign the docs, then we don't get the loan right?" Chris goes "right." Me and the notary public could hear him yelling and we looked at each other. After the second call I grabbed the phone from my husband and yelled right back at him. And he was belligerent and not even trying to do anything BUT yell so I hung up and the notary public said she wanted to try to talk to him. She was taken back on what Chris was saying and his attitude. When she called him she could barely get a full sentence out because he was yelling at HER!

The notary public straight out said "I'm sorry I cannot bare witness to you signing these documents because they have been backdated." Not just like a week, these were predated WELL OVER A MONTH'S TIME. WE WERE TOLD TO GO ELSEWHERE TO SIGN BC SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE HER BUSINESS OR LICENSE!! she said we should go to the lender at this time. So ok, we hopped into the car, I asked my real estate agent to come bare witness to the documents and see what Chris was going to say about this.

Blah blah. Ok, so we are currently 3 extensions in now. I'm about to have to find somewhere to live  until this home loan goes thru. There is 1 factor that we knew would be an issue getting a loan, but I mean, we were pre approved already so we didn't think we needed to worry. PRE APPROVED. Now, after the under writer who is related to the owner accused my husband as a fraud (girl you need to calm down about your weekend plans and do some real work on Fridays. The bars ain't going nowhere) now they have "flagged" our file for internal review. The seller is wanting to back out and my real estate agent is practically begging for them not to back out.
The  notary public/escrow company owner has been trying to get a hold of the director/supervisor at secure one to see what's going on, since we already wired the down payment (over 100k) and 18k of (I don't know what that's called) but she's being ignored as well.
This is just the short version. There is much much more. AND I HAVE THE DOCUMENTS HE PREDATED ALONG WITH THE SCANNED COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS MY HUSBAND SIGNED. Homeboy tried to get me to hand over the documents saying "oh, I'll shred those for you". Nah homie. I have them in a safe right now. Lol< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

When I contacted Secure One for a home refinance, Austin was my contact person. In conversing with Austin, he pulled no punches or created any false hopes with my situation, as it was a very difficult one involving many obstacles. Austin laid out a plan, assured what my goals were and we wasted no time getting to work on them. If I hit a snag, Austin always was there to help, even jumping in and handling things himself. This man is motivated, intelligent, and above everything else absolutely honest. I would like to say that he the foundation for this company. Thanks Austin!!</Text>

Excellent food. The California burger isn't too well seasoned, but it can be overlooked because the flavor was still fantastic.< /Review>

Love Assembly and the whole concept. I've been a loyal customer since you opened but the snapper tonight was a real disappointment. Super bland! Wine offerings we're great... Desert yummy.  The service outside was spotty for so many reasons.<//review>

Overall good restaurant for a date!

Been here twice, once in the late afternoon and once in the evening. Both times there was no wait for a table. Greeted very friendly and service was kind/helpful in general!

They give sooooo many fries with the burger. My eyes love it, but my stomach can’t handle it all. The burger was delicious but they were skimpy with the pickles and the meat was a little dry. However the bun was well done and the burger wasn’t falling apart.

Also tried one of their cocktails which was very alcoholic and fantastic.

Would definitely come back here but only when I feel like splurging a little because it’s definitely a tad pricey!<//text>

This is my new favorite place in town to eat! My friend took me there for my Birthday. Love the food!
Something that I'll prepare at home- very fresh, clean, delicious! Service was great too! I just found out
that has the same owner as Penny's ice- creamery which I absolutely love and trust their fresh, organic ingredients.< /review>

The atmosphere was nice and the service was great.  The bread they make in house is awesome.  We would have ordered dinner but it was a little on the pricier side of what we were wanting to pay.</Review></record>

<review>Expensive yet delicious spot if you're looking for a bite to eat in Santa Cruz.  The service was prompt and thoughtful and the menu provides and interesting array of choices.  The burger and fries are very good especially if you opt in for the garlic fries.  They also offer a wide variety of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks to choose from.  All in all a great place to spend an evening in downtown Santa Cruz.< /review><resp>None<//resp></record>

This place has been polarizing for me. Sometimes the food is GREAT but sometimes it's just plain bad.

It's a shame because Assembly has so much potential. It has a cool atmosphere, good drinks and a great location. If the food were more consistent this place would be one of my favorites.

Fortunately their brunch is really good so I still go for that. Haven't been disappointed with it yet. They make an excellent Eggs Benedict.< /Review>

Assembly is my idea of what a CA bistro should be. The food is innovative & interesting. The portions are reasonable and there are lots of great pairings with local wines and brews. the decor and surroundings are tastefully done and match the restaurant's vibe.Prices are fair.

I have been to Assembly a dozen or more times and the service can be spotty, I have had great servers and not so great, but I have never left feeling disappointed.< /Text>

Nice place located in the heart of downtown Santa Cruz. The food is tasty, creative, and features locally sourced ingredients from the area. The avocado basil dip with homemade chips is a must-have starter! Nice beer and wine list as well.</Text>

Waitresses we're good but it's clear no food was coming out of the kitchen. Saw a woman leave because she waited for an hour.

Waited for an hour plus for the Basic Breakfast, eggs bacon and potatoes and burnt toast, for 10 dollars and not presented nicely. Really disappointing :(< /Text>

One of the worst and saltiest meals ever. After waiting 35 minutes after ordering the waitress came by and asked if we would like some bread. There was salt on the butter! I ordered the soup of the day - cream of summer squash. I could barely eat any of it and would not have gone past the first spoonful if I hadn't been starving from waiting almost an hour. Yes we were a party of 10 but when we came in there was hardly anyone one else in the restaurant. All I could taste was salt, salt and more salt. My lips were literally burning from the salt. Not realizing my soup would be all salt and no flavor, I had ordered a side of the garlic fries. Guess what - too salty to eat. Someone needs to tell the chef that there are other flavors in the world. You can always add more at the table if you like, but unless they have invented a salt remover, there's no way to get rid of it once the chef with dead taste buds has dumped a pound and a half in. This is the second time I have had to eat at this place as part of a company function and both times my food was inedible. I worked in gourmet houses for much of my early life - I know what good food tastes like - this ain't it! And I wasn't alone in my opinion. Nearly everyone at the table complained about how salty their burgers were. Can't believe this place stays in business.</review>

If you’re a brown/black (or otherwise non white), you’ll be paying for bland, uncooked? food and lazy racism. The hostess first told me they only take reservations one day ahead and that there weren’t any seats open (she motioned at the entire restaurant, so I assumed she also meant the bar) - i even pointed out to her that it seems they weren’t very busy today, but I had left assuming that folks would arrive later for their reservations. other places were busy or had a wait, so I returned to ask if they had open bar seating. The same hostess said they did and I sat there. then, a couple came in and they told me they made reservations 30 min prior to their arrival and that they were being seated. I asked the hostess why she offered me different information for how reservations work.
unfortunately, she made up some half baked lie about how they had cut off reservations right after the couple had made them. I asked if I could then move to one of the many empty tables - at this point, all parties had arrived or she knew how many were coming. she did not seat me at a table. The couple who arrived behind me and was seated was white. actually, everyone who was seated was white. the hostess and the server both kept eyeing me suspiciously until I left (even after I paid). this was a disgusting experience and it was racism delivered lazily.</Review>

<Review>We went for an early dinner last Thursday evening and chose to sit at the bar where we were ignored.  When we finally got order our wine the bartender poured it and set it aside as if someone else was going to serve us??  I had to ask whether we could place our order to eat and he said "I was helping someone else but I guess you were here first".  How rude.  The burger was good but the other snack item off the happy hour menu was just okay.< /Review><Rating>3<//Rating>< user_name>

This place has great potential, and we had high hopes, especially when the bread we were served was fantastic, but all the pieces just weren't there. Service seemed understaffed, and we had to ask for things multiple times. The food was completely overpriced but only mediocre. My steak was extremely tough, the Mac and cheese was blah, and the $27 fish special was only okay. Overall, we wish we could've loved it, but it ended up being a tourist trap.<//Text>

<Text>Terrible.  Our server did her best but between the douche pajama boy owner and the inexperienced kitchen,  this was a terrible dining experience .  We were a party of 4  and 3 dinners came out a good 30 minutes before the 4th dinner. The duck was overcooked and the mussels  were dry with no sauce or flavor. The burger was fine but not worth the additional wait.  A very disappointing 2 hours. We won't go back.</Text>< Pics>

<review>1.  Stacked queue of reservations and hostess who was a bit overwhelmed with this and flow of non reservation walking.
2. We were seated before someone who had arrived before us.  (Hostess needs training).
3. The new head chef did NOT deliver what the previous head chef did.

I do not usually write review's but I want assembly to not dis-assemble because of interim key employee transition issues.  Hope the management reads this.</review>< Pics>

Delicious food.  We had to wait a bit for the food, but the service was good and the food was well worth it.  Every dish we saw was very well done.<//review>

A lot of people of color were turned away. The hostess on 07/21/18 kept turning away people of color or lying to them about when to make reservations. I personally witnessed her turning away a person of color and then seating a white family who also came in without permafrost reservations. This is really disturbing to see in 2018.< /Review><user_name>Jennifer Yu<//user_name><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

< review>
I was soooo excited to try Assembly, so shortly after I heard about it, a friend ( not a foodie and pretty tolerant) and I (definitely a foodie and very conscious of subtlety, service, presentation, freshness, etc) tried it. I got something that was so glad I can't even remember it.:-( and my friend had to send her dish back. To their credit, they were very sorry and very accommodating. But the replacement was just as bad. Overcooked chicken on a bed of undercooked beans. Not a good first impression. I have never been back because I really dislike paying high prices for bad food.
Of course who likes that? Rhetorical question. Should I give it another try? I'm reluctant.< /review>

Simple, short menu, but food is excellent and the wine & cocktails list very reasonable with many good wines by the glass.  Friendly staff & dog-friendly patio make it our favorite in Santa Cruz.</text>

<review>Met some friends for brunch here yesterday. Had a fantastic meal...great service, great atmosphere/decor & great food.

For me the highlight was the Scotch Olives that we snacked on while getting stuck in with our Mimosas. If you’ve ever had a scotch egg, you’ll know what to expect...just a smaller version, as olives are much smaller than eggs, but the overall taste o this eis just mouthwatering. I’d probably come back just for these alone.

I had a fried egg sandwich also, and it was perfect - 2 eggs, bacon, arugula, cheese, onions and a delicious aioli sandwiched between a couple of slices of sourdough bread. Best breakfast ever!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>117743212585185608895<//user_id>< user_name>

I've been here several times over the years. Currently, I put this in the 2.5 star, but on the lower end.  Used to be a 4 star.   The food was OK, lacked some basic elements and needed refinement. We actually reverted to 'safety dishes' based upon our first few plates as we were not confident on the execution of the other offerings.  Our server was slammed beyond belief when we were sat so I gave him some leeway.  Though,  some weird service moments not from our main servers (eg refilled my wifes empty water glass, but ignored my empty glass, and several other strange moments).  We left disappointed and in no hurry to go back.  Too bad since this place had once exuded quality food and service.  Hope the owners and new chef can turn it around.<//review>

Beautiful interior, great outdoor seating, excellent service, great food. We had Braised Pork on sweet corn spoonbread, and it was excellent (although it would have been better if the bread hadn't been so sweet). We also really enjoyed their poutine and their charcuterie plate.<//review>

< review>
I visited the assembly last night with my brother and friend and we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We order the garlic parmesan  fries and scotch olives as an appetizers and were very impressed. Even though these are just simple bar food type items, we really enjoyed them. We asked for some aioli to dip the fries in, which was no mistake. If you want to get the fries, I would highly recommend asking for aioli with them as well. Moving on to dinner, we ordered a goat cheese and quinoa fritter salad, the seared seasonal seafood, and the Manhattan fillet steak. I had the goat cheese and quinoa fritters. Although, I would not recommend them unless you really like goat cheese. I only tried bites of the steak and halibut, but they were both really good. Dessert is where Assembly looses a star for me. My friend described it as "sick and wrong", but I have to disagree with her. The sorbets were very, very sour, but I really liked the flavors. They were light and refreshing; exactly what a sorbet should be.

EDIT:
Took away a star aftera  return visit during restaurant week. While nothing was bad, but the presentation felt sloppy and the entrees were underwhelming. The meat board and fried cheese curds were good, but not good enough to maintain the four stars I had originally posted.</review>

I used to come here regularly before the panfemic. I came here with a friend last Saturday. Unfortunately, we couldn't order our usual dishes because of the extreme price hike. It was Saturday at 12:30 in the afternoon and you were forced to pay the dinner price. The platter of short ribs is $26.99 and the platter of chicken teriyaki was $21.99!!! I will not pay those prices. Sadly we were forced to order something else. The food was still good but I don't know if I will be returning.<//Text>

<gmapID>0x808fbf4586a24f11:0xc4961b13e9ba7778< /gmapID><text>The freezing brisk weather, as of late, had me 100% craving some good ol soondubu. With less than a handful of outdoor seating, they’re still mainly focused on takeout.

This was also my first outdoor dining experience since the outdoor dining reopened after the holidays. The staff were all wearing masks, as were the other patrons dining. Tables were cleaned and sanitized between customers.

Alright, enough w the logistics. Down to the good stuff. The bon chons! Yass. Seoul here does it right. Plentiful per serving, and *note* they’re unlimited! For entree, I got what I came for. Seafood soondubu. MM MM. While I ordered it in mild, my partner ordered it in medium. Mild was a bit too mild for me, but the medium was a bit too spicy. My fix? Get the mild and toss in some of that good ol kimchi!

Highly recommended. 4 stars!</text>< pictures>

My family loves ordering from this restaurant and typically does takeout orders for special occasions (birthdays, family parties). They're pretty generous portions, especially with the sides. We also enjoy the chicken ginseng soup and the seafood/beef pancakes. One of our favorite local businesses!</Text>

A nice Korean food restaurant. Like the Tofu soup best. Also, nice soup noodles( bit too salty) and seafood pancakes are very nice taste!
Lots of seats here, not crowded. Parking is convenient. You may experience the Korean tv program inside, interesting.<//Text>

Overpriced and tons of MSG.
When it’s not salty but you just can’t seem to have enough water after a meal, you know it’s MSG. I’m diagnosed with extra sensitivity to msg, so I can immediately sense it’s presence. This restaurant’s dishes are loaded with the chemical, even more so than most Asian restaurants.
Overpriced. $13 for cold noodles that came with 2 one-inch slices of beef. $23 for a one-person portion of bulgogi that didn’t even come with rice. In the end, spent $40 that only last two meals for a single person. The taste is very mediocre. Not sure if they bumped up the price in an attempt to stay afloat during the pandemic. It’s dishonest and unfair to the customers.
The restaurant has signs mandating masks. But the owner herself doesn’t wear a mask. Instead, she has this plastic cover that goes halfway up to the mouth area but is completely open at the top and doesn’t prevent any outflow of air whatsoever. Again, the selfish theme of “screw the customers, I’ve got mine.”</review>

Since my daughter gets crazy about BTS, she starts to like Korean food also, so we got to try all the Korean restaurants in the area. We've seen this one in the Lion Supermarket shopping center for a long time now, we tried it and went there a few times already.
Korean restaurants prices are mostly higher than Chinese or other ethnic food as I (payer) notice for the same quality and quantity. I think Korean food is more complex to prepare or just catered to Koreans who are accustomed to high prices.
The food is mostly spices and tasty in its own way. The home made noodles are quite chewy and the sauce is quite tasty, although they're just flour, my daughter love them for some reasons.
I and my wife like the hot and spicy seafood soup, which is great for when you're under the weather, will sweat after a hot bowl of soup and rice, quite tasty, easy to eat.
My son likes the Kimchi fried rice which I don't really care for, but as long as he enjoys it, it's fine to me.
The chap chae, Korean famous glass noodles are OK IMO, I can do better at home but it's OK to try.
Everyone likes all the little dishes of pickles that served in most Korean restaurants.
This place is quite clean and the service is excellent, all dishes are over $11 as I recalled which is not terribly expensive but for what we get, is a little overpriced. Anyhow, it's the taste that counts and as long as everyone in the family not complaining and finish their food.
So, this will be our regular Korean restaurant when we have the urge for some spicy food, all 4 thumbs up.< /review>

<Review>We got a combo (tofu soup and bibimbap) and it was around $21 and enough portion for two of us! We also got korean fried chicken to go and the portion for those are huge.
They also serve with delicious side dishes!

<review>Very nice people with ok food here there little appetizers are very delicious. Ordered seafood pancake, chicken wings and tofu soup. I would say the food state is 3 out of 5. But the little dishes they serve taste very good. And the people here is nice and attentive. Love the environment.
It’s right next to lion market so I come here quite often. Would<//review>< pictures>

<text>Unfortunately ate here on a sunday and was told it was all dinner price when we arrived for lunch which sucked. But the food was pretty good, typical delicious Korean food. However the menu was hard to read as it didn't have the usual Korean to English translation. It was Korean to Chinese to English, making the English one not the best. Typical Korean words I know like Bulgogi weren't even listed in the menu so I had to just assume it was the 'spicy pork'.  It was an ok experience but not rushing to come back.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>It's ok. Side dishes are not as fresh compares to others. Now remember this is what I received so it may differ for others. Would I recommend, well, if you don't want to drive to others and it's the closes one then I guess.<//Review>< Response>

<Text>So-so Korean food, but the service was a bit rushed and careless.  They seemed to be more concerned with getting as much people in as possible.

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>Arrived at a right time, before peak, only 5 - 6 table occupied.  Server are friendly, but seems like lack of manpower, everything slow.  You have to ask for the water / tea or you have nothing.  Waited for like 5 -10 minutes to take the order.  Wait for another 8 - 10 minutes for the Banchan, 8 - 9 dishes; then when they serve the entree , we have to empty some Banchan to make space, the table is already too small.  Ordered a Ginseng Chicken Soup, it tasted weird, no ginseng flavor, and can barely found the ginseng.  And the Stone pot bibimbap not as good as I expected.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) It's hard to eat Korean food in foreign countries.
This is different. It is more delicious than Korea.
I will.

외국에서  한국음식 맛있게 먹기 힘든데
여긴 다릅니다.  한국보다 더 맛있어요.
강추합니다.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I changed to a new owner two months ago, but the chef is a 20-year-old Korean chef who cooks and cooks himself.
Dolsot bibimbap is impressive and many customers prefer it.
The area was mainly based on Chinese guests, but these days, Koreans also have word of mouth, so I think they are looking for a lot.
Sundubu and ribs are also popular.

2개월전에 새로운 주인으로 바뀌었는데 주방장 경력이 20년된 한식전문가가 주인이며 직접 주방장으로 음식을 만듭니다.
돌솥비빔밥이 인상적이며 많은 손님들이 선호하더군요.
지역이 중국손님들 위주였는데 요즈음 한국사람들에게도 입소문이 나서 많이들 찾는것같습니다.
순두부와 갈비도 인기 메뉴인것 같습니다.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The restaurant is also large and delicious. I ate Sundubu Jjigae and Dolsot Bibimbap. The side dishes were fine. Think about 12 dollars per person including the tip.

식당도 큰편이고 맛있습니다. 순두부찌개랑 돌솥비빔밥을 먹어보았는데 맛있었습니다. 반찬들도 괜찮았고요. 팁포함 한사람당 12불 정도 생각하시면 될것 같습니다.</Text>< Name>

Chris and Jake were extremely helpful and professional.  They helped us from beginning to the end of our loan. This is the second loan we do with them and we couldn't be happier. They made the whole process very smooth for us and never once failed to address my concerns or answer my questions.<//Text>

<Text>My experience was overall a good one.  Not sure if it is every loan that goes this way, but it would be nice to have all of the paperwork and requirements ahead of time.  I kept getting asked for more information and more information, more documents to sign, etc.  It seems like perhaps a more thorough package could be prepared for all of those possibilities, and to get all of that information in the beginning.  The process took much longer than I think it should as a result.

However, once it got done, it was funded very quickly.  I never had any problems or issues with any of the persons involved.  There are many moving parts I am sure with transactions such as this, and I am grateful to the broker and Val Chris for helping me get what I needed.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
My house was in foreclosure: I was behind with payments because of unexpected financial hardship; but I had good equity in the house. This was an extremely stressful situation!
Val Chris Investment accepted to refinance the old loan! In the process, they were meticulous, honest, and extremely cordial as well! The whole process was switf and smooth; and I we were able to close escrow in less than a month! Such a relief!
Val Christ saved my house; and did so in such an efficient but warm manner! I recommend Val Christ to anyone facing a situation similar to mine!</Review>

Being self employed makes for an interesting application process.... Val-Chris allowed the equity in the property to be the focal point of the loan process rather than the numbers on a page.... via my broker the loan process became a diligent examination of details, but it got done.< /text>

<Text>My experience with the Loan Process was terrible. I was wondering what happened to the service because I did business with this company before. I never had this much problems along the way.

It was very frustrating having to deal with issues such as: my rep not providing updates, miscommunication between escrow and my loan rep which lead to me, having to re-signed loan docs twice.

One part of the process my rep was out of the picture ...didn't inform me that my file was going to be transferred or no longer working on my file. He just stopped returning my emails. I had to deal with the escrow company by myself to get information at one point. Eventually someone new took over my file, close to the end of the process.

Again, the service was terrible and to know that I had to pay such a high cost to receive that kind of service, you can imagine how upset it made me.

I would not recommend Val-Chris Investment anymore. I had a great experience the first time, which is why I did business with them the second time around, but unfortunately I will not recommend or use their service anymore in the future.< /Text><rate>2< /rate><GmapID>0x80dcde851cec1931:0x345c4422a7245510<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>What a blessing it has become for me to know Val Chris Investments after much disappointment elsewhere!  A few deals had recently fallen through and I knew what I needed yet it seemed no one understood what I was saying... which left  me feeling defeated, frustrated and misunderstood.
Mr.  Ali virtually held my hand throughout the entire process.  But right away, in our first communication, I was relieved and excited by his confidence and relaxed but helpful nature.
He answered nearly all of my questions before I asked them and he always responded to my inquiries very promptly.
I can honestly say he continuously went above and beyond my expectations of service and I am thrilled to be on the other side of a closed transaction.  I  will  DEFINITELY be "back"!  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!</text><gmap_id>0x80dcde851cec1931:0x345c4422a7245510< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I have never used such a fast and efficient direct private money lender in California. I’ve worked with Jeff a few times and he exceeds my expectations on every transaction. I highly recommend contacting Val-Chris Investments for all of your private money needs.< /Review>

Great loan opportunities, stellar documentation, and impeccable customer service! Val-Chris Investments, Inc. is simply the best private money lender I have come across in 30 years of investing. PH<//Review>

No accountability, no communication (important emails seemed to never be received or ''must have made it to my spam folder'' - although emails before and after the 'important' emails' are received just fine), and finally no effort to go the extra mile to help the Broker when they have dropped the ball.  Very disappointed (again) with this lender.  No lender should make the transaction harder for you...and yet Val-Chris always does.<//text>< Name>

<review>ValChris--and the agent who personally worked with me--was superlative in helping me get a difficult loan.  The terms and timing saved my life!  I am very impressed by the hands-on manner in which they assured my success.  I will tell my officemates (in next office meeting) and colleagues in the field about their excellent service.  The integrity and ethical behavior were evident from start to finish.  Thank you, ValChris and Kellie!<//review></record>

I'm very thankful for Val-Chris Investments for giving me the opportunity to get the house I need for my home-based business. I'm also very thankful for my real estate agent, Thomas Ruelas at Century 21-Rose Realty, and my broker, Martha Barbera, for helping me find a lender. They made it easy for me to get the loan. Once I've found the house I wanted, it only took them three weeks to facilitate the required documents. We closed the escrow on Dec. 16th.  Prior to Val-Chris, I've approached two well known big banks where I do my banking, but they turned me down because of my imperfect credit score. Yes, I recommend Val-Chris Investments,  (as well as my real estate agent and my mortgage broker), to anyone who wants a second chance to achieve their American Dream.  Thank you Val-Chris.</Text>

<time>1562795593922</time><Text>i would give less if i could i went in about a week ago for a trim and came out with a whole hair cut .the owner is saying the stylist Amy who did it showed me a picture but that never happened i know how i want my hair i have never had a short haircut. i definitely wouldn't have asked or agreed to the cut i have now. the cut was choppy and uneven they continued to cut more and more off. the stylist even took clippers to my hair ... for a trim. i asked fora trim to about my ears . the stylist first cut my hair into a mullet and was going to just leave it that way until i said something she thought the whole situation was funny she was rude so was the assistant manager. there was never any pictures being shown she just started chopping away. my hair is still choppy and uneven i have to let it grow out before i can even get it fixed. the stylist here definitely need more training and customer service training. my great grandmother went in today for a trim (against my advice) and is also unhappy her hair is choppy and uneven one side is way shorter than the other and they kept cutting more and more off they obviously don't know what a trim is and she seen a different stylist. i highly do not recommend this place. pictures of what it looked like before and then after clearly shows its not a trim you could see the front pieces are longer than others its uneven.</Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< Pics>

<text>My favorite place to get haircuts since years! Love how they do shampoo then cut...the shampoo process is so relaxing. Most of the staff is very calm and friendly. However, Isabel is my all time favorite! She does quality over quantity. She takes her time, doesnt rush and pays attention to details. Plus, the place is pretty quiet...no loud music or voices.< /text><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

New to area already had a horrible experience at another salon, I was very hesitant to try another salon, but so glad we tried Hair Fusion today, wonderful experience!
Lori cut my husband's hair...great hair cut and Taryn colored and cut my hair. Love the color.  We are both very pleased and going back.
Very clean and staff is friendly.<//Review>

<Review>Lori is AWESOME! Been taking my son there since he was about 3 or 4 and we are still going to this day and he is 8. She takes her time no matter how long it takes. His haircut is amazing when she is finished. Even my son says am I going to see Lori today?  Most of the hairdressers in there are very friendly. I love hair fusion.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< response>

Earlier today i went to the salon on oswell for a simple Wash and cut, and mind you this was my second attempt to try this place out. Well I walk in and sign in, waited for about 20 min and I was the only one waiting and there was a stylist doing nothing  and would look at me and ignored the fact that I'm waiting. So about another 5 min I FINALLY was greeted and seated the stylist I got was amazing but as for the the others HORRIBLE! I guess they only take in the people they know.< /text>

< review>
The staff in general seemed nice but I asked how much a womans haircut was. And they said $17. But once I was in the chair I was told it was going to be more because I had long hair and she didn't say it until she was rinsing my hair. I paid $25. Which I wouldn't have minded if that was the price I was told from the beginning. Also... the stylist I got was kind of aggressive/heavy handed which scared me a bit but she got the job done.<//review>

I wouldn’t even give them a one star my husband came in for a trim he has long hair and the lady first gave him a mullet then shaved his head and ended up giveing him a a man hair cut / a line and the worst part is that the lady named Amy cutting his hair thought it was so hilarious then the one manager was rude about it like really and to top it off she just kept cutting it and it’s all choppy definitely not fixable and was gonna leave it in a mullet</Review>

<Text>I had the worst experience in this salon, I have been doing my own hair over 10 yrs and i am Not a professional. The 1 time i wanted to be pampered. Has left me with Broken off 3in strands of hair all over my head. I Cried in the car when i left this place. I went in for touched up bleached roots she overlapped way to much, also continued to remind me of how much hair i had. Saying "You have Sooo Much Hair" She took about 1 hr applying the bleach to the roots. Then she put me under the dryer for 20 minutes.  When she washed it off. My hair was literally Falling off to the touch. She implied it was normal.  Yes its normal. But Not a hand full of hair normal. I was going to be charged 175 dollars for this Garbage.  But i spoke to the lady in Charge at the time and she said if i was not happy i would not have to pay. Who would be happy with hair breaking off... :*( I am so sad. I have to walk around with this horrible job done to me.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1484010867339, 'text': 'After speaking to all of my managers and stylists in all three locations, we are puzzled because we have no record of your visit.

<text>My experience with Hair Fusion on Oswell Street was very positive. The beautician "Lilly" did an outstanding job on my mother-in-law. That speaks volumes because my mother-in-law is very particular. Her name is Mary and she's in her 70's. Mary has a lot of medical issues, consequently, she is unable to sit for very long. Lilly treated her with kindness and respect and was able to do a great job in a timely manner. I highly recommend Hair Fushion on Oswell Street.
Gratefully,

Ive been coming to the Oswell location near Petsmart for forever! I went to super cuts many times and hated every cut but i love this place. Not only is the price afforable but everyone ive got a cut from at Hair Fusion is amazing. I have short hair and for me its hard to find a stylist that can manage my hair right but Isabel is my savior! Shes always friendly talks about her family and is always on par with her cuts. I dont think I would let anyone else cut it anymore! In short, LOVE THIS PLACE AND ITS STAFF!< /review>

I just called to ask a question about type of perms they do. The lady who answered, I might be wrong, apparently was having a bad day because she was rude and after I said thank you she just hung up. If the way they answer the phone, is the way I'm going to be treated at the salon, might as well not go. I did get an answer, but the way she answered it could of been better</Text>

<text>I  took my four year old daughter in to get her hair cut.  We waited over a half hour to be called when people that came in after us were called before us.  When we were called back my daughter started to cry and the lady that had called us back looked at me and said I can't do her.  I told her that she would calm down when we sat down.  We sat down and my daughter was still upset  the lady that called us didn't try to calm her down or talk to her I told her if she started to comb her hair and spray it a little with the water she would be fine but she just told me no I won't do her.  I have been getting my hair cut here for years and have always been happy with them they have always done a good job and have been very nice until today.  If the people that work there don't want to cut kids hair they shouldn't be advertising that they do I will not be coming back.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>107003686881944734379<//user>< username>

<Rate>3</Rate><user_id>107897843086818605007< /user_id><Review>It's a great place and there is one lady I like there so far.  But there is a guy who works there, and I dunno if he does a good job on women's hair, but since the first time he been there, and 5 years after (he cut my hair twice), he still cannot cut a guy's hair and I wonder where he got his credentials.  Luckily I have clippers at home, but the dude had the nerve to ask if I wanted to leave a tip after he F*#&D my hair up and had to call someone else to try and fix it..  and then I had to go home to fix it and I had to drive 80mi to make a show I was playing at in Lancaster that night short on time as it was.  Honestly, I wouldn't even have the audacity to even charge someone, messing up hair like that.  I learned how to cut my hair myself, and if I need to save time, I will be happy to return here to have Lilly cut my hair.  Not only does she do a good job, but she is pretty as well and great to talk to.

But that guy who cuts hair there needs to look into another field of work like a mop job at walmart, if he can even manage that.

I am sure he is probably still there and this happened last year, but the only reason I write now is because I was looking to go there again after a long time away, and was looking up the store hours and had just called to see if Lilly is there.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>F.

<text>Unbelievable. .... took my 90yr old mom to get a perm. There was no clients ther,just stylist sitting in there chairs.finally was asked if we has an appointment.  So the girl yells back to a heavy set Hispanic woman that her perm was here .she never came to greet my mother she just walked to the back to the shampoo bowl...so I took my mom and tried to tell this very rude person who acted like she had better things to do..how I wanted my mom's hair done since she neglected to do a conso. Asked to wrap in pink rods and not to cut it short because  she get spits if there is not enough weight .I have been a stylist four 34yrs I only took her here because I have been injured. With I could send a picture of my mother's hair or lack of it is so terribly shirt what a Waite if a perm to have it all cut off .she it so sad just keeps saying she don't want no one to see here and it coat here $60.... the owner needs perjue some employees and replace with pleasant and skilled team.< /text>< GmapID>

<Review>Terrible!! Horrible!!!! Awful!!! Went in for a touch up on a weave and you can still see the line where the hair grew out!! Style was terrible and stylist did not listen to how much I wanted cut. I told her three inches and she barely cut anything! I want my $100.00 back to go to a real salon.<//Review>< Time>

{'time': 1398892978959, 'text': 'First, I apologize for your experience. We stand behind all of our work, and can fix this at no charge. I looked up your record card and see that this is your second visit for the same service. Since you were happy with the first stylist, can she repair this for you? I appreciate when someone lets me know there is a problem so I can further train the stylist that performed the unsatisfactory service. Please call the salon or my office at 661-837-1119 so I can help. Thank you.'}</Response>

Overall, professional, courteous and accommodating. I called to extend my reservation, and the associate could not have been nicer. I would definitely consider Avis as a top choice on my next rental.</Review>

But  this time, not only we got  a very good price for 9-day rental, we also got an upgrade when we picked up the vehicle.  The  service  during COVID was quick but  professional.  We will definitely go AVIS now, at least for the personal rental.< /Text>< pictures>

We pointed out to multiple scratches that were not marked on the agreement, but the guy said that it was all good and we can go. Of course we took lots of detailed pictures and videos. Well guess what, when we returned the car to LA location they filed a claim for those scratches that were not marked. Complete waist of our time dealing with the insurance company!

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Rented a car during Christmas vacation. Thanks to Budget (Avis and Budget are the same in this location) for screwing my vacation!

The car they gave started leaking oil on the third day of rental. Called road side assistance and they asked me NOT to drive with the car with leaking oil and told they will send a replacement car to my location. Hence I pulled over to a nearby parking lot and was waiting for 6 hours in the cold. Finally the tow truck came and gave the replacement car and picked the other one.

The replacement car did not have full tank gas but a little less. The power outlet for cell phone charger / GPS did not work. Mentioned both the issues to the tow truck person and he said he is third party provider and can't help. I had no other go but to take the replacement car and drive without GPS.

Between this numerous time I called road side assistance to know where they were and why there was a delay even though they told I would receive the car within an hour. Then they said since it was NOT my fault and they said they will waive ONE day rental fee.

Finally after shivering on the cold for 6 hours I was on the road driving back home in the night (Usually won't drive in the night but had no other option). I thought the hassle was over but there was bigger one waiting for me when I went to this location to return the car.

I booked through Costco and got the rental for $165 (including tax) for 4 days (Plus $31 per day for full coverage insurance so the total rental cost should have been $165 + $124 = $290 at the max even without waiving the one day rental as agreed by road side assistance). But the bill generated was for $480. Yes you read it right, I was charged $480.

The charge includes $126 as fuel service fee - It seems the charge was for the fuel in the broken car because the car did not have full tank of gas. I did fill the gas about 40 miles before the car broke and also I do not understand how on earth I can fill gas for a car that broke in the middle of nowhere and when the road side assistance asked NOT to drive the car longer.

Then when I asked about the rental fee that should be waived for one day as promised by the road side assistance they reduced some amount but increased the other three days rental saying because that fee was waived Costco doesn't apply and I have to pay the normal daily rental fee.

They demanded to return the car with Full gas even though I told them the replacement car I got did not have full tank gas and this was also noted to the tow truck driver while accepting the car but they did not bother to listen and asked me to pay extra or take the car and fill the gas. Then I took the car again to fill it up.

When asked about the fuel service fee, they say they can't do anything and I have to call customer service, when I called customer service, they have to call the Vegas rental location and ask them to look at the logs and told they will return the call in an hour. After waiting for 3 hours called them back only to hear the customer representative yelling at me saying i need to give time for them to research on the case. Seriously??

You guys have my money and in return you yell at your customers.

NEVER again I am renting a car with Avis/Budget. GOOD BYE!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Cheating company. Don't rent a car from AVIS, at least not in this branch. It makes an additional $50 charge after I have paid everything online. I even pay more than the receipt they give to me.

I call their customer service, and they said they don't know the charge and no records in their system showing that charge. They can't help me and the only way I can do is to call my bank.<//text><user_name>Yu-Chih Tung<//user_name><resp>{'time': 1503438541460, 'text': 'We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, Yu-Chih.

Great place!! I rented a car from somewhere else for ten days and it was the more expensive than the month I rented for here. The owner is a very nice guy and is very accommodating. I have to get my car shipped here and he has made the wait so much more bearable.<//Text>

< Review>
The Owner and his staff were very nice to me. The car they gave me has worked great for me and they have really good rates as well. I needed a car because mine went down and I was really worried about having to rent a car but Express rent a car has made things very easy and provided me with great customer service. Thanks again<//Review>

<user>107522329063449056526<//user><Review>Although they say the cheapest around are expressed rentals. They're not that cheap they're kind of pricey actually. But if you're a foreign student you can get great deals. 149 a week with insurance included. funny how far and students can get a better deal than somebody that's already here.. also when I try to call on a Saturday their website said opens at 9:00 there was another sign where I saw the deal that said open at 8:00 and actually another one that had said open at 10:00 a.m. where all that confusion and trying to get it from 8:00 on they never really opened up till 10:00 a.m.. so FYI on Saturdays they open at 10:00 a.m.. but not the greatest deal in San Diego for a rent car.<//Review>< Response>

Very knowledgeable and very nice doing business with them. No issues whatsoever with them. They said when we are in the area again to let them know and they would definitely rent to us again!< /Text>

The staffs were wonderful especially the young Asian lady who is always there when I rented their cars. Super cheap price beats all car rental in San Diego and the services are a plus. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking to rent a car for awhile.<//review>

I am a regular traveler, therefore it is important to find a high quality car rental company. I have been renting their vehicles for 2 years now, since 2019 & 2020. This agency is perfect! Raquel manages very well and has always treated me properly. She goes above and beyond to make sure I get a high quality rental and reliable transportation at a great price. Shiori is a good sales woman also. She has helped me many times with the contract & return elements. This diverse team offers multiple languages such as English, Spanish, and Japanese to assist many customers in car rental. I highly recommend this small car rental agency located next to San Diego International airport. Easy access. Yes, rent from them.< /Review>

<Text>Worst company ever,
First, they give you a car with problems or flat tires and they expect you to fix them!!
Customer service is terrible, they treat you like they're doing you a favor by giving you one of there cars! Im I renting it for free?!
The most important and worst thing is that they charge your credit card extra charges without letting you know!!!
I wonder how they're keeping companies like that stay open!<//Text>< gmap_id>

This was my second car I rented. Their pricing policy is competitive and the cars aren’t new but it’s a fair deal for the price you pay. The staff is really friendly. If you aren’t satisfied with the options, you can rent the available car and ask them to contact you back (which they usually do within a week) when they have more options. I would suggest to consider this rental car service.</Review>

{'time': 1545329314922, 'text': 'Hello Felix\n\nAfter you returned the car you were here for about 45 minutes and after the talk we had I thought you understood how the monthly rate is calculated. I broke down the dates and explained everything to you very clearly. I can tell you again that you were not charged incorrectly. I even showed you our email inbox with no email from you regarding the same.\n\nThe car we gave you was not the best car in our fleet, I agree. In fact it was the only car we had at the time, which was a good running car that never had any issues the whole time you had it. The pictures you posted look like they were taken just before your returned the car as we detail all of our cars before they go out. When you returned the car it was very dirty and I told you that I would waive the cleaning fee for you.\n\nWe are open 7 days a week you could have came by or called us any time within the 100+ days you had the car and we could have exchanged it if you were not satisfied or helped you with any questions. It is unfortunate that we did not hear anything from you till you returned the car as that does not give us a chance to resolve the issue.\n\nBest Regards\nExpress Team'}< /Response>
<Review>THE 375 $ PER MONTH IS A TRICK!
1/10 never again!

I said give me the cheapest car you have for three and a half months. They gave me a totally deteriorated corolla with mold on the ventilation slots.
And then they charged 475 $ per month because: „...if you want to rent it for three and a half months, you pay three monthly rates and two weekly rates...“.

As soon as I drove off I recognized they also cheated with the gas level because their cars are parking at a hill. They wrote down 5/8 - after I drove down the hill 100ft it was 4/8. Hopefully worth it...

During the time, the trunk lock broke. I wrote an e-Mail and also complained about the high price for that car*. No answer at all. Still no answers at return. No discount no excuse not even a free drop off at my place. Nothing

*yes you need the key to open the trunk and yes you need to lock and unlock every single door manually and yes you roll down the windows manually. And yes I understand that you get the cheapest car if you want the cheapest price. But this was not the cheapest price at all! So, not even close to reasonable...</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bad experience. Unfriendly staff. Old vehicles and high price. Definitely not my choice anymore. Never search for low rate car rentals. Pay 10 more bucks extra and have a safe trip. Saving money doesn't keep you safe. Never deal with greedy car rental enterprises. Stay safe and happy.</review>< Pics>

Shady shady Shady! Terrible experience! We made a reservation 3 months in advance to pick up our car at 10 a.m. with our 6 kids. When we went to rent the car they said it wasn't ready and It was in the shop.
2.5 hours later we finally get the car. My husband and I chose to only rent the car for 2 days vs the full 7 because as soon as we pulled in we knew it was shady. We told them we didn't have all the money (we didn't want to be rude.) So my husband made a deal 99 dollars a day for 2 days plus a 300 deposit because we used a debit card and not a major credit card. The vehicle had No gas, the a.c. was broken, driver side light was strapped on, and the roof rattled very loudly. I told them the least they could do was put gas in it for being 2 hours late the guy proceeded to say "We don't do reservations it's only first come first serve" even though I did one online. We returned the car after day 1 and wanted our deposit back but the SAME guy told us we had a reservation for 7 days and that 300 was for the 7 days. We reminded him of the first come first serve he told us the day prior. He talked in circles, contradicted himself, lied even though our contract was 1 day at a time with NO return date on it. They ripped us off 450 dollars later. So unbelievably unprofessional, terrible customer service. We WILL be turning them into the BBB. And please don't bother to respond with more lies and excuses, nothing you can say will change our opinion. Your employee is a bold face liar and he had the nerve to say that my husband told me a different story than the deal he made with him. Grasping for straws, my husband isn't even remotely that type of person. If I could give Zero stars I absolutely would. They have no shame in how they rip off people or even a family of 8 on vacation with 4 kids under 10.</text>

<review>Lied about insurance coverage. Given a Dirty Car. Charged inceorrectly. I flew all the way from overseas, and booked reservations for a car weeks in advance. The website told me I was booked, but when I got there, it was first come first serve. I booked a car for a month and when I got there the only availability was a dirty, dented, stained chipped,car that had hardly any gas that they just pulled up and gave to me, saying they didn’t have time to clean it and I can just bring it back as I found it.

They told me that people that come to purchase their cars, that no one cares how the car looks. So basically they are not concerned as to what kind of car they give you or how it looks and rides either.

The insurance that came with the booking, turns out is only for foreigners outside the country even though they don’t change the price charge. On top of that they make you buy Insurance of theirs and tell you the insurance you have doesn’t cover enough. I would go with the better by at another company next time.< /review>< rate>

I rented a car from them for one whole summer and the experience was bad to say the least. They lie about the prices when you call them. Once you reach to pick up the car, they bump up the prices and rip you off. Their customer service isn't too friendly either. I'm never going back to them.<//review>

Recently, I had a need to rent a car and instead of going to "run of the mill" rental companies, I decided to try Express - and I was more than pleased.  This was my second or third time renting here.  The paperwork was simple, staff was pleasant and attentive, car was clean and price was more than reasonable.  Now I feel like I have come to know this place.  I had recommended a friend of mine to rent a car here as well - and during his rental, he had an accident. Car rental people took care of the situation with very professional attitude and handled the insurance matters in a prompt and proper manner.

Will definately go there again when I need to rent the car!!!</Text>

<text>I had to rent a car, last minute, as my car was being repaired.  I called Express, the staff was friendly, got me a rental immediately, and got a great price.  When I picked up the car, it was just as described.  Would definitely recommend them to anybody looking for a rental in the San Diego area.  Excellent experience.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>I rented a car for 1 month. I had an issue with my driver's license in that it was going to expire in 8 days, and I was working on resolving that issue with the DMV. They were well aware of that issue, and said worst case scenario I could "just return the car when it expired." They had me pay for a month up front, because they claimed I had to "lock in the rate" and that it would be much more expensive to rent by the week. They did not tell me how much a weekly rental would cost, and did not present any other options for my situation.

When I got the car it only had 1/4 tank of gas so I went to fill up the gas tank. After filling up, it didn't start. I had to pump the gas pedal to get it to start. It did this again the 2nd time I filled the tank. After a few days of driving the car, all of the warning lights were on (tire pressure, air bags, check engine), and I no longer felt safe driving it around. It could break down at any minute.

I brought the car back a few days before my license was to expire, and it was then that they informed me they "don't do refunds" and all they could do was exchange the car. They did not have a decent car to give me in exchange. They ended up giving me the only other car on the lot with air conditioning, and every time you try to get in the car, the alarm goes off until you push a button and start it. I am not satisfied with this quality of exchange, and I also have the issue of my license to deal with. They tell me I can return the car and have a few days credited at the end for the few days I won't have a license. This is not a solution because I was also required to get a non-owner insurance policy, which is only good for 1 month.

I would like to simply return the car, which probably should not have passed inspection in the first place, and get some of my money refunded. I do not want an exchange because they do not have any reliable road-worthy cars. They should be ashamed of how they run the business. They are taking advantage of people in difficult situations without being up front about their policies. They are making promises that they cannot keep.</Review>< user_name>

<Review>To start off I usually don’t leave reviews unless I really need to but being that the service I received from the manager himself it was enough for me to write this.  I had heard about this place through a family member being that I didn’t have a credit card I was able to pay cash and use my debit card which was awesome.  Not even two days after driving the car and the battery was completely dead.  I had to walk to a store and buy jump starter cables, besides it not turning on the first time around the next few times I made stops it kept happening and had to keep jump starting the car; mind you this was all happening around 7-8pm.  The next day I called and made a complaint to let them to let them know what was wrong with the vehicle, missed my eye doctor appointment and a day of work and when I mentioned that to Jordan (manager) his response was quote on quote “well if that was so important, you should have taken an Uber or lyft.” Not only was I offended by what he had said but was furious due to them not checking their vehicles and making sure everything was in working condition.  Luckily they sent out a gentleman and switched the battery for me, who was completely cool and helpful; also very respectful.  The next day the brakes and the alignment on the car were also bad  and told them as well, I told them I wanted a refund for at least a day and was told that they don’t do refunds but offered me the vehicle for an extra day.  Honestly working in customer service never have I ever felt so disrespected by someone especially someone in a manager position.  I will not be doing business here again and hopefully someone from cooperate could get a hold of me instead of the douchebag manager I spoke with.  I guess you get what you pay for right?< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I rented a car for one month do do a road trip around California, Arizona and Nevada. Before renting the car I did not check the google references which was a mistake. Nonetheless everything went well.

I got a Toyota Camry which was in a pretty decent shape. When you do walk around the car just make sure that the manager really saves ALL the damages on the vehicule prior to the rental. Otherwise you'll end up paying for it. I even took pictures of the entire car (even underneath it) just to make sure that I'm backed up.

The trip was fine and returning the car was good too. However, I give this rental service only 4 stars because they don't allow their cars to Utah. If you're planning on seeing the Ojalito Monument Valley, Zion National Park etc. this is a problem. They were not very helpful when I called them to discuss the issue.

In case you want to rent a cheap car this is a good bet. Just make sure you don't wreck the car and absolutely make sure to document the state of the vehicule prior to renting it. I would rent with this company again however.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

(Summary: Bottom line is that the service with Express is not good. The case is now closed and the credit card company decided to recharge the fine Express tried to charge me for.
I d also like to inform readers that some of the reviews given here are written by employees from Express. You can check that out yourself on the internet. Most 5-star reviews here are traceable from Express!)

I rented a car here November, 2014, for 500USD (actually more than the price claimed on their website, but still one of the cheaper around San DIego).

The pickup service at San Diego Airport was nice. The car I got to rent was however not (completely bumped, making bad noises when braking), but maybe I could not expect more for the money.
I returned the car already after 1 out of 4 weeks, because I did not have to use it anymore and did not have a parking lot available for it. Express did not want to give me any refund, nor accepted the car when I wanted to return it without a completely filled tank. Although this is not very customer friendly, with me returning the car so early, I could still not complain until this point because this was something I had agreed on in the contract. My experiences so far however did make me not wanting to return to them in future.

Bigger problems started to arise after I returned the car. I got a mail from Express that I committed a toll violation in the LA region. They kindly informed me that they already paid for it, charged my credit card, and charged me a fine in addition for having been outside San Diego County. I had never agreed to pay for the ticket however.

Express could have known I had never been in LA: I only had driven 80 miles with the car, the place where the ''crime'' was committed being further away. Irrespective of that, they paid the ticket (taking away my right and possibility to dispute it!) and charged me a fine for having been outside San Diego County on top (60 dollar for the violation ticket, 100 dollar for having been outside SD County). This 100 dollar shows the incompetence of Express again: even if the car had been outside SD County, the 100 dollar that they charged me is based on nothing: according to the contract, a penalty of 25 cents per mile is given for driving outside SD. 100 dollar would mean 400 miles. I however only drove 80 miles with the car...... (which is in the contract, so Express knew about that).<//review>

NEVER TRUST THIS BUSINESS!

First, they tried to rent us a car with bald tires. I noticed and asked for a different car.
No problem, so we leave with the new car get about 3 hours away had to stomp on the brakes to avoid a car and the whole car VIOLENTLY VIBRATED. So we call and ask if we can take it to a shop to get it fixed at our destination. They're answer, NO! we won't help you. Even though we now know the brakes are unsafe. They're solution just drive extra slow. When you rent a car you expect it to be in a safe running condition.
Clearly that is not the case here.

Management OBVIOUSLY does not care about the safety of their customers.

Now my whole vacation will be inconvenienced by having to deal with an unsafe car.<//Text>

You deserve exceptional customer service and compassion with your insurance agency. You deserve an agent and team who are knowledgeable, trustworthy, and who look out for your best interest to protect what you have worked so hard for. I have had several State Farm agents in the past. Katie Brazil is hands down the best agent. When I moved from California to Nevada I had to temporarily switch to a local agent. The local NV agent messed up my account so bad I couldn't wait to switch back to Katie's office once Katie could write business in NV. Katie's office helped rewrite my policies the right way, took time to thoroughly review my account and even spent hours on the phone with DMV for me to fix an issue that I had. Katie and her team went above and beyond with a level of customer service that is unmatched by other agents. Shout out to Kendra and the rest of Katie's team for all their help. They are the best!</Text>

It is a rare thing to find quality customer service these days. Katie is one of the nicest people you will ever come in contact with in the insurance industry. Whenever I need something, I never have to wait long for response and action. I would recommend her to anyone I know. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication.<//Text>

<text>Katie Brazil and her associate, Kendra Salazar are the best I have worked with.  Super responsive and go the extra mile to answer questions and help you understand the options, rates and policy details.  Wish I had used them sooner.</text>< Date>

We were with another insurance company for years and never in that time did they contact us to review our policies so we left them, looking for someone in our area..  Katie Brazil had excellent reviews so I called to get a quote. It was much lower than what we were currently paying. She was very professional and responsive to our needs. Our renewal comes up next month and her office called to schedule an appointment to review all of our policies.  She spent a lot of time with us going over each policy and answered all of our questions.  We have our home, cars, boat, umbrella and earthquake policies with Katie and I would highly recommend her for your insurance needs.</text>

I switched to this office after many years with another broker and another company. The difference was immediate and positive, not to mention money-saving, and has continued in that realm over the last 18 months. Kendra Salazar has been my most constant contact.<//Review>

Katie and her group are proactive, responsive and helpful. They do not just leave me hanging out there because I do not have a claim or question. They check in to make sure I have the services I need and allow me the time to make the decisions I am comfortable with.</Review>

I have been State Farm customer for over 30 years.  While there may be less expensive insurance options available, none compare with the excellent customer service provided by State Farm.  Katie Brazil and her amazing team are extremely responsive and provide consistent and professional care for their customers.  Shout-out to Dede Davis - Katie's insurance specialist who does a fantastic job accommodating all my insurance needs and requests!!</Review>

Katie Brazil and her team are excellent! My husband and I searched for a good State Farm agent to work with in our area when we switched our insurance from another company.

Katie had outstanding online reviews, a big initial factor in contacting her. From our first conversation with her we have found her and her team to be knowledgeable, experienced, professional, personable, and responsive.  She has also gone above and beyond to suggest cost saving measures for us.

We feel fortunate to work with her and plan to continue working with her for our insurance needs. Thank you Katie and team!!<//text>

Has been our agent for about a year. Helped us get our account straightened out after changing states resulted in some oddities. The office was very responsive when we decided to get earthquake insurance. Katie had suggested it when we transferred our policy to her but we weren't in a position to take it on right then. They call me to "check in" far more than my past agent who I only had annual check-ins with. Overall good experience but I do ignore their calls when I'm at work.</text>

Great service from the whole crew at Katie Brazil's State Farm office.  We recently had a car crash.  It was resolved quickly, thoroughly, and with excellent financial results for us. We were given a fair, generous payment for our car plus they worked hard and quickly to make sure we had whatever we needed to be able to function and get it all resolved the best for us.<//review>

<Text>I have yet to have anything but a positive experience.  I recommend this particular State Farm office to many of my friends. I have both auto and renters insurance. If ever I have any questions, they are always there to help. Very polite and patient. I am very glad my daughter in law told me to give Katie Brazil's State Farm office a try. I too suggest doing so. Even if you are with a different agency now. It never hurts to shop around, and or update your insurance needs.< /Text>< Rating>

I was very pleased with Katie Brazil as a new client she is very personable and I will most likely return for renewal with her due to her honesty with respect to terms and conditions, all statements from her turned out truthful. She takes care of business and returns responses to questions with patience and understanding that the average "Joe" has a hard time understanding five stars all the way.<//Text>

Katie has been great working with me through every step of life, from a new driver, to a college student, post grad, and now life with kids I have always felt like I have had the perfect amount of coverage. Things go wrong, accidents happen and it’s nice to know you are well supported from this State Farm office. I have had a few minor incidents and Katie’s team has been helpful through the entire process and put my mind at ease every time.

Katie is also wonderful at providing really competitive rates without compromising coverage.  It is really comforting to work with someone that I trust to have my best intentions in mind. Above all, Katie and her team truly care about their clients. We love this office!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>I'd like to thank Mrs Brazil on her customer service and knowledge. I went in not knowing much about umbrella, life insurance and terms and basically most things insurance related. I left feeling safe with my coverages helping me protect my assets and my wellbeing. She sat and talked to me and felt like I was talking to a friend which is something I never experienced with an insurance agent before. She spoke in terms a layman like me could understand and was very patient. During a time of uncertainty she made me feel at ease. I wholeheartedly endorse her and will be referring friends and family to her.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1584392240379, 'text': "Elijah, we do things very differently here at our agency. Not only do we want our clients to be properly protected, we also strive to inform them of the risks they personally have. No person is the same and we want YOU to carry coverage that meets YOUR needs. I had a wonderful time meeting with you and helping you build the right policy package for you. We are lucky to have you! If there is anything else you need my team and I are here to help, we're just a call away!"}</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Thanks to Katie and her attentive team, I feel confident that I'm well-insured and well-informed of my insurance options. I scheduled a policy review with Katie 6 months after opening my insurance with her, and she talked through all of my options (present and future) for about an hour (on a Saturday, might I add). I'd highly recommend Katie's office for all insurance needs.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I had filed a claim through State Farm that ended up being very complicated and Dede at Katie Brazil's office was so helpful in getting it all figured out for me. She was able to answer all of my questions and even filed a claim for me through the other party's insurance. She definitely went above and beyond my expectations, as has Katie Brazil in the past with setting up my policies. I would definitely recommend this office.</Review>< Pictures>

Katie Brazil has been our State Farm Agent for many years. She discusses the options and presents the best policies for your needs. Because of the excellent rates and comprehensive coverage, we have life, home and auto insurance through State Farm. Anytime we have questions about anything, big or small, everyone in Katie's office is friendly and professional. I recommend calling Katie Brazil for all of your insurance needs.< /Review>

< review>
Extremely helpful and well organized. Was referred to this agency when my previous State Farm agent retired. Although I no longer live in Livermore, I feel no reason to switch to another agent because Katie and her team do such a good job, even from a distance. You get what you pay for: when you have State Farm, you have the expertise of an extremely well-trained agent and fully responsive staff. Although I have never had to file a claim, I am assured that if I have to do so everything will be handled competently and quickly. The peace of mind alone is worth so much more than any "savings" from discount or phone-based insurance providers.< /review>

Better get a good instructor- may be Dante and please read all the reviews every where before you head out. This is an awesome place. Dante is very awesome in taking pictures and videos of my husband's. Really recommend him. My instructor was Tim, he was good and was very careful but I am not satisfied with the videos and photos.  I didn't get so many candid pics.</Text>

From the office staff to the the tandem jump partner, they made me feel safe and special for my first jump ever. they are well organized and all of them are funny and help ease your nerves if you have any.
I'm recommending this place to everyone i know. they are the best in my opinion.<//Review>

Amazing experience with my group of friends jumping 15,000 feet with ocean views ending with a smooth landing.
The instructors were very vibrant and accommodating.
You can ask them anything before your jump :)
At the end of the jump they gave us a cute little surprise along with a free pen!
Loved it.
Would love to go back again!<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>The jump was amazing and the instructor with me (Dante) made the experience fun and helped me conquer my fear. I was VERY disappointed to make reservations with all my friends and have our group get split into 2 different planes cause the group before us had people not show up, but after the great experience, this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The lack of any safety videos or pre-jump training was a little unexpected.< /Review>< Pictures>

Went skydiving today for the 1st time for my bday. Booked last minute, literally an hour before my scheduled jump, and they were still able to get me in and match the Groupon price. Gave me a free bday shirt upon arrival which was so cool! I got some free stuff at the other places I went later bcuz I was still wearing the shirt! My instructor was amazing!!! Made me feel safe, secure and at ease. Such an incredible experience! Can’t wait to do it agin, it’s my new bday ritual!!!</Review>

A group of 6 of us jumped together this month. We all had SUCH a great time! GoJump was very well organized and extremely professional. The people we jumped with were all very experienced veterans with thousands of jumps under their belt. We felt completely safe and were free to just focus on the thrill of the jump. Our photos and video came out fabulous and are such great mementos of our epic experience. Everybody was super nice and we can't wait to jump again. Thank you for an awesome experience, GOJUMP!< /Text>

EXTREMELY disappointed!!! READ! READ! READ!
My group of 7 wanted to go celebrate a special birthday skydiving, since I’ve been here before I reccomended GoJump in Oceanside. We all agreed and very excited we all bought our Groupons which includes either photos and video for $199. As I was in charge of planning, I called to make the reservations and they tell me there will be an additional “deposit” of $60 in order to make the reservation. I said I’d have to check with my group so I called back and they gave me a different price for the deposit. I decided to have my friend call, maybe I was misunderstanding, she called and they gave her a different price for the deposit. I did read on the fine print on Groupon that it said,  “$50 refundable deposit required”, in order to reserve. I called and asked the gentleman that answered (David, guy with accent), if the $50 would be refunded when we checked in and he said no, so it’s not a deposit it’s an extra FEE, so I told him I would have to consult with the rest of the group and he offered to call me back in 15-20 min, he never called me back. I call again and another person answered and told me it would be $20 extra per person if we book for 9am instead of 3pm but since they were about to close he told me to call the following day, so I called today to reserve for 9am and now it’s $50 extra for anytime after that $80 extra instead of $50. I have no idea what’s going on, they keep changing the price to make a reservation.
WORST part of it all was this.....
When I called today David answered he gave me a higher price again and I told him he gave me a different price yesterday and told me he would call me back but never did. I asked him if I could please speak to his supervisor and he said very RUDE, “I am the supervisor”, so I went on asking to speak to his manager and again with a rude attitude said, “I am the manager”, so I asked to speak to anyone else but him and he YELLED AT ME, “no you can’t” I was in shock and disgust so I decided to hang up on him. That was extremely rude of him.
HORRIBLE customer service!
And I still don’t have a reservation.<//review>

<text>Honestly I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about waiting times and appointments, but we had a great experience. We had our appointment set for a group of 4 on a Friday at 10AM. We did not wait at all, and they got us set up and ready to go super quick. All the instructors are awesome and they made sure the entire group was having a great experience. This is a great place if it is your first time skydiving! Or even if its not still an amazing staff!</text>< Rate>

I’ve jumped about a dozen times (tandom) here and they have all been amazing. I volunteer for a nonprofit organization Soul Survivor Outdoor that jumps here quite often. Staff is very professional and really makes each jump memorable. Today’s jump was super rad and I definitely got to give a big shout out to instructor Eric. Definitely got radical up there today. So thanks brother.<//Text>

<review>Great place to jump and beautiful views of the ocean! Had an awesome camera man who made jumping sooo much fun. Had a little problem where my camera mans go cam didn't work so they couldn't recover my video I paid for which was disappointing, but I have to say the owner did a great job in making things right with me and refunded some of my money back! I would definitely jump again here!</review><user_id>107208130645282907074<//user_id><Rating>5</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dc702e7962ca9d:0xceed590d529b63a8< /Gmap_id><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<text>My son Bryan and I made a pact 15 years ago to go jumping. We finally did it and thanks to Jessie and Kate, our experiences were fantastic. Jessie, you are a beautiful Being. Thank you for taking great care and making the flight the most enjoyable I can imagine it could have been. Kate, Bryan sends similar regards. I also have to thank all the other crew members on the ground and in the air. Be Free!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Due to weather conditions my boyfriend & I were unable to jump. I recommend anyone looking to book, book an earlier time. We booked for 4 and unfortunately the clouds got to heavy. Although we were unable to experience skydiving, the owner and staff were extremely professional about the entire situation. The group that jumped before us looked happy, if you’re looking to skydive go here.<//review>

<review>I went a couple days after my 21st birthday, it was my first time going. I absolutely loved it!!! I did not feel nervous whatsoever due to the fact that the staff was so nice and energetic. While flying up they kept the conversation going making me feel reassured and once we jumped I loved the experience so much, the view was so amazing. I’m definitely going again!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This experience was truly AMAZING :) The staff, camera people, & other sky divers really made this a worthy moment in my life. "I can't wait to do this again".
A great comfortable environment. You may find it, life changing.<//review>

I jumped for the first time on my birthday with Glenn, who is the best!! He is caring, professional,and thorough, a great asset to the company. (Plus his photo poses are on point) The view is gorgeous...definitely a memorable experience and would recommend anyone to GoJump.
Oh, and a special shout out to Rob due to bad weather on the previous day I couldn't jump with him,but he is amazing and super fun to talk with!</Review>

<review>OMG I never imagined I would jump out of a perfectly good airplane, but I did and it was awesome. You need to do it to at least once in your life. The folks at GoJump Oceanside are absolutely amazing, and true professionals. We went there as a group of 30 + people and we were all safe and all happy and all terribly impressed with our jumping partners.</review>< Pictures>

<text>What an experience!! The guys at go jump are super professional but fun and light hearted at the same time. At no point was I concerned about my safety or well being. We went as a group of 5, we pre booked online and once we got there it was a smooth check in process. We booked our jump for 2pm and were harnessed and ready to jump within half hour of our jump time. You have the option of paying extra for hand cam footage OR having an extra diver jump with you filming the entire jump for you. ($98 for hand cam & $128 for the extra diver). The jump itself was phenomenal. Seeing the ocean and skyline was absolutely breathtaking!! It was about 5ish mins in total. Be prepared to have a bit of ear pain on the decent, but once your ears pop your good to go!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in going skydiving. You're in good hands at go jump!<//text>< pictures>

< review>
We had such a great time skydiving with GoJump Oceanside!! I went with my mom, brother, and friend who was the only person in our group who had completed a jump before. Our original booking was for a Sunday, however we weren’t able to jump because of the marine layer, which was still thick at 3pm. We rescheduled for 2 days later at 1pm. We arrived at 12:45pm and ended up jumping at 6:00pm. This was because of the same marine layer issue and it being a semi cloudy day. The staff were very friendly and great with keeping us informed and honest with their predictions on if there were going to be jumps that day. We ate lunch and spent most of our time at the humane society next door (and even adopted and took home a cat 🤷🏼‍♀️) after we got the call we were suited up and in the air within 45 min. The plane ride to reach 13,000ft took about 10 min and everyone was out very quickly after that! My instructor, Matt, was knowledgeable, safe, and made sure I was comfortable starting on the ground before we boarded the plane all the way until we were back on the ground after the jump! My mom’s instructor, Rob, was hilarious and a pro with getting great footage not just of her but of our whole group as well. It was an overall great experience and it definitely will not be my last jump!< /review>

I like to start all my reviews with 5 stars and after the experience I rate and update. I have an appointment for tomorrow at 10am. To celebrate my husband's Armando birthday 🎂 💖 I hope all of the good reviews are true!! And we can enjoy tomorrow. I bought Groupon for $199.00. Paid $50.00 Deposit due back to me after the jump per appointment coordinator. So far so good. I'll leave a yelp review as well 😀 and update that one too.UPDATE:FRIENDLY,FAST,DID NOT WAIT MORE THAN 50 MINS. THEY HAVE A WAITING SECTION. THEY SELL MINI ICECREAMS INSIDE,AND FREE WATER. CLEAN PLACE AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO FAMILY & FRIENDS. LOVED IT.</text>

I took my wife here for her birthday. It was the first time for both of us after talking about it for years. Every staff member was friendly and welcoming. The instructors we had were Irish and Adrian. Both were knowledgeable and fun!  They made the experience amazing!  We’ll definitely be back!< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Not sure how all the reviews are positive. Its actually mind boggling.

This was super sketchy.

Felt like I was going to die the entire time.

We had a 10 year old boy giving us our safety briefing.

Not only that but we showed up there and had to pay an additional $300 on top of the $400 we already paid through Groupon.

Even my jumper dude told us how terrible / shady the management is.

Not sure about you but I know I don't want to go to a place where the guy attached to me is telling me the management does everything they can to cut costs, and they cut corners wherever possible.

What a horrible experience this was< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The jump was fun but the guy won't give you a receipt to see why he overcharges you and keeps your deposit.

These guys don't know anything.  I am a C license skydiver with over 350 jumps and was told since I had only made 7 jumps in the past 12 months and not 12 jumps in 12 months that I was not current.  Clearly they don't know the currency requirements in section 5 of USPA SIM that C and D license jumpers need to make at least 1 jump every 180 days to stay current.  Hate to leave bad reviews but skydiving is a community clearly these guys don't want anyone who is not in the "clique" jumping.  If you are looking to travel to DZ's outside of your home DZ stay away from this company.  Rude and does not even know the rules in which they operate under. The uspa probably needs to do an examination of the "qualified" staff working here<//Review>

<text>This was the experience of a lifetime. I was nervous going into it, but my instructor, Glenn, was super informative. He walked me through the entire process and made me feel a lot more confident/comfortable. I would HIGHLY recommend it, even if you're afraid of heights. You won't regret it.< /text>< pics>

It was my second jump and the staff were super friendly and helpful. My tandem instructor was Kale, and he was amazing! There was a slight mixup between me and someone else who had a very similar name. We had purchased different packages, so I didn't get what I paid for. We were going to ask for a refund of the difference between packages, but the lady went above and beyond and completely made my day. I would definitely jump with these guys again.< /review>< Pics>

After having to reschedule due to the rain back in February, we went out on Sunday and showed up at our appointed time of 1 hour 15 mins before. Weather was a little sketchy- rain was gone but there was plenty of clouds. It ended up causing us to wait for 4 hours before flying, but let me tell you, it was absolutely worth it! Our tandem instructors treated us very well and had some nice personal touches to our videos/interviews. J.C. was great! Even the lead manager guy (forgive me I didnt get his name) tried to keep us all well informed about the weather and flight status. Will definitely come back again!< /text>

Everything is organized very well.
I enjoyed a lot this trip, no words to say how I felt during the jump and after the opening of the paracadute..
Thanks a lot and I will sure come back, when I’ ll come again in California from Rome Italy.. 🇮🇹 🇺🇸<//Review>< Pics>

This is toward the end of a long day.  I could easily see the whole crew was tired, but they kept the energy up as much as could be expected.  I give them a thumbs up!

To all the complaints....

This is the beach.  Ocean layer is a thing.  If you book for 10 am, and there are clouds until 11, you EXPECT to wait for 2 more hours.  This is safety, and common sense.  Bring a snack, sack lunch, or go get food.  This is a real thing people.

Again, kudos to Felix.  He handled everything excellently, took great photos, and made the glide and landing comfortable.</Text>< pictures>

We used GoJump Oceanside after reading the Google reviews and decided it was perfect for us even though we drove from Los Angeles.

The reservation process online was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful  Accommodating a big group on inexperienced jumpers.

Understandingly with a larger group we had a slight wait but jumping over Oceanside was so beautiful words aren't enough. You gotta try it out for yourself.

I will definitely be back and refer my friends.
My instructor Brad was awesome, fun and knew what he was doing and how to show me all I needed to know to have an amazing experience . Thank You Brad and crew for another great memory.< /review>< Pictures>

We had the worst experience of our lives.

Never again.

This was not our first skydiving experience.
But it was certainly our worst skydiving experience BY FAAAAAR

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

I'm in the hospitality business and GoJump Oceanside is doing everything right. From the heartwarming smiles of the customer reps to the attentive caring instructors, you are set to receive a high quality experience. I couldn't ask for a better skydiving experience. A perfect view of southern California, the beaches, the pacific ocean and later in the evening, the sunset. Absolutely stunning. A must go if you are in Southern California.<//text>

<text>Took my husband here for his 65th birthday and he said it was one of the best experiences of his life. My mom jumped too for her 70th birthday. You have to arrive a bit too early so you sit around for a couple hours. You can watch the video of your jump immediately after landing. That’s probably the highlight for the spectators. We’ll definitely go back.</text><userid>100486153509739510536</userid>< GmapID>

<review>The first time we went we couldn't jump because of bad weather. waited 6 hrs :-( the next time we went we jumped in less than an hour of arrival. Rob was funny, friendly and great. He made me feel comfortable. Only thing I would say is ask the person if they want the parachute to twirl around. I got bit of a motion sickness at that point. overall great experience. thanks to Rob and GoJump.<//review><Date>1561960661817< /Date>< GmapID>

Beware - unprofessional staff, rude and arrogant! I skydived here around mid-Jan 2020 and my tandem skydiver, JC, was extremely rude, arrogant, condescending, and impatient. He made several cocky and snide remarks, and was very impatient at explaining basic procedures to me. When I asked him to repeat something since he was talking too fast, he replied something to the effect of "why don't you look here instead of listening". That is just one account of his misbehaviour. In short, if I were to make an analogy, he was one of those people who looks at you up-down, sizes you up, and then decides on the appropriate tone of voice and demeanor to direct at you.

I actually feel sorry for such people. In their conduct, they reveal how full of anger, fear, and insecurity they are deep down inside. Any individual who is grateful for life and humble would never behave in this manner...

Besides him, even in general, the staff is extremely unprofessional. They're basically young people (not that I have anything against young people. Also, JC mentioned above was much older, by the way) who have not been given training in customer service, how to behave and conduct themselves in front of clients, etc. I heard several of their staff regularly using the F-word and making misogynistic comments. Some of their customers had come there with the families and little children, so I'm sure they would have found such conduct objectionable as well.

After a jump, I also overheard the staff discussing technicalities of skydiving (which apparently were not performed well-enough the last time), which does not inspire confidence among customers who are right there listening to all that.

Finally, I paid extra to have my video edited and in the video they sent me, my voice is not audible and there is background music playing over it...

All in all, a very bad experience. Ruined my whole day. I had to go for dinner in the evening after the skydiving, and didn't even enjoy myself there because of the horrible skydiving experience.

If you're planning to go here, I would advise you to avoid JC as your tandem skydiver at all costs! Or better yet, I would avoid this place altogether...<//Text>

First time jumper and can't wait to go again. Megan at the desk (and on the phone) was super helpful. Danny prerigged us and got us pumped for our trip. Chris was my guy and he made sure I had the ride of my life! As my two boys have both already jumped it was only my youngest and I who hadn't checked this off the bucket list but her sister and Mom joined us.  The family that jumps together - has a blast!

You know you want to do it.  GoJump Oceanside is the place to do it.  The view out over the ocean & back over land to the mountains can't be described in words so get over there now and experience it for yourself.  You'll be stoked you did.</Text>

Life changing!. AMAZING EXPERIENCE....My wife and I put this on our list to do 13 years ago and I got this for her birthday. The entire staff was amazing. We did have to reschedule a couple of times  due to the weather but that's mother nature and it's safety first. The staff was amazing and super accommodating. Our skydiver Mikey Max and Ian were awesome. They guide you the entire step of the way. One of the great things i noticed was that the entire staff is like a family and brings the best energy to everyone there.. making a crazy thing like skydiving into an amazing experience. A special thanks to Mikey Max took the time to chat with us and made us comfortable and shared some cool stories. (Thanks brother) Another great shout out and thank you to Emma that was super gracious and so pleasnar ans sweet with rescheduling us and always positive. (Great team members) My wife and I got the pictures and the video and it was so worth it. The jump was amazing and unforgettable however coming home and seeing them after the jump..made it that much more special..we are totally doing it again and not waiting 13 years to do it this time..maybe a few months..😁<//Text>

<review>Birthday wish list granted. Entire staff was great, wonderful, and very very experienced in what they do. Rocco (my tandem jump guide) was great, funny and very professional. If you want to experience a life changing event, take a dive with Rocco.< /review><rate>5< /rate>< Name>

I jumped in Oceanside last May and my instructor Adrian was awesome.
Alas, since Mike Vetter, the owner, terminated most of his seasoned instructors who had thousands of jumps under their belt(or they quit) most of his instructors have been replaced by a few with a couple of hundred jumps under their belt. Scary, when you are jumping out of an aircraft at thirteen thousand feet.
Mr Vetter is also known for employing illegal immigrants, so are you going to trust someone who does that?  Mike's goal is money, NOT your safety.
And if you want a refund on damaged media, forget it!!
They have screwed over lots of people so with all the drop zones in southern Cali, do yourself a favor and jump where the owner follows all safety(and legal) rules! Adrian still rocks! If you want a skydiving company that lies to their customers on a daily basis, then this is the place for you! Cheers! Know this, ALL Mike Vetter cares about is your money, NOT your safety, they keep OS Police Department very busy with instructors landing "off"< /text>

Great first experience skydiving. Desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Went to eat while we waited, the actual ascent and jump was spectacular. I would definitely go here again. Picture and video coverage is also very thorough so you can capture those moments before during and after.</review>

Skydiving was the best experience ever!  I came with a small group.  I would have given 5 stars, but it would have been nice if the people up front would direct us where to go after checking in as well as instructions on what to do before jumping or at least during the landing (maybe an instructional video that loops while you're waiting).  You can't really hear that well when you're falling from the sky! 😂 As for my instructor,  he was sweet, except I wished he showed more of the experience in my video-- compared to what my friends had in their videos.</Review>

My name is Lana and I jumped today with gojump oceanside. Shout out to Tommy he's an amazing instructor who made sure I was comfortable, safe, and had a great time, he constantly checked on me, made sure I was okay and was very friendly and professional,

I recommend him for your jump. My experience was unreal, beautiful and breathtaking. DK is an awesome photographer and he'll make sure your pictures and videos will be taken at every moment.

Special thanks to Benny at the desk for assisting me with the photo and video selection I appreciate your superb customer service

What I liked about paying for both the photos and videos options is that you get to select all the pictures and videos that were taken and not just a bunch,

and that's why it's worth it to pay the extra for the entire content. I came here intending to buy only videos and ended up pretty much purchasing the entire picture and video package because of how great it turned out. Additional thanks to the friendly and cooperative ladies at the front desk

I look forward to receiving the content and thanks again for a beautiful experience<//Review>

< Review>
We travel 3 hours for this experience and paid for a hotel over night to make the skydiving an event. The company canceled on us 1 hour before our jump. We rescheduled, they cancel 48 hours ahead, which was a bummer but better. We rescheduled, travel into town again, they schedule us for 3pm, push back our time throughout the day and then cancel us at 4:30 when they promised is a 5PM jump. Unprofessional and disrespectful.</Review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1558875973334, 'text': "Hi Ashley,\nFirst off we would like to thank you for wanting to jump with us in the first place. Skydiving is an incredible sport and our goal is to share that with as many people as possible with a safe and incredible experience! Unfortunately, there are a few things that effect the safety of our favorite outdoor sport that are beyond our control- weather is one of them. Transition seasons (spring and fall) can sometimes bring a marine layer that will sit over the water and can move in and sit on top of our airspace making it unsafe to jump. Sometimes it clears up within minutes, sometimes it comes in and out, sometimes it sits there all day. Because the marine layer depends on outside versus water temperatures, they aren't on weather radars as clouds and can be very hard to predict or track. We do our absolute best to keep each of our customers informed as soon as we make decisions based on weather. Sometimes we nail it but other times the weather does something we didn't predict. Unfortunately those days you picked to jump, the weather wasn't operational. We do our best to let you guys know as soon as we know what's going on but sometimes we don't predict fast enough and I extend our apologizes for that. We know it can be frustrating to have your hopes set on jumping, make plans and organize travel to have weather stand in your way. We promise that if we could control it, it would be sunny all day long! :) On your rescheduled day we pushed your time back because the clouds were in and out all day and we landed a few airplanes without even dropping the jumpers. At a certain point, the clouds came back in and never went back out and that's when we inform all the customers. We apologize for the frustration and hope you guys are able to pick a beautiful sunny day to visit us and have the experience of a lifetime!"}< /response>< GmapID>

One thing that I hadn't expected was the pain in my ears during the free fall due to the change in altitude. It stopped once the chute opened and our descent slowed. I would still jump again but would see if there was a way to stop the pain.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

They took very meticulous care and attention to safety and made sure we were ready and prepared for the jump.

You don't get the ocean view too often for a skydive and it was all worth the price of the jump alone.

All in all I'd definitely come back for another jump.< /text>< Rating>

Very good experience, my wife and I had a blast skydiving for the first time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when we got there to jump, everything was extremely rushed, including the safety briefing. Literally all they told us is “hold onto your straps and act like a banana when we jump.” I suppose it is as simple as that, the tandem instructor does all of the work...but there was still a lot that wasn’t explained.</review>

From someone who is afraid of heights and doesn't like rollercoasters, let me just tell you, it was an amazing experience! A must for sure! The views on this beautiful day were breathtaking! Seeing the snow called mountains and seconds later seeing the beautiful ocean from that vantage point was just a magical experience. I can see why people can get addicted why the instructors love skydiving. Definitely worth getting every video and picture, especially if you think you'll only do it once. Can't wait to see my photos and videos!<//Text>

I’ve been jumping at this drop zone for years. The family atmosphere and the people are my favorite thing about this place! Mike Vetter truly cares about all of us and I’m happy to bring my business to GoJump Oceanside and send anyone I know to this fabulous establishment. Come check it out! Whether you’re interested in your first tandem jump or fun jumping your face off this is the place in SoCal!</review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! BUt that is because I was Skydiving which is fun irrespective.

GoJump Oceanside usually cramps up 10 pairs of people for tandem jumping into a small aircraft. So, it got hard for me to breath while the plan was taking off and during the flight. I was able to catch my breath comfortably only when I was ready to jump.

This is something to look into. Other than that, they have been pretty awesome.<//Review>< Pics>

Second time jumping. Both experiences were amazing. First time with Keith and this time with Brad and Dan they were so awesome to me and my best friend.  I bought a gift certificate for my bfs birthday and he absolutely had the time of his life. Can't wait for the next one!<//Text>

I love this location for sky diving as you get to see the ocean and it's even fun to see the fwy as you come in for a landing.  While I didn't get to jump the second time I was here, it  was nice to see that the planes were bigger since the last time I jumped.  Great crew that knew what they were doing.<//Review>

Less than one star would be better. Horrible customer service. Overbooked day but attributed to weather. Yes, morning was overcast and schedule pushed back but knowing that,  and knowing plane capacity and time per trip, why continue to book customers throughout the day,   knowing it would leave customers left out? Our group was scheduled for 12pm but that was pushed back to 3pm. Customers were not notified until arrival and are continually told another hour... another hour... another hour.... at 7PM, still no announcement when i  had to ask if another plane was going up and was told no. And no announcement was made. First the reason was that the pilot wasn't going up again, that changed to FAA regulations. So half the group did not get to go,  although later customers in small groups were taken ahahead of us. Shame on GoJump!< /Text>

Three words to describe GoJump: Careless, thoughtless and incompetent. Not a great combination for a sky diving business.

Similar to others' experience, their operation is poorly run with no customer service: they basically could give two flying you-know-what about the customer. I'll give it to them that they did so with a smile.

We booked a reservation, left work early, drove two hours from OC and arrived 15 minutes before our schedule appointment. When we arrived, they told us that the wait was 2.5 hours. They have our email and phone number and it didn't occur to them to let us know. The fog kept rolling in and they still encouraged patrons to "wait and see another 30 minutes", it was dusk by then and they had two more planes to go up.  I figure if this is a well established, expert shop, they would at least understand weather trends and let their appointments know that the jumps have been pushed back and begin your reschedule people. We understood weather is unpredictable and safety is the number one priority. But that does not give a business the excuse to operate in a fashion where they clearly do not care about the customer or their time. Needless to say, they called the day and we never went up. We wasted 5 hours and a half of tank of gas (plus tolls).<//review>

Was there last weekend 07/22/2017.  The jump was amazing , my instructor Joe was great and I felt very safe with him, I felt he made efforts to made me feel comfortable.
We had to great like one hour but not big deal. I hope they fix the 'managment' issues the seem to have because other than that the place and location is great</review>

Its very rare when I do this, but this experience had to shared. It was a friend's bday and he decided to go skydiving. We went with a group of 5, it was amazing!!!!!!! INCREDIBLY AMAZING DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT. My instructor or the guy strap to me that made sure I didn't die, his name was John, incredible person beautiful spirit had jokes so I was calm through everything. It was just a beautiful experience. Recommending Go Jump to everyone I know and also showing off my video its an experience they will not forget. Now I can tell my husband "yes babe angels do fall from the sky 😉" he did it too fyi he loved it he was terrified it haunted him for about a month but he did it I'm so proud of him ☺</review>

<review>Do not skydive here!!! They will waste your time.

I flew in from Denver to skydive at Gojump.
We checked in at around noon and were told to come back at  1:45 ( even though we had an aapt). After coming back we waited for 2.5 hours only to be told at 5pm that due to the weather they would not be flying anymore- Although they close at 5 so I question if it was really the weather or just the fact that they were done for the day.
Since I flew in from Denver for this, I asked if they could give me a special deal or some type of offer for the time wasted (5 hours) and they said there was nothing they could do for me. I asked to speak to the owner (Mike) and was told that he was not there but it was a lie he was behind the counter.
I understand weather changes happen but I did not appreciate the fact that they did not appreciate me as a customer or the time I wasted.
DO NOT SKYDIVE here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The they will waste your time!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//review>< rate>

Before going, I read a few of the comments. Doing that before our trip gave me a sense of what to expect. We were delayed because of weather, but because I read about the possibility, I wasn't that concerned. The staff was great especially our instructors, Kevin and Ian! Great experience!!!< /Text>

<review>The EPIC thing I never ever did before! Thanks to my instructor Ian, very nice and patient , help me to finish this challenge. Since it was sunny, we didn't encounter any delay. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes from preparation to landing. I will definitely recommend my friends to come here and at that time I will come back again!  Peace< /review>< pics>

Skydiving crew is amazing, but I would never pay a penny to this establishment. It's all about the almighty dollar, which is not what you want when your life is in someone's hands. I at least expected professionalism. We sat for 4 1/2 hours, being strung along, with staff telling us to check back every 30 minutes, and yet we never got to jump. The owner was at the desk, and didn't even apologize. He was arrogant and rude. Go somewhere else to jump.< /review>

All the staff were stellar, from booking, to flying, and after service. Did the right thing to book my first jump with this company. Arrived there at 10:40, got in plane at exactly 11:00, flight for 15-20mins then jump. Best adventure ever, not even a pinch of pain, no relapse or whatnot, just hangover with euphoria haha. Everything was phenomenal! Maxim was a rockstar on air, he made it blissful and extremely fun, his directions were all clear. Luke was very warm, he made me feel like we’ve known each other for a very long time and I love it. He gave the best outside shots I could ever hope for. Check out my IG video: annedexionary

Will definitely jump again with them both and will even be prepared for 50% tip next time. Those awesome men deserve it.<//review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Amazing experience,  just be prepared to wait a long time for your turn. We had a 3pm reservation,  but had to wait 2 hours before we actually jumped. That wait was with NO weather,  or mechanical delays. Kind of a let down considering I had to cancel plans later in the day to accommodate the wait. Overall, the jump was worth the wait.  My jump instructor was very nice and I felt safe jumping with him. Make sure to get pictures and video because it goes by so fast,  you'll want something to look back at and remember.<//Review>< pics>

Service is hit and miss, some are extremely friendly and do there best to make sure you have the ultimate experience, others don't care whether you live or die and treat you like you don't exist... Unless you are getting a very good rate, I'd look elsewhere.  If it hadn't been for the two people that really did put effort into their job (the two guys that I actually jumped with) I'd give this place a lower rating.  Thanks to them my experience was salvaged, I almost cancelled the jump.  You'd think a place that holds your life in their hands would take better care of their customers.  The name of the game here is get your money, not love of the game.< /Review>

This was flippin amazing! ASK TO JUMP WITH TOMMY!!! All of the GoJump employees are down to earth, knowledgeable, & energetic (with the exception of the front desk ladies who seemed hella stoned and mis informed us on basic information) but Tommy (my guide) was a step above the rest, simply put, hes amazing. He was respectful and kind, always made sure to check in and make sure I was feeling right, as I'd imagine adventures such as these can be overwhelming to some. On the way up he took the time to scream over the plane engine and point out different sights around San Diego such as the La Jolla coves, Catalina island, Coronado, etc. He verbally walked me through each step along the way so I was prepared and not caught off guard, which in turn made me feel safe. My friend did not get the same experience with her guide which makes me all the more confident when I tell you to ASK TO JUMP WITH TOMMY. Sky diving at GoJump is absolutely worth the time & money. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and having a guide such as Tommy made the experience unforgettable from beginning to end. I gave 5 stars despite the misinformed stoney twins at the front desk cause the prep, the ride, the jump and the guide (TOMMY) made up for the 5 mins of confusion. Keep doing what you're doing guys 🤙Aloha<//Text>

Jumped on a beautiful sunny day at Gojump in Oceanside today. We had to wait about an hour and 45 to have the sky clear up but overall the experience was great. The instructors were friendly, helpful, and engaging. Jesse is a great instructor and I felt like my life was in good hands, lol. Definitely a memorable experience and would recommend anyone to GoJump.< /Review>

Bad business! We had reservations to jump at 5 p.m. today. You called and canceled due to weather. We were already on our way to Oceanside when you called. It turned out to be a beautiful day, sun is shining and the sky is almost clear. Come to find out, you guys are still operating taking the earlier reservations in our place. That doesn't seem right. The earlier reservations should be rescheduled and we should be able to keep our reservations. We have two people that had to build up the nerves to do this and two people who traveled from Colorado to have the ocean view experience. Very disappointing!<//Review>

In their confirmation email, they should alert you to take antihistamines so your ears don’t burst especially in the flu/cold season   My ears  killed me the whole way down. Also freezing temperature. You should be allowed to cover ears somehow. My one lobe was swollen for hours. Also my tandem mate never warned me about difficulty breathing; other instructors told their flyers to scream first 10-15 seconds to get used to thin oxygen and breathing. I struggled first 15 seconds without any verbal aide. I think my guy is just over taking people up.< /Review>

I pre paid for my partner and I to go skydiving, we repeatedly had to cancel due to delays related to weather. My partner & I decided that we would like to be refunded, & we're assured that we would be.  Since then, I was refunded my initial deposit. After that, I reached back out to the business to request my full refund (I am still owed $298).

The owner mike (who has been extremely unresponsive) initially said that he tried to refund my card but was unable to get the refund to process successfully.  After waiting for quite some time, I told mike that I would be filing a complaint if I was not refunded. He then assured me that he would be sending a check out. I waited again, didn't receive anything, reached back out to mike & have not heard back. I also emailed the business to request the business license number 3 weeks ago and have not heard back.

I've been trying to handle this matter since September 24 2017 (almost 1 year). My experience with mike & go jump oceanside has  been extremely negative. I am very concerned about their business practices & feel that they have handled this process very irresponsibly.<//Text>

All safety measures and precautions are taken, so there is no complaint about that from me. I appreciate that they don't take risks with safety. However, as many of the other reviews have mentioned, GoJump does not value the customer's time. They canceled our first appointment without notifying us, and we only found out after making the long drive down to the area. We rescheduled twice after that, and they were extremely inflexible about times. We had booked our first reservation about a month in advance, so they should have been more accommodating with their times.

The third reservation we booked was at 5 pm.  Remember, the time is booked with the assumption that you're actually going to be getting on the plane pretty soon after that time. We called at 3 to confirm that they were still on, and all seemed well. We arrived at 4:45 pm to be told that there was a 2 hour delay. We waited for an hour and 20 minutes, and then they canceled the rest of the jumps due to weather. There was no compensation for our wait, drive, or the inconvenience of constantly rescheduling.

Again, I'm glad that they don't try to force jumps in bad weather conditions, but this inefficient scheduling is ridiculous. I can't imagine trying to do this on a vacation with limited time. If you're really set on using this company, I'd suggest to book your reservation in the middle of the day and then plan to make it a full-day commitment.

When we finally did get to jump, it was truly an amazing experience. The tandem pilots are great and seem really focused on making sure you're comfortable.

In all, I think the office should be more organized and helpful. I think the best way to ensure your jump the first time is to schedule it for late morning or early afternoon. Thank you.</review>

<Text>I purchased tickets through a third party and they confirmed with me that day that the jump was still on. I arrived at GO JUMP and they informed me all jumps had been cancelled. I requested my money refunded and instead of giving me the run around. They not only contacted the third party but wrote and signed a document stating that I be refunded, due to no fault of my own. I recieved an email that same day from the third party stating that my money was being refunded. These are good people</Text><Date>1487954760964<//Date>< rate>

<Text>I thought it was crazy. The plane turned around to chop us up while we flew through the air, and the skydiving guide pulled out a gun shooting the plane down. Crazy Cool!!!!

I highly recommend jumping to everyone.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>If it is your first time going skydiving and you would like to tandem skydive, I would recommend buying your ticket on Groupon. It is much cheaper. They are very nice people. It is usually somewhat crowded but the wait to go up is 30 minutes or less. The planes are always taking off to drop a new load of sky divers. They fully answer any questions you have and have great package deals for those who love skydiving. The area is calm. However, parking isn't that great. They also sell food outside while you wait. If you just want to watch, they have an area outside to watch.
Now when you go on the plane, they take you over the ocean. The instructors have GoPros to record every moment.
Appointments are required to secure your spot. They will cancel and reschedule due to weather. Make sure you check the weather if you don't wish to get an email or a call about them having to reschedule due to the weather.<//Text>< Date>

GO JUMP this experience was amazing, but what I will say it that they are not on schedule, when you check in, & the young lady that checked us in was extremely RUDE, but once we jumped our institutor * Danny* partner was amazing  & so nice & made me feel so comfortable. this is a MUST DO!<//review>

UPDATE: Mike the owner contacted me personally to apologize and was nice enough to give me the option of my money back or to redo the experience....of course I prefer redoing it!
Can’t wait to go back! Thanx again for the generous offer, I will see you soon!

First time skydiving long story short...waited over 2 hours after being told 30 minutes...worst part 3 days after I finally called to see what happened with my pictures and video...to come to find out they lost it....?
You can't take back a first time experience like this....want to see if they makeup for it.

1 star goes to Becca for being an amazing instructor with a great personality! Thanx Becca</text>

BE AWARE: Even if you make an appointment online and come 15 minutes your scheduled appointment, YOUR STILL GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT 1 to 2 HOURS BEFORE GOING. When you come in you sign a waiver and ypu head to the desk to check ID and pay, not once did they ever ask you what time is your appointment. You could have been just driving by and you wanted to go sky diving so you come here, meanwhile there is someone who booked their jump at the same time, if they get there before you then too bad they go first. This is something that has to get fixed right away. When you schedule a reservation for a jump at a time you should be jumping at that time not 2-3 hours afterwards.<//text>

The wait is way too long. Employees lie and say the wait is one hour. We waited 3 hours before going to the desk and asking what was going on. We were told we’d go up in 15 minutes. She lied. We waited another hour and a half.<//review>

I arrive at the town at 1pm then they call me and tell me it's been pushed to 5pm. Then I wait till 5 and I get there. Then they tell me they are not flying at all today because their ONLY plane is broken....

I drove 6 hours to get here and wasted another 3 hours in the empty town thanks to this place.

They did not provide any compensation other than a "sorry"</text>

Very bad customer service. Never return calls, never respond on emails. Reschedule 3 times tandem jump over 3 weeks period. Last time without notice and I call a hour ahead and they confirm it will be jump as booked by schedule.
Not recommended. If you want spend a lot of your time for nothing go to GoJump.
Beside that Groupon NON REFUNDABLE but representative told me it is.
Unsatisfying and bad experience.< /Text>

It's a once in a lifetime experience. The skydive itself was incredible. But I'm only giving GoJump three stars because we have waited for almost half a day despite booking beforehand. We've booked a dive at 12 noon but we did not jump until 5 pm. We arrived at the place 15 to 12 and we were told that there's a lot of people jumping that day so we should go back at 2 pm. So we had some snacks first and went to the beach and came back but was told to wait another 45 minutes... and another 40 minutes... then finally we were called but we waited for the helicopter for some more minutes. But dive was so worth it that I forgot all the complaining I did for three hours.<//review>

Why is there even an option to make an appointment?

We made our appointment for 2PM, showed up 20 minutes prior to be told it would be about an hour wait. At 3PM, we inquired about an update and was told it would be another 25 minutes or so. Finally, at 4PM, the staff said that it did not look like we would even be able to go up in the air. We were offered a refund but this was after driving an hour to get there, two hours twiddling our thumbs in a tent outside, and now another hour drive back to our hotel. A refund is not going to give me back a full day wasted on my vacation. Very disappointed.</Text>

<time>1529873825355<//time><Text>Such nice people. We went on June 23 @ 10:00. Unfortunately we had June gloom. It wasn't expected to burn off until 2ish. We could have waited but decided to reschedule for another time. There has to be clear skies over the jump zone. I went with a Groupon and was concerned that it would be a problem. It's not. We will reschedule for sometime in July so my nephew can go for his 18th birthday. We did not have to pick a date right then. .....BTW. we're glad we did not wait. It ended up not burning off till late afternoon.</Text></record>

Felt a little skeptical about this place because of the mixed reviews. But besides that the place was really good. Front desk didnt give me any issues about my Groupon, they even let me jump 30 minutes before my actual scheduled time. The dive itself was amazing and totally worth the drive and money for that view. Instructors were very nice and enthusiastic. Would defiantly go again. I went on a Friday and only had one plane ahead of me so I was done within an hour.</Review>

We spoke with the manager, and when we asked him about why his workers are giving us very poor customer service, he said "I'm a free man. You can' t tell me what to do."

We drove 3 hours from LA and waited for 3 hours. At 6 pm, we were told that we couldn't jump due to the weather. Which is fine, but when we asked the manager (very nicely) is it possible to give us an incentive to come back (a video or something), he was so condiscending and keep saying "I don't understand why would I do that".
He made it a very easy decision to get a refund.

If you go, hope you get to jump (booking earlier in the day if possible), because dealing with the manager would not be pleasant.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

It sad that companies like this are not avaliable to give their services.
In first place they send me to breakfast for the cloudy day, it's OK, I understand that but after that they told me that my family and I have to wait cause the don't have a good plane, ok again, I wait 3 hours just to they told me that it doesn't work so they can't do anything.
They not offer a discount, anything.
Hope that they can fix this.<//Review>

<review>Disgusting experience with go jump. Wasted a whole day of my vacation... Drive so many hours to get there for them to tell us the jump is cancelled after delaying it without even calling us and notifying. The staff is lacking experience. The owner has zero business experience and seems to have the mindset that the customer can be wrong.</review><Date>1498418794094</Date>< Pics>

<review>The actual jump was amazing but the people behind the desk were extremely rude. I booked my jump through Groupon and thought i was purchasing the jump for $50,but the wording was deceiving. I also bought the video & pic package but felt I was missing some shots. I called and the girls who picked up were extremely rude and kept passing the phone to a different person because they didn't want to deal with me. The first time I called the girl said they were too busy to explain my concern over the phone and would have someone call me back and explain it. She didn't ask me for my number or name. I called a second time and the girl who picked up passed the phone to a different girl because she didn't want to deal with my concern. Don't get me wrong, i had an amazing experience, but they need to replace the people who handle their phone calls.<//review>< UserId.>

GoJump Oceanside is the best place to skydive in So. Cal. Beautiful views, fast planes, great instructors for tandems and mostly freefly and wingsuit fun jumpers.</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>My wife and I were extremely shocked at the customer service here. We work extremely hard all year for our annual vacation and this place ruined a big part of it. The blonde chick at the desk was being extremely rude. They did not send out an email or call for cancelling our jump and tells us to talk to the manager I think his name was MIke? Or Michael. Mike is probably the worse business owner I've ever encountered. Yelled at my wife and I for complaining about driving 8 hours down to Southern California without getting a call for the jump being cancelled. Mike tells me he only has one plane and The propeller fell off today ???!! Please take my word and book with a bigger company that has more reliable/safer planes and more importantly  a decent customer service<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Oh my Tandem pilot was amazing!!!! He was very freindly, supernice. He was very helpful to get me on this as this was my first jump, he made it so comfy.
Great place to jump as the view was worth million.
They take jumps very seriously for the safety of people. Our jump was delayed for almost and hour due to dark clouds... but once they passed oh we geared up for one the most adventurous thing.
My ODV Anmark was brilliant as well, she took great shots and videos of me with a great view.
Later one the video I saw doing crazy stuffs on cam which made my video so cool.
Will be a great memory.
My jump was excellent...... I m definitely coming back again... and recommend others as well.
Go jumpfly the sky n taste how it tastes and you will always look up.!!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dc702e7962ca9d:0xceed590d529b63a8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Some friends and I made a reservation for a sunset jump (4pm), and drove out from las vegas to do it.  We left Vegas at 7 am, ready to go and with plenty of time to arrive, book our hotel, and head to skydive.  We got a text at 1 pm that day saying that our dive was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.  We called, and were told that weather had pushed the timetable back, and if we wanted to come down they would try to fit us in, but no guarantees.

We decided to try our luck, and drove down...

We arrived at the office, and asked to speak to someone about whether we would be able to fly or not, they directed us to the manager who told us that at 8 am it had gotten very cloudy, and no one was able to jump for 3 hours.  As such the timetable had been pushed back, and sadly there was no time for us to jump today.  I explained we had driven all the way out from Las Vegas to jump with them, and he told us he understood that but there was nothing he could do, he offered to reschedule us for another day, but as they were full both Saturday and Sunday he was unwilling to schedule us for then.

The reasons for the low review score are these.

1.  The company did not call/text us when inclement weather occured to let us know we might be delayed.  Nor did they let us know after it was clear we WOULD be canceled (at 11 am)  They waited until 1pm to let us know.  I completely understand if things get canceled because of weather and am in no way holding them responsible for the weather.

2.  The company was unwilling to work with us in any way shape or form after bumping us from our times.  A reservation is a reservation, if someone has one for a specific time it holds no less value than someone from an earlier time.  If they are going to bump people who are later in favor of those who are earlier then it makes no sense whatsoever to EVER book later with these people.

3.  The company was perfectly willing to cancel later reservations, yet was unwilling to push anyone from other days in order to make things right with those who were canceled in prior days.

4.  While the manager displayed a calm demeanor, the receptionists don't.  They are rude, and unpleasant.

5.  If you say "I would like to make this right for you"  then do nothing whatsoever to "make this right for you"  then it is a lie.  Don't lie to potential customers.

We booked with Lake Elsinore skydiving the next day and had an awesome time.  its a little bit more spendy, but the customer service was good, and it actually felt like they cared.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Made a reservatuon and still had to wait 2 HOURS TO GO.... This is unfair and the management is terrible for allowing this. Very unfair to those who have planned out there entire day to be told that they still have to wait a LONG time even though they had a reservation. Reading all these reviews alot of people have this same problem... time for management to make some adjustments. UNBELIEVABLE.<//review>

GoJumpOceanside. The only complaint I have was that we had an appointment on Sunday at 12pm and we didn't jump till right before 5pm. When we arrived and checked in they said they hadn't jumped anyone all morning due to weather(sky's weren't clear enough over head) and said we had a 2hr wait , they started to send planes up but they had all the morning appointment to get through and catch up on, so we left and went to go eat, came back at 2pm and still had more of wait and they were stoping again because clouds were coming back.But to be honest after being there you could say that they should call you and let you know what's happening if delayed and your appointment is in the PM but in reality they only had 2office staff their that day and that's a lot of people to call and no one can detect the what the weather is going to do. And to be honest I'd rather wait all day or reschedule if their major concern is the safety of everyone going into the sky , so for me I'd rather be delayed hours if it means it's the best safety precautions they can do by delaying and making sure the weather is in good condition to sky dive . But anyways it Was a great experience! , the skydive was nothing like I thought it would be! IT WAS AWESOME! -and my sky dive Professional Thomas made it awesome! The only complaint is the delayed hours but after going through it , it was completely understandable weather safety is serious and I'd rather have that then a business that doesn't care about that, and Go Jump Oceanside is by the beach so you have to realize that , that kind of weather is a common thing their so delays are highly possible. And since we were delayed about 4.5 hrs when we jumped it was sunset time so that was even better . So my advice is if your going their plan an appointment around from morning time to 1pm and for sure you probably will jump that day even with delays ,. And plan it to be an all day thing or half day event , don't just plan on coming in at your time and being out in an hour but other than that it was a AWESOME EXPERIENCE and I would do it again<//review>

Be careful if purchasing jumps on Groupon. I bought a groupon for one jump at GoJump Oceanside so that I could join my friends on the date they had already reserved. However when I tried to redeem the groupon GoJump told me my groupon was not valid for the day my friends were jumping, that it was only worth $50 towards a jump on that date (I paid $179 on Groupon), and that I'd have to wait a month to redeem my groupon without paying extra. Groupon was a complete pain to get a refund from as well.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service, I had the opportunity to contact Mathew who guided me throughout the process, the purchase was highly recommended, now I just need to grab the courage for my wife and sister-in-law to jump, see you soon! God first.

(Translated by Google) Very bad communication. I had several doubts regarding a jump to give away, and only once did they answer the call and an email, then I could not communicate again, since they do not answer the phones or they did not respond to the EMAIL.
The web page is not clear, the only time they answered me the information was different (cost and about the video of the jump) with what appears on the web ..
Therefore I could not or rather, decided not to buy due to mistrust.

Muy mala comunicacion. Tenia varias dudas respecto a un salto para regalar, y solo una vez me constestaron la llamada y un email, luego no pude volver a comunicarme, ya que no atienden los telefonos ni me respondieron el EMAIL.
La pagima web no es clara, la unica vez que me atendieron la informacion era diferente (costo y sobre el video del salto) con lo que figura en la web..
Por ende no pude o mejor dicho, decidi no comprar por desconfianza.

Very bad communication. I had several doubts regarding a jump to give away, and only once did they answer the call and an email, then I could not communicate again, since they do not answer the phones or they did not respond to the EMAIL.
The web page is not clear, the only time they answered me the information was different (cost and about the video of the jump) with what appears on the web ..
Therefore I could not or rather, decided not to buy due to mistrust.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) It's cold going up. Wear it warmly ... and it's a bit dizzy when you're spinning. Tell the Instructor not to spin, not a photo, but I did an outside video and this is better. It's a waste of money for wrist videos and other photos.

(Original)
올라 가면 추워요. 따뜻하게 입으시길...그리고 빙빙 도는데 좀 어지럽습니다. 인스트렉터 한테 스핀 하지 마라고 하세요.사진 말고 전 아웃 사이드 비디오 햇는데 이게 젤 나아요. 손목 비디오나 다른 사진은 돈 아까워유..비싸도 아웃 사이드 비디오 추천</Review>

(Translated by Google) I made a reservation with the most expensive package and paid for the total price. I asked for an extra deposit for the amount of the deposit.
