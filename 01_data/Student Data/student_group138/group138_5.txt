<Pics>None<//Pics><review>I hardly ever post reviews, especially not negative ones. Placed an online order at 9:24, place closes at 10:30. I arrive to the place and it’s closed, with a “be back in 30” sign. Already knew it wasn’t going to be a good experience. I see the 2 workers cleaning in a rush, like they just want to get out of there (which I understand), but there’s more than an hour left for the place to close! I check my order to see if it’s complete and looks good from the outside, but when I get home I’m in for the nastiest looking chicken I have ever seen, there was raw parts in it, there was absolutely no grilling, maybe some boiling and I don’t wanna go too in depth, I’ll just let the couple of photos I took speak fro them selves.
I go back to show it to them, they agree it’s not well cooked and offered to redo it. I don’t want them to dirty the stuff they just cleaned, though I wonder what would happen with the next few orders. I asked for a refund.
They couldn’t process
a refund because it was an online order. They called the manager, and I talked to her, she would process the refund  until tomorrow morning.
It’s not so much about the money, it’s the time wasted, the exposure to raw chicken, and just an overall bad experience.

Would give it Zero stars if possible.</review>< rating>

One of my preferred places for quality Asian food. I give this spot a thumbs up. I think I might become a regular. This place has a nice design. Menu is similar to a restaurant in El Paso I loved.</review>

Visiting WaBa is not frequent for me. However, when I do in my opinion the food is very good.
Today working the front was Alexus. In opinion her people skills are on point. Not only that she's very helpful too. Great job< /Text>

I have been to other locations and usually love their food. However,  I recently went to this location and I think the menu was recently updated. I ordered their chicken salad and I was disappointed to find out that it is now made lettuce instead of kale like it used to be. The portion was smaller and the chicken was cut very thin< /text>

They mix up the orders way to often. Today they served me HALF the bowl. I paid full price why is it only half full ....?  I didn’t realize it until I got home. NEVER coming here again. You lost a frequent costumer 👌🏻<//review>

<review>Personally, I'm not sure why I occasionally dine-in or purchase take out meals from this specific location. It's probably the close proximity to my home and the travel time is under ten minutes. However, the service is absurd and the wait is usually twenty minutes or so. Some fellow reviewers might feel that this critique is too harsh or feel I'm being dismissive. I'm not sorry, I really don't care and I'm sure WaBa Grill will continue to gain revenue. That's the customer's choice, time, and money if they wish to eat here or not. Nonetheless, I've been here dozens of times and results are generally the same. I'll change my view and perhaps give a higher rating if the production is up on the ante. Until then, they'll need improve.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) I like it but they give me only two envelopes of siracha and the waba sauce only one is sad because it is not enough for my plate.

<review>(Translated by Google) I usually like Waba Grill but at this place they served us medium raw rice. All of us who asked for the pick up order had a hard time when we were already eating after two hours I went to notify and they returned all the money. They were responsible when returning. My humble opinion be more strict on the quality of your food before selling it.

Normalmente me gusta Waba Grill pero en este lugar nos sirvieron el arroz medio crudo. Pasamos un mal rato todos los que pedimos la orden por pick up cuando ya estábamos comiendo luego de dos horas fui a notificar y me devolvieron todo el dinero. Fueron responsables al devolver.

<Text>This place just opened up on my exit to my home. My daughter was happy to see it open and I opened a family meal.  $35 for 3 large entrees,  2 sides.  I also ordered walnut shrimp for and extra $10. Everything was fresh and they cooked the teriyaki chicken, chowmein  and Beijing Beef fresh for my big order.  It was clean and bright.</Text><Time>1619833119159</Time><gmap_id>0x809015e29065a34d:0x9d6cd58e92d5aad2< /gmap_id><user_name>Clarissa Ignacio<//user_name></record>

The taste was ok, but for 2 people getting the 2 item meal w/ 2 medium cokes, came to almost $26. Wow, expensive too< /Review>< pictures>

Last visit was probably my worst experience at a Panda Express. The food was flavorless, plus the portion sizes were abismal.< /review>

Portion size has been cut in half. Food is cold. Employees are very nice. I thinking  management and upper management are the problem. This place used to serve good portion sizes.  Get it together management.<//Review>

Unlike the one in Manteca California this panda express is a little bit smaller it’s located off of I-5 and is smaller but has a couple of HD TV so you can enjoy sports while eating your meal.</text>

It isn't horrible but it doesn't stand out it's even slow. I've come back but the service still hasn't gotten better not a big thing however I think it's definitely something they need to improve before they start loosing business.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX7c-b_TFkd8nvX2VFqRWpuyxKabm44URuq4QG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqkM5LMq0zEEsDMLDI7PotPtzVDiP33_hnVcki=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwLrqJTFJ7ni4rP9nnfbkobpgiIaUUIoepKRUT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTk465EVeBLCZC7K6AqYdm_YaMjK15ld5ANaye=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaxumtXZZXiT_M0GjIB2dH9FjGBdihpbOzhXsl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

I have always loved this place but they really stepped up during the pandemic. I'm so happy they're weathering it and we can still go out for a lovely dinner and yummy drinks. They even provide water for my doggie who loves to stop in for a drink after his walk. ;)</text>

<Review>Great food and beer and super nice bartenders - highly recommend! Haven't had anything bad here. Have had the potato pancakes, trout, meatloaf, wiener schnitzel, and sausages all great. Usually get a hefeweizen too.<//Review>< Rating>

< Review>
Reasonable price with much better than average bar food. And tons of selections. Tons of tvs everywhere and a big projector. Nice staff. There’s lots of parking in the back.
And there’s a secret bar/speakeasy. Find it!!

I think they have a recently new management so the food is much better than before if you haven’t been here in a while.</Review>

Food was good👍 Had the Black Label Burger with string fries. However, beer selection was large but largely unimpressive. Was hoping for more local brewed options but most were beers I can go buy at the store for much less. Came for the beer but was satisfied with the food. Don't think I would have a reason to come back here.< /text>

<text>If you want to watch sports, this is the place!  Huge screens and lots of seating. Everyone orders at the bar so there is no table service. You are on your own to get the next round.

<Text>So, these are the best fish n chips in the city (true story) !! It's also the best sports bar in the city !! It's also the best nachos and Jell-O shots and occasionally you get a jaeger rep in a deer costume taking polaroids of you...which is the best in the city. Now, I don't watch sports or have ever had fish n chips outside of this bar but I guarantee you...best in the city!!!< /Text>< pics>

Food was fine, of what we got. The website was updated to match the new items they were going to offer in April, but we arrived in March, which meant none of the mains we wanted we're available yet. Major disappointment, so I didn't eat. My companions found suitable substitutes, but I didn't, so I enjoyed the pretzel and that was it. We sat on their enclosed patio where they had decided to keep the heaters turned off, even though it was in the sixties. The menus were honestly filthy, I assume because they didn't want to print new ones before the menu change over, but let me tell you what isn't appetizing at all, a filthy restaurant, which is all I can extrapolate when the menus are covered in a heavy film of gross from all the hands that had fingered them before. I'll try this place again, now that the menu's changed, and hope they have five star fish and chips, which I couldn't order on this first, dissappointing trip.  It gets three stars because the waitress was nice, the food we got was fine, and I really liked the decor, and the focus on classic Los Angeles. It's hard to ignore the other problems, let's hope they solve them.</Text>

This place has changed...smaller menu... chef does not fulfill requests (I asked for medium well burger and I got a rare burger) ... service is still great... unfortunately I will not return... review below was before ownership changed.

This one of my go to places. Great HR from 11a to 4p...buy one get second for a penny.

Food is excellent.  Service could be great or not depending on the server (only one really). Although the menu is somewhat limited it is ALL GOOD!

I like the sausage plate, the salads, the pasta, lobster ceviche.... good food.</text>

We tried the bar/cafe on a Friday night because there were open tables. The entire experience much to be desired. Food was overpriced for the quality. Fries were inedible due to intense amount of salt. Layout, atmosphere and service was awkward. No reason to return really.<//review>

Spacious!! Pool tables!!! TV's!!!!! Awesome place. Places to sit everywhere! Love how the upstairs has them pool tables. Beers on beers on beers! So yea that don't serve hard liquor but it's a good pre game joint or a place to just chill with your friends.</Text>

< Review>
5 line is a nice place to sit at the bar or snag a table with some friends inside or patio if you like and order a craft beer (too many to choose from on tap)  or order some chow from the menu, plus bottled beer and full liquor bar. The bloodies are pretty strong if you like that on a Saturday or Sunday. To watch a game or not watch the game? Who cares and have some delicious pizza from big mama's next door delivered to your table I would order that over anything on the menu!</Review>

<Review>New owners changed the place soooo much that it is no longer any fun just to stop for a cold one!  Why would you have Happy Hour during the middle of the day??? Make sure you read you check carefully, you may find extra charges for items ordered! Best thing on the menu, Fries!< /Review>< pics>

My wife and I have been coming to 5 Line for years now and absolutely love it. Sure it's a bit on the pricey side, but they go out of their way to make you feel at home. The food is great, the beer selection is awesome, the staff is courteous and friendly. What more could you ask for in a local sports bar?< /Text>

went to watch the rams@saints game there, atmosphere was great! it is like a mexican community, the restaurant has some GRAFFITI arround its walls, inside is pretty great, surrounding several tvs. food there is surprisingly great, i dont like mexican food too much. try the lobster ceviche, really fresh!
but by the way, it's actually more like a mexican sports bar, not as it said italian. you can see through the menu there.<//Review>

5 line handled our party of 11 with aplomb.  Our waitress was gracious and polite.  The food was rather tasty, and the tap list was huge.</review>

Great selection of beers and an awesome buy one get one for 1 cent happy hour (if you can get there before 4pm). Friendly staff, but the bar food is a little on the expensive side.<//Text>

Drinks: LOVE their beer menu, 50 Beers On Tap! Orange Blossom and Angry Orchard (cider). They are both light and fruity, just the way I like it!

Food: My favorite is Gourmet Sausage plate!! 3 types of sausage, Andouville, Chicken apple and Italian Sausage. It also comes with Bavarian kosher salt pretzel, sauerkraut, dijon mustard and whole grain mustard. They go soooo well with cold beer!

The Parking: On Colorado, street metered parking. Side street, residential area, free parking.<//Review>

<Text>Bartenders are friendly and attentive. Plenty of TV with sports but it doesn't feel like a sports bar. Lots of draught options to choose from. Make sure you order the chips instead of fries, trust me.< /Text>< userid>

< Review>
I have seen this place in the area for some time and i also see them listed on Postmates. They have these pulled pork nachos that look amazing on the site and menu so i had to try them. What a waste of time and money. They tossed some chips in a to-go container, topped it with a little pico and cheese, then tossed HUGE chunks of tasteless pork on top. Where was the guac and sour cream that was pictured and listed on the menu?! That ish was nasty and just thrown together without a care. I've been here before with a friend and thought the food was overrated and over priced. I stand by that today and will never patronizing this business again. 😝< /Review>

Came to this place because a friend wanted to get a beer. I was truly impressed with all their beer options. I believe they have 50 beers on tap. I am a fan of Leffe Brun and no one ever has it, but they did! The customer service there is awesome as well. I might have a new Sunday football hang out.</Text>

<review>I had Storage Etc... on Hancock Street recommended to me by a good friend who stores with them as well. I needed to store my furniture and items from my house during a remodel and was skeptical to use self storage at all.
When I first visited the storage I was pleased by the appearance and help from the office staff. The young lady that moved me in also ensured that I had a space that was easy to get to as well as went over the lock and code with me well enough that I was able to comfortably come back on my own time. I have had my things in storage for a little over three months now and every time I need to bring more things in or pick something up I have a pleasant experience.
I would like to further recommend this storage to anyone who feels apprehensive over storage facilities; this one really stands out as a relief!<//review>< pics>

This location is clean, well-organized, and well-staffed. I've never had any problems with access, including use of a cart when I've needed one. When I've had any questions, the staff have been helpful and friendly. Also never had any issues with the space or any of the spaces near mine.</review>

<text>I’ve had several storage units in the past but was always disappointed with how there would be rift raft hanging around on their bicycles or tweaker’s working on their cars in the parking lots or adjacent properties. Then I found this place in Old Town.

Storage Etc is clean! The lights are very bright in the halls which enables me to see in my unit. I feel like my stuff is not going to be stolen and that if my Mom were to go to the unit for me, she’s not gonna have to deal with people sneaking around the storage complex looking to steal the first thing they see unattended for two seconds. All in all my only regret is it took me this long to find this place.

Thanks to Desiree and her staff for providing a service the is above the rest at a price I can afford.

All the best,

<text>I have had a storage locker at the Hancock St location for 4 1/2 years and have been very happy with my experience. The facility is always immaculate, never have any issues accessing my unit, night or day.
I feel very safe there with number of cameras around as well. It's location is great as well, very convenient just off the 5 and Pacific Hwy. I would highly recommend this facility uf you are looking for storage.<//text>< Name>

I was on a time crunch and trying to multitask way more then humanly possible. I was in a situation where I had to rent a storage and move things in 20 mins later. Desiree made the process as seamless as possible. She was very patient, she gave me all my options, pointed out the best for what I was looking for and then handled all the paperwork over the phone.
Great customer service ! Thx Desiree< /text>

The facility is clean. It is a storage unit. Not much else to say, except,  they raise the rent price every single year and the insurance is not part of your monthly rent. We have just been informed that we will now be paying over $200 a month for an upstairs 10x10. We have found so many other that cost less. Time to move.< /Text>

After moving from a large house to an apartment, I chose Storage Etc. to store my excess furniture and belongings for its convenient location and clean facilities.  I began my connection to Storage Etc. four years ago, making several changes along the way.  Throughout the process, Tammy and Rhianna have been wonderfully helpful and accommodating.  Each time I go there, they are always warm and friendly as well, making each visit very pleasant.</Review>

I have been using Hancock Storage since I moved to San Diego in 2005. This is the cleanest and most well run storage facility in the 92104 area.
There is plenty of parking, plenty of carts and the whole property is clean and secure feeling. The location is 2 minutes off of the 5.
Tammy is so great to deal with! She is very friendly and easy to deal with- in and out with a unit in less than 15 minutes!
I know it is a strange thing to rate, but they always have spotless and sanitized restrooms! When you are stuck at the storage unit for a couple of hours, nature calls. Will always use them when I need storage.<//Review>

THE BEST storage experience I have ever had, and I've had about a dozen of them. Rhianna (sp?) is so professional and efficient, yet accommodating and friendly. The world could use more of people like her. The units, and general facilities are clean and modern, and secure. I would definitely return and recommend to anyone else. Many thanks to the Storage Etc - Hancock St staff.< /text>

I drove by the location and it looked good. Saw the reviews so I rented a unit online. The office called me and made the process super easy when I came to get my keys. Good price and ask for the $1 Special!<//review>

Hello! I would love to recommend Storage Etc. on Hancock Street if you are in need of a REALLY NICE place to store items. The office and the building is very clean and feels very safe day and night. They are even staying open right now to make sure we can get to our items.< /review>

Tammy and Rhianna were very helpful moving me in. I got a great deal on a nice storage space and plan on using it to keep my extra work equiptment. I liked that they have access to the storage until 9 PM because I work past 7 most days. Very clean and nice.< /text>

After 9 years I am finally ready to enjoy my belongings again! I have used this storage place for so long and have been very happy. The managers have changed a handful of times over the years, but never have I had any issues with any of them. The facility is always clean, the staff is always helpful and friendly. I went through a few periods throughout the years where I was having difficulty keeping up on my payments but the management always worked with me.
Now that I am leaving my storage I feel a sense of relief, but I honestly will miss coming here! Thank you Storage Etc. for being such a blessing to me for almost the last decade. If any of my friends are in need of a storage unit I will highly recommend! *****</Text>

< review>
WOW!! I never thought I would be so impressed with a storage facility. I spend my week researching where to rent a storage space and narrowed it down to just 3 in the area. The first two were WAY dirtier to say the least (and prices were not much different). The second one had a HORRIBLY rude sales person and when I arrived at Storage Etcetera I had a bad taste in my mouth. Didn't think it would be any better than my prior experiences from the day.... Tammy greeted me in the office with a smile and proceeded to show me around and go over all of my objections. I was very pleased with the overall layout and cleanliness of the place. I didn't get as big of a discount renting here but I feel MUCH happier bringing my business to a courteous and well run place. I read their other reviews and they are SPOT on. I would recommend this place if you have a bad experience elsewhere or just want a pleasant experience off the bat!<//review>

Tammy at the front desk was was very, very helpful and accommodating.
We had underestimated the size we would need to accommodate our belongings in the unit we had reserved.

Tammy thoughtfully found us an additional smaller unit close by that fit our needs beautifully. She was kind and very helpful through out our experience.

She was amazing, thank you, Tammy!!!!< /Review>

Hello! I want to express my thanks to this company. I am going through quite a transition with my living situation right now and the ladies in the office helped me out so much. I needed to find storage for my items quickly and Tammy helped me get the perfect size. I didn't get a discount but I honestly I don't even want one. I got a great price and I am very happy. Come and see this storage if you need one, you won't be disappointed!</Review>

<review>Hello! I have stored my art supplies and tools from our garage here for about a year now. I am finally writing a review- Every time I have come down to pick up or drop off some of my items I am pleased to come to a well kept and easily accessible storage. I don't like that I have to put my code in twice for entry, but this is how security works! Thank you for keeping my items safe and being so helpful when I needed your help getting my online profile set up. Great work, keep it up!

Very happy about the top notch security and  the very professional staff.
Rhianna and Tammy are just awesome! Super clean place, no homeless or or shady people that hang out. No one is ever here but I understand that they are almost full.  I would highly recommend this facility to anyone looking to store their belongings without any worries.<//text>< user>

I used to store near my home but the place I was at was so dirty and there were homeless people EVERYWHERE camping and hanging out. I have stored here for 3 months now and I feel much safer and it is much cleaner. I would highly recommend if you need storage- and they have climate control too which is nice.<//review>< pictures>

I walked into the Hancock St Office to check out the storage facility and was greeted originally by Rhianna who was so nice, knowledgeable and efficient.  She patiently answered all of my questions and took me on a tour of a few storage units. The site was perfect for me it was so clean, accessible, secure and  close to my home and my office.  I had also rented a space several years ago at their Morena Blvd location and it was a great experience. Rhianna made suggestions about storage for my items and also looked for any specials they may of had for the units I had looked at to help me with my decision.  She had the best customer service skills, was professional and still is.  I have since moved my items in and couldn't be happier with the customer service of all their staff including Tammy and maintenance staff.  Highly recommend this facility!< /Review>

<Text>Storage Etc. on Hancock Street in San Diego is the BEST!!! Rhianna helped me when I was moving to the area from Pheonix and made the process so easy! I had no idea what I was doing when I was moving to San Diego and her help really made the experience less stressful. I shopped online for a week before I called this place. They had the best reviews and seemed close enough to Downtown San Diego but not too close so that parking would be an issue. When I finally arrived and checked the place out, I was truly impressed. Clean as a whistle, nice and professional management and a good price from what I researched in this area.
Again, thank you for making my move to this beautiful city easy breezy!< /Text>< Pictures>

Very clean well kept storage facility. Even the elevator smells good. Nice access hours (6am-9pm) and unit is easy to navigate to. Never a problem with parking or finding a cart to use.<//text>

< Review>
This was definitely as good as it gets. Tammy, her assistant and even the maintenance man were friendly and accommodating. The day i moved in i was rushed and had to redo my storage paperwork because the ones i'd chosen online where not big enough and Tammy was beyond accommodating. I'd even lost my keys once and they helped me resolve it with ease and patience. Also, neither of my units were temperature controlled however, that was never an issue. My full two bedrooms worth of belongings were in storage for 1 1/2 years and everything was emasculate when i retrieved them. And lastly the pricing is very competitive. I cannot recommend this place enough and as long as i'm in this area Storage etc will be my storage location of choice.</Review>

I am a current client and have had no problems with this particular office and look forward to continue storing my personal belongings with them.  I have no complaints about the service at all.  If anything I am quite appreciative of the friendly service I have received. I consider myself very lucky. Thank you.
I have had a wonderful experience with no problems what so ever in regards to how the place looks, because it is always clean and well taken care of.
Thank you Gretchen<//review>

I had a great experience here. I really needed a storage unit and they provided one with no hassle and they are also military friendly providing me with a military discount that really helped me out. this stopped me from having to fly to Japan with all of those items and provided a safe ventilated place for me to safely store them. I would like to say also that Tammy was especially helpful and went out of her way to make sure that my needs were accommodated and I thank her personally right now.  I recommend this place to everyone.<//review>

Liked this place a lot more than some of the other storage places I have used. Clean, safe, cheap and easy system. Staff is nice, Tammy was helpful and easy to work with.  I went there at night and it was fine, no problems with the neighborhood. Inside has AC, which is nice and helpful on move day. Over all, its a great place to storage your stuff.<//Text>

I just moved out of an apartment with room mates and into my own place. Until the garage is cleared out, I need a place to keep a lot of my things. I went online a few weeks ago and found this place. It had pretty good ratings, and it was within my budget, so I made a reservation. A girl from the office called me back about 10 minutes later. She asked me a few questions and asked me to come visit the facility to make sure the space was the right size. I'm glad that I did, because I was convinced that I needed only 50 sq feet, and when I got there, she showed me the one that she recommended (75 sq feet) as well as the one I had reserved. She was right, I got the bigger one, and got my stuff in just fine the next day. It's super clean. They have big carts for moving and I have until 9pm everyday to put stuff/take stuff out of my storage.Great experience so far.</Review>

<review>This is the best storage unit I found in the area.  I've helped friends move into other storage units, and checked out several for my move, and this was the most impressive with reasonable prices to boot.  It's clean and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful, and they have climate control options as well.  The Manager Tammy is especially great with her advice.  I used this unit for an out of state move, which for me was very stressful, but I would say that Storage Etc helped to make it a less stressful experience.  Also it's located right off an exit on the 5, so that helps things move faster when you are dealing with runs to your unit.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Tammy and Rhianna have been so kind to me throughout my moving process. Six months ago I sold my house to move into a condo. I had to store quite a few things but wasn't really sure on the size that I needed. Tammy showed me 3 units and of course the one that she suggested was the correct size. My movers commented that this was one of the very cleanest storage facilities that they have been to so that made me feel good about my decision to use Storage Etc. Thank you ladies for your excellent service and making my life easier in this time of stress for me!
Sincerely,
Joanne Withers< /review>

Super nice staff and very nice inside. I just moved from a 2 bedroom apartment into a studio and am keeping my extra things here. Easy to navigate inside, very clean and feels safe. No homeless people hanging out in the halls all day like at my old storage I had a few years ago!<//Review>

I feel like my possessions are in good, no, GREAT hands at Storage Etc. on Hancock Street. Not only is it very clean, it feels safe and secure. I'm very comfortable with the security systems at the entrances/exits so that not just anybody can come or go, only those that are supposed to be there. Perhaps best of all is the staff, especially Tammy Geizr. She is both professional and personable at the same time, very easy to talk to. She explained everything very clearly and answered all my questions, and helped me find the best deal to suit my needs. I can rest easy knowing my possessions are safe and secure with her there. For that I give her many thanks!<//Review>

We went to this location to look at the sizes they offer to figure out what size would be best for us. Tammy ,Rhianna,  and Robert  have the best customer service we have received in awhile. They were all so welcoming and helpful. It was very easy to decide to choose this location. The access hours are great for before work tasks and after work events all year long. The place was clean and well maintained to add to the already five star facility. Teddy is the name of the person in charge of the maintenance on the property and I am told . It very nice to know a company takes pride in having someone on the grounds at all times to see that safety and cleanliness is a priority for the tenants.<//review>

Tammy helped me to rent a storage unit at this Facility on 2150 Hancock Street & Tammy was absolutely Fabulous.
Tammy actually came up with a couple of ideas that I hadn't even thought of. That was greatly appreciated & I wanted to take the time to write a quick review regarding the great service.
If you are looking for a Safe, Friendly Staff & Clean Facility, look no more.
In my experience, you would be totally satisfied storing your items here.

Ladies you are absolutely amazing! Very professional. Everytime I come to the office they are always there smiling and friendly! My move was so easy after a stressful day.

< review>
Since 2015 , I have been the family member to organize, store and distribute my late father's items.
For the last 2 years I have been able to curate those items , give many away and pass others on while using the storage unit as my hub.  The task was difficult but the environment at Storage Etc on Hancock Street made it as manageable and efficient.   .
Questions and accomodations regarding availability, pricing and terms were all met with knowledge and understanding by the staff.
Thanks so much.</review>

I think this is a great storage facility.  Very clean, well run and very pleasant staff.  Always willing to answer questions a provide a helping hand, if needed.  I dealt with Tammy who made sure I got the unit I needed in a convenient location.  Recommended!</text>

I had a TERRIBLE experience at Ballpark Storage downtown. Storage Etc is like a dream come true. The employees are always kind. The place itself is very clean, and I've never had issues with parking or stolen stuff. The price is quite reasonable, especially with the spectacular service. I live downtown and initially chose Ballpark, but the employee was ridiculously rude after bringing up an issue with a drugged out person sitting in front of my unit. Additionally, it always smelled terrible, there were puddles of urine everywhere, and people consistently living in their unit. The 7 min drive vs walking to Ballpark is TOTALLY worth it. I have had 0 issues since moving in 6 months ago.</text>

I have been a customer of Storage etc since 2008. Tammy, the desk manager has always been helpful, professional and deserves recognition. The facility is clean and appears to be very secure. Doing business with them has been pleasure and I highly recommend Storage etc.< /text>

There was nothing but professionalism and concern from the moment I walked into the door -  I had an unfortunate situation happen that was out of my control, and not only did Tammy G help me get into a unit fast and secure transportation within a reasonable amount of time, she ALSO asked me what happened!  That is amazing customer service, indeed!  I was just going to go in and pay whatever I needed to but she made me feel much better about the transaction and I would recommend Storage Etc to anyone either in desperate need OR just need a space to store some items!   Storage unit is clean, clutter free, secure!< /Review>

Before Storage Etc., Hancock, we had no experience with storage facilities. This place is clean, secure, and temperature controlled, what more can you ask for? It may not be the cheapest, but considering the value of your property, cheaper is never better. Liz and the staff are friendly and professional - exceptional customer service! We live closer to other storage places, but would never consider moving. Their proximity to the freeway is very convenient. 2 thumbs up!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This was my first experience with a storage company, and one that I am glad to say was positive.  From the very beginning they showed exemplary customer service - I wanted a $1 first month rent unit and unfortunately the unit I had wanted wasn't available anymore, which ended up being OK - Tammy was helpful walked me through the facility and showed me the unit I would be renting and said she would honor the $1 first months rent with that unit.  A lot of the staff who had witnessed movers treat my possessions like garbage informed of what happened and they also didn't charge me for a violation (the movers had left some items they said they would dump) and gave me time to stop by to properly dispose of the items.

Yes they may be a bit more expensive, but you really do get what you pay for in storage.  The cheaper storage places was cheap for a reason (dirty, somewhere where I didn't want to drive to, and "secure") - this facility was extremely clean (almost shockingly so) and I have no qualms with walking around barefoot.  Not a single insect or rat, it didn't smell in any way (those are some of the cleanest bathroom I've seen for this type of facility), and it was obviously secure with how you had to enter the unit.  Yes the bathroom situation does kind of suck (you can only use it during office hours), but I was told if it was left open, then the potential for homeless people waiting to be able to get into the unit and spending nights in the facility was very possible. I've never struggled with parking and I've never had to wait to use a cart.  This place also has some of the longest access hours (6am - 9pm) I've seen compared with other storage facilities whose access hours are usually the same as the office hours (or they give like an hour leeway before and after).  My friend's storage facility was only open from 7am - 5 pm and most people are getting ready for work or at work during those hours.

Simply put - incredibly clean with long hours with a great staff who actually acknowledge the fact they are providing a service to paying customers and in turn give great customer service.  I don't know who that man is who seems to have turned people off, but I've never seen him and if he is in the office then I would wait until Tammy is back (blonde).  I should also mention that although I'm not 100% sure and I've never asked, I'm almost certain that Tammy is in the office from 9am - 6pm every single day of the week. I've gone to the storage unit at all possible hours and all days throughout the week multiple times and without fail if the office was open, she was there and never once has she been grumpy or in a bad mood. I will be back for sure!<//review>< Pics>

I had a good first experience with Storage Etc, so returned for a second time. I planned to keep my items in storage for a month and two days. When I called at the end of the first month to ask how they would calculate the charges for the two additional days, they said I had to pay for a full additional month, as stipulated in the fine print of the contract. If I did not, they explained, they would revoke my building access code so I could not access my belongings. I feel that they should have explained to me the check-out policy, rather then just burying it in the contract, and further, that customers should never be required to pay for a full month when they only are in the facility for 2 or 3 days of that month. The 10 day advance notice on move out was also never explained to me.</text>

<Review>Friendly accommodating staff. I used three units here. First a large 15x12 for all my belongings, then a medium unit 8x6', and finally a small unit. All three had very high ceilings, full lightning. It's a secure compound with specific door codes for individuals, not a standard entry code. So after someone uses the site, his code will no longer open the door when he moves out.  Cameras watch the hallways. Restroom on site.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I had a great experience here. I recently relocated from Old Town, San Diego to the Bay Area. I had way too much stuff and this place was just across the overpass from my former apartment. I looked up their rates and storage sizes on their website (seemed reasonable to me). I made a reservation with Tammy over email. The day of my move, I met with Rhianna who was very helpful and informative. She went over the contract, the fees, the space, and helped me pick out a lock (bring one if you don't want to buy one there).

Since then, I've been to SD a few times to unload pro audio equipment for events and also look for things I might need to bring back to the Bay. My unit was always very accessible and in a well-protected, climate controlled environment. I felt the security was top notch as well.

I moved out a couple of days ago when I realized that I had moved all my stuff out. I got rid of my shelves that day after posting them for free on craigslist. I walked into the office after my unit was emptied and asked about moving out. I think I should have given a notice, but they still accommodated me and I was out of there in less than 5 minutes.

Oh, also, make sure you read the fine print on the contracts and such. You need to get renter's insurance if you don't have it. Also, I think there's some specials advertised but that's for certain storage sizes. I took advantage of the special with a free moving truck for the day, which was helpful, but you should reserve in advance to make sure the truck is available.

Anyway, 5 stars, no doubt. The staff does a great job and the space is safe and accessible.< /review>< Pics>

I would personally like to Thank TAMMY for her "Amazing" customer service & being so accomodating!!  A+ in my book. - Also, I would like to add what a wonderful facility this is.  The cleanliness is almost unheard of after the previous units I have rented in the recent past.  Due to the above mentioned (Tammy, cleanliness, safety, and PERFECT hours of entry/exit availability), I am almost excited to move in to this facility, although storage and moving are never fun!

Thank you all (especially Tammy) for the Great experience at Storage Etc. Hancock Street.

A part of this is ensuring that we have minimal loitering both inside the storage facility and on the property. However, our managers also obviously understand it takes time to move items in and out of your storage unit. It is standard for our managers to go over this part of our rules when we have a new customer move in. I do apologize if you took offense to this, but as I mentioned before, we strive to have a safe, clean, and secure storage environment for all of our customers.\n\nThank you,\n\nAmanda'}< /resp>

Don't even bother , the guy working starts accusing you of sleeping there before you even rent a place .
Grinding you down about what you are gunna store , than starts telling you how you can't spend time in your storage .....so how am I gunna put my stuff in ? So if you wanna be interrogated about your life and what your doing without being arrested this is the place .</review>

<review>This store recently underwent some incredible changes. The old management was way over-priced and because of that many products didn't sell and the building was overcrowded. I had seen a couple pairs of shoes that stayed in the store for years! Because of that I used to go only on special sale days because that was the only time things were reasonably priced. Now things are different and so much nicer! The staff is very friendly, the store was reorganized and they have taken some of the product off of the main floor making it much easier to shop in! The store also has a new pricing system!  It went from being run like an antique boutique to being run like an actual thrift store! Between the reorganization and the new lower prices, I can definitely see my family and I shopping here more often!< /review>< pics>

Maybe you haven't been there recently but new management and the store is tastefully displayed.   Prices are incredibly affordable and    grouped by tops, coats, dresses.  I could have bought twice the items.  Great inventory and people.  Worth a stop back.< /text>

The store for as long as I can remember was reasonable with prices but now!! For your local home grown Lincoln residents like myself  you are ripping people off. Prices are way over priced and what’s sad is stuff I’ve donated I’ve seen and in my own person yard sales never would charge for what you charge. It’s supposed to be affordable and discounted. Very sad cause I have donated a lot of clothes. I guess after seeing this won’t be donating my stuff to your store anymore.<//review>

I haven't been here for a while, but I've lived in Lincoln 53 years, so I've been many many times. They have some real good products and a lot to choose from, no matter what you're looking to buy. Give it a try. You'll be surprised what you will find.<//Review>

Have you not read the Word of God???  Some friends, my husband and I went out for the day and stopped by the salt mine after having lunch,  my husband after looking around a bit needed to us the restroom before continuing shopping.  He walked into the store part where you pay, to ask where the restrooms were, they treated him like he was scum!!!   They told him NO,  I am truly appalled!!!  I am so grieved in my spirit!!!  MY husband is a God fearing man, he loves the Lord, plays the guitar for the Lord!!!  Didn't God send His only Begotten Son that we should love one another and not judge!!!
CHRIST came for a lot more then that but, you decided to judge my husband!  My husband has dementia and Parkinson.  I will be Praying that the Lord Jesus Christ do what He sees fit!!!  Just know this that you all should be ashamed of yourselves and get on your knees and ask the Lord for forgiveness!!!</Review>

Great donations. But for a thrift shop solely based on donations is pricey!! It's too cramped inside. If the prices were lower on some of the larger items you could move around inside the store alot easier! As well as find your desired items easier too! Customer service is very welcoming.</text>

<user>101780691074317718110</user><Review>Salt Mine has a very large selection of thrift items, but their prices are WAY TOO HIGH, and I mean WAAAAAY too high. They offer 30%-50% off quite often, but that still results in grossly overpriced merchandise.

I think they forgot that they're a thrift store and got their inventory for free.   Staff is friendly and the store well arranged. They have almost no clothing and focus mainly on trinkets and furniture. Again, all of it is overpriced.</Review><time>1557100123169</time><rate>2<//rate><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809b3d1602d097dd:0x1ebc854d8bf8bfa6< /gmap_id>< Name>

<text>Jam packed. Huge and I mean HUGE inventory. Fantastic combo of thrift plus antiques. It's a benefit charity for the food bank so priced accordingly. They have random sales for what I purchased was 30% off. A fun hunt.</text>< pics>

I come here once a year, but I must be insane (doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results). Most of the people in the outer building are very nice, but the ladies inside the closed building seem to run the place and they have always been rude and their pricing is downright ridiculous! As a "thrift" store, they get their donations for free. Yet, they are higher priced on the majority of their items, than you could likely get them for retail in stores. $10-20 for run of the mill jeans, shoes anywhere from $20-150, coffee mugs $3-5, jackets will run you $20-100+. You have to be kidding me! I asked one of the ladies why they felt the prices should be so high and she straight up told me that's what they saw on eBay! Not what the items were "SOLD" for, but what people were TRYING to sell them for. I looked up a couple items and showed her what people were "actually" paying for a few items in comparison to what they had them priced for (much more) and she said she didn't care, as it was their shop and they will run it how they want. This is not eBay! You are supposed to be helping your community by offering the free donations you get, to others around your area at a fair price, when they can't afford, or don't want to pay full retail price, new.

This place is NOT a true thrift store. They are extremely greedy in their pricing and they are not here to help the community, only to take the communities donations in hopes of selling it for high profits. I always have and always will take my true business to the REAL thrift store and cat adoption shop in town, not even a mile away from this place. Please do yourself a favor and look them up instead and save the time and frustration of going through this shop. I hope this helps others and I can only hope that someday, this place will be run by someone who is fair and wants to HELP the community around them.<//review>

<Text>The prices are higher than a superb antique store for regular cast offs. Even trash is high priced. They need to read their reviews and change their prices. Don’t shop there if your looking for thrifty prices.< /Text>< time>

<review>I absolutely LOVE this place.  Everything is so well displayed and is of good quality.  I always seem to find something I can't live without.  The person who does the displays, does an excellent job of making it feel like a cute boutique.  Yes, some prices may seem a bit higher but with the 60% off, it comes out a deal you won't want to pass up,

I have been a local shopper here at the Salt Mine since its inception. I am very saddened today as I was so embarrassed by the public rudeness towards me by the elderly ladies in the "over priced side". I was forced to go over there because I pay with a card. I was met with such disdain that other customers were shocked and commenting about the rudeness. To top it off they got so confused ringing up the items that I was overcharged twice. Time for new younger kinder more professional employees on that side.<//review>

super nice people, like really really nice.  nice enough to get an extra star.

this is the Kohls of thrift stores.  they have really high prices than give 60% off. not worth it.  still overpriced.

not sure if they really interested in selling this stuff or showing off their collection of crap.  isles so packed I had to go outside to reach in my pocket, to get my wallet< /Review>

I visit thrift stores every day of the week all throughout California. This is the most expensive thrift store I've ever been to. The staff was rude they talk down on other thrift shops when I asked him if there were any locally. Items are cheaper online on Amazon brand new I will show you an example</Text>

<Review>The Salt Mine: while I like most of the people there, I'm struggling with their prices. It's not right to charge an arm and leg when they get something donated to them for free. I've even donated stuff there.  These prices are ridiculous and the owner doesn't even care. Sorry but that's rude, dude! Don't call yourself a thrift store when you are not!<//Review>< Pics>

EVERYTHING IS an arm and a leg, at a premium, big-ticket, costly,, excessive, exorbitant, high, highway robbery, holdup, immoderate, inordinate, out of sight, overpriced, pretty penny, pricey, sky-high, steep, stiff, too high, uneconomical, unreasonable..... BUT THE STAFF WAS EXCELLENT THEY HAD GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE VERY FRIENDLY.
AND DON'T GET ME WRONG I UNDERSTAND IT GOES TO CHARITY BUT THEIR PRICES ARE ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS.<//text>

Extremely over prices. Even with the 60% discount you still over pay. Nice selection of items but I would recommend passing this one and go anywhere else< /Text>

Even with the entire store half off, I could still get some of these items brand new for cheaper. No good deals in my opinion and I do a lot of thrifting</text>

Unbelievable prices. The worst I have ever seen! They have a 60 percent off sale and even with that prices are crazy. $8 for a plain baby onesie, $40 for a plain glass vase that should maybe be $5. Way over the top, don't even know how they can be in business.</Review>

We apologize for the inconvenience of the waiting during the opening hour.  There is a lot of kitchen preparation so we couldn't be ready on time.  Again, thank you for the good review and we will definitely work hard on the best quality drinks and customer service in consistency! We value your voice and appreciate your business!"}< /resp>
<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Their business hours on Yelp show that they open at 11 AM but when I arrived around 11:45 AM, one of the workers told me that they don't open until 12 PM. I'm not sure if they normally open at 12 PM everyday or if they just opened late today. Their door was open but blocked off and there were workers inside so I mistakenly thought it was open.

I ordered a roasted oolong milk tea with honey. It costs an additional $1 for adding honey. I also ordered an orange grapefruit yogurt which costs $7.24. I didn't pay attention to the prices when ordering so I was taken aback when I saw the breakdown of costs on the receipt. The drinks are good but over priced in my opinion.</review><time>1617841563849<//time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The cashier was friendly and the drinks were delicious! The pearls were chewy and not overcooked. The oolong milk tea had a strong tea flavor and was also creamy. Highly recommend :)) Glad this place opened in the Westfield Mall!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
I've seen Wushiland Boba locations pop up in different places in the SGV. I know they have another location in Focus Plaza but I've personally never been there but since I was at the mall decided to stop in and try it since they were brand new. They are located on the first floor right next to Macy's.

With social distancing guidelines, they made the queue line up outside and only one party at a time can be inside to place an order. And they tell you to wait outside until your drink is ready.  There's a good variety of different types of drinks here but I went with something basic.

Overall, the drink was pretty good I got the green milk tea with pearls. They do put more pearls in the drink compared to most places.  At least that's what it feels like.  My sister got the milk tea with ice cream and that sounded really good too.

Right now they do have a 10% off until the end of November if you comment on Google Maps or tag them on Instagram.</review>

<review>Un Be Liev Able!
WOW.

Ms.Donut is hidden gem here in Colton. The donuts were so delicious we didn't even get a picture before they were almost gone!

Their price is insanely good for the quality of donuts they make.

They've handled COVID precautions amazingly.

I WILL be coming back regularly.

I think that we met the owners when we went today. We were wearing our mealworm masks and they recognized the mealies and shared with us their experience with other cultures eating them (but don't worry, they don't put mealworms in their donuts). Such a cool story! Really friendly people. We hope to see you again soon!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Very bad service. Rush rush rush. Don't even think of thinking when he asks you. You better know what you want. Very awkward energy. Then your order will be wrong but you'll be so tired you'll take it and just never come back. They're punks and if I had the energy I'd tell this to their face already.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

What a nice treat.  When I stop next door to get flowers for my folks, I like to stop in to get a treat for myself.  Selection is amazing.  Nothing like a donut and Coffee...sit down or walk out, they go to gather either way.

When you stop in Tell them Joe sent you...they will say Joe Who...that's me...</Text>

Lived in NYC, Chicago and Los Angeles. Visiting family in the area and needed a good donut for kids and Adults. Some serious competition here.

Kids normally just eat the frosting/sprinkles at other places. They ate the donuts hole. Adults thought they were great too. Will stop by again, next time we are in the area.<//Text>

I sent my 8yr old son into the store. I could see him from the car, go in the store. I gave him a certain amount of money too buy a few donuts. He was suppose to get several dollars back in change. The lady that works there decided to take advantage of my son and not give him back his few dollars. It’s not about the few dollars it’s about l, someone taking advantage of a kid. My son came to the kid and said dad I think I was suppose to get money but she said no.

So I went into the donut shop and spoke to the same lady that service my son. She claimed it was a mistake, she gave me back the change. I would never go here ever again. Plus horrible customer service.</Text>

<text>They have a unique donette or donut hole I haven't seen anywhere else.  Some are rolled in Oreos, or custard filled, cinnamon, caramel drizzled, mini cremepuff... very tasty.  Good espresso lattes.< /text>< Pics>

Firt time taking my princess and last! I normally go with a different groomer. But since this place is closer to home. I thought I gave it a try. I was very disappointed. My princess came out looking the same as when I drop her off. Just smelling good! Not sure 🤔.< /review>

This place is my new most favorite place! The people are all far and above great.  Friendly, truly friendly. Not just friendly because they want my money. Truly nice. They are always really sweet to my stinky little guy Bentley. He hates going in the car. So he's shaking like a little leaf by the time he gets there. They are just so patient and unhurried.  And the way he looks and smells when I puck him up. Well. He's awesome! I cannot recommend them more highly.</Text>

Staff was very patient with our anxious dog. She growled a bit but the employee just took her time building rapport and I am very grateful. She came out looking great and with a nice scent of orange (you get to choose).< /text>

The Doggie Spa team is the absolute best! I’ve taken my dog here for years for routine grooming and am always impressed by their kind demeanor. They’ve gone above and beyond with their COVID protocols and do a great job at sticking to them. Highly recommend! Thank you Doggie Spa!<//Text>

<Text>This place is awsome with the dogs and there owners. They are completely following social distancing guidelines. They were able to solve a scratching problem with our border collie in 1 simple visit. Well worth the money for everything we have ever had done with our dogs. They should get dou le the stars I gave them.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

I really like Doggie Spa because of its atmosphere, the good customer service and how wonderful my dogs look after they are groomed (and I don't bring my dogs in every 1-2 months like I should). They do an Excellent Job and I can't believe the  prices! There are other grooming shops that I have tried in Riverside but I will drive to corona just because of their overall service and pricing.< /review>

First timer at this place and I love it.
My pitbull puppy so was happy and looked so comfortable when I picked him up, he was sitting on the lap of the front desk lady lol.
I recommend going here, you can tell they love  animals. You'll feel at ease leaving your baby with them.</Review>

<Text>Always do a great job with my pug. They are extremely honest. I've requested anal glands to be squeezed and nails to be grinded and when I go to pay I have not been charged because those items were not needed. I will continue to use them and would recommend their services.<//Text>< Pictures>

Going to find another groomer!
Usually they are great but it’s very hard to make an appointment. Even though I’ve had times where i made an appointment and had to cancel but I couldn’t even call to let them know. There should be someone that answers the phone to make appointment. I called today to get an appointment and the answering machine says we will call you back in 24 hours. That’s unacceptable, i called another day and they didn’t even call me back.
Also had one rude lady, when they didn’t cut my dog’s hair the way I wanted. She didn’t listen just “ya yayed” me.< /text>

I was so upset when I picked up my Japanese Chin and they had pretty much shaved her instead of listening to my instructions to just trim her. The explanation I got was, I thought that was a strange cut for a Japanese Chin. I don't think the groomer knew how to cut any other way. I told them I would never bring her back there again because it was the second time it happened. They just don't listen nor do they seem to know how to style a dog to their breed. Never heard from them to at least apologize for their error.  There wasn't any concern from the person running the front desk or from the groomer. Very disappointed!!< /review>

<time>1457214297111< /time><Review>Read Yelp reviews, I quit using this place when they left my dog on the table unattended. If she would have jumped she would have broken her trachea. I have heard so many horror stories since then. This is a training school, the people training work on your dog. There is no excuse for the irresponsible behavior. If you see a dog running around in the area, it probably escaped there. When the owner ran her business from her home, it seemed like a spa. Now it is dirty, loud and the staff does not care.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I found this scab on my puppy 2 days after being groomed. #1 The deeply cut my dog #2 They didn't even bother to tell me!!!! I will never go back, my heart breaks that I didn't read the reviews on this place, apparently they have cut MANY MANY dogs. NEVER AGAIN!!! PLEASE CHECK YELP REVIEWS, MANY GRAPHIC PICTURES OF THE ABUSE THAT HAPPENS HERE. Also they charged me early for the subscription I had for weekly baths, they realized the mistake and canceled it yet failed to make me aware. Instead I got a call from my bank about possible fraud.
Another time I took lunch at work to go pick my dog up and turns out they hadn't even washed him yet! So I took my lunch to pick him up when he wasn't even ready!!! They confused him with another dog. Good god what if I took the dog that wasn't mine ?!? No check of ID or anything!!! If I wernt a decent human I could've taken someone's dog! After me threatening to sue them they returned my money but not without threating me personally. An employee told me to watch out that she knows me and my address! I cannot believe I was threatened by doggie spa like this!! So blown away and working on a case with  The Better Business Bureau ! So many claims against them it isn't even funny. But don't take my word for it! Check Yelp!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_id>101698898964798731833<//user_id><Response>None<//Response><time>1455003435983</time>< user_name>

OMG
I didn't know you could learn to groom from a mail order correspondence course
If all they know how to do is groom Yorkies then they should tell the public
I brought my two labradoodles in for a bath and clip and a trim
I told the girl that  I wanted the $22.00 service
They had gotten up on the hill so yes they were dirty (that's why we're here) She told me there would be a &7:00 extra charge because they were extra dirty ? which I had no problem with
My problem :  when I explained what I wanted there was no mention that the $22:00 dollar sevvice she suggested over the phone was now going to be $45:00 She neglected to mention that the service we discussed did not include the clip
Secondly my dogs do not resemble the dogs I left there AT ALL
They look rediculous
I'm not sure what they did  to them they shaved their faces down to skin almost not the same length across either
I do know my 9 year old kid could have done as lousy a job as they did
WHAT A JOKE
They don't look like any breed I know of
THIS IS THE LAST TIME they will get my money
I will make sure any dog lover I meet hears this
A visit for two dogs that was supposed to be $45:00 ended up being $90:00
The ten dollar bill I got back from my $100:00 went straight into my pocket NOT the tip jar
Let me give the rest of you a tip
STAY AWAY
My wife just pointed out that their nails didn't get clipped  no bandanas and the privacy shave is literally 6 inches by 8 inches
WHAT A JOKE!!!!!!!</text>

I will never go back.  I brought in my sheltie and poodle to be groomed on the same day.  I told the young girl who greeted me exactly how I wanted each of them groomed.  When I arrived to pick them up I realized they had given my sheltie the cut they were suppose to give my poodle.  they shaved my beautiful longhaired sheltie down to her skin.  The only explanation I got was Gee I thought that was a strange cut for a sheltie. When I asked why they didn't just call me to confirm that was really what I wanted I just got blank stares.  I am furious with them especially since the groomer has worked on my sheltie several times and knows exactly how I like her groomed.  My lesson is always talk directly to the groomer< /review>

<review>Eddie's is the best. EVERY barber is skilled and will not disappoint. Eddie usually has a long line of customers and he is worth the wait but don't be afraid to go with any open chair. You will not be disappointed. Eddie is my barber but I'll go to the first available open chair and be in and out quickly!<//review><name>Rescue Medic< /name>< Rating>

I've never had a bad cut at Eddie's . He's been my personal barber for well over 10 years. Now I'm taking my son to him! In fact, EVERY barber at his shop is fantastic. If Eddie is on vacation or has a day off I can easily go to whoever is working and they will hook me up!< /Review>

Had been here before with no issues. Two guys cutting hair one of whom was the owner. They usually work through their clients at a reasonable pace. However, my last visit was absolutely the worst visit I've had at a barber shop. First of all I went in on a Tuesday thinking there would be less people but that was not the case. I only had about an hour or so and I had to get back to work. But to my dismay a couple of people that I could of sworn got there after me go their haircuts first, one with the owner and the other with the other barber. I stayed cool and tried to be patient as much as possible since I would be next. But then the other barber said who's next? Like he did not know it was me. An older gentleman quickly jumped up and without even giving a second thought took him over me. One could say well you should have said "Hey I'm next" but given the fact that they had taken two guys before me I was confident they knew I was next. Part of me stayed quiet just to see how much they really cared about the order. Turns out they don't. As a side note, most if not all places know who's next and let the customers be free of the guesswork. Once the owner (Eddie) was done with his client he looked at me and grinned and said "I guess you're next". I'm thinking really? Now you're keeping track. It was too late to get a haircut because by this point it was already two hours and was late for work, but I wanted to let him know how dissatisfied I was with the service. I walked out and will not be coming back ever.  If keeping track is difficult then I suggest a number system or a sign in sheet but I'm not going to be arguing with other customers on who's next when the barbers should know.</text>

Came on a monday... 2 employees. As soon as I walked in, the girl in the last chair helped me out. Wasn't so talkative, she didn't show me how my hair looked at the end but the guy next to her seemed really nice.

I've been here before but it was awhile ago. This is usually my backup spot from..... Overall, okay. I didn't feel like I got a good cleanup as I would where I usually go for the same price.

Also, you guys need to update your pricing on the board and not have false advertising.</Text>

<review>This young kid who talks to much gave me the worst cut ever. I asked for a low fade. A number 3 on the sides. He gives me a super high fade with no 3 on the side. He freaking gave me a zero. I asked for a 6 on top he gave me a 3!!! What the hell. Do you not listen to the customer?? I feel embarrassed to walk outside. If he was paying attention to My hair then talking up a storm with the other barber my hair would of been decent. I'm never coming back here again. If I could give this place zero stars I would. I'm so ticked ticked off at this barber. It must be all the weed this kid was smoking.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Horrible customer service!  Went to this salon last Sunday 4/25/21. Had walked in and this other customer was also behind me. I had asked if you have time for a pedicure or should I come back? The owner who was the front, said “right now, pick a color.” One of the women that worked there , filled the bowl.  The other customer that was behind me was served right away. I thought she was going to start her after she sanded her gel off her toes.

I waited  patiently, while one of the other workers was finishing up a manicure.  Meanwhile,  I’m still sitting in hot water by then, my feet are getting feeling like pruning & itchy. I had to rub my heels & spilled a little water on the floor & apologized. Nothing was said. By then it’s been 20 min.

Other customer was done with her manicure.  Worker went in back. Still the
owner didn’t say anything., lady that came after me was already half done with her manicure. By then I took my feet out of the bowl to drip dry.

The worker was in the back for like 7min.  After my feet were somewhat
dried. I left.

I supposed that they didn’t want my business or they only cater to there regulars!  Very poor customer service!<//review>

Went in on my one hour lunch and Paula was able to take me in and do a great job on my pedicure in under an hour, as a walk-in. Not only was she quick and efficient, I wasn't rushed and she took pride in a finished look, cleaning up all the little areas where the polish ran over. Cool, clean, and relaxing atmosphere. Will definitely be back.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Rating>

If you want to get ingrown toenails from their pedicures, terrible service, and your skin cut, go.
If you want to save your money and health, don't go. There is no benefit from paying for their services. Trust me, their quality of service has declined and their floor is filthy in there.<//Review>

I have gone here twice so far, and I think they did a great job. They seemed to be very friendly to me, and I felt like they took not too much time, but just enough to make sure the work was on point! Last time u went I got a pedicure, and the lady said she could do my hair too, so for $45 + tip, I got my hair washed, cut, styled, and a bomb pedi. Sundays are the best day to go, it's not too busy.< /Text>

<Text>Went into get a pedicure. Someone started the spa and as I was sitting there I looked down there was a roach crawling on the spa. I looked closer and and noticed inside the spa on the side metal piece there Were 15 or more baby roaches crawling out. I was so disgusted and took my feet out. When I told the lady next to me she didnt even move. Nobody apologized or helped me out of the chair. They just turned off the spa. When I told someone at the front she said the owner doesn't do anything about that problem. So obviously they are aware of the problem. So unsanitary!</Text>< username>

The owner made me feel extremely uncomfortable and Unwelcomed, then the lady that waxed my eyebrows did them very uneven where she had to attempt to fix them.

Never coming back.

I will now spend my money at the brand new threading & henna place that just opened up next door.

Service was terrible all around.</Text>

Overall, good. However, not enough care was given to spacing between tables inside or outside. Think COVID spacing. Appetizer and dessert was above average. The steak should have been cooked with a tad more salt to bring out the flavor, but otherwise was good.< /text>

The food and service was really good. Outdoor dining was warm even on a cold night.  Looked at menus online before I went and had in mind what I wanted. Come to find out they changed their concept because of covid, so I was a little disappointed about that. Overall, nice place.</review>

Decent atmosphere here. Outside seating is noisy due to cars on Hwy 9. Food is good, not great. Best item I had was the fries so I guess thats not saying much. Its a good place to relax and chat with friends,  but if you want a nice meal I'd go somewhere else in my opinion. Doesn't mean I won't re-visit this place.</review>

I was planning on meeting a date but he was very delayed. Despite the staff being busy, they did a great job at checking in with me and even making conversation.

The food was ok. The old fashioned was perfect.< /text>

<text>Came at lunch time on a Sunday during COVID-19 era. Plenty of space outside to dine, lots of variety of options to eat and drink. Skewers were delicious, steak was cooked well-done and juicy, chicken had the right amount of spices, shrimp was great. Sliders were amazing, right balance of spices, sauces, tenderness. Highly recommend any of those items and the season fries were also amazing. Staff was courteous. Ambiance was great.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWwhlYYvuLkOKvOA47_HUIBQ5KJDdFtnKODtr7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTMvh6jz47PL0bdLEpWDdLgHyWdvK_vGhJgH--=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-jEiyxpf7mENj-C1FTWFqY5_jECnc6PmKi-zw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK2NK7T8OqgeLLXtlJDXo0brs9hPs_LUDUI93N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPpTi1o-KTLV8eUbmrojRQQuH2Oc44c-oZvC89=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Visiting from out of town and stumbled upon Flight Restaurant. Pleasantly surprised with this American style tapas. Enjoyed the flight of fries and flight of sliders. Tuna was delicious. Salads were refreshing.  Classy environment with an airline themed team approach. Service was friendly and food arrived quickly.  Recommend checking this place out.<//Text>

It was our first time to be there. It's fun place and flights portions are bigger than we thought. Food was good overall. We ordered Tropical cocktail (they are not cheap on alcohol), Salads, Ahi Tuna, and Boneless Fried Chicken. We wanted to order dessert but we became full. Luckily, we went there early with a reservation at 5:30pm before a concert so everything was smooth and be able to get out quickly. Definitely go back there!</Text>

<Text>Great concept! Loved the atmosphere. Probably better with a larger group. Got to try the different dishes. Two cocktail flights for two people too much if you're light weight or out of practice. Service was better than an actual flight and plenty of leg space. Room for carry on luggage is not an issue, but room for drinks and plates is a problem at the 2-tops.<//Text><user_name>VC Wolfe<//user_name>< Date>

<review>Unfortunately the food here disappointed in a big way. I had brussels sprouts and salmon - the brussels were bland, slightly undercooked and underseasoned. The salmon was overcooked and dry, and the small amounts of mashed potatoes were a little burnt and also dry. I wanted to get the IPA beer flight, but they were out of one of the beers (and the selection was meagre to begin with). We dined indoor for the first time in months, but at Flights it was so cold inside that the whole point of indoor dining was gone – I'm pretty sure the guests on the patio were more comfortable. Thankfully the staff was really great, attentive and friendly, partially saving the visit but I probably won't come back here.< /review>< date>

Also I've liked the design of the place - all connected to flights.</review><date>1525066544192< /date>< user_name>

Such a fun way to have dinner. Everything comes in "flights" of three, that is three variations of the same dish. The service is friendly and the call buttons are a great idea, service comes quickly when needed. Highly recommended!<//text>

The theme of Flights is very appealing and the options between drink and food are organized very well.  The food was excellent and very well priced.  We ended our meal with a cheesecake flight which was delicious! I highly recommend.</text>

Located at the start of downtown Los Gatos, great atmosphere and staff. Went for brunch on a Sunday mid morning.Food was delicious for what we had. Ceviche, Bacon cheeseburger, waffles and crepes. All with really good flavors and spices. Bring able to have a really good "flight" of flavors. Everything crossed over very well! Definitely looking forward to going back soon.</text>

Great food and great staff. We love this restaurant. We went once with our son who had food allergies. Our waiter, Jesse, remembered us the next time and talked to the chef to make sure our food was safe for our son.<//review>

Great place to hangout with friends. Love the outdoor seating area. Both food and drinks are served in flights which I love because I like small bites so I can try more options in one settings. The tuna was great, highly recommend!</review>

I like the idea of this place. Having a bunch of sampler plates, but when you get 3 bites and they room 10 to 18 a plate you might as well go to a place that servers full size lunch entries.  We got 4 dishes.  I have to say the 2 pricier dishes we just below average and the ones we liked were the fries (single order) and the street corn tortillas.  I think for ceviche they completely failed and the tiny tortilla chips where greasy and had a taste of old oil to it.  The Stix smaller it chicken in that peanut sauce, beef in chimicurri sauce and shrimp wasn't worth the price. All of it was leaving in some way with the seasoning.</Review>

<review>It was my first time here. First off the customer service was good, everyone was so friendly... server Jesse was so helpful. The only reason I'm giving them a 3 star is because the Mary's Chicken wasn't cooked well. I saw redness inside the meat and the amount of greek yogurt was so little spread over the chicken it barley reached my tongue for the price it was. It normally should cover all pieces not just 1 per my experienceat other restaurants.. Also they didn't provide straws especially during covid precautions. I had to ask for straw. First thing in their menu talks about covid precautions, but yet they didn't provide straw until I asked.  Will I return? Maybe yes to try other dishes that are non red meat or maybe not..</review><rate>3</rate><gmapID>0x808e35ee4b03a399:0x3ded25c54efac275</gmapID></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Not great. We were seated for our 8pm reservation and were not helped until I flagged somebody down. This was at 8:25. After a nice apology our order was taken. At 8:35 another server came out and said the first server was very busy and asked if he could take our order again. Despite our frustration (and hunger!) we repeated our order. After five minutes the server came back out and told us one of the items we ordered was out. That was the final straw. We cancelled our order. As we walked out we saw another group that arrived after us served with food and drinks. Very disappointing!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>This was my first visit to a Flights restaurant and I thought the concept was really fun. Everything they serve is a "flight" with multiple variations of the same dish or drink - perfect for the person who has trouble deciding what they want. For example, the flight of mac n' cheese came with three mini skillets of different types of mac n' cheese to try. The "flight attendants" (aka servers) thing was kind of corny, but I loved that there was a button that let you call if you needed something. I wasn't blown away by the food overall but they get points for the concept.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlJpkG6LIVpNjozAsPrvZXHvw9_g-a1RTtE_iR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808e35ee4b03a399:0x3ded25c54efac275<//gmapID></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Food and service are all excellent here. Prices are reasonable too. You can choose standard tables or the lounge.
Food and beer is delivered in 3s, which is the theme here. I suggest you do a family style and share you various 3-combos. We tend to mix the various appetizers and entrees together and let food come as it is ready. The flavors are really good and often very different from other restaurants. The 3 smallish items per serving means you get to experiment with things you might not have tried. This is now our favorite family restaurant for everything above and the excellent wait/bar staff.
This is so interesting to eat at I strongly urge you to try it</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808e35ee4b03a399:0x3ded25c54efac275<//Gmap_id></record>

I was excited to try this place! The idea of combining tapas/flights seemed perfect for a happy hour with a friend. Plus during actual happy hour it's 25% off the menu!

VIBE: located in beautiful downtown Campbell! Decent sized place with a bar and good amount of tables

SERVICE: how cute that all the waiters are like "flight attendants"! They also give you a card to flip up at the table when you need service or when you're "ready for take off". Kinda cheesy but convenient!

FOOD: if you check in on Yelp you get a free glass of champagne!

Tropical cocktails- pina colada, strawberry daiquiri and mai tai. Don't let their tiny size fool you, these were STRONG.

French fries- truffle, garlic and sweet potato each with their own dipping sauces. My favorite dip was with the sweet potato!

Mac n Cheese- classic, truffle, and bacon/jalapeño. Surprisingly I preferred the bacon over the truffle which wasn't that flavorful.

BBQ Sliders- These were difficult to share since we had to cut these tiny messy sliders in half. But I thought they paired well with the other flights

Overall our happy hour was enjoyable, and our server didn't try to rush us to finish even though the restaurant was getting pretty crowded as it got closer to peak dinner time. I think its only worth it to come here for happy hour because for a couple of flights it added to be pretty pricy (~$60 after tip) and I didn't think the food was that unique, just insta-worthy presentation.<//Text>

<text>Has a great time at Flights.  Cute aviation uniforms and vernacular, family style comfort food.  Here all the dishes and drinks come by default in flights of three variations.  Staff was super helpful and nice. The portions were not skimpy and the food was good.  Drinks good too, but given the local bounty, I do think there was room for improvement there.  I would suggest having a first class upgrade option on the drinks.  Should be easy to pull off and I would have certainly used it.  They have their own little parking lot out back with a couple Tesla chargers.  Overall we loved Flights and we will be back.<//text>< Response>

<review>The small plate flights are a fun way to try a lot of different flavors without breaking the bank or overeating. We shared the fries, stix, chicken, and tacos. The beef taco was fabulous, and so were the truffle oil fries and herbed fries. Our server, Matt, was really nice and explained the family-style serving of food.< /review><time>1584040961531< /time><name>Lezlie Ramsey<//name>< Pictures>

So we went to this place on a Friday night. We had a large group but none of us could drink because either we were driving or we simply didn't drink alcohol. First off the service was horrible.  I buzzed the waiter a dozen times and never got service. We were told to use the buzzer. We complained 3 or 4 times.  We finally got service after nearly 30 minutes. The place was about 80% full and they were clearly focused on customers who order drinks. We were 3rd class citizens.  We had kids in our  party and the kids menu was a joke. Their corn was spicy, full of cilantro. Falafel was spicy. The kids juice Never ever came. The kids pizza was nice and large though. Now the food was pretty tasty, good but really nothing spectacular. It ends up being a bit on the expensive side with the tapas like menu.

< Review>
Great food. But the service was absolutely horrible. Friendly. But just lacked the basics -- took too long to come by and take order,  didn't clear plates after different servings. Table was a mess. Dessert came. Didn't clear. I had to move plates from my table to one next door. Server saw.  Didn't care. I should get the tips. Disappointing. A shame since the food was really good. Great satays.  Hummus was a hit. And good variety on drinks. But service-wise, needs to pick up.<//Review>

<review>I liked the method of service and the restaurant's overall concept. Tables have a button to ring their Flight Attendant as you decide additional items to order.

Flights is not what it used to be, at least not in Los Gatos. Once, they boasted a large menu of innovative dishes, each offered in a trio (a "flight") featuring variations on a theme. Each dish was well-prepared and delicious.  Unfortunately, times change.

Flights had changed hands, and the menu, and food quality, have changed with it.  The new menu still has a few flights, but the bulk of the food is offered in "bites".  This would be fine if the quality had been maintained.  Unfortunately, the new menu is loaded with food that is bland and uninspired. The "Korean" Buffalo Chicken looked fancy on the plate, but it tasted like fried chicken nuggets drizzled in Frank's Red Hot sauce. It was mostly heat and little flavor. The sliders also looked great, but tasted rather plain, even the Chipotle Beef slider, which featured avocado and corn etole. The biggest letdown was the "Reverse Cheesecake" flight that we ordered for dessert. Essentially cheesecake in three jars, each topped with different toppings. The most flavorful part of the entire flight was the Oreo crumble on the chocolate entry.  The strawberry topping was merely adequate, and the mango topping was clearly fermented. The cheesecake itself was loose and bland.

On the plus side, the wait staff was very friendly.  Still, we likely won't be back anytime soon.<//review>

Great experience. Food, presentation, service.All EXCELLENT!

We were even lucky enough to have the owner wait on our table as place was really busy and he wanted to help out his staff. But every server that helped out was always excellent. All the food was perfectly cooked and well flavored.

I normally just like Swedish Meatballs but not crazy about them. But here they are definitely a Must Have. So much flavor you want multiple orders of the appetizer to make it a meal.

Risotto with black truffle oil and mushrooms also an excellent choice.

And if you are a wine connoisseur they have an excellent and varied wine list to accommodate your tastes and price range.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will definitely be coming back the next time I return to Northern California.<//text>

<Review>After having a sub-par experience at the Flights location in Campbell, I was hopeful that the Los Gatos location may redeem this place. I went for a birthday party with a group of girls and somehow the experience was even worse. The food was not good at all (the grilled cheese was especially disappointing- how can you mess that up so bad?), but the service was possibly the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The restaurant anyway expects you to press a button to receive service which is strange to me, but we had to press the buttons over and over to get someone to come wait on our table. We ran out of water multiple times and couldn't get anyone to bring more, we waited a very long time to have someone bring a to-go box, they didn't bus our table until we left basically so as we chatted, there was just mess everywhere, and several dishes came out cold. To top it all off, the event planner told the person who planned the night that we wouldn't need to pay a minimum when she was making the reservation, yet when the bill came, there was a minimum fee added to the bill. When we approached them, they said it's non-negotiable which was frustrating enough, but they also never pro-actively presented the opportunity to us to actually order more food/dessert to meet it so we essentially were all forced to split an extra $250 that the restaurant just pocketed since we didn't know about this minimum until we were all ready to leave. To finish out the series of unfortunate events, the waitress came up to us rudely at 9:30 to tell us we needed to leave because the restaurant had been closed for 30 minutes (again, they hadn't even bussed our table so they didn't seem to be in much of a hurry and there are much nicer ways to do this). I will never return and doubt the 13 other girls will either.

Update: The owner called and asked if they can try to make it up to us which was very kind. Will update the review if we have a better experience!< /Review>< Pictures>

My husband and I have been at Flight's weekly since it changed from the original Hult's.  The service, menu and ambiance are great!  We love doing our weekly date night at Flights!</Text>

Outstanding start to finish.  Food is really great, owner cares that folks have a memorable time here, and the service is excellent, too. Great place to bring friends from out of town. Original menu didn't appeal here very much (so didn't go), but it's since been revised and it's fantastic. Go now (for a special occasion) --</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Food was better than expected but really should be half the price. Sunday brunch was chicken tenders on waffles with reasonably tasty sauces and Cole slaw. Really good eggs Benedict with BBQ pork or pork belly or bacon. Portions were not tiny. Desserts looked tasty but also heinously expensive. ($15 for three little cups of yogurt?) Expect to spend at least $50 for two. If prices were more reasonable would come back often.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Flights in Los Gatos is far superior to the Campbell location. As I have gone to both a number of times here are my comparisions.
Both restaurants: The whole concept of Flights is very cute and a food lover's dream. The decor is air travel, the servers dress like flight attendants, and there is a call button on your table airplane style. Most of the food/drinks are served in "flights" of 3, tapas style. That isnt to say you have to share and some things, like salads and flatbreads are served in normal portions.
Campbell: Limited seating and food seems to be prepared more hastily than Los Gatos. (I'll go into more detail in my review of the campbell location).
Los Gatos: Ample indoor and outdoor seating, plus bar seating. I've only visited this location during weekday lunch hours and it is never busy, though I'm not sure why. There is also ample parking between their own small lot and the large shared lot behind the restaurant.
Food: Honestly everything I've tried has been good but I most highly recommend the ceviche, steak tacos, and Stix (way bigger than they look on the menu). I don't eat gluten or dairy and there are tons of options for me. Only thing I've tried that I would probably not order again is the sliders, they do have GF buns but they are pretty dry and the burgers aren't anything exciting.

Overall, I highly recommend Flights Los Gatos for business, groups of friends or families. It is also sure to impress out of town guests.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Food isn't very good. Beef skewers were sour, cold. The shared dip plate is a joke. Cheesecakes were pretty bad too. On top of all of this, it's ridiculously expensive for what it served. Overall negative experience, won't be visiting again.<//review>

Absolutely amazing food. Lots of flavor and gorgeously displayed. I personally had the risotto and it was fantastic. Tons of flavor and plated well. Great service overall. Found this place totally by accident after we flew in from out of town, absolutely starving. A little pricey for an out of town tourist, but if you are looking for an upscale restaurant with amazing food, make a reservation to go see this place! The interior design is also gorgeous as well.</text>

In A Nutshell:

-Flights really took off w/ a great idea.
-They serve everything, "flight" style, think 3's.
-With that being said, I was slightly disappointed w/ the service.
-I am not sure the "team" concept works very well when if your plates stack up and each team member walks by w/ out clearing the table, possibly thinking the next team member "might do it".
-As a customer you probably shouldn't have to ask, especially at this place when you know things are going to stack up pretty fast.
-The food itself was good, but can improve.
-The waffles could be warmer and less soggy.
-The bacon and beer flight took too long to come out and the bacon soaks up the beer making it soggy.
-I really liked the eggs benedict flight and would order again.

Overall, I hate writing reviews about service, but for now this place gets 3 stars.  It can easily improve and I will give it another shot.< /text>

Flights has a fun and well executed theme and concept.  The decor is themed to the classic era of commercial aviation.  And everything on the menu comes in flights of three variations on an idea, all distinct and interesting, though you can opt to have only one or two variations if you prefer.  The ahi flight was good though not great.  I was extremely happy with all three variations on falafel, old fashioned cocktail, and cookies with ice cream.  You can probably find better single instances of anything on this menu, but if you crave diversity and variety in your dining, Flights is an excellent choice!< /text>

Wow, Flights is a big upgrade from Hults. Most impressive. The back room is a cozy joint bathed in blue light. The bar is a great place to people watch. The bar and wait staff all look like they just walked off a Hollywood casting call; beautiful, tall, and elegant. Oh, and the food ain't bad either. The concept of three types of everything is innovative and well-conceived. Good place to see and be seen.<//Text>

<Review>Almost everything comes in flights of 3 so it's a fun experience to have. Like 3 different mojitos or three different French fries. Really makes you want to order everything but it is pricey for such a small portion and okay quality foods/drinks. Gimmicky.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Review>The food is good, and fun - excellent way to sample what they offer -  The flights of ahi, cevice, Korean chicken and then the prime steak, very good but not rare as we ordered, and the shrimp with black beans - all quite good. The Maverick cocktail -  bourbon, peach & balsamic - is divine! (the other 3 guests at the table enjoyed flights of bourbon, tequila, and margueritas (all excellent), and then switched to the Maveric. So I say be a Maverick.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808e35ee4b03a399:0x3ded25c54efac275< /GmapID></record>

Hult's Restaurant was an amazing dining experience.  Beautifully decorated, knowledgable and friendly staff.   My husband took me there for my birthday and we have the four course vegetarian dinner.  We brought our own wine, but they have an excellent selection of wine as well. The food was excellent, the variety of food was great and the truffle risotto was amazing....and of course, dessert was superb!

I would highly recommend going to Hult's for an excellent evening with excellent food.  We will definitely go back again.</Text>

When I first came to Flights it was at the request of an eight year-old, so my expectations weren't very high. I'd been to the old restaurant that used to occupy the building a few times, but had never been here. It was very impressive.

The menu was wonderful, with something to fit everyone's needs. One thing to remember is that everything comes in threes (duh), so if you order some margaritas, don't be surprised when they put three in front of you!

All in all, the food was excellent, as was the service. Instead of having waiters bother you every 5 minutes making sure all is ok, you just press a button to call over a waiter when you need one. Perfect. Definitely coming back!<//Text>

I was ignored by the bartender, bartenders, because there were two. 20 minutes after I'd finished everything, the female bartender came over to remove what was in front of me and actually had a problem removing the dishes and glassware because they stuck to the bar do to filthy sticky bar conditions. Not to mention the flies that were protecting their food.< /text>< Date>

I went to the restaurant knowing that I would come out with a huge bill, but this was a little celebration and I wasn't really concerned about the money.

We chose a fairly quiet time to visit the restaurant and unlike other reviewers mentioning that the service was not great, we actually experienced fantastic service.

Food: Because we were going to be paying 2-3 times what other restaurants charge but only getting half the portions,  we were expecting our minds to be blown by the quality and look of the food. However, The food was only OK, definitely not worth the money paid for it.</Review>

<Review>The food was so-so, nothing special, but what really got under my skin is that they charge you a mandatory "kitchen benefits" fee! There is a fine print explanation stating that the fee is because they believe in "fair wages" for their hard working kitchen staff. ABSOLUTELY! By all means do that, but that is a cost that should be accrued by the owner not by the guests. If the employer can't pay his people properly that's not the customers fault. I will NOT be going back sheerly because of the shady business practices!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1519139064658, 'text': 'I’d like to clear up a couple of things. First of all the service charge is not mandatory it’s voluntary and any staff member can with a click of a button remove it.\n\nSecond of all it has nothing to do with being shady. In California it’s legal to share the tip pool with the kitchen staff even though they do half the amount of work. This is a legal way to distribute the income fairly.\n\nIt was important to me to make sure you had the correct information.\n\nHave a wonderful day and I hope we get a chance to serve you a great experience again soon'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>I enjoyed our dinner there, the food was nice and good staff, just not quite *great* overall.

Maybe we were just unlucky, but the AC was out that night, which meant they had all doors open to get some fresh air in, which meant that over the course of the dinner my wife and I killed a total of 3 flies. That killed the romantic mood a bit.</review>< Pics>

The flight concept gives a good variety of flavors in one meal.  However, quality of ingredients varies: beignets are tasty but chocolate sauce is fake-tasting like Hershey syrup. Jalapeno Swiss grilled cheese has clear flavors but Brie apple grillied cheese is bland.< /review>

< Review>
Flight is a new place in the same location as Hults.  The breakfast menu is similar to Hults but with a spin on the concept.  This is not your traditional breakfast place.  The food was extremely good and delicious.  The menu is limited as it does not have gluten free options and if you are a vegan + gluten free - then no luck!!  Their coffee if good...they should think about adding hot chocolate.  The staff if friendly and hope they get the staffing requirement sorted out as they just opened in Jan.<//Review>

We are focusing on quality instead of quantity. Since we only offer the brunch one day a week it’s hard to offer a large variety'}</response>

Staff members are second to none. The food there is great while the drinks are amazing. Matea and Joe have excellent taste in cocktails. Brandon's (B's) food reccomendations keep me trying new things every time I come in. Especially love the sliders and Swedish meat balls  look forward to bringing many parties to come!< /review>

The tacos were good, but eeeh, this place is not good enough for a second visit. The staff was clearly not digging the awful campy flight attendant theme, and the drinks menu was like a list of common Safeway selections. I'm honesty surprised there wasn't a Budweiser flight. Will not be back, Holt's is greatly missed.< /text>

They serve something, poorly, but it is not food.  It is certainly not worth the prices that they charge.  Calamari that looked like deep fried chicken strips from a truck stop, a salad with tasteless tomatoes and a turkey sandwich that is worse than from a school lunchroom.   Do yourself a favor and stay away.< /Text><Time>1485651740801</Time>< gmapID>

<Review>The waitstaff and the rest of the employees were really good and attentive, and the concept is interesting: lots of food where each dish is prepared three ways, with each of the three preparations of each dish being enough for three people (or more!) to enjoy. However, of the multitude of dishes that my party tried (martinis, IPAs, empanadas, calamari, meatballs, shrimp, meat tacos, and cookies), we all agreed that only the empanadas were good and the tacos were amazing. I also really liked the cookies, but the rest of my party likes cookies prepared differently. One *major* drawback was how many houseflies were everywhere, and how they kept buzzing around us and our food and landing on us and interrupting our meal (the were all over the windows wanting to get out but couldn't). Otherwise, would I go back? I really liked that tacos and empanadas and cookies, so maybe.<//Review><rating>3</rating><resp>{'time': 1533967480408, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

Amazing food! I love this stuff.  I heard good things so I had to try it for myself.  My girlfriend and I went ahead and ordered al a carte and everything was amazing.  Wish this restaurant the best.  My friends and family will be told of your amazing food.  The only complaint is the parking sucks.  No offense guys.  It's just true.  But that's hardly a reason not to go.  Besides walking that far made me feel better from gorging over the ridiculously good food.</review>

My wife and I met a few other couples for an evening out and we are so glad we chose Hult's!  I am bummed Google gives you a max of 5 stars as the meal was 10 stars+!  We shared appetizers and every one of them was awesome!  Each bite tasted like a piece of Autumn...roasted squash soup, sweet potato ravioli, Swedish meatballs, pork, etc!  We shared entrees around too...the salmon with caviar was amazing, elk medallions tender and delicious, duck was outstanding with a blend of sauces like we've never had before, etc.  And then there was the filet and NY strip entrees...spectacular!  And then we all shared pumpkin creme brûlée which was soooooooo good, the chocolate sphere which was decadent, and an apple bread pudding with accompanying toppings!  My wife and I are foodies and this place knocks it out of the park!  Service...great!  Food...outstanding!  Great wine list!  Too many restaurant menus look and taste like one another but Hult's is very different and extremely good!  Treat yourself to a great night out...you'll be glad you did at Hult's!</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>This place is OK but nothing special. The burrata was bland at best (and I'm well aware it's not supposed to have a strong flavor but this was literally flavorles). The scallops weren't properly seared and they were served with lukewarm soggy grapefruit slices. By boyfriend's steak was incredible (and, unlike the scallops, came with a sear) but his potatoes were cold. The wait staff were super friendly but there were few glitches you wouldn't expect at a nice restaurant like this (brought us the wrong drink and forgot we had asked for desert menu until we reminded them 20 minutes later).</review>< gmapID>

Stopped here to use the restroom on our adventure to capitola. The staff was sweet and let us. But since the place seemed so interesting we stayed for a drink. Unaware at first the prices on their menu was the price for a flight of whichever drink u choose. I assumed for a just a glass of chardonnay it was 18$ but thats the price for three chardonnays lol so dont be fooled. The staff was amazing in explaining to me and was super helpful in assisting me with what to drink. Their uniforms are legit pilot uniforms which made me want to work there. And the location was right off the freeway making it super convenient. Definitly will visit again.< /review>

Had the Tacos, which were ok. The corn tortillas were dry, and chewy. The Al pastor needs some work, chicken was good. I had an old fashion again just ok. The staff (sat at the bar) were very attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is a step down from Hults but I understand, lower cost menu selection will bring in more clients.

Take 2
Went back this time only for drinks, started with a flight of old fashions. Just like last time they were disappointing, would not recommend. Then I ordered a flight of mules which I did enjoy. The Mexican mule was not my favorite and would not want again, but the other two were very good.  I paid for each flight as the brought them to me and each time I was charged that "kitchen" fee. You would think that since I did not have any food the staff would NOT charge that fee. You should not make a customer ask to have a fee removed the bar staff should Doo that automatically or maybe the software that you use for billing would be set only to add that fee when food is ordered. The service was very good from the bar staff. Sara was the bartender that poured my drinks. Still have work to do, but since I live about 2 blocks away I might go back. I hope they can fix that "kitchen" fee.<//text>

<review>The idea of every item on the menu is a "flight" of three, with the wait staff pretending to be flight attendants is a bit gimmicky. The food is essentially bar food. Okay, but not really *that* good to justify the higher prices.  It's also not what I'd call tapas.< /review><user>111070507606950462221</user>< user_name>

<Review>Ok food, way over priced. Almost everything comes in groups of 3. (Shrimp dish only gives 2 coconut shrimp, which is the best variety, plus 3 grilled & 3 steamed shrimp.)

The food is in-between; more like appetizers, not a meal, but priced like a meal. Nothing was exceptional. Three of us had 3 chicken strips (ok), 3 pork sliders (ok), 8 pieces of shrimp (ok), fries ($11), & 3 sets of drinks (the server said a set of 3 is the equivalent of 1.5 regular drinks, but they're priced like 2 drinks at $18-$19 ea) for a bill over $130 ($150 incl tip!) Really expensive for what you get. Atmosphere is ok, but not special. Noisy.  Service was ok. The model of no single server per table, but all servers serving all tables means no  server table ownership & marginal service. We always had to ask to have basic waiter duties done, i.e. clear plates, water, etc.

There are a lot of better $50 per person, dining options for what Flights provides. If it were really great food & service, I'd happily return again & again since I live in LG. I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately it's a miss as a dinner place.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I have been here a few times. First time was my son's 9th birthday, and everything from service, food, portions, environment, and atmosphere was wonderful.  We choose this restaurant as our usual place for business dinners now because of how great everything went our first time. Everytime we go they never fail us. Thanks to the whole team at Hults.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Lots of button mushrooms. I asked the waiter and he skirted the question. Didn't want to push it as I was out with a friend and didn't want to make the lunch awkward. Nice outdoor patio. Maybe a different experience with a different dish? (Perhaps they were out of chanterelles and forgot to adjust the menu?)</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1475165750068, 'text': 'Hi Loni. Thank you for visiting for lunch. Just wanted to get a chance to explain what happened with your risotto. The best way to extract the maximum amount of flavor out of the Chantrelles is to slow cook them with some cream and make it in to a sauce. We then use that Chantrelle cream sauce to make the risotto.\nThe Enoki mushrooms on top is only there as garnish.\nI am not trying to make excuses and in fact I would like to personally make you a risotto and properly explain and present the dish. Call me at the restaurant to setup a reservation and this dish will be my treat.\n-Alex Hult'}<//resp>

Great service and cocktails.  Food was bland and very small portion wise.

My $12 salad was 7 pieces of lettuce and a few cubes of feta.</review>

Small portions & expensive prices are common among high-end restaurants, which is great, I understand that, but that means everything else needs to be at that standard too. Service and quality were not quite on the same level as the portions and prices, which in my opinion, are flipped.< /Text>

<Review>The quality of the ingredients and the care in preparation really shined through in the main courses. We especially loved the plank filet (and the *amazing* duchesse potato), the duck breast, the mushroom risotto, and the roasted salmon. We also really liked the calamari, octopus, shrimp, and pork belly appetizers. But the Toast Skagen and bacon-wrapped dates (skip the blue cheese) were a little less interesting. The desserts were quite good too. The only real disappointment was the cocktails, which were a little bland and IMO would have benefited from a bit more alcohol flavor.

The 2nd time we went, we ordered two different steak dishes and both were delicious but would have been a lot better if they hadn't shown up luke-warm. Dropping a star until I can confirm that this was an aberration (it *was* very crowded that night).<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808e35ee4b03a399:0x3ded25c54efac275< /Gmap_id></record>

Ambiance was very nice. In my opinion the wait staff had too many tables for the price of the menu and because of this the service was pretty poor. Food was pretty good but it didn't have that WOW factor.</Review>
