It's been years since I stopped at a Pick Up Stix. So glad I did, ordered and they offered to run it out to the car for me. Short wait, order was correct, hot, and very tasty. Glad they caught my eye today.< /review>

I have not eaten there in years. I stopped in on 10/4/19 and had lunch. It was good and I plan on coming back soon and trying a few different things, it's nice to find a healthy place to eat. I don't eat fast food so I will be back soon.</text>

<Review>burnedlean location. Polite staff. The food was not good. Basic chow mein, with an upgrade paid for beef chichen and shrimp. The noodles were greasy and drowned in a sticky sweet sauce. Shrimp was good. Beef tasted freezer burned and was in tiny litte pieces.  Chicken? Didn't see any. Cabbage was sliced super thin and only a couple strips of it in the whole dish. Mom got veggie egg rolls, and they didn't have a normal sweet and sour dipping sauce.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>My food was delicious and I was happy however I went with a friend who has a gluten allergy and told the cashier this when she ordered. She asked them to tell the cook so that there wouldn't be any cross contamination. The cashier went and told the manager instead who then came over and talked to my friend. She again explained to the manager that she has a gluten allergy and would become very ill if there was any cross contamination and again, asked them to notify the cook of this. From there she could see that nobody ever went and spoke with the cook (open kitchen) and then watched as the cook picked up my ingredients  (which contained gluten) and then handled hers without ever changing his gloves.</Review>< Pics>

I really like this particular place because of the connivance of been able to order on line. The food its good I have tried the majority of the rice and noodle options which have a great flavor. but I usually come to this place for the Asian Lettuce Wraps. "They are the bomb". I think this appetizer its great specially on a hot day or warm night.</Text>

Overpriced bland taste. Those who review high probably never try other Asian food. There's plenty around to compare and greater than pik upstix. Even cheap panda is greater than this joke of Asian imitation fare<//text>

<review>Order two entrees and some spring rolls and Toto be 10 to 15 minute wait. 15 minutes later I check to see where my food was and they said it was still coming out. 30 minutes go by and they don't know where my orders at. Had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the cook to make my food. Obviously when it's busy they can't keep their orders straight.<//review>< Rating>

< review>
The staff is very helpful when trying to make a decision. I told them that I didn't want something too greasy, and the immediately suggested two entrees that both sounded very good, so I ordered both. They were a bit expensive, but the quality of the dishes was the finest of any order-at-the-counter restaurant.< /review>

<text>This place has great food but they often mess up the order when ordering online.  Today, I tried to order Firecracker Tofu with white rice and a side order of steamed vegetables.  The order taker insisted that I couldn't have both! Even though, I told her I understood that I was paying extra for the steamed vegetables...we actually went around and around ad nauseum.  I still don't understand why I can't have white rice and a side of steamed vegetables if I'm willing to pay for it.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Absolutely terrible experience. Met with an African American woman (extremely bright skin). Terrible attitude. Would not listen to me. Would not upsell. Walked out with cash meant for the business.  I told her I was interested in more services & it made no difference to her & her little attitude!  I had to argue with them & sent 30 different text messages to 4 different people to agree upon a price for one of their products.  After confirming with a manager,  I call to make my final appointment and was totally would be extra $50 if I didn't accept their treatment!!!  I pursued that same manager again about what we agreed upon. Once I arrived everyone had foul attitudes & the receptionist (female) rolled her City College eyes at me when I asked to use the bathroom after driving over an hour to arrive. Waste of time.<//Text>

I came to Blue Medi Spa for a Brazilian laser hair removal treatment. I have done two treatments already at another spa in Florida, and Blue felt like the best choice in LA for continued treatments... let me say I was not wrong! Everyone from the front desk, to nurse practitioner, and the nurse who treated me were all exceptionally kind and helpful. The nurse practitioner took a thorough history from me and ensured I knew potentially harmful medications to me based on my allergy list before letting the nurse begin treatment. My nurse was very sweet and talked me through the whole process — I never numb and she was very kind even when I flinched here and there. The environment was clean, the ambiance was relaxing, and I will definitely be coming back! There was absolutely nothing this team could have done better in my experience. 5 out of 5!</Review>

Made an appointment there and the front desk was very nice. They scheduled me with Priscilla for a microdermabrasion with lactic. Was the best service I ever got. I tell all my guy friends its a must. Us guy's need to maintain also!! Priscilla was really cool and friendly. She explained how I should be taking care of my skin on a regular basis. My face looks and feels great! Thanks Blue and thanks PRISCILLA!< /Text>

My aesthetician Priscilla was great!  She provided me with one of the best facials I've ever received. I think I have found my new skin care spot.  Staff is professional and very inviting. The spa is also very clean and accommodating. Would recommend.< /review>

I I recently went in again to see my favorite aesthetician at Blue, Priscilla. This time I went in for a endermologie on my legs. Prisilla once again made my visit extremely painless and I already have seen results! She made the appointment super relaxing and is extremely knowledgeable about the treatment which always put me at ease.  can’t wait to go back and see her again for all of my treatments!
Also, a big shout out the the two front desk receptionists, Melissa and Karla who are always super friendly and accommodating to get me in!</Text>

<review>Warning: Baby Talking Receptionists

I’ve been going there on and off for fillers for years. The spa is always immaculate. Everyone I’ve seen there has been extremely talented. The only thing that bothers me and is the reason for I’m giving them 3 stars instead of 5 is the front desk.

I’ve been away for over a year and I had questions about peels so I called today. Suddenly everybody at the front desk has a baby voice. I had to call twice to just get a baby voice I could understand. Last week when I called about availability that woman had baby voice too.

Not only are baby voices off putting and annoying; they’re bad for sales especially when you ask a question about a new procedure and the reply you get is this high pitched, very fast, put on, baby voice that’s more suitable for small animals.

Today from what little I could understand of what the woman said, I’ll definitely be going somewhere else for my peel. I’m also thinking about canceling my filler appointment next week.</review>< name>

Hope was so sweet and she made sure I was comfortable. it was my first time at Blue Medi Spa as well as seeking treatment for Juvederm. I am so satisfied with the results, my lips look naturally plump. I can't wait to return for a touch up but also try other services they offer.< /review>

I came to Blue for a consult to treat my under eyes. I've had a huge insecurity when it comes to the loose and hollow appearance since I've hit my 30s. Unfortunately I was that person that didn't listen to everyone around me to start taking care of my skin at an earlier age. In my eyes (no pun intended) I was invincible. I finally decided to take care of myself and I'm SO happy that I did. Blue put me on a skin care line that I'm absolutely in love with. On top of it all, I decided to treat with just my under eyes with the Thermi Smooth and OH MY GOD - I am hooked. I'm already seeing an improvement and I know it's just going to get better from here. Thank you BLUE for being the best!!!!</Review>

< Review>
Do not get a cortisone shot. Not worth the risk of having the person make a mistake and cause a permanent divot. Did this a few times here and I would usually get the treatment done by a girl who seemed careful and had a good sense of what she was doing. This last girl I got was much less careful and I should have not gone through with it. I questioned the spot she injected and assured me that they have never had an issue with causing an indentation. Two weeks later, a big dent formed right where she put a careless shot. It's permanent scar that I had to seek a cosmetic surgeon for to perform a subcision and inject a permanent filler in to correct it. Blue medi spa told me to “massage the area” and offered a temporary filler. My warning: avoid any needles near your face at all cost, it's not worth the risk no matter how big or small of something going wrong. If you must, go to a real dermatologist and not a pop up.< /Review>

I visited Blue Medi Spa this morning for laser hair removal, and got the best treatment imaginable. I received my session from one of the nurses -Sandi, and was very pleased. She is very professional with a delicate hand, and I will book all of my future appointments with her. She explained to me all the possible side effects, and proper after care regarding the laser, and answered all of my questions without skipping a beat! Oh and when I was done and on my way out I stopped to use the bathroom, and WOW! Cleanest bathroom Ive ever used. like ever.. Go Blue Medi Spa!< /review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Very pleasant experience.

Miss Dani has a slight obsession with underarm hair and want evey single one of them removed. So an appointment was booked for a laser hair removal treatment. The spa was extremely new, clean, consisting mostly of contemporary white or clear decor. I was lead to a cute room on a comfortable bed while this pretty lady worked on me. The laser she used was definitely top of the line technology and was relatively painless. The whole process took less than 15min.

I really love the bathrooms here, and no it's not weird at all.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I have done Hydrafacials before in the past, but at regular day spas. When I saw that Blue was finally offering it, I booked my appointment right away. I had Racquel as my Esthetician and she rocked!! She was so knowledgeable, sweet, and aggressive!

I received a chemical peel from RN Sandi Holland recently. I found her professionalism, tact and candor to be refreshing. She told me what she thought would be effective for my desired goals. She didn't recommend services which she felt would no achieve my desired goals within my budget.

When I require additional services I will seek her out again.

Thank You Sandi! ;-)</Text>

LOVED this place! The entire staff of Blue Medi Spa was very accomodating and super sweet throughout the whole process. I got an appointment the same day I inquired, and I was in and out within 30 minutes - super easy and fast! I would recommend this place to any one who is nervous about where to go for their first time - this was my first time and they were extremely professional.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I managed to get a same-day appointment for a cortisone injection today and the whole process couldn’t have been smoother. I think I was done with everything in about 10 minutes.

The receptionists were very helpful and the staff member who did the actual injection was extremely friendly and professional.

I’ve been here a few other times and everyone here has been nothing but helpful.

It’s very clean and they’ve always done a great job. They made an otherwise unpleasant task actually enjoyable. I highly recommend it here!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>After researching all my local medical spa options, including plastic surgery and dermatology offices, I decided to go with Blue Medi Spa. There overall reviews were great and gave me some good insight, on how other clients like it, and I LOVE their website!! The girls at the front desk were beyond sweet, super knowledgeable and got me in sooner than expected (yay!) My provider, Hope, was nothing short of amazing. She's SO sweet and helped me with my minor anxiety since it was my first time doing anything other than just a standard facial. It's been over a month since I did my last PicoSure Laser, and recently just did my fillers and Dysport, and I am 100% percent happy! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND COMING TO BLUE - I'm forever hooked!!</Review></record>

Horrible Experience! A few years ago I tried lip filler in lip. The syringe broke and my lower lip was injured. Dolly, who was giving the injection poked her own finger with the syringe after it broke, ripping into my flesh (I was so swollen i could not leave my house for 2 weeks.)  Dolly began calling my home and interrupting my time with my young children, very emotional demanding i get an AIDS test as she had been poked when she harmed me with the injection. The owner also started harassing me about this. (I was absolutely no risk given my personal situation.) I finally got a test and proved results to get them to leave me alone. My OBGYN was furious for me when i told him the story. He explained it was I who should be demanding a clearance AIDS test as if this tec "Dolly" had been exposed to my blood by her error or the error of their syringes, then I was exposed as well. I gave this business my results but they never gave me the results by technician Dolly.  they were horribly unprofessional and shaming to me. To this day I have not been properly apologized to and the staff is incredibly unprofessional. I am considering seeking legal help for this horrible situation. Do not go here. There are so many better places with far more professional and kind staff in the greater LA area.<//Text>

They can’t wait you’re late , even ten minutes so they can charge you ridiculous fees . and during the treatment they try to sell you more and more and more treatments making you feel like if you’re falling apart. The worst experience ever.< /review>

Love my results that I've seen from my Botox and Juvederm treatments.
I was a bit skeptical about going somewhere, other than my Dermatologist, which I've been seeing for years for my Botox, Fillers, as well as my skincare treatments.
I started going to Blue MedSpa about a year ago, and I have been stoked with my results!!!
Christine and Hope are nothing short of amazing.  I love their knowledge and expertise.  They have the most amazing bedside manner.
I also see Racquel and Andrea for my facials and peels, and absolutely adore them as well.
I'm so happy that I found Blue. They have a lifer with me!<//text>

Blue Spa is the most rude, dishonest, spa I have ever been to!
They overcharge clients and have no idea what they are doing! The owner Ronda NOFAL HAWARA claims she is a plastic surgeon has no care or concern for the clients and only cares about the money! She is a horrible human being.
They have several lawsuits against them and have been investigated by the State Medical Board!!!!
BEWARE OF THIS SPA IT IS A SCAM AND THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!!< /Text>

OMG sarap Até, good Filipino food tried it for the first time and mmm sarap! They have a lot food out for you to choose from. Very easy to sea the food you want and order. Staff was nice and helped me understand what some foods were. You will not be disappointed. I am Salvadorean but I think I may have been Filipino in another life. Sarap(delicious)!<//review>

<text>This restaurant is my favored. I go to many restaurants but to this place I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very chummy and the food they place on your table is so flavorful.

Lechon kawaii was ok. Shouldn't be such huge pieces. It's a meat that should be smaller pieces for taste. I hate how u can't get extra sauce they give u a tiny thing of sauce that is enough for one piece only literally. I've asked several times if I can pay for extra sauce they say this only comes with one sauce. They can understand me they just pretend they don't understand.</text>

You can already tell once you step foot inside that the place is kept wiped and clean at all times.  No fishy smell at all...you can tell that exhaust really works in the cooking area.  Food is fresh and smells good.  The tocino is soft and tasty and they have two types of longanisa...I like that!  Breakfast is good price at $6.99...this price is by far the cheapest filipino breakfast I ever paid for.  Hope does not go up anytime soon.</Text>

Called all say and no answer.  When I got there phone was ringing not busy at all.  I ask the person at the register you guys don't answer any phone call because I've been calling all day.  He just smiled.  I guess this place don't need the business.< /review>

<Text>Definitely has the best portion for the price amongst filipino food spots I've been to ($10 for 3 items), the food tasted fresh and the lola was fast with her service lol

Edit: I had to take away one star -- I dont know any filipino food places that don't give you bagoong automatically when you order kare-kare. I've now come home too many times, DISAPPOINTED because i didn't have bagoong when i clearly ordered some kare-kare. HOW.< /Text>< user>

<review>This place is the best! Receptionist is very polite.  They give you a tour when you first come in. The inside of the place looks brand new, hip, and is clean. I went in to see Dr. Casey to remedy constant sciatic pain I was having after going to a physical therapist that was no help. Dr. Casey and the rest of the staff were very friendly. Dr. Casey took the time to answer every questions I had very thoroughly. After the first visit, I immediately felt better (This was just my experience. Obviously everyone’s is going to be different based on your circumstances). The next day my pain was nearly gone and I no longer had problems and severe pain when standing up and walking. I am continuing to see Dr. Casey even after he thoughtfully recommended a colleague of his that was more local to my home. I turned it down after being so happy with my experience at Life Source  chiropractic. I feel the drive is worth it. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good chiropractor.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
My current experience with Lifesource has been amazing.  I feel so relieved to be able to move around with less lower pain discomfort.  I would like to thank Drs: Chase Parlett, Kasey Pierce, and front office Karla for the best way to accommodate my availability with their service.  I also, want to thank my loving care granddaughter Selena Mora for referring me to this wonderful group.  And last but not least...
The most gentle and caring “Mr.  Bone”
Thank you for making me feel good 🙏🏼</Review>

UPDATE 3/29/21: This is my second time around being treated at Life Source Chiropractor and I totally recommend them! Dr. Kasey and Dr. Chase are true professionals and they have truly made a difference. Thank you so much for such a welcoming environment and turning this painful situation into a bearable one!

I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first. Needless to say my thought process has totally changed. It wasn't until recently I realized that nagging back pain I had become accustomed to was now barely there. Thank you Dr. Chase, Dr. Kasey, and Stephanie! You guys make an awesome team!< /text>

When I was searching for a chiropractor after a car accident. I was reading reviews and it was hard to believe that Life Source Chiropractic had 5 stars! But then after going there for a few months, I could see why. They have excellent customer service! The overall feeling of the office and staff is very comfortable.  The doctors are really nice and cool. The best part is they fixed me! Check these guys out and give them a chance. Especially if you've had a bad experience in the past at a chiropractor. They will change your mind  and make you happy.  Thanks Life Source for an overall great experience!!</Review>

<Review>I brought my son to Life Source Chiropractic when he was only three months old after a PT noticed he had torticollis. Dr. Kasey was absolutely wonderful! He answered several questions on the phone and in person. I was so nervous to have adjustments done on such a young child, but Dr. Kasey explained that the pressure they use is the amount of pressure you would feel comfortable placing on your eyelid. He was so gentle with my son and corrected the issue in only two visits. Everyone at this practice is kind and helpful. It is obvious how much they care about their work and their patients. I highly recommend their pediatric services.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>101426734925311614774</UserId.><user_name>Becca</user_name></record>

Dr. Chase is great.  He corrected my back pain only after two adjustments.  Office staffs are very friendly, nice, and they make the office visits so easy.  They are very flexible on schedule and all way accommodating my busy work schedule.  Great job guys.  Highly recommended Life Source Chiropractic.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>After trying so many chiropractors to fix my back. I was recommended to Life Source Chiropractor and Dr. Parlett did an amazing job !

I’m impressed how he X-ray and scanEd my back. He gave me and throughout exam and I actually understood what he meant and how my back can be corrected ( this was never done to me before).

Customer service it’s great and I glad I came here and definitely I won’t be changing chiropractors ever !! Highly recommend< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Three years ago, I injured my back & haven't felt right since. During that time, I worked with 5 different chiropractic offices that each told me that they understood why I was in pain & that they were capable of helping me heal. With each chiropractor I worked with, I felt so excited to hear that addressing my pain was a reality, & that they could help me get back to feeling normal. Unfortunately, each time I was told that, I continued to feel pain & discomfort. I was at the end of my rope, didn't even believe chiropractors could help me any longer, & was emotionally in the dumps due to my constant discomfort.

Then, about 4 months ago, I met Dr. Chase. After discussing my situation with him, he convinced me to give chiropractic care one more chance - I was apprehensive at first but figured, what the heck - let's give it one more try.

After 4 months of treatments, this week was the first full week in 3 years that my discomfort hasn't kept me up at night or affected me throughout my entire day & I believe it's due to the quality care I received at Life Source Chiropractic. Beyond their high level of care, their support staff has been impeccably professional, positive, & helpful. Take it from someone that knows local chiropractors - don't waste your time & energy going elsewhere. Stop reading reviews now & just go ahead & schedule your appointment. It'll be the best decision you make for your health this year.< /Text>< response>

The team at Life Source Chiropractic is amazing! Dr. Chase and Dr. Kasey are both great and know what they are doing. The front desk staff is helpful and kind. The office has been very accommodating when I've needed to change appointment times or cancel an appointment. Since starting in November, my lower back pain has gotten significantly better! I definitely recommend Life Source Chiropractor!<//Review>

Could not be more happy with my experience here. Dr. Chase and his team are very good with being gentle and sensitive. I have had dizziness for years and within one session from what I can tell it has decreased. I had x rays done which gave me peace of mind knowing that I didn’t have any major issues. I can’t wait to return to see more improvement with my condition.<//text>

The ADJUSTMENT: I'm grateful to have met Dr. Patrick Pierce. As a cook in a busy restaurant, I spend 50-60 hours on my feet and Patrick's weekly adjustments help ease the tension and aches that I experience in my feet, neck and lower back from my day-to-day. Over the length of my treatment, in addition to exercise and diet, I've become more flexible and experienced less symptoms of numbness and fatigue. San Marcos is lucky to have such a good listener and motivated practitioner who genuinely cares about his work. Power's on, Patrick!<//Text>

<date>1556826727977< /date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>My past three months here at Lifesource Chiropractic have been amazing! The staff is very helpful with any questions or concerns that you may have. The doctors are amazing as well, people who genuinely love their career and want to help people with their body issues. At the beginning I was afraid going, after coming out of a car accident my body was still in shock and I was worried that this type of physical therapy would take a toll on my body. When I arrived they were very informative, taking X-Rays and showing me the different areas in my body that could be adjusted. After the first month it became a weekly routine coming in and I’ve always felt welcomed and at home. If you are looking for the right chiropractor this is the place for you. I would give more stars but the cap is only at 5, overall an amazing experience.

<review>First time getting chiropractic care and I am glad it’s with Dr. Chase! Was a little bit nervous after seeing movies with crackingchiropractors, but Dr. Chase and his staff are amazing at explaining everything and making sure their clients are educated! First time seeing x-rays of my spine and boy was it off! After throwing over a 50lb+ bag over my shoulder about a year ago my lower back had lots of pain. I decided to give chiropractic care a shot. Today was my first adjustment and I can say that I already feel better! Looking forward to my next appointment!

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Been in treatment since September 2018 with Life Source Chiropractic. I have another 2 weeks to go and I been treated here for half year now. Today March 25th 2019 got out with no pain on my neck and feeling in alignment like never before in my life.
I have only good, very good and excellent things to say about this office.
From day one they all been very professional, courteous and with a bright smile on. I feel like home when come in here.
Thank you Dr. Chase Parlett, Dr. Kasey Pierce and Carla (as well Brittany in the past) the 2 sweet ladies at the reception area.
All of them been so amazing with me all these 6 months of treatment.
I referred you and I will continue to do so because I know your level of care for people, clients, and patients.
I also been treated as a member of a bigger family here, being invited to their few promotional parties and feeling so good to be around all of you.
This is the only place where they actually do an Rx before they start the treatment and have a computerized system in the room where you can see your spine Rx and been adjusted where is needed.
Because of their attention to detail I found out after 10 years from a car accident in the past that one of my cervical spinal process was  broken.
Been to another office before coming here, had an Rx done there and that dr. never saw or made me aware I have an old fracture on my cervical spine putting me to do tractions on that lower part of my cervical spine creating more damage to my neck.
As a CMT I need to function at full capacity and any disalighment can create more stress on my body.
Well here at this office I got realigned to the point of almost no pain.
Thank you Dr. Chase Parlett for your contribution to my wellbeing and recovery.
My gratitude to you.

(Translated by Google) When I came to the chiropractor I was afraid because I didn't know what they were going to do. The doctors educated me on my symptoms and are helping me with the pain in my body. I was in a vehicle accident and I didn't see that I was going to recover but coming to the chiropractor they helped me with my pain and now I don't have it anymore. I am grateful for your help and everything you have done for me.

I thank God because although the accident happened now I feel very good. They treated me very well. They are very kind and I recommend them to all the people who are looking for help with their health.

The sitting arrangements were 6ft apart and gloves must be worn to help yourself and of course mandatory masking. In terms of food, not bad at all for the price.

<Text>Went for the first time since the last day they were open due to the pandemic. They opened on 04/11/21, and safety precautions are taken seriously. There are servers that assist you with servings, but as an option. Plastic gloves, sanitation stations are everywhere, silverware is wrapped, and social distanced seating applies.

The gloves allow for safety when serving yourself, and helps not having to use as much hand sanitizer.

Service is friendly, we just missed having soy sauce on the table, but they provide small disposable 'cups' to serve soy sauce for yourself and take back to your table.

Food is just as delicious as we expected. So happy to finally eat at a buffet 😋🙌

5 stars for cleanliness, food quality, and safety precautions.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Serving a drink with your meal is not important there. Told the cashier wanted a glass of water. Besides her dropping the ball the waitress never came to the table. However, the four patrons to right were offered drinks. Use to come there all the time will not be returning anytime soon.</Review>< Pictures>

One of my preferred locations for buffet food. Visited at eight, it was not full. The service was very sociable and kind. Prices are reasonable I would say. Feeling here is similar to a place in Columbus I liked.<//text>

<Review>food is good on WEEKENDS! During the week the food is cold and taste like left overs and staile, so dont come during the week if you want to come here come on the weekend the only negative is that on the weekends its full, but that means food is gone faster which means warm food is made and better to eat! staff is ok theyre not kind or attentive they just do their job of taking your plate other than that no small talk. the guy at the front desk is plain out just their, he just looks at you untill you tell him how many people are with you then just takes you to your table. if hes in the front desk he should at least say hey! welcome how many people are with you today? or hello how many people,? but no he just looks at you nods his head and expects you to tell him how many people, so their is no warm welcome here, but food is food if you would like to try this place come on weekends!< /Review>< Resp>

I go to this special place once a month since I enjoy the  special atmosphere that is unique to this restaurant. The team is extraordianrillyremarkably loyal and well trained. The service is exceptionally efficient. Most important, the food you eat is magnificent. I visited many times and I was always happy. The expense is honest. I highly suggest this restaurant to all my friends.< /Text>

two days ago was our first time we went to this fine restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the good service, with the high quality  food and booze and with the honest pay. We will no doubt visit there soon.< /text>

Hateful and Threatening Manager, Below Average Food and Ripped-Off!

Our first and also last time dining here. A man at the front desk sat us at a table said he is a mgr who told us $10.99 for dinner and asked what did we want to drink. We said Orange juice. After we finished, he charged $4 for 2 tiny glasses of orange juice without tell us drinks are extra charge. He was hostile, abusive, hateful, and threatening to call the police if we did not pay $4 for 2 orange juice. We feared for our safeties and being ripped-off, we paid and left. We will never return and will tell our family and friends about the hostile Hibachi, stale and tasteless food.<//text>

Great food at a very low price. Fresh variety of sushi, which is made in public view. A huge variety of food, seafood, desserts and fruit. The customer service is great. When a patron is finished with a plate, the staff clears it off the table promptly. The staff will refill drinks constantly as well. The staff is very friendly. I bring my mom for lunch every Monday or Tuesday. I recommend this place to all my friends and family. Food is always fresh and piping hot.</review>

Huge variety. All the food was good & fresh, no complaints in that department. Nice ambiance (around the Christmas season they even have a holiday tree!). Lots of good dessert options: several kinds of pudding, jello, fresh fruit, cookies, etc.

They understandably keep a close eye on people hovering around the food area, but most of the workers were very polite. Lots of parking though the lot does get crowded. Prices are similar to what most buffets around here charge - very reasonably priced, like $10 to $12 depending on what day/time you go. Good sized place with decent amount of space if you want to bring a group.</Review>

The food is certainly very good.  The salad is very good as are the hard boiled eggs.  The beef with broccoli and the chicken with broccoli along with the other chicken dishes are all very good.  The garlic bread is good.  They have fruit, custard, soft serve and small cakes & brownies for dessert.< /Review>

I love this place, good price for buffet. On weekday cost is $7.99 Not including drink..
You can have all kinds of fruits, 4 kinds of fish, they also have chicken, beef with veggies, different kinds of sushi, white rice, fried rice with corn, jopped carrots, salads, and many many more , 3 different kinds of soup. After eating, there are different kinds of cookies and ice cream too. Waiters and waitresses are going around making sure that you can always ask them if you need anything. A lot of people bring their family and friends in this restaurant to celebrate birthdays, and parties. Best restaurant for me. Will recommend this place.<//review>

<text>DO NOT GO THERE! PLEASE! Don't be fooled by the looks of this buffet, sure this place may look nice but, DON'T JUDGE THIS PLACE BY THE LOOK! The food there taste awful and the waiters don't use soap when washing their hands in the restroom, SERIOUSLY I WAS THERE. I been there for sometime and I always get diarrhea whenever I go there. I give this Rating: 0/5<//text>< gmapID>

Complete utter trash. Never in a million years would want to go here again. I wouldn’t even eat the food if someone paid me to. The sushi there isn’t even edible, they don’t use the right vinegar for the rice, the raw fish/sashimi aren’t fresh [definitely not sushi grade] and I’m not kidding when I say it could put you into the emergency room. I have no idea how or why other people rated this buffet anything other than a one star, it might’ve been decent at one point but is definitely trash now. Point being, never ate food this bad, lucky me I didn’t eat the sashimi and overall rate this restaurant a fat -∞ stars. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY NEVER GO HERE, I’M WARNING YOU.< /text>

It's an Asian seafood buffet (kind of).  Lot of dishes here real don't fit into any real sort of cuisine.  Almost nothing here is grilled.  Most of the food is overcooked.  The beef ribs were so tough that they were  inedible.  The same went for the eel in the sushi. Given the low quality of the ingredients, I didn't try any of the raw sushi.  Did want to risk food poisoning.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The food is okay, almost all of it was sitting there so so long it was mostly dried up. The miso soup tastes watered down, the clams/mussels taste old. The dessert cakes are dry. The jello way too dense, all their fish items tasted old and sour. But their beef and broccoli was good, their rice noodles with egg and veggie was delicious, Mom said crab salad was good, potstickers were a tad bit greasy but okay, I don’t think I’ll go back. Also the waiter kept giving us dirty looks and kept watching us eat. It made us all uncomfortable. And when we told the guy at the register about it he rolled his eyes and didn’t seem to care. Also many of the soup bowls were dirty and so were the forks and some spoons. Poor service.<//Text>

After not eating here in years I'm saddened the the food quality has dropped. Most of the food had no flavor or it was cold. I would not eat the sushi here, avocado was brown and rice dry. Won't be coming back here.<//text>

I am visiting this establishment due to a baptism receipt my high school friend is having. This establishment has quite a few issues, my toddler ate the pizza, that seems as if the dough was not properly cooked all the way, few items I did not agree with with the variety of sushi option s given, and names were lot listed as to which was which. Establishment is extremely large, I assumed a habachi name for a establishment such as this has a option of cooking in front of you but its a buffet style so little different here. The hostess was quite intriguing, the hicky on her neck may have fer feeling different when coming to work. Little inappropriate for a work environment.
Bathrooms were horrendous and disgusting they were not maintained and jor were there any handtowls to dry your hands.
Not a well organized atmosphere. Waiters are hosting there butts to keep us happy, and I am grateful for the ONE man assisting a large party of more than 28 ppl.
This place is good for quick bites etc but wouldn't recommend large groups or parties etc. Some food was good cold even though its meant to he hot.<//Text>

Location is in the HK market plaza, with plenty of free parking . This place is good for the variety and price of the food. Really can't complain for the price you pay, don't expect the best and highest quality of foods . Service can be a hit and miss, but I do not really have any high expectations at these kind of places. Great place to have a party if you do not like the hassle of cooking and cleaning .</Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Hmm. It was a buffet experience with no choice. I remember that I did not have a lot of food types compared to other places and I came out with a very simple one-shot. One more thing to remember is that the employees are kind.

<username>Alex C< /username>< Review>
Stayed here once for a personal trip, overall experience was just horrible. The older Asian lady (Taiwanese, I assume) was very rude and racist, not sure why but I assumed it was because of my mainland accent. Microwave in the room didn't work, when I reported to her the lady was very rude and made it look like I didn't know how to operate it, and refused to switch a room for me. I asked them to heat up the food for a few minutes instead but the lady was again rudely only willing to heat up the food for 1 min, not any longer, and claimed that it would burn the food if heating up more than that, and again made it look like I didn't know how long I should heat up my food with a microwave. Same rudeness when being asked to provide a fork.

Travelers, especially Asian travelers, avoid this place please.< /Review>

There's a microwave, toaster, free hot & cold water, drinking water, coffee from 7:30am-11:30am, and $1 sodas inside the lobby. Some rooms have a microwave, and a sofabed/futon. If you need anything, just ask and the wonderful staff will assist you!
I love this beautiful place and lovely family!
This was my late grandparents favorite hotel, and they used to bring me here in the early seventies! I have great beautiful memories of my grandparents staying here!
I definitely recommend this peaceful oasis!

Needs renovation. Some of the units had the new flooring but did not renovate the bathroom. It still looks run down. Even though its a motel at least they should do make it more pleasing to stay.<//review>

I was there for 4 hours and the people upstairs were moving furniture around the whole time... Then doors are slamming.. The worst motel experience ever.... And to top it off, they wouldn't give me any of the $80.00 I spent back! He kept saying HALF DAY n I'm like NO IT HASN'T BEEN HALF DAY ITS BEEN 4:HOURS N THE WHOLE TIME I COULDN'T SLEEP!!!</Review>

<Text>I had checked in room 105 on July 16, 2019. I was attacked by bed bugs or flea all night , the bathroom is run down, the bedroom is depressing. I continuedTo have big  itchy spots in my hand, neck and butt for days. The employees apparently know something , and the owner denied it. Such a stupid place. They should not be allowed to open for business, certainly Expedia should not advertise for them.< /Text>< date>

When I arrived at check-in the lady at the front desk could not locate my reservation through Orbtiz which I had just made that day. So I called Orbit and fortunately, they called the front desk and corrected this.The room was very spacious which was impressive. It was very clean though I did see a long hair strand on one of the towels in the bathroom. I overlooked that and through the strand of hair away in the waste basket.Also, the door knob inside the room came off which, I told myself , can happen anywhere. So I just put it right back in the socket.Overall, Id stay there again.< /review>

< Review>
Absolutely the worst hotel ever.
This place had it all!
Here’s the highlights
- Cockroaches
- holes in the walls
- Graffiti
- Entire room reeked of cigarettes
- Toilet didn’t flush unless you held the handle down for a few minutes
- Didn’t refill the toilet paper
- Went entire (consecutive) days without cleaning our room (also didn’t provide a trash can in room or in parking lot)
- Literally ONE full sized towel provided
- No microwave
- No hair dryer
- No coffee maker
- Lamps held together by duct tape
- Asks for a cash deposit for remote and key to the room
(PS we did ask for a different room and were told to ask later because all the rooms were being cleaned.)< /Review>

NASTY PLACE. Room was full of graffiti, bed had bed bugs, looked like the walls hadn’t been cleaned and it was a room used for druggies. We requested a new room and the new room was a little better no graffiti and nasty carpet but the bathroom was disgusting! There were pubes in the shower, mold, it was just nasty. This place is cheap and the cash deposit sucks ($10) so don’t expect a clean bed, holes in the wall just overall nastiness.< /Review>

<Text>Front desk woman is super nice a friendly.  She gives you a free soda...  (even though on the soda machine it says sodas cost $1.).  You get kindky asked if you would like a free soda, after you are all finished checking in..  I love how no matter what day of the week it is (Mon.-Sun.)   check out time is always 12:00pm. Also this woman at the front desk sometimes will understand hard times & will  help you out..  for  example: it was really late at nigh t and my buddy and myself were checking in to the Kings Lodge Motel and we were  super tired and  we realized that we did not have enough $$ or a debt card or credit card on us to pay for the deposit for the room!!!!  And the front desk woman said its late & you guys are tired,  don't worry about the deposit this time...  We were so happy and greatful.  This woman at the front desk might not speak the greatest English,  but that  doesn't matter. She is a kind and caring lady...  My friend  and I now come here and stay  all the time..  We love  it here at the Kings Lodge Motel and we will always come back here to stay!  THANK YOU FRONT DESK WOMAN!!!!  From,  David  a.k.a. THE ROOM#-108- GUYS,  thank you so much and thank you again.<//Text><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Second To None<//Name></record>

<Review>If you're on a really tight budget then go here. If not find something better.
Here's somethings you should think if you're planning to stay at this hotel:
-smell of smoke/cigarattes in your room
-a really bad room
-not clean rooms
-5 channels to watch from TV
-a sketchy area to sleep in
Yeah pretty much the last time I'm going there.< /Review><Name>Martin</Name>< pics>

Place is old so it's a little ran down of course. But over all fairly nice employees and each room has been remodeled each having it's own unique atmosphere. Coffees in the office lounge for you when you wake up.< /Review>

<Review>This place was definitely not worth the $95 charge for one night stay. There was holes in the walls, stains on the carpet, it smelled musty, faucet   was backed up there was no hot water..  oh yeah and the TV there was no signal there was no channels available.<//Review>< Date>

Blood stains in the bathroom and cigarette burns in the sheets. Absolutely the worst hotel ever. Place is really the stuff of nightmares. Go sleep in a hospital dumpster before stepping foot in this place.<//Review>

I can hear the sound of the spring from the bed when I move. When I got up in the morning I notice the bed frame was falling apart.</Review>

My boyfriend and I got bed bugs from this motel. There was a pube on the toilet seat, the sheets were dirty and had stains on them. To top it off the we were suffocating in the cigarette smoke. I highly advise you not to waste your money at this motel. I felt disgusting all night.<//Text>

First off the front desk lady is very nice but hard to understand unless you speak Asian. They make you leave a deposit for the tv remote and wi-fi which is weird. The wifi wouldn't even connect on any of our phones (there were three of us), so that ended up being a waste of time.

I asked for a non-smoking room when I called in and they said no problem, only to find out the room wreaked with a variety of different smells including cigarette.

Third, the bathroom looks like it's taken from a broken down apartment in New York City. Carvings on the mirrors and counter tops, little to no toilet paper, shower towels were folded like they were clean, but they were dirty. There were toiletry items left in the bathroom from the precious guest.

Beds- this is the main thing used when staying in a hotel...THAT IS the reason most people get them and especially in this area. TERRIBLE. Dirty top cover, hair on the pillows, all kinds of grime on the sheets which also smelled horrible.

I highly suggest finding another place to stay. I would have rather slept in my vehicle.< /Text>

This place sucks it's not clean an the rooms smell. U can hear sounds of doors slaming all night an the parking lot sucks.. Totally not worth the price they charge of 75 buck plus 10 bucks deposite.. An they dont even have cable they do have a porn channel but visability on tge chanel sucks..<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I will give it two stars
But I'm not sure if he deserves it
When entering the room you find cockroaches
Some dead and some not so much
And a bad smell
Like a mix between old and pissed
Dirty bathroom
No room service of any kind
The blankets or blankets
Sting
It looks like old sheep's wool hehejr

Anyway
I do not recommend it
I thought that
These Chinese would be neater when it comes to hygiene and comfort

(Original)
Le daré dos estrellas
Pero no estoy seguro si se las merece
Al entrar a las habitación te encuentras con cucarachas
Algunas muertas y otras no tanto
Y un olor maluco
Como una mezcla entre a viejo y a meado
El baño sucio
No hay servicio de habitación de ningún tipo
Las mantas o cobijas
Pican
Parece de lana de oveja vieja jejejr

En  fin
No lo recomiendo
Pensaba que
Estos chinos serían más pulcros en el tema de higiene y comodidad< /Review>

<text>The food was good, but the service was outstanding! There was a waitress, I didn't catch her name, but she deserves a 5 star rating. Fantastic menu full of options. My girlfriend and I ordered the shrimp Linguini with Alfredo sauce and garlic bread, the tuna melt with potato salad and a strawberry chocolate Crepe with whipped creme and endless chocolate drizzle.. Delicious! This resto has history as well. I used to go here as a kid when it was called 'The Villa', close to 20 years ago. Highly recommended, please enjoy. 😊 Prices are definitely affordable.

Update: Returned for a Saturday breakfast and we had; Eggs, bacon, country style potatoes and pancakes as well as Shrimp Linguine Alfredo. Very tasty!< /text>< Pictures>

Super impressed by their all day breakfast selection. I'm usually hard to win over with breakfast but we'll be back for sure! First place I've seen offer pancakes, bacon/sausage, hashbrowns, and fruit (sunrise breakfast!). The restaurant was very clean and service was excellent. I don't think my coffee cup was ever empty. The rest of the menu looked great too. Will be back soon.< /Text>

<text>I don't know how this place is still in business. After seating ourselves a waiter DID NOT APPROACH our table to ask if we wanted drinks until 15 minutes later. The place was dead there were about 10 other patrons. The food was HORRIBLE! If you are looking for BLAND and BORING FOOD this is the place for you. I will NEVER eat here again. It was pretty disgusting!</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It was a broad experience; We had my son's birthday, they supported us to modify the space. We chose to serve a delicious brunch, with fruits, pancakes, potatoes, bacon, eggs and more all very attentive and kind.

<Review>You can tell why I gave a 1 star. I am sure I didn't order bread with a little bit of stuff on it. Also it was super hard not even a soft crust. Check your pizza! I didn't because it was raining and I just wanted to get home. When you break the pieces up its like 3 bites of actual pizza. Also when I got there all the employees were just fooling around 2 were there just staring at me didn't even greet me at all until someone else came to the front and took my order.  Also I have to call twice to place it because they answered and hung up on me before I could even speak. I've never had this problem with the other little Caesars so I was too trusting. Never coming back to this location again.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWDtcfC1bArBj6klHn6y0jDFY3JhUglHjvmbnL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFr3zAK7wg0qvbtR-gmB49SnjfgSmex7kzAKVZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80e84c14416faa71:0x78972694af13a817<//gmap_id></record>

The pizza is good, but the lines suck. SKIP the line, walk straight-up to "The Portal", flash your phone, walk back out past all the poor buggars who don't know how you did it.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2_VZMYbTw8Ge9Kx94wGuaHd5KDxlELs1kTdAK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e84c14416faa71:0x78972694af13a817<//GmapID></record>

I called to ask if I can get a refund for just the soda but they said i would have to go in for the soda. Whole point of ordering delivery is so I dont have to drive to the store but anyways I drove to the store and spoke with manager Cris. The dude was very helpful! He apologized for the screw up and he even offered a free side of wings because I had to make a drive. Food was great!!

The price of pizza here is always the best over all the pizza places. However, the price is so good that there was a bit of a wait, all the way out the door. So you may want to call and place your order to avoid waiting in line.< /text>

I had a very unprofessional interview. They made me take a math test in front with all the crowded noisy customers the supervisor looked very nervous and was sweaty as if he didn't want to be there he was stuttering and couldn't explain good. Last thing is they never gave me a follow up smh< /review>

I like Little Ceasars Pizza. I think it is one of the best. The staff at this location was friendly and the restaurant was clean. I bought a cheese pizza, crazy bread and sauce all for about $10. It was a quick and easy dinner!< /review>

The last 2 times I have been into this place it has been over a 20 minute wait you would think they would have some pizzas ready at lunch time and at dinner time at the rush Domino's can have it to my house faster than they can make it. My guess is poor management.</Text>

Pizza is good and affordable, but the concept of "HOT-AND-READY" is a joke at this place. Minimum wait to get a pizza is 15-20 minutes. Sometimes the wait is 40 minutes, which is ridiculous. That's why I don't buy pizza there often. It is really disappointing.<//Review>

Thin pizza promoted as "Hot and Ready" from 4pm-8pm. Went with my daughter around 5pm, NO PIZZAS READY. Not thin crust, NOT the regular pepperoni or cheese, NO extra most bestest, NO bread. NOTHING. On a Wednesday. Was told it would be a 45min wait for ONE PIZZA, only 3 customers waiting in the store. Ridiculous!<//Text>

Poor quality pizza very dry, waited really long, bread sticks took forever . Workers stand around. They literally gave the breadsticks out  and we were waiting before them.. sad because i worked at another little ceasers and wasnt like this at all.. i know how long breadsticks are supposed to take. Hopefully they fix there mistakes..<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>The worst service you can expect! I understand your getting a cheap pizza yet have them ready when you advertise a few of the variety to be ready from 4pm to 8pm. I have gone once every week for the past three weeks with the same response we sold out. Yet if there is a line and you wait 10 to 15 mins, because there's only one cashier or if there is no line you have the same response. It's a joke and ridiculous. I have learned my lesson I will just order a pizza from Toppers they are better and take the same amount of time to make.

Note: If you ask for a corporate number they say to look on  line. They are too busy or arrogant to provide the number. I just googled Little Cesars customer service complaints and what do you know it popped right up!  I am assuming I am not the only one complaining. I left a message we shall see if I get a response.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I honestly like the deep-dish pizzas & wings from this place...yummm, just one big problem: Every time I place an order to go pick up later, they ALWAYS say my order will be ready in 15-25 minutes. I go pick up at around 40-45 minutes later, I get there & my order is still not ready; they tell me its going to be an additional 10-15 minutes...20 minutes later its finally ready. So basically, it takes them 1 hour to have an order ready...IF THEY DON'T GIVE AWAY MY ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE too, because it has happened!!! Soo much for the 15-25 minutes they say, its BS that there always waisting my time & over-testing my patience at this place for a damn pizza & wings. I've cancelled & ask for my money back half of the times too for exactly the same reason, this is why this place gets a 2 star from me...they could easily get a 4 star but they seemed not to want it. ( This does not apply to the Hot & Ready that they always have, I custume make my order & place it; otherwise I would always be in & out of there all the time ) .</review>< pictures>

Most often have huge waits of 20+ minutes for any kind of pizza so not Hot and Ready. Their pizza is great like most Little Ceazars but still inconsitent. Sometimes undercooked and very greesy.

Update: They stepped it up. Been having great service.< /Text>

It's a Little Ceasars so...they almost always have hot and ready cheese and pepperoni pizzas for just $5. If that's what you're looking for, you're in luck. Pretty decent pizza at a great price. Not much more to say.<//Review>

<review>It's ok...it's Little Caesars. I don't really have anything bad to say, they are just average. They gave me the wrong pizza once and I didn't know until I got home. We go there quite a bit...this one is ALWAYS crowded at mealtimes though...always a line.

Update: I'd like to lower my rating actually. Unfortunately my son likes to go here after work and grab a pizza...but the wait is HORRIBLE. There is ALWAYS a line out the door, and no matter what, they always have to make your order and they tell you 20 minutes, but it's a half-hour at least for sure. Every time.< /review>< pictures>

My last 2 visit I walked out without pizza. I just don't wait 15 minutes to get a classic pepperoni. They offered something for a dollar more. Please raise the price, but don't play this dirty game.<//Text>

Horrible service called in a order and repeated it back to me and still got it wrong even though the receipt showed my correct order then proceeded to argue that we ordered it wrong and laughed and did not offer to remake it until i said i didnt want it after it was made wrong will never return to this location such crappy worker's need to work on customer service.< /Review>

<review>This place is absolutely amazing. I just brought my almost 2 year old son in for his first appointment today. My son is pretty attached to me, he doesn’t like the doctors office, so naturally I have been terrified to bring him to the dentist. My son got his teeth looked at, cleaned, and treated with no tears no screaming no tricking him into it. They were so helpful and gave lots of information. I can not recommend it enough !!!</review>< pics>

The office placed some type of restriction on my Son's account! I am a busy Doctor who truly appreciates and respects Doctor' s allotted scheduled appointments . Unfortunately, a few weeks back I had to cancel my son's s appointment literally hours after it was made! His transportation had an emergency and we made sure to let the office know morning of the appointment.  Placing a restriction on his account so he can only be appointed for morning appointments seems a bit irrational.  Every parent has had to change their schedule  and endure all the extra responsibilities for their children. During this Pandemic...I certainly would show more compassion . Terrible management! Truly utterly disappointed.
My children  and I actually  liked Dr Rex but hope he will re evaluate  his managing staff  and not to ban a child from afternoon appointments  for missing one appointment due to unforeseen  circumstances!
Our time  as a medical  provider  is important  but to have a child banned for 12 months of afternoon appointments is unheard of....<//review>

<Text>I bring my 3 young children to Dino-mite Kids Dental and they all love it.  My oldest, 7 years old, has had cavities filled, and teeth sealed and still loves going.  Dr. Rex is great at distracting the kids during what could be considered an uncomfortable procedure.  My son still doesn’t know that he got shots when his cavities were filled!  It’s a friendly office.  I am grateful to have found them.  This was the third dental office I tried for my kids.  We have been going here for a few years now.< /Text>< pictures>

My daughter & I love Dino-mite Kids Dental!  On the way to her appointment she said she likes going to the dentist & that the "nurses" (she just turned 7 & thinks the staff are nurses because of the scrubs they wear) are the nicest around!  From the time you walk in you feel welcomed & heard by all the staff.  We will happily continue going to Dino-mite Dental & recommend it to all of our friends & family with pediatric dentistry needs!< /review>

<review>My daughter has been completely terrified about going to the dentist.  The dr and staff were so patient with her and talked to her the whole time, explaining every detail of the appointment and letting her practice her dentistry skills on a toy before they did anything.  With each appointment it gets easier and easier because of how sweet, patient and gentle they are with her.  The waiting room is fun and they have TVs on the wall to watch while you are getting a cleaning.  So happy we found this place!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Price is great, dental care is great. Nice waiting room with toys. My 3 yr old had a fun experience, her first visit to a dentist. The staff was very sweet with my 1 yr old, too. But the environment was unpleasant for me. I'm very sensitive, but many kids are too, so I feel like people need to know about this. The top things I didn't like is there were TVs in the waiting area and the exam room constantly on, and the dentist Dr. Rex didn't make eye contact with me even when he was talking to me, even though he seemed friendly enough. Also Dr. Rex asked my kid some questions while she was watching the TV, instead of turning it off for a minute to have her full attention! I know that's normal for some people, but it's not the best approach if you want the kid to see you as a trusted authority. Plus they didn't try to teach her about dental health at all. I was expecting they would. Isn't that what dentists all used to do? The TVs, plus people talking, plus lots of prizes, plus me needing to wrangle my 1 yr old of course, made it overwhelming for me and I was so glad to leave. They did help my 3 yr old be comfortable! She is extroverted. I just wish it was less of an...intense experience. I'd prefer the good old fashioned type of professional demeanor, not this modern total sensory stimulation they seem to think kids need to be able to enjoy themselves. Next time, I'll ask to have the TVs off more, and see if things go better for us.<//text>

<text>Major mom fail, my son is 5 almost 6 and I just took him to the dentist in July because he said his tooth hurt.  I found this practice through my Insurance and am so grateful that I did. Not only was the staff gentle and kind with my kiddo,  they were gentle and kind with me as i sat there hearing about the horrible condition my kiddos teeth were in. Through my tears i was comforted not shamed, explained the genetic component (his dads teeth are horrible) and encouraged that the past is the past and moving forward we can take care of his tender mouth.  My insurance turned into a nightmare and the biller at the practice was proactive and partnered with me through the whole process from the appointment to his major surgery and after.  The thing ive noticed most is that there is a genuine care for the patients over the money and that is rare,  especially here in Orange County.  I am behind grateful for Dr. Rex and his incredible staff at Dyno-Mite dental.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My daughter sees Dr. Rex and he is patient and thorough and accommodating. My daughter has TMJ and that makes x-rays and cleanings difficult and painful but Dr. Rex stopped many times to be sure she was comfortable and he went at the pace my daughter wanted him to. I've never seen a dentist so patient.  My son just had 3 teeth extracted by Dr. Julie and she, too, was extremely patient and understanding of his nervousness. She explained to me and to him everything she was going to do next.  The hygienists and assistants are great with kids and keep them distracted (if needed). The front office staff is friendly and helpful. I am so glad we found this office.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Rex and team are fantastic. I brought my three year old twins and 1 year old in for their dental checkups, and the appointment couldn’t have gone smoother. With that many little ones, a successful checkup is a testament to how well the office is run and the efficiency of the hygentists, dentist and staff. We’ve been coming since the twins’ first checkup and will continue to do so!<//Text>

Both my girls (12&6)come to this office and both have had a great experience. My youngest (6) is special needs and I'm glad we finally found this office after having really bad experiences at different locations. Dr. Keith does a great job with my daughter with special needs makes her feel comfortable and is always able to calm her down if she is afraid. I can not thank Dr. Keith enough for making my girls experience at the dentist a wonderful experience. My youngest use to be terrified of the dentist, now when I tell her we are going to the dentist she jumps up and down with joy.</review>

< review>
Very clean and warm welcoming office for kids. Dinosaur theme. The staff is so awesome gaining confidence from kids by showing them the tools they use and have them touch them. My 4yr was so nervous walking in. He fell and chipped his front tooth. After a few minutes conversing with the technician he was comfortable and allowed her to do X-rays and clean his teeth with no issues. They play kid movies, (Cars was playing at our appointment time)on the TV's that are hanging on the side and ceiling. Dr  Rex was amazing. He was very nice, cool on gaining confidence with my son and great bedside Manors. After the appointment, they give our goodie bags containing a toothbrush, tooth paste, and stickers. He also got a balloon on the way out. I highly recommend this place.< /review>

Very friendly staff. The doctor does a great job of connecting with my kids (8 & 11). He’s is  very thorough and explains in great detail the what’s and the why’s, in a way that my boys absorb the information and fully understand it.< /Review>

Staff is really nice, they’ve got iPads in the waiting room, and a tv on top of ceiling for your kid to watch/be distracted. They also are really sweet to let the kids pick out a small prize from the little toy machine and they also get a balloon on the way out. Very kid friendly and clean inside.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Our 5 year old Athena and 3 year old King saw a dentist for the first time. We are very happy for our choice. Children love the dentist and are not afraid at all. They have layers of presents and balloons to keep the children looking forward to the next dentist meeting. Before my brother was 7 years old in another dental clinic, it felt bad. He heard his brother and sister came back and said that he was looking forward to seeing the dentist next month!

我们家Athena5岁和小King3岁第一次看牙医，我们为自己的选择非常高兴，孩子们喜欢牙医一点也不害怕。他们有一层层的礼物还有气球让孩子们期待着下一次的牙医会面。之前我们哥哥7岁在另外一家牙科诊所体验了感觉比较糟糕，他听了弟弟妹妹回来说了之前对下个月见牙医非常的期待！</Text>< Name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Midas is the best auto shop in Southern California. Henry and Steve are awesome. I have been a loyal customer coming here for the past 5 years and they have always been professional, kind, and caring people. I have taken my car in multiple times with small issues where they replaced parts and took the time to help me out without ever charging me a cent. You won’t find a more honest workspace than Midas in Tustin, in my experience. Thanks guys!</Text><response>{'time': 1614365466511, 'text': 'Thank you for taking a second to leave us this great rating, Jack!

<Text>David and Steve run one of the most honest business I know, I’ve been going to them for over five years, I’ve sold cars and built cars through them and even taking any car from Highend to Lowe and to them and seen them turn it over. Just amazing how are those simple and clear and concise these guys are very thankful for them.< /Text>< date>

<review>Good overall services at Midas. People are honest and explain clearly the work needed and work recommended. Had to drop in for an immediate fix and they were accommodating.
They are also open about available discounts and coupons so you don’t have to print or chase it on internet.
Good service, helpful people. My go to place in Irvine for any car fix right now.</review>< Pictures>

They are super honest about your car and what's going on with it , and most times will give you the best deal for the labor and parts. As a young woman who has been scammed left and right for car repairs, midas is a place I would come back to solely because of their outright honesty.<//review>

Just left Midas and gotta say I’m very impressed with this location. The team is excellent, great customer service and transparency. They also charged me almost half of what my dealership quoted me for alignment, and they rotated my tires and checked all my car fluids etc complimentary! If you’re in the area, definitely choose this place for your car service.</Review>

Took my car to them because it wouldn't go in to gear. The shop manager refused to work on my car saying it's too hard of a job since they have to work on a part underneath the steering wheel. Took it next door to Purrfect Auto Care and they had the car ready the next day. They were honest and charged me a fair price for a job that Midas refused without even really looking at anything or listening to the issue.<//Text>

I have been going to this Midas shop for the past four years at least and they have never done me wrong. I feel I can trust them with my car repairs and they’re honest about what needs to be repaired immediately and what can wait. They stand by their word.  If they can’t find the problem they won’t just throw parts at your car and make you do expensive repairs they wait until they ensure they have the right solution for your car.  So happy to have a reliable mechanic. Thank you David, Allen and everyone at Midas!< /Text>

MIDAS is an excellent repair shop. I took my Toyota Sienna in to replace the catalytic converter and try and pass smog. It was having a really hard time, but Donald had me keep running my car til it would pass emission and helped me get it smogged. They really care and work with you. I also took in my Hyundai Elantra touring to get checked out after I bought it. They let me know any issues it had without charging me anything. The integrity these guys have amazes me and I look forward to building a good relationship with the company and it’s mechanics.</text>

<text>I have been a customer of this shop for a number of years and they have always done their utmost to help me with my car. David is as knowledgeable and professional as he is kind and compassionate. The first time I visited the shop, after examining my car, David walked me to the back and thoroughly showed and explained to me what the issue was. I became a customer after that and the guys have never let me down since. David truly cares about fixing the problem and keeping your car in tip top shape. All of the guys treat you well and like family. They also give you very fair prices for the quality of work they do. I highly recommend this shop because all the guys especially David are amazing. Thank you Midas Tustin!</text>< Rate>

<Text>I don't really give reviews but I want to this time because I was really satisfied with the FREE service. Yes!!! Free service.
I went to Midas on 11/23/16 to remove the corrosion on my car's battery. When I came in the shop, the man who answered phone calls and attended to customers asked me to return after an hour because he said there were 3 more customers ahead of me. I came back after an hour and there were more people than when I stopped by earlier. I think the shop was really busy that day because it was the day before Thanksgiving, it was the start of the 4-day weekend and everybody wanted to have their car serviced (Hehehe!). Even though it was super busy, the man was still very nice to everyone. Most of us waited for about 45 minutes to an hour for the service of our car to be completed but we all got our service for free. He said he was short staffed so service took longer than usual. He said that service was complementary and treat it as our early holiday gift. How awesome is that! And yes, the crew was able to remove the corrosion from my car's battery and replaced the cap. Thanks, Midas!<//Text>< pics>

These guys do a great job at making sure your car is properly taken care of and on time.

Several times I've asked them if they could get my work done within the day and they've stayed after working extra to get my car done.

Not to mention they are pretty fair with their prices.< /Review>

<Review>Excellent service caring and conscientious. I left my car there overnight so they could start it cold in the morning to discover a rattling sound and vibrating I could not get rid of after I took it to a couple other places that couldn’t find anything wrong. The others said it was a muffler issue and after being checked out here and showing me the underside of the car up on the rack with no carbon or signs of leaks they had asked to keep it overnight so they could start it cold in the morning which is when I said I heard it the most.  I agreed and left it there. The next morning they called me after hearing the vibration I discovered it was a couple of bolts missing from a fan in the engine. I asked how much for their time and labor and they said no charge,  and also told me what they found the car will be needing in the future
I was delighted with their service and honesty

<review>Always go there for oil change and tire rotation. Great price without pushy sales and friendly staff makes me feel good. A visual courtesy check list helps me understand what service might need in the future and I appreciate technician's notes. I trust them and nothing wrong in my cars for long time.<//review>< date>

While I was there I thought the service was great. The next week, I  called to make an appointment to get my A/C checked out. He told me he had to order something and would call me back..never did. I called 3 weeks later and someone else told me other guy was having personal issues and HE would not only give me a discount,  but have someone call me that day. Never did.</Review>

Professional, funny and fast. I was trying to drive from Orange County to Tucson, AZ, but started the trip with a low tire pressure message on my dash. When I arrived at the service center they found a screw in the tire. Although they were very busy, they got me in and out in 10 minutes and didn't charge me a cent! I would definitely recommend them!<//Text>

Was going to ask for an oil change cuts me off when I say "I need an oil change..." Tells me we are booked til monday. So cuts me off doesn't attempt to look at booking to see if there is a chance to squeeze me in. Just cuts me off we are booked til Monday and tone was indifferent as if to get rid of me as fast as possible.</review>

If you have a whole day to waste, then I recommend coming here. It took me almost 2 hours for a simple oil change, and I was the 2nd customer in the store. I ask for a brake estimate and they want to charge me like $300 - $400 dollars for some front brake rotors that I can get on eBay for like $50 a pop. It's just a rip-off center and has absolutely terrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend coming here, unless your into horrible customer service and getting ripped off. 😖<//Text>

I'll be the first to say that I know absolutely zilch when it comes to cars. So of course that means I am at the complete mercy of whoever I take my car to. Everytime, it's a blind leap of faith, hoping that the place is an honest business. Today, I am so glad I took that leap here.

I went in because my dying battery needed changing and the corrosion was so bad, it was a miracle there was any connection. In fact, I'm pretty sure the corrosion was all that was holding it together. Both the guys that helped me were super nice and friendly. I waited maybe 15 minutes to have the part replaced and the new battery put in. Best of all, it was super affordable for me as I'm a student, so every penny counts. I will definitely come back!<//text>

<gmap_id>0x80dcdc6b068b32e1:0x3c3b15566912a805<//gmap_id>< Review>
Absolutely horrible experience.  It’s Christmas-time, two young daughters to get presents for and retired military and that didn’t keep Marco from fleecing me for $638.78 just to replace the alternator that AAA had already determined was bad.  Not being unfair, I say fleeced because I called my wife’s mechanic across from her job and for the same work he quoted me $275.  I then did a google search for the same repair and found the same quote for around $275.  Unfortunately, AAA will not tow from shop to shop!

Here in my opinion is his setup…Marco says worst case scenario this is going to cost you $638.78 but I want you to authorize (buy) and new battery for $139.99 because that might be the only problem.  I say ok and then he returns with the test showing what AAA had already determined.  I tell him about my concerns above and the lower quotes mentioned above.  He talks about how he has kids to but he doesn’t budge on the price.  We both know I am screwed because by the time I pay to get the car towed elsewhere I am going to be out more money.

To add insult to injury they broke my speedometer and the mechanic that worked on my car started to argue with me that it was already broken.  Marco cut him off and then tried to imply that AAA broke it during towing.  I reminded him that the car was delivered on a flatbed tow truck.  He asked to keep the car for another day to talk to I believe the owner.  I arrived today (no call again from them again), Thursday, and the car is parked.  I peek inside to see the speedometer is fixed. I go inside and was happy to see Marco was not there.  I asked the person at the desk if they had reassembled it and he said they disconnected it and reconnected the speedometer and it resolved the problem.

Oh, and while I was waiting for an hour and a half on Tuesday while being fleeced I overheard a customer telling Marco that his flat repair was supposed to be $10.  Marco shot back that flat repairs are $20 at this shop.  The customer said that the manager who was there in the morning told him it was $10.  The individual went outside and I guess Marco had someone call the morning manager because they yelled from the back office that the price was $10!

Communication was horrible.  They never called me on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  I had to drive to the shop to find out what was happening.  I will never set foot in this place again.

Please see attached pictures.  For $139.99 the battery should be spotless.  Notice the considerable about of dirty on the batter that has obviously been sitting exposed somewhere for a considerable amount of time.  What did they do to my weather stripping?< /Review>

These guys are just awesome. I came in for a tire alignment and left the car overnight. The tires were "technically" aligned but still wearing wrong. Any other mechanic could have just charged me and done nothing. The owner, Allen, aligned the wheel for free. They say 60% of money paid for auto service isn't needed. These guys are the exact opposite.</Review>

DO NOT GO HERE!!! The manager is an idiot. Brought my car in for service, said they’ll call when it’s done. Shop closes at 6, still no call at 530 so I figure head out there, should be done soon since the shop is closing. Go out out there sit in the lobby for 10 mins no one comes so I go out to look at my car and they didn’t even touch it, same tires and everything on it. Go in and ask what happened and he doesn’t even say anything just says here’s the key take it. Car was there for 4 hours and not even looked at, no call, no my bad, nothing. That guy is a POS< /Review>

The work has been exemplary: new muffler on my 1987 Mitsubishi Mighty Max is super quiet. The engine is now more efficient and the vehicle easily passed its smog inspection (after being rejected before the muffler). The cost of balancing my wheels/tires, inflation to the correct psi, and replacing my wipers was 33% lower than Pep Boys, done in less than 66% of the time quoted by them, as well. My highway mileage has increased 25%.

The attitude is one of professional demeanor, yet uber friendly and personable. A rare quality in service these days.

This location is quite a find, especially if you live within reasonable proximity. I trust them completely and look forward to using them in the future for all automotive maintenance, repairs, and upgrades.<//review>< pics>

This location is now under new management and they have cleaned house. Alan, who is the new GM here, has personally taken the responsibility of turning this shop around and he is doing a wonderful job. He is very honest on what actually needs to be fixed and what you can avoid spending money on. I've taken both my high end imports (Jaguar XJR & Mercedes S500 here for a full service (synthetic oil, coolant, tranny, rear diff, brake fluid, pads, air cleaner, steering fluid etc.) and they did a excellent job on both. I paid 1/4 the pricetag I was quoted at Bauer Jaguar and the Benz dealer. I was very satisfied with the quality of the work as well, both cars run excellent and all the issues I was concerned with prior to entering the shop have all been addressed and fixed. Alan even offered to clean the fuel injectors on my Jaguar for no extra charge (which is about a $200+ job due to the supercharger). I refer all my friends to this shop and introduce them personally to the GM and he insures that everyone who walks in those doors are taken care of. Take my word for it, if your cars got an issue, and you got a budget, go down to this shop and ask for Alan, he'll take care of you.</review>

<text>A lot to say, so ill keep it short. Went in for an alignment and while in the office I overheard a conversation between the owner, Allen, and one of the employees Marcos regarding Mexican labor. I found the conversation offensive. In addition, they discussed a liability issue concerning a Porsche that they barely dodged, so I grew a mistrust towards the business. After-which the following happened:
- The diagnostics lacked readings before the alignment, and one of the wheels was not within the specified range.
- I asked for a discount, since the service was not complete
- Marcos insisted I take a full refund
- I leave a happy camper
- Next morning I get a call from Allen, the owner, who insinuates that I am a "con-man" even though his employee insisted I receive a full refund

I was terribly offended by the overall experience and I am amazed to see that this Midas location is still in business; however, only we as consumers can be blamed for allowing such businesses to remain operational. Please believe the comments posted about the owner, he is greedy and the only thing he is worried about is putting your money in his pocket. Hope this helps you make an informed purchase.

If you have experienced a similar situation please contact me, I would love to gather enough people to report this business to the Better Business Bureau.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< review>
The first time I came I was told that I owed $900, when it should have been $20. I didn't have time to deal with the issue then, and maybe couldn't have anyway if I'd tried, so that delayed a scan I needed almost 2 weeks.

The second visit was fine. The woman working on front was sleepy and not super friendly (understandable because it was 7:30am), but helpful enough. The rest of the staff was nice enough, given the early hour.

The results were read quickly. Thanks for that.< /review>

I had a mid day 1 pm appointment and arrived early to check in. The front desk staff were friendly, courteous and professional. It was a busy day apparently and appointments were backed up. I waited almost an hour to be called in for my procedure. It would have been good if I was updated on the wait time. No one kept me informed until I asked about 50 minutes into the wait and the response was “you should be up soon”. I just expect people who made appointments should be seen at the appointment time or shortly thereafter. If not, I should have been informed about the delay. The staff who handled my procedure was friendly and professional. It’s nice having the parking garage very close by. I will go back again. Chalking this up to an unusually busy day. Hopefully my next experience will be better.</text>

<Review>I went to the front desk to check in at 8:45 am but didn’t have to fill anything out since I already checked in online beforehand for my 9 am appointment. Wait until 9 am and someone called my name to do my CT scan with contrast for the lungs. The person who called me in (Randy) was performing my CT scan. Someone named Laz also assisted me and the scan took about 10 minutes or so. Completed and left in less than 30 minutes. The staff was fast, efficient, and polite. Simple and cheaper than other places. If you need a CT scan, I’d recommend this location.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I had tried to use another imaging place in San Francisco  2 days in a row. They only did walk-ins for x-rays. After being turned away day 1 and then told "4 hour wait" on day 2, I jumped online and found SimonMed. Confirmed they took my insurance, and popped in. I was in and out in 15 minutes! Super friendly, efficient, fast! Only a 10 min drive from my house, and free parking!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I’m only rating 3 stars because of this one visit. I have visited two other times (one pre- and one during COVID) where I had no issues. I believe that they were down one technician the day I went, so the check in line was extremely slow and out the door with only one person doing checkin. I had checked in online but wanted to be sure I was fully checked in — good thing because they asked for my ID even though I uploaded it to the site.

I waited in the hallway for 30 minutes before I got to check in and there were only 3 people ahead of me. Then I waited another 35 minutes to be seen. The staff is awesome. The mammogram tech was great. But the wait was terrible and I wish they explained why it was so long and how long my estimated wait would be because the longer I waited I started to think they forgot about me.

My appointment was Friday at 12:45 pm. I overheard the checkin staff tell someone it is worse between 2 and 5 pm. Good to know. I’d come here again for convenience but pick another day/time.</Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>The ultra sound technician was fabulous and very compassionate and helpful.

The front intake clerk was  inexperienced.  She demanded a credit card payment or refused me service even though though treatment is preapproved.  I called SimonMed billing and they confirmed that there was not an outstanding balance.  I will opt out and go to Lab Corp from now on.

<review>I had to get a contrast ct abdominal/pelvic scan. My insurance required precertification. One local hospital took far too many days to process it and then only got partial approval because they separated the precert as two procedures.

Another hospital would do the scan without precert but was charging me $2000 up front as out of network and I would be responsible for whatever the insurance wouldn't cover!!!

Total at Simon Med would be less than $1900 if my insurance doesn't pay. Simon has the best prices nearby. My only strike is that it would be better if they had a precertification department that customers could contact. They are in my ppo network so I'm hopeful that my insurance takes care of the bill.

I was able to get a Daly City appointment within two days of calling Simon Med. The online registration process and paperwork profile were a breeze and made for a very quick check in. Waiting room seating is limited due to covid social distancing. The staff is professional and the facility clean. I had to arrive an hour early to drink the contrast solution in my car. I returned at my appointment time and was called in within 5 minutes. Total time for the setup and scan was about 15 minutes then I was on my way home.

I'm very pleased with this experience and strongly recommend Simon Med!< /review>< Time>

Professional and kindness were noticed  right away, but then I had to wait after closing for an Uber that didn't cost 500$ and they waited with me without any qualm or even a bat of an eye.. then made sure I got into to the Uber safely because it was so late. I definitely recommend this imaging center.</Text>< pics>

<Text>The team at SimonMed were friendly and professional. The office was very busy the day I went but they processed everyone quickly and safely; cleaning between services and reminding us to stand/sit apart.

I've been to this location 4 times in the past 2 years and they are consistent.< /Text>< Date>

<Review>I realize we are all challenged with this pandemic and making everyone’s health a priority, but there were mixed messages upon arrival.  There were two signs at the door which could read “do not enter, you will be called!”  There is always a level of anxiety when having health tests done, so to be battling other patients over your place in line was a challenge.  As asked by your online and followed up by a text from your company, I  completed the on-line form, I was under the impression that all I would have to do is “check-in.”  I sent personal information that was requested on-line and there was no record of my information at the location.  The person at the desk said something I did not want to hear, as a matter of fact I asked him not to say it, “I don’t know where that information goes!”  I would be happy to hear from you that my personal information was not compromised.  All got better with the MRI technician, she was professional, knew her stuff, and was very accommodating.  She made what could have been an overall bad experience a better one.  I will say the original lady that helped me at the counter said she normally doesn’t work at the front desk.  I look forward to hearing from you that my information was not compromised.  I will chalk this up to the pandemic.<//Review>< Rate>

Appt was very organized. The personal was efficient, helpful and friendly. I had a very good experience and would recommend this facility.

Website was confusing to maneuver around. Not user friendly!  I had to call in get a real person to make an appt.<//Text>

I made an appointment at SimonMed imaging for bone density screening last month. I did all the requirements that they asked of me. My appointment was at 10am on March 4 at the Daly City location. At 8:30am I received a text to check in when I arrive at the facility so I went for my scheduled appointment. I checked in on my phone and I was instructed to proceed to the reception area. When I talked to the receptionist, he told me that they no longer do the bone density screening in the Daly City location and the closest one is in San Francisco. Why did they not notify ahead of time that there is no bone density screening done in this location instead of wasting my time and effort to make my appointment? This is not the only time my appointment was canceled. When I had an appointment for a mammogram last year, they forgot to tell me that the mammogram equipment was broken and that they had to cancel my appointment when I arrived at the facility. Simon Med Imaging/Health Diagnostics is the worst radiology provider I’ve ever used. I go there only because my insurance carrier has a contract with them. Otherwise I would rather go somewhere else.< /Text>

This place is a JOKE BESIDES THE FACT THAT I WAITED OVER AN HOUR AND HALF & still asked why they haven’t called me. LIED to me and saying my schedule appointment was at
Another time when I made the appointment & they called me the day before to confirm. DO NOT GO HERE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.< /review>

Terrible experience here. They let me wait in their waiting room for 40 minutes, then told me they don’t do the kind of imaging I was sent there for (ultrasound). I recommend you avoid this place.< /text>

I will never get a scan from here again. I’d first get robocalls from SimonMed saying I can walk in for X-rays every day or so for 2 weeks. I show up to the San Rafael location only to have the receptionist be incredibly rude and unhelpful. She goes to say that they don’t do walk-ins or X-rays, which is false. She didn’t try to assist, just was vile to me despite being in the wrong. There goes 1 hour of my time wasted with poor treatment.

Then, I spend 20 minutes filling out their forms online to schedule an appointment. A couple days before my scheduled appointment, I received a call from someone actually competent telling me that their San Rafael office doesn’t have strong enough magnets to get a good picture for my scan. Just wow. I ask where I can get this done and she said it would be one of the other locations. I had her find out which one so my time wouldn’t be completely wasted again, as this is not listed anywhere online and their scheduling system isn’t sophisticated enough to know which office can service which type of scan. She called me right back and confirmed that only the Daly City location can do the MRE, since it’s a complicated scan. She got that scheduled for me. Yet another hour wasted.

Meanwhile, my GI appointments have now been delayed - delaying my CARE and treatment - for weeks due to all of these issues.

Finally we get to the day of the scan. I was told to arrive an hour before to drink the prep liquid. They just had me sit there for 45 minutes. What’s even the point of arriving early? I finally get called in for the scan, 1 hour past the original appointment time at 9:15. As I’m getting the hospital gown to change into, I’m asked if I have any metal in my body. As I’d filled out in the copious forms beforehand, I have a belly button piercing. I was told I’d have to take it out. Why am I finding this out right before?! Then I struggle to take out my piercing, which I haven’t taken out in 8+ years. After weeks of waiting, I didn’t want to not be able to go through with this due to my piercing. One of the x-ray technicians gave me some pliers and that did the trick. Absolutely wild. All in all, I spent 3 hours total there.

After the hours of my time wasted, delays and rude treatment, I’d recommend never using SimonMed if you can help it.< /review>

Your Daly City office had to cancel my appointment. However, afterwards I kept getting reminders of my appointment. I left messages that it had been cancelled. And now you want a review of my experience.  Please let me know when I can reschedule my appointment.< /review>

< Review>
This place has problem with their schedulers. I called the scheduling phone number on my doctor’s authorization for bone density scan. The scheduler scheduled me an 8 am appointment at 1180 post st. I did the pre check-in online the day before, but when I got there, they said they do not do Bone density scan in Northern California, then they should not check for Nue Med on the back of the authorization form. So I called the scheduling again to schedule a  DEXA appoint at 455 Hickey blvd, I got an appt for Monday at 4 pm. When I got there for my appt, they said they do not do DEXA on Monday and reschedule me for Wednesday at 9:30 am. I finally got DEXA done on Wednesday after going their facilities for 3 times. This is the worst company I have experienced. They must improve their communications between their facilities and their Schedulers.</Review>

<review>I was given an appointment for 8pm on 7/21/20 with an arrival time of 7:30pm. However, I was not told that the Daly City building was locked at 6pm and another entrance was available. I arrived on time and stood outside wondering if i was in the wrong place. After calling in, I was directed to the after hour entrance. My treatment inside was welcoming, calming and reassuring. Omar and Mei were professional, efficient and made me comfortable for my MRI. Thank you for this opportunity to express my experience. Be well and stay safe. GOD bless.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I've been trying for three weeks to get an appointment. I scheduled one online but their system sent me to a location that doesn't do the procedure I need, which I found out only when I arrived for my appointment. I wasted PTO because of that. I've called their number more than ten times and always get a message saying my call cannot be processed due to a system error. I tried their online chat and was cut off three times. I don't know how SimonMed stays in business with customer service like this.< /review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>My experience with SimonMed was very positive. Appointment went as scheduled.
One thing I would ask that they improve on is their answering service. It took numerous calls to schedule an appointment as they seemed to have many issues not being able to have someone answer the phone and I needed to keep calling with the same message to call back.
Another problem is that they’ll say to call back during business hours but they don’t let you know what they are.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Could not reach them by phone.  They cancelled my appointment because their machine was broken.  Could not reach them to reschedule my MRI.  I had used this facility and SimonMed in the past, but they are now worse than terrible.  One of the worst service experiences ever.  And I never even got to the facility--who knows what that would have been like?<//Review>

SimonMed Imaging canceled my appointment 3 separate times. First time they called the day before to notify me.  The second cancellation, I received a text the morning of. And this last cancellation I was again notified by text the morning of. All 3 times due to "the tech is unavailable for your exam with us today." Terrible management.</text>

<text>I’ve been coming here for my mammograms. The staff is very attentive. Registration is quick and although the waiting room was mostly full, there were chairs outside in the hallway where it was empty. Annette was the one who helped me and she was very nice and professional, and she made me feel comfortable during the mammogram.</text>< pictures>

This place is the pits. It's dirty with stained carpeting and hair stuck on chair seats from other patient's. My biggest frustration was that they never sent me my MRI report or followed up, after I faxed the release form 4 times, wrote the doctor whom to release the records to on my intake forms, and called at least 15-20 times, leaving messages with each call. Beyond ridiculous! And, better yet, when I finally recieved the report, it was written up for the WRONG FOOT. Did the radiologist even look at my MRI when she wrote up the report. Guess what, still haven't received my correct MRI report, after numerous requests. This place SUCKS!<//Text>

< Review>
Called to reschedule due to illness, kept getting ‘system down’ . Tried 12 times since the Friday before appt. Also never received a reminder at which time I would have been able to speak to someone.
Every appt has some sort of issue.
Very disappointing.<//Review>

There was a lot of confusion with the scheduling as I did the online request, and again on the phone (after not getting a response 3 days later). But once it was sorted out, it was all fine. The actual appointment itself went smoothly and I was in and out within 40 mins.< /text>

Really nice staff super friendly. I would of gave them 5 stars but locks on locker are not cleaned so you are carrying a dirty key change that the person before you used. The changing area is sharred . I do not see it being wiped down. Bring your wipes to wipe down bench to sit if you need to sit while dressing and undressing. Many people waiting over 8 but it was as spaced out as you can be for a small office. The gentleman at the front desk was so kind he let me wait in my car until it was my turn. I have to pre exsisting conditions and also care for my parents. So I need to be mindful of where I go.</text>

<username>Jessica Shih</username><Text>This review is in comparison to my PCP and OB Gyn office visits during the pandemic. I don’t think SimonMed does a good job of ensuring the safety of patients. There was no one to greet patients to ensure they were all wearing masks and sanitizing their hands before entering the facilities. You have to ask for sanitizer that’s kept behind the front desk with the reps as it wasn’t available to use. You can tell they overbooked appointments as there were 6 patients in the waiting room and another 6 or so waiting in the hallway right outside the elevators. I had to wait almost 20 minutes past my scheduled appointment. The equipment was new and the exam rooms are fine—hence the 2 stars. The waiting area feels dirty and unsanitary, which is a concern as we’re in a surge for the pandemic. I wouldn’t be surprised if this office is a source of spreading the disease. I hope the health department asks them to take corrective actions to properly space out appointments and staff adequately to manage the entrance and all ask patients to sanitize their hands before entry, which is the procedure at other medical offices. This place treats patients like a factory to jam out the most amount of tests and profits.<//Text>< resp>

<review>Well, the technician was nice but several things happened that raised my concern. Even though there were two rooms for patients to wait, and masks were required, the rooms were packed! And several people were very sick! There was a lot of coughing! I couldn't get far enough away. You should not have let that happen. Secondly, I came in for a neck catscan. The technician first thought he was doing my hip. Then he thought it was a chest catscan. Luckily I had the paperwork from the doctor with me. What's up with that?</review>< pics>

First, I want to offer a five star review for the technician and the actual imaging process that I experienced. The technician was very professional and was courteous and helping me get set up to do the scan for an MRI.
I want to leave one star for the fact that I saw a different technician walking around the reception area frequently and also in the area where the scans are done without a mask. Rather, she had a mask below her nose and often also not covering her mouth. This is unacceptable in a healthcare setting In this time of increasing Covid infections in the bay area. It made me very uncomfortable and I was glad to have my mask on. If she ended up being the technician that was going to work with me I would have raised this as an issue and spoken to the supervisor.
The waiting area was very dirty the walls were marked up from chairs being pushed up against it and the carpeting had multiple dark stains that appeared to have been there for a very long time. The waiting area was a one star experience.< /text>

I posted in all right review the first time I went. There was some small issues but overlooked them.this time I went in lady checked me and made me wait five minutes while she was busy typing, then after a half an hour I was told to drink a liquid they didn't tell me that I'd have to wait for another hour before they'd call me in. When I finally called in I needed a pillow they didn't have one they gave me a bunch of gowns to put my arm on. When they put the IV in me it clogged they tried to flush it and it still didn't seem right but they continued. Procedure was over they took the IV out put a Band-Aid on. I got up and within 30 seconds blood was gushing all over the place the whole floor look like someone had been massacred in less than a minute. I stood by the door and called for help three times before someone came,then the gentleman that acknowledged me his only concern was are you saying it's our fault?I mean I was light-headed and dizzy at least they could have offered me some orange juice or something they just left me there.and if ever anyone's had a vein that bleeds there was literally looks like somebody got killed in that room in less than a minute. I would never have any imaging done there where they have to insert an IV. Please go somewhere else<//Text>

<Date>1621278605704<//Date><rate>2< /rate><review>Twice got turned away by SF Post Street location due to ultrasound machine malfunction, I decided to try out Daly City. Parking was easy, waiting area was clean, check-in was pretty straight forward. Was told to check in 15 minutes early at 7:45AM and I didn't have to wait long and got called in at 8AM. Tech was friendly and professional. The whole process took 30 minutes. Will definitely go back for imaging needs.

Update: Decided to return for CT and mammogram. Rep on the phone was very nice and set up both appointments on the same day 5/10/21, and also arranged it close together to save me time and hassle. After all, the CT needs 4-hour fasting prior.

4 days before 5/10, I got a text instructing me to reschedule mammogram. When I called back, no answer. Since mammogram appt is easier to manage, I was fine with it. After fasting early morning at 8:30am, 3 hours before the CT, they texted me claiming no technician would be there to administer contrast. I called SimonMed to confirm the cancellation and reschedule. After a long long wait I got someone on the phone. She read the same note about the cancellation, put me on hold and not long I was disconnected. I called back and finally someone answered. He was nice and rescheduled me, but not on a Thursday which is my day off. The rescheduled appt is a backup plan. SimonMed failed me a few times. My day off was wasted. As soon as I called my clinic they reached out to UCSF for me and all documents and appointments set up within a week.

SimonMed's quality of service is good, ONLY if you actually attend the appointment and the equipment is in working order. To play safe, I'm sticking with UCSF.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Once you go through the insurance process everything goes smoothly. I was able to schedule a MRI  within 3 days. When I arrived on a Saturday I was greeted by Cindy at the front and had to fill out some paperwork.

Usually i am impressed. I have been here for several visits before. This time i was kept waiting over 15 minutes without any excuse or apology. I was on time and even early. 3 or 4 people were admitted before me. Dissappointed.< /review>

<Text>I was very pleased with my visit, during these trying times with the COVID-19 I approached the reception desk, the staff greeted me, handed me paperwork to fill out, had clean & used pens on the desk along with hand sanitizer. The gentleman told me they are running a little late, he said he would call me on my cell and I could wait outside if I wanted. I was pleased with his concern because sitting to long is a problem for me.  The waiting room had one other person,  clean and proper spacing. The tech  came out shortly afterwards. she was kind, courteous and was concerned about the pain I was experiencing in my neck before, during and after the MRI. Thank you simon imaging , job well done<//Text><gmapID>0x808f7beaee96baed:0xea18e6e705e209d4<//gmapID><resp>{'time': 1595540483310, 'text': 'Thank you for the review!'}< /resp>< Rating>

<text>They have evening & weekend hours and they got me an appointment quickly when they finally got the authorization after I  called them. I attempted to make an appointment on the phone & they said I had to have the authorization faxed over to the location I was going to get my MRI done at. I had my drs office fax it over, only to find out that it takes at least 3 hours for the authorization to show up in the system. I made an appointment for that evening, thinking the authorization would surely be in the system & the prompt said they would call me back but they never did. So basically I had to be very assertive to get my appointment. The MRI equipment seemed to be very old. I have had an MRI at county a few years ago & their machine was very high tech. I didn’t feel as claustrophobic as in the machine at this place. The tech was nice enough but the gown was ill-fitting and I had a difficult time getting it on. The nice thing is they have a dressing room with lockers and a key. You can bring key into exam room with you. Also, when the tech positioned me, she didn’t tell me I could lay my arm down flat & so I was uncomfortable for the procedure. It’s the little details that make for a good vs not-so good experience. Overall I didn’t like the experience but who likes getting an MRI?  I would go somewhere else next time where they have a newer machine that’s larger so as not to feel so claustrophobic. Another off-putting point is that the bathroom smelled like urine. It looked clean but when a health care facility bathroom smells, it makes a person feel like perhaps the whole facility is unsanitary.</text><userid>106135404619559174528</userid>< rate>

<Review>Been sitting in the lobby for over an hour and a half from when I was told to arrive. Patients have priorities in their life and wasting peoples time because you can’t schedule properly is a poor and disrespectful way to treat clients.
This is after they never called to schedule my appointment after a week of having my referral despite saying it was the protocol to call three times.
Will not return.
2 hours now. Still have not gotten my mri. Terrible.<//Review>< Pics>

The reception staff, though, was a mixed bag. Cynthia was very professional and courteous when she reconfirmed my appointment the day before  and also when I came to pick up my images and report. However, on the morning of my procedure, the reception desk was somewhat unprofessional. In the process of checking me in, they offered me little  acknowledgment,  no instruction  about the paperwork I needed to complete ( they just handed me the paperwork on a clipboard), virtually no eye contact, and they were busy talking amongst themselves about personal matters. For a medical establishment, this is not  acceptable.< /review><Response>{'time': 1547853388888, 'text': 'Hello, Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

<Review>I was impressed by the professional treatment I received here from the front desk to the techs who did my tests. The mammogram machine is brand new, state-of-the-art at the Daly City location where I was. The radiologist was very thorough. I felt confident that my results were accurate. It was a real plus that I was told the results before I left. No more waiting and worrying.< /Review><user_id>102464715294385964454< /user_id>< time>

My shoulder hurt because of the angle that i was laying at. Guy gave me water and checked in. Professional layout in the office space as well as the changing rooms with lockers and whatnot.
Careful with getting to the office. I was locked in the stairwell for a good 10 minutes before I could get to floor 2. The furthest East stairwell is a trap so be weary. Take the main East lobby or the west lobby to make it there on time.
Overall pretty okay experience. Just something that had to be done. L wrist and R thumb MRI.< /text>

<text>Scheduling  an appoinment was easy and the scheduler was very courteous.

On the day of the appointment, registration was smooth. There’s a bit of a waiting time to be called in for the procedure, but the wait was pleasant.

There was also a little delay to get the procedure started, but the technician kept us appraised of reason for the delay and how much wait is anticipated.

Communication is important to us and the staff did a great job of this!

I will definitely recommend this office if I knew of someone needing an MRI procedure.

Thank you for the excellent service.</text><name>Connie Yabes-Sabolboro<//name>< pics>

<review>Friendly, efficient and professional service.  I had an MRI on my knee, and only my lower half needed to enter the tube.  I was comfortable and able to relax.  Office staff @ Hickey Blvd in SSF fabulous.  I would like to see SimonMed nationwide remove their single use plastic cups from their drinking fountains and switch to a compostable alternative.

<Review>I got there early and they were very nice  about it. I didn't have to wait too long and I had my bone scsn. The technician, Anette , was very good and efficient. I was all done before 10:30am (my appointment was at 10:00am). I was back home a little after 11:00am.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful experience from start to finish. Very friendly and professional staff. Really appreciated the staff prompt assistance with rescheduling my MRI appointment and expediting the report submission to my physician, as well as the post MRI follow up. Eugene and Abigail are simply amazing.</text>

Very nice staff.  Appointment was on time; excellent imaging tech--very professional, performed mammogram and bone density exam, with no delays.  Everyone in the Daly City lab seemed to know what they were doing--a pleasant experience!

< Review>
The girls at the desk were so friendly and helpful. They quickly helped me with the paperwork. I completed it and was called in early by the technician 👩‍🔧 She was very nice and made me feel very comfortable. She was so good it only took 15 minutes when They told me it would take 30! I will go back for all my imaging in the future. Wonderful customer service.<//Review>

<review>Simon Imaging has always been a POSITIVE experience. The staff there are amazing. They are calm, pleasant and they are sensitive to the fact that people come there nervous about the procedures they are about to do. I definitely would recommend them for any kind of imaging purposes.  I have had both MRIs and heart scans done there.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I had my mammogram at Simon Med Imaging.  It’s a very clean and friendly environment.  My technician was very professional and quick at what she does.  I was pretty much in and out in less than 15 minutes.  I believe the morning hours are the best time to get things done.</text>

< Review>
As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice young lady at the front desk. The technician who did my MRI was nice as well however I wasn’t happy with the long wait. As soon as I got there which I arrived 1 hour before my appt to do paperwork I was told they were running 1-1.5 hour late. A call prior would have been nice so I didn’t have to kill 1 hour of my time. I just couldn’t see how they were running late when they just opened? Overall, the people I interacted with were pleasant I have no complaints about that. The wait time was however frustrating.<//Review>

I called to schedule a CT scan on 06/22/2020, as referred by Hill Physicians. The receptionist had a condescending tone and I told her she had a rude attitude, and that I was not interested in using their office as a result. Poor customer service.< /review>

Staff are very friendly. There are long wait times during peak hours during the day which is understandable. The changing rooms could do with a little more privacy or clearer indictation if in use. Otherwise good location with parking<//Review>

The check in progress was timely.  I was taken on time and the MRI technician was so nice and helpful.  He got me extra pillows and a blanket.  When done he helped me up and handed me my glasses.  The only negative was the building they are in has a confusing parking garage and I was not sure which floor to park on or which door to use.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Shady billing practice. They asked for my insurance card and then said “there’s a deductible.” I asked “is it not covered by insurance?” And then they said “yes it is but you haven’t paid your deductible for the year yet.” Now it turns out they were out of network for my insurance. But they never mentioned it. If they had, I would have gone somewhere else. Service is fine but either double check that they’re in network with your insurance or avoid this place! Shady.</review>< Pics>

The appointment desk person was not kind  and professional . They schedule the time and can not keep appointment time . Reschedule our appointment 2 time and they lost the paper we submit at the time of appointment. Wasting our time and refill the form for the appointment. Not considering of patient’s time and mind. Very unhappy experience at this SimonMed imaging center! Need improvement at front desk personal attitude and professionally handle with people come to this center!!!<//review>

No instructions for evening scheduled patients how to get in to your office, I and other patient had to look for the entrance for more than 10 minutes. Finally, we tried out the low level of the garage, and found out a small door can be opened. I hope you can improve this mistake in the future!<//Review>

I went to my appointment on time at the Los Gatos location and at no point anytime there did they tell me that that was impossible. I was halfway through my appointment when their machine broke. How does an MRI facility not have a working MRI? I will say they did quickly get me another appointment the next morning for their Daly City location and told me they would absolutely complete my MRI's and my doctor would have them in a timely manner. I get to my appointment in Daly City right on time where they told me that the technician refused to do the MRI because the images would not line up. At no point prior to this moment was that ever an issue. They spent about thirty minutes going back and forth with the technician while I called my doctor to complain to them as to why they even sent me to Simonmed when they are clearly incapable of doing my MRI. The doctor said we could just do the pelvic with and without contrast just to get my MRI done in time for my surgery. Furhermore, they charged me for the visit in Daly City when they said nothing about charging me in advance in the Los Gatos location even though I have a PPO and they are in network. All in all, a terrible experience at Simonmed. No communication to me in advance about what was even possible to do in one appointment and I had to go to two different locations just to have a working MRI machine. Will never return to Simonmed and I hope others don't waste their time going to Simonmed.</text><user_id>102933282848149011373</user_id><pictures>None</pictures><rate>1</rate></record>

They took the time to confirm with my insurance carrier that an MRI scan was covered 100% after saying I owed approximately $750. Front desk staff was friendly. Technicians were also welcoming. Waiting room and facilities were clean. Location had plenty of parking.</Text>

<Review>The staff was super friendly and helpful. Wait time longer than I expected, but the waiting lounge was comfortable and they had Coco (the movie) playing which was great!
Overall, I feel it was a great experience and they made me feel comfortable.
Thank you and have a great weekend!

< Review>
I had a great experience at Simon Imaging. I had an emergency situation and was told by my Dr. to get an ultrasound immediately. It being late in the day I called Simon Imaging for the soonest appt. I could get. They got me in the next morning. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The wait was probably 20 min but to be expected as it was packed with patients. All for different services. So don’t be discouraged if you have an appt. your handled first as they do take walk ins for X-rays. I had a wonderful experience. My tech was very sweet and attentive as well as informative. I would def come back if needed. Pleasant experience all the way around.< /Review>

I arrived about 2:30 on 1/21/18. The office was full of people. One of the
looked at me and asked if I had an appointment. She was very kind and helpful in finding out if my insurance would cover the cat scan. She called my name and said they would cover most of it and told me what my co-pay was. She was very gracious. In a few minutes I had my cat scan.</Review>

<review>No instructions for evening scheduled patients how to get in to your office, I and other patient had to look for the entrance for more than 10 minutes. Finally, we tried out the low level of the garage, and found out a small door can be opened. I hope you can improve this mistake in the future!< /review>< Date>

The receptionist was soo nice and friendly. She even tried to accomodate me to get an earlier scan as I  came quite early.
The person who did the scan was also very friendly and did  everything very professionally and fast. He said only 6 min. I am sorry I don't know his name but I want to say THANK YOU for the excellent service.</Review>

Waited almost 2 hours for a 5 minute procedure. Not cool because I was extremely late for work but really needed to get my X-ray done. Should be allowed to set an appointment up instead of a walk-in basis. Not efficient at all.<//text>

At about 7:15 two employees hurried through the lobby, coming to work. At about 7:30 the person doing my scan came out and said he had to run the machine to perform QC.

<review>Worst service ever. Couldn’t get my order right when scheduled. Showed up and telling I need to make another appointment for my foot. After I talked to the girl on the phone and told her I have the order the Dr gave me and what boxes I check off. Also I am a large person and told them so. I need either and open mri or a large mri machine. They scheduled me to a office that has neither. Asked me to make another appointment. Yes I will make another appointment with a different imaging place.< /review><gmap_id>0x808f7beaee96baed:0xea18e6e705e209d4</gmap_id>< time>

When I arrived no one had contacted my insurance company to get pre approval for the additional MRI & I had to return on Monday & fortunately I phoned before I left my house as my insurance still has not be contacted for approval.

Went to the office on 10/15 . Ask for my ID and health card but scanner not working and was told by the receptionist to filled up the form and she’ll give me back my stuff after. I saw her left maybe for lunch or break. Technician called me inside but never got my ID and health card back. After done I totally forgot about it but ask the counter different receptionist  if I need to do something else. Before I get a response they were just talking .Was told I’m done. Week passed by no call from the office. Just found out last 10/22 that I did not get my ID and health card back. When I call back they said they don’t have them. Big hassle to me and receptionist need some  training in customer service. Hopefully some actions will be done on this matter</text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>The scheduling and front desk was fine, however the experience in the MRI was terrible. There was no effort made to make sure I was comfortable... room was very cold and I had to ask for blankets.. told the heater was “broken. “ and the entire scan took 15 minutes!! Have had several knee MRIs in the past but never one that finished so quickly. The tech was abrupt, just wanted to get the scan done. Will never go back ! Hope I don’t have to repeat due to poor quality.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Was a good experience overall, however there could have been more information on what was to happen.  As I needed to have an injection in my knee to make the CT scan work I didn’t appreciate that it would make driving and walking really difficult for the remainder of the day.  Some more info on what was going to happen and the impact would have been good.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Only had to go here once but I'll never visit again as long as I have another option.

I called them for an appointment after my doctor verified that they are in-network for our insurance. I got an appointment for Date X. I called them to confirm the costs but the person on the phone told me the insurance doesn't cover the test and it's going to be $X. I was confused and asked them to cancel the appointment. I called my insurance and they confirmed that the test is covered 100%. I called these guys back. First, they told me the appointment for date X hadn't been cancelled :/. and they also said it's not covered. They asked me to hold and talk to finance people. I waited for like 15 mins to talk to them. They agreed it's covered 100% and forwarded back to the appointment people. I changed my appointment to date Y when I was told to come at 3.45pm and drink lots of water 1 hour before coming to keep the bladder full.

We arrived with plenty of time to spare. The reception lady informed the appointment is actually for 4pm - why didn't anyone tell me over the phone about this? Usually you'd here "this is the appt time but please come 15 mins early", specially when they're asking me to hold my bladder full. Then they asked for ID which I didn't have on me - they wouldn't allow the test without it. They never asked me to bring the ID!? Fine, I said and drove back home and got my ID still arriving before 4pm. Now they told me the appointment was changed to 4.15pm!? Having drank lots of water my bladder was about to burst.. Fine, I said, as I was handed the forms to fill out - which they could have easily handed me when I arrived the first time!? Fine, I said filled up the form. After waiting till 4.10, I asked about how long it's gonna be - this is the first time my form was actually sent inside to the lab folks! The lab person then came out and said I didn't even need to hold my bladder since the test doesn't require it!?

What the hell guys, get your act together!< /Review>< pictures>

The nurse called me 10 minutes before the appointment about the camera problem
when I am literally in the building. The camera was down the whole day, but only called me 10 minutes before the appointment. The service in the front desk is not wonderful either. The guy had to help the new staff and let me wait when he was helping the new staff. That’s not professional :-(< /text>

Had to share a dressing room with members of the opposite sex. It’s uncomfortable enough to be undressed wearing a flimsy gown.
Cold room in the imaging room.
Image person was not very personable or informative. Seems like that part is rushed to make money.</review>

However as my name was called the male tech called me for my turn he announced to the room “beverly... there’s a problem” TO THE WHOLE ROOM!!!  He could have just called my name and spoke to me privately about the “PROBLEM”.  I felt very rushed about resolving this “problem” and felt all protocol was thrown out.  They rushed me in without verifying my ID and insurance info before getting the MRI. I had to call my other  doctor to resolve the “problem” NOT A WELCOMING EXPERIENCE BEFORE ENTERING THE MRI MACHINE.

MRI Tech was great and had great bedside manners. So I’ll give them 3 stars thanks to him.

Simon Med in Daly City - has a third name on my third visit. I was told to come 30 minuets before my appointment time to fill out the paperwork. The paperwork turned out to be 2 sheets of paper, which I filled out in 5 minutes. Then I waited a full hour to get an MRI. I could have been called with an update, but no. I hate when medical offices waste patients time so easily.
The staff is friendly and polite, but the wait time was way too long. Next time I’m going to come on time to cut my wait time.</text>

Went there 3 times and on the third time everything worked. No big deal. I’m retired.
The lady’s at the front desk were great, very apologetic. Went back the third time and had the MRI, got a copy and went home.
I would go back there anytime I needed them.<//review>

Tried multiple sites last week to get a xray. Which you can not schedule. Mountain  view had no xray tech, call out. I called, central scheduling, no way to contact the site directly, on the way to Redwood City said tech was there. Got to Redwood City no tech on that day. Attempted to go to Los Gatos, no opening  for xray and you can't schedule anything. Finally the next week made it to Daily City office. Very friendly, quick xray but did not get correct xray needed by my doctor. Concerning for an Imagining company.<//review>

<review>Pushed my appt back an hour bc their MRI tech didn’t show up and they had no backup. Never bothered to mention that the price of service had doubled from last year’s promo pricing. CHECK THE PRICE before you come here. Many other places around are cheaper and better, or not worse.

The receptionist called to see if I was still coming. As my luck would have it,  I was running behind because I had been lost for 15 minutes on foot and my phone was dying.  She explained how to find the location and opened the door:  she thought she was going to have to come find me. Just the thought was awesome! I told her i needed a bathroom and she allowed me to do that before check in.  I told her about my dying phone and she charged it for me. When my appointment was over,  because I told her I came from Oakland on public transportation, she had summoned a taxi to get bew back to bart! I LOVE THIS PLACE</text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>When I called to make an appt, the scheduler was distracted and unfriendly. No one told me that I would need to remove my wedding rings or watch for my MRI, but I figured it was my knee, so...  Nope. Had to wrench off my never-removed rings and watch and lock these valuables in a gym locker in an open changing room. Would’ve been so easy to remove them at home and safer to leave them there!! Plus the street address is a large building with another business name displayed & only a small side sign that states SimonMed Imaging. Had to do a U-turn twice til I found it, then parked and walked to the lobby to see a paper sign taped to the door that said ‘Sorry for the inconvenience, please park on the lower level to access SimonMed’. How hard would it be to tell patients to park and enter on the lower level when they schedule? Finally the receptionist was on her phone, didn’t greet me or look at me and just handed me a clipboard. Cheaper than getting my MRI at Sutter health, but a crummy experience. The Walmart of MRIs.< /review>< Pictures>

This is by far the worst medical facility I've ever been to. After I registered, the receptionist forgot I was there so I went and asked after waiting for over an hour when I would be going in and she said she didn't even know I was there. Then when I went to get my x-ray, the technician forgot to give me the protective apron. I had to remind him. The last time I went there, they had a substitute x-ray tech who didn't know how to use their system or even have the most basic computer skills. He was trying to delete something and didn't know the keyboard had a delete key. I swear, this is what he actually said to me: "How do I make the words disappear?" Do not go to this place. If someone offers you an x-ray or MRI that's a two-hour drive away, or go to this awful place, take the two-hour drive.< /Text>

I was surprised, when I arrived at Simonmed, that I had to walk down into a parking garage to find the entrance. There could be a better, safer after-hours experience.< /Text>

Staffed messed up our appointment time and instead of apologizing, decided to lie and say “it’s b/c of the type of exam, she needed to be here early”... an hr and a half early? I don’t think so.<//Text>

<text>Worst experience with a medical provider. My appointment was at 3 pm, but they did not tell me that was the early arrival time for paperwork- my scan time was actually 330. Of course I arrived early for paper work so I got there at 230. I waited until 4 before I checked back at reception and they told me they were running late but it would only be 15 more minutes. I then came back to check at 415 and they said any minute. They finally came to get me at 445, a full 2 hours after I arrived. I also watched an old, infirm woman wait for an hour before being told that the x ray tech had actually left, and that they just forgot to tell her.</text>< Pics>

I’ve had MRIs done at the Daly City  and it’s always been a good experience. I especially appreciate Abby who helped me to arrange appointments when I was looking for a different time.  Yolie at the front desk was great (sorry I might have name spelled wrong ) also the technicians have been great and gracious and considerate while doing my MRIs; sorry I forgot their names.  Overall a good experience.<//Text>

This office needs a lot of help. Customer service and friendless was not there. Hours waiting., You can feel the frustration of the patients waiting.. It was like your employees didn't like there work. What a shame ,!< /Review>

Very good experience, highly recommend!!

- before I went, I checked the reviews and find out the main problem is deal with payment. So I well prepared before I went. I called on last Wed and got an appointment Friday(yesterday). I received my approval letter from my insurance company and brought it with me. Receptionist don't need it and just asked for my ID and ins card.
- Receptionist are very nice and helpful :
The receptionist(forgot to ask her name) was nice and explained to me when I had questions from the forms, when I finished the first page, she took it and process first so I was called not even I finished completing all forms.
I want to get a copy of my MRI and I forgot to mention yesterday when I left so I went back this morning and I was lucky that they are open. Although their office shows closed on Saturday but they open for patients with appointment. Receptionist Cindy was very nice to burn the CD right away for me.
- Technican Mike was very nice and gentle. He    answered any questions that I asked. Now I know the difference between a normal MRI and an open MRI. If people don't feel comfortable to get into a closed MRI, they can choose the open one but it will be at least double the time. My coworker told me that  his whole MRI appointment took nearly 1-1/2 to 2hrs but it only took me 40mins. 1.5T might be 10-15 mins longer than 3T machine depend on what part of the body so 3T is the fastest, heehee...
- very convenience to change to another location. This company is a group, I make a simple call and changed my appointment from San Francisco to Daly City and I don't need to give my insurance info again.
- feel comfortable, although they don't have music to listen but with double ear plugs, put into my ears and add a headset ear plug outside, it cuts down a lot of noise. Of course you can still hear it, but I just treated it as different types of music rymthum. With the blanklet totally cover me, it makes me feel very comfortable and relax, so time go fast.
- very easy parking, they are located at the same building of AAA with a huge free parking lot.

Thanks SimonMed Imaging/Daly City!<//Text>

If there was 0 instead of 1 for the rating, I would have no doubt to put 0. My appointment was scheduled at 9:30am. I arrived at 9am to register. It took them 1 hour 40 minuets to process the registration which is totally unacceptable. The exam was delayed by more than an hour due to their unprofessionalism. As consequence, I missed my scheduled meeting.< /text>

One of your front office girls was rude one of your Imaging people literally taped my legs together and I am experiencing severe pain today my legs went numb and I made it very clear to them that I had a very bad back and they did whatever it was they pleased and now I'm suffering today from the pain you need to speak to your employees and tell them to listen when someone tells them that they have a bad back they need to make sure that they accommodate them properly very bad experience at your place</review>
