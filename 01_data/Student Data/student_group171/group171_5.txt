<text>Terrible Bart stop. If you can avoid using this station, I highly recommend it. Escalators have been broken for a few days with no sign of progress. Especially on high volume times when a lot of workers commute to and from work, it adds a huge delay. Only 1 escalator going up, and people have to queue to go down the stairs to the platform. Bart is not a good transportation system, and can definitely benefit from learning from other transportation systems in the world. Unfortunately, commuters are forced to take it and just accept the fact that it’s terrible - constantly increasing prices but reflect very little improvements and very little concern for the passengers.<//text><rating>1<//rating>< resp>

<userid>108775260680068855251< /userid><text>Dark as a dungeon as 90% of the fluorescent tubes are burned out. They've not been in replaced in 3 years. Applicable at muni and BART levels.

Neglect or abandonment of what should be routine maintenance created a safety problem.  The cost of replacing all the bulbs on both platforms would be a fraction of the overtime expense paid to the Powell Station janitor last year.

LED tubes are now available and are compatible with existing fixtures. LED bulbs use half the electricity of a fluorescent tube and last five times longer. The cost differential is small and the payback is short.  Maybe the Montgomery station is not the only thing being kept in the dark.

Don't let perfect get in the way of good.

Yeah, replacing bulbs is not sexy, glamorous, or career-making. But it does show some respect for the passenger and voter. It seems like the least you could do to keep us safe and out of our cars< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x8085806285ddb1a3:0xad9ca7333b4399a7</gmapID><rating>1</rating><Time>1492559106475< /Time>< Name>

Escalator always seems to be broken. The homeless people surround the entry to this area most of the time. It seems dark and rather shabby. There are no bathrooms down here. Be careful to actually go to the BART entrance, and not the MUNI entrance. They are different. There are several recharging stations here.< /Review>

<text>BART is an example of a good idea that it carried out as poorly as can be humanly achieved. Claiming to not have enough money to fix specific infrastructure problems, BART has decided to remove seating in order to stuff more people onto already overcrowded trains. More riders equal more money. BART has also decided to raise ticket prices--more so for paper ticket purchasers, preying upon those unable to create Clipper accounts for whatever reasons--and to charge for parking, a service numerous riders need to even use BART in the first place. All to raise required funding. This raises the question of why BART doesn't have the funding they need. There are several reasons, but the most laughable is BART's complaint about fare jumpers. Setting aside the question of if BART earns fares with their poor service, the company has no right to complain when they neglect to make sure gates are observed. I have never been to the PIT/Baypoint station without seeing at least one fare jump. Nobody in the booth, nobody watching the gates. BART relies on our necessity of them. That won't change very quickly, but it can change eventually. If you're reading this and contemplating finding a ride or ride share instead of BART, do it. Do it once to try it and see how you like it. Let's make BART work for us instead of treating us like cash cows and herding us like cattle.< /text><Time>1525492324216< /Time><username>Russell Roe<//username></record></dataset><record>

I’m an unhappy customer because this branches manager was rude and inconsiderate to me.  My wallet had been recently stolen and my identification along with my cards was confiscated. I express my concerns and wish to close or restrict the account but instead the manager refused to help me because I didn’t have a photo ID. I had brought other documents like birth certificate, W-2 and even a bank statement. The manager was still unwilling to help and just told me to call customer service. I called customer service and was told that I need to go to a branch location to close the account; But the branch won’t see me because I have no photo ID because it was also stolen. I have been waiting to get my new ID in the mail and I have no control over my account.<//review>

Love the secret entrance to this on Montgomery, right before the Starbucks. This entrance closes after around 7 pm on weekdays though, and isn't open on weekends.

Not too busy in this station, even during rush hour.

Usually a busker or two by the escalators, and of course the Scientologist tables..< /review>

<text>This is definitely 101% absolutely the bestest Bart station in San Francisco. It’s in the most convenient place and is very clean. Much cleaner and better than all other bart stations. I go out of my way every day to go here instead of the bart station closer to me. Sometimes I’ll just hang out because it’s so great. Often people will just put money in the box in front of me, they do that much more here than in any other station.< /text>< username>

Centrally located for downtown, this stop is a good location for MUNI aboveground.  A lot of MUNI busses connect here aboveground.  Because this station is underground, there are no trash cans available on the platform.<//review>

This BART station is where I get off for work.

However, it's the BEST bart station because it connects to underground Muni as well as usually has really good street performers. It also connects the busiest muni line above ground to the 38 and the 38L.

It's usually pretty busy here since it's the station in the heart of the FiDi and it's usually not as lost tourist filled as Powell.</Review>

I used a lift because I had a lot of luggage, but I felt a slightly dangerous atmosphere. In the case of sightseeing between women, I think that it is better to be careful. Although this elevator is not considered in Japan, a plate with "no toilet" is affixed. There is a considerable ammonia odor in the box, so it may be better for men to refrain from using it.

日本からの渡米で利用させていただきました。
荷物が多かったのでエレベーターを使ったのですが、少々危険な雰囲気を感じました。女性同士での観光の場合は気をつけた方が良いと思います。このエレベーターですが、日本では考えられませんが「トイレ禁止」のプレートが貼られています。箱の中はかなりアンモニア臭が漂っていますので、男性でも利用は控えたほうが良いかも知れません。< /Text>< Pictures>

Very helpful staff. They guide you on the DIY project and try to save some money. They have wide collection of LEDs. Most importantly they are local for Glendale/Burbank community.<//Text>

I don't usually write reviews, however, I thought I should share with you about my wonderful experience when I visited Advance LED Supply. The staff were so helpful and knowledgeable and they answered every question that I had plus they demonstrated a few different Scenarios which worked just perfectly at my new patio. Their prices were 20% less than a major department store.
Best,

I usually would buy my led lights online.  It is much better to see them in person though.

Great prices and excellent service as well. Plus free coffee.</review>

<Review>Would give them 11 stars if I could! Raffi saved the day for me! And everyone was so friendly (one employee even offered me a donut while I was waiting! What business does that!), and genuinely helpful!

The story: Brought in my flashing LED hat to be fixed which had a wire loose. I desperately needed it for a costume I wore the next day for a career-making "America's Got Talent" audition.

Raffi was a lifesaver! He figured out EXACTLY where the wire needed to be soldered to flash again.

Bottom line: The flashing LED hat really made the costume, and I strongly believe it elevated my crucial AGT audition - including a lengthy on-camera interview I was chosen to give which may likely air on the AGT national promo on NBC!

If it wasn't for these guys, my costume wouldn't have had the pizzaz without a flashing LED hat. I'm immensely appreciative & grateful to Advance LED Supply!

And can't wait to do business with them again!</Review>< gmapID>

I bought 38 feet of led strips . When I installed them on my display case the light was a really  cheap,  Chinese quality tone or spectrum .It made the  objects in the display case look cheap or gawdy.   I was really disappointed . Of course they dont allow returns or exchanges . I lost several hundred dollars and the only think that makes me feel better is preventing someone from making the same mistake I did . Demand they let you exchange or return or walk away.<//Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1510268148117, 'text': 'It appears that you ordered a custom LED light.  And it is reasonable not to do returns or exchanges on a custom order we cut to size. Our company offers a variety of options to meet the needs of our customers’ budget. Many of our customers have ordered our standard line of custom LED light and were happy with the quality. But we also do offer a higher end CRI +90 series with a variety of brightness levels. Our customers can request samples in order to make sure the light is suitable for their application.'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I would like to thank Mar who always does my eyebrows. She always makes me comfortable every time she waxes my eyebrows, and also she is very detailed oriented. She knows her products well and always gives me options on what kind of eyebrows products I need to use. Lastly, she is very helpful person in all aspect. So, guys if you need someone to wax your brows just go to Benefit Macy's Modesto and look for Mar. She is the best and awesome. Thanks again  Mar.< /Text><response>{'time': 1628535525312, 'text': "We are thrilled to hear you had a great experience with Mar!

I love Tara at Benefit.  I hadn’t had my brows waxed in months because of the pandemic and Tara shaped me perfectly....she listened to what I wanted and delivered on exactly what I hoped for....I would recommend everyone at Benefit Brow at Macy’s  Modesto. They deliver a comfortable, friendly and engaging experience!  Go to Benefit Brows!<//Review>

I must admit. Mar is my favorite Brow artist if I do say so myself. She was able to turn my full caterpillar brow into two beautiful butterflies, and girl let’s not even get started on my full lip showdown I had going strong. Mar made me feel like an actual Woman.. drop the man... if your in need of rescue my friend please go to Mar she’s the best no judgement.

I got 99 problems but my brows an lip ain’t one!<//text>

I always go to Rebecca to get my brows done with benefit, and she always does a phenomenal job! I will never trust anyone else with my brows, after many terrible waxes elsewhere. If you need your brows done, she is definitely you girl! She gets 10 stars from me!<//text>

I like the pizza here. It's better then Dominos in pizza. I got the pepperoni and mushroom soft crust . I did not like the bone in chicken wings here. I got 6 for 12$ with blue cheese 60cents. The mild ones. The problem was the mild hot sauce. Dominos hot sauce taste way better. The Domino's one was thicker bones .Everyone was so polite and it was like a 10 minute wait. I am going back for the pizza 😎 tho thanks 🐱</Text>

Guys really need to get a system going for non-delivery orders. Waited 30 minutes past the scheduled pickup time. Not to mention there's no waiting line area even though only one person allowed in at a time. Delivery only recommended from this Pizza Hut for now.</Review>

I always ask for well done everytime I order a stuffed crust from pizza hut on any location.  First time I get a burned pizza....$20....didn't go back because it was not worth the driving and inconvenience.  Now I know not to ever buy here.

It's the place for the perfect pizza with pizzaz! The food is always fresh, hot, and made quickly. I wish that this location would have some interior rennovations done because it is looking sad. However, the staff is quite friendly and professional and they double check to make sure your order is correct. There are seats inside while you wait and it's wheelchair accessible. There are no public restrooms available.</Review>

This is my go to spot as far as pizzas, the rest of their menu is exceptional as well. I've tried the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and it is 💣 af. I'm never disappointed when I go there!!</review>

Been doing business with this Pizza Hut for several years and I find that the staff is consistently friendly and the managers keep the place in good shape. Unfortunately there are times when the the product is sub-par meaning sometimes and I'll workers are lazy when it comes to making your pie.</Text>

Do not waste your time ordering pizza from this unprofessional company, I called, supposly the near pizza place from me and they showed up, I placed the order and the guy barely can hear me because it were like a chicken farm in the background. After more than 30 minutes waiting I saw a miss miss in my phone and I called back 5 minutes after I missed the call, the deliver guy didn't respond to me and I call again bact to their place and the lady told me that it were a call center who took my call and the order have been cancelled, they try to deliver to a different address. I would have to place the order again and wait another 45 mts , it was so disappointed.</Review>

<Text>I asked for mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers on a large pizza. I had several peppers scattered about and everything else was MIA.. It was a thin crust which was dry and very little cheese.. No worries because I'm good and will take my money somewhere else .<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I order from here frequently, day time, late night and usually through the app on my phone. No huge issue other than the occasional over looking the delivery instructions. Staff is friendly prices are competitive.</Text>

< Review>
Normally this Pizza Hut is pretty good, but this time.  It was Terrible!  I did a phone order of 2 mediums pizza (meat lovers & a Hawaiian) so it would be ready for carryout when I got there. Ricardo was very nice, he took my order & told it be ready in 20 minutes. However I got there a little quicker than expected so I paid for it and they said it be ready in just a bit so I sat down to wait the expected 5-8 minutes.  I thought it would have be busy because of Thursday Night NFL Football, but as I waited & watched, it wasn't busy. They only had 1 guy making a few pizzas. After 15 minutes I figured the they just forgot to call my name so I ask if mine was ready and they once again say it almost ready. I sat down & overheard one of the girls say "We have a problem ", & then I saw the guy in  a big rush making more pizzas. Well 2 of them must have been mine, because I had to wait another 25 minutes before they finally called my name. I  kindly asked if there had been a problem with the order. ...she say no. I ask what had taken so so long, why almost a full hour?  She told me twice that they were just really busy.  Bunch of BS, they were so busy that two guys were just chitchat right in front of me doing nothing while just 1 guy was actually making the pizzas and two girls cutting & boxing the pizzas. Damm, I hate when people Lie. I thought phoning in & picking up my order would be way quicker, but I totally wrong! I could have had it delivered in that time and not have wasted my time sitting there like a bump on log for 40 minutes. Very Disappointing!!!</Review>

I ordered a cheesy bites pizza. Half and half. When the delivery guy showed up he said sorry we don't have bites. Ok no problem. A courtesy call would have been nice before making the pizza though. It was supposed to be half veggie, half Hawaiian. I paid for the pizza, brought it inside and open the box to discover that it was mostly Hawaiian, one piece ONLY sauce, and all the veggie on one slice. How Un professional! The pizza was smashed against the front of the box and was coming out the side. A complaint will be filed! How pathetic....< /text>

This place sucks. Their manager sucks. Their customer service sucks. If there was another pizza place by me id order from them instead. Pizza Hut over here didn't always suck but their quality of service is horrible. Also they steal from you! And lie about not coming with change then when you let them know you mean business all of a sudden they have change. It's like come on now. I love giving tips but I'm not going to tip someone trying to steal from me tf? If you don't like your job get another job but how you going to steal from customers. Smh. This place is just horrible. They're so horrible they make me not even like Pizza anymore.</text>

<Review>This Pizza Hut is less then 1.4 miles from my house. Straight down the road 1 mile from their door front, turn left then go .4 miles. They refused to deliver to my area, they gave me a phone number to a pizza hut in Lemon Grove, over 10 miles away and said, "try them"... go figure. I ordered from Domino's instead.<//Review><rate>2< /rate>< resp>

I had a bad experience yesterday I'm pregnant so delivery is a thing for me well yesterday I ordered pizza and I guess I wasn't able to get it due to the delivery driver and business not reading directions I specified on my order that I had a 50 so I guess I had to leave home to get food some where else so basically don't order from here I'm making sure I let everyone I know not to go to this pizza hut and staff is so rude especially when asked for corporates number they wouldn't give me it< /Text>

So I placed the order at the local store and asked if they could shape the pizza into a heart. The nice lady on the phone said they had never done it before, but they'll try. Here's what my friend got! I was so surprised and seeing the pic of the pizza, it totally made my day! Thanks guys!< /review><user_name>RL Policar<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I keep ordering from this dominos and it is getting worse and worse. Today I ordered a large pepperoni pizza with double pepperoni and there was less than 30 pepperonis and the entire thing. I used to work at dominos and I understand the portion control but when a customer pays for double it is at least 40 or more. I also paid for extra cheese, cheddar cheese to be exact. There was 0 trace of cheddar cheese on it. Only the white pizza cheese. Several bubbles in my pizza.  I chose this over Little Caesars but I see now I made the wrong decision. The parm bites also were missing the parm only lightly covered with garlic sauce. This is embarrassing.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I love this particular Domino’s Pizza location. There is a location closer to my home, but I go to this one because their customer service is so much better.

Today, I came in very tired from work and was immediately greeted with a smile that just brought a smile to my face. The promptly made pizza and excellent service is what keeps me coming back.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Although they missed a few toppings, this dominos has outdone my expectations! They are very professional and they were quick to realize the mistake and offer me a replacement free of charge. Juan Carlos is truly a great person and very nice</Text>

< Review>
Very fast, fresh, and friendly service I got the lg pizzas 2 toppings 14" only 5.99 each  and let me  tell you they are far better than pizza hut those have actually meat/vegetables I mean for the price I don't expect them to be full of the chosen topping but pizza hut toppings are very poor,  Domino's the toppings are generous.< /Review>

< Review>
Order showed as delivered for over 30 minutes and it still hadn't arrived so I called the restaurant and they answered immediately to tell me the driver was in the area. 10 minutes later I call back and they say they will check and call me back immediately, 15 minutes after that the pizza arrives stone cold. I try to call back to tell them this and after being on hold for 30 minutes I still had no answer. Clearly these people know what they are doing... Save yourself and order from another franchise owner.</Review>

I am blown away by how Dominos has stepped up their game. The website is dialed-in. The delivery was FAST. The product is TASTY. I'm all in!< /text>

<Text>Editing a previous bad review. This is the closest location to my house, so we've ordered from here many many times over the years. Past few orders have been prompt and correct! The delivery man for those orders is super sweet and polite! Perhaps there has been a change of staff, I'm not sure, but I'm happy to revise my review for you guys. Thank you. I've definitely noticed a positive change!
Peace. Love. Pizza. 🍕<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Ordered a pizza online so that I wouldn't have to spend half my work lunch waiting for my pizza, arrived at the store 15 minutes later, a few minutes after the online system notified me that my pizza was ready. Not only was my pizza not ready, it wasn't even started. In addition, when I received my pizza 20 minutes later, (so that's a total of 35 minutes for my pizza, 20 of it sitting in the store after it should of already been done) and not only was it the wrong pizza but half of it was burnt black.</Review>

Ordered and paid online - picked up myself at Moulton store Laguna Hills. Pizza was ok but my credit card came back $1 more than my bill. Called corporate- they said the manager would call... never did. It’s not $1- it’s that employees are tipping themselves thinking no one will notice. Check your charges!<//review>

A nightmare experience. I ordered a medium pizza online and it said to arrive within 15-25 minutes. Since I didn't want to wait once I got there, I played it safe (or so I thought) and arrived in 30 minutes. Once I arrived, the clerk asked for my name, which I gave to him, and seemed a bit surprised and said it would be a few minutes. Approximately 10 minutes later, and clearly out of patience, I asked him if my pizza was ready yet. He goes to check and surprise surprise, my pizza was indeed ready. My guess is that it was ready several minutes prior to his checking. I come home ready and hoping to enjoy my pizza, and it was COLD. Almost like it had been out for quite some time.

Thanks for ruining my Sunday lunch. I doubt I'll be back.< /text>

I order from them while I am at work and they are always quick to deliver amazing quality food. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo with a belief it would be mediocre and it was amazing. The delivery drivers I have had have all been amazing and on time. By far my best experience with delivery food places<//review>

EVERY time we order our food arrives the fastest I've ever experienced. They have NEVER made a mistake on our orders and the delivery drivers are always very friendly and professional. Love that this store is our closest location. They've got their roles down to a science! The food is way better than any other pizza chain out there! Having 2yr old twins you are my go to answer for "crap I need dinner NOW!!"  Thank you all for saving our asses when needed!<//text>

Not very happy with I saw. Just left this location with my dinner but I noticed the young gentleman touch his face and nose while making my food! Not only that but he was eating behind the final stage area where you box the pizzas. So gross. Good thing it was a salad that I got.Some might not care about that but it's definitely not sanitary. Please have your staff get food safe certified.<//text>

<text>I ordered a pizza around 12:30PM online. I was using the Domino's tracker the whole time. It said the order was delivered around 1225PM. We did not get anything.

A similar thing happened before, the order was on its way at the time. Thinking this time it would be similar, I waited a little bit more.

I called the store around 1:45PM to follow-up with the order since it was not here yet. The man said it was in his rack waiting to be delivered but "somebody called to cancel the order". LIES. Nobody called them to cancel the order. You would think I'd get a notification if the order got cancelled but for them to say "somebody CALLED to cancel the order" is bs. He said it was already done and he is just waiting for someone to deliver it.

Now we are all sitting here waiting and very hungry. I used to like Domino's a lot. Oh well. Won't order from here ever again. Horrible experience.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Ordered delivery medium pepperoni yesterday.  They said delivery would take 45-60 min but was more like 90min and my location is close.  Pizza finally got here it was ok nothing great.  NOT worth $18 including tip.  For that price I could have gone to a gourmet pizza place or bought 2 large pizzas at the store.  I will NOT be getting pizza from Dominos again.<//Text>

<review>Guy who claims he is the manager and had "been with the company for nine years" refused to have a pizza delivered to me stating it was a "safety hazzard". Papa Johns delivered with no problem and stayed "safe". I think that manager heard my voice and assumed something. Well I happily gave Papa Johns my 30 dollar order. Don't think dominoes will ever get another dime of my money again.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Not sure I’ll order from here again. Pizzas just keep getting worse and worse.  Dry, over-cooked, very light on toppings, and more and more.  Think I’ll go with DoorDash or try Papa John’s next time. Sorry Domino’s - I gave you plenty of chances.</Review>

horrible service! Sylvia the night manager has a terrible attitude and horrible service. they delivered the wrong order. When i called to ask about the order, she gave me nothing but attitude, she talked over me, yelled and disrespected me! all because i asked why they sent the wrong order and if she could please send the correct order. HORRIBLE service!!!

I appeared like he has high because the first time he was getting out the car he dropped my Coke on the ground.

I specifically asked for no cheese. I am allergic. Looked like the chef messed up cuz he hid the cheese UNDER the sauce. Sneaky trick. Got my refund after giving them an earful. Funny thing was, when I called to tell them they messed up, they already knew which pizza it was. Hmmnn... I would have been fine with a phone call saying they were remaking it. But no, they hid it and I didn't know until after the first bite.
Never ordering from here again.< /Review>

Bad experience. No greeting and no  "Thank you" at the end. Kid seems like he didn't like the job. I don't think I'll try a second time. Bad face of the franchise.< /Review>

Rude enplyees. I called to ask if they deliver to Mission Viejo and the lady on the phone told me no we don't and I don't have time to get you the number of the one that does, we are to busy.. I said I didn't need the number I just wanted to know which one it was where was located so I can find the number myself. And she said its in Mission Viejo I said okay thank you have a nice night and she just hung up on me she didn't bother to say you're welcome or goodbye.. Horrible customer service I would rather drive an hour away then order from these people..<//text>

Their phone service is screwed up. I hear crazy sounds every time I call them. I thought it was Verizon at first but I have only had the problem with them. The idiot who I spoke with said I’m the only one to have this problem, he’s a liar</Review>

She is very talented and knows her craft. Her work is superb.  There's a guy there who sits towards the front and he can really do nails very well. All you have to do is tell him what you like and he will never disappoint you.  He is awesome.  I just need to find out his name because he did my nails and I absolutely love my nails. He is also the coolest guy. This shop is so neat so stylish.... music is so great.  And Tina does awesome relaxing Pedicures.  I love this salon.  I will not go to another nail salon because this is the neatest most professional nail salon I've been to in a long time. I love this place 😷😇❤🙏.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c29c14a21b1dc9:0x5789f8858cb4e74< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Place was really clean and very nice. I got a set of GelX nails and he finished them in less than 1 hour. They fell off 2 weeks later. The people there are very nice. Nikki reshaped them after she saw that I wasn’t completely satisfied, I get it maybe the nail tech was new to this. I would go back because they are very nice and clean place.< /Review>

Not only did the nail tech made me feel uncomfortable after telling him constantly I had a bf he continued to flirt with me until I checked him. My friend and I waited and it took 4 hours to get out of the salon. Poor quality and over expensive. I do not recommend it at all go spend your coin and worth elsewhere.</Review></record>

<review>Worst experience ever! It takes a lot for me to complain but my friend & I were literally in the salon for 4hrs. Aside from the wait time the gentleman working on us made my friend feel very uncomfortable. My nails look horrible even after he redid like 4 of my nails because they were so crooked & my fingers are literally so painful because he kept filing my nails & drilling them. My fingers were literally bleeding already. Please keep away from this place & spend your money else where.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>I have had the privilege of having Nikki as my nail tech & lash tech for years! Seriously life changing! There has NEVER been a time that perfect strangers have not complimented me on my nails! I have referred my friends family and co-worker's to her shop because there is no one better In the valley than her!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>Nikki is the best there is! I have been going to her for over 6 years she is always coming up with creative nail designs and always strives to make the customer happy. Her nails are not only high quality but she’s an amazing person so sweet really makes you feel comfortable. I would 100% recommend her if you wanna get some amazing nails!!!!</text>< Resp>

<text>absolutely horrible please don’t waste your time coming. I first walked in to an awful smell. Then, they wouldn’t tell me the price of a fill until i was finished which ended up being $70 (and they broke within a week). They were so extremely rude to my mother and they kept spraying alcohol on my hands. don’t waste your money on this business.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

<Review>received terrible service.

when Nikki began to file my nails, she kept burning my hand and took off skin around my cuticle. I tried to speak up and watched as she rolled her eyes. Then when she noticed herself, she made it seem as if it was my fault. She kept stopping in between doing my nails to check her phone and to text. I was so dissatisfied with the service I received.< /Review>< resp>

I love getting my nails done here! You definitely need to schedule an appointment in advance since they are usually booked up, but worth it. Everyone is very nice, and it is always clean.  Anita does amazing acrylics, she is the best!!</Text>

I got a full set of acrylic nails.. they do take their time and are gentle. I like them natural in appearance and not very thick.  Since it's been several years since I've has them, I couldn't tell how thick they were until I wore them a few hours.. I realized I didn't care for the extra thickness I felt and could see on closer examining.  I did call Fingertips and explained and was told "no problem, and I could come in for a fix." They were very accommodating and  Natalie, filled them down perfectly and reapplied the gel nail polish.  I'm very pleased and there was no additional charge. And the young lady who initially put the set on, I have no complaints with her,she way very sweet and personable.  Her technique is just thicker than I prefer.  A very nice shop and well run  with high customer satisfaction . I will recommend to others.</Text>

This was my first and last time at this place!!!
When I called to book appointment, I was told they have just 345pm available if I can make it. I was there two minutes early and the girl in front who was so rude with no customer service told me to wait. I waited 25 minutes while two of the nail techs were siting at their table were doing nothing and were just staring at me!!!
I finally said I’ll leave right away if no one can take me now and I was finally sorted and someone came to do me pedicure.
I told that girl that I have in growing on my both big toes and she said,” I can’t do anything with in growing as we are not allowed to and you need to see specialist”!!!!!! I told her so your telling me for the past 20 years all the nail salons were doing something wrong by taking care of the in growing!!!
That rude girl came and asked her whether she knows how to do it and she said yes but I am not supposed to.
All my nails were uneven and not even shortened to the point I asked for!!
I just asked the girl just to clean my nails sand finish it.
When I called to make app that girl, the rude front girl quoted me $18 just for pedicure but when I went to pay she charged me $25 and when I asked why, in a very rude and unprofessional way she said that’s the price and I don’t know who told you $18. She was the most unpleasant and rude person lve ever dealt with.
I will never go back there.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c29c14a21b1dc9:0x5789f8858cb4e74</Gmap_id><Text>NEW MGMT BEWARE! I loved this place and have been going for a few years.  I go for a fill every few weeks.  When I tried to make an appt with my regular nail aesthetician, I was told she moved away, which seemed odd.  Nataly never mentioned it 2 weeks earlier.  I was told they had someone even better for me.  What I wasn’t told was that apparently over the last few weeks, the shop went under completely new management with an entirely new staff.  The new staff is friendly but not nearly as experienced.  My “incredibly talented” tech seemed to be in high school.   No checking to see if acrylic was lifting, only filing and applying fresh acrylic and a sloppy job of smoothing it out.  I didn’t notice any cosmetology license or sanitation system in place for instruments but since none were used on me to clip away old acrylic, I can’t say for sure.  When I got home, I noticed lots of dents, lumps and bumps in the acrylic.  Horribly uneven and they don’t even look filled.  The new acrylic started lifting 3 days later. She just built up thick acrylic exactly at the grow out point.  They offer free fixes within 48 hours but It was such a bad job, why would I go back?  When I went to settle up, I learned this new management increased fills to $45!!!  A $10 increase from 3 weeks earlier.   When I made the appt, I should have been advised of their new rates and new Mgmt. Wouldn’t be as bad if they did a stellar job but may be the worst fill I’ve ever had.  It’s only been a week and now I have fungus under my nails and have to have the acrylic removed.  So sad - this WAS a great place.<//Text>< Time>

< Review>
Unwelcoming and unprofessional. I called on the way home from work and immediately put on hold. Since I got to location and was STILL ON HOLD I went inside and the receptionist was playing on her phone. She definitely was "very busy" for my phone call... asked if they could take me for a pink and white fill. "We don't do pink and white fill and we don't have any availability until Tuesday."  It was Friday at 4:30pm when I went in and they weren't busy... I felt very unwelcome there. And pricing for services was more than I would want to pay when I know I can get the same service for cheaper somewhere else. I DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend this place.< /Review>

Does not take walk ins, fills by appointment only which are booked out two weeks. I feel that should be known when googling local salons. Or post a sign? That parking lot is actual hell to get into. I wasted 20 minutes just trying to park, hot nails around the corner gave me a perfect fill in less than 20 minutes without waiting.< /review>

<Text>My first and last phone call to this business:  I called two full weeks in advance to request an appointment and was told "no time available until 3 days later".  So, I booked the appointment anyway for the later date.  Then, I was told that I would need to provide a credit card number in order to hold the appointment.  I refuse to give a total stranger my credit card number for an appointment that hasn't even happened yet!!!  I will not be getting my nails done here.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I have been coming here since this nail salon has opened and I haven't been anywhere else since! The customer service is excellent and their work is the best. I leave a happy customer every time. There has been several time that I needed to take my children with me when I go and the employees and owner don't mind at all. They actually help. I like that they make you feel welcomed and comfortable. Not to mention the great wide selection of nail polish colors they carry. They have high end brands like OPI and Essie which I appreciate. Not once have I went and seen this nail shop dirty. The employees are always cleaning the chairs, floors and etc. Nail fungus is not fun. Going to a clean nail salon is extremely and equally important to me as their work. I highly recommend this nail salon to everyone.<//Review><name>SUSAN ASH</name>< Rate>

Great nail salon! The staff is wonderful and the owner is so sweet! This is hands down the cleanest salon in the valley, I've been to many nail salons and the prices here are very good. Once you walk in you just feel a great vibe, I come here every week and that will never change!</text>

I absolutely love coming to this nail salon. There is no awful smell of acetone smothering you as you get your nails done, everyone is so friendly, and the job you get is really outstanding. I came in to get my nails done for my wedding, but didn't quite know how I wanted my fingernails. The girl who did them (I'm so sorry I can't remember your name. I'm terrible with them!!!) Knew exactly what to do for my nails and I LOVE THEM! They came out beautiful and classy and simple, but they truly stand out. Thank you so much for the wonderful care you all showed, and I would definitely recommend that everyone come to this salon!</text>

I agree with Valerie and some of the others. I gave this place 2 chances. So first do you know why they arealways fully booked? Not because they are so good, but because they are always short staffed..
When you come in, the girl at the front who is the manager. Which is surprising as she has no customer service knowledge AT ALL, does not greet you, does not smile, but rather in a very sharp tone asks youdo you have an appointment??
This is the 2nd time that they gorget to book me for a pedicure. I distinctively booked it....and on top of everything else,  had a nail with fungus so they refused to take me when they had already started and did m6 nails a month BEFORE! so if you disinfect your tools whats the problem, and besides,  you could have offered to do all the nails other than the bad one. HORRIBLE ATTITUDE!<//text>

ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE THEIR EMPLOYEES!!!!!!
I do not recommend this place at all! The customer service is terrible. They think they are so cool using the F word in front of customer all the time,,,, The Gel manicure that I did pilled in two days I had to go back two times to get it fix and after spending all that money the girl who was fixing my nail acting like that she is doing me a favor fixing my nail which was ruined in two days and I told her this should last me two to three weeks and she said you complain too much and I won't fix your nail!!!!!! and they told me that the owner JUDE will call me which she never did and I had to go back there for the fourth time and had the front desk girl to call her and she hardly spoke to me and said I will not refund your money!!!!!! and the girl from the day before was yelling at me and was sooooo disrespectful!!!! I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND THE PLACE TO ANYONE!< /Text>< pics>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>At Your Fingertips... do all of your nail technicians' text constantly while they do nails? I called in to see if I could walk in to get my gels off. The receptionist was very accommodating. The issues came when they started with my nails. I had gel nails on with three acrylic nails. I wanted them off and just clean. The first technician automatically took out the drill and went straight to it. I started to feel my nails burning because not only was she taking the gel and acrylic (grown out half way on my nail) but she was also shaving off my nail bed! I immediately took my hand away from her and she profoundly apologized. She lowered the speed and told me to tell her when my nail would start getting hot. I made her stop a few times because she kept on using the drill on my nailbed on the bottom half of my nail. She took off the majority of nail off then I was ushered to an empty station and started to soak my hands for about an hour. Here is when the second technician comes in. She comes to the station, puts down her phone then disappears to get her cart of supplies. She comes back, doesn't say a word and checks her phone and starts texting for a few minutes. I spoke up and asked if I should take out my hands since they have been in the acetone for 45 mins. Still not saying anything she puts down her phone, pick up a cuticle pusher and starts scraping off at my nail. I indicated to her that she was working on the nail that did not have the acrylic and pointed out at the ones that did. Again, does not say a thing, sees that she got a text, put my hand back in the acetone then starts texting for a minute or two again. This continued for the entire duration. I am not asking for a conversation but I think it would be courteous to At Your Fingertip's future customers that they do not carry their salon in an unprofessional manner. I only say this because the technician was much more concentrated about her phone than the customer that she was working on. That may not be the case for your other technicians but I never seen a technicians phone out at any other nail salon unless they were taking a picture of their work. Both technicians that I had encountered had their phones placed on their stations.

I came out a bit irked with scraped nails and a messy polish that showed the distractive nature my technician.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Nice place awesome owner too! she actually works there too. Not just an owner that stands in the back ground and collects money. She's a hard worker her self. I drive from Santa Clarita to go there. Well worth the drive. You can get your nails done, eyebrows, lashes. Very comfortable setting aswell. Appointments a must they are busy.</text>

Excellent little place in Chinatown. The Hunan smoked pork was out of this world.  We also had the Hunan Chicken which was also great.  Both had a very nice heat that would sneak up on you.  Lots of food for very reasonable prices.  We picked a winner with this place.</Text>

Compared to other Pandas, the food is about the same in quality - however, due to the HUGE number of students they serve, the food is always fresh and hot during the quarter. The line moves fast and the prices are average. It's a good eating option on campus< /Review>

Extremely rude staff. My friend and I got two different orders, they put it into one, and the girl cashier gave us attitude for not telling her it was two separate orders. On top of that, they were speaking Spanish the entire time making it feel like they were talking smack about us behind the counter. The food was not good either since the chow mein and rice was dry and on top of that I got more oil and mushrooms than steak for the Shanghai Angus Steak, also being charged $1.25 more. I will not come back here</text>

Served very small  portions and when I asked for more because the amount claimed to have 41 grams of protein I was told that's the amount when it was half as much as I got at every other Panda Express I had ever been too< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I love the orange chicken here! The rice is a little dry compared to the Japanese one, but you can eat it. You may not need a fortune cookie that you give me every time ... Your mouth will be moisturized.

ここのオレンジチキンが大好きです！ご飯は日本のものに比べるとちょっとぱさぱさしてるけど、食べれます。毎回くれるフォーチュンクッキーはいらないかも・・口の水分がとられます。<//text>

< review>
I've been a Mancini sleepworld customer for years now.(recently had to replace mattress due to accidents that occurred while I was gone on vacation) I feel they have a great selection to suit most everybody.. what keeps me coming back though is the customer service due in part to
Bill "the bed guy" or Bill "the mattress Man" whatever you prefer to call him. He will make sure you have great customer service and more importantly you can trust him with you and your family's comfort and sleep.. so for you and your family sake and most important your glorious sleepy nights.. I recommend you go to Bill.</review>

He took his time to explain I was greeted very well by him. He explained everything about the mattress he closes at 8o’clock he stay there until 9 o’clock and never said anything!

Anywhere else you go they’ll just throw out out the door they don’t even know how to say hello.

They have a very nice selection of everything I was very happy I recommend anybody go here don’t need to go anywhere else!

Bill was very professional took his time to explain things never in a rush just great customer service you can never find it ! You go anywhere else you’re just standing like a dummy looking they walk right by you don’t even know what to say hey do you need any help

Thank you bill for your help!</review>< rating>

My experience with the store was neutral. There were good and bad things. Watch out for Premier Inspections (who handles all of their inspections for your warranty, and they are deplorable). The manager, when he was appraised of the issue, handled the matter promptly and respectfully in direct contrast to Premier Inspections. When getting a matress, be sure to invest a lot of money, otherwise, you are unlikely to get a product that will hold up.</Text>

<review>This is the worst mattress I have ever purchased! We paid $1600 and have had nothing but issues from the get go! its only been 6 months and we have shoulder, neck and back issues. I swear this mattress has a lump straight down between my husband and I. I spoke to the sales guy and he recommended we walk all around the mattress to even it out. (Ok) We did this and made no difference! They only give you 3 months to see if it will fit your needs, what kind of timeframe is that. I will never buy or recommend Mancini’s, they sell defects!<//review></record></dataset><record>

By letting me know I have a 10 year warranty and helped me with my claim, now that the store reopened I went in to see Bill and once again greeted me with a smile and helped me complete my claim. Mancini’s will have my business for life because of employers like Bill.<//text><response>None< /response></record>

I received the same bed I was pricing at competing store for $2000 cheaper than most other places, and I also received upgrades the other stores charged for. I also received great financing at a great payment with no interest.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I explained to him that I am a restaurant manager so I'm on my feet all day and a good nights rest is crucial. I pretty much knew the feel I wanted for my bed so he was really quick to point me in the right direction for the perfect fit. He was so patient and helpful with my unruly toddler, even sharing his snacks he had with her to keep her occupied. His professionalism yet personable personality made this experience so nice. It was my first time ever buying a nice bed and he made it so easy. The delivery service was great and on time and I am so excited to finally get the good nights rest I deserve. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone looking for a new bed.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809051b3a37f2803:0x1a2233a53c2bb713<//Gmap_id></record>

Went to a local place and needed a box spring. They said we needed to order it. The guy at Mancini sold me what he had, which was the display. I'm very happy he didn't refuse the sale. Now mom has a new bed and I was able to check something off my to-do list. I'll go here next time. This guy's a problem solver.<//Text>

<text>If you're looking for a great deal, quality furniture or just some bedroom basics, then look no further. Mancini has a wide selection of brand name products and best of all, they're fairly priced. My wife and I got a king mattress, box spring and frame cheaper than anywhere else we looked. About 6 months later, our box spring started making a squeaking sound and all it took was one phone call to Mancini's employee Rob, who sold us our set, to quickly warranty our boxspring. Rob is a great guy and a delight to deal with. He took great care of us from the start. If you go here, ask for Rob, he will do his absolute best to take care of you and your needs.<//text></record>

Robert my salesperson at the Modesto store on Sisk Road was AMAZING!!!!! I can not say enough great things about his professionalism and assistance. He made sure I was going to be a satisfied customer. He worked with me to ensure he heard what I wanted and needed and he found just the right mattress and pillows for me. I even bought extra accessories because he truly explained the great benefits of each item. Me and my partner sleep sooooooo much better and I look forward to going to bed at night again and I love waking up refreshed and ready to get going in the morning. Give Robert a raise, he deserves it...5 star service indeed!!!! Go see Robert for a good night sleep!!!!!<//review>

I bought an adjustable base together with a mattress and I just love it! Robert was the sales person that helped us and he is excellent. I love Mancini sleep world because you get a good deal and the merchandise is good quality. I purchased a mattress from them some 20 years ago and it was only now that I’ve purchased a new mattress.< /Text>

Customer service is great the moment you enter their store til the drop off of your preferred bed to your residence, also you get a call asking if everything went fine with delivery.  My back pain had very much improved and its easier for me to get in and out of the bed. I would suggest this store to any one looking for the perfect bed of comfort for their back.<//Review>

Called mattress firm they could care less bout my business. Went in here I'll echo what others have said customer service is excellent. They were expedient but not pushy....let us walk around and try mattresses and seem to check on us at exactly the right moment. Great place and still family owned. Will never buy bedding anywhere else.<//Text>

In the past I had received good customer service from Mancini Modesto so I have purchased $$$$$ of dollars worth of merchandise from them over the last 15 years.
However, my most recent experience with them has caused me to decide to NEVER purchase from their company again and never recommend their company to anyone.
I visited their store on Sisk Road on a
Sunday and spoke with a very helpful salesperson named Shawn. I was not able to make a definite decision concerning the two beds I was looking at that day, as I wanted my grandchildren whom I was purchasing the bed for to help in the decision making. He gave me his card and I told him I would return in a few days, my grandkids with me.
When I returned that next week, I asked for Shawn but he had not arrived at work yet.Kevin said he could help me as it didn’t matter who helped me, I find out later, they earn a commission, and Kevin had just stole a client from Shawn, me, not realizing what he was doing. I was wondering why things got really awkward when Shawn arrived a few minutes later. When I tried talking to Shawn, the store manager started acting funny, and saying odd things to Shawn. Kevin continued to help me in stead of letting Shawn and I pick up from where we had started days before in our process. That should have been my first clue, but I was distracted by my grandkids looking at the different beds and in the end being offered cold drinks.
Kevin continued to be deceitful as when I asked very specific, purchase deciding questions, he lied to me.
I had asked very specifically if the double sized captain beds that had drawers on one side also had a wall on the opposite side of the bed so that they could be placed in the middle of a room. I was told “Yes” absolutely. He even supposedly double checked. I was only purchasing them if they had an enclosed side. It was a deal breaker.
I had mentioned that I was also, considering an adjustable platform, at which time the manager said he would show me what they had, still not realizing that I was being played by Rob and Kevin.
I purchased (2) double size captain beds which they had to order and an adjustable base thinking they were taking good care of me.
When I called to see when the beds would be delivered, I was told they were waiting on some pieces. They never once said anything about no sides to the beds.
When they did deliver the beds, I was not home, my son was home so I didn’t get to see them put together . When I checked the beds upon my return and found out they had no sides, the manager Rob had stated that Kevin had made that mistake before, and his only offer to resolve the issue was to sell me two additional drawer sets for the other sides of the beds “at a reduced price “.
I emailed pictures to Kevin and told him I was not interested in Purchasing anything else from him or that store. I never heard from anyone from Mancini Sleep World Sisk Road again . $3600 spent two beds that will never be able to be placed anywhere but in a corner where they are hard to make, and to hide the whole on the other side
Lie to me, cheat your colleague,
Thank you Mancinis lesson learned</Text>

< review>
Once the best sales associate (larry) left this location for one in the bay area the customer service went down the drain to an all time low. The two men that started to help us were completely unprofessional to the point my wife and I walked out of the store. While we discussed what we were looking for the sales rep recieved a call that he did not want to answer. Come to find out the lady that called him wanted to let him know of his mistake. He charged her extra on her order. This was all explained to us as we were debating doing business there. Once he realized his mistake he stopped in the middle of our conversation to fix the problem that he cause without even saying another word to us, as if we were not even present or a paying customer. After feeling so disrespected and unimportant we got up and left the store. As we were leaving he tried to apologizes, while still on the phone with the lady he made the mistake with. BE AWARE WHEN YOU WALK INTO THIS PLACE. Check your receipts .< /review>

<text>Came here for a mattress for our daughter's first "big girl" bed and had an awesome experience. Came in looking for a mattress, bunkie board, and mattress cover and this store had everything but the bunkie board for a full-size, but could have been ordered. Rob was amazingly helpful and went far out of his way to look for us a board and ended up finding a set of slats from a different kit. The amount of jokes and ease of conversation between Rob and Larry was hysterical to say the least and made for a very fun and personable experience. Our daughter got a very nice, new, and comfortable mattress that was actually nicer and cheaper than even Big Lots, and this one came with a warranty. Happy to say we will be coming back for our own mattress and to work with Rob and Larry!< /text><userid>114241137015833586621<//userid>< Response>

I needed a new mattress and my friend decided Mancini’s in Modesto was my best bet to look at multiples. I went just to look, but eneded up purchasing that night because I could not pass up my dream bed. The salesman was fantastic and took his time with me. I highly recommend starting your search here.< /Review>

We've purchased several beds there over the years. We decided our last bed was too firm. We were able to exchange it after a month. The process was easy and the customer service was excellent throughout. (Salesman was Kevin.) We'll get our next bed there as well.<//Text>

Rob Salkow has sold me 3 beds over rhe years, and it has always been a pleasure to do business with him. The beds have always been excellent quality, and have retained their comfort many years after the warranty has expired. The price is much more affordable than the competition, and delivered on time, with no hassle for set up or take away. I'm a customer for life due to Rob's dedication to giving deal a great deal on a quality product every time.<//review>

<date>1382111082788< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Perfect customer service and super patient when my Husband and I picked out our new bed.  They are almost always willing to work the price for you to get it as cheap as they possibly can without losing too much money for their company.  The gentleman that helped us was very laid back, but professional which made it much easier to chose the perfect bed.  You can exchange any brand new mattress within, I believe, 120 days and they really strive to make you have the perfect bed.  Even better was that our bed was delivered the very next day.  I will go back in the future be it to shop with friends or when we want another bed.  Great customer service and excellent selection.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x809051b3a37f2803:0x1a2233a53c2bb713< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The best customer service hands down!  Called to let us know within the hour it would be delivered and then again followed up to let us know they would be arriving in 5-10 minutes.  Delivery drivers were fast, cautious, and most importantly friendly.< /Review>

We were looking to up size our bed, not really needing a new one, and stopped by Mancini's, we were assisted by a store associate who recommended a bed that would fit our needs and quality we were looking for. We found a bed set on the high end of the sets that were recommended for us.   After expressing some concerns to the associate, we were assured the set would "last" . After 15 months the bed now has body dimples where we have been sleeping and the box mattress is breaking down as well. Now you would think that a bed set would "last" a little longer than 15 months.  We have contacted the store but they have been unwilling to work with us on the situation. but explained that there was nothing they could due for us due to the trial basis was over and the problem was out of there hands. There was no offer to to try to make this right, not even an apology for our dissatisfaction. Now we did ask about an extended warranty and were again assured that the model and style we chose would outlast ANY warranty they could offer due to the quality of products/workmanship they use and they would stand by there products. good luck< /Text>

<review>When we bought the mattress we were told by Bill that it would be delivered Monday "garenteed". He said he had set it up and there would be no problem. On Monday my wife and I woke up took our matress outside and left it out there. Our bed set we ordered also was coming Monday so it was going to work out perfectly. When we called Bill at Mancinis to ask when the matress was going to come in at about 3pm he then told us that something happened and somehow it got booked for Thursday. We explained to Bill that our matress was already outside and we had nothing to sleep on, which meant that the next two night we would have to sleep on the hardwood floor. He apologize and offered us a pair of sheets to compensate for the inconvenience. He then re booked for Wednesday because that was the earliest it could be delivered. As a result I had to take Wednesday off from work so I could intercept the delivery and then was given a window between 530 to 730.  We already had reservations to go out, so it would work out perfectly again. At about 540pm we get a call from the wearhouse and they stated that the truck is running late and now wound be there till between 730 and 830. I explained that we had plans to go out and if there's anything they could do. Rebecca at the wearhouse said was there nothing they can do to reroute the truck because we were one of the last stops and the only thing is to reschedule for friday, which would mean taking another unnecessary day off. So we canceled our plans to go out to dinner and waited for the the truck to arrive which didn't get there till about 810. Bill had good customer service but the follow through was horrible</review><rate>1< /rate>< Date>

<date>1512003165462< /date><review>Great prices, bought a King  Icomfort mattress for almost half the price I would of got it from local competitors. We talked to Brian and it was a refreshing sales experience didnt feel like i was  dealing with a loan officer, he simply showed us what we where looking for and let us make are decision with out any pressure or sales gemmicks. Once we picked one out they matched the competitors price by $200 and gave us a 30% discount on top of that. Don't buy your mattress from any where else before u go here.</review></record></dataset><record>

A couple years ago we bought a mattress and thought customer svc was great. A few months ago I went in to buy a large bean bag chair. It was filled very well when we got it and very I was very happy. My grandkids have been wanting to take it home so I decided to buy them their own for Christmas. Was very disappointed the bags had practically no beans in them. The person who helped said it was from kids sitting on them and he would throw in a free bag of beans and he would get two new ones that would arrive on thursday and be packed with more beans.. I  thought that was very nice. We paid for 3 large bean bag chairs. Well my husband picked them up and they were wrapped in plastic. Right away I got suspicious because the other ones we bought weren't wrapped. we unwrapped them they were not like our first one they had very few beans and one had less than the 2nd one we got. So needless to say we need to go back for more beans to fill our brand new bags, that supposedly are new and not used.  Our first bag has been sit on jumped on and it still has more beans than any of the 3 new ones. This is my last time for buying a mattress or bean bags from them because I feel they just took the old ones in the store and wrapped them in plastic and said they were new ones not used. Had I not been working I would have unwrapped them and checked before bringing them home. I am not buying a new mattress or beanbag chairs there anymore. I  feel like I got ripped off.<//text>

We had tried a Sleep Number bed(from the actual Sleep Number store), and ended up feeling like it was just not right for our needs.

We came to Mancini's to try to find ourselves a new TempurPedic(we had one prior that lasted us 16 years). David ended up helping us out, and did a fantastic job explaining the differences in the new types that weren't available when we first purchased. He didn't pressure is too much, and we felt comfortable leaving without making the initial purchase to make sure it is what we wanted to do, as we have a rule not to make decisions in front of salespeople(pressure makes people make bad decisions).

We left, and came back a few days later to finally purchase, and he was very helpful finding the right match bedframe. We are excited to get delivery tomorrow!<//Review>

<text>This place has went down the hill, it used to be full of laughs, family friendly that quickly went away. Stars pizza joint next to 7/11 was good priced pizza. It's over crowded these days with site lookers who are known to drive by on there mountain bikes in groups shoving the locals out the way. Oh and there's almost never a old white man pulling his weeny out to a girl of any color asking if she will play with it. If you have kids this is not the crowd to have them around. It is very clean now and I really hope the homeless who used to sleep there where taken to a local homeless shelter just someplace other than thrown into jail because its a income for a lawman</text>< Pictures>

Lots of homeless people hanging out, which is totally fine for the most part, but could make parents of children uncomfortable. The trash bins were also full to the brim and swarming with flies. This unfortunately means that eating at the tables nearby is somewhat impossible. (Unless you like flies for some reason)< /Review>

Its quite like a normal park but with lots of homeless people.
Nice to take your kids or do exercise but... Just be careful.

Have seen several "questionable people" in this park.

Some "pros" of this park is that it has a Basketball area, a playground, several swings and lots of room for exercise.

It has some bathrooms ( that despite the sign saying they open on weekends, they never do).

And a water fount so you can drink water I guess...

Wouldn't recommend coming here after 8 pm<//Review>

Lots of potential here for this small park.  Just need to keep the 'wanna-be' gang members and homeless out.  Until then, only visit during DAYLIGHT HOUR!</Text>

<Review>Close to the house so we don't mind walking 2 blocks the only really big issue is that there has been an increasing number of homeless people populating the park more than usual there is also clothes hanging from the playground where the kids play bathrooms are sketchy always people in there doing their things wish the city or the Pomona pd would do something to clean up this park and as I was writing this review this second time there was a couple fighting and the dude slamming the door on his what appeared to be his laddy bad place to come or bring your kids<//Review>< pics>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Garfield Park.. I would want to give it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.. Simply because its a park that represents the area...the neighborhood that not just I grew up in but still at age 28 happen to live in..  It has been a place to see go through the changes as everyone.. And im glad to say where getting better.. Friendly calm environment..thats ofcourse if your used to seeing groups of ppl taking time to relax not just kids playing in the jungle gym.swings.skateboards or what I like to call balance boards ... Yay. To me for them... I 💛them... Plus many more I just dont quiet know the name to.them all.oh yea We have a 1/2 BASTKETBALL court.. That personally it doesnt matter what time of the day or night it is.. If. I need to get away.. Let stress.anger.. fustrations..sadness..or simply shoot some hoops you name it.. I go there.. Yes it might be a park in one of the busiest streets "HOLT AVE" but its right in the center of many homes.. And its a  a home on its own to many.. There are always night lights for safety.. And maybe the restrooms arent always open & need some work..but we can always call the city and they come over very quickly to open the doors.. Theres a COMMUNITY CENTER right across the st.. That many dont know of..but its nice to know. Kids have somewhere to go do H.W. get help.. Be with friend's and have a Park they could simply cross the st. And be able to play with friends.. Well maybe theres many updates still needed.. But at the end of the day.. We will get them.. And we will use the resources given prooudly....Till Both places are used more together... Does any one have a. BASKETBALL..or maybe..A ⚽.. how about Board games.. Or a cross walk for the kids safety..maybe even more..<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Garfield Park is one of the hard-hitting heartbreaks of Pomona. Driving by at any given time of day, it takes only but a moments glance to fully grasp the visual dissappointment that lingers within the confines of this potential-saturated community recreation area. The lovely overhang coming off the parks tree's cast a summer shade that, sadly, goes unloved by local families and instead is occupied by a number of the cities vagrants, addicts, and drug dealers. (And please, I beg of you, do not mistake my simple-minded observations for a bitter cast of judgement. I try to maintain a non-biased, open minded standard and position; yet to share an opinion, I must either carry a constant dull undertone, or instead speak from the heart.) So, as both a local and a family man, watching this most beautifully manicured and plotted bit of land that could bring a sense of warmth and comfort to a community, centered around the laughter of children and the smell of charcoal through  Autumn nights, and hints of sunscreen in Summer afternoons....day in and day out I see, instead, my minds safe haven tormented by the very bodies that seek shelter within it, and not from weather storms or nature's fury, but from the communities wondering eyes, seeking out the hardened hearts and jaded maids from which society has turned an apathetic eye and blindly guided here. The grass is but a field of landmines in the shapes of broken, dirty syringes and ripped baggy corners, tied and torn balloons, and shattered glass pipes and bottles. The men and woman whom are not the park visiting sort use drugs openly and without shame or merit. Not even an attempt to make themselves unnoticed or inconspicuous to the outside world that borders Garfield. This park is one of my personal raw nerves (I'm sure it's obvious) and on nights that fall too few and far between, when the city empties out, and for a moment the park itself lay still and holds no beating heart, I walk alone through it's somber, silent paths and think, "If only..."</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) It would be much nicer to get to this place and not find syringes and other nasty things. It is supposed to be an ideal place for children.

<review>I had a great experience working with Ali on my prenup. He’s extremely knowledgable with family law and was able to explain all he legal terms and laws to me as someone without any legal experience before. Throughout the process he was always available and quick to respond when schedules were tight. If I need legal representation again in the future I’ll no doubt return to Ali.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809ad6493edb1de1:0xb4fbef15d7163a89<//gmapID></record>

Ali was an incredible lawyer and friend during what was one of the hardest times of my life. I went through a chaotic divorce at the same time as taking care of my ailing father and didn’t think I would be able to find a stable footing in the world. I had no career or education to fall back on. But Ali made my future a reality. By making the navigation through the legal system absolutely minimal for me, I was able to focus on taking care of my father and on getting my degree. Ali was always available for an email or a call and never made me feel forgotten. He communicated concisely and clearly so as not to overburden me with legal fees. And he provided his own personal number so I could reach out to him at any time, considering how volatile my life was.

My father is healthier and my future is brighter because Ali explained every document to me, discussed my situation in detail, and was there for me every turn of the way. If you ever find yourself in such an unfortunate situation as divorce, know that Ali will be there for you, an advocate, a protector, and a friend. Thank you for everything, Ali.<//Text>

<text>Attorney Ali is an incredible person. I’ve never contacted and/or used an attorney before. At the time, I had a variety of law offices to choose from, but he pulled me— grabbing my attention and sheer focus. He attracted me to his law office because he seems down-to-earth, and felt like he can unbelievably relate to me, and my problem. He had talked to me in a voice tone that is friendly, understanding, and comfortable, in which he had sympathized with my troubles. He captivated me; garnered my interest in the entire process; guided me as to what to do and/or how to proceed, constantly communicated with me via email and/or by phone; explained the case details on employer/employee specifications, scenarios, and/or facts; provided me options and/or alternatives; and generally felt like he was a friend I could count on through the good times and bad times— particularly the bad times for me. He stayed with me for an entire year, and that was just really awesome!

Ali will not give up, and will ultimately fight for you in obtaining the best as much as he can and will! I highly recommend to have Attorney Ali and his law office team to help you!<//text>< pics>

<Review>Ali Yousefi and his staff are amazing.  I needed an attorney to help me with a restraining order.  They held my hand all the way through. Answered all my questions promptly and kept me up to date as to how and when things were going to take place.  They gave me the confidence not to worry about  my situation.  And in the end, all worked out to my satisfaction. I highly recommend the Law Offices of Ali Yousefi. Their professionalism and knowledge are unparalleled.  I felt they really cared about my case.  If you need a lawyer, give Ali Yousefi a call. You will be glad you did.

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>If you or someone you know needs an attorney for an issue, Ali is your man!

I have hired Ali for multiple different cases. My outcome was as good as I could have hoped each time. I've called him for advice on all issues and he's always available. If he's not, he emails or calls back within a few hours or so, which is not something you can say about most lawyers nowadays. There has not been a single time where I had to call more than once for him to get back to me.

Ali gives everything he has for you,  which in my opinion, is one of the most important things in picking an attorney. Until meeting Ali, I was not satisfied with other attorneys I met with. That was one of the main reasons I chose Ali, because he was available, compassionate and put in his all every time.

Everyone who has asked me to recommend an attorney, I've given them Ali's number with no hesitation.

He always fights for more and always aims for the best outcome putting everything he has into each client. He makes an effort to meet with his clients and doesn't put them off and lengthen the process because he's "busy" with a "more important case/client". He gives a detailed explanation of all possible options leaving you more encouraged and empowered because of his professionalism and compassion.

I wish I could give more than 5 stars for his efficiency, reliability, availability, and professionalism.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>I and my brother truly appreciated him for all his guidance. The help he gave us was very appreciated. He was very professional and provided above and beyond the level of service to us. He was easy to call and contact by email 24/7. He answered all our questions and eased our concerns. Without a doubt, the most professional lawyer I've ever dealt with. I wish I could nominate him for some kind of best attorney award because I truly think he deserves it.

I unequivocally recommend Mr. Yousefi. He is everything you need and want in an attorney: brilliant, dedicated, determined, thorough, pro-active, detail-oriented, efficient, informative, available, responsive, perceptive, assuring, patient, helpful, supportive, etc. During the consultation and throughout the process, he alleviated my stress level by being a calming communicator and consummate professional. I didn’t think it would be possible to make me feel that safe, positive, and righteous about my case. Mr. Yousefi’s rates are absolutely fair and completely transparent. He cares about you and your case, and is respectful and aware that your case may be the most stressful and daunting experience of your life. He is what all attorneys should strive to be. And I am thankful that he handled my case.<//review>

I was in desperate need of a lawyer for a situation I had with my employer. Mr. Yousefi took my case on with no problem. He was very persistent on getting stuff done and very fast. He stayed in great communication with me. Was always there when I had question. He was even on vacation out of the country and still stayed in communication and on top of my case. Settled is a very fast time frame. I would highly recommend Mr. Yousefi. Thank you very much for all your help and support</text>

This was my first time ever being involved with a law office and I'll admit I was blown away with the experience from start to finish. Ali was extremely easy to talk to from the moment he took the time to provide me with a 30 minute consultation. Through our final phone conversation, Ali always seemed eager to help, assure, and listen each and every time we spoke. I truly appreciated how caring, professional and dedicated Ali and his staff have been.

Sara was a pleasure to work with and made it very easy to get her the information she needed.  She was patient and understanding of my needs but relayed a strong sense of assurance and understanding that I would be taken care of.

In summary, I was given the trust and assurance that I could be honest, vulnerable and courageous in pursing a case with a sensitive labor subject matter. So grateful to Ali and his staff for the entire experience. I would highly recommend the Law offices of Ali Yousefi to any close friend or family in need.< /Review>

After tons of research and quite a few consultations I came across the Law Offices of Ali Yousefi. After seeing the great reviews I decided to contact Ali and was very glad that I did! It was a stressful time and Ali made sure to explain exactly what I should expect. He was very informative and communication was flawless from start to finish. Ali made the entire process painless and kept me updated every step of the way, answering all of my questions that came along. The process was handled quickly and with great professionalism. Highly recommended!< /review>

<review>Ali very recently represented me in a divorce.  I found him to be a very honest and trustworthy person throughout the few months we worked together.  I was clueless about the divorce process and quite shocked at some of the procedures and opposing counsel demands and Ali was very patient and understanding with me.  He made a very difficult time bearable for me.  With Ali, I felt that someone was on my side and doing everything possible to protect me.  I highly recommend Ali Yousefi to anyone who wants to work with someone honest and hardworking. He is high caliber and a blackbelt at his craft.< /review><name>Ana Bilbao Jimenez<//name>< Resp>

<Review>When one thinks of Divorce it is seen as Taboo and such a intimidating process. This will at times leaves individuals fearful and unable to move forward with the process. Well not in this case. I searched for months before I actually made the move to begin contacting Lawyers who would be able to handle my situation. When I located Ali, I was pleased by his prompt response and cheerful voice. He was up front, clear and honest about the process and the fees. This was one of the hardest things in my life to do but Ali made this process seamless. From the time of payment up until the very end was only 6-7 months! I would give him 10 stars if I could! He was always available by email and phone 24/7. At times I felt like I was harassing him as I was new to this process but he never made me feel uncomfortable. I have defiantly given his name as a references to others. Ali is efficient and worth the time and money! Please contact him for your legal needs-you will not be sorry!!</Review>< GmapID>

After looking around for an attorney for an employment case, I came across Ali and I'm so glad I did. I immediately signed the retainer agreement because I knew from just speaking to him he was the one. He is always there to answer any questions and responses to emails in a very well timely manner. He has helped me in so many ways possible and I can not thank him enough. If you are looking for an attorney for any of his practices, look no further because Ali is the one to call. Thank you Ali and his team for being so great st what you do.</text>

<text>Ali is a very efficient and knowledgeable lawyer and he helped me with a minor legal issue I was having last year. He is very quick in responding emails/text and also very cost-effective. He doesn't speak with the confusing law terms and makes sure you understand everything that is going on. It was a very quick process from start to end. Highly recommend his services.<//text>< pics>

After being let go from my job, I called around, looking for someone who could give me some information and possibly represent me in my employment case. Ali Yousefi offered a free consultation and upon speaking with him, I was pleased to discover a concise, helpful and informative attorney. I chose him to represent me and was very happy with the level of efficiency and professionalism used during the entire process. He walked me through everything, answered any questions or concerns I may have had, and also helped point me in the right direction when there were other complications with my employer separate from my case. Ali Yousefi and his associates were always kind and professional and I would definitely recommend him.< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>I have been around lawyers most of my life but this was my first experience personally needing a lawyer for a Civil Dispute. I had a matter that I wanted to deal with as quickly as possible but I was also unable to take time off in the middle of the day to go to any of the other offices I contacted via random google searches. Through a bar association referral service I was entitled to 3 consultations. My first and only was with Ali Yousefi. He reached out to me in lightening speed and let me use my full 30 minutes as I vented and panicked and picked his brain about options. His rates were perfectly with in the range the other firms had quoted and he was able to conduct the case via text, email, and phone due to my work situation. Mr. Yousefi responded to all my emails and phone calls in more than a timely fashion. I would say he was readily available even on weekends and always quick to respond.

More than anything else he was a great comfort and calming voice in a very tumultuous time. He was always very sensible and ready to collaboratively talk through some of the very weird and unusual aspects of my case. I never felt like my case was unimportant even though it was probably fairly minor as these things go. The potential for my case to have stretched out for 3 or more months was a very real possibility and I never could have done it with a lawyer that I didn't believe in, trust and have a rapport with. I truly can say that he made this really bizarre and awful situation better by being in my corner. I would hope to never need his services again but if I do I will be 100% confident in his services.< /text>< rate>

I've dealt with a few attorneys in my short life and Ali is one of the best I've had the pleasure of working with. Since the first day, he was straight with me and even mentioned multiple times that I may end up with nothing but a big legal bill and even discouraged me to hire him if my goal was to get a big settlement - this I especially appreciated since I knew he wasn't just in it for the money but to really help us. My case was complicated and was fighting an uphill battle against an entity with deep pockets (can't say too much more). However, Ali was prompted with all of his responses (email or phone call) and impeccable with timing - whether it was approaching deadlines or waiting and holding onto something until the right time before sending it off (showing really good judgment). Throughout it all, he was cordial, professional, and most of all patient with me which I really appreciated since this was a hectic time for me and my family. In the end, my lawsuit ended in the best case scenario for the complicated situation we were in and for that my family and I are truly appreciative.<//Text>

From the moment I picked up the phone and discussed my situation, Ali was engaged and ready to assist.  Ali was extremely helpful and explained each step in great detail.  A divorce is a very intense and emotional thing to experience but, with Ali he streamlined the process so I didn't have to worry anything.  If you're beginning the process and have no idea on how to start, where to go, and what your next step should be, Ali Yousefi is the person you should work with.  He is organized, fair and communicates with you every step of the way.<//review>

My husband and I shopped my employment case but after a few lawyers turned down our case, stating that we did not have one, we started to become discouraged. However, after coming across Ali's webpage and yelp, we decided to give him a call. Not only did Ali accept our case, but he told us exactly what to expect and how long it would take (not very long). During the entire process Ali was always available, attentive, and professional yet caring. Ultimately, Ali secured a settlement that we are pleased with and he did so quite fast (~ a little under two months). We highly recommend him to anyone who might have an employment related legal issue.<//Review>

<Text>This was my first time involved with a law office and I'll admit that Ali is extremely knowledgeable and helpful in providing me with the advice and closing my Auto Accident Personal Injury Case. I was hit by a car and at the beginning I don't know what to do and not even think of getting a lawyer to help. My husband suggest me to go through the legal process to save us from too much trouble. It turns out to be a smart decision. In the first call, Ali thoroughly went through all the legal options in this kind of case and set me an expectation of final compensation that we could probably get settled with, which turns out to be exactly met. The communication is direct and very clear, no any confusing law terms. He helped deal with all different parties, which I have to say that it saved me a lot of time and energy. He even worked with the medical insurance company and get a settlement much lower than the original one. I sincerely appreciate all the work Ali and his office have done for me.< /Text>< name>

I found myself in need of an honest personable attorney and office to review some legal documents received and to possibly retain their services.

Divorce is a very difficult ordeal to go through and can be confusing unless you either know the laws in place or have the pleasure of doing business with an attorney who knows not only the laws but is gracious and patient when speaking and explaining them. Ali was both of these and knowledgeable.

I'm on a budget and appreciate discounts and deals therefore when I located the 50% off of a consultation advertisement on Yelp I took advantage of it and Mr.Yousefi honored it.

I appreciate the affordable regular priced 1 hour consult either by telephone or in person of $200. Many attorneys charge over $400 an hour and some won't do telephone consultations as I required since it's over 2 hours for me to drive to his office from where I now reside.

To date I am very pleased with Ali Yousefi and the fact that he answered his own telephone each time I phoned him speaks volumes to me and his desire for a hands on approach to business.</text>

Ali and his partner, Sam, are extremely knowledgeable regarding family law and restraining order issues. They were always quick to respond via email/phone and were available past 9pm and early mornings!

<Review>I was extremely satisfied with Mr. Yousefi's services.  I was stuck in a very complicated contract that I could not get out of and with the help of Mr. Yousefi and his team, not only was my case settled it was also removed from my credit allowing me credit stability. The best part of working with this lovely team is that they move quickly and ensure that everything is complete to my satisfaction. He was always available to answer my questions or clear up any concerns that I had. Never have I felt so pleased before and is forever grateful for this law firm. I recommend him to anyone that's in need of assistance with debit collection or contract dispute.

<text>I recommend Ali Yousefi wholeheartedly to represent you in family law. After years of mental and physical abuse, I finally feel safe. After an incident with my sibling, I felt it necessary to call the police. After hearing what had transpired and hearing about the years of torment I had endured, the police recommended I get a restraining order against my sibling. I filed the restraining order but knew I needed an attorney because my sibling has a law degree and I just wanted to be safe and and do things right. I was referred to Ali Yousefi through the Bar and it has been a blessing ever since. He was able to put me at ease throughout the whole legal process. There were times I would cry and  feel the anxiety from all the pain that was locked up inside me, and it was Ali Yousefi who demonstrated heart, compassion and gave me the ability to stand up and persevere. After 5 months, Ali Yousefi set up a mediation and now I am safe from harm. I was able to get a Non-CLETS which very clearly identifies the code of conduct my sibling must follow or deal with legal repercussions. I am happy and for the first time in many years, I feel that I am out of harm’s way. I thank Ali Yousefi for everything he did and continues to do. He is efficient, professional, amicable and the most reliable person I have ever encountered. He made things right and even though this is his job and this is what he does, he did so much more for me that I will be forever grateful for who he is and what he does. Again, I recommend Ali Yousefi to anyone who is a victim of physical or mental abuse. He is to be honored for the work he does. I praise him and I hope to meet up with him again because he demonstrates amazing work ethics, professionalism but most of all, empathy.< /text>< user_name>

This is the first time I visited this place to check and buy some Shikakai powder or shampoo. Unfortunately, i did not find this item. But they are nice and helpful people. I bought some chapathi from here. They tasted fresh and tasty. They sell some good unique food stuff from inside restaurant. I would seriously recommend everyone to try this store. Thanks 😊< /review>

<text>This store always have lot of fresh veggies. The only problem is the space. But surprisingly they modified the access areas between aisles and really better way for easy shopping during this pandemic. Kudos for the modifications.<//text>< user>

<Review>Very good grocery store with too many options for fresh vegetables. Many fresh fruits also available.
It also has small restaurant inside where u can order food for to go.
Very good options as well for eating.
Snacks also available  like samosa , veg puff, pakoda etc.
Cleanliness  in the store is lacking, which has to be done very frequently.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< time>

<review>It was my first time to this location.. tucked away from the main road, Mowry Avenue, behind Olive Garden restaurant!
The store is quite spacious, big and wide enough aisles, all Indian groceries that you need. They also have a restaurant inside 👍
Plenty of parking, friendly customer service and good choice of fresh vegetables, reasonable prices.
And so close to 880!<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This place is not for online ordering, have ordered several times from this store, every time they either change the quantity  or change the brand to increase the price for online ordering. They substitute products even though I mention clearly" substitution not required pls refund". Their online ordering very similar to Bharat Bazar.</Review>

<Review>I'll give a 0 star if I could. Delivery services are pathetic most of the time their stuff is out of stock or whoever does the grocery is lazy. Because physically when I got there I found the item. Other than that delivery guy was complaining about them, that they messed up their delivery services. my order was supposed to be picked up between 10 to 1 but they hand him over my stuff around 1:30.</Review>< Resp>

<Review>The place is renovated recently. They have a kitchen and some place to sit and eat and also pick up. Food is tasty 😋. Always have stock of every Indian grocery. Home delivery is available too. One stop shop for everything.</Review></record>

This is the one of the biggest indian store in Fremont.This place is all the variety of all indian items from A-Z. It's little amazon for indian. The one bad thing about this store is lack of cleanness. when you maintaining a grocery store you need more cleanness. but this  store misses that.< /text>

<review>I usually shop at Bharat Bazar for our indian food and beauty needs, but my husband said India Cash & Carry has more snacks he likes that are hard to find so we went here this week. It was nice to see someone walking the aisles sweeping and cleaning. The line was HUGE, easily 20min wait even though we went on a weekday fairly late (9pm). Big selection of a little bit of everything and has a small takeout restaurant in the back of the store. Tempting smell wafting over and prices looked great so we'll go next time, tonight I needed veggies and spices to make vegetable biryani and eggplant okra subzi. Cashier was fast, line moved pretty good but just lots of people. Good price for okra so we stocked up. Lots of parking and good location pretty close to the freeway, but a tight squeeze inside the crowded store and pretty hectic. I think I'll just come here once a month to get spices and snacks and keep going to New India Bazar and Bharat Bazar for quieter, less crowded, less waiting around shopping.</review>< Pictures>

Seriously this place is a joke.

I for one have never understood why India Cash Carry cannot put labels on the aisles !! This would make shopping so much easier as is standard and expected in any grocery store ! If you're not Indian and we're looking for a specific item in the recipe it's a nightmare to navigate the aisles ! Despite this, it is one of the better maintained and "less" chaotic Indian grocery stores in the bay area. Billing is fast once you reach your turn. The mini restaurant in the back serves good, quick and tasty food. Recommend this place for a quick bite to-go order on busy days. The seated eating area is super dirty....DO NOT sit here and eat. Don't know how they pass health inspections.<//text>

Food is great but most employees do not follow rules when it comes to wearing masks properly. I went in to buy samosas and the guy who was serving the food was also in charge of the register machine, he was handling money and without washing his hands wanted to touch my food with his bare hands instead of using tongs. Simply disgusting.<//Review>

This is one the the most disgusting Indian grocery shop. Limited staff was wearing mask properly or at all. Totally no caution on following protocols by state n county.  When we walked out we were stopped by a mouse.  How is this business functioning. It's such a disgrace. Hopefully this message will get to owners to take action.</text>

Online ordering experience(for pick-up) : really bad. First and last. Will not be a repeat customer.
1) I drove for 1/2 hour to pick groceries - most of the items I ordered online were "not available". The reason I drove 1/2 hour is so that I can get these specific items, but they are not available. There should be way to update inventory on the online ordering platform if they are not available.
2)Ordered "Makki ki roti and sarson ka saag" from eatery nearby as a part of online order - but food was not good. Had much better tasting makki ki roti from other restaurants in the Bay Area.
3)Online order said pickup 6-8 pm and I got a call 3 hours in advance saying "Your order is ready". Why give a pick up time then if you don't stick to it?
4)Person who called me was not polite - he did not have good customer service skills apologizing for the inconvenience.
5) As other reviewers have mentioned, the place itself is very chaotic, unorganized, no social distancing and very casual use of masks.< /Text>

ok customer service for online order. for past few orders they did not deliver in given time window and would appreciate if we get replies to emails as they dont pick up the phone for online orders. I am going back to 2 star as they replaced the items even after saying "DO NOT SUBSTITUTE". Its not the first time this has happened. Its a waste of money.< /review>

<review>Online ordering is a total mess with Fremont branch.
They give wrong items and last time they missed a big item. After we called and mentioned this, they said that they will send it. its been 5 days and they didn't deliver the item or refund the cost of the item.
This is totally unacceptable.< /review></record>

<Review>Conventional Indian store - They carry fresh vegetables and Indian groceries, Reasonably priced. There is a kitchen inside serving fresh food. You can order for parties. I do all my shopping here for Indian goods. There is ample parking space in this complex. I see lot of Chinese and other Non-Indian communities shop here. Saturday Morning isa very good time to get fresh veggies from the shelf.</Review>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><review>Like it’s sister store in Sunnyvale, this is a great Indian store to get nearly all of your groceries/household supplies. Priced reasonably, I think it is the cheapest Indian store in the Bay Area. There’s ample parking available. There’s usually less rush here than it’s sister store. Even on weekends, it isn’t very busy here.

there is a fast food snack corner at the back of this store and the food here is delightful.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Text>Prices are marginally high but the store is spacious with a beauty parlour plus mini restaurant inside.

The way some people at the billing counter behave with customers is absolutely unacceptable. The way they roll their eyes at customers and the bad attitude is very disrespectful. Employ someone who knows the basics of dealing with customers.<//Review>

At this Indian grocery store there is Rasoi Express Vegetarian food restaurant...The food quality is amazingly fresh and superb with lots of Thali affordable options.

Only the sitting arrangements are not up to the mark....the restrooms are filthy and unclean...But because of delicious food I score this location 5/5 stars !!

Thanks again for freshly served Vegetarian food.< /text>

Extremely unhygienic. This store has a history of selling EXPIRED items. If you tell them, they will argue and harass with you. According to them, they aren't doing anything bad by selling expired items.<//Review>

You get Indian cooking items as well as tasty cooked food on the fast food bar. However,  things are not arranged in a proper pattern, eg: you get spices  and masalas in 2 different aisles which makes it difficult to search. Very cramped<//review>

The place is good and found few spices which I had difficulty finding in other stores.. Found it cheap than other stores. They have amazing restaurant inside and they serve great samasa and tea..

I would have surely given it 5 but the veggies are not kept properly and sometimes not fresh..< /text>

I am giving one star because they have not been fair with item returns. My husband bought ice cream but he did not bring the correct flavor. He went back right away, but India Cash N Carry did not take them back. I dont think that is fair. Its consumer's right to return items. Very bad.< /review>

There is a vegetarian take out on site and every thing smelled so good I regretted having lunch before shopping.  Walked out with a nice selection of beans lentils and snacks.

If you dig quality Vegetarian Indian grub then this is your SPOT!!! With an entire store of amazing food options, varieties of vegetables and brands that I’ve never heard of or seen before but need to experience type of things…after you’ve taken it all in…drag yourself into the back to their cafe style spot for a taste experience unlike many others!!!! I ask the staff for ideas and tell them what I like and usually am satiated beyond description with flavors and aromas bursting all around and upon my taste buds!!!< /text>

Only reason I visit this place is the availability of Indian groceries. There is nothing great to talk about. Staff are least interested in greeting you, other than asking if you need a bag. Some areas in the shop aren't very clean. I only buy raw/uncooked food here, never felt like buying the prepared ones, though they may taste good.</text>

OMG, the selection! They have their own extensive line of dals, many organic, very reasonable in 2# and larger quantities. Good produce. Very reasonable dairy, gelatin/etc free. A dhaba in the back -- didn't try, it smelled good. On a Friday after work they could have kept up cleaning better.  Great pickle selection. All quite reasonable really.</review>

Big Indian Supermarket. Very good quality produce at prices that mainstream markets won't match. Very attractive prices on high quality rice. Large packages of inexpensive spices that I use for Indian and other dishes. Row after row of packaged Indian foods that I've never seen before.</text>

Also there is a small restaurant kind of place with in this which serves Indian food. Not so clean but tastes good. You can find Indian vegetables as well here. Parking is enough outside. Not long queues for checkout, that's good. They have some free deliverythkng also but not very highlighted.</Text>< Pics>

Prices are misleading. Out of the ten items I purchased, 4 items were overcharged and when I asked why the prices were high they laughed at the fact. The description in the tags match the wrong branded items they put in front. Out of the many Indian stores in this area I really did not expect this. The last time I came a few items were expired and on the shelves and when I asked they said it’s not a big deal as items come from india and they just have to put expiry date for export reasons. I will not shop here again, I already was giving them the benefit of my doubt from my last visit.</Text>

I bought food here and the guy that rang me up was a little rude. They forgot to give me my cheese sandwich and when i sent my daughter to go get them, he looked at her like she was lying about receiving them.I also bought roti, it wasn't fresh. Curry was good though. Okay food, but the service could have been a lot friendlier.</text>

Bad service!! I wasted time when I went to your store but found out the item I needed was unavailable.  So I called  around 5:40pm on April 14 to make sure it's available before driving all the way to the store.  But they kept hanging up my calls!!<//review>

<review>Good selection of Indian Grocery at reasonable prices. Lot of fresh vegetable (again depends on the time of visit - could be a hit or miss). Weekend mornings are good to get the vegetables but unless it is early enough, there could be a crowd. Might not be able to find some of the rare items - unless multiple trips are made. The Rasoi Express @ the back of the store - is good for grabbing last minute dinner.<//review><resp>None</resp>< rate>

<Text>Pros: (1) Decent sized store, almost everything you need from an Indian store is available. (2) In-store restaurant, for a quick bite or take-out.
Cons: (1) Vegetables are not fresh, they wait  for even rotten stock to sell before they replenish. (2) Many items are priced higher in their system than the shelf price, so you need to be vigilant while billing. If you point out, the cashier will correct the price for your bill but will not correct the system price, so other unsuspecting customers will continue to pay the higher price.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Like to visit when I'm in Fremont to get my brand of Indian tea and other grocery items I need for Indian cooking. I also like their prepared food section with items to go and the ability to order some items to order to either take or eat there. They have some tables and chairs and a self serve drink station.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Google maps for this address takes you to the back of the street. Please correct it.

This place has become very expensive over time. I started shopping in a different store for Indian groceries and the saving around 20 to 30 percent.<//review>< response>

What I liked most about the store was CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have NEVER ever been to an Indian store across the country (and I have lived in NJ, CA, Dallas, MN etc.) where I've found them offering a "discount" on anything. I have never understood why Indian stores don't offer coupons/discounts like local stores here do. It's just bad business sense. However, these guys at India Cash and Carry not only offer a 5% discount on groceries (no exclusions) worth $55 and above, they also gave me a free bag when I told them I didn't have one and that I was new there. It was nice of them to understand my situation- their attitude would certainly make me want to come there more often and I will!<//Text>

<text>Its usually pretty crowded. They have lot of stuff but its always a mess. If you don't mind the crowd, noise and mess, this is the right grocery store because you will find what you will need. The only other good Indian grocery store that I've found in the area is Bharat Bazar which has less stuff but its not a mess. I usually visit that store because I find what I need there. In my experience both stores have fresh vegetables.< /text>< UserId.>

I have never been to this ICC for regular grocery but I went there to look for an utensil to make dosa.
I did find one easily here at the utensils section, which is entered from another door at one end of the store.
For other buyer's reference they sell a 33cm or 13 inch Futura Dosa Tawa here for around $38. That day, it was a life saver for me.<//Text>

<Text>Fresh and nice quality vegetables most of the times. They also serve fresh food and snacks daily. For many items the prices are lesser than other indian stores. Their frozen food section is a bit messy at times with broken and old packets of food.

But overall a good place for my weekly grocery needs.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Nice People, Fresh Veggies, Fresh Snacks. Store is little bit messy but compared to others, It is good. I have stayed in mostly all areas from San Jose to Fremont. There are two store I can go blindly based on my location. New India Bazaar at Main St, Milpitas and Cash and Carry Fremont. Sometimes, when I have big grocery list, even though I stay in fremont, I go to New India Bazaar. They are also having fresh stuffs. Always keen in restocking based on demand. overall, 5 Stars..</text><Name>Rajesh Patel</Name></record>

All the way to the back of this grocery store is a hidden gem, fresh delicious vegetarian Indian food that is incredibly good, delicious and fresh.

Our favorites are the Poori masala and their samosas, the prices are incredible too!!

On top of that you can find all kinds of super fresh vegetables and the endless aisles of pungent fresh spices are amazing.< /review>

<review>This is the best place to shop for indian goods. You name it and they probably have it! Indian snacks, healthcare, sweets, a mini restaurant, takeout place, vegetables, dairy products, and a lot more. Basically, if you cannot find what you're looking for here, then you won't find it in any other indian grocery. They prices are very reasonable and the best thing I love about this place is the authenticity of the indian food that they pack for take outs. Maybe twice or once a week, I always take out some indian food to satisfy my cravings. 😉 they also have a branch down in Mission boulevard on the way to Hayward but I'm not sure if it's operational.  The place is surrounded by amazing restaurants and fun places to spend time in. The position of the store is very convenient as well because it's just 5 minutes away from the highway exit. I forgot to mention that this area also had a few indian restaurants around it and also Afghan restaurants.  If you are hungry and looking for food, this just might be the area to fill up that empty stomach of yours. Hopefully this information will be helpful in making your decisions in the future.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Always check the receipt and match the items and price. I found mistakes in the invoice 90% of my visits. And I believe these mistakes are done purposely. While the store  has availability of plenty of items the indians need, you also get cheated in typical indian way. Check the price, weight and count items.< /review>

<Review>As any other Desi store. You find what you need unless it is yellow food color which they didn't have. Dirty store with customers that don't play their part in keeping the place clean.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Good Cafe inside. They make excellent roti, chapathi and chats. Decent prices in the grocery store. Vegetables are fine. Good selection of frozen ready to eat food etc. I like the cakes from Passage to India. The 3 stars are for disorganized store and strange checkout where people have to block and stand in one of the aisles and wait to be called. I prefer Bharat Bazaar unless in need Roti/Chapathi or I am shopping at Costco,< /review>< name>

A 5star rating... We will get everything from food to vegetables, atta to oil, roti to dals...what not everything.. The guys who tells that he doesnt like may have visited when he was frustrated.... Ask the guys who dont have a indian grocery store at their location..We should be thankful to the owners.. By far the best store in BayArea...< /Review>

Dirty and  Cold ( no heater the entire shop) ill trained / rude shop staff who have no clue on how to behave with customers ( one lady said in Punjabi ? These people learn 4 lines in India and teach us about quality , or telling us go check if the heater ourself when we said it was not working , and the sheer body language , clearly showing lack of proper education ) ,  , staff has no idea on pricing , and food is ok but you need to be careful to avoid hygiene issues,it's a shame that such shops exist to tarnish name of Indian community , Dont visit until unless you have no other options, there are plenty around, hope management reads this and try to overhaul a place which could be soon visited by California Health department if they don't do so</text>

<Review>Went here for the 1st time recently. They have a great variety of Indian groceries & fresh vegetables. They also have a vegetarian chaat cafe in the back - with Indians street food, snacks, sweets & a good selection of ready made hot food that you can eat there or take home. The prices were reasonable. My wife & I had pani puri & dehi papaadi chaat & it was very good.< /Review>< Resp>

You can get almost all the Indian grocery items in descent price. They have a discount on a lot of items. I usually go to this store once  in a week and stock all the items i need. On weekends it gets a little crowded. So avoid going on weekends as much as possible.< /review>
