It isn't glamorous, but to me the Costco food court has a certain kind of decadent, late capitalist beauty that you just can't get anywhere else. The prices are right, the portions are beyond healthy, it's really just fun for the whole family. 5/5 recommend.<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Reasonable service, great pricing. Limited food menu (pizza 🍕 and hot dogs 🌭 only) due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

Note: As of April 6th, 2020:  YOU MUST HAVE A COSTCO MEMBERSHIP CARD FOR SERVICE! Not a member? Just ask someone in queue who is to allow the cashier to scan their card and you're in!

Soft drinks are still just $0.59 with free refills, but you must get a new cup from the cashier now.

Overall, a good value and decent food... hope the chicken bake, chili and hot turkey sandwich come back soon!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Sadly has condensed menu by excluding items that were previously enjoyed by many or having the extra options was something that made going that much more enjoyable after shopping. Quite a few tourists also come to sample their offerings. Probably one of the most inexpensive places near the beach or if you prefer In N Out Burgers is a short 150 yard stroll away in the same parking lot.

<review>Very creative line up of fish and chicken and the fruit and vegetables are tops and fairly priced. I have never been disappointed here. And, I'm healthier as a result. Very good company with weekly sales on something you will need and want in your home. Prices are very fair and quality beats every chain except Trader Joe's, which I see as a tie.< /review>< Pictures>

I like the 100% beef hot dogs. And the yogurt fresh & smooth. Large pepperoni pizza with red pepper & parm cheese goodness in the food court.

They have chicken bakes, sandwiches and Pizza also frozen yogurt and shakes. The turkey salad is also Very Good. You can also get take out Pizza but It sometime the service is very slow if you go during busy times especially holidays, there is a call ahead number you can order but I have still had to wait for a while.  If you are going to Costco and have the Munchies its an inexpensive way to feed the family.</text><Name>Albert Pena</Name><Time>1535492997233< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba8c4476f9ff:0x690d6c49c1d874ce<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Cheap..cheap...cheap. Best value and no membership needed at the food court. Where else can you get hotdogs with unlimited fountain drink sodas for $1.50. Okay,  it's 1.63 because Uncle Sam also wants a piece of the bite. If you don't like hotdogs, there's pizza, chicken rolls etc.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Pretty busy costco but this one takes the cake.  Some people who come here don't know how to park or are super slow and you end up loosing a parking spot. Long lines for gas station which makes it unbearable to pump gas. Too many people in marina del rey lately.< /Text></record>

The food is not very tasty. It doesn't cost anything, but that's because it's subpar.<//Text>

<Text>Staff is so slow. It took me 1.5 hour wait time to sit on chair to give blood sample. I guess they are a lot short of staff. Receptionist are very confused wrt health insurance. I generally prefer lapcorp Tustin which is way much better than this. Extremely bad experience.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Very unprofessional and rude!!!! The front desk girl barely said hi to me and acted so busy and not interested with me coming in but eventually pointed me towards the check in  window. After i checked in she had me sign some paperwork and didn't even mention that I am okay to seat down and wait until my name is called. After i was called in the room I noticed previous patient paperwork still in the room. Not sure if they ever heard of HIPPA???? and since there was other patient paperwork in the room it made me question if the room was even prepared for me to begin with (wiped, disinfected). So when the women that supposed to take my blood came in and I raised my concerns she acted confused and  went out the room to talk to other employees about what is happening. Then when i asked if the  room was even wiped she asked me to go wait in the waiting room while she wipe the room.. INFECTION CONTROL is definitely lacking in that office from what I have observed . After i went back into the waiting room I started to question myself if its a good idea for me to have my blood drawn in this facility. And instead of acting apologetic or trying to make me feel more comfortable I heard them laughing behind the close doors. Or course I had to cancel my appointment and ran out of there.< /Text>

Chairs were set within just 2-3 feet of each other and the individuals were standing much too closely. Hand sanitizer for patient use was nowhere to be found and the containers I found in the blood collection rooms were empty. Furthermore, the staff was extremely cold when I attempted to make small conversation or ask about my procedure. I was either ignored or granted one-two word answers in response. Ultimately, my review of this clinic is the first negative review of a facility I have ever written in my life. Not only was the clinic's adherence to COVID policies shockingly lacking, the staff lacked cordiality and professionalism. Such a location strongly demands review.</text></record>

<text>I just spent 40 minutes driving around to different lab corps because none of your hours are correct online. They are posted on the door with handwritten notes. I tried to call and was unable to get anyone, multiple times today. I am very disappointed in the lack of professionalism. LabCorp sets a seriously low bar for patient experience but knows you will keep coming because it is mandated by their contracts with the health system. Disappointing.< /text>< GmapID>

BAD customer service！I have a high deductible plan this year, so I wanted to pay cash at first. The reception told me I only need to pay $11 with insurance. I double confirmed the price and paid right over there. Yesterday, I received another billing, said I have outstanding. I called their customer service, their attitude is supppppper rude！！！I only wanted to tell them not to suggest customer the price if you are not sure. The representative kept saying I signed a document said it's an estimated price. Then your stuff shouldn't tell me that's all I need to pay at the first place, right？I told her you should tell your employee to pay attention, she said it's not her job. Excuse me？？？ She asked me to call this lab to complain by myself. What's the hack？？？</text>

Inexperienced for kids, go to quest.
I repeat do not go here with your kids, ask your doc to change, pay a little more if you are not covered, go to quest.

I've always been to labcorp in NJ,.
However, my doctors here have recommended quest. I never liked to go there, as it's always crowded.

But let me tell you, they have more experience.

This morning I had been to labcorp as my son's doc sent me there. The nurse had said that they are trained to draw blood from kids.
My 4 YO son wasn't aware of anything on the test, I was ready with the puzzle on my phone. Everything was going smooth, but heck there was an inexperienced guy who was assigned to draw blood, he not only poked hard he wiggled and twisted the needle after the needle was in, he couldn't find the vein. He continues to look for the vein by tilting and moving the needle, I and to tell him to stop while my son began "ouch ouch". In the beginning, I had to tell him I can't do this alone, only then he called the cold face front office lady.

By then my 4YO was in great pain. And this front office  lady who was helping, what a robotic person, can't they talk to kids, don't they know what to say. Idiot's went for the left hand and my son began to resist, I had to hold him hard, and the lady too had to hold. What a waste of my insurance money, I just let my child be a Guinea pig.

Can't you talk to a child who you with your inexperience made him go through a traumatic experience.
Boo to labcorp attendants here.< /Text>

Unprofessional, 2nd rate operation.
Not a World Class buisness at all.
Waited 1-1/2 hours for a simple blood draw and still nothing. I was told to wait longer so I just left.  No sense of urgency.  I was told that they welcome walk-ins but fail to tell you there is a horrible wait!  Poorly managed facility.  When you are fasting and hungry, you don't want to hear that you need to wait longer. I am letting my Doctor and health group know this is a ridiculous operation to deal with, I want someone else to deal with going forward.  Horrible Customer Service.<//review>

<Text>There are so many things wrong with this place. Sit back, this is gonna be a long one.. First off I arrived before they opened and there was 11 people in front of me, which okay, i should've gone sooner. After we all went in and got checked in, one nurse was helping gather peoples paper work and a guy nurse i believe his name was Alejandro, sat there and bossed her around. He was extremely rude to her, You can 100% tell he is either not a morning person or not a peoples person. I do HR at my job and his attitude towards clients and co workers would be unacceptable. He didn't smile, he didn't help get people checked in, didn't help with paperwork, he just sat there and made rude comments. The wait was extremely long, they had 1 nurse drawing blood for at least an hour. Eventually things started speeding up after another employee came in around 8am. The nurse that was drawing blood, seemed extremely confused. She was asking a lot of questions, which im not against but it made me feel scared like she didn't know what she was doing. Well once I finally got called back, she kept looking over my paper work and you could tell, she didn't know what to do. She grabbed my paperwork and left the room, came back a few minutes later and said "oooohhh now i know" which made me feel like "ughh shouldn't you have known to begin with?" Well anyways, after she got the needle in, she did not release the rubber band from my arm and was trying to make my blood come out with it still on there. She applied so much pressure that it was hurting me. Once we were done, she took the needle out and then took the rubber band off which made me bleed a lot. My arm is extremely sore. To top it all off, she barely spoke English, and that doesn't bother me but i had to say "im sorry, repeat" after everything she asked me and it made me feel rude and that wasn't my intention. This was definitely not the best experience, nor will I ever come back to this location. I read the reviews prior to coming and I should've listened, but instead I was trying to save time by going to the closest one to me.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcddaff1ed600d:0xb1c0b0b71882e77a</GmapID>< pictures>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I was a former employee of LabCorp. I loved Labcorp prior to 2018. (different management) I worked here as a phlebotomist each employee worked extremely hard. We're short staffed. When you communicate that to office manager she tells you "work faster." "Figure out another method"  She said and did so many things including violating HIPPA. She pops in when she feels like it, Or when a patient screams and calls her she drives over to the office blames you and says you need to be retrained. The manager never had anything positive to say. I met a lot of nice patients who witnessed things themselves and felt sorry for us. If I was a patient coming into be drawn I understand how it can be frustrating.  Just know that everyone working at this Irvine Brarranca site works very hard and goes as fast as they can. I would recommend filling out a complaint card and mailing them yourselves to the corporate office. Let them know your wait times and that only one person is drawing. Dont talk to the manager its pointless. She tells you what you want to hear and then nothing changes. Not even for the employees.</Text>< Pics>

I have tried Irvine Lab corp 3 times. Always the same. Just a drop off took 8 minutes. Never got in for blood work because wait was to long. Thos morning over an hour. I could drive in traffic to Tustin location and be back in Irvine before people that I saw there had been taken care of. I stopped back one time to see if any of the same people were still there. Some were still waiting. Never more than a 5 to 10 minute wait at Tustin location. They are doing something right there.< /text>

Crowded. Take long time to process. No standing in line concept. People coming in late, just jump in. Reception is awful. Need to learn courtesy.</Review>

Moved to 113 Waterworks Way. Super annoying that this entry is still here. LabCorp hasn't even updated their website, even tho its pretty clear they knew the lease would be ending and should've fixed this a while ago.<//Review>

Ordered Boba shaved ice and got a chocolate slushie instead.

All the ice is melted and there's too much whatever this is.

At least the toppings and flan was good< /text>

Very unsatisfied. Ordered through a delivery app. I specified that I wanted the milk tea to be NO Ice as my stomach was not feeling well and I wanted something warm, but they still put big chunks of ice cubes in my order regardless of my notes. It’s ridiculous that I  had to take out the ice cubes one by one myself with a spoon! Order from another store if you can. Not recommending this specific location!!< /Review>

<Text>Went to this place when it first opened and it was great. Ended up going back to Fantasia because it is faster and has better boba. Their tea is great, but I prefer the black balls that come from the other store right across the street. They take much longer than Fantasia to produce their drinks. They did mess up my order, which was fixed.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
{'time': 1626972113429, 'text': "Hi Tommy,\n\nThanks for visiting Meet Fresh and for taking the time to leave us a review and rating. Glad to hear we were able to make your order right for you. We are a bit understaffed at this location currently and as a result, it can lead to longer wait times.

The girl who takes order there is rude......not polite at all. She speaks with the attitude like “you can eat or go...  don’t bother me”. She does not even want take any customer questions...I like go to meet fresh in bay area. But I do NOT recommend anyone go in this particular store.< /review>

<time>1624334102192<//time><text>This location has incompetent staff. We have visited this location out of convenience twice, but we left both times unhappy and unsatisfied.

First time order took a long time for simple drinks, and they tasted very bad. The tea had a bitter taste from sitting there so long.

Second time we ordered one item off the desert menu and it took more than 40 minutes. The order they called for us was not our order. Our order was completed 30 minutes prior but the staff cannot read their own ticket when shown and asked during this wait time multiple times. Order was also wrong. Instead of remaking it they offered a substitute and made it seem like they were doing us a favor.< /text><Rating>1< /Rating></record></dataset><record>
< review>
I came with friends, and we ordered Ube teas, one waffle, and one other snack item. I went to counter to ask if they had plastic forks or a knife, and the girl’s response was “for what?” I explained that we were just trying to cut and share the waffle. She then replied “Can’t you just use your hands?”. I was a little shocked by this response given that I explained we were just trying to be covid cautious. They had hand sanitizer everywhere, but I hope they realize that not everyone wants to eat with their hands. Alternatively, a simple “sorry, we don’t” would have also worked< /review>

This store is much worse than another meet fresh store. Service is really slow. Food is not good. I ordered red bean soup today and it taste and smell burnt. The taro chuck is bad pick, not starchy but crunchy. Taro paste is not smooth at all and from bad pick of taro. I would rather drive 20m to Cupertino than here.
More detail. Throw up later last night</text>

I really love how you can walk up to a touch screen and make your order to your like plus add add-ons. My drink was ready super fast, they have a super cute inside with some limited booths to sit in. They have menus everywhere and above the registers they have all their new or seasonal drinks or specials. They have a rewards program and QR codes and such to add their social media. My drink was perfect, they let you modify it how you want at the standing touch screen menus. They have so many drink options and desserts/ snacks to try.

Very unorganized.  Staff not friendly at all, bordering on abrupt and rude.
Placed order and was given a beeper.
After watching many other people get their orders (folks who ordered after us), I finally walked back up to the counter to inquire.
Turns out our order had been sitting there for quite a while (becoming non-Fresh).  Turns out they gave us a beeper (#19), when the receipt showed beeper #10 (gave us wrong beeper!).
No apologies at all, no smiles.
Terrible service, and no organization!<//Review>

This is the experience I got AFTER giving them tips in the mobile order.<//Text>< date>

We do online order several times to pick up, but they are always delay our order or even cannot find the order. It’s ridiculous! We always need to wait for another 20min to get the order... And they make the incorrect meal for 2 times... I will say, to save time,  I won’t visit anymore!!!< /Review>

Very bad experience. I have been a fan of meet fresh and I always order the same one (hot taro ball 4 substituting pearl with barley) for years!!!! But this particular meet fresh told me they DONT do it, I can only order customized red bean soup. Okay, extra effort and also cost than the regular order, and I came home only to find out no taro ball in it(even after I confirmed with the staff onsite), such a disappointment!!!! Even it’s only five minutes drive, I would never go back. Bad service and experience over all. Not mentioning the wait time. :(</text>

Stopped by for some boba and almond soup and it took more than 45 mins waiting before they told us that they were out of boba. Had asked several times before that and they kept saying 'its cooking' and '3 more minutes' and tried to tell me they didn't receive my order until 15 mins after I placed it, but they were reading the computer wrong. It was telling them that was the time they were supposed to have it ready to pick up. I hope the service gets better. We will go elsewhere for now.< /review>

Awful service and bad quality

This is my first time to order in Santa Clara meetfresh. However, I feel really disappoint because the quality is TOTALLY worse than Cupertino meet fresh, and the service is really bad.

I ordered Barley tofu pudding and Mung Bean tofu pudding, however I feel like I ordered a tofu pudding with sugar water. I just found A FEW barley and A FEW Mung bean.  If i want to have tofu pudding as my dessert again, I would rather choose to driver to Cupertino to order meet fresh to have a REAL barley tofu pudding. I will never back to Santa Clara meetfresh again.<//review>

The milk teas were amazing. The tea was perfectly brewed and the boba was a great texture. If you don't like very sweet desserts the sesame mochi is for you.  All of the mochi was soft and delicious. The toasted coconut on the Q-mochi combo added a great depth of flavor. The carmel pudding was sweet and silky. We will definitely make thier our weekly treat!< /text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is very convenient to order food with the app, and you can pick up the food in one click. I opened it in the car and found that I had made a mistake, because I really didn't like to eat red beans and took it back to tell the clerk. The clerk had a very good attitude and helped me make the right meal. Thank you very much for my little sister, who will come often in the future!

(Original)
用app點餐很方便，一下就可以取餐了。到車上打開來吃發現做錯了，因為實在不喜歡吃紅豆拿回去跟店員講，店員態度非常好的又幫我做了正確的餐點。很感謝店員小姊姊，以後會常來！< /text>

Aladdin never fails to amaze me.  $50,000 bond got our family member out for $500 and a payment plan.  Literally called 9 other bondsman companies and none even came close! Kerry went above and beyond!! If you find yourself or loved one in jail call Aladdin! It's like having a genie in a bottle!!<//Text>

We had been working with another bail bonds company and after getting nowhere with them, Kerry came to the rescue. Once we spoke on the phone, it was clear how professional and how seriously Kerry takes her job. Communication was incredible, we never had to follow up with any questions because Kerry kept in constant contact with our family, she kept in touch to see how we were doing with all the information we needed to gather, which helped take stress from the situation. The bail was for 500k and all the bail bonds companies told us this would require a house as collateral to get the bond approved, however Kerry and the manager Edward fought for us with the insurance company and somehow were able to get us the bond without collateral, we could not believe it when they gave us the good news. They are truly the best.The entire office is so amazing, incredibly professional, excellent communication, helpful and kind and our family is extremely grateful for their help. Thank you Kerry, you are amazing!!< /review>< user_id>

This place is actually the only place that will take pretty much any amount as the minimum. The rest of the 10% is billed to you. And your loved one still gets released.</text>

I finally called Aladdin and sasha my bail agent happened to answer and she was very kind and understanding. My husband's bail was 100,000 I didn't think that they would help me because I only had $1,300. Sasha made it work, and she also got me very low payments. She was very quick and efficient. Very kind and most important understanding of the situation. The whole process took less than 30 minutes and she explained all the terms and answered all my questions. She posted his bail in 15 minutes. Thank you very much Aladdin. And to Sasha. I will definitely use them in future if I needed to again.</review><time>1572050166351< /time><Gmap_id>0x80c365cf2f9da401:0xaae17558de1ffce</Gmap_id>< Response>

Greeted by Kerry who answered the phone. Treated me with respect and very helpful with my situation. Arrangements were made very quickly to speed up my release. The next day I went into the office and was helped with the necessary paperwork by Michy, also very friendly and helpful. I've read the other reviews. All I can say is that in my case I was treated very well by everyone.</text>

First time going through the whole bailing someone out proccess and they made it really easy and helped me with everything. The very nice lady Kerry was beyond helpful and very compassionate, she really made the process easy and broke everything down into detail. Hoping to never have to  go through this again but if I do I will definitely go back to Aladdin!!! I reccomend 1,000%< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience here, I was so new at this and didn’t know what to do especially because I was panicking on how to get my fiancé out.. The lady Michy has the best customer service and will do anything in her power to help calm you down and help you as much as she can.. Very helpful and thankful for this place. Great rates as well to help you get your loved ones out.. definitely recommend going to Michy for any help<//Review>

<text>A really amazing Texas style BBQ joint in East Los?! Oh yeah!

I'm a fan of delicious meats served up big. This family owned and ran business did not disappoint in portion or in how incredible everything was. I can tell there's a lot of love that they put into this place. From the food to the quite and laid back vibe, I enjoyed. Got the Pit Master Combo that's good enough to share or gorge on your own. It comes with a pork rib, chicken, Angus beef brisket, and a pull pork slider plus a choice of a side (went with the coleslaw).The brisket was nicely prepared, tender and juicy. It was my favorite on this huge plate. For the chicken they use leg and thigh. I could taste the smokiness from the skin on through to the meat. Pull pork is Texas size slider. They stuffed that bread with plenty of BBQ'd shredded meat. Just the sauces themselves shows that they are experts on how Texas BBQ (aside from their meat smoking skills) should taste. Excellent bold combinations of smoky, spicy and sweet. But not to overpower the amazing smoked flavors of the meats cause just a drizzle is all you're gonna really need.

A definite recommendation for anyone, from anywhere, wanting yummy Texas BBQ in SoCal.  One of the best I've had in this state. I say skip the corporate chain Lucille's and taste what truly is good ... in the hood ;) and support this wonderful, local, family owned gem. Double win.< /text>< userid>

<Review>I am happy that we finally found this cute, comfortable couch cafe in south Scottsdale.   It can easily be missed in this nonchalant strip mall.  Mmmmmmm.  Their lavender latte tasted unique with the help of locally sourced beans.   I was delightfully surprised ...<//Review><response>None</response>< Name>

Cobbler is a plus when they have it. My 4th time here and the flavors are consistent every time 😋
Nice to see a bbq joint in the inner city..especially on Whittier which us loaded with taco trucks at every corner!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzQTYmai0n6oNWzMCHcdZChsuT7HBC4DWR3JoG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNipVZnx7Q7sBS-aHSXUdnG5Tob0GGbyEMsFAI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>I'm sorry but this is not Texas style bbq adding liquid smoke does not make it SMOKED!! The Mac I had was just bland over cooked. To be fair I did try the ribs and chicken and brisket also the pulled pork and it was ok but not good.</Text></record></dataset><record>

We enjoy eating out. Last night we  found this fine restaurant which friends told us about. We passed a delightful evening there with fine cooking and a nice crew and a great  cuisine. We put this venue in our phone list  and we will definitely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.<//text>

Great tasting BBQ, quick services and very fair prices.  I went with the combo that had chicken, beef brisket a rib and a side of loaded mash potatoes.  The potatoes were amazing.  I couldn't even everything in one sitting. The only downside is the parking as you'll have to find something on the street. This place is cash only so come prepared.<//text>

<Review>we ordered the brisket sandwich that came with one side (we got potato salad) and sample plate that had two ribs, brisket and a pulled pork sandwich with one side (we got mac and cheese). the meat was tender for the ribs and brisket, but I did not care for the flavor of the barbque sauce. pulled pork sandwhich was really greasy it soaked through the bread and ran down my fingers as I tried to eat it. the brisket sandwhich was ok, it was just the meat, bread and sauce. overall this seemed like authentic cowboy style barque. nothing fancy.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2cf402a32f3d1:0xfad96d4a1a681dfa<//Gmap_id>< resp>

THE BEST BBQ IN LA ! ! !
HUGE Portions, amazing meat and quality foods.
Little hole in the wall with no line or wait.
everything falls off the bone and tastes like your in the heart of Texas while in southern california. I eat BBQ a LOT! And this is hands down one of my 2 favorite spots on this earth now. I WILL BE BACK FOR SURE.
Easy 5/5 No questions asked.< /review>

< Review>
I been traveling miles and I mean miles for good Barbecue. I travel because East LA does not and has not had good BBQ. But I was wrong, for the last 6 years this small mom and pop joint has been making fantastic BBQ. I was skeptical when I walked in today, the owner gave ne a sample of the pulled pork with his slaw while I waited for our order. I fell in love with it from the first bite, it taste even better than it smells.
I can not praise the food enough, remember it is cash only and is cosy for a small group. Large groups best get it to go.
If ypu get pulled pork make sure you get the slaw, pairs perfect together. Sweet slaw balances the tangy bbq. Brisket is ridiculously delicious. And ribs are tender and perfectly done. I will let know about the chicken when I have room to try it.

I hope they blow up so they stay in business,  but hope not to big because I would hate to stand in line for an hour to get my food.</Review>

Went here for the first time! I'm glad I didn't have to wait in line! The food was super yummy and the cornbread was amazing! I got the kid's meal and even that was way too much for me, but it was reasonably priced. Over all, good place to go!< /Text>

< Review>
Quite amazing BBQ in LA, my mom thinks it may be the best brisket we ever had.

It's a little place on Whittier and there is some free 1 hour parking on the street outside. The two owners are great to talk to and oh so friendly. We ordered 3 plates and 2 sodas and didn't reach $40.
The brisket was delicious (so much so that we ordered some more to go for later), not overly sauced, and the meat really shone through. Smoked chicken was juicy and flavourful, the ribs were meaty and the pulled pork (although listed as a slider, it's a sandwich in it's own right) was great - the meat was pulled but not stringy or too wet. Sides of macaroni salad and coleslaw were good, but the jalapeno corn bread was the item to go for (apparently not available on all days, so try your luck).
The man behind the counter was kind enough to make a hot green tea for my mum, not on the menu but from his private stash. Service like that, coupled with the food we got, makes this a place I wish I had heard about sooner. It's a 25 min drive from Los Feliz where we were staying but this was definitely worth it!< /Review>

Very good cuts of meat. BBQ sauce is yummy and portions and price are just right! I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because Mondays are my days off and they are closed Mondays and close by 5 every other day. That's pretty early for me. And cash only is a bit of a pain for me.. but most other people won't care much because there are 3 different banks nearby</Text>

My friends liked it, but I'm absolutely not a fan of it. I love bbq, but I didn't like this restaurant.
I didn't liked the atmosphere at all. It looked very cheap. Service was not so bad.
But I cleaned the table and the chair with baby wipes, when I was almost done, the waitress came over and wiped it again with a dirty rag<//review>

I am not a BBQ person what so ever my friend brought me here and I just picked what I normally get st these places due to the fact I'm not much a fan I always get something close enough to what I like...so I got the brisket beef sandwich loaded potatoes and a Mac n cheese side....this sandwich had made my entire god dam week! I've walked this Earth 30 years and I've never had bbq this good in my life. I can't wait to bring my girlfriend back and any one else I can bring so I have a reason to come back and share the love with....the Mac and cheese is on a level I can only explain as this is the stuff they serve to only rich white people lol....and the loaded potatoes just the same Fing amazing. I will be coming back any chance I get. Thank you for showing me how bbq should taste</Review>

< review>
Ok so I've been saying for years look out when East LA gets a good BBQ spot it's gonna blow up! Except this place however has yet to blow and for reasons I really can't explain. So here's my first experience the owner goes over the menu with me in detail simple, but he explains it to me with such passion. I get excited as he he sets the bar really high!

That said it takes allot for me to write a review just moments after I visit an establishment. In this case however it's a must. My order was to go the first thing I tried was the pulled pork sandwich which the owner recommended. Wow I gotta say not a pulled pork fan, but this guy got it right for some reason it's delicious! The potato wedges.... Well I'll pass in the future wasted real estate in my opinion. Other than that this place is a winner potato salad cooked to perfection Baked Beans ..... Decent!!

Now for all the money people lets talk about the ribs. I've tried many throughout my days and these are at least in my top five. Smokey, fall off the bone tender, with great sauce. So come out and support this little gem in East Los You'll be glad you did trust me 4 1/2 stars!!<//review>

Really good.The bbq sauce was tangy and sweet.the potato wedges are amazing, crispy outside. The pulled pork was sweet with a hint if heat. The beef ribs are the best. To film to eat the chicken, took it home for later.<//text>

Sooo, this venue came to my job and I have to honestly say the food was nasty. The worst barbecue I have ever eaten. I ordered the brisket sandwich and the meat was to thick, to fatty and kind of tough. Very disappointed that I waisted my money. The sauce was not that great either. I should of just followed my first mind and ate the tuna I brought for lunch<//Text>

This is what i and some other people describe as a hole in the wall because if you sneeze as you drive by you'll miss it its a small place with a HUGE TASTE and it's so inexpensive your family and friends will enjoy it make it a family fun time at MEMES LITTLE TASTE OF TEXAS in east L.A. THE FAMILY OWN BUSINESS ARE SO ATTENTIVE SUPER FRIENDLY....

Oh My God! The Ribs are the BEST! Chicken falls right off the bone. Most tender brisket Ever. You must try this place if you like BBQ. Too bad they close early and only take Cash. Hope the survive and strive.<//Review>

Really like coming here and can recommend it highly!!! Newly remodeled with all new chairs and a very pleasant atmosphere. Great and always friendly service. And I like that there is low turnover. So you don't have a new nail technician every time you go.
Check them out!<//Text>

I got the acrylic full set, pedicure and eye brow wax and was very happy with the quality. This place seemed very popular since there were many people coming in and out. There also seemed to be a lot of ladies who were regulars (always a good sign). They were very fast, efficient and very friendly. The place looked clean and new. They also offered drinks and wine to their customers. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for friendly and good quality place for nails. I will come here again next time I'm in town. (smiley)❤️< /text>

<review>I am a healthcare professional so I am very picky when it comes to nail salons. Everything Nails  impressed me with the infection control protocols I was able to observe.
- they autoclave their tools
- their nail file/ buffer are 1 time use (I was given mine to take home)
- the salon as a whole was very organized and neat
I had a very good first experience and will definitely be going back.< /review>< Pics>

@@@This was my first pedicure, and I was really worried about the whole unsanitary not sterilized utensils.. but they were very clean and the lady even opened new package! She also handed me a water bottle and adjusted the massage chair.  for the pedicure was very much worth it thank you for taking your time and the superb service!@@@< /Review>

I cannot give higher regards to the Glenn Dental staff. My whole experience thus far has been truly wonderful. I used to fear the dentist. And now I genuinely look forward to my appointments here. Dr Joy, Lily, Mathew, and the whole staff have been awesome. It’s a great environment. I feel in good hands here. Thanks Glenn Dental team.<//Text>

<review>I have been going to Glenn Dental for the past year and have had an amazing experience.  Dr. Joy was very easy going and very pleasant to work with.  The staff has gone out of their way to make me feel comfortable and at ease.  Special thanks to my hygienist Amanda and also to Jennifer Beach for always taking the time to say hello.< /review>< gmapID>

Best dentist in the high desert. Recently went in for a root canal that was long overdue. Dr. Joy was amazing! She explained every step she was doing and the best part was I didn’t feel a thing! Staff is always friendly no matter who I’ve dealt with. They also have some of the newest high tech equipment. If you’re looking for a dentist in the high desert, this is the only place you should trust your teeth to!< /text>

I've been going to Glenn Dental for about 8 years. The staff has always been great and Dr. Glenn and Dr. Joy are always so gentle and pleasant. The front office is calming and you don't feel you're at the dentist. The back areas where the dental work is done are always very clean and all their equipment and tools always look to be up to date with technology. I used to have a phobia of dentist,  but they've been so great at Glenn Dental, that it doesn't really affect me anymore.<//Text>

The very best dentist I have ever seen and I am 64 years old. I didn’t even know you could have a dental procedure done pain free with just novacane. So clean, thoughtful, honest and on time. Love these guys wish they were up north so my son could see them.< /Review>

<Review>Amazing and wonderful staff! Glenn dental is the Planet Fitness of the dental world. A judgement free zone, where you can go and work on your smile. Dr. Joy is literally a joy. She was patient about my fears and corrected years of dental neglect in my very first visit. I would highly recommend this office to anyone; however, if you have been too embarrassed to go to the dentist... this is the place for you!!! Thank you Dr.Joy and your amazing assistant! 😁😁😁<//Review>< Date>

The office is beautiful, the dentists and dental hygienists are awesome and they don't try to cheat you and over charge you.  They have always tried to squeeze me into their busy schedule when I am in town which is very much appreciated.  Highly recommend them to every one.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<time>1565978252338<//time><rating>5</rating><Text>I had a major fear of going to the dentist my entire life however, Dr.Glenn and his team have completely changed my view of dentists and their practice. The team at Glenn dental are incredible and are ready to go to every length possible to make sure they run the best practice in the desert. One thing that dissuaded me at first was that every reviewer said they were more expensive than most dentist offices but I went all over SoCal and found that their prices are the average and yet they still deliver above average 11/10 service. Dr.Glenn and his team helped me get my confidence back and there was not a single time after having a root canal, a deep cleaning and having another invasive procedure done that I left sore or that they didnt have my best interest as their end goal. Thank you Dr.Glenn and thank you to your amazing team, I appreciate you guys and your hospitality so much.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>If you're looking for the best dentist office in Apple Valley, CA look no further than Dr. Glenn. He and his staff are kind, professional, caring and careful. They are always friendly and seem genuinely happy to see you. The work is always first rate. I've never had to wait for an appointment - a very unusual situation for a doctor's office. I highly recommend Glenn Dentistry.</review><UserId.>102974493015697510331< /UserId.>< Pictures>

I was terrified of the dentist.  I had a horrible experience 4 years ago.  Every time I thought about a dentist, my hands would start to sweat.  I broke a molar on Monday. I decided I would just live with the pain, but I couldn’t. It was too much.  I started searching reviews to find a caring and compassionate dentist that was highly qualified.  Dr. Glenn completely lived up to his reputation. I finally have found a dentist I can trust. I promise.  He’s the best!</Text>

Dr. Glenn and his staff are THE best. I am new to Apple Valley after 40 years in San Diego.
I researched dentists online and he had all positive reviews. And I’m not talking about two or three ... he had about 45 glowing comments.
I went to his office a few weeks ago for a consult and he was able to do a filling same appointment. He saved my natural tooth that had a lumineer. Flawless and excellent work; truly a cosmetic and caring dentist. He listens to what his patients want.
The appointment process was easy to schedule over the phone . I filled out my medical history on a touch screen in their reception area. Everyone was so professional and polite.
The office was immaculate and comfortable. His fees are reasonable, too. You can’t find anything better in every respect.
Thank you Dr. Glenn and entire staff! You made my day, my month. I have found my jewel in this high desert.</Text>

<review>My experiance was  excellent at Glen Dental!  I Checked in sat down and was called back in less then 5 minutes. Tara double checked my health history and took  X-rays quickly. She was kind ,gentle and informative about what toothpaste to use and some advise on how to clean and brush better. She was very personable and pleasant. Dr Glenn came in right after she let him know I was all clean and ready for my examination. He gave me the okay and I was on my way. I love this Dental Office.

<user_name>Luci Walton</user_name><Text>Customer service is above and beyond at this dental practice - from the front desk to the practitioners - everyone is very friendly and helpful. Dental services are conducted in a timely manner and procedures are explained very clearly prior to taking place. Once the service is completed, the technician will make your next appointment then walk you back to the front desk for check out. Service runs smoothly at Glenn Dental and that is a great benefit for their clients. I highly recommend this office.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1528918516525, 'text': 'Thank you Luci!

I am happy to say that my five members of my family and me have been patients of Glen Dental for about five years now.  Everytime I come in for a visit I am  cordially welcomed with a nice smile from the staff and the doctors themself. Overall, my family and me always have positive experiences. Short waiting times do to a great coordination of the staff. I highly recommend Glen Dental to everyone.<//Text>

Best dentist ever. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to the dentist and they make me feel so relaxed. They talk to me like a person and not a contributor to their checks. I absolutely LOVE them and I'll never go anywhere else.< /text>

<Text>I called on a Friday at 4:15pm. My temporary veneer came off a front tooth. They said come in & they'd cement it back in. My permanent cap had already come in  but i was waiting for my  scheduled appointment the following week. Dr Joy was up to making my smile good again with the permanent Luminere not the temporary. Yeah! I left my house at 4:30 and arrived back home by 5:30pm on a Friday, with my permanent Luminere. Thanks Dr Joy and Dr Glenns peeps that gave me back my smile on such short notice. You Rock!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Like most real men, I just don't like going to the dentist.  Nor do I go regularly like women do. I had to go due to broken tooth  and root canal needed and was worked on by Dr. Joy.  Dr. Joy gave me two shots of whiskey (to numb my mouth) then put her knee on my chest  and grabbed a pair of needle nosed pliers and channel locks and started working on my tooth! (ok guys just funin-burp).  After Dr. Joy did the root canal work and temp molding for a crown, I walked out of there thinking of my first experience here.  I can truly say that my experience for the above work was "pleasant."  Now, who can say that after major dental work!  Just left from my second visit to have the crown put in.  Once seated, the assistant did a few things like taking x-rays, removing the temp filling, then did something else.  The next minute, Dr. Joy comes in to check on me and says, "Well, that's it you're all done!"  No pain, no discomfort, no jack.  Going back to get a regular dental check-up and cleaning like I'm supposed to.</text><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

Though the docile and beautiful Asian masseurs look small, they are quite powerful. The pressure they apply during the massage makes you feel so good. I would recommend to everyone.</Text>

Amazing experience. You know what it is. Excellent service. I don't think it can get any better. First time in San Francisco and k don't think I'll go to any other massage parlor in this city. Don't listen to all the other crapy reviews. The place doesn't stink, it was clean and had great customer service . It's a must do< /Text>

Stay clear of this place. Rude staff, very expensive and designed to get as much cash from you as possible.

The level of the actual massage and service was not good. The Massause had a poor attitude, wasn’t good at massaging and the whole experience was very poor.

I would urge anyone to stay clear. Trust me you will regret spending your cash here.</review>

I found empier massage as one of the most poorest massage service provider
With ful of prostitut.
No massage service if you don’t go for happy ending
It is so sad and unprofessional
So I don’t recommend people to go in empier massage for massage.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It's the worst.
I was tired and paid 70 dollars in an hour to get a massage, but this was like a prostitute, and I received a relentless sale from a Thai woman during massage.
I didn't feel like that at all, so if I refused it many times, I went out in the middle of the time.
The shopkeeper was like half an hour, so I was able to return half the price, but I couldn't accept it stubbornly.
I wanted to call the police to detect prostitution, but I gave up because the flight time was approaching.
People who are purely for massage should never go.

最悪です。
疲れていたのでマッサージをしようと思い1時間で70ドル払いましたが、ここは売春店のようで、マッサージ中タイ人女から執拗な売り込みを受けました。
そんな気は全くないので何度も断ると、時間半ばで出行ってしまいました。
店主らしきおっさんに時間半分だから半額返せと粘りましたが、頑なに受け付けられず。
警察を呼んで売春を摘発してもらおうと思いましたが、その後フライトの時間が迫っていたので断念しました。
純粋にマッサージ目的の人は絶対行かない方がいいと思います。<//Text><Time>1474872476562</Time>< username>

The weekend I spent here didn't see any unusual activity and the surroundings felt very safe and peaceful. Very accommodating when needed a late check out. For the price was a good weekend getaway spot.< /review>< pics>

<review>Clean and comfortable. Furniture seem like it was updated recently. Check in and out was quick and easy. Hand sanitizer is provided for each room.You should be warned that because of the way the building way laid out, it creates this wind cave with the parking lot. It can get quite loud in the morning with all the car traffic passing through Del Mar Ave. This could be an issue if you are a light sleeper and want to sleep in. This was not a problem at night since the traffic is way lighter.There's a mini side room attached to the main section of the room that has a sofa and nothing else. It would have been nice if there was a dinning table and 2 chairs in that room instead of a couch. Since the TV is in the main room in front of the bed, there's nothing to do in the side room. There is only 1 office chair for the desk, so if you want to get take out/eat in your hotel room and you are staying with more than one person, you will have to take turns sharing the chair to eat at the desk. The 2 things I mentioned above weren't that big of a deal to me. Overall Travelodge Rosemead location is a great place to stay on a budget< /review><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2daa5f22552bb:0xd61103148c9e926f< /GmapID>< UserId.>

This place is very great. The workers are very nice. Love my stay here. I cant wait to stay here again. It is very clean and all the rooms come with a stove. Which is great. Only thing that no pots or pans that come with the place. So bring your own. It is not that much money. You will love it.<//review>

<text>I had a good stay! No issues. I stayed during a weekday and had a corner room on the top floor so I did not experience any noise issues from other rooms. Place was relatively clean and exceeded my expectations based on prior reviews. Renovated. Check-in and check-out was simple and quick. Free parking and right off the freeway. Great/safe/cheaper place to stay if you are traveling into LA.<//text>< pics>

First of all i had stay at this property before more then once. Those past stays where great. From services to staff was beautiful. Just my last stay well not even stay i could say. I was walking in to check for my 3 nigts stay. As i was walking in two gang memenbers approach me telling to come outside the property which i ignore they came in confusing me as some one else. Property manager came outside to ask them to leave and ask me if i needed any help. I didnt want no problems with the law or the gang memebers. Then as i was going to check in for my stay. The property manager told me i couldnt check in he would cancel my reservation. Knowing i was approach by two gang memebers which had weapons on then one was a gun i believe. Putting my life in danger. He still refuse my stay. With no car i was left outside gang members where still there waiting on me. I call a uber to pick me up. I am not a gang memeber my self. I ask nicely twice if i could please check at least for the night. Refuse again. I have 2 kids to suport and be there financially. This happen last night around 10.<//Text>

<Review>I think the hotel may be a bit overpriced for the conditions of the room.  I thought it was clean.  The fact that the manager charged my card before I could even check in (even before check in time). I wanted to use a different card to pay for the room and he had already charged my card for authorization. I just felt that they should of called and informed the client of what they were doing. I felt it was the wrong way to handle that situation. Also my sheets were dirty. I had to ask for 2 new sets because the first set they brought me (after the ones that were already on the bed had stains and marks), had make up all over them.  So he brought me a new set of sheets. I know they may be clean but I feel if your charging $130 a night we should at least have clean sheets.<//Review><rating>None</rating><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Stayed for 2 weeks in the room with bathtub and kitchen. The staffs are really kind. Parking area is decent. The room was perfect for me and my boyfriend. Kitchen was awesome we could cook whenever we wanted to. Bathtub was just enough for 1 person. Only problem was that when we first got there the floor was not clean, they might have forgotten to sweep or something. Everything else was fine and clean. Overall great stay with the great price. Would come back for the next trip.< /Review>

My first night here, had to stay 2more nights but I dont think so, we kept scratching most of the night, even my little one, unpleasant experience bed bugs in the beds, king size bed, noise from road and next rooms you can hear it all. Wouldnt recommend this place. I gave a one star for the price, and amenities like fridge and microwave.<//text>

pretty decent hotel. i checked in late, but didn't have to wait for the clerk at all. she was quick and thorough. my room was really clean. quiet. i had no problems with parking each night. there were plenty of towels. the shower pressure was really good and shower head tall, which is a rarity. there were water spots on shower door. the water was so hot and relaxing. the kitchen was clean. i tried the hot top, but couldn't figure it out so i left it alone. the wifi was nice. plenty of plugs for all my devices. the bed and pillows were really comfortable. i slept really well. i love that there was no carpet which means the room had no odor when i entered. i did see a few(3) ants on the bed by the window(had a double room). i would stay here again.</Text>

<review>For the price you pay this place is great. Bathrooms seemed to be renovated and the room was spacious enough and clean. The place is right by the highway which is a plus. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they advertised a "continental breakfast" which was one of the reasons I went with the place but it ended up being just a jug of orange juice and some old pre-packaged danishes. You will need to make other breakfast plans!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2daa5f22552bb:0xd61103148c9e926f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

So first I'd like to say if you are reading this review and expecting the Ritz or Hilton, please don't bother. This is a budget hotel option for travelers. Now if you have that in mind and are still looking at staying, than you'll see my review and rating makes sense!

To give you an idea, I am an outside sales rep whose territory is pretty much ALL of SoCal. I had an event last night in Carpenteria, and had to be in La Canada in the early AM. Rather than drive to my home in Orange County, I figured a local option may be best. Well...for those who have traveled in LA before...local options are not cheap at all. You pretty much need to plan to spend over $100 a night which for me, I just needed a bed, a shower, and maybe a quick snack in the AM. Lots of those options under $100 sadly were either too far away, or reviews were EXTREMELY poor. Then I find this gem! Not to say it doesn't have it's flaws even for a budget location, but here is the GOOD, the BAD, and the UGLY

Good
It's affordable! Hoteltonight had an even bigger discount for the last minute reservation. On top of that, free Wi-Fi and Free Parking! Free continental as well so I was happy, and it was in a nice area centrally located near my appointments so it was an easy transition. Plus, rooms were recently renovated and looked really nice! Don't let the outside shell fool you, and for those worried about the safety of parking you vehicle, well Rosemead is actually a pretty safe neighborhood in most places. Plus, they FLOOD LIGHT the parking lot! Thank god for black out blinds, but it made me feel safe at 1 AM.

Bad
My room was on the second floor and in the corner so I had a pretty big room with a little nook as well. The nook had no desk, but the entrance did. I'd probably move some stuff around to the nook as it seems odd to just have a couch only. The bed creaked and wasn't the best, but I was exhausted and slept fine as long as I didn't move too much. Came with essentials like soap and shampoo, and again for the price and the fact that I just needed a place for less than 10 hours, not bad. My only other complaint would be the towels. They didn't have full size towels, only hand towels and wash rags. I didn't call downstairs since again...1 AM, but maybe bring a towel just in case.

Ugly
My ONLY Ugly would be the toilet. It made noise ALL NIGHT and morning. Had to close the bathroom door which solved the problem. Literally, didn't really hear it at all until I opened the door again that morning. Not sure if this was just in my room (231) or all the others, but needless to say wasn't fun at first.

Overall a great experience! Again didn't bother management cause it was 1 AM and wasn't expecting the most amazing stay, but to my surprise for the type of establishment it was, and the price, I was very much impressed! This will be my go to should I have any appointments in LA and need a place to stay! Basic accommodations and amazing price!< /Text>

This hotel offered a free complementary breakfast. Turns out the complementary breakfast was just 1 packaged pastry and a cup of coffee ! The bathroom shower is absolutely disgusting and I woke up with a bug bite on my leg ! I would not come back again.< /Text>

Fast internet service.  Nice and quiet.  Rooms aren't very big but they do have a full size fridge, sink and a small two-burner electric stove.  My only complaint would have to be the weatherstripping on the doors but other than that this place is quite nice for budget accommodations.<//review>

If I could give negative stars I would. My husband and I stayed here as a last minute reservation New Year’s Eve, based on the 4.6 star review we figured $119 was reasonable. We could not have been more wrong. The moment we walked in the first thing we saw were muddy foot prints all over the filthy floor, the pillows on the bed were piled on one side, couch cushions flipped backwards, and  what appeared to be dried urine In the corner. The tv and fridge didn’t work, and when we went to call the front desk we discovered the phone also didn’t work. We stayed long enough to take plenty of pictures of this disgusting room. After leaving my husband went in to get refund and had to deal with a very confrontational unapologetic front desk man. Very unhappy do not waste your time or money. Despite the ratings do not stay here absolutely filthy rooms!</text>

<Review>This is a low cost hotel with only soap provided. Sometimes there were not enough towels in the room. The room was reasonably clean and comfortable. A few improvements are needed.1. Shampoo the carpet especially the area at the door which is completely black.2. WiFi signal was weak inside the room. I needed to sit close to the door and kept the door open.3. The handle of the faucet in the shower only went half way around, so the water was barely warm. The handle was blocked.4. The air conditioner was located right above the head of the bed. It is hard to fall asleep with the noise from the a/c.<//Review><UserId.>None<//UserId.>< user_name>

< review>
It was alright.....my bf and I reserved a room for one night, I made a call to see when the latest time to check in was since we were going to check in very late at night, so a man answers the phone and let’s me know it’s at midnight and I was still talking to him and he immediately hangs up the phone which was so RUDE. When we arrived the woman who checked us in was very polite, the continental breakfast area is a joke, negative 0 Stars. Our room was on the second floor, it didn’t seem like they had an elevator which would have been really nice with our heavy luggage we had to carry up, but it was also very late and we didn’t bother to check if there was an elevator on the opposite side. When we entered the room, it was really hot and muggy, didn’t smell bad and it looked refurbished and new. The floor was sticky and nasty though and there were ants crawling on the floor and on the wall, I got bit by ants a few times while sleeping and ants were on my luggage in the morning. At least the bed was made well, sheets were clean, trash was empty, the AC worked very well, the shower had good water pressure and cold/hot water. The towels were clean, restroom was the cleanest place and there is a fair amount of parking as well, no noisy neighbors around either. All in all, I would only stay there again as a last resort, it was a fairly great deal for a last minute stay, but I would not stay there long term. Would rather spend a little extra for a better and friendlier hotel.< /review>

Travelodge was poorly managed. The manager put us into 2 seperate rooms, one of the rooms smelled like urine and had trash that was supposed to be taken out in the trashcan and had certain objects missing, the second room was dirty, noone swept or washed the floors, the bed wasn't made and the walls had dirty spots on them. After seeing those rooms we asked for another room and the manager tried to play us dumb telling us he can't refund our purchase even though my hotel has the same system as that hotels, after we told the manager that he said," hold up, let me call my manager." He only had the phone up to his head for 3 seconds then put it down and said sure thing and moved us to a clean room. After those two rooms we had some speculations but nothing was really wrong with the room, only thing was that towels were missing. Later that night our freind that lives in LA pulled up to the hotel and we talked a bit and after 30 minutes the manager asked us rudely to go back in our room. Also in the morning there was no continental breakfast, Other than that the hotel was good but i'd still not stay there.<//review>

< Review>
One word to describe my experience with the hotel HORRIBLE! Check in desk was the size of a closet with glass window. Got stuck on third floor with sun shining directly into the room. The room was about 110 degrees lucky us hottest day in L.A. Couldnt get the AC to turn on, called the front desk comes to find out theres a switch way above main light switch that I have to switch on. Security latch on door broken, bed sheet has stain and cigarette burn, kitchen table wobble like its going to break, frig was dirtier then my fishing cooler, shower was slow and backward for water temp control, and blinds are black, dusty, and gross. One word again HORRIBLE! Just stay away.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Large, clean rooms. Directly on the exit at Interstate 10, very handy if you travel east the next day.

Grote, schone kamers. Direct aan de afslag bij de Interstate 10, erg handig als je de dag erna richting oosten reist.< /Review>

< review>
Das Hotel bietet von innen mehr, als es von aussen erwarten lässt. Die Rezeption ist gerade mal 2x1 Meter groß und beinhaltet auch den Frühstücks Bereich,  der aus 2 Kaffeekannen und einem Körbchen mit abgepackten Waffeln oder Muffins.  Der Kaffee war um 9.30 übrigens leer...Parkplätze sind zu wenig,  wer zu spät kommt muss auf der Straße parken (so wie ich).Den durchwachsenen Eindruckvon draußen machen die Zimmer aber wieder wett.  Sehr groß und modern, alles sauber und gepflegt.  Wer nur im sauberen Zimmer übernachten will und auf viel drumrum verzichten kann ist hier richtig.  Ich würde wieder buchen!< /review>

Hotel en périphérie de LA.Nous avons été décu de cet hotel. Nous avons été tout dabord accueillis dans une premiere chambre où il ny avait pas de pommeau de douche mais surtout lavabo sale (dentifrice séché et taches noires) avec le chiffon de ménage resté à coté, WC sale également. Dans la 2eme chambre, le lavabo était correct mais le bac de douche était noir de crasse et WC pas top, et bref tout jai tout passé à la lingette désinfectante. Sinon le reste de la chambre est correct. Le petit dejeuner est très limité : jus dorange, café, et viennoiserie en sachet (en mm temps vaut mieux vu la propreté de la chambre)< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Well, it's ok. The school grade 3 describes it best.
It's a motel and it's cheap so don't come here with too high expectations. We stayed 2 nights and it was good for that ..
It's not super clean, but neither is it dirty (and I'm sensitive to that). Fridge and microwave are available and work. The kitchen is there as a separate room, but without dishes (I didn't ask about them either). The kitchen wasn't really clean, so I wouldn't have cooked anyway. Bed is comfortable, linen was clean. Bathroom was ok. There were no bugs or anything like that. We were up on the first floor.
The staff is very nice. In the morning there are a few packaged sweets and coffee from a rather calcified coffee pot downstairs in the narrow reception room, which tastes amazingly good.
During the day we were out anyway. It is also not a place where you spend the day and go on vacation. I wouldn't book here for that.

Parking lot is large and in the courtyard, so you can see the car from the room window.
Despite the glass at the reception, I felt safe as a woman here. It was seldom to see anyone either in the inner courtyard or outside on the street, actually never .. that is clearly a part of the city where you don't walk but drive everywhere by car.
There are many single-family houses with small gardens in the area. No ghetto or similar not even begin to .. the Walmart 6 min. from the hotel is super sorted.

The only really negative point because of which I subtract the 2nd star is WiFi. That didn't work at all and we were accommodated above the reception. Every 2 min. the connection broke off, you had to log in again, re-enter your password, etc. Really exhausting and annoying.

Otherwise ok for 1-3 nights!

(Original)
Na ja, es ist ok. Die Schulnote 3 beschreibt es am besten.
Es ist ein Motel und es ist günstig, also darf man nicht mit zu hohen Erwartungen hierher kommen. Wir waren 2 Nächte und dafür war es gut..
Es ist nicht super sauber, aber auch nicht schmutzig (und ich bin empfindlich was das angeht). Kühlschrank und Microwelle sind vorhanden und funktionieren. Küche ist zwar als abgetrennter Raum da, aber ohne Geschirr (ich habe auch nicht danach gefragt). Die Küche war nicht wirklich sauber, also hätte ich eh nicht gekocht. Bett ist bequem, die Bettwäsche war sauber. Badezimmer war ok. Es gab kein Ungeziefer oder ähnliches. Wir waren oben im ersten Stock.
Das Personal ist sehr nett. In der früh gibt es unten im engen Empfangszimmer ein paar verpackte süße Teilchen und Kaffee aus einer ziemlich verkalkten Kaffeekanne, der erstaunlich gut schmeckt.
Tagsüber waren wir eh unterwegs. Es ist auch kein Ort wo man sich tagsüber aufhält und Ferien macht. Dafür würde ich hier nicht buchen.

Parkplatz ist groß und im Innenhof, also man sieht das Auto vom Zimmerfenster aus.
Trotz der Glasscheibe an der Rezeption habe ich mich als Frau hier sicher gefühlt. Es war, weder im Innenhof noch draußen auf der Straße, seltenst jemand zu sehen, eigentlich nie.. das ist eindeutig ein Teil der Stadt, wo man nicht zur Fuss läuft sondern immer und überall mit dem Auto fährt.
In der Gegend sind viele Einfamilienhäuser mit kleinen Gärten. Kein Getto o.ä. nicht mal ansatzweise.. der Walmart 6 min. vom Hotel ist super sortiert.

Der einzig wirklich negative Punkt wegen dem ich den 2. Stern abziehe, ist WLAN. Das hat überhaupt nicht funktioniert und wir waren über der Rezeption untergebracht. Alle 2 min. brach die Verbindung ab, man musste sich neu anmelden, Passwort neu eingeben usw. Echt anstrengend und ärgerlich.

Sonst für 1-3 Nächte ok!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Peaceful and beautiful. For my first time actually spending the day alone and coming across this park, I felt a little better. It's hard to not look strange with a skate board and back pack but whatever lol.<//review>

If you want to have a nice experience at this park i would say to come early and get out early and even with that being said you must beware of aggressive dogs, my dog Luca is a big white german shepherd and is a total sweetheart but he can defend himself. If you have a smaller animal and there are aggressive dogs in the large area i would definitely go to the small dog area just to be safe.< /text>

They put a sign  that says your dog has to be fix in order to bring him or her in the dog park. That’s is rude, I’m not going to fix my dog just to bring him to a dog park, he’s not aggressive and dogs are not affected by him,< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Great park, awesome little splash pad for the kids to cool off in the summer heat. Not too crowded arrive early to get a spot under the tree with some shade. Little dog park, playground etc. At 4:00 pm everyday the ice cream truck comes down. She's not just a regular truck she has Chamaangos, Huge swirled cone, banana splits, hot Cheetos, tostilocos etc. Come down everyone is friendly.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I frequently visit the dog park here because it's the closest to home. The dog park is in desperate need of renovation. The park could use more lighting, more seating areas, and shade. The park also has a few local transients who hang out near the dog park area but other than a couple of random outbursts there has never been any trouble with them.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Plenty of joy is here for any dog to enjoy the company & comradery of fellow dogs. Sorta like a open bar but for dogs. Now who doesn't enjoy free cocktail at a happy hour at a local bar huh?< /Text>

Fun place to take your dog to socialize. Mostly grassy area with water supply for the pups. Not too many places to sit though so you're mostly standing if theres a lot of other people.</review>

<text>This park has EVERYTHING: Playground, water pad, dog park & a baseball field with a snack shack! (Snack shack is open only during games) Surrounded by towering trees, which creates a beautiful, shady area. There's over 5 picnic area's, you can put one on hold by calling Parks & Rec. I've been coming here for decades now, celebrated my birthday as a kid & now, my son enjoys coming!</text>< response>

Love this park! Hands down ome of my kids favorite parks. They love they play structure that resembles a rocket/space ship. They have swings for big kids and babies, they have a splash pad and an ample amount of running room. Tons of picnic areas, so a great place to have a party, they have the splash pad which is a huge plus especially in the summer. They also have a section for dogs, which is also fun for the kids. Though i do not let my kids in with the dogs (some people do that there, so dog folks be ware) I do let them watch the dogs from outside the fence. No joke my kids could sit for hours and watch the dogs play. Anyways, lots of fun, lots to do, and lots of space.<//review>

<text>My girlfriend and I brought our dogs here for a little doggies day and I was so impressed. There were two separate sections, one for small dogs and one for big dogs. We took our dogs, Lucy and Winnie, into the big dog section. It was a Tuesday but the park was packed full of doggies. I was a little nervous with so many strange dogs but every single one was friendly and played well with all the other dogs. Maybe the strangest part was that all of the dog owners were super friendly too and the "regulars" even seemed to have some sort of dog lover clique. Everyone knew everybody else's dogs names. Toys and water bowls were strewn all about and were free for anyone to use. Winnie is just a puppy and this was a great place for her to burn off all of that puppy energy. Lucy is better than old girl but she really enjoyed all of the dog owners were willing to pet her while she sat and watched the other dogs play. I took a ton of videos but I didn't get a single picture!!</text>< pics>

<review>This dog park is a decent size and the gates and fence are secure. The problem lies with all dog parks, people don't look after their dogs and there are frequent fights. The rest of the park is nice, there is a great playground for children as well as a water park for little ones to cool off in the summer. If you are used to the problems of other people not being able to manage their own dogs, then this dog park might be worth a visit, but if you are looking for an outing with your pup amonst responsible pet owners with well trained animals you might want to give this place a miss.<//review>< pictures>

Nice dog park. The only bad side is the people. Some of the usual's are kind of rude. I just think if you don't want your dog to play with other dogs why bring them. Yes they are going to get dirty and get drool on them. I have met some nice people also.< /Review>

There is lots of patchy grass, but for the most part well maintained.  Some tennis balls of various quality are usually around as well as multiple water dishes.

The are multiple trash cans as well as free poopie bags.  Seems like most people clean up after their dogs.

The large dog pen seems usually more rowdy and I've seen a few snafus over there.< /Text>< user>

<review>Very nice and open park. One area we used as a gathering. Going down a bit more is a mini water park you can reserve with the city. The bathroom is a bit annoying to get to, but otherwise a very nice and spacious place. Its also AKA a dog park, though the times we went not many people were walking dogs. It also has a dog pen area where you can let loose with other owners!<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2d7c34bb81523:0x347f1cf88a44f5a2<//gmap_id>< Rating>

Two fenced areas for dogs and their people: one for small dogs and another for large dogs. The two enclosures share a common fence, but I've never observed any difficulties between the two groups of dogs. There are a couple of benches, and a picnic table, at which people can sit.<//Text>

Some dog owners do not control their dogs on the side for small dogs. They bring dogs that are too big and/or way too aggressive, and let them terrorize all the other dogs. If your dog doesn't play well with others, maybe get them some obedience training before letting them off the leash.</text>

I take my two little dogs to the dog park and they love it, I grew up just 5 houses down from the park and I am back taking care of my mom and I love Del Norte Park and all the changes they have made over the years, they put in a water park, dog park one for small dogs and one for large dogs, they upgraded the playground for the kids, this park is very nice and accommodating for everyone's needs</text>

<Review>Lots of parking, restrooms are close by, and there's lights on til 10-1030 pm. Like with any park, survey the dogs inside before entering, the large side can get rough because of irresponsible owners not keeping their dogs in check. As for the people park, watch out for bones and food in the grass as you walk to the dog park, weekend partiers are huge litterers. And there has been an increase in homeless presence, but they mostly keep to themselves.<//Review>< pics>

<review>It's a cool place to bring the kids and pretty relaxing but they need to clean this place up. There are always bums hanging out at the benches and by the baseball fields.</review>< Date>

Its only 3 because it was really dirty all over the ground and especially by the picinic tables toatlly dirty trashy looking around every where, and dog park is right there to where people aren't inside their space and allowing them to wonder under our table and not on leash or anything and few people were like doing that plus screaming for the dogs to come on come here dog .interrupting  our conversations. Plain rude and digs need to walk on leashes a knot underneath our feet and have people yelling in their faces and the water park the splash pad was off when it should have been on for whatever reason we can't get it to turn on and it wasn't time for it to be off so the kids didn't get to play in the water where they were supposed to be able to you and there was nobody around to talk to you to see why it wasn't on and the bathrooms were dirty and the playground it's kind of dangerous and one of the slides to fall right off the slide going when you're going down and there's nothing to catch you and hold you onto it that's the only things I didn't like about that park also there was hardly any benches with seats for in the shade it was all sunny sunny sunny too hot there that's like its three stars.</Text>

Crowded but convinent location, plenty of parking and few of the park still have quite some grass in the dog play area. This part does not have dog friend water fountain so bring your bottle and bowl.<//text>
