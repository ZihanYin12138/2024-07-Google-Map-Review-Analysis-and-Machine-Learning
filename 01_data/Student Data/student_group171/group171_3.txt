I emailed late afternoon and scheduled an appointment the following morning.  Got two notifications about when the tech would arrive.  He was courteous and helpful.  When he gave me the quote I was a little put off because it seemed high.  The work was done in a timely manner, I paid the bill and immediately did a search for what the average cost of this repair would be and they were within 20 dollars of the national average.  They are anything but average!!!  We will be using them often as we are preparing to launch a Property Management business.  Do not hesitate to use RICHCO!</Text>

Excellent company. I had an emergency and called them to figure out a water heating issue. They sent someone over within the hour to fix it. The plumber was professional and knowledgeable. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good plumbing company in the area (which can be difficult to find).</Text>

<username>Initialg g< /username><text>Called Richco and I was given a same day appointment.  This was great because the service was for my mother's place and I needed service that same day. It was awesome that Edgar able to evaluate the shower and provide recommendations in a timely manner.  He scheduled the repair the very next day and he did great work.  Will definitely use Richco for any plumbing services in the future 😀</text>< userid>

Our water heater had been improperly installed at the home we just bought.  We got a referral for RichCo as an “ethical” plumbing service and they more than delivered.  Arturo was fantastic - very knowledgeable, helpful, hard working.  It was a lot of work to repair the damage done by another plumbing company but they did an excellent job at a very reasonable price, and in half a day.  Will definitely be using them for all of our plumbing needs going forward.< /Text>

I continue to be impressed with Richco Plumbing, from the call to make the appointment to the technicians and the final result.

I had a slab leak that my HOA was responsible to fix, so we decided to get a couple quotes on the repair.  We were referred to Richco from another plumber that we had used but they weren't available.  When Robert Summers came to check out the leak and quote the job, he looked at the job from a long term perspective, not just a quick fix.  He brought up things the other plumber didn't and we felt we were in good hands so we hired him.  Once the repair started, Robert encountered a problem due to the leak detection company who had marked off the wrong place.  Robert quickly figured out a fix, and although it took more time and money, the job was done well.  Robert and his assistant were always friendly, on time and cleaned up everything each day.  We will definitely be using Richco and requesting Robert Summers again and will also use them for leak detection in the future, rather than hiring a separate company which will hopefully avoid the errors we encountered.</review>

We have a clogged bathroom sink and called Richco to come evaluate. Edgar ran a camera down to see if he could find the problem but it turns out the camera he has isn’t a long enough one. He said there’s another person in the company that provides that service and we can call to set a time up with him. The overall evaluation of the situation is that we’re most likely looking at roots coming through the old pipes or even a collapsed pipe. Edgar was polite and professional!<//review>

Richco Plumbing came in for a hot water slab leak, they checked it out and once they opened the floor they saw it was leaking heavily.  So they called in Water Restoration to take a look.  The leak was bigger than we thought it was and we needed a full pipe repair, with removing our floors and drywall.  Richco also replaced our water heater because we didn't have any hot water and was a separate issue from the slab leak.  They were professional and answered all my questions, let me know what was going on each day. They worked well with the Water Restoration Company.  I would recommend them to anyone that needs plumbing repairs.<//Review>

Originally RichCo came out to clear a fault code and clean the reccommended components. Come to find out I paid $750.00 to have the code cleared and nothing cleaned.  The technician was there less than two hours. Would not reccommend to anyone!</Review>

I was referred to RichCo by a colleague and I was very satisfied with their service. They were prompt to schedule service for me the following day and Tony arrived right on time and was prepared to tackle my issues. He explained what he was evaluating and provided a written estimate before he started the work. Once he had the kitchen sink cleared he showed me the problem and provided some helpful advice. He cleaned up the work area and left everything exactly the way it was when he arrived. Tony provided very professional service, listened to my questions and address them in detail. So thankful I called RichCo. I already have plans to call them for another project I have planned!</text>

Richco did a whole host of repairs and replacement at my house, all my sewage lines needed replacement including under my foundation and trenchless in my front yard, my whole home needed repiping, and a new natural gas line as well, my house is 58 years old and everything was original and in bad shape, the whole experience was great, the techs were here early everyday, professional, kind, hard working, the owner Rich even came out to meet me when I called them for an estimate, which made me feel good that the owner himself came out to see the whole project, a tree  had to be removed because it's roots were getting into the sewer line and instead of just leaving a blank area of dirt his tech landscaped the area,  and It looks great !!  I had them install a tankless water heater and a whole home water filtration system while I was at it too.. everything works great, love everything about Richco.. I would highly recommend Richco for all your plumbing needs..<//Text>

I have written few reviews.  I have a rental in Ventura and I don't live nearby.  The new, wonderful tenants called me with leaks under the kitchen sink.  Richco Plumbing sent Fernando to my rental.  From the moment Fernando arrived, I was impressed.  He was polite, put booties over his shoes to keep the kitchen floor clean, analyzed the need, had the parts on his well stocked truck and made the repair to perfection.  I had other concerns that were preventive and one in particular I had done under this older home that has a raised foundation.  He also pointed out several repairs that should be considered and which I plan to do in the future as he provided fair, written estimates.  I will request Fernando now that he knows the home.  I have had several poor experiences with plumbing companies at my personal residence and I would have NO hesitation in having Richco Plumbing at my home and referring them to others.  The staff they have answering phones and following up are exceptional too.  This is not a "one man" company that is difficult to reach.  I am very impressed with this company in general and specifically Fernando, the technician.</text>

Paul arrived on time and quickly unfroze laundry room faucets, making replacements unnecessary.  Next, determined need to replace older pressure regulator, and returned the next morning to install the replacement part.  Knowledgable and professional.<//Text>

<Review>Excellent experience and work! I needed the fire ring replaced in our outdoor fire pit. The owner came out, gave us a completely reasonable quote, then came back to do top notch work. Wasn’t hard, but they took the time to get all the details right. Very professional experience. I’d completely recommend Richco to others based on my experience. 👍 (I’m replacing the stones, so we chose to leave them out for now.)<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

Had a toilet leaking and called to get some help. After a very easy phone call the appointment was made for the next day (more from my schedule than theirs) and the gentleman showed up and did a great job. Super easy to make payments after the services were rendered. I also appreciated the email verifying who was going to be coming to help me out with a photo!  Would recommend to anyone to use Richco!</review>

<Text>The pilot of our hot water tank busted recently when I was on an international trip.  My wife contacted Richco based on a friend's recommendation.  A technician came to our house 1.5 hr later than the time window provided, and he was there for merely 10 minutes and told my wife the pilot was gone, and we were charged $229 for the diagnosis.  The guy also said the cost of a new pilot would be over $500 and if we we decide to go with it, the diagnostic fee will be applied as credit...
Long story short, we were not happy about the work, and I compliant to Richco.  Today I got a call from the owner and he offered his sincere apology and waived the fee completely.  We are really impressed by Richard's approach to our compliant.  For that we will contact Richco in future if we have other plumbing needs.<//Text><GmapID>0x80e83672893dbda3:0x21425e0ee869fb71< /GmapID><user_name>Thomas Zhu</user_name></record>

After a kitchen remodel I had a disaster, The kitchen counter remodelers were supposed to bring a plumber to do all the plumbing work but never did, so left me high and dry. During the remodel, all the plumbing got unplugged and dismantled, The water valve was leaking, all the drain pipes and fittings were not aligned anymore. Called several places and no one was able to come to me in a timely manner except, Richco. I’m so glad I called them, Fernando came out in 20 minutes, I realize sometimes that can always happen that quickly but I was fortunate that day. Very friendly very well skilled he was able to put everything back together replace some parts that definitely needed to be replaced because of age and waI’m so glad I called them, Fernando came out in 20 minutes, I realize sometimes that can always happen that quickly but I was fortunate that day. Very friendly, well mannered, and very well skilled. He was able to put everything back together replace some parts that definitely needed to be replaced because of age, upfront pricing, The owner even stopped by to drop off a part that we needed was very friendly as well. In my opinion a very well run, very organized company. All in all, I would highly recommend them! Thanks Guys!

I recommend their services and will definitely use them when needed in the future. Thank you!< /text>

We had water damage in our condo, from exploding pipe to a slab leak.  Richco came immediately - was able to explain everything that needed to be  done.  They gave us a time table and kept to it.  The "customer service" was/is outstanding.< /Review>

Great service! My house is now 40 years old, and they’ll be my plumbers from now on! I was quoted an insane amount for my restroom work and Richco came in for a second opinion and found nothing wrong, absolutely trustworthy!

<review>We needed the flappers on a couple of toilets changed, along with two faulty spigots (one shower, one in the backyard). RichCO was very professional in coming out on the same day and fixing what needed fixing (even replacing a broken shut-off valve that we didn't even know about). Highly recommended!</review><Resp>{'time': 1576620301875, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review. We appreciate your business!'}</Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<date>1503759855945< /date><Review>Richco Plumbing is the BEST!!!  I had a problem with my toilets and showers not draining in my house.  I called Richco and Celina answered the phone.  She said she would dispatch a technician to inspect the problem.  The technician, Juan, arrived on time.  He was professional, respectful, courteous and friendly.  Juan found the problem and went to work.  Juan and his manager Ben were able to take care of my issue at a fair price.  Richco Plumbing's employees exceeded my expectations every step of the way.  They have earned my future business and I will recommend Richco to my friends and family.  Thank you Juan, Celina and Ben!</Review>< Pictures>

<Name>John Gruenewald<//Name><time>1556432677716</time><rate>1< /rate><review>Called on Monday and they said the soonest they could send a guy to inspect the issue was on Friday between 9 - 10am.  Fine.  Thursday comes and while I'm at work, they call to 'confirm' the appointment.  I couldn't get to the phone and they had closed calls after I tried calling after work.  Friday morning, I call and the lady answering the phone is excessively indignant and upset I didn't confirm the appointment. Seriously?? What was there to confirm? And why was the assumption to cancel when I couldn't answer an unexpected phone call during the work day? Moving on: they rescheduled the appointment, and the plumber finally came to access the situation.  He gave a very nondescript quote of, "that'll be $100, that'll be another $100, oh and that'll also be another $100."  But also cleverly crafted a plan of dropping the bill by $100 if we provided a nice tip.  Alright, well we didnt give a tip and we didnt go with Richco. Found someone else who gave straight pricing and wasnt difficult to arrange an appointment to repair the day of.  TL,DR: Find another plumber.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I have been using RichCo Plumbing since I bought my first house in the early 90’s.  I would never consider anyone else.  Under Rich’s leadership, the entire crew and staff are amazing.  I recently did some renovations which required a lot of plumbing and I came to know several of the men who work for RichCo.  Without exception, they are the finest crew I have ever worked with.  The work is meticulous, the time in which they respond to their calls is lightning fast and they are the nicest and most caring guys I have ever worked with.  You know you are in good hands when the building inspector says “Your plumbers are doing a great job!”   So a continued thank you to Rich, Eric, Ricardo, Jeremy and all the gang for many years of great work.< /text>< Gmap_id>

I can't say enough wonderful things about Richco.  After getting one opinion from another plumber, and realizing things were bad.  Richco came promptly and showed me clear video camera live shots in color of my pipes and their deterioration. They explained my options and gave detailed estimates. They repiped the house before the pipes caved in.  They repaired the few holes made into the walls behind sinks and toilets.  They laid down paper and kept everything immaculately clean as they carried out bucketfuls of dirt and then brought it all back in. When we saw how much dirt was removed, we couldn't believe things could be so well cleaned up as if nothing had ever happened.  Their estimates on how long the work would take and how much it would cost were totally accurate and reasonable.  If you have bad plumbing problems, Richco is the one to trust.< /review>

<text>Probably my favorite spot for a warm bowl of Chinese soup noodle in Oakland.  I've been coming to this restaurant forever,  perhaps almost 40 years and the foods are always consistently good since my first visit.  If you're looking for friendly service and family atmosphere the please give this little germ a try. The restaurant is small so it's not suitable for a large party.  Pictured is my favorite bowl:  Roasted duck noodle soup.  Credit cards accepted.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Foods are all good. Beef rice noodle with too much meat. Congee is delicious. I saw how they make the thin rice sheet to wrap the fried stick – youtiao and ordered one: the sheet is great but fried stick is kind of hard. Service is affable. When I tried to get hot water for my ever-presence tea bottle and couldn’t, she said “oh you don’t know” and went on to show me.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

It's cheaper than others in the area and the food is just as good. The place is clean as well. These people have been around for so long I never noticed it because of the filthy sidewalk outside. I am really glad I discovered this place. I can now enjoy the chinese old school cuisine and still ball on a budget.< /review>

Our usual place (Joy Luck) was closed! So my Grandpa wanted to go two storefronts down to Gum Wah. It's a big restaurant with lot of seating.
Like Joy Luck restaurant, Gum Wah is what Americans would call a hole in the wall (or to me, normal).
Before I ordered I saw what others were eating. It all looked so good. It was lunchtime and most people ordered lunch special items.
We got chow fun with prawn, rice porridge fish filet, yin yang fried rice, bitter melon lunch special and some typical beef string bean lunch special.
The chow fun was amazing. I loved it! It was so flavorful. It's the saucy style chow fun I like too.
The rice porridge was tasty. It had plenty of fish and 1 whole egg (1000 yr old).
Bitter melon was good for bitter melon.
The yin yang fried rice was the dish I ordered, and it wasn't to par. I was kind of sad. The rice seemed old/dry. The tomato sauce did not have much taste. I think I was unlucky!
I give this place 5 stars because I would get the chow fun again. Another customer had the black bean chow fun... I wanted it...
Would definitely go back!< /text>

<user>110374178256335387907< /user><review>They have great rice porridge offered at a very cheap price. I usually am very satisfied with just one bowl of their porridge. I would recommend the pork liver which is chewy and seasoned.

Their rice noodles are also very good; a great comfort food choice!<//review>< name>

<Review>We have frequented this great establishment for 35 Years.   We first discovered it when living in San Leandro, and the great food recalls us regularly, even after moving to Stockton in 1983.  Well worth the time.  Suggest the parking garage between Webster and Fulton.< /Review>< Pictures>

Amazing meal ! We ordered the Thai mussels - mussels are THE thing to order here, they come in 4 different sauce options, only $16 per plate and each order has enough mussels for a whole meal. We shared an order and were full with just that :)<//review>

This is my go to for Chinese porridge. Some porridge places are sheisty with the meat or other fillings in their porridge, but not this place. They give you a good amount of toppings at a really good price. And of course they boil the heck out of that rice, and so you get beautiful cooked down pieces of rice swimming in watery rice broth. Topped off with ginger and cilantro. It's pure class. Classy congee made in a hole in a wall. Dunk in pieces of the youtiao (donuts/cruller) and you're golden! My favorite is the sampan, but all of them are pretty yummy.

Other exceptional items:

Roasted duck
Roasted pork
Shrimp crepe rice roll
Duck won ton and egg noodle soup
Beef stew and egg noodle soup< /Review>

Small pepperonis, but the slices were tasty. Nice decor on the inside. Looks like they have bar service, but I haven’t tried it out.< /text>

<review>During pandemic: no mask, handling the dough with no gloves, touching multiple surfaces, then back to handling dough.  I’m sorry, but it makes no sense that some employees are masked, others are not.  Used to be a fan of this place but this is not customer / community first IMHO.</review>< rating>

Everything is high quality with fresh.  The portions are generous and frequently feed me for two lunches.  Very friendly staff and fast service.</text>

My son loves Pizza and always asks me to stop whenever we see a pizza place that we have not tried before. We stopped here for lunch on a Friday. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and my son got the Spicy Pig Calzone. We shared both. The pizza was very good, lots of cheese and chicken. It was hot, spicy, but not too hot, just the right amount of slow burn kick. We both liked the Calzone as well. It had jalapeno and it also had a good faster kick. We toped it off with a pitcher of cold beer for a fantastic lunch.< /Text>

Gave it a 2 because it’s pizza and I’ll eat any pizza, but I wouldn’t come back for it. Super basic flavor, multiple areas with missed toppings, and crust that is barely edible after it’s sat for 30 minutes.< /text>

The owners are so knowledgeable regarding their product.  I usually pick up the slice and drink combo for our grandkids.   Went in for a pizza for my husband and I, he recommended a few toppings and the pizza was AMAZING   Thank you, we'll be back.<//Text>

<Review>I've been a fan of this store since they opened at this location, but of late, the employees are different and they just dont seem to care. The restaurant is not clean like it used to be, the assortment of pre-made pizza is down to 1 or 2 at best.<//Review>< user>

Good prices, the 2 slices and a soda is very reasonable. The food is very tasty. The pizza is thin and crispy. They have an excellent tossed dinner salad (not just iceberg). A great place to watch sports events w/ large easy to view TV. Definitely give it a try !</review>

< review>
Went here recently for a school fundraiser and glad we did. The pizza was good including the calzones. I got a small calzone and half was good enough for me (especially when paired with the AMAZING garlic knots) so I also had leftovers for lunch later.
The only thing I wouldn't personally recommend is the cookies. They tasted like they were straight up tollhouse cookie dough like from the tubs you buy at costco. I'm not a fan of those myself
But everything else was really tasty and they have some good daily deals (like dollar wings). That plus their giving back to the local community makes this a great place to stop in for a slice.< /review>

<Review>Quality of pizza is good however I have had my pizza mutilated on multiple occasions. I always ask for a well done crust but have never had a pizza place construe it as "burnt to a crisp" until eating here. I would have given five stars of this had happened only once, but even after changing my phrasing to "a golden brown crust. Please don't burn it." I've still had my pizza burnt numerous times. I also have had my order misunderstood numerous times too. I once asked for no olives on a pizza and received the pizza with more olives than any other toppings.
Overall great pizza but lacking in understanding and cooking precision.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The pizza is thin, but not too thin and it taste really good. My favorite pizza place to order from. The slices are really big! You can ask then to double slice so the pieces are smaller.< /Text>< Pics>

Pizza is great. But they have NEVER gotten our order right.
Excuse is a lost ticket. Forgot the salad, forgot the broccolini, forgot the wings. They are 0 for 20. Done with these idiots.</text>

<text>The pizza is thin crust, foldable, toppings are fresh. The pepperoni gets crispy, the dough is chewy, not cakey or crumbly at all. They don't pile on cheese to weigh it down. The Brooklyn pie is the best with fresh garlic, meatball, pepperoni and mushrooms OMG. Prices are fair since the pie is so dang good. Beers on tap are great. Bathrooms have a baby change station in the women's only. Delivery starts late afternoon so if you want a pizza brunch then you'll have to drive. And lastly, the staff is so great! They're neighborly and happy. I always dig in before remembering to snap a photo, but one is coming soon of my beloved Brooklyn.<//text>< pics>

Man, we keep giving them chance after chance, yet the service remains terrible. The pizza is okay, but unfortunately, we need to stop coming here out of principle. We tried, but timely or courteous service just doesn't seem important to them. The guys just seem to be dudes hanging out, drinking beer, and goofing around, without regard to their customers. For instance, I'll leave you with the final timing on our current order when (or if) it ever comes out. They said 30min and it has been 50 so far...okay, I have to respectfully ask for my money back at 60 min, as there is no indication it is close to ready. Fun! Need a place to eat now. Have hungry kids.

Wow...I posted this just as I was about to ask for a refund, and things turned even worse. One of the guys there--I assumed he worked there, as he was answering phones--was clearly intoxicated. I'm talking slurred speech type of intoxicated. At that point, he was just sitting at the bar drinking. I asked the guy at the register if I could simply have my money back, because we were then around 65min into this ordeal. The first guy, w/o even an apology, walked away from me, and told someone else to handle it. A new guy appeared, a younger guy, who seemed super embarrassed by his "colleagues", attentively began my refund, apologizing along the way. I came to find out he was the manager. I assured him it had nothing to do with him. However, the drunk guy started heckling us from the bar. At first, I just assumed he was asking what happened to "make it good" with us. Quite the contrary. He began commenting  (slurring)  "Isn't it disappointing when you live a perfect life and expect others to be perfect too. That's life brother, no one is perfect!" I asked him if he was talking to me, and he kept egging me on. I then told him I didn't appreciate his smart mouth, and let him continue mumbling, while I finished my refund with the young manager. The poor kid looked horrified by this guy's behavior.

Okay, it gets even worse. As my son and I passed by him (with restraint, I kept silent, as my son clearly seemed nervous / anxious by this bizarre situation), the drunkard raised his fist in the air chanting "Smart-asses unite!", he got up and began following us toward the door. My son was frightened at that point. So, I turned around to freeze the guy by standing my ground at the door. He just kept heckling us (seriously a dad & a little boy), so I told him he'd better back off or he'd be sorry. As we walked out, he came to the door, and heckled us all the way to our car, telling me to "go to your temple and pray for perfection". I presume he was making an antisemitic remark. Not Jewish, but justifiably offended nonetheless. Unbelievable! My son remained shocked for a while, as we have never been in such a strange situation, where he felt threatened like that.

I will never return there again.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

New car wash in Brentwood,  even with the free car wash for opening very very organized and quick,  the employees very young people but extremely nice and courteous,  the wash by itself really good. Once done the vehicle is almost dry just few touches and ready to go..definitely  5 starts or more if possible... not only for the free wash but very fast and well done< /Text>

Michaela helped me the first time here and she was amazing and very attentive ! Made sure everything was working well and polite to every question! I will definitely come back! The vaccums work super well and two options to chose from! As well as air to blow out tiny spots ! Wash was great!< /Review>

I spend an extra $10 on the Best wash right? And I go through, they give me the wrong wash, all good I go around and told them I got the wrong wash. They write a number on my car so the dude specifically knows which wash to give me, on top of that one of his co-workers goes over an repremands him over it and specifically pointed out my car and tells him what wash to give me. He then selects the wrong wash again and I tell him its not the right wash and he just gave me a thumbs up and sent me through. Genuinely makes me not wanna go back again.</review>

I lean towards the five star because their service was great and the car wash is kept clean and the quality was pretty good I may have had a extra dirty car but I went through the car wash and it got a majority of the car cleaned but there was some debris still left on my car afterward so I went back around and the employees took care of me and did a rewash just to get what was left so I do appreciate that so far seems like a great car wash highly would recommend</text>

Yes, with an some aftermarket racks it is necessary that we do a top retract of the top wrap in order to safely wash your vehicle.  We apologize that the staff who checked you in did not explain this, we will address that with our team.  We can't speak for our competitors, but our customers know they can trust us to always do everything we can to make sure that their vehicle can travel through our wash safely.  We will ask that the aftermarket rack be removed or we will need to retract the top wrap in order to prevent damage to your vehicle, any vehicle traveling behind you, and our equipment.  We do however always offer a clean car guarantee and in cases like these another trip through the wash will take care of anything missed during the first run through.  If you are ever unsatisfied with your wash for any reason please always pull around and our team will let you go through again no questions asked.  We do apologize for the inconvenience and we hope to better serve you in the future.  OUr store leader would be happy to reach out directly to address any concerns or questions you have - please send your contact info to socialmedia@dontdrivedirty.com"}<//Resp>

Prior to Quick Quack opening here in Brentwood, I had watched a couple of you tube videos about there carwashes. Not the biggest fan of these type of carwash with the rotating brushes, and so forth but they have come along with the material they use as compared to the older ones.
So Quick Quack finally opens here in Brentwood, and I get a free wash coupon in the mail, so I decide I'm going to give them a try. 1st thing I'II say is this is a good location in my opinion, busy intersection with lots of housing, traffic, and other business's. Set up of this carwash is good. I pull into the vehicle entrance, and am greeted by a QQ employee. Show employee my free wash coupon. She does a walk around of my vehicle, and then proceeds to write on the windshield " 1" with the letters "TR" below that. I assume this is for the employee at the entrance to the wash to key in they type of wash. These type of carwashes basically have 3 basic rules - vehicle in neutral, foot off the break, and hands off the steering wheel. Carwash starts, all seems well until we get to the brush that is suppose to get the hood, windshield, and top of vehicle. Well, I wait and it never came down, so I'm left with a windshield full of bug splatter. Vehicle continues on through the rinse, tire shine, and air dryer. Not happy about the left over bug splatter, I inform one of the QQ employees what happened. I'm not mad or complaining but want them to know what happened. QQ employee offers another wash. I decline, letting him know what happened, thinking there may be mechanical issue. so when you exit wash, you can pull into the vacuum area. QQ offers free vacuums for you to use. So as I'm vacuuming my vehicle, another QQ employee comes over and informs me that the reason the brush did not do the hood, windshield, & top of vehicle was because my vehicle has a top rack, hence "TR" that has 2 braces that go "side to side". He explains that if I remove those 2 braces prior to going thru wash that brush would come down. the employee at the entrance of the wash, uses the code written on your windshield to program what kind of wash your getting. I have used a couple of other places that use this type of wash system, and I have never had an issue with my TR braces. Back to vacuums, they offer 2 types of vacuum nozzles - Crevice type for those hard to reach area's & a wide mouth type for your carpet and mats. Vacuums work well and provide good suction. They also offer an air hose for blowing out your console & dash area, I found the air pressure inadequate. The other issue, I noticed is that there " Tire Shine" did not apply. I checked numerous vehicle & found none of them had the "Tire Shine" applied. So in closing these are my thoughts -  1) overall wash was ok 2) if your top rack has cross bars that go "side to side" you need to remove 3) Tire Shine may or may not apply on that day 4) Vacuum works great 5) Air Hose is okay. So with that being said, it will be up to each individual to decide for themselves if QQ Carwash meets there needs. For me, I'm on the fence about it but love the Duck.<//Review>

<Text>Decent drive through but for the price I thought they would have carwash employees to dry and vacuum your car.

The monthly subscription isnt any better than other places.

The self service vacuums are pretty good and they have compressed air to blow out your cars cracks and arounds emblems / mirrors.

I'll bring a good towel with to properly dry it so I dont leave water spots.

Employees were nice but didnt offer much of any details on the free month coupon I had.

After signing up for the monthly subscription in found out if I dont like it and want to cancel before 45 days (after you pay the second month) it's a $5 charge.

The free trial isnt free.  At least the $1 processing fee and the $5 cancel fee is less than one car wash.

It's more of a discounted month than free.

I'll try it for a month and see how it goes.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1618064771486, 'text': 'Thank you, Jason 328D!  We appreciate the review.

{'time': 1620237164148, 'text': 'Hello Cindy - thank you for taking the time to review.  We do utilize an incredible RO system to prevent water spots.  If your vehicle had water spots previously on your vehicle it would depend on how hard the water wash when it dried in order to remove.  We must take care in all of our dilution ratios, as every vehicle has a variation in their clear coat (the older the vehicle the thinner the clear coat). However, the more you apply a cleaning solution followed by a wax, the more hard water spots will dissipate. I invite you to take advantage of the “clean car guarantee”, where washing it twice may be exactly what is needed.'}</Response>

Makala, the asst. Mgr grabs a broom, drops the tailgate, jumps up in the bed of the truck and sweeps out some leaves from the bed. That is some awesome service.

<review>The quality of KFC has degraded so much in the USA. Back in India, the KFCs are much better as they are newer with better service. The food here was okay for the price. They could really improve the quality.< /review>< userid>

Kind staff. Good patience even with rude customers. A woman came in screaming, demanding food and the cashier kept his composure and stayed calm. I was extremely impressed.<//review>

< Review>
They take so long and every time I go there's a different group of new workers they need better training because there were like 4 people in kfc shirts but only one taking orders and making food everyone else was acting busy meaning sweeping or refilling toppings for taco bell. I was mad waited 20 minutes for a family fill up. This girl was doing the drive through but was talking SUPER LOUD like shut up and work</Review>

Love the Colonel’s chicken. It’s finger lickin good. When I was at this location, I thought I was on the movie set for The Klumps with Eddie Murphy. There was a family there eating Fried Chicken and all the fixings and they were blowing out the loudest and stinkiest farts. The older woman said “oh, my baby got gas.” The farts were so bad I had to get my food to go.<//Review>

<Text>I have been eating KFC since the 60's and the quality, taste,size of items are much smaller. I feel this location could use a facelift, a new soda dispenser.  The staff is very nice and they always make me feel welcome. They also are part Taco Bell so there selection is limited.< /Text>< Pics>

KFC & Taco Bell share the same facility. It a combination of both. So if your in the mood for fried chicken and tacos, your in for a treat. I'm not a big fan of KFC. Its San Francisco, there are better places to eat than fast food for the same price.  This is just my preference. Its not a bad place, its just not for me because I dont like supper salty sodium processed food. Its only fair to give 3 stars based on cleanliness and service. Be sure to be nice to the people who work there. Sometimes their having a bad day and need someone smile at them and ask how they are doing.</Text>

For me, the convenience of the parking lot is a big plus.  Other than that, this is a pretty standard combination KFC/Taco Bell.< /Text>

Came here around 5 pm. It's a joint of KFC and Taco bells store. The sitting area is quite small. There are only 3 tables. I'm order 3 PCs chicken combo. The food is ready before my soda was filled up. The chicken, fries and the mashed potatoes are all hot. There is a parking lot in front of the store which is hard to find in San Francisco.< /text>

The service was nice however they gave me the oldest burnt crusty red chicken that I had ever had at any KFC. So I do NOT recommend this location.<//text>

This lady cares for your dog. The costs are reasonable and her work is great. Will definitely be a return customer. Also, there is a cool little space for the dogs to socialize in between going to the back at drop off and getting picked up. Gidget met Timber when we went.< /Text>

I first visited Pawradise Grooming in 2020, while I was staying in the area due to the pandemic. Since then, I've moved full-time to San Diego but made the trek back up to Yorba Linda just to bring my dog to this groomer. Every time we go our expectations are exceeded and my dog's hair is cut perfectly. To boot, the prices are reasonable and everyone who works there is super friendly. 10/10 would recommend.<//Text>

<review>Best place to take your dog for grooming! They do such a great job! We bring our two dogs there and they love it. They are very gentle with the dogs and the price is right. $30 for wash, clipped nails, ear cleaning and anal gland clean. They also give the dogs free bandannas, how cute is that.< /review></record>

This is a by appointment groomer who is cage free and has daycare available. Check out their website and go for a consultation with one of their award winning groomers. They know all their fur-clients by name and take good care about their name.< /Text>

<text>False advertising on their prices.  They completely overcharge what is quoted.  I was a loyal client for 6 months and come every 4-6 weeks for different services for two Goldendoodles.  Most of the services I paid $280 total ($140 each). When I started questioning the pricing, ($75 each for bath only) they wouldn’t make it right with me.  They just blamed it on their bad English skills for quoting wrong prices.   Shame on me for wasting money and not questioning them sooner.< /text>< Pics>

Took our pup there once and I’ll be a dedicated continuous costumer. My dog looked great but the part that stood out for me was the evident care she received. The owner seems to truly care and like the animals he services. I’d definitely recommend this place for your fur baby<//Review>

The prices for the services and food seemed a bit higher than regular pet stores. But you get what you pay for. Happy to pay more for better service and healthier options for Buddy.< /text>

Peter is a Pro, plain and simple. It took him hours to correct the the mistakes the "other" groomer caused. Result? Absolute perfection for my Newfoundland Carly. I cant thank him enough, and now I wont go to anyone else.< /text>

Love how they treat my Westie! The grooming is fabulous and my dog looks super white! After the dogs are groomed, they are placed in an open area instead of kennels. I appreciate that I'm notified when my dog is ready.  Excellent customer service!!!<//Review>

<review>I was so impressed with Pawradise Grooming, they are extremely talented.  For all the years I have been taking my dog to groomers, this was the most impressive for many reasons.  Guinness' haircut was stunning! He is 15 years old and he looked like a puppy again. They also took a picture of my most happy dog, and sent it in a text to say he was ready for pick-up.   It put a huge smile on my face!  To top it off they even checked with me the next day to see how Guinness was doing.  I urge you to try this grooming team - I know you won't be disappointed.  Thank you again Pawradise Grooming, I am looking forward to seeing you time and time again and telling everyone I know.  Jill Mejia<//review><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I am so impressed with Peter's talent as he cut my two shitzus. I emailed him pictures of cuts I wanted my dogs to have, and he groomed them impeccably! Customer service is top notch! Peter emailed me pictures of my dogs to see if I was satisfied. I wish I knew about him when I had my toy poodle. 💜🐶🐩< /Text>

<Text>This place will be my puppy's life time groomers!! I went to other groomers  before but I was never satisfied.. However, Peter did such a good job and I have no complaints at all. My 11 months old bichon puppy looked completely different after grooming and he wasn't stressed at all 😀. Peter is so professional and he cares about my puppy as much as I care about him. I highly recommend this place and I will be a regular customer from now on 😁.</Text>< Pictures>

Pawradise was referred to me by my veterinarian, the beautiful, awesome, and kindhearted Dr. Yasso. Pawradise is the absolute BEST groomer. I changed 3 groomers to finally have found the best!!! They text me afterwards to find out if my LiLi is doing well. I love how they follow up and how concerned they are for our furbabies. You won't regret taking your lovebugs to them. The owner, Peter, is super nice and Mike at the front desk, is also very kind and caring. I appreciate the great attention they all paid to my girl. Thank you Pawradise!!!!<//Review>

{'time': 1497631169016, 'text': 'Hi Ms. Hatcher, I\'m sorry if you felt that way.  We try hard to make all our clients satisfied but unfortunate things happen.  If we knew Rambo had any knicks from clipper, we would have told you without a doubt.  Sometimes, groomer can miss or some scars show up later which is why we send text messages afterwards to make sure every dogs we work with are okay.  When I texted you the following Monday, you replied "Thank you Mike for the services! Rambo is doing great, he is so much happier! I\'m sorry if he was being difficult for you. I know he was a big project but he looks so much better & i will definitely be a returning customer!" If you mentioned anything about his knicks, we would have done whatever was appropriate.  It feels bad to lose clients and it is sad to know a dog was injured because of us.  We will try harder to prevent any incidents like this.  Once again, I appoligize for what happened and hope Rambo is okay.\n\nMike.'}<//Response>

I have a message to McLaren Beverly Hills - don't judge or you may regret it later. I made an appointment over the phone the day before to come view the cars. When I showed up, I felt I was invisible. It took quite a while for somebody to finally acknowledge my presence and to say 'hello'. Meanwhile, they were offering water to the all the other customers there (except me). Surprisingly, all the sales associates were very busy and I continued to wait. One salesperson said he was very busy because he had to wrap a present for Bentley. Others just disappeared. One salesperson finally came up and showed me the button to open the door but he said all the cars were locked and there were no keys so I wouldn't be able to peek inside. I told him not to ever assume about a customer and I walked out.<//Text>

<review>Y’all should work on your customer service better. Many of us are in the market for a car and can purchase it and have it shipped from other markets. Mr Lee, I’m very disappointed in how your responses were. It is not becoming of any one in the asian community and shows much disrespect. You sell a nice car, but there are many nicer cars out there and you should be considerate of that.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b956bd2fdd65:0x5110d33572fea46b<//GmapID></record>

They may sell expensive cars but staff here don't know it's legal to record anything from a public sidewalk, road or alley. Especially this young guy who said "you can't record me, it's illegal" Second guy in the suit thinks it's OK to grab someone's camera. That IS illegal, it's called battery.</Text>

One of my all time favorite places to go. If you love fast cars or just want to see something nice, the Auto Gallery is the place to go. If you are a photographer they welcome you with open arms.</Text>

Friendly staff but didn't take me seriously as a customer. Joe Van De Veere told me he would text me his contact information after we got off the phone but never did. When I arrived at the store for the test drive, Joe completely forgot which cars I was considering, as well as the color I was interested in. I would much rather do business at McLaren Scottsdale.< /Text>

I called this place and spoke with Beau and he was very helpful and got me in contact with one of their service advisors Brad Koulback. Brad is awesome. He always responded quickly and provided as much information as he could with all the questions I had about the cars. He guided me through buying the perfect Mclaren!<//text></record>

Worst car dealer worst service ever I purchased a 2011 maserati quattro porte 2 months ago with extended warranty the next day I called them I told them that the car has noise in the front right wheel also light switch broken and other things they told me don't worry you have warranty so I take the car to Sacramento maserati because I live in  the area but after 2 days the dealer called me and told me the the warranty it doesn't cover because it was existing problem so I have to pay them from my own packet long short story I called the auto gallery but at the end they told me they can't do anything so they lie to me ...to every one don't buy any car from this dealer because they will lie to you... any way I'm going to take them to court<//Review>

Attention Linda and Drew. We have been residents of Santa Clarita for many years now, but we live closer to the Ralphs in Granary Square. As we were heading back from Los Angeles yesterday, 4/15/2021 - we decided to go to the Stevenson Ranch Ralphs location before heading home. As we walked in we noted that the store was in great order and also the COVID19 guidelines were in place.

I noted that the store was clean and much larger than the location we go to most often.

There was an item that was not on the shelf, so I waived down Drew and asked him if there was any more of this product. He treated me as if I was his only customer and told me he would check. While he was gone, we had changed positions in the store, as we were continuing to shop.

About 10 minutes later, as we had made it to the other side of the store, Drew found us. He had been searching isle by isle. His conscientious demeanor was incredible. He was also attentive and explained that they were out now, however - there were other options as he gave me those.

Drew should be commended on his ability to get the job done as well as his ability to bag groceries the right way, as I was taught when I was his age.

At checkout we were Blessed to have met Linda. She was a breath of fresh air, she was friendly and made us feel as we have been coming to this Ralphs location as often as we visit the Granary location. She also commented on how we were holding hands - that of course made the both of us gush over with happiness that someone would take the time to notice, let alone comment.

Linda and Drew are both Blessings to the Ralphs in Stevenson Ranch. I hope they get commended because we are now going to make this store our primary shopping location.</text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>This store is trash. Went for a a WesternUnion transaction that I do every month, and the manager tried to tell me it’s done another way. He simply hadn’t done it often enough, and didn’t feel like doing it. This is second bad experience. They carry almost no organic frozen products, no vegan non-dairy yogurt options, hardly any decent vegan options at all. Bottom of the barrel when it comes to grocery stores. Will never go back.< /review>< Pics>

I love shopping here always very friendly and professional staff, large range of products at a great prices. These supermarkets are always clean and tidy.
I have a Ralph's reward card I would recommend anyone to get one even if you are traveling from overseas. With the rewards card you can save a lot of money.< /review>

This Ralphs consistently offers a great selection of groceries at surprisingly low prices - in many cases beating the local Walmart for many products. The service here is also consistently friendly/ good and the bakery here produces some of the best croissants around!< /review>

The place is clean, neat, staff are polite. The only I would really see them changing is the way they pack your products. I enjoy doing it my self because if I let them to do instead buying a bag of crackers I will get a bag of crumbs😯. Packing cold, frozen products with a pack of sugar not cool😢< /Text>

I overheard one of the ladies on the night shift say a racial slur to her coworker as I was walking out thinking that I would not hear her.. I don't know the name of the lady who said the slur but she was an older white lady with blonde hair, the lady she was working with name is Della or something of that sort.. NEVER SHOP HERE!

<rate>2<//rate><Review>I used to shop here frequently, but after my experience on February 28th that will change. As I walked up to check out the manager yelled passed me multiple times without even acknowledging that I was a paying customer right in front of her. She was yelling to a man using the coinstar machine by the floral department and telling him that he would have to come back. The reason being that she didn't have the $400 he needed because she only had a couple hundred in the registers at the time. Mind you the only reason I know any of this is because she was literally yelling it passed me to the man behind me. I tried to scan my Ralph's card at which point she told me the total; the first interaction she had with me since I arrived. However, the card didn't go through and she ignored me trying to tell her as she was still yelling PASSED me to the man behind me. My reciept says the cashiers name was Linda D. So if you want to be treated like you don't exist by Linda while she screams to man about the contents of the store's cash registers, then come to this location!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Great People in the Meat Dept & the Produce Dept!!! Really every team member in this store is friendly and helpful, but the Managers and team in the Meat & Produce Dept go out of their way to be helpful every week.  Today I spoke to the Meat Manager abt my Beef Bacon costing more than filet mignon!  He immediately created a "sale" just for me.  Thank you so much! In the Produce Dept they are very informative and will cut up fruit for sampling.  The cashiers are always friendly and add to my day.  Thank you Ralph's for creating such a great place to shop!< /review>

<review>I was browsing the store at around 10:40 when I see Barbara gesture in my direction, talking of my brother and I while we shopped. She said something about us being out late at night and said "their parents must be proud" I was also looking through the reviews and saw that the same described woman (Barbara) had made a racial slur and an African-American gentleman.</review>< pics>

< Review>
This is a great store in an expensive area of Stevenson Ranch. The prices are actually slightly lower than other Ralphs in S.C Valley area believe it or not. The staff here are helpful & friendly. The only downside is the store is located in L.A County; not part of S.C city, so you will have to pay for grocery bags. They do have stuff on clearance (almost expired) at killer discount. So, I dont care what others say about expired items. So what? Nobody will die because of expired food. LOL<//Review>

I've been shopping here for more than 10 years. Store is fairly clean, prices are relatively fair most of the time....pretty great store. BUT JESUS EFFING CHRIST THE CASHIERS NEED TO STOP COMMENTING ON MY PURCHASES! It makes shopping so awkward. They also need to do something about the solicitors camping the doorway. Sometimes they camp both doorways so you cant politely refuse by going the other way. I dont need the guilt trip, Girl Scouts! I just want some some milk and eggs!</Review>

The majority of the people working at this Ralph's live in the area so they know what you want and they take very good care of everyone.</Text>

This is a great store in an expensive area of Stevenson Ranch. The prices are actually slightly lower than other Ralphs in S.C Valley area believe it or not. The staff here are helpful & friendly. The only downside is the store is located in L.A County; not part of S.C city, so you will have to pay for grocery bags. They do have stuff on clearance (almost expired) at killer discount. So, I dont care what others say about expired items. So what? Nobody will die because of expired food. LOL<//text>

I am going to miss RALPHS at Stevenson Ranch. I moved to the area for a year and shopped there almost every single day. Everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful. The store was always clean and well stocked. The manager is a real nice guy. The staff at the inside USBank are great people. My only suggestion to RALPHS (in general) is that they start carrying frozen falafel balls and reduce the sugar soda and chip section because all of that stuff is unhealthy. Also, every RALPHS should offer fresh sushi. Knit picking aside, RALPHS Stevenson Ranch gets 100 Golden Stars in my book !!!   :)</review>

When I need a specialty item or an item I need only Ralph's carries then I shop there. Otherwise, I buy my groceries from Aldi because Ralph's is a bit pricey for my budget.<//text>

I live close by and almost always get gas here. The clerks are always friendly and usually there is no waiting to get a pump. They also have a good selection of snacks and drinks...sometimes you can get a good deal on household items such as toilet paper, detergent, pet food etc.I almost forgot the important thing...the gas prices are always lower than other places around here!!</Text>

<Text>I have lived near this store most of my life and each time I've gone in there I am reminded why I take my business elsewhere. They are always rude and treat me as if I am an annoyance especially if you ask a question or need anything that can only be purchased from behind the counter (i.e. cigarettes, scratchers/lottery tickets, etc.). When I paid by ATM and got cash back he was very impolite about refusing to break down a $20 bill into ANYTHING smaller. I understand that people are just having a bad day sometimes but this is ridiculous.<//Text>< GmapID>

My family gets our fishing license here every year. All kinds of bait and tackel. Snacks for days. Gas prices are reasonable.</text>

The return staff was rude. They charged an extra day because their parking lot was full and we were unable to return the car with the drop box on Sunday.
The girl walked away when we were talking to her and refused to give us a receipt.</review>

I first learned of this Enterprise location from a neighbor. He recommended that I try this branch as he has rented from it several times. Now I’ve rented from this same office four times and have always been pleased with the service. It’s a busy small storefront that cycles a lot rentals, but its convenient location makes up for that. And despite the attendant presssures, Jose and his personable staff always do their best to accommodate everyone, including shuttling you to and from the branch when a staff person is free.
On the one occasion when I did have a small complaint with the vehicle, Jose handled it quickly and professionally.
Also, the vehicles have always been newer models with relatively few miles. So that’s always nice.
I will always call this location first when in need of a rental car.

Thanks, guys.

Great service (hence the 2nd star). However, they saddled me with a "non-smoking" car that was apparently previously occupied by a chain smoker, and then filled with Fabreeze to cover it up. At the end of the day my clothes smell like smoke and people are asking me if I took up smoking. Disgusting. I have no doubt that they would change it out for me, but I do not have the time and am not in the area often. When specifically requesting a non-smoking car, they needed to consider what they give out. Two little "No Smoking" signs in the car do not magically turn it clean.</Text>

I just had a “Twighlight Zone” episode play out at this Enterpise branch.

I dropped off a vehicle that I had rented.
After my wife and I got home we received a call from the branch manager, Jose Guadarrama, who signed me out when I picked up he vehicle. He proceeded to tell me that there was damage on the rear bumper.

To my complete and utter shock I drove back to the branch to see what he was talking about. I come to find out that the damage in question was on the back quarter panel. Someone had done some pretty amateur body work on the car, and I was being blamed for it.

If it had been me I would have happily made the claim on my insurance, or paid for it outright. I would not have gone to the trouble of covering it up with my own body work. I wouldn’t even know how to begin to do any kind of body work.

Jose stopped short of calling me liar by saying that the car was perfectly fine when I took the vehicle.

I ask future customers. If you were doing a walk through on a car would you point out body work that wasn’t the best body work in world? Would you think to? Would you even be looking for that?— I highly doubt it!!!

This felt terrible. As if I’m some kind of cheat or lair. My parents raised me better than that!

I’ve always been a loyal Enterprise customer. And was happy to learn that there was a branch near my house. Sadly I will never be using Enterprise again.

Again, I ask would you notice this on a walk through? NO - you wouldn’t!!! If they wanted to do poor body work on their vehicles is that your business.<//text>

Fabulous service...EVERY time. They always have a car, and time to rent takes much less time than Thousand Oaks Blvd location. Staff is personable and professional. Other locations should take lessons from this branch!

Update: when new branch mgr came in around 2-3 months ago, I dont rent there anymore, not customer friendly and 2 cars that came to pick me up wreaked of smoke. Mgrs excuse was we cant take cars off the line because they smell like smoke it would be too expensive for company. Guess they dont care about customer health!< /Text>

Reservation made more than 3 weeks in advance. Arrive to find there were no cars available. Driven to another location where no cars in the class I reserved were available. Offered truck or small car. Smaller car dirty. Told to drive to car wash by myself! Wasted about 2-3 hours with this adventure.< /Text>

<text>I wanted to rent a car for two days. I called Enterprise and arrived at their car rental location in Thousand Oaks. They told me that they didn't have cars left, so they persuaded me to rent a Ford truck. I took the truck and the next day I returned the truck to LAX airport, which was the agreement. We flew out of LAX that evening for Florida. A week later I received an e-mail from the girl who persuaded me to rent the truck, saying that the vehicle had not been returned and to please call her in the morning to update the status, as she did not want to charge me more than what was on the agreement. I tried calling the next day The voice mail said, "the # you are trying to reach can't reached right now ,try it later. "After two days of worrying. I called Enterprise headquarters and gave them the receipt information for the time the vehicle was returned at LAX. I was told the vehicle had been returned and the person connected me to the girl who rented me the truck. I spoke to her and she said it was a computer glitch. She had me worried for two days for nothing and when I tried to call her back I couldn't reach her. She deliberately called me and made herself unavailable. I think that she should not have that job. I will never rent a car from Enterprise again.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1498065750502, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Ben Kaya.

I had a small spa (5x7) removed, 2 concrete footings and a wicker cafe' set 2 small chairs and a small table. The fellows called to come early which I was fine with.  I had some issues with moving a boat which was blocked by a rental truck which I have as yet to find the key's?  Together we managed a work around and the cost was fair.  Allen and his a associate were great to work with did the job in a timely many and  communicated well.  I would recommend them to anyone, in fact I already informed a neighbor about your services.  Thanks<//text>

These guys showed up about 3 minutes after I made my appointment as they were already in the area. They were able to pick up all the excess junk we had in our warehouse yard and they were so friendly and helpful. Greatly appreciated, will probably call them again for any future needs!< /Text>

<text>Overall great service for the price. I had a lot of trash that I needed gone. I set an appointment online. They responded promptly, and in no time had and old torn down shed and other misc items loaded up and taken away. It was a hefty bill, but worth the time and energy saved taking it to the dump in a couple trips myself. I would recommend this company to anyone.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Hired them to help get rid of some older furniture I wanted to get rid of between moves. Fantastic service! Very good communication via the phone, got in and gave me an estimate, then had everything out 15 mins later. Beyond worth the hassle of getting a truck and hauling everything to the dump on my own. Will be looking forward to using them in the future! Thanks again!<//text>< Time>

I called to get an estimate, they said they’d send someone for free and take the items same day if I agreed with the pricing. Within 20 minutes they were at my home. They gave me an excellent price and got everything out (which was a good bit) within probably 10-15 minutes. Super nice and friendly, very professional. 100% would recommend!!!</Review>

They called me ahead of time let me know how far out they were then showed up in the specified time gave me a consult on what I had to have removed and when I decided I did not want to spend as much as it was going to cost there was no hard sell I asked about leaving some of the things that were hard to dispose of and for them just to tae the stuff that was really making my property look bad and taking up to much space and we came to a fair price. I will absolutely call these guys for the next removal great experience.< /Review>

<text>Called to have a standing 9 cubic ft. freezer removed from our 2nd floor apartment as it had gone out while out of town for the weekend. As one could imagine, the oder was unbearable to deal with,  I did the best I could. I called Junk King in hopes for a quick removal and was pleased to be given an appointment first thing in the morning. The professional gentleman called a half hour before the window time and offered to remove the freezer sooner.  I was told that ALL food must be removed prior to pickup, so I  was hesitant to the new time explaining that I  had my family stay in a hotel until the smelly freezer was gone and that I  had to remove the remaining food. The gentleman was happy to help with the situation and offered to take the freezer out as is and will remove the food for me. I am more than happy with this company and will call them for anything else I need removed in the future. The price was well worth it and we paid more for the trouble of dealing with the food.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Little more expensive than I was anticipating (1/4 truck was $278), but worth all the trash being removed from my side yard! It was a ton of household trash and broken junk that’s been piling up for months. They were so great and  very professional.<//review>

< Review>
The epitome of great customer service! It was “one of those days” and Junk King came through exponentially. I was scatter brained because there was so much going on, the guy on the phone had to explain everything probably 3 times. He did so patiently and with so much regard and respect. He helped me understand the pricing especially because I needed to stay within a certain budget. We hung up and he set up my appointment. Pricing was very fair.  The drivers (I think) called me immediately with an opening to pick up right away. I wasn’t there but planned to meet them. They got there before I did and patiently waited about 15min for me. They got everything up and out in a jiffy, took card on the spot and were gone. David & Allen were their names, super duper patient and helpful. Thank you guys so much!!!! I will DEFINITELY use you again!</Review>

WOW!! Outstanding!! These guys were Kind, ON TIME (yea you heard me right), and quick. I moved to the area and needed them to come and take away some carpet that I removed from the house. They showed up the same day I placed the order, took care of everything, came and got me when the job was done (really fast). I highly recommend them, my friend told me about them great tip, now I'm passing it along to you.</text>

Junk King was extremely professional and easy to work with – from my initial phone call, to setting up an appointment for the same week, to the gentlemen who showed up and did a fantastic job of clearing our items. I was particularly happy to receive a call from Junk King several hours in advance of our scheduled time offering to arrive earlier if it was convenient for us. It was a big help, and the guys were both friendly and efficient. I've used another junk haul company before, but I was far more satisfied with this experience. I'll go directly to Junk King from now on!< /text>

Starting with the super easy appointment process online, the email confirmation and reminder notice, a friendly 30 minute call ahead, up through the on time arrival and friendly pick up drivers, the entire thing was flawless.  AND...it cost less than I was expecting.  It doesn’t get much better than that.  I will never use anyone else.</Review>< Pics>

<Date>1598748379309</Date><review>We had a full truck load worth of boxes, furniture and just junk.  Took 15 to 20 minutes for them to load it all up.  It was easy and quick to make a reservation, the gentlemen that showed up were professional, quick and very knowledgeable (we had no idea the back could come off the couch). The cost was also super reasonable.  With how much we had , we could have easily spent that amount just to rent the truck necessary to haul everything.  Will definitely recommend to friends and family and use again.<//review>< Resp>

The team called this morning as advertised, showed up on time, were very pleasant, quickly assessed what we had, quoted a price, and then got to work quickly.  They expertly loaded the truck and were so diligent and organized in their execution.  When completed they processed my credit card quickly.  Again, both were so friendly, easy to converse with, hardworking, and organized.  This is the first time I have used Junk King and will definitely use them again and congratulate you on the quality of your employees.<//review>

I had taken a tree down a couple weeks back and as a firefighter, got called back into work in the middle of the project leaving clippings, branches, and tree trunks on the side walk and the side of the street. Days turned to weeks to over a month and I got a call from the city. I searched these guys online and they were out the next day to give a very reasonable estimate and had the job done in about an hour. Would have taken me a dump truck rental and most the day. Instead they got the job done quickly and professionally allowing me to relax. I’ve had 6 days off in the last 3 months, being able to relax with my pregnant wife for a day before, for all I know, being gone for another couple months is worth any price and I feel like I got the better end of the deal. I have more projects coming up and will be using Junk King Sacramento again and highly recommend them.
To the two men who came out, I know it was hot and heavy work but you both were professional and kept smiles on your faces. Thank you both.

Alex and Alan were on time, called 15 minutes prior to coming to the destination, loaded everything filling up the truck in an orderly and space saving method. These men were professional from start to finish and they moved with such speed and coordination in collecting the requested items being removed that they made start to finish be done and gone in1 hour. Very impressed and will use these men if we can request them for future needs. We will call Junk King for any needs as they will give estimate without charge, that said, the price and their work is worth it!<//Text>

One thing I like is that they were highly communicative. They called me at the start of the time window to let me know when in the window they’d come, they texted me when they were 20 mins away, and were clear when they came to me what amount of the truck I’d need and had fair pricing. Highly recommend for the peace of mind they provide!< /review>

We scheduled our pick up online.  Everything went smoothly the day of.  They called about 30 minutes before the top of our scheduled time frame and said they were able to come in early.  Once they got here it took them about 5 minutes to break everything down.  I think they were in and out in less than 30 minutes.  Super friendly, super easy, highly recommend.<//text>

I used Junk King to remove a very heavy old piano.
There were very professional, showed up on time and removed the piano quickly. I would highly recommend them to anyone needing this type of service. I would definitely use them again.</Review>

Super thrilled with these guys. Was tired of looking at the ugly king size mattress in my garage. Made an appointment online for the next day, they called that morning to let me know they'd be there in 30-40min. They arrived promptly and were super friendly and courteous, asked if I was familiar with their service (I was not), they gave me a quick run down of their pricing and loaded up the truck. I will certainly be using these guys in the future.<//Review>

So I have to schedule another day to complete the job. The president of the company agreed to knock.off $100 off the second truck load for my being inconvenienced. That is why I gave the experience 4 stars. I will upgrade to 5 stars when the job is complete.
The team was very competent and worked hard under difficult circumstances. I actually like the service but I find it a bit on the expensive side. The estimated $600 job is going  to really cost me another $500.</Review>< UserId.>

Overall it was an ok experience the price was a lil different because they said they charge by how much room you stuff takes up on the truck the only thing I didn’t like was the price was ok until they charged me $40 to take a little bitty kid trampoline that only fit one kid in it at a time. But I’ll use them again the person was real nice and they got in and got out real quick. Thanks<//Review>

Junk King was excellent! They came,  they conquered, they went!
I got everything organized so they could remove the items easily. It took about 10 minutes. We will definitely use them again.< /Text>

Found them very easily on line and decided to give them a call. Very precessional and was able to get someone out to my house for a quote. Someone came to my house the very next day with a competitive quote and so we went with them. Highly recommended!  Thank you for making things so easy.</text>

We had a pretty substantial amount of broken up concrete from some backyard work that needed to be cleared.  I called and was given an appointment for the next day, with the option of starting the work immediately if the price was agreeable.  Two guys came out looked at the work, we negotiated the price and agreed to start work the following day.

A crew of four guys ended up coming out and knocked out the entire job in probably two hours.  They were all very friendly, very professional and dis a great job.  When they were all done, I was asked to check the work to make sure it was satisfactory.  They did a great job in very short order, I would definitely recommend them!< /Text>

Wow!
Great communication on a rescheduled.  Junk Kings arrived in perfect time of my schedule. The professional people were impressive for such an early pick up. The truck and equipment used made the removal of the refrigerator very easy and quick.

Worth the price, no complaints!!! Only regret is I wish I gave them a bigger tip.

<review>Excellent communication, ease of scheduling online and using the new text application made it a breeze. The two gentlemen that performed the extraction, David and Ryan, were pleasant and polite and very very efficient. I have used your services about 10 years ago that’s why I chose it again this time. Keep up the good work. If I need hauling  again I will certainly call Junk King.

The junk Kings were soo helpful and friendly and accommodating. I didn’t get their names but they easily lifted extremely heavy commercial refrigerators and other large metal equipments all with their own two hands! All for a reasonable price!  They’re quick and they respond quickly too. They picked up right away and gave us lots of time slots to choose from and gave us a call to let us know they were about 30-45 minutes away which was also very helpful. Overall, I recommend👍</text>

I had the best experience with Junk King! I called last night at almost 8pm and left a message to get a quote for some concrete that I had jackhammered to be removed. They called me the next morning and I made an appointment to have someone come out the same day (about 2pm-4pm, I was already happy at this point) and give me a quote in person. I asked when the soonest they would be able to actually come and remove everything and she said as soon as tomorrow. About 30mins later the guys called me and asked if they could come earlier and I said anytime would be fine, they came about 25mins later and gave me a VERY reasonable quote (other companies I contacted for a quote were ridiculously expensive) to remove all the concrete pieces AND if I wanted they could do the job right then! The two guys were very professional and worked fast. I was really impressed with Junk King overall. I will definitely use them again if I ever need anything hauled away.</Text>

<Review>Initially 2 people showed earlier than scheduled appointments and when they saw huge projection TV called for help from two other folks. With 4 people they got the job done . I will use them again. There was a mention of internet coupon but was not clear if it got applied at the end. Not five star as the attempted to throw over balcony when I warned not to touch railings.

<username>Gary Christensen< /username><review>I had called Junk King to remove and dispose of a hot tub from my back yard .  They were professional and efficient during all phases of the order, including the initial call to place the order, to the estimator visit the next day, and especially for the 3 member crew who came the following day.  The hot tub was gone from my yard in less than an hour.  Highly recommend.< /review><user>106123019547082609230</user>< Rate>

My experience with junk King was quite excellent and satisfying. The two medium build fellows who showed up at my door handled that piano as professionally as they are, no scratches and swiftly without incident and hefted that thing to the deck of the truck with great ease. They had good personalities and we shared some laughs. All around I rate it as great service</text>

<Review>Couldn’t be more impressed with Junk Kings! They arrived within the window, toward the end but I have nowhere to go during quarantine anyways, and got the job done quickly and efficiently! I was quoted a reasonable price based on the stuff I wanted them to remove, and they took it all away. Both men were very personable and friendly. Gave them a lemonade, because they worked hard in the heat, and sent them on their way! I would definitely recommend them to friends and use them again. Thank you!<//Review><user_id>118124797100707473291</user_id>< Pictures>

You guys did such an amazing job helping out my elderly parents clear out the side yard and random pieces of junk from around the house.  It was such a hot day and there were a lot of heavy brick pavers to move.  Much thanks and highly recommend Junk King!  Would 100% use this company again!< /Text>

The workers were so professional and friendly and fast! They never hesitated to say they would take away our "junk", which was a three-tiered  concrete (and a little metal) outdoor water fountain that weighed hundreds of pounds. They worked their tails  off! Another company came out the same day before Junk King, and the two workers just shook their heads and gave me an estimate, which was over double what we were charged by Junk King. I would recommend this company in a heartbeat!<//Text>

I called their business number and spoke with a company spokesperson who answered all my questions. A free estimate was scheduled, which included same-day service removal. The next day the service crew showed up within the allotted time frame. A fair and reasonable estimate was presented, my junk was removed, it was an easy process.< /Review>

Pickup was great; fast and easy, nice guys. Scheduling was a bit of a miscommunication. While originally told it would be a 2-hour window, which is standard, when I finally set up my date (based on new furniture delivery date), I asked if they could be there early am, like by 8:30. I was told that would be fine, we would be the first stop.
Day of, not so much. I called to relay which parking lot to use at my dad's apartment complex, and was told I had a 10-12 arrival window. This was a problem, because the new furniture was coming within a window that started at 8:45. It was taking away old couch before delivery of new. For my dad's senior apartment, where that's the only seating. Didn't want to leave him for 24 hours or more with no place to sit but his bed, and no room for a second couch!
But Junk Kings was able to divert a crew my way, they arrived before the new couch, and everything worked out. I would use them again, hopefully for a less complex situation...</Text>

<Text>The following includes two reviews of Junk King.  The first post is the most recent review dated May 19, 2020 and the second review was posted about 10 months ago.

Most Recent:

I had Junk King come out last year to remove most of the river rock in my backyard and was very impressed with their professionalism and work ethic.  I decided to have the rest of the rocks removed recently so made a call to Junk King last week (believe last Friday, May 8)

All aspects of the job went smooth from setting up the appointment, obtaining an estimate, and having a 4-person crew at my house on time to remove the rock.

The Company is well run.  Communication was excellent, the job was reasonably priced, and the owner and crew professional.  I would recommend this company to anyone.

10 months ago:
Excellent, professional customer service from start to finish.  I had several tons of river rocks, 60+ heavy concrete blocks and a lot of bricks to remove from my backyard.  I initiated communication Tuesday, received a favorable bid on Wednesday, and had the material removed today, Friday.  Work crew was on time, polite and hard working with no breaks.  Job was done in 1 1/2 hours.  Thank you Tao and the rest of the work crew.<//Text>< pictures>

Junk King did an amazing job! The gents,  Eddie and Eddie were hero's today! Their drive and determination created a client for life. I couldn't be more happy with the service we received today. 5 stars for Junk King and 6 stars for Eddie and Eddie!< /Text>

<Text>We're so impressed by the guys who hauled away our junk!! They worked so hard on cutting up our large spa, finagled a couch out the front door and a handful of other items, and cleaned up afterwards. They're on their way with a full haul to the dump now. I definitely recommend your service!!

It was Aaron and I'm afraid I can't remember the newbie's name (his 1st day!). So kind!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1594836535449, 'text': 'Thank you for the nice review Leslie!

While the price was a little higher than I was hoping to pay, it was definitely worth it! I had a 10’x10’ storage that they had cleaned out in about an hour. I’m very happy I went with Junk King. Thank you!<//Text>

<review>I was impressed from the minute I spoke to your receptionist she was efficient, fast and professional in scheduling my appointment the next day. I also was impressed with the employees that came to pick up my JUNK. They were courteous, efficient and professional as well. I will use JUNK KING over and over again and the price was very reasonable and I will most definitely refer you to my family and friends. Thank you!<//review>< Pictures>

The 2 guys that came out and got all the JUNK out from under my house were awesome! They were polite, professional and worked HARD. This is the second time I have used this service and I will not hesitate to use them again. I would definitely recommend them to friends and family who have a need for this kind of service. They didn't ask me about filling out a survey but I was so pleased with them that I felt it necessary to give them props beyond the extra tip I gave each of them for their hard work. If you are reading this fellas, thanks again!<//text>

I can't believe how easy and professional these guys are to deal with. I called yesterday before noon and they scheduled the debris pickup from my home the very next day. The guys Allen and Alex in Sacramento even called me to tell me they'd be early which worked out perfectly with my noontime lunch schedule so they were able to get the job done during my lunch break. Scheduling is really hard for this kind of thing when you are like mist people and have to be at your job during the day. The cost was completely reasonable and not excessive at all even with my heavy concrete debris, since they go by weight and volume at around 90-200 for a pickup sized load and they had it done in like 15 min. Would definitely recommend Junk Kings and will definitely use them again<//Review>

Best movers ever! They called before they arrived and it only took a few minutes to move my three piece sectional couches.
I would definitely recommend this business to others.<//text>

<Date>1583018640264</Date><Review>The workers showed up early and worked quickly. The price was far more expensive than other places. I paid 308 for 1/3 truck load but other local places I had quote for way more stuff to haul away and it was 300. I had prepped the smaller load in my driveway just to clear my garage thinking it would be cheaper, oh well. Overall good service and communication. You can pay by creditcard over the phone or cash so that is nice.<//Review>< rating>

They beat out 5 other junk removal/haul company prices by a large margin. They were professional and responsive when I was speaking to the owner within the Yelp messenger to get setup for my pickup and to go over pricing. The pick up crew came between the time window. My time window was between 2pm - 4pm and the crew came at 3pm. All I needed hauled out my house was an old ikea bed frame and a light mattress that went with the ikea bed set. Would recommend for next junk pick up!< /text>

Today Junk King not only responded quickly but also came a little early to give us the estimate and then came back and was friendly and was super quick- we are moving and had a LOT of junk. I recommend Junk King for all your junk removal!!!! Thank you Junk King and your wonderful team for not only making my families move more smooth but while doing it during this crazy and unsafe time!</Text>

One star for coming and getting the job done. Upon sending detailed pictures of the job, I was quoted $175 for the job by junk responders, so I asked junk king if they could do $175, they said yes so we scheduled a time for them to pick up. When it came time to pay I wanted to use a coupon to which they refused, even though there was no verbage on the coupon that said I couldn't use it, nor was I told at any point that I couldn't use it. The coupon simply said "$30 off any job, must present card, cannot be combined" so after an argument I just paid the $175 and let it go. Then as he left he said "some people are just cheap like that" well buddy $30 is $30 whether you are rich or poor. Moral of the story, don't try and use a coupon.< /text>

< review>
The West Sacramento area crew was very professional  and easy to work with. They provided an on-site estimate and was able to do the job the same day. Junk King relieved me of heavy lifting and sorting that would have been required if I went with a dumpster drop off service and they provided it at a comparable price!   I highly recommend them and will do business with them again.</review>

They came an hour early, and I still hasn't taken anything in or out of the furniture, but I made it.  There were two men, and they were courteous.  I was very happy that they took my huge, ugly entertainment center away and that big huge desk away.  Try did an excellent job!  Thank you, Junk King!<//Text>

For three years I've said "gotta get this stuff over to Snowline" and "maybe someone would buy this on Craig's List." But the stuff was really heavy, I couldn't move it alone, it wouldn't fit i my car, and I didn't want strangers coming to my house to look at/buy the stuff. Junk King will donate what is usable and recycle the rest.  For about $200, I freed up my garage and saved myself hundreds at the chiropractor. Thanks guys! You are the best!
(P.S. And they came when they said they would - on time!)< /Text>

I needed a short notice junk pick-up, and did not have any issue getting it.  The people who set up the appointment were very professional.

The employees contacted me and let me know when they would arrive.  They were very professional, and did a very efficient job removing the junk from my yard.

I highly recommend this company.< /review>

<text>I'm a property manager, and we often have furniture that needs to be removed from our site.  We've used Junk King for many years and they always schedule our jobs quickly, they call to let me know when they are on their way, and their prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend their services - thanks Junk King!</text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Great crew, great work, on time, on budget, neat, tidy, and quiet, with no surprises.

I called on Friday to inquire about removal of many large mounds of dirt, sod, gravel, and green waste that I had generated during a back yard remodel over many DIY weekends.

They came on Saturday to assess and provide an estimate. Accepting the estimate, we made an appointment for Monday morning.

On Monday morning, 3 guys came with all the equipment needed for the job. They shoveled and hauled my mounds out to their truck in short order, being careful of my newly planted landscaping!  Very agreeable in demeanor and noise level, and they did great work. I didn’t even have to oversee the operation, which I was expecting to do because there were so many details. They heard my request the first time and just did it right!

I highly recommend them and I’ll definitely use them again when I need removal of anything I can’t take away myself.< /text>< pics>

The guys were very professional and friendly, they called ahead and asked if they could arrive earlier than my scheduled 9am appointment. I can’t believe how fast and efficient they were, they were finished before 9am. I had their coupon and they applied the discount.... Their pricing was explained and the quote was right in my budget . I will use them again when the need comes up.</Text>

<review>Can't say enough Good things about this company.  We have used them where I work and for my own personal stuff (junk). So professional and courteous,  took whatever needed taking cleaned and swept up. They are the best!<//review></record>
</dataset><record>
<Text>I asked them specifically if they would donate the things left over from our estate sale when they called to confirm the appointment.  The man said yes, we'll bring two trucks, one for jumbo and one for donation.  On the day of the appointment one truck came, and they put our giant barrels to throw all of our glassware and dishes into.  I asked about the donation and they said they take it to recycle, that nobody wants this stuff anyway.  I was very sad at this news, but it was too late to do anything about it, so I went to run errands so I wouldn't need to watch.  My husband was there the entire time, and watched them throw everything away, all of the glasses and breakables were thrown into the barrels, obviously breaking.  They also took everything or of the cupboards and drawers which were marked "don't take" with signs.  They took the extras parts to to the stove (meat probe and griddle) and all of the manuals for the new homeowner.  They took my medicines and good that we were living on during the move.  I called several times along for a call back, Becca I wanted to be reimbursed for these things, and all them to take the donation from off of their advertising.  Finally I was sent to someone, who told me I was lying, and he knows I'm a list because he was there that day.  My husband then told him that I left before the second truck arrived, which he was in, and that everything I said was true because he heard it also.  He continued to argue, so u asked to speak to someone else.  He said the owner would call back, which never happen.  This company is super shady, with lies and no communications.  They don't feel bad at all saying they will donate, then tossing all of your stuff in a barrel to head off to the dump.  I'm sure they get double pays for all of the "recycling" of items that should have been donated.  Don't trust them!< /Text><user_name>Julie Vestal<//user_name>< UserId.>

During the move we did alot of purging and quickly realized that a lot of junk was piling up. It was a relief to know that it would be taken care of so we could focus on the move. The guys were excellent...

<text>I am completely impressed with my experience with Junk Kings. I was not expecting this to be a situation where I would encounter phenomenal customer service and professionalism. The driver called me to let me know he was in the area earlier than expected and asked permission to come early instead of just showing up. I appreciated that he made the effort to be sure I would be at the location. The truck was clean and the appropriate size for the job and both gentlemen were dressed in company t-shirts, very courteous and friendly, well spoken and hard workers. They were efficient in their approach to loading the variety of items and did not waste any time completing the job. Most importantly, I felt safe and was not apprehensive about letting them into my house. I will recommend Junk Kings to every one I know who is in need of such a service.

Junk King responded promptly and courteously to my telephone call and sent staff out that afternoon to give me a free estimate. They arrived when scheduled, were courteous and knowledgeable, and gave me a competitive estimate. The next day they called when they were on the way and completed the job promptly. Love the truck, too!!</Review>

The two men who came to pick up our junk arrived in a timely manner, were incredibly courteous and left the area very tidy!
The quote I was given was slightly higher than the price I paid in the end - always a plus!

I highly recommend the Junk King!< /text>

I would like to give the company 5 stars because the two men who came today did a wonderful job picking up our trash. They us with provided great customer service. Even though they were running behind slightly schedule for the day, they gave me a call ahead of time to let me know about how long it would be before they made it to my home. They gave us a reasonable price and were also very friendly, especially with my 3-year-old son who sometimes was playing and running around. I would also like to mention that we received a quote from another company; however, their professionalism was very lacking, so it was a nice surprise to see the two gentlemen that were sent to help us by Junk King going above and beyond to make sure that the job was done well. I would recommend this company to a friend. Thank you!!<//review>

I was very pleased with Junk King, the three guys were in and out. A little pricey for my pocket, because of course they went by weight. However, I needed the items removed and sometimes you have to pay the price if you want it done right. I would probably use them again in the future.<//Review>

<review>Amazing! I didn’t know what to expect admittedly. But I didn’t expect same day service, friendly customer service, convenient pay options, quick removal of all the garbage accumulated with our move within minutes and finally peace of mind; Which is what junk king delivered. I would definitely recommend.</review>< Pics>

<Review>My experience with Junk King was fantastic.  The online booking process was straight forward and easy to understand.  When the company representatives arrived, they were professional and courteous.  They removed my junk in no-time flat.  I would recommend this company to my friends in a heart beat.< /Review>< response>

Company is honest; gave quote but at the end it was less than quoted and gave me a very fair price.  Cleaned the area where the junk was.  The workers were very personable with a sense of humor.  This is my second time to use them and I will again as well as recommend them.  For sure.<//text>

These guys are great. Came same day. Even took a few empty paint buckets that I knew they probably wouldn’t/didn’t have to take. Price was a little steep but based on service it was worth every penny.< /review>

<text>I think the amount of material removed did not warrant the $78.00 charge. Unfortunately I had no alternative since I was leaving town the same afternoon.
Total amount of rubbish was less than half a car trunk full.

My advice shop around if you can before you commit. I took the advice of the Public Storage manager and would be more cautious in the future.  Shop around before you choose this company.</text>< Pictures>

< review>
Third time I have used Junk King. Just want to add, I have since lived a couple communities where illegal dumping is prevalent. I know many times customers who mean no harm hire some cheap junk remover. Then that remover pockets the money and dumps the haul illegally, usually in the country, small town or a low income neighborhood. It’s sad and it’s the customer who pays when their address is found in the pile of abandoned trash on old mail or boxes.

That’s why it’s best to hire professionals like Junk King to carry out your trash.  You solve your troubles without causing any in a near by community.

Junk King is so easy, quick and always professional. Their workers communicate very well. Will be hiring again! Thank you!< /review>

<review>Allen with Junk King was super friendly and professional. I over slept and missed there initial phone call but I called them back and Allen told me if they had room in the truck that they would come back. No less than 30 mins later he called me advising he would be on his way to pick up my items. Great customer service and Allen and his crew did a wonderful job. The whole crew is a asset to the company. I will definitely be using Junk King for all my future disposals</review><rating>5< /rating><user>103156552811879669742<//user><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x809ae7a7c39dc33f:0x697220ac4c5e5759<//GmapID><user_name>Rob Foltz<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I recently used Junk King to remove some old furniture from an upstairs apartment.  I would refer Junk King as being a great service and worth the money.  They are fast and efficient.  They will call ahead time to let you know they are coming and work with your schedule to provide a date and time that best suits your availability..  Junk King provides great customer service and a very friendly staff.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Pics>

These guys just took away an old couch of mine for $118. The appointment was easy to schedule on their website, and they arrived well within the appointment window. If you have something you need hauled away, I give Junk King Sacramento the highest possible recommendation.</Text>

They were very quick, professional and fair in price. I had a quote from another company and they negotiated with me to be comparable. They took every last bit of my large junk pile within 30 minutes! Their communication is unparalleled, calling 20 minutes before quote arrival and pickup as well. Excellent service and I would definitely recommend!< /review>

< Review>
Junk King was extremely fast. The drivers were very personable. The drivers were not able to pick up most of the products, because the truck ran out of room. The driver said he would be back today or the next day. The next day I went down to see if they had picked it up and they did. We would definitely use Junk King again.<//Review>

<review>Great experience with Junk King. They were extremely flexible, and changed our appointment twice at our request. The crew were great guys, who showed up early, performed a tough job with aplomb, followed instructions diligently, and by asking the right questions, saved us some big regrets by making judgment calls about junk vs. non-junk. I will recommend JK to anyone who needs to dejunkify themselves!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great service, Melissa on the phone was very helpful and gave me a great quote for the pick up. The pick up was scheduled for 3p-6p that day, but the movers called and asked if they could come by earlier around 1pm because they were in the area. Also, they take cash or card once they have moved your stuff, making it quick and easy for the customer. This was a great experience and I will remember to use this company again next time!< /text>

They removed a dishwasher, office chair, coffee table with drawers, and a car seat within 5 minutes! The price was super good! I also thought I left some dvds in the coffee table, so I called and they kindly pulled over and checked. I really appreciated that. I will be using them again!<//Review>< pictures>

They called within the window and let me know that they were running late. We didn't mind at all and I was impressed by the proactive communication from the team. When they came by a couple hours later they were professional, courteous and fast! My husband and I were so impressed and thankful for this service and will be sure to call if we ever need help again! Did I mention the considerate employee even gave us a discount and apologized for being late? This is clearly company that truly cares about customer experiences and empowers their employees to do their jobs well. My only regret is that I did not get the names of the guys that helped us out- but they should get raises and kudos!< /text>

<UserId.>102656208918286769343</UserId.><user_name>Zcotham X</user_name><Time>1341073232001<//Time><Rating>2</Rating><Text>Had appointment to pick up large junk pile as I am cleaning out home for sale. Appointment was between 1 and 3 pm. Driver called at 3 pm to tell me they were running late as they had two large jobs they didn't anticipate and will make the pick up around 4- 5 pm. Received second call around 5pm that the truck was full and they would not be able to complete the order that day. The driver offered another time next week but I cancelled. Either I'm in the wrong business as junk removal is doing quite well, or the folks at this JK office are in the wrong business because they can't handle their orders. Nice wasted day I couldn't afford. 1 star as the driver was a nice guy. Advice to JK: when you see an order will be larger than expected and you won't be able to make all the day's orders tell that particular client you'll have to come back another day or get a back up truck. Ah, there's an idea!<//Text>< Pictures>
