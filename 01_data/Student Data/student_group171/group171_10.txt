The office staff is so friendly and helpful, and Rachel, the dental hygienist does a wonderful job cleaning and caring for my teeth. She always advises me on how to improve my oral hygiene, which I truly appreciate. I also met Dr. Platts for the first time and he too is very nice and appears to be quite thorough.< /Text>

<review>Very honest and professional. My wife does not enjoy going to the Dentist but Dr. Platts always makes here feel comfortable whenever she sees him. They have a great staff and we feel like family when we come in for our annual visits. Would not go anywhere else for Dental work. Wish I could  give them more than just 5 stars. Keep up the great work!</review>< Pics>

I recently moved to the area from Northern Ca. I had anxiety in finding a new dentist That I could trust.  Gratefully, I was referred to Dr Dunn. I found his entire staff to be Pleasant, and the  Facility’s aesthetics were Pleasing and very clean. The treatment I received in the dental chair was painless and efficient. I felt I could express any concerns both during and in the future, if needed. I’ve already referred a dear friend to Dr. Dunn.< /Text>

< Review>
Dr. Dunn was our Family dentist many years ago when we lived in Hemet in the late 70's/80's. The crowns and bridge he did for me a lifetime ago, after 2 marriages and many moves are still in great shape.   Thank you Dr. Dunn.

Dunn and Platts is a five star dental practice! I used to have a fear of dentists, and dreaded going in for anything (cleaning, X-Rays, fillings, etc.), but a visit to Dr. Platts has never been painful or uncomfortable. His hygenist, Arlene is always pleasant, gentle with the tools, and does a great job. Getting dental work done has never been easier for me.< /text>

When you think about going to the dentist, it's pretty safe to say most everyone would agree they aren't fun thoughts. Well going to Dr Dunn & Platts takes most of that worry away for me. Amazingly gentle does a great job including the dental assistant. She has an amazing memory. And can recalls things that you wouldn't think are possible. And they both have great personalities. If you could "love going to the dentist" this place would be the place. I've needed a lot of work over the years and they have taken excellent care of me, and haven't had any issues with the work in the long term. I started going there in 2012 or 13 I will not go anywhere else.</text>

I have been going to this dental office for 28 years, and their service is wonderful!  They are efficient and friendly!  They always call and text to send me nice reminders. I get all my teeth cleanings and dental work done there. They have always been gently, kind, and very thoughtful with their treatments.  They get to know their clientele and treat you with respect. I highly recommend this Dental Office!< /review>

I couldn't be happier. I had a filling done and a a crown replacement done and I was out in under an hour and a half. The doctor is very communicative, so you always know what he's doing. Be sure to use their services if you live in the area and need to see a dentist.<//Text>

All I can say is WOW!!! Such a phenomenal, and outstanding staff! The second you walk through the doors you’re  welcomed with smiles! They make any procedure feel like a trip to DisneyLand! I would recommend the dentists and staff to everyone and anyone!! They make getting a tooth pulled as easy as counting to three ! If you’re looking for a new dentist I HIGHLY recommend this office! And if you already have one, ditch him and you won’t be disappointed!!!</review>

I’m an older person nearly older than dirt. I have had a lot of dental experience. Dr Dunn is the greatest always humming and talking to keep you calm. I have been a patient there for a couple years and would go no where else. His staff there is the greatest. Kind thoughtful and so very nice.<//Text>

I’ve been going to Dr. Dunn for about 10 years. The entire staff is excellent, friendly and professional. My hygienist, Gina, was thorough and gave me some new cleaning pointers.
I highly recommend this group.<//Review>

Dr. Dunn has been treating my teeth for nearly 20 years. His diagnoses have been invariably accurate. Repair work -- and I have needed a great deal of it, stemming from genetics, childhood neglect, inattention, or trauma -- has been reliable, with minimal time and discomfort. The office staff is competent, especially pleasant, and accommodating and flexible when appointments must be changed. I remain totally satisfied with Dr. Dunn and his hygienists.< /Review>

I've been coming here for many years now. This s a first rate dental practice. Dr. Dunn and Dr. Platts are  not only dentists they are artists with their work. I've had the same hygienist every 6 months since coming here since about 2007, She is best ! as are the dental assistants and the front office. Hemet is fortunate to have such great dental practice. Best photo I could generate. Bear in mind these teeth are 70 years old and all fronts are 100% original except a small chip repair on one of the uppers.</Text>

I'm always extremely pleased with the service I  receive at this dental office. The staff is always super friendly and helpful.  This visit was for my 6 month checkup. The dental hygienist was very efficient, knowledgeable,  professional, and friendly. Both she and Dr. Platts answered any questions I had. I highly recommend this office.</text>

Very friendly personnel and professional! Appreciate their follow up with me. Now...Dr Dunn is such a character! I appreciate his skilled dental work. He talks you through as he goes through procedures. His sense of humor helps a lot! He makes sure communication between patient and doctor is a priority.  His assistants all follow his lead.<//review>

Just had my first root canal done here. I didn’t know what to expect but everyone was very calming and polite as always. I can’t say enough good things about the doctors and their staff. I’ve had fillings, caps and then this. Always nice and unbelievably friendly. I’m just saying if these aren’t your dentist you probably have the wrong ones. It’s like your parents always say you are the company you keep and I like keeping my teeth!<//text>

I came to Dunn & Platts Dental after almost 5 years of no dental care. Their staff was very understanding and accommodating of my situation, quickly got me in for an initial consultation and a cleaning to follow. My biggest fear of going back to the dentist after such a long time was the potential shaming and disappointment I would get from a dentistry team, however, Dr. Platts and their entire office staff have been very welcoming and have never made me feel ashamed for neglecting my oral health. They have been very kind and are only interested in getting my teeth back to a good clean state and back on track!

In the few fillings I have had done, Dr. Platts and the assistants were very attentive to my comfort, they certainly put my fears of pain aside by ensuring I had enough anesthetic and talking me through each step of the process. As a person who has dreaded and feared going to the dentist, I would highly recommend this office for anyone needing high quality, compassionate dental care.<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I had been a patient of Dr. Dunn for approximately six years and honestly, I've felt uncomfortable on several occasions with their approach..... Sort like a unspoken discrimination type of vibe from particular staff members. Perhaps, there aren't too many people of color that visit this office, because it sure feels like distance in their attitudes towards someone of color. Although, I have dual dental coverage, I often felt like I didn't really belong there by staff. I also noticed that Dr. Dunn is somewhat in a hurry on most occasions and he was most interested in how much money he can make in a day, especially from crown and bridge procedures. I must say the hygienists are pleasant and gentle.< /review><user_name>Renee Henry< /user_name><Rating>1</Rating>< pics>

<Name>Shaul Rosen-Rager</Name><review>Sometimes you just get lucky.  I have had 6 or 7 GP doctors since moving to Hemet in '96, but only one dentist. Dr. Dunn have been taking care of my teeth for over 20 years. He is a second generation in the Dunn dental dynasty, and must have started when he was 12 because he was already very good when he joined his father Heber ( it was Dunn and Dunn back then.) Dr. Dunn stands behind his work and practically gives a "lifetime warranty" on his dental work. He has a great sense of humor, and always explains the procedure and the different options available.  He is patient and kind, always sensitive to my needs and my tolerance for pain (I have none).
I also love visiting twice yearly the kind and talented dental hygienist Arlene, who's very gentle yet thorough, and doesn't berate me for forgetting to floss under the bridge. But I really shouldn't tell you about her... she is so good, it's already hard to get appointments with her.
Then there's Tayla and the office staff, always friendly, diligently checking with the insurance company and making sure that the estimates, deductables and whatnots are always accurate, so you don't get a surprise bill after the fact. What a team!
Thank you, Team Dunn and Platts! You are the best!</review>< response>

I’ve been going to Dr. Dunn in Hemet for almost 3 years, but I stayed with Heber Dunn in idyllwild about 6 years ago.  I’m living in L.A. now and I still drive to Hemet to have Karina do my cleanings. She’s awesome! I love the office staff. They’re always super nice and make sure you have appointments scheduled ahead because they book up so fast.  If you’re looking for a dentist in either Idyllwild or Hemet, I highly recommend them!<//review>

< Review>
Very clean, polite, low key & professional office & staff.  Quiet atmosphere when I was there, peaceful, like I feel in some churches.  Doctor was very insightful & offered a few different scenarios for my case.  Very gentle.
1-10-2020:  Update; I just went in again and they had a nice little heater out of the way of patients in the foyer that looks like a fireplace, very cozy and warm!  They truly do care about their patients experience here as I had a very complex problem that arose from a "chain" dentist office in town that was trying to make me do more work than I needed.  Glad I did some research and especially glad Dr. Platts was able to solve the issue for a considerable amount less and very little time too!
Very gentle doctor and I hope to see them again on my semi-yearly visit to Hemet!  THAT says alot as I've suffered from Dental Anxiety for a very long time!<//Review>

< Review>
I especially like the way you keep the appointment in front of the patient via text messages. That's very helpful to an old guy like me who is forgetful at best. I have been called to the back within a few short minutes of signing in on my visits there, preventing one of my pet peeves of being left in the waiting room for a period of time. These folks seem to understand that an appointment is an appointment and not a time to leave the patient sitting in the waiting room to grow anxious. On my first visit, I had a totally painless extraction by Dr. Dunn. His post-extraction directions were spot-on and I experienced zero pain or discomfort until the gum healed over. In short, these folks "get it".</Review>

My husband and I moved to the area in 2011 and found Dunn and Platts due to a recommendation from a health professional in Hemet. After living over 30 years in large urban areas, we think that Dr. Dunn is the best dentist we've ever had. He's very knowledgeable on a wide variety of  dental problems; he explains things clearly and without having to be asked; and he never recommends dental work that's not necessary. He's also sensitive to people's pain! The staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful; and they're especially great when you have an emergency. The building is welcoming too: a warm setting, not at all clinical looking.
Dunn and Platts has our total endorsement. You can trust them completely.< /text>

< Review>
Greetings - One of the hardest things to do is find an outstanding and competent health care services in a small and friendly community.  Twelve and half year ago we (my wife and I) moved to the San Jacinto Valley.  We have belonged to one of the world's largest health maintenance organizations for are health needs.  However, we were unable to find a dental care professional in the local area and continued to travel back to our prior home some 50 + miles away to seek dental care and services.  Then about three years ago a neighbor recommended the services of Dr. Dunn, a good and caring dentist.  Being senior citizens, we were hard to please when it came to having a health professional that showed care, compassion and current knowledge in treating the older generation of society.  Thankfully we found the Offices of Dunn & Platt's in the local area of the San Jacinto Valley.  Ever since we have found Dr. Dunn and Dr. Platt and their staff of highly competent and caring dental professionals we found a new home for our dental needs.  We will continue to use their services for continuing dental health needs.  We wish to thank Dr. Dunn and his staff for treating us with such care and professional understand as we continue down our path of life.  The Dental Office of Dunn & Platts come with our highest recommendation and hope you too will their dental services to your liking.< /Review>

<Review>A friend of ours invited us for a little play date here and it was amazing. This park is located in a safe neighborhood and offered beautiful scenery. The splash pad is tiny but so much fun for the kids!! I just wish there were swings here.

💰This park is free
🚙Small parking lot but additional free street parking in the surrounding neighborhood
🎠1 playground with some pretty tall slides and a mulch ground surface but no swings.
🖼Small lawn with large shady trees
🧺Metal picnic tables under pergola
🚽Restrooms
🥾Paved trail surrounding the entire lake (1 lap is 3/4 of a mile)
⛲️Splash pad fountain (only runs for 15 minute intervals. Check the photo above for times)
🎣Lake fishing allowed with valid license
🦆Bring some food to feed the ducks off the dock
🏘Tucked into a quiet beautiful neighborhood
🛣Lake is far from busy roads< /Review>< pictures>

One of our favorite parks. My kids love the fountain, the lake, the trail... What's not to love. Occasionally, you might even find a familiar character rushing around. Today, it was Mando. A few weeks ago it was Black Widow.<//Review>

<Review>Very nice neighborhood and location. Solid play structure and a cool fountain that goes off starting at 11am, almost hourly (see screen shot for actual schedule)
The fountain fills a small area where kids can get their feet wet and splash around a bit, which is perfect on a nice hot day. Only thing lacking here was a good swing set.</Review>< rating>

What a beautiful place.
Interesting how it's entrance is in a pretty  neighborhood, however soon enough you will find yourself in nature and surrounded by neat trails to choose from. This is also a way to get to Double peaks park for the gorgeous panoramic view.< /Review>

Nice little lake stroll and can be more challenging if you take the up trail. We stuck to the small easy trail but found it to be hot and also very inviting and beautiful. Great for a quick stroll in the area!</review>

<review>Beautiful Park. When there's not construction it's perfect. But they're building homes right in the back of it. But it's a great little track to run around. There's also a bunch of Trail systems attached to it and you can even get to the top of double Peak from it.< /review>< Pictures>

Nice walking for the family or with pup.  Centered in a residential area so there is always parking.  It was busy when I went so but was still enjoyable.  I only did the walk around the lake but hear there are other trails to take as well.< /text>

Great flat trail around this lake as well as a few trails with decent climbs. My 2 year old loves the playground and water feature. Keep your eyes open for the snakes , they won't attack you just don't step on one.< /Review>

<review>Love this park. Small little sections. Apparently there is some mountain biking trails here I plan to explore during the week.
It was clean maintained park. People were fishing (no license required but it is a catch and release with no barbs left in the fish), walking,running and there was even a few kids breakdancing. Met a bunch of very friendly puppies. There was a small playground there. It seemed to be a big circle so it wasn't a super big park but I did walk it a few times.</review>< username>

Such a beautiful park and almost empty at lunchtime on the fourth.  We were talking advantage of the multitude of paths and trails that surround this park and stopped here for a nice rest in the shade.  I was surprised to find some privacy in this family-friendly, lovely park on a holiday with absolutely perfect weather.</review>

Great place to walk and/or jog and if you're feeling good about yourself, you can hike all the way up to Double Peak!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is a lovely local park with plenty to see and do, and as a bonus the city just recently replaced the playground equipment!  There's a bunch of different things to entertain yourself with here, including a small lake/large pond with a fishing pier, plenty of walking trails including one that goes up to the top of Double Peak mountain, and a huge water fountain for kids to play in on hot summer days!  This park is quite popular so sometimes you'll have a bit of trouble with parking, but so far it hasn't been worse than any other park in SD county that we've visited.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Nestled in the middle of suburban San Marcos lies Discovery Lake and Lakeview Park. A top notch play area, a dock to feed the fish, a walking trail around the lake and a splash fountain for the dog days of summer. On second thought, don't go there.< /Text><Name>Matthew Stallan</Name>< Response>

<Text>Guys, dont feed the ducks breads, crackers or starches. That pollutes the water. Leafy greens are the way to go. Advise others.
With that being said, great park to relax. Parking is quite limited. Lets all make an effort to keep this wonderful lake clean.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Small park with limited parking, but plenty of parking on the streets. It’s the start of the double peak hike. You can walk around the lake and feed the ducks or you can start hiking upwards to double peak. Lots of families, dogs and people just being active.< /Review>

We had a wonderful experience at this location!! From the receptionists, nurse and doctor! They got us in right away even though they had a booked schedule. I can not say enough about this caring and knowledgeable staff. Thank you Banfield Murrieta ❤️🐶Marty<//Review>

I'm new to the area. Didn't even have a vet yet.
My pup had was injured on Easter. The emergency locations weren't able to help because they were all full and my pup wasn't critical.   The team squeezed my pup in.  Assessed, cleaned his wound and they were able to take wonderful care of him. Great team. Thank you!!<//Text>

You can just tell they have an enormous compassion and love and patience for all fury friends. We knew our Sidney was in good hands. Even when she wasn't as cooperative with the vet, they did everything they could to make her comfortable and suggested what I can do at home to provide comfort. Our baby is a rescue and she is losing a lot of hair. I'm sure it's due to stress because of the new environment. The staff there was very helpful.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

I have been a Banfield wellness plan customer for 8 years, and recently moved to the area. I took my dog in for a semi-emergency for a wound cleaning and evaluation. After we arrived and checked in for our drop off appointment, we waited over 10 minutes before anyone came out to take my dog to the back, watching others who checked in after us get taken back, before the person who checked us in finally just took my dog back. This happened again when I went to pick up my dog - I paid and then waited, and waited, before the person who checked me out went and got my dog. I understand that they are busy, but this seemed to be an indicator that they easily miss things and set the visit off on the wrong foot.
In addition, the doctor who called was not very responsive to the symptoms and description of the issue and seemed to push an agenda in terms of what they thought was wrong. They charged me for a wound cleaning, bandage, and sent us home with antibiotics and said to come back in 10 days. No one called to follow up on us, which is normal practice for Banfield hospitals that we've visited in the past.
All of this added up to an uneasy feeling for me, so I ended up getting a second opinion at another local vet, who diagnosed my dog with a semi-rare infection that requires a lot more care than we ever would've gotten from Banfield.
As a result of this experience, I have cancelled my wellness plan and moved my dog's care to the other vet - and I won't recommend the Banfield plans to anyone anymore. The level of care that my dog has received at the other  vet in just the past two weeks has FAR exceeded any care I received from any Banfield hospital in the past 8 years.</Text>

Basically paid over $1,000 for them to not even identify what was wrong with my cat and she ended up passing away. Then they failed to call me when her remains became available for pick up. Highly disappointed from start to end.< /Text>

<text>Showed up for my scheduled appointment. Waiting around for an employee for 10 minutes then PetSmart employee tells me that Banfield is unexpectedly closed? Nobody ever contacted me.

Murrieta location.This last appt was scheduled for July 3rd and when we showed up no one was at the front desk and the lights in the rooms were off so I waited about 5 minutes before I ask the check out lady from petsmart  to find out they were closed for the week. No one called us to reschedule. I was not happy and now my dogs immunizations are past due and I can't board him or go on vacation until I can get a new appt<//Review>< rating>

<Text>I found a coupon for a free visit online, called to make an appointment and was rudely told they could not honor it since there was no expiration date. I asked to speak to the office manager and was put on eternal hold. What a horrible way to handle perspective clients. I will never take my pets here and will tell friends and family to steer clear.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pictures>

<Text>I needed a closer veterinarian for my dogs since I moved. Husband and I visited Banfield today, medicine in hand and he approached the woman in the front, she immediately saw it was a prescription medication in his hand and told him to go back to his vet. I would not recommend this place as they obviously could care less about your business.</Text><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc8215e14b47cf:0xbd381706268695da< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Such a nice quiet place to get tea, coffee, smoothies....my daughter and I drive past 3 coffee places to have our time together. The ladies are always helpful (I am terrible at deciding what I want!) and happy. They have quite the selection of beverages as well as some adorable gifts!< /Review>

<Text>I'm in love with this shop.  They make their own coconut milk, chai, and honey lavender to name a few items.  But the moment one walks in, it's evident that the owner  has really put a lot of thought and passion into this establishment and it shows.

Love everything about this place from their in house recipes to the decor and the atmosphere.  Highly recommended.<//Text><user_name>Pamela Johnson<//user_name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlM2eJfWQdk4TOPVWMJyDN0Yp1fOV2P_CNYI9U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_D5HLUZVSD3K5LTXnQhGvGv7tMBiGo5V4ZZkI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFNDKU7NE9sBqxCnEPMs-oUrq53H0dgnR_KsqX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVduvc3ueQ3p2mJHn4UZhBx6HxUmLsq4mlnVLY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx-beDwzPq5EWFiLnFE4hXqgEdIb6B5UdnBj9X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs5LpEiHk-EaaJVXsHXI2BvBx-E35Q3ryOZTLR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_FoaEHzrlU_11_9Tv2RkhLFbsx25WaGw6xz2i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><UserId.>112402515099510283688</UserId.>< Response>

<Text>This is my go to spot for the best cup of coffee. The one cup at a time brew process makes the coffee shine. I was hooked on the Midway brew but then I discovered the Metro. Staff is great, super friendly, they learn your drink preference and your name!. This is a neighborhood coffee shop.</Text>< rate>

Great cute littoe coffee shop with plenty of options.  Love the matcha, but if you want coffee I always go for the honey lavender latte- a personal favorite! They carry good wholesome food too for if you need something on the go. Not cheap, but not anymore expensive than a Starbucks (And it feels better to support a local business than a monster chain).

Plus, if you drink it there you get to have it from their cute latte cups!</review>

<Review>Great atmosphere, amazingly friendly and welcoming staff, fair coffee.
There just seems to be a lack of knowledge surrounding the traditional espresso coffee wares(which I realize is slightly a matter of opinion). I was given a dry cappuccino when asking for a macchiato and had to clarify a few times what was even meant by macchiato.
The black coffee was not as light a roast as I would like but that is purely a matter of taste so no fault there. It wasn't bitter or under extracted so I can't fault the personal decision to select this coffee, nor would I want to. The massive diversity in roasting is what makes discovering new shops so exciting.
The blueberry muffin was very good. Not overly sweet, medium density, subtle blueberry flavor which actually paired quite well with the black coffee.
Was able to try the nitro coffee on my way out which was very good for those who like the texture this process brings but want a more nuanced coffee experience.
Overall I'll be returning to this shop mainly because a.they are in a dry area for decent shops and b. The staff is worth the return trip making any other shortcomings easy to overlook.< /Review>< Rate>

Great Cafe, highly recommend the iced matchas, especially the blueberry.

They offer non dairy milk options 😊<//text>
</record></dataset><record>
<Text>I can see why this coffee shop gets raving reviews. Service is wonderful, and the selection is unique and wide. I went for a cappuccino, my usual menu item at any new to me coffee shop. They use different "milk" types, including almond.

If you order your drink to stay, you get it in a beautiful cup that many people posted pictures of. It is so vibrant and colorful! The drink was very good, and the atmosphere quiet and relaxed. On a Saturday afternoon there were few people there, but I can see how during business hours the coffee shop can get quickly filled up. Seating is plentiful, and decor is somewhat rustic with elements of industrial feel. I generally prefer cozier atmosphere, but to each their own.

I will absolutely come back to try their specialties, now that I established that their cappuccino is worth drinking :)<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<rating>4</rating><Text>I wrote a review about a year ago and gave this place 5 stars. I took a star away because lately everytime I go, the coffee seems watered down and lacking the same flavor that it used to have. This problem really only happens when the newer employees make the coffee. When the owners are in the store the quality does get better. Today was probably the worst coffee I have gotten from here (still a lot better than Starbucks or homemade though). The coffee tasted like water with essence of coffee even though I got 3 shots of espresso. Hopefully the quality increases as the employees get a bit more experience.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The Liquid Leaf is one of my favorite coffee shops! I have frequented this spot any time I am in the area since it first opened, and it has only gotten better and better!

Their scones and tea are very authentic, this is one of the only shops around that I can find real, quality loose leaf tea at. We buy it and bring it home each week, it's every bit as great home brewed as in store.

The owner Ms. Jane is a sweetheart and has always made me feel like a valued guest in her business. All of the baristas are very friendly and helpful, and the seasoned employees are experts!

Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys quality coffee and tea!<//Text>

Absolutely love this place. If you like or love Starbucks... I promise this place is 10 times better and better customer service, and atmosphere. Very genuine people, they take time to know your order and have a conversation with you. The owner is is an absolute blessing, sweetest lady ever!!! Starbucks who? No seriously. Check them out.... Oh and try their raspberry or blueberry matcha.... The best thing ever!!< /review>

Ordered a Honey Lavender Latte and a semi custom blended dirty Chai, my wife loved her Latte and I can say the same about my drink as well. All of the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Will be back anytime we are in the area. The atmosphere is also very chill.< /Review>

My wife and I were looking for a local coffee shop for early morning weekend dates and we decided to give this place a try.  This place has great service, relaxed atmosphere,  and excellent menu for coffees, teas, and more.  I heard that they occasionally have live music at times.  Great place to go.< /text>

The line was quite long, but I'm glad we waited. The hot chocolate was one of the best I've tried. It was rich, chocolate decadence without being too sweet. My husband ordered the pricey siphon bar coffee, which was delicate and delicious. The siphon bar brewing, complete with flames, made for quite a show as they made his pot to order.< /text>

Cozy coffee shop with great tea and coffee selection. Their signature sauce is tasty and nutty, a good addition to any drink. Friendly staff that was very accommodating. Plenty of seating and wall outlets make for a good study spot< /Text>

Yumcha is supposed to be crowded and noisy! This place is packed and unfortunately hard to contact on the phone in the morning. It’s full of families and friends both Asian and others which shows the appeal of yumcha in Australia these days. The lack of English of some waiters just lends to the authenticity of the restaurant! We come here when we crave yumcha.<//Review>

Love this tea house! It has a very friendly, inviting atmosphere, the teas are wonderful (the chocolate chai latte is one of my favorites!), and the people are so nice!

This is my favorite place to get a hot drink in the cold, and when it gets warm I'll be coming for the iced lattes and blended smoothies!

I love that they are health concious, their drinks aren't overly sugary so you can make it sweeter if you like. They also have alternative milks (soy, almond, I think they had others but I don't remember which ones they are)...

Also, their tea cups are so adorable!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Best place to get your coffee, tea, kombucha or bowl fix. Visited today for the best thai tea with boba, a matcha bowl in a good sized container and kombucha. Excellent customer service! Thanks Liquid Leaf, we are fortunate to have this small business in the Valley.< /review>< pictures>

This is a great local tea and coffee shop feel in an otherwise fast food chain infested area. I personally love the blueberry matcha and the baked goods!<//Text>

I don't get to come here as often as I'd like because of where I live, but it is such a treat when I do. Today I tired the blended banana Chai with an add shot. Made with homemade spiced chai! It is sooo good! The drinks and food are just as wonderful as the staff. Jane, the founder, owner, manager, designer, has done such an amazing job of creating an inviting and beautiful environment. In fact, I found out that she fabricated much of the decor herself. I highly recommend visiting this clean and spacious coffee shop and trying the taste of truly hand crafted tea, coffee and smoothies! Next, I'd like to explore the breakfast sandwiches and wraps... Yuummmmm!</text>

Was driving by Ventura Blvd looking for a place to chill and eat when this place caught my eye, I turned back went in and this place is set up beautifully with all the wine fridges. The pizza is crispy, soft, and non greasy. Haven't been in the valley for awhile but coming to this place is telling me to come back home 😆< /Text>

<Review>One of the best pizzas I’ve had in a while. Great amount of sauce with the perfect crust. I warmed it up in the oven today to eat some leftovers and OMG Tasted even better today. I’ll definitely be ordering pizzas here again. I got the spaghetti meatballs & pappardelle bolognese from the 2 bolognese was our favorite. Meatballs were a little too Dry and needed flavor the spaghetti sauce needed a lil more Kick to it.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIESY4UkLRK1Kts2WfYmOLi4FALJXkDBt_H8X1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCGnIXDVAf7qYMwHOjpAF94HoxIK3F_j6kZZXY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29759867adfb1:0x899d31670f307d53</Gmap_id></record>

Honestly i came to this restaurant because I read the good reviews and saw the positive stars people
Gave them. I am so dissatisfied and disappointed by this place  . We came 02/22/21 to order 2 chicken piccata plates and a house salad. Spent 67.00 dollars on those three items. Got home to under cooked chicken breast, no pasta who eats chicken piccata without pasta ????  The salad was bland just goat cheese and pecans and two pieces of bread 🥖. So disappointed I didn’t even call and complain because is not worth the time or fuss. Just completely over priced for low quality and incomplete food.<//text>

This place really deserves an 8 star rating. Service was out of this world. The food was amazing. We ordered a thin crust pizza, the crust was thinner than a saltine cracker but oh my gosh. It packed so much flavor without it being all bread. The thin crust was not overly crunchy, just simply perfect. The alcoholic cocktails are made with 3 OZ. of alcohol instead of the average 1 OZ!!! Spectacular prices, extremely clean, cozy, and a great lunch menu. It is divided into 2 sections. Half as a restaurant with quiet dining and the other half sells alcohol; multi-functioning as a liquor store and provides the take-out orders. I believe they sell all the bottles they serve in house. EVERYTHING IN THIS RESTAURANT IS HOMEMADE. We came here with no expectations but they really blew any possible judgements away. Will continue to recommend and come back. Perfect view and location right on Ventura blvd in Sherman oaks, close to studio City.<//Text>

If I believed in Heaven, the old man behind the counter would be there serving me cured meats and wonderfully aged cheeses for all eternity.<//Text>

If you're looking for great, fresh seafood in a cozy and relaxed atmosphere this place is it. The cioppino here is pretty amazing. It's nice enough to go to on a date and chill enough to put your fork aside for a minute and use your hands if you need to.</review>

<Review>Incredible experience coming here for dinner!!! Had well portioned dishes, fresh oysters, endless bread, a good wine selection and wonderful staff. Came in with a friend and sat at the bar, split a bottle and the crab cioppino, chowder, oysters....<//Review>< pictures>

<review>As authentic as it gets. A balanced pizza where the ingredients speak for themselves. The cheese, the tomato sauce, the olive oil, and the fairly thin, crunchy yet tender crust are evenly discerned. A go-to for a seasoned traveller longing for a local Italian trattoria off the beaten path.< /review>< pictures>

I've been twice for a weekend lunch so far, and each time has been great. The first time I ordered the ravioli zucca and I'm currently having the linguini vongole. The food comes out fast, although it hasn't been busy each time I went.

Entrées run about $20 a plate. I can't recommend this place enough. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had.</text>

Very warm and familial service with real Italian chefs. The lady behind the counter on Friday and Saturday is a wonderful historian and mixologist, changing out the specialty cocktails every week-I mean they have chartreuse!

Negroni and Aperol spritz were very well balanced with her homemade, organic bitters.

I had the pappardelle pasta which was very good and the magherita pizza was hearty. I might recommend less cheese and more basil. Tiramisu was exceptional, so well balanced with the coffee fallacies and fluffy vanilla exterior<//Text>

Service was impeccable. Clean and comfortable interior. Perfect ambience for dinner with friends or family. We had the pappardelle bolognese and spinach ricotta ravioli. Both excellent.
The waiter mentioned they are expanding and will be making pasta from scratch onsite in the near future, so it sounds like it will only get better.</text>

< review>
My son had lost his wallet in Simi Valley, and didn’t realize it until he arrived home in Lancaster. He called the manager of the apartment complex where he thought  he may have dropped it, but no one had turned it in. He figured it was gone for good, when minutes later he received a call from a gentleman who said that he had found it, with everything intact, which included credit cards and a large sum of money. It turned out that this wonderful man is the owner of Big Z! He adamantly refused any sort of reward, so my son ordered two large vegetarian pizzas, hummus, and some baklava to bring home. All I can say is that this was some of the best Mediterranean food I’ve  had in a long time. Everything was fresh, with plenty of toppings on the pizza, and the hummus and baklava were subtly  unique in  a very delightful way. Not only does the owner have incredible integrity, he also runs an establishment that puts out some of the best food of its kind. Thank you, Omar, for setting a wonderful example.< /review>

<Text>Best pizza... sauce is so wonderfully flavorful and natural...not all the extra spices,  flavors,  gimmicks. Cheese is real,  toppings are fresh.  Bonus is their special... large cheese pizza $7.50. Can't beat it,  best place to grab a pizza from.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

It is my favorite restaurant, the food is tasty and high quality. The prices is so reasonable regardless if it is catering or dining in. I love his special pizza and shawarma.</Review>

<Text>Really cool place. I love Big Z Family Restaurant.  .,..and what 2000 other people said.  If you like deep dish pizza you can't go wrong here.  I went on a Thursday night and I didn't have to wait that long for a table even though the place was packed. Definitely will head back when I'm in CA.</Text><username>Julie Young< /username><Rating>4</Rating><Date>1605061920151<//Date>< resp>

<Text>Food is good and prices are fair. Feels outdated but it's not a chain so I don't expect much. What makes this place good is the kid side. There are enough games to keep little kids entertained. The restaurant is small so you can keep an eye on them from almost anywhere. This is a decent option for parents who are looking for a quick bite to eat.< /Text></record>

The food at Big Z is good. Have never eaten in - only ordered delivery or picked up/to-go. My husband loves the pizza (double pepperoni) and the chicken tenders with fries. I personally like the other entrees on the menu (chicken piccata, chicken teriyaki, chicken curry, spaghetti with meat sauce). Giving 4 stars since the games are dated, but my 3-year-old enjoys skeeball while we wait for the food.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1542038797210, 'text': "I'm truly sorry to see you couldn't enjoy your pizza this time around, and that you didn't feel well taken care of by our team in general. We work hard to prepare a delicious pizza and serve all of our guests, but it sounds like we were pretty backed up and short-staffed this time. We know how frustrating that is for our guests, but know that we always do our best. As for your pizza, once it leaves our kitchen, it's out of our hands, and there's not much we can do for you after that. We'd never intentionally give a guest a cold pizza, but we'll do better to give our customers an accurate time for when they can come pick it up. Additionally, you can be assured that we take health codes and guidelines very seriously. We hope you'd consider giving us another try sometime -- our doors are always open to you. -Gerry M., Manager"}</response><Review>I just ordered from Big Z's and this is maybe the third time I've ordered from them and I am totally disgusted! The first time I ordered the pizza was perfect. This is what brought me in there for the second time, I ordered the same thing which was pepperoni with extra cheese! Only the second time it was more like a pepperoni with NO cheese. I decided why not try it one more time...Upon pickup I was standing there for a while waiting for cashier to finish up with other customers. When it was my turn he handed me the pizza and asked if I wanted anything with it. So I said ranch and parmesan. He then help someone else then came back to me with ranch then helped another person then came back to me with parmesan. I rush home and discover a cold pizza, not warm, cold! I called the store back immediately to let them know it's not hot. The guy on the phone told me that it's because I took so long to pick it up. . .You never gave me a time frame when I ordered it and I had assumed that even if it did take me 10 minutes to walk over there I would still receive a warm Pizza like maybe it would keep it on the oven to keep it halfway lukewarm!!! Nope... I guess they are okay with serving food at temperatures that could cause food poisoning but hey not every restaurant keeps up with health and safety codes! This guy was so rude on the phone he just kept repeating I took so long to pick it up. I said you sounded busy when I ordered but you actually did not give me pick up time. He argued some more that it was because it took me so long to pick it up. I asked him can I bring it back can you remake it like this is me trying a new place to enjoy pizza is there anything other to be said then blaming the whole thing on me!?!?! He sat in silence. I told him it's ok I will just throw it away and go somewhere else. ... No response from him, we hung up and there is my pizza sitting in the trash! So when Google asks what do you think of big Z's... .🤔 I think that Little Caesars, Round Table, and Vincenzo's all taste better, serve food at normal temprature, and at the very least....trea t people like they are people! What a waist of both of our time, my money, his dedication to it all being my fault, a new customer, and a waist of pizza!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>the first time we ordered deserts from here through ubereats we ordered a
crème brûlée and a flan and they did the carmelized sugar on the flan instead of the  crème brûlée, tonight we ordered 2 crème brûlée’s and they gave us 2 flans which was super disapointing because we arent a fan of the flan at all... i think they need to start labeling their food better. the baklava is 10/10 tho</Text>< Pics>

The pizza is good. Price was soso with coupon. Game selection is limited. The owner is very grumpy. The environment is not family friendly.</review>

< review>
We’ve been to the Glendale location and they had given us so much for less.

My wife and I are from FL, and we love yoshinoya because of the Glendale location.

Today we stopped here in Burbank and they skimped out on portions horribly. My wife is a YouTuber and we watched our video from the last time we visited and it’s a night and day difference.

My wife ordered a large no veggie and double rice. I went back and showed them there isn’t much rice and 7 pieces of shrimp. He acted like he didn’t know what I was saying and I said how much for extra rice and without saying anything he just rung me up.

Then next customers, we’re charged .75 for teriyaki even though they already paid for it but acted like they did.

I don’t like leaving 1 star reviews but if you can just go to another location.<//review>

Its just not what it used to be! Portions got smaller and it just does not taste how it used to. The server was nice and the food was ready fast so my rating has nothing to do with the employees at this location</text>

< Review>
Service was nice and pick up was easy. We ordered combos, rice, veggies, orange chicken  shrimp, and another one with teriyaki chicken.
The rice and vegetables had no flavor, and the shrimp and orange chicken I got tasted like it was microwaved and then they just poured orange sauce over it (instead of it actually being cooked/tossed in the sauce!). Honestly, this reminded me of school lunch teriyaki and orange chicken. The boneless wings also only got some random sauce dumped on it. I immediately did not like the taste or smell of it. We almost spent $30 on that but had a coupon to cut it down to $15. We wanted to try a new place and now we will definitely be sticking to Panda Express, 100x better.< /Review>

Agh, I hate giving 1⭐, but I'm writing this review so the manager can keep an eye on the female cashier to not wear airpod while she's working. That's not nice at all and I won't feel good as a new customer if she takes my order again...<//review>

Simple, easy, and effective. I forgot my cup at the counter. The cashier was nice enough to bring it to me. THAT'S service which makes a regular restaurant an excellent experience. It may not seem like much, but the hospitality doesn't go overlooked. I highly recommend.<//Text>

<review>I've been in this location about 4 times in the last 12 months but last Wednesday I ordered a combo of beef and chicken.  The beef is hard and smelly.  I had to spit it out.  Even when I used a lot of red pepper the beef seems old, thick and poor quality.  I have been to different Yoshinoyasp once or twice a month.  This is the first time it tasted horrible.  No plans of going back to this location anytime soon.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The food is very well made and basically nil a thing I say about this place is that the sauces could be either too sweet or not enough flavor depending on what you order.<//text>

I ordered the tray which is a great combo deal, one main, two sides, and a milkshake add on for $1 (normally $3). I got a dressed burger, onion rings andThe meal was filling and satisfying, and I liked having the option of sitting inside or on the spacious outside patio.<//review>

Regular customer of this particular Yoshinoya Burbank. I like the food, but have TWO issues. The putrid sewage smell that you refuse to fix is one - I don't know if that's messing with my food in any way. The second one is your FALSE ADVERTISING, which is a misdemeanor under US Penal Code 15, Section 54, and can carry hefty penalties if a community decides to involve an attorney for a class-action lawsuit (hint hint). You are stealing from your customers by charging them a price for which you promise an advertised product that you are not delivering. I ask for my bowl to match the picture on your menu EVERY TIME, and every time I am refused, with the excuse of "that's how corporate tells us to serve it".  Pictured on the left is your advertisement, and on the right, my latest bowl, half empty, practically, You can see all the rice, and instead of the 22 pieces of chicken your menu shows and a FULL bowl of rice, the rice barely filled half of my bowl and I had only 13 pieces of chicken. So, let's hear what you have to say, Yoshinoya. What's your excuse for stealing from me?< /Text>

The manager Lucio is a disrespectful person. He has no idea how to treat customers nor how do to deal with complaints. I called in to ask about the change that was not given to me by the cashier and as i was still speaking on the Phone he hung up
Sir if you dont want to be there or be a supervisor why show up to work and why be a supervisor ? You should rethink twice whether this is a right job for you.< /Text>

<name>Jadyn_Escobar_Maus</name><text>This is actually not a 5 star; it’s just to get my comment noticed. I always order a beef bowl with a side order of veggies. And I always ask for my onions cooked , because they always make them raw. And some stupid cook whispered to the cashier in Spanish that it would take 30 minutes. Well I’m not stupid and to grill a couple of onions takes a few minutes not a half hour.< /text>< Pictures>

Been a while since we've been to a Yoshinoya, the beef bowl is still the go to meal here. Looks like they're offering new items in the menu now. Parking is alright, service is great and seating is ample.<//Review>

<Text>It’s ok taste and price. A cashier isn’t friendly. They can’t beat original Japanese Yoshinoya. Brown rice was bad shape. It’s over cooked and almost paste.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c29541a427843b:0xd083b5eb609f4e3a</GmapID><user_id>106467458673968720673</user_id><username>Tomomi Gallagher< /username>< time>

<review>The food is good, the problem is that some days the cooks are the youngest, they do not prepare the food well. The other cooks are good.  Everything else very well. Unos cocineros jóvenes no preparan bien la comida, solo los cocineros más viejos.< /review>< pictures>

We went to grab a quick dinner at Yoshinoya. This was my second time visiting this fast food chain. Unlike other fast foods, Yoshinoya is very healthy and they have hearty meals available. We ordered Large Orange Chicken Bowl, Large Walnut Shrimp Bowl and 6pcs Asian BBQ Wings. I had orange chicken at Panda Express before and I much more prefer their flavor. However, Walnut Shrimp Bowl was very yummy. We ate in one gulp :) Total was around $20 Not bad for that much amount of food. I don't usually like veggies at Fast Food restaurant but Yoshinoya's veggies were crisp and fresh! I recommend getting Walnut Shrimp Bowl for sure!!</Text>

The service was terrible...the orange chucken was as HARD AS A ROCK! Literally. And they give small portions as well. The only good thing was the water. The rib eye beef was old and hard. We will never eat at yoshinoya again.< /text>

Saved our bacon (again). Two days before Thanksgiving and suddenly we notice a pool of water leaking out from under our fridge. We ran into a similar situation with our dishwasher a while back, and Shata handled that quickly and efficiently. This time: Every bit as good, promptly and with good humor. What a relief. Gratitude: achieved. An entirely positive experience. Highly recommended.</Text>

I own a physical therapy clinic. Our dryer broke, which is a huge problem for us as we use our dryer continuously throughout the day. Shata was able to come the same day and make recommendations on what to do. Very helpful and also their price is very reasonable as compared to others. I would highly recommend Shata Appliance repair.<//text>

My refrigerator freezer section not working and I'm worried about it. I called Sub Zero Appliance Repair immediately for help. They arrived quickly and help me fix the issue. I am very happy having them today and working with these guys. Thank you very much and I would strongly recommend them to anyone that need appliance repair.</Review>

Nightmare scene at 2:30am - the water pipe to my refrigerator broke.  Water was pouring out from underneath my fridge - my entire kitchen floor was filling with water.  So glad I was still awake and caught this before it became a serious flood. I was frantic and searched Google and Yelp for a 24-hour repair service and found Shata.  Andrei answered my text.  He wasn't able to come immediately but he walked me through a temporary solution.  He came a few hours later and fixed the issue.  Amazing!  You can't find service like this anywhere.<//review>

Andrei, the owner, came the next morning after I called about my broken Miele dishwasher.  He was on-time and called 20 minutes ahead.  It took him only 30 minutes to fixed my dishwasher and he charged me a very fair price.  I also got some good appliance maintenance advice from him and he checked out my refrigerator for free (and found nothing wrong).  All in all I couldn't have had a better experience.< /review>

<Text>I called Andrei when my mind was set on getting rid of my ancient Viking fridge. Right before that I had spent a fortune and months looking for the parts that turned out to be not needed. Andrei was able to adjust readily available parts for the fraction of the cost. The thing has been working ever since and the temperature controls are not a guess work anymore! I called Andrei with a few questions after the job was done and he has always been helpful and spared no time and patience to make sure that I understand what needs to be done. Andrei kicks ass.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1572668822828, 'text': 'Thank you'}</resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Sunday afternoon and my refrigerator stops working! I called Andrei at Shata Appliance. He came out and took a look at it, told me how much it would be and how long to get the new circuit board it needed. He got my parts quicker than he thought and had us up and running fast. Andrei is very professional and works very clean. Shata Appliance is my first call for my appliance repairs, and should be yours.<//Review>

Search place has a very nice outdoor patio right in front of the main entryway.  The food, service and outdoor ambiance all contribute to a very nice experience. And it doesn't hurt that the prices are reasonable. All in all this is an excellent value and a great experience for dining during the covert 19 restrictions.<//Text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>Horrible food. At first the fact that they did not have potatoes (as a steak side) should have warned us. We ordered a medium/rare ribeye that came out well-done. The pasta and the sauce looked liked it was from a costco can. Do not believe the 4.4 star rating.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>Once upon a time, Terra Mia was my favorite Italian restaurant in Livermore. Oh, what changed??
I have been disappointed the last three times that I have eaten there.
I ordered veal piccata but chicken piccata arrived at my table. My waiter, David, was wonderful. He insisted on sending it back. Then came something that was much like a tasteless piece of leather and very tough. It was served next to polenta which was cold, absolutely tasteless, and with a muddy consistency. The broccoli and veggies were mush. I was thankful to have bread with olive oil and balsamic because that was my dinner.<//Text>< Pics>

Excellent food and service.  The restaurant is decorated very well.  There is an outdoor patio for outdoor seating as well as indoor seating.  There is also a private room for larger events.  They start off with a bread basket.  There is balsamic vinegar and olive oil on the table to self-serve.  The balsamic vinegar is very tasty.  Their calamari was woofed down by everyone in 2 seconds flat. The lasagna is really done well.. not too acidic.  The fettuccine with Bolognese was excellent.  The portion of the tortellini with ham and tomato cream sauce was too small.  The pizza was yummy.  However,  I have had better elsewhere. Our water was constantly filled.   Our used dishes were  seldom left long at the table.  The servers exchanged our dirty dishes for new dishes numerous times.  We would definitely come back again for the delicious food and service.</review>

Delicious! Recommend the gnocchi gorgonzola ... I had no idea gnocchi could be so soft! You can taste the potato in them too, and the gorgonzola sauce is just amazing. The garlic bread is delicious too, and they have a very nice ginger beer for non-alcoholic lovers. Will need to come back to try something new!!

Tried the tortellini ala crema - delicious!! It's not often I find somewhere that does meat-filled pasta, and this does not disappoint. The sauce is wonderfully flavorful too! Also recommend the prosciutto and melon - very tasty and refreshing! Excellent as an appetizer, would definitely get again.</review>

< review>
This is a review for two experiences. One visit was dining in and the security and was for take-out.

Dining in we went to the restaurant in a group of 5. Our server was excellent and answered many menu related questions from our group. The food was delicious, fresh, and just the right serving size. We shared two different salads and each ordered a pasta entree. Everyone was pleased with the food. They also had a good tap list to choose from with some unique offerings.

The take-out experience was during the county's shelter in place. The pizza we had was perfect to share for 2-3 people. I tried the veggie pizza and look forward to trying some of their other toppings soon.< /review>

Even in chinavirus times,  terra mia has the best Italian food in Livermore.
Great wine selection,  awesome menu, even better staff, especially the poor overwhelmed bus boy/table assistant...thanks dude, for the hard work.
I love everything about TM but for now,  i will stand with the Gnocchi Gorgonzola and the Pollo Saltimboca as their best offerings.  Never fails to satisfy every taste bud.</Text>

< Review>
Lasagana and margherita pizza. Both were very good. Crust on the pizza especially good, but a little over-done in some spots. Lasagana was good, but the pasta to cheese ratio was a little short. It tasted tomatie to my girlfriend. I liked the meatiness of it, though it could be gussied up a bit. I think it's traditional with good ingredients and fresh parm to top you're entre. Calamari app was excellent.< /Review>

Great food but noise level is just too high there. Acoustics are terrible. Fellow diners were not exceptionally loud but the terrible acoustics made it seem as if they were. Food however was very tasty, large portions, very good service. Even without a reservation we were seated immediately. If noise isn't an issue then I highly recommend.< /Text>

Nice Italian restaurant in a small plaza in Livermore. Close to wine country, this restaurant has good food, a nice atmosphere and decent service. On my most recent visit, a busy Saturday night, the service was a little slow, but it just allowed is to enjoy our drinks more.< /review>

<Text>First time going to this restaurant, I ordered Take out and lots of it and tipped 20%.  They didn’t put my Teramasu desert in the bag.  I called and asked why they didn’t.  The guy on the phone stated he forgot and that it’s not on my receipt.  I tipped him 3 times the price of the Teramasu and maybe I should have asked to get my tip back as he is rude and horrible customer service.  The food is so so.</Text>< date>

We had a group of around 25 in a very nice private buffet room for up to 50 people.  The room was quiet with the doors closed and was right next to the bar. Some folks arrived late, after we had moved on to other courses but the staff brought out more of the food for them. The servers Paco and Giaccomo, and the busser Maggie, were all fantastic. Jiovanie the bartender makes a  great Manhattan and I understand does good with the other drinks also. The food was absolutely fantastic. The person who organized it for us this year also mentioned that they were much easier to arrange it with than places we have had previous events. This is where we will go again next year.<//text>

Excellent food and service! My husband had the steak, I had the gnocchi gorgonzola which was melt in your mouth delicious.  We shared the wonderful mascarpone mousse, which was light and fluffy.
Great service by Dave, thank you for the great recommendations! We have found our new favorite Italian restaurant!< /Review>

This hidden gem used to be the diamond in the rough. But after recent changes, it no longer shines bright. The food is still good, but the smaller menu, MUCH smaller portions and escalating prices, I find it harder to enjoy what was once our favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. Perhaps we will still make it over there occasionally, but this place has fallen from where it once stood: at the top< /Review>

You can always expect to get an amazing meal at Terra Mia. The food selection is very nice and the service is usually very good. On one or two occasions, the food took extremely long to arrive, but it is a rare case for that to happen. I don't drink wine, but I see lots of people bringing their favorite bottle with them. I'm not sure if that means their wine selection is not so good or highly marked up, but it is nice that they offer the flexibility.< /review>

<text>My sister lives in Livermore, and I travel from Gilroy to go to Terre Mia's with her. It's an annual event for us and we always order the same thing: a glass of Prosecco, Carbonara, and we share a Spumoni for dessert. The Carbonara is wonderful and very authentic--not saucy at all. It's on the "dry" side but so flavorful with pancetta.  Delicious!  The Spumoni finishes the meal off nicely.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This is a really excellent Italian restaurant that I ate at last night. We started with bruschetta and the tomatoes were fresh and served on crisp garlic bread. Followed with the chicken saltimbocca which was delicious. No room for dessert but lots of good selections available. We ate early (5pm on a Sunday) and the place was already filling up so reservations are strongly recommended. Service was friendly and quick. Strongly recommend this place!<//Review>

They have really good food, a large menu with a lot of options to choose from. The food is delicious but the service needs a lot of work. We waited for 20 minutes for our meal which is fine but it came out cold. They were apologetic and replaced it for us.<//Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Beautiful place.  Food was good but did not stand out for me,  nothing to complain about,  just regular Italian  fare.  Maybe I just didn't order the right dish,  or maybe I just have been to so many excellent Italian restaurants in the city and also in Italy that it's hard to be impressed. The service was excellent. I will not hesitate to come back..... Maybe next time I could try something else and edit my review.<//Review>< Date>

Ordered an expensive veal dish to go as we were too exhausted to eat there.  The meal was ready on time and the meat and veggies were perfect.  The potatoes were wet, mushy and really tasted like reheats from the day before.  They actually had a refrigerator taste. I called and brought them back on principle given the cost of the meal.  The owner agreed they were awful and he said he would send me home with a box of properly prepared ones in 5 to 10 minutes at the longest.  45 minutes I was still waiting.  Finally my husband, who was waiting in the car, came in, and we were given a box of potatoes that were somewhat better than the first.  I could have made them from scratch in the time we waited.  The owner does not have any principles. Period.<//text>

The service was exceptional! And considering it is such a nice and authentic Italian restaurant, it is very well priced, with most entrees being in the teens. I've only gone the one time and there were 5 of us in our party and we each got different entrees and we were all very pleased.  The ambiance of this restaurant is also quite nice. It would be a great place to go on a date too as it's quite romantic feeling as well.< /text>

THEY would not split a house salad..charged for 2 small salads, more than we each wanted...and it cost more. Service (@ 5PM mind you was very slow.) Children's menu, about a cup of Penne Pasta with butter $9 DOLLARS, can you believe??? Adult meals were OK, not great, and mine was lukewarm. One child had a Birthday, we were asked what  he'd  like for dessert...then they charged for it. 2 salads, Entrees and 1 dessert....took until 640pm with a 5PM Reservation😦😥<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

If you are in Livermore, you have to go to Terra Mia Italian. The service and food are best in Bay Area ( my opinion).
I highly recommend it! I never have a bad experience at Terra Mia, 4040 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550< /review>

<Text>Service was good. Waiter very personal.  $20 corkage fee definitely unreasonable. Fairly over priced for menu and portions. Bus boy over anxious to clear plates from the table before everyone had completed their meal.  Food average in my opinion. Better deal at strizzi's downtown.< /Text>< response>

What a lovely dinner we had. The salads were not the best, but were fine. The gnocchi with gorgonzola (two in our party ordered it) was a hit, despite the fact it could have been a little sharper. The bolognese, the pizza, and the prima vera were good. What brings my rating to five stars was the impeccable service. The service perfectly walked that fine line between attentive and intrusive. The youngest in our party was being a bit petulant and was the recipient of a little extra attention and it was just right. We will be returning soon.</text>

<Review>Overall I was disappointed from the meal. The restaurant had poor acoustics and was very loud. The salad was watery and my clam pasta was bland. I spent over twenty dollars for buttered noodles and a handful of clams and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who respects Italian food.</Review>< rate>

Old school-style Italian place, nice outdoor seating but kinda dark inside, lots of room. The salmon ziti was very good as was the house salad. Good wait service, without that pestering "is everything ok" as they rush by after you've just taken one bite. Very good decaf coffee, which is kinda hard to find. Sensible pricing.<//text>

I had the lasagna and it was meaty, pasta goodness. Got some typical apps like calamari and bruschetta. Both were great.  I would definitely suggest this to anyone looking for a nice but not overly fancy Italian place with an emphasis on good food at reasonable prices.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Sadly, this place has decent reviews, but my wife and I had a horrible experience with the food. Started off with being told to sit anywhere we wanted on the patio, so we did. Two tables who were sat after us we greeted and given menus and a waiter, but 10 minutes later...we still hadn't been acknowledged so I went and told the host. 5 min after that, we were greeted. I asked the waiters recommendation on a bottle of Rose...he recommended the most expensive, but had no tasting notes to go with his rec. I asked if they had Linguini and clams. The waiter told me "no....this is not italian authentic, so we don't have that".  What a lie.  My wife ordered the fetcuini al salmon and I ordered a pesto pasta with salmon on top. We also ordered a calamari fritti to start.  Calamari came out and was soft and chewy.....no crisp at all. I sent it back telling them why. They brought it back 5 min later and they had dumped the calamari back in the oil and killed it. Now it was crispy, chewy grossness. We set it aside, not eating it. Then the pastas came....  Both were horrible. My wife pasta was under al dente, and mine was overcooked....but they were the same noodle. The Salmon was diced into small pieces and incorporated into the dish rather than a nice fillet on top. Salmon was horrible....overcooked beyond done! It tasted and smelled horrible.
After telling the waiter, the manager came over and i very very kindly explained how bad our meal was, pointing out exactly why wit the salmon and the calamari. Then our bill came. They removed my entree, but still charged me for my wife's horrible entree and the sad calamari. The only thing worth paying for was the wine. So in the end, I paid out $90.00 ($40.00 for the wine & $15.00 tip) and left hungry and annoyed. Stopped at in-n-out on the way home, which was 100 times better that Terra Mia. If you like real Italian food, stay far away from this place...NEVER AGAIN!!</text>

You can literally taste the difference! Everything else is also very fresh on the menu and I love their garden salad. It's super crisp and I love the beet on the top of the salad. The service is also very good and they are very attentive but also let you take your time. They never try to rush you when you are here and make you feel like you can stay as long as you want which is great. Definitely make this your place to go if you are in the area. They also carry a bunch local wines such as Wente and Concannon which is nice also!<//text>< gmapID>

<review>The first thing I notice upon entering was that the restaurant was very loud. The bread that they served before the main course was sad. It tasted like wonder bread. The servers were polite, but very hawkish as if they were bored and needed things to do. Food was not great for the price. Out of my group, some dishes were good and others were bland.< /review>< pics>

Making a reservation apparently does not mean anything to this restaurant, Other customers with no reservation who got there after my date and I, got seated before us. Maybe its because Im in my early 20's and Im not a priority in their eyes... who knows. Once I was seated I felt unwelcome by the waiter, every time we spoke he gave me a sarcastic sympathetic tone of voice. Worst part was when I wanted to order a beverage with alcohol , the waiter gave me such an sarcastic apologetic tone thinking that i was not of age and Instead he suggested I get a soda... Like seriously ? Once my date and I got our drinks and dinner, it was just disappointing and lacking flavor. when it was time to pay the waiter gave me a look as if I could not afford to be there. It was just such a unpleasant experience, and felt extremely unwelcome. This is the only place I have ever written a review for. I think I'll stay with my usually spot in SF where they actually treat you right, and not talk down to you.< /review>

<Text>Had dinner at Terra Mia Friday night.  Very disappointed.  Spaghetti Aglio was dry... pasta was stuck together. Three olives in my pasta.  Have patronized this place for years but quality has slowly declined. Best part of the meal... Altamont Beer.   Not likely to give them another chance.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Food was okay not great. Server was not able to pronounce the dishes and his busboy completely cleared the table before we were asked about desserts! It was not a good experience. We decided we will not go back!<//text>

When we first arrived we got absolutely no greeting for at least 5 mins, while they were busy I've never been too a place were I never been greeted. While their food was lacking in favor, their gnocchi is great. I have given this place a try 2 or 3 times after that experience, due to the fact this is the most decent Italian  food in our area. Our experiences after our first was no where near as bad, but we have learned to stick with the gnocchi and go when it's not their busiest times, like on a Monday night.</review><user_name>Mariah</user_name>< UserId.>

From early on, the co-owners were extremely helpful and accommodating, particularly Daniele. On the day of, we were swamped with wedding related activities, and the owners and wait staff made sure things ran smoothly with table arrangements, decorations, etc while we were absent. During service, wait staff were fantastically smooth and efficient, never in the way, but always available if we needed anything. The manager was able to quickly put together an alternative meal when it turned out one guest couldn't eat something (gorgonzola in the gnocchi). And the food was top-to-bottom great. We had the banquet options of caprese, garlic bread, osobucco, gnocchi, finished with tiramisu. All were delicious and and we heard only compliments from the guests (3/4 of whom were asian and wouldn't mind telling us if anything was wrong!). Wine and cocktail selection was excellent as well. All-in-all, Terra Mia, its owners, and its staff made our wedding reception as high quality as we could have asked, our guests happy, and us able to enjoy the evening with minimal stress. My only regret from the evening is that my brain was so fried with everything else that I think I forgot to tip as much as I wanted. I'll make it up though, next time I'm in the area as I'm sure we'll be coming back!</review>< Pics>

They have special areas such as quiet areas specifically catered to people who are looking for an ambient, peaceful atmosphere to be productive or relax :). Furthermore, there’s also spaces such as a “teen room” and a children’s area so that kids can be a little more “free” and it’s great because it’s less distracting! The views of the trees are especially gorgeous during rainy weather and compliments the essence of a library. I highly recommend! +very spacious and wide variety of literature.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808e35e49b405fc7:0xdf909dfc6fe7949e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful community resource. Contemporary building with well defined areas for a variety of activities. Empathetic staff keep it mellow and welcoming. Parking is easy in two lots and on the street.< /review>

We visited the Los Gatos Library for story time. They have story time for preschool aged kids every Tuesday at 1030am. At first I wasn't sure the time was correct as the library doesn't actually open until 11am but upon arrival I saw a sign on the front door that said to enter along the right side of the building, through the garden for story time. Story time lasts from 1030-11am and includes the reading of several books PLUS singing and dancing! Which must be why they do it before the library actually opens. Be sure to come check it out.<//Text>

WHAT a space! Amazing resources, fast WiFi. Parking is limited, but Los Gatos is pretty walkable.

I led a family music event this morning with the help of the children's librarians, and they were AWESOME. Can't wait to be back.<//Review>

It's just a little noisy in he children's area if u want to conduct a homework session there. And there're no foreign language books like in other nearby libraries.<//text>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>A beautiful facility that stands in the shadows of the former library that housed a quirky basement design -- miss it a bit. The new, is just that. Well designed with welcoming reading room that mimics a home-like setting with comfortable club chairs and gas fireplace, along with extensive selection of magazines, periodicals and newspapers. Available computers are terrific -- especially if one's own is unvailable. Can and do spend hours at a time investigating the various media. Has an outstanding childrens' reading room. Would welcome a larger and varied beverage station. Staff is terrific.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Alex at the front desk provided great customer service.
Everything was great except the valet a few times didn’t fetch our car in preparation to leave when we called 10-15 minutes ahead of time as instructed to do so.  They were not busy at all. We came down and total wait time was over 20 minutes.< /Review>

Loved the room complete with balcony, balcony fireplace, and my favorite—a giant soaking tub.I went for a mama birthday treat to rejuvenate, and it was close for walking to everything downtown and the rooftop bar and lounge area with fire pits were great for meeting new friends or relaxing with my book. A great downtown centered stay if you are looking to have a convenient home base to any wine tasting you are doing—or like me, feel like you are getting away even if it’s only an hour away from home. Next time, I might even consider taking my kids seeing as how the flaking courtyard to the hotel would be a safe place for them to explore and amble without my worry of cars and the street.< /text>

Visited during Covid, and they closed parts of the "common space" of the hotel to provide it for a multi-day photo shoot.  The food was fine, but seemed like they heated packaged food from Costco.  And the service was also fine... every interaction with the hotel was professional yet lacked any emotion or personalization.  Definitely not a 4 start hotel.</review>

This place has potential to be 5 star ;however, a few things really held it back. 1. The food you can order to your room is cray expensive and sub par. I was very disappointed in the cream for coffee selection. I would legit be willing to pay for organic half and half. Those little packaged-for-three million-years nasty plastic things are very 2 star motel for a place that brands itself as boutique. Also HOLY COW this room is so small. Not a place you want to do anything but sleep. The view out the window made me feel like the poor people on titanic. The "pool" is like 4"deep hahaha. Which is both great and terrible for kids. Lastly, the only fridge is a tiny wine fridge,lame. The customer service was great, everyone was friendly and accommodating.  There were some nice touches like the caramels, the coffee machine (worthless without decent cream imo) and the beauty of the lobby, but overall I would not book this room again.<//Review>

I splurged a little and got a room with a patio and fireplace. It was incredible. The nicest room my wife and I have ever stayed in. Highly recommend upgrading to the Archer suite. The staff was very friendly & helpful from start to finish. We will be back<//Text>

<Text>Really liked the hotel. Clean and lovely. Great location. Hotel restaurant was too expensive for the quality served. I asked for an iced tea and the server said he couldn’t find it LOL. I didn’t quite understand so just ordered a hot tea. This was our First time to Napa and wanted information on the local vineyards and tastings. The concierge was not very pleasant, in fact rude with some of her comments. She obviously is not familiar with schedules nor did she bother to look. Gave us a small map amd circled some locations for tastings but many of them were closed. Please have your staff especially a concierge service up to speed with schedules etc during Covid. This position should also require a “people person”, she definitely did not did not the expeditions of a 4 star hotel.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>The room was clean, but much smaller than I expected. I was disappointed that the pool was not open. I understand that covid restricted what amenities were available, but there was no indication on their website that certain amenities were still closed and their social media advertised the pool, so it seemed like it was open. Also, it should be mentioned that you either have to pay for valet or park in the parking structure, but the structure has no overnight parking so you have to wake up early to move your car. The location is great, but I don't think it was worth the price.< /text>< pics>

A fantastic place to stay on any visit to the Napa Valley.  Great environment that exudes quality from top to bottom.  The rooms are nice, but the service and attention-to-detail are a cut above -- even in an area like Napa (already known for great hospitality).
Highly Recommend!</Text>

Nice view with drinks but the service was horrible. Server came to our table once and was no where to be seen the entire night. Had to go up to the bar just to grab a second drink. Wouldn’t recommend coming here. Your better going to the hotel down the street< /Text>

We loved this hotel! Initially we booked a regular room and then updated it when we got there. We spent a lot of our time at the hotel since it was so nice. Very helpful and friendly staff. We wanted to do the hot air balloon and tried calling a company and nothing was available, then spoke to the concierge at the hotel and she arranged everything for us to do it the next morning and for a lower price than we had found. We loved our stay!</Review>

Great place to stay right in the heart of downtown Napa. Nice service, wish there was a self parking option as the valet can take a while.<//Text>

Nice rooms. Not the best views. Use valet parking because it’s a long walk if you don’t. Restaurant was closed 😡</Review>

<text>Well, check in started with a hiccup, but was handled beautifully by management. The room was absolutely stunning, spotlessly clean and very well appointed. We didn't eat on property, but it looked like the restaurant was very popular, and the rooftop bar was gorgeous with several seating areas, and gorgeous views. Perfectly located hotel.  We'd return in a heartbeat!</text>< Pictures>

2 night stay. First it is a rather new hotel that is understaffed. The hotel attracts a younger crowd attracted to the rooftop especially with the pandemic. Complimentary Nespresso coffee anD small Fiji bottled water. Our experience is rather bad due to a lack of service due to an employee dropping a bag and breaking some $500 sunglasses. They wanted to give us a $50 credit or their insurance company would review it. Based on past reviews, their claim of an insurance company, is like complaining to a North Korean hotel of them damaging something. You walk away and never go back. Also some issues with lack of COVID-19 protocols and cleanliness in the hallways and cleaning of the elevator lobbies. We have not seen this at any other hotels since the pandemic. Sad and could lead to guests getting sick. Again, perhaps stemming from being understaffed. Our room was thoroughly cleaned and therefore the deserve the one star. Lack of service is perhaps indicative of the direction California is going or it could just be lack management and training.<//text>

I loved the hotel and staff. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was great. The room was very nice and I enjoyed my stay but it was very pricey for a just ok experience.
When you typically check into a hotel you receive key infomearion about the hotel and amenities as well as local activities or things to do. You also typically get a menu of hotel pricing for add on services.. mini bar, in room ordering etc. I checked in and received my hotel room key and and didn't get any of this information. I know with covid everything should be contactless or paperless, so I just expected an email or digital form. It seemed there were a few qr codes in the room on a tiny handout but it was shrunk down too small to scan.. or possible Pixelated or distorted. Nothing in the mini bar had a price on it and I wanted to open some of the wine, but didn't know how much it was. I also figured I could order in room dining but didn't get a menu. I didn't know what was open or not in the hotel, as nobody advised me.
So I would suggest an update of current accommodations via email or printed out in rooms.
I also noticed there was no clock radio in the room. Although it's not necessary for all hotels, it's expected in higher end ones such as your hotel. I imaged sitting in my room with the sun coming in and relaxing to some tunes on the radio. There was no radio or option for music at all in the room. I honestly expected even a cheap clock radio of some sort. Cheaper hotels now offer blue tooth clock radios. So I just expected something.
I pre-ordered a charcuterie and cheese board and sparkling wine to be in room upon arrival.. that was on time. But the cheese was underwhelming. I thought maybe it would be a selection of cheeses, but the hotel chose and there was blue cheese chosen. Thats such a strong cheese I expect to be asked if I am OK with the choices. I couldn't eat the blue cheese as it was too strong and honestly a waste of money. I just wanted a bit more of a customized experience
The rooftop bar was awesome and had amazing views but there menu was lacking. I am a vegetarian and the only option was the impossible burger.. which you were out of. So I asked if I could have pasta without the shrimp and it was just unslated butter with noodles. It was pretty bad and I got charged full price even with out the shrimp.
Overall stay was nice, but for the price I paid I really expected a bit more</text>

<date>1610010907149< /date><Text>I was fortunate enough to spend a night at Archer Napa during my road trip from OR to Ca. I check in on 5/6/20 in room 519. The experience was phenomenal.  The hotel is located in the heart of Napa. I was so happy to see the location when I arrived at the hotel because everything was within walking distance.
When I arrived I was greeted with a smile by Valey Josue &  Juliette. They were very nice to give me enough time to get my stuff on the cart and helped me with all the questions about the area. Later I was greeted by Lauren at the Front desk. She was phenomenal, very engaging, and helpful. She went above and beyond in answering all the questions and helped me with the reservation for dinner.  Gabe in the Bell department & Humberto insecurity was also very helpful.
I had an amazing time, not just that but it was memorable for my family We will never forget how amazing the staff was. We will be back soon.

Last but not least, Upon check out, I was also lucky enough to meet the GM of the hotel who was super nice He asked me about my experience and feedback.<//Text>< Name>

<username>Mutale Kalulu</username><Date>1584325368412< /Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Do yourself a favor and order Mario’s girl at the Archer hotel. The rooftop bar called Sky and Vine is a good way to end a day of wine tasting. With a good happy hour menu and a large good selection of drinks the sky and vine is worth the visit. The cocktails do run a bit steep $$$ if you are used to out of town prices but it is definitely worth it.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuqMnS9er5lL6vh1k8VQ30kD80JQY8d1YG5M_x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyDGvQaaoItD1-siQbRW0ofGUO5ts2F3SVIJPw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Great Hotel, but watch your car.  Ours was in the care of Valet, and they brought it out with a 6" door dent, which occurred while in their care.  Their insurance company (Towne Park) supposedly reviewed the information and take no responsibility, even though I documented it right when they brought it out to me.  The fresh paint from another car door was easily wiped off with a finger, so it had very recently happened.  Sad to end a great hotel stay with that experience.< /text>

Felt welcomed on check in with a glass of Chandon which made everything better. The hotel foyer and lounge areas are very well done and look fantastic. We stayed in the deluxe King, the bed was luxurious and the towels felt so soft! The rainfall shower was a nice bonus. The room came with everything you need and lots of USB ports for charging. Our room had an empty wine fridge which is great to store your Napa wine.
Light sleepers will notice that the do not disturb button in your room is incredibly bright at night, but a couple sticky notes seemed to dim the light.
Our room was on the conference level which had a water bottle refilling station. Such a great idea!
Only downside is in the lounge area they were super busy at night so the service was hit and miss. But we were very well looked after by Kirby who was just amazing and totally made our night.<//text>

Very low water pressure.  A/C does not cool very well (shows 65, but feels like 75).  No vending machines (or sodas available for purchase).  Staff was very friendly, but they provide horrible directions.< /Review>< pictures>

First time at the centrally located Archer and it was a five  star experience with many dining choices within an easy walk.  The room was clean and spacious with wine refrigerator as a nice touch.   The bed was comfy and the widescreen TV was great. Service was impeccable. The concierge was very knowledgeable with good recommendations.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Location is perfect! As soon as you drive up to the hotel you are greeted by the valet and bell hops ready to park your car and take your bags. You immediately feel welcomed. There’s a full bar right next to Charlie Palmer steak house which is also located in the hotel lobby. The best steak with great sauce options of which you cannot go wrong eating here. Walking the room we were immediately amazed by the large sized bathroom including a large tub and separate large shower. The bed was a huge canopy bed of which I thought was amazing because you’re able to open and close the curtains on the canopy bed. On the balcony there are two lounge chairs and a fireplace of which we relaxed in our room provided robes and slippers.</review>< pics>

The hotel is severely understaffed. It’s a terrible experience at a guest. Everything from check in, check out, housekeeping, food and beverage is all a frustrating experience.

Front desk blames ‘we have one bellman serving over 100 rooms right now’ for the poor service. Don’t say a bellman ‘Will be there in 10 minutes’ if one won’t actually arrive for 25 minutes.< /text>

< Review>
Amazing hotel in the middle of downtown Napa with great service, beautiful rooms, but at a price. The rooftop bar and restaurant are pretty cool with great views of the city. On the weekend the bar is lively and popular with locals. We came up here for Sunday brunch and it is awesome. You get bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. You also get a fruit plate and a plate off cheeses and charcuteries.</Review>

<text>Great hotel with excellent design and cleanliness. We stayed in January which I believe is low season so it wasn't crowded at all, and we were allowed early check-in and late check-out. Rooms were clean with modern renovation. Bathroom door is a sliding door which doesn't really seal when closed so be aware if you mind privacy. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1579647110357, 'text': "Thanks so much for your lovely review, Blake!

Wow! Ngl at first I was kind of upset that this hotel was being built in my hometown, but as a visitor staying here I absolutely love it! The staff are all super accommodating and friendly and the rooms could not be more comfortable. This is a fabulous place to stay in the heart of downtown and I definitely recommend it.</review>

In this hotel, everything feels so nice！There is a gift for the dog in the room, which makes you feel so sweet. The front desk，valet and the smile of the restaurant all make people feel warm. All the details are so lovely that I like them so much that I spent an extra night here< /text>

Very welcoming hotel staff. The property and rooms were far nicer than even the pictures depicted. This was a great choice for the Napa segment of our 25th anniversary get away! We would highly recommend the Archer for a special occasion or just a weekend getaway, it will exceed your expectations.</Review>

Totally impressed. 5 star. All the employees treated us like stars, roof top bar was glorious, bathrooms were spotless, room service was top notch, valet was so helpful and not once did we open a door to enter or leave the hotel. Will stay here next visit to Napa.</text>

<Text>This hotel is much cooler and nicer than it appears on google search!

I had to stay at two different hotels over two nights due to availability.

When I arrived at the Archer Hotel, I noticed different and unique decorations and products on the wall.

Room was clean and roomy, had great Malin goetz products, and nespresso machine.  Cool boutique hotel.

I’ll def stay there again if I’m in town!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We stayed at the Archer for our 9-year anniversary recently and it was nothing short of amazing. I have to admit, I'm a pretty critical person (sometimes hard to please) but everything from the views, to the cleanliness, to the friendliness of staff, and the proximity to everything downtown... it was all perfection. I only wish we had stayed more than 3 nights here and less in San Fran! We can't wait to come back.<//review>

I just had the best spa experience to date. We requested the Archer Antidote, 90- minute service. It includes a massage, oxygen treatment, face mask and foot scrub, basically anything you may ever need/want all rolled into one.
Amber was my therapist (and I would request her again). She was very intentional about her massage pressure and areas of focus. I had a lot of stress in my neck and shoulders and she was able to release all the tension. She was professional, polite, but most of all a damn good massage therapist.
So happy with our entire experience, all members of our party came out from treatments raving about how good we felt. Thank you!< /review>

It is located in downtown lovely Napa. We did not stay here, but took a tour. The lobby is beautiful with a large sitting area and a big fireplace. On the top floor is an outdoor and indoor bar and lounge.  On the other side is a very shallow pool with lounge chairs in or out of the pool. Several fireplaces with sitting areas are very inviting.<//text>

WE didn't stay here but we did come up to the rooftop bar. It was beautiful at sunset and the drinks were very good. I had a gin/peach drink and it was yummy. The hotel looked great and it was in a perfect  location. I would stay here for sure.</Review>

<Text>The Archer is a nice hotel, but it should be exceptional. The arrival experience was smooth, but it should be extraordinary for the price, e.g. a welcome glass of wine.

On the plus side, it's a very nice hotel in terms of decor, the roof deck is beautiful. The rooms and the lobby are upscale and modern.

On the down side, our room was dirty, there was stuff on the floor. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were too flat. It was also very dark, but we had booked a lower tier room because we were only staying one night. The food on the roof deck was pitiful for Napa. It could be amazing, but it's very pedestrian.

I like the Archer, but expect more out of what we got.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfQQhRCHw4bFBHCMKDFIGu0NuhFkg4rdYtt0N6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Time>

Modern luxury comfort at it’s best possible “bestest”.From the “Do not disturb” button, to the complementary welcome caramels, the magic of this place will always be remembered. Not to mention, its incredible location. Simply Fantastic.<//text>

Loving every bit of the stay! The service, the room with balcony, the foods, the rooftop bar, best of all: the location!  It’s not cheap, but it’s worth the $$$. Wonderful hotel<//Text>

Incredible hotel for a short couple days spent in Napa. The rooftop restaurant patio with the Muskoka chairs and massive fireplaces is a spectacular spot for a glass of wine. Wish they had as inviting of a setup on the poolside where you can enjoy your own Napa bottles picked up along the way, but I’m definitely not complaining. Amazing spot!</Text>

<Text>Great location and great restaurant inside (Charlie Palmers). This is our second stay at the Archer and we love it. The only issue was the Bar at Charlie Palmers had great staff on our last stay. I mean exceptional and knowledgeable. This time they were substandard at best. We were there twice to eat at the bar and left a HUGE tip the first time to ensure a smooth visit. Apparently, the millennial Asian Man/boy who was working both times did not get the hint. And it appears that their slacker culture has hit the market. I worked behing the bar in the 80s and this kid would not have cut it. You are there to provide an experience and service. Learn the trade as you will use it in busienss later on in life(if you make it that far).< /Text><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808506678dbb4e9d:0x42e0b868a3373556<//gmap_id>< userid>

<text>The best service I’ve ever had at a hotel. Ever.
Breakfast is unmissable - try the lobster omelette. Every evening they bring you a different sweet and the tea provided at our conference was phenomenal. Even the chocolates at the check in counter is a step above, a sweet, soft chocolatey mint - delicious! I didn’t get to use the rooftop bar nor the workout areas but I heard they are amazing. Loved this hotel!!!</text>< rating>

On the property there is an amazing rooftop bar overlooking the surrounding hills, unfortunately for us, we found it a little dirty and unkept. The tables were not wiped down at all,the wait staff was not on the ball, and the manager looked stoned out of her mind. And our drinks, a white wine and a beer were served at room temperature. What a shame.<//Review><username>Orbitz reviewer<//username><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

The rooftop and cocktails can be pricey. Just bring a flask and fill your drink up in the bathroom, their fault for making everything expensive for locals. Their lobster cocktails are exquisite<//Review>

We are just leaving Napa after a long weekend and this hotel was a great find. The staff is supper friendly and the hotel has a good ambiance. The roof top is very nice and the shallow pool is cost and a good space to relax. The rooms are good size and the bed was comfortable. Also the location is convenient and close to food and little shops. Will be back!</Text>

Archer Hotel Napa is absolutely perfect. The staff is so accommodating and will do anything to ensure guests are pleased. Sara and Angie were terrific at checking us in. The check in was flawless. Our rooms were ready early. Our 7 rooms were immaculate and so comfy. The bed was comfy. The outdoor fireplace was so user friendly. The only thing I would have liked is more soaps and shampoo. It was a bit slim. The patio windows needed cleaning.
Jeff is a great manager and so kind and always greeted us so nicely. Gil, concierge, is fabulous. Anything you want she will make happen. She is so efficient and so good at her job. Loved working with her. Our brunch for 20 was perfect. I definitely recommend this beautiful place to stay.</Text>

Absolutely beautiful interiors. The room was up to date in every way and the bathroom was beyond clean. Staff were very helpful. Enjoyed sitting down in the lobby, having a drink and listening to the liver performer<//Text>

<text>If you're staying in Napa, I'd say opt for paying a tad bit more and book a central hotel like Archer! Extremely clean, great service, and in the center of downtown within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and attractions such as Oxbow market.

All of the wineries we visited were also within 15-20 minutes of the hotel, so it had the convenience of Napa Valley and also downtown. Definitely will be staying here again!<//text><Rating>5< /Rating>< date>

<rate>4< /rate><review>We had a wonderful stay at the hotel Archer. The rooms and the hotel are beautifully appointed. I loved all the natural Furnishings. It's very stylish. My room was sparkling clean and comfortable. I appreciate that they have high quality on hand in the lobby. We loved having little treats in the room like caramels, chocolate-covered fortune cookies and madelines.

The hotel is very busy in the evenings. The upstairs bar has a lot of traffic and people going in and out. I was very surprised and appreciative that my room was very quiet considering all the hoopla in the building.

There are spectacular views from the roof. My only regret is that we were here for a conference and it was nippy out and we didn't have time to enjoy the deck.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1525707666572, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Jackie.

Beautiful hotel, awesome service and wonderful rooms! We came here for the weekend with our two kids and our small dog and booked two rooms. We received a warm welcome by the valet and bellman upon driving in. Check in was a breeze and we dropped off our luggage and went downstairs for a drink and apps. Sat at a high table at the bar and ordered some delicious wines by the glass and those to die for lobster corn dogs! We left for dinner at a family member’s house and came back for a nightcap and chatted it up with the lobby bartenders for a bit and then up to bed where we slept wonderfully on the comfy beds. Saturday night we had reservations for 10 up at the sky lounge. Kirby was our sever and he was the best, super attentive, friendly and gave wonderful suggestions, his food runner/busser was very attentive too. Most of our guests were locals and they were very impressed with the none pretentious service and crowd.
We can’t wait to come back and stay! Thanks for the good times!< /Text>

We had a great stay at the Archer.  The location was great for walking around and exploring downtown Napa.  Close to several restaurants and shops.  The hotel and rooms were very clean and well kept.  The service was great.  Gil at the concierge was very helpful with all of our travel needs prior to our arrival, and had some great recommendations that made our trip a memorable one.  Thanks Gil, and everyone at the Archer.  Kirby on the rooftop was great too!</review>

The Archer Hotel Napa is an incredible hotel.  My wife and I stayed here for 2 days last week with some friends we all loved everything about it.  Service was excellent - in the same class as a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton.  Our favorite feature was clearly the rooftop bar but we also really liked the attention to detail throughout the hotel that made it unique to the area.  Floor to ceiling sliding glass doors with a fireplace in the rooms was a pretty nice touch too.  We are already planning our next stay here.</review>

This place rocks at night!  It’s a one of the only places that go off on every night in downtown Napa!  Arrive early afternoon and hit the pool, then happy hour.  Great food but limited food on the 6th floor, but great quality!  Highly recommend Archer Hotel.< /Review>

<Review>We spent 2 days at this hotel - located in downtown Napa - earlier this month.

Short version: The hotel itself, the service, and the vibe were great. We would stay again and would recommend it to others!

Long version: The hotel is new and has a well-decorated, spacious, open concept lobby area.

Our room was good and functional, although rather "cozy" (smallish in size). The shower was good - spacious and new. We had a Nespresso coffee set inside the room, which was a definite bonus.

Breakfast was served on their beautiful rooftop, though it can get seriously chilly in the morning (at 7am at least)! Staff brought gas heaters and some people brought blankets.

My husband attended some meetings while here and said their conference rooms were very well-equipped.

Note: The hotel is connected with Charlie Palmer Steak, which we dined at and enjoyed!

Would definitely return and highly recommend for a good stay to others.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is located downtown and seemed to be very lovely.</Review><Response>{'time': 1532616347287, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the lovely review, Aj!

< review>
Cookie, my friend, made reservations for brunch 5 days previous to 11/25 and when we arrived, they could not find them. Things went downhill from there. Service is poor, the brunch buffet food was cold, it took 10 minutes to get a latte, then arrived with no spoon or sugar.  It took another 10 minutes for the waitress to bring these.  Tiles on the outdoor (6th floor) patio are 'temporary' we were told, and my heel promptly got wedged between one of them.  The manager had to take a knife to move the tile to get my heel out.  A huge puddle of water was on the floor directly by my chair and I was told it was from the overnight condensation and it would be mopped up.  No one ever came so I had to put my napkin on the floor to sop up the water,  and no one ever took the menu's off the table. For all the 'millions' spent on this property, part of that should have been spent on training the wait staff to properly take care of clients, and the property should be finished before being open to the public. Needless to say, I will not be back.< /review>

Rooftop pool is non-existent...what area even has water and seating area isn't serviced by any food and drinks. Would not recommend staying here again. Out of 10 days in Napa it was our worst stay. Hospitality non-existent. Room view is of a another room room or blank white rooftop. Absolutely no view. Our honeymoon memories will not involve this stay.< /review>

A beautiful place in the heart of downtown Napa. Well-attended and very modern. Maybe not the rustic Napa feel I really like and see from places like the Meritage, but very nice nonetheless. And very convenient to everything Napa. I would stay here again and again - hotels don't get much better than this!< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Archer hotel in Napa was very nice! Out of the hotels on our travels this far, the service was incredible! They came around in the evening offering a snack and asked of we needed any fiji water.

We came back from wine tasting to find a lovely peanut butter cheesecake and a red wine on the table in our room.

There is a great breakfast place just 1 block away (nice walk) called Jax Diner. It is a must try!

Overall, Archer was fantastic (with plush towels) with friendly staff and thoughtful service. Will consider staying again!</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Phenomenal views of Downtown Napa and surrounding hills from rooftop pool, bar, patio, and gym but avoid their live music.

The lobby is equally impressive with a giant, beautifully rendered, topo map of all the wine districts, surveyable from a comfortable assortment of giant arched couches and chairs and circular bar.

Get a room with a view if you want natural light. The ones facing center can feel dark.

This place would get five stars except for their need to supplement the already perfect rooftop experience with really bad live music (think failing to hit high notes of Tears for Fears hits) that permeates the entire floor.

A setting like that needs nothing else and the bad music makes you leave one of the prime reasons for coming here despite all its other beauty.

If they must have live music, hire the phenomenal flamenco guitar player from Alexis Bakery down the street.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1571934475300, 'text': "Hi, Jody!

We loved everything about this hotel.  Our room was spectacular with a huge tub and wrap around outdoor balcony w/ fireplace.  They thought of every small detail to make sure our trip was enjoyable.  Service was top of the line.  We were there celebrating a birthday and wedding anniversary and they made sure to acknowledge that and even sent up a generous birthday surprise for me.  Their rooftop was awesome and we also enjoyed using the gym and pool area.  We can't wait to go back!</Text>

Beautiful hotel, lovely rooms, and fantastic location are all pluses here. The staff was very helpful and caramels, madeleines, and chocolates were nice touches. The only negatives: the plugs next to the bed didn't work, the AC was spotty and couldn't cool off the room effectively, and the valet parking can take up to half an hour to retrieve a car. Had we known, we would have called down, but we almost missed a tasting reservation on Sunday waiting for our car to be pulled up.</text>

Review is just for lurking. We actually didn't stay here. We were walking around downtown Napa and noticed that the hotel is open. With 45 mins to kill before our reservations, we hung out at the lobby. The lobby is beautiful!!!! The people working here are super friendly. We sat by the fire place and was very comfortable. We asked about the rooftop bar and was told they will open when the weather is warmer.

Definitely will return to check out the rooftop bar for drinks.</text>

<Review>Very nice establishment, appetizers and drinks were good. It was a Saturday night, so it was quite packed. We got there at 9pm and it was pretty full upstairs with no line below. When we left at 10:30 the line was huge, almost out the door to the entrance of the hotel. So get there earlier on a weekend night.<//Review>< pictures>

I seriously dream about coming back to this hotel! It is one of the best I've ever been to. Gorgeous ambiance.. the room was beyond amazing, including a gigantic soaking tub, separate shower,  and plenty of vanity space. The outside patio includes a gas fireplace and views of hot air balloons in the morning. Our room had an espresso machine that we enjoyed as well.  The nightly local treats delivered at turndown was a really fun touch, too. The restaurant inside the hotel is an absolute MUST! It's pricy, but probably one of the most incredible meals you'll ever have. We brought our own wine and didn't get charged a corkage fee. The rooftop bar has some delicious specialty cocktails which we enjoyed too... again, kinda pricy but worth it for the quality and atmosphere.</Review>

<date>1564845700374<//date><Text>Note - We stayed at this property due to an event taking place on the rooftop.

The rooftop view & bar, work out room, pool and location are definitely the highlights of this property.  The rooms are nice but so are several other hotels in the area, especially for the price.  We decided to dine at Charlie Palmer as we have eaten at two different Charlie Palmer restaurants and knew the quality of food.  A SWING AND A MISS at Archer.  It appear the main chef was out and the back up chef well .. they were not on their A or B game ... The dining area was not that busy yet food took 30 mins for soup that was cold and was sent back .. then we waited over an hour for scallops that .. yep cold too.  That's 90 mins for cold soup and cold scallops.   0 for 2.  Although  everyone was apologetic stating  'this is not up to our standards' we are a Charlie Palmer property blah..blah..blah and took the meal off our bill.  The experience left a sour taste as we have been to Napa many times, stayed at numerous properties who would have done so much more to change the experience other than taking that meal off our bill and apologizing it didn't meet their standards.

The last time we were in Napa we stayed at the Meritage Resort, when we arrived our room wasn't ready until 30 mins after they promised.  When we got to our room we had a bottle of wine, cheese plate, chocolate strawberries and they took $50 off our room just for a 30 mins sanfu ... Hummmm Archer may want to take the same customer service classes Meritage Resort has been taking.<//Text><user_name>Susan Wright</user_name><rating>3< /rating></record></dataset><record>

The interior is modern and stunning, with a huge topographical map of Napa Valley dominating the wall of the lounge. The restaurant is overpriced for what it offers, even for Napa. There is no cab sauv by the glass, which is highly unusual. Overall, everything was pretty comfortable and the staff is attentive.< /Text>< Pictures>

The standard room is well appointed with nice bed and nice bath. The view we had wasn’t a view
Enclosed area :(. It’s located in great area of town
Enjoy a nice walk to Napa river walk along river and stop at Napa farm market for a nice breakfast.</review>

The service is not great, requests frequently get lost or delayed, and despite plenty of staff, it's often impossible to contact the reception desk at all. The rooftop pool is exactly 10 cm deep: there's no way anyone can swim in it.
The rooftop bar is rather nice, and offers nice food, wine, and cocktails.
Some floors have an amazing art exhibitions in the corridors - well worth seeing.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808506678dbb4e9d:0x42e0b868a3373556<//gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1531406145516, 'text': 'Hi, Christian!

The Hotel Archer in Napa, CA exceeded all expectations!

The room was amazing!  The tub was enormous, seriously had to be close to 8’x3’.  A separate walk-in shower and double sinks and lots of space perfect for the traveling couple.  And, That is just the highlights from the bathroom!  This hotel was extraordinary throughout.  We were traveling for my wife’s birthday and the staff went the extra mile to make it a special for her.  Thank you, and hats off to the team at Hotel Archer, Napa.<//Text>

Came in to check out the Sky & Vine Rooftop Bar... if you want service at a table or one of the fire pits, you'll need to book reservations. Walk-ins are welcome for either of the 2 bar areas and the standing area at the larger one is perfect for enjoying a cocktail and taking in the perfect scenery. This place gets packed at sundown on warm nights, thanks to it's breathtaking view of the sun setting beyond the backdrop of the Napa hills. Drinks and food of course are going to be on the more pricey end for this kind of experience and the staff definitely takes for granted that the tourists coming in will tip large regardless of the service level. That was the only major disappointment. Service was very, very slow despite ample staff on hand. Worth checking out on occasion and perfect for groups wanting a view and comfort but not ideal if you expect the high level of service offered at the many other establishments in Napa.< /text>

Very disappointing stay.
Our first impression of the lobby and room were outstanding. Unfortunately everything went down hill from there. My wife and I encountered numerous issues which make us discourage anyone from staying here. During our short stay we had the following issues; false fire alarm at 6am, air conditioning, tv and fire place did not work, room service did not answer our call for 10 minutes and then the food which was horrible arrived 30 minutes late and a maid entered the room without knocking. Most of these issues were brought to the attention to the front desk who had to be notified multiple times before they helped. For as nice as the ambiance of this hotel is the service and experience was horrible and not recommended.</review>

Paid for the STEAKation coupled with the room with the balcony and fireplace. I thought it would be nice to enjoy after choosing the bottle we enjoyed the most after the tasteings ...got back to the room to find that our fireplace didn’t work . After dinner we had to call and have a guy come up and fix it multiple times :-/ F’ed up the mood of the night! The next morning our voucher was not added to our bill...we checked out 30 mins ago and are still waiting for it to be resolved.  Upset to say the least!</Review>

Fantastic hotel. The bed was one of the most cokmfortable I've slept in. Warm and friendly staff at the desk. The valet staff as a whole were phenomenol. Peter, behind the bar is very friendly, helpful and makes you feel like part of the community even if you're only here for a few days. It's nice to not be stressed about your stay on vacation. Oh and the last thing: happy hour lobster corn dogs. Make sure you have them. Every day.< /Text>

I did not stay at the hotel but was hoping to enjoy the rooftop bar with friends. Was disappointed to learn that they shut it down at midnight.  :(</Review>

<Review>We just celebrated my wife's bday at The Archer Rooftop and I have to say we got some of the best customer service. Special thanks to our Bartender for our event Christopher, he was always ready to take another order and fast at making some of the best cocktails I've had. He anticipated people's needs and remembered many people's specific drinks without being told twice.

I would also like to thank David our chef for the evening who whipped us up some of most tasty pasta dishes. David was very friendly and made sure to engage with our guests as well as went above and beyond by getting shredded fresh cheese from downtowns as a last minute request. I would recommend David to anyone looking for a chef.

Lauren with banquets as well as Katana were wonderful and need to also be recognized for exceptional service. Katana was always so kind and helpful with all our requests. Katana anticipated our needs before we even could ask, that's the kind of service you expect in Napa. Both were great to meet and glad we had them on our special event.

I'd recommend the customer service and hospitslity of The Archer Hotel to anyone.

Now, the room we stayed in 443 was adequate. The only two problems we had were the bathroom rolling door fall off the track twice which is a hazard cause could hurt someone. I lifted it to place it back on track. The second was we forgot to put the DND light one and housekeeping tried to walk in early. Knocked once tried to open the door which was locked then announced as they had the door cracked open cause of the lock stopping the door from opening completely.

Overall, I'd stay there again!</Review><Resp>{'time': 1545859352679, 'text': "Hi, Ric! Thank you so much for your thoughtful review.

<Text>The Archer was a beautiful hotel with awesome wine. But unfortunately, the  management staff was rude and unreliable as they did not provide the proper services:
1. I requested flowers and balloons to be there prior to my arrival and they failed to do so, ruining the special surprise planned.
2. When asking for bell services we basically had to load our own car; even after tipping the guy. Moreover, when finally receiving help from valet services to load our baggage, they spilled water from our delayed flowers onto many important files needed that day, which cost us a 2 hour delay on our trip: as we had to sit and pat down each and every file as they only watched us and didn’t offer to help with the damage they caused.
3.Their assistant manager, Humberto, constantly argued back instead of trying to comprise with the customer and was very unprofessional.
I have never before dealt with such poor management and was surprised when they continuously argued back, even when they were at fault.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

The management at this hotel must be very short sighted.  It's a huge 180 room property - but all single King beds.  No standard doubles to be found.  They only offer a few Double King rooms priced at more than twice the standard rate.  What a dumb decision and they are going to lose a lot of business to plenty of other hotels in the area that offer consumers more choices.</Text>

<Text>Nice location and the food at Charlie Palmer's was good. We could not get service at happy hour, very understaffed. The room was very small  for near $300.00 a night. Bed was like a rock. HVAC very noisy, many items in the room did not work properly. We will stick with Andaz down the street or the Westin.<//Text>< Pictures>

Horrible service during the day; bar staff loading dishwasher rather than serving and then have attitude. No one waiting tables. This place shouldn't be classed as four star. Avoid.< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent designer hotel built and decorated with good taste! At the entrance is an excellent entrance group with polite staff. For California residents, ask about a special discount on local ID. A steak house and a fireplace on the ground floor complements the experience, along with diva music. On the roof is a panoramic bar and a recreation area with water, very stylish. The rooms are new, comfortable, many compliments. Some rooms have a balcony and a fireplace, which enhances the impression of a holiday in this hotel. A refrigerator for wine is probably a feature of Napa, wherever you go - a test room, it's easier to find a test of wine on the street than to drink a cup of coffee — about 5: 1).
Location is the very center of the City ... everything is within walking distance, I recommend it very conveniently.
A book about the Little Prince in each room with an elusive touch complements the atmosphere ...
But carefully look at the resettlement and the view from the windows, if you are settled with a view of the supermarket, there is a repair next to it, be prepared to wake up at 6:30 due to the noise of the work of cargo machinery and construction noise ...

(Original)
Отличный дизайнерский отель построенный и оформленный с хорошим вкусом! На входе отличная входная группа с вежливым персоналом. Для жителей Калифорнии спрашивайте про особую скидку по местному айди. Стейк-Хауз и камин на первом этаже дополняет впечатления, вместе с дивой музыкой. На крыше панорамный бар и зона отдыха с водой, очень стильно. Номера новые, удобные, много комплиментов. В части номеров есть балкон и камин, что усиливает впечатление от отдыха в этом отеле. Холодильник для вина это видимо особенность Напы, куда не пойдёшь - тестовая комната, проще на улице найти тест вина, чем выпить чашку кофе- примерно 5:1).
Расположение- самый центр Города... все в пешей доступности, очень удобно рекомендую.
Книга про Маленького принца в каждом номере неуловимым штрихом дополняет атмосферу...
Но внимательно смотрите за расселением и видом из окон, если вас поселили с видом на супермаркет, рядом с ним происходит ремонт, будьте готовы проснуться в 6:30 по причине шума работы грузовой спецтехники и строительного шума...</Text>< gmap_id>
