We enjoyed the class while sheltering in place! We have ballroom-danced a lot so it was very beginner for us but all the stretches were good for us anyway. Really enjoyed re-learning the waltz steps again. It has been years. I just would’ve liked to learn maybe a couple variations including arms and legs together, but I understand you didn’t know everyone. Still a nice time. Thank you Christopher; really appreciate it!<//text>

We felt the couple game went too long so we left early because we weren't sure how long the last game would last and interrupt other couples.<//text><UserId.>110856967208576300829< /UserId.><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x808febfda3e204db:0x87d8e9eac4fa7b54</GmapID>< resp>

My husband and I took lessons with Christopher Li for our first dance. We signed up for twelve lessons, and we enjoyed every session with Chris.  He not only choreographed our first dance, but he choreographed another routine for us that we wanted to surprise our guest with.  This dance is called Marinera, a Peruvian coastal dance - a graceful, romantic couple dance that uses hanker-chiefs as props. Chris had no prior experience with this type of dance, but he did his research and delivered when teaching us our routine! We're so grateful for Chris. He really taught my husband how to lead, and taught us a lovely dance that our family and friends will always remember!< /Review>

My husband and I got married last summer and knew early into our wedding planning that we wanted to have a unique first dance. We had the song picked out and a vision of being surrounded by family and friends holding sparklers while the sun sets. Neither of us were confident enough to choreograph our own dance routine so we researched studios in the area we could take lessons at. We were so impressed after our complimentary consultation at Mark Ballas with Zach and Chris, we signed up for a private 10-lesson package.

We felt a little out of our comfort zone at first since we aren't the best dancers and had never done anything like this before, but our instructor Chris was very patient and encouraging with us. Other instructors that were in the studio at the same time would also watch our routine and offer motivation. Chris broke up the routine into manageable sections for us to easily learn while still having fun, and after 10 lessons we couldn't believe the progress we made and confidence we built.

I had high expectations for how our first dance would turn out, and they were far exceeded when we finally performed at our wedding. Not only was it easily one of the most memorable moments of the night, but the most memorable experience throughout our entire wedding planning process. Chris and the Mark Ballas team are talented, professional and friendly, and made us feel like part of their family. I highly recommend this studio for anyone looking to choreograph a one-of-a-kind first dance for their wedding as well!< /text>

<text>Tender kind patient instructors.  If you have always dreamed of learning how to dance but your are little nervous (or a lot!) this is the venue for you!  There are those that want to be social and dance while doing so. There are others that really want to become a dancer!  Options for both are here  - including fun group lessons. And if you really want to learn and have it stick with you for the rest of your life, I high recommend individual sets of lessons.  Sure...they cost more than group lessons.  But what is the value of a fulfilled dream?  I fulfilled mine.  It will always be worth it. Recommend Rachel for West Coast Swing.  Amazing journey and great results!< /text><gmapID>0x808febfda3e204db:0x87d8e9eac4fa7b54< /gmapID></record>

I stopped in to see if we could possibly sign up for a quick intro lesson before our son's wedding - didn't want to feel completely lost on the dance floor.  Everyone here is very friendly and our lesson with Rachel and Danielle was great!  They made us feel very comfortable as beginners and packed a lot into our lesson.  We were able to learn some steps to the songs we have chosen for mother/son, and first dance for the bride and groom.  And, my husband and I learned a few moves as well.  It was a lot of fun!  Thank you again!</Text>

If you're looking for a dance studio that can teach you almost any dance style while being your dance family & home away from home, you've found it! I've been working here as a teacher for almost half a year and I have never been happier. The clients are all lovely, the staff is incredible, and everyone works hard and has fun together while maintaining a stress-free and pressure-free environment. We're still small enough to give you a lot of individual attention, but we're also growing fast. Excellent place to work, fun place to dance, and the best place to learn and grow your dance skills!<//review>

Prices are very fair for the area and the quality of the lessons is fantastic. I have a very good relationship with all the staff members as they are friendly, helpful and always willing to put in the effort to go the extra mile for their students. I cannot recommend this place highly enough and suggest that if you are even slightly interested in anything they have to offer, come by and give them a chance! You wont regret it!</Review>

I can't say enough good things about the Mark Ballas Studio for ballroom dancing! Amazing instructors who all seem to be very passionate about what they do. They are quick to dance with beginners and are very encouraging. I went to a belated Valentine's  dance tonight and they put on a heck of a great, clean, fun party which is amazing in this day and age. They make sure people without partners get to dance. Their prices for lessons are very reasonable. I live in Livermore and could go to the Arthur Murray studio here but I choose to drive to Pleasanton several nights a week because of the quality I get at Mark Ballas.

Another thing I like is that instructors will dance together occasionally to demonstrate where you can get if you stick with it. For me, that gets me excited about my own possibilities on the dance floor. They talk about becoming part of their "dance family" and after only four times taking lessons and one party I honestly feel like I'm becoming part of it. That might sound corny but it's a tribute to how well all the staff, not just the instructors, reach out to folks.

On a logistics level, they have ample parking, greats dance floors (two different rooms), wonderful front desk staffing, are prompt to return calls, a great website, clean restrooms (even stocked with hand lotion, deodorant,  hairspray, etc.) and a level of enthusiasm that's hard to find in a service oriented business.

Can you tell I'm  sold on this place? I honestly can't currently think of even a suggestion I could give them on how to improve. Trust me, I'm not being paid to write this nor am I an employee, spouse, etc. I  NEVER, EVER write or have written a review like this about any business or service!!! I'm simply 20 star impressed about a 5 star situation. If you don't believe what I'm saying, come experience it yourself, first hand.

I feel totally stoked to have come across this place at a time in my life that has recently been full of unexpected change. Thank you Mark Ballas folks for being there right when I needed you! And thank all of you out there who have taken time to read this review. I haven't been this passionate about something in a long time!</Text>

<text>That was my 1st dance lesson in over 20 years and honestly I was really scared and not sure what to expect. Everybody was friendly and encouraged me to try new moves, which proved to be challenging and satisfying at the same time....signed up for more group lessons and some private lessons as well.< /text>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>What can I say about this East Bay Dance Academy? Let me list the top 3 things in my mind and summarize why I think it is among the best places for not only dance instruction but an overall fun place to enjoy a social event. 1) Top-notch instruction: Clearly you must be excited to see world-class Instructors teaching the classes. Beginning or Intermediate levels. Privates too. All are taught by excellent Instructors. They surely can dance and technically have the understanding for the craft, but to be able to break it down into simplest forms, make it engaging and fun at same time, and offer progress and improvement on the student's part? Well this takes special teachers. I have taken 2 very different types of classes here. One was American Rumba and the other West Coast Swing. Both were fantastic. 2) Schedule of variety of dance classes: this is not your local gym or community center. It is a professional dance studio and academy really. I call it this to distinguish its intent. As far as my humble eye can see this place really wants to make a serious dancer more serious. A completely shy and introverted beginning dancer more open and confident. And a socially awkward but keenly interested in the art of dance type of student more capable than what s/he would initially believe. 3) Cool Vibe: C'mon now. Dancing is cool. It can be intimidating especially when done at a high level but it is just outright cool to do, watch, learn, socialize..etc. My background is a fitness and martial arts lover. I attend One World Jiu Jitsu in Newark and its affiliate AKA (American Kickboxing Academy) in Sunnyvale. I know the best of the best. No ego. Openness. Welcoming attitude to ALL. Unless you are a stinky bum off the streets you will be welcome. High caliber is humble and full of grace. I also was recently accepted into a Latin American focused dance company. But I auditioned out of passion and a love for it. Not so much experience at all because I had zero in terms of the specific dance style. Afro-Haitian-Cuban Salsa and also rumba. It is SF based so I commute but for East Bay I choose Mark Ballas. Just come try a class or drop in and observe first. I guarantee you will love it and be inspired to learn more. It only takes 1 good class (and they are all good here) to make you into a better dancer! Bring a positive attitude and do not worry so much...you will be great.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808febfda3e204db:0x87d8e9eac4fa7b54<//gmapID></record>

The catchy store name "Geeky Clean PC" caught my attention, but the customer service (via phone initially) got me into the store, and what a breath of fresh air!! Not a typical reviewer, but this shop deserves the recognition. I interacted with 3 employees on the date I did business - via phone twice and at their office to have my MacBook Pro serviced. Every single one of those interactions were above and beyond (does that even happen in real life these days?!). While fixing my laptop they also answered numerous general questions I had about caring for it properly. Such a friendly group, knowledgeable, and they worked quickly. It's clear to me they pride themselves on delivering unmatched customer service, and really gave me that small hometown business feel. Put it on your list as your trusted local shop, you most definitely will not be disappointed!!</text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>First, they answered the phone!  Always a good start and were professional.  Asked enough questions to thoroughly understand the problem statement, then determined the best way to resolve.  Created and sent the appropriate documentation to indicate that I was on the schedule for service, then called on-time for our remote session.

Thank you Geeky Clean.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

They not only work in a punctual and timely manner at reasonable prices, but also bring high quality and expertise to their work as well. Alex was extremely knowledgeable and kind. I will definitely be recommending my friends if they are ever in need of computer repair jobs.

Last year, Ron helped me recover some photos from an old external hard drive and put everything on my usb for me.  These guys do great work and very friendly.  Bonus point for their dog welcoming me too<//Review>

Ron was very professional and helped me with my slow MacBook pro and ensured me that all my data and passwords would carry over if i was to upgrade to a ssd. My computer is running faster as it was when i first got it and its a 2011. Thanks guys, highly recommended!<//Review>

<review>My son chromebook from school turned off and never turned back on and desperately needed it to work again so he can finish his studies online.  We aren't very techy but they were able to take a look at it and lended us a loaner laptop for my son to use and then within the next day it was ready for pick up.  We are just glad they are open during these tough times.<//review><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80dc01c82d92508f:0x2cccd0e7c2fba2e0< /GmapID><rate>5</rate><name>RAUL GUZMAN< /name></record>

Ron upgraded my slow HP laptop and my mouse felt like it was possessed like it had a mind of its own.  He told me he detected viruses and removed them and then he upgraded my old hard drive.  Now it feels like a brand new computer again and opening up multiple things are a breeze.  Friendly and chill guys that are very attentive, knowledgeable, and great customer service!< /text>

My toshiba external hard drive couldn't read anymore and i was so worried and concerned because my whole life was on that hard drive.  All my pictures from the last 10 years, music, and documents i thought was all gone.  I dropped off my hard drive, prayed, and waited.  2 weeks later, i got a call and they said they recovered almost everything.  What a peace of mind and i'm glad i called around because they were cheaper than other places i have called.  I'm a happy camper :)< /Review>

Alex was extremely helpful fixing my Macbook! I knocked a cup of water onto it and brought it in the next day. He provided an estimate quickly and was able to fix the LCD and Logic Board. Don't ask me what they are though!! I would highly recommend Geeky Clean PC for any tech problems< /Text>

Ron was a lifesaver.  My business computer crashed and he was able to get it up and running the same day.  He was also able to install Windows 10 on my laptop when Dell said it was not compatible.  I will definitely keep going back to Geeky Clean PC to keep my computers running smoothly.  Thanks again for all the help.  Thomas<//Text>

Honest, fair pricing, and very helpful to this old broad who is not very techno-savvy.  I found Geeky Clean through a nonprofit shared office space.  My colleagues raved so much about the services and team, I gave them a try when I needed help with my personal laptop.  My experience was so positive, I've been back for help with other computer issues.  I've worked with Scott, Alex and Ron and the results have been the same with each - exemplary service; repairs done right the first time; pricing within my budget.< /text>

<Review>I had a virus on my hp laptop and every time i turned it on i felt like i was getting hacked or tracked.  I also had a iphone that was disabled and  it said to plug into itunes but nothing happens.  Ron was incredibly friendly and attentive to my issues.  He kept me updated and told me he did a clean install of windows 10 and also factory resetting the iphone 8 i can donate to my family member.  Now my laptop is back to normal and he educated me on what i could do to prevent this from happening again.
I'm so relieved and thankful because i didn't know what to do.  I was referred to them by family and i will also refer them to my family and friends.<//Review>< Rating>

I'm currently self-employed and these guys diagnose my laptop and informed me that my hard drive died and upgraded it to a solid state drive which i have no idea what that means - but it's running faster than before.

Great staff -- professional, courteous, and knowledgeable. With their location off Balboa Ave in Pacific Beach, its great to get some sun on a stroll on the beach while having them fix your computer issues. I recently purchased a laptop that was accidentally missing the Windows product key; they ordered the key immediately and even upgraded me from Home to Pro for my inconvenience.</text>

<review>My Macbook Pro died and I feared the worst. I called on a Sunday night and left a message after reading some great reviews. Ron called me the next morning and assured me all my data would be fine and even gave me a very reasonable quote over the phone. I dropped it off at lunch time and had it back the next day working with a new HD power cable, solid state HD and all my data restored for a very fair price. Really stoked on this business!  I highly recommend them to anyone.</review><Time>1578887916637<//Time>< Gmap_id>

Alex and Ron are SUPER professional. I was so devastated when I realized that my hard external is not working which I had all my pictures and memories in there. I was told that either is not fixable or it would be very very expensive to get it recovered. With no hope I found these life savers online and base on their reviews I went to their office. They explained all the chances and choices to recover or save my hard external. They also texted me couple of times due to my high level of anxiety and kept me updated. And within a day they saved all my information and pictures. I am so thankful and highly recommend them to all of you looking computer specialist. And the last not the least their prices are AMAZING for what they do.<//review>

Great friendly customer service, I was sold a LG phone here but my phone carrier rejected the data. They refunded me back no questions asked, i will definitely consider their repair services when I do need any repair work. The plus side is they are dog friendly so my pugs got along with their pug.</Review>

Fast, friendly and straight to the point type service. I received my laptop back sooner than quoted, which is always a good customer service tactic. Under-promise over-deliver. Would recommend to anyone having issues with a Mac product.< /text>

Sent in a corrupted drive. He updated me with the varying steps he was taking and always gave me a clear sense of expectations. In the end the drive was unrecoverable but I wasn't charged for any of the attempts made. Would definitely come back! [but hopefully won't need to!]<//Review>

After not needing Geeky Clean PC - Pacific Beach's services for several years, I was so glad to see they were still going strong on San Diego.  The long list of positive reviews say all I could and I'm adding my name to the list.  I trashed my Mac Retina display and they made it look like new again.  Geeky Clean PC - Pacific Beach will always be my first call.< /review>

No double talk from these guys they know what they are doing. Not often do you get computer guys that are not trying to run up your bill. I left a Mac with them on Friday they were done on Monday. I work in post production and need my Mac they worked on it over the weekend for me. Not your average repair company.< /text>

Brought my 3rd business computer to Geeky Clean PC in the past 2 years. Service has been excellent each time. My 2011 iMac now runs better than when it was new since they upgrade the RAM while replacing the HD. Thanks Nate, Alex & Scott!< /Review>

Was in San Diego for business and walked into the Geeky Clean PC store and met a young man named Devin.  WOW is all I can say, I am not computer savvy and just picked up a new Gateway laptop and he had me straightened out and all my problems were solved in 15 minutes.  Would recommend this company to anyone that is in need of computer or laptop issues.</Text>

This is the second time i've had to take my computer in. They are professional, fast, and compared to some of these big chain stores extrememly reseasonble in their prices. Excellent work. My computer works better now than when i bought it. Thanks Devin. Geeky clean are the best.< /Text>

<review>I went to Birdsmart today to check them out.  I was very pleased with Kara and other workers there.  I went in to check on parakeets and was very pleased with the selection of birds.  They told me that they raise and trained the babies which most bird stores don't do.  The bird supplies were plentiful.  I will be back soon to get our new trained bird.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Unfortunately, I went to this store today and had a bad experience with an employee as soon as I walked in. I felt unwelcomed and rejected. As a potential customer, I would not spend my money here as a result of this experience.

I love business and I love animals, two things I'm extremely passionate about.

To the owners and employees: I understand times are hard right now but please treat your customers with respect.

(I gave two stars versus one star because the last time I visited another employee made me feel welcomed and appreciated from the moment I walked in. That other star is for her)< /Text>

< Review>
they really know their stuff! the atmosphere in this place is wonderful, you get the sensation that these people love what they do, and that you're in a true family business. I had no idea what I was getting into when adding a feathered buddy into the family, but the staff was more than happy to guide me to the process. Also, I know now that this will be my one stop shop for everything bird related, as they seem to carry just about anything I think I may need. Cheers to them!< /Review>

Smaller than when they were Bird Crazy with limited supply. But the employees were friendly and willing to assist you. Bird seeds are plenty but the bird selection to buy is limited to smaller birds. No medium or large sized parrots were available to buy.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Ordered a bird cage from them that was supposed to take 2-3 weeks to arrive. The young lady who initially helped me was nice and said I’d receive a call when it was ready. 3 weeks went by with no call to inform me of a delay or anything so I decided to call. Called and was told we had to wait a few more days and they would call me back to keep me updated. Never got a call back, again. I gave an extra day to call them back myself. Called and was told they didn’t know if my order was there so call AGAIN the next day. Called the next day and they said it was ready for pick up. Picked up the cage and it was not assembled. Felt rushed out of the store with no apology or acknowledgment of “miscommunication” or anything. Brought the cage home and now had to figure out how to assemble it, which all the other orders they had in the store appeared to be assembled. Mine was the only boxed cage I saw. Instruction are terrible and confusing. Comes with different size screws but doesn’t show which one goes where. Definitely will not be returning to this store anymore. Such a shame too because I used to love it when it was Bird Crazy.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>We’re excited to say there are two fun additions to our family. Jack and Jill sing like canaries…because they are canaries! These two birds are beautiful, and we’re just thrilled to have them at our house. Canaries have been revered for millennia for their lovely appearance and their even more lovely song. In literature, legend and art; canaries have represented joy, hope and love. They were brought to Europe by Spanish sailors in the late 15th Century and from the 1700s, they have been pets, genetically distinct from their wild ancestors. With a soft and melodious song that is much more accessible and enjoyable than the songs and calls of larger birds, Canaries prove that the best things are not necessarily the biggest.

The symbolism of song birds is especially remarkable. Song birds have represented love, of course. They also represent music, and it is even common to refer to a beautiful singer as a canary. We are very happy to know that our home will be filled with their music and that we will be able to take care of these beautiful creatures and learn just a little more about this wonderful world in which we live. I want to wish all of you a great day filled with song and characterized mostly of all by happiness😊< /Text><Time>1576868810545< /Time>< pictures>

I was in need of a beak trim for my bird and they did it right away. The bird is happy now and so am I. The prices for their services are very reasonable. I would recommend this place to all the bird owners.
Edit- they now charge $20 flat fee for any kind of grooming. That's insane if you, like me, have a small bird. I needed the beak trimmed. It took literally 30 seconds to do it. For $16 I bought an electric grooming device which I now use for my bird.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Bird Smart is a great place to get a wonderful pet bird. They have seed, cages, toys and the most beautiful birds ever seen. Staff are great and very knowledgeable. If you need help they're more than willing to help you. I like the store and I've been dealing with these folks for 30 years now. Check it out.< /Review>< time>

<Text>They are so loving with their animals! Yes they have babies there but wont sell them until they are ready. They do hand feed them so they are just to humans. The bird that has plucked feathers from the other review didn’t even ask about the bird. He was relinquish there already having issues and he has improved a lot! They have awesome birds and boarding too. Half the birds there are boarding and they look to have fun being able to stare at other birds!< /Text>< pics>

We've bought TWO painted conures there. Ginny, Lorna and their staff knows their stuff and hands raises the birds to be sweet & loving. BirdSmart deserves 10 starts.<//text>

Visited this store recently.  I'm sad to report that this shop could use a lot of improvement.
I've raised birds for decades and unfortunately the shop needs to take more care with the cages and cleanliness.
Yes birds do make a lot of mess, but several of the cages had 1.5" of droppings, old food, muck, etc. encrusted at the bottom.
Some of the birds being boarded did not look healthy at all.
There were many cages on the floor (or barely above it) where a solitary bird would be.  That's the coldest, dustiest, part of any place, with absolutely nothing to see or be stimulated by.
Prices were fair, and the staff was helpful, but honestly, Petco takes better care of their animals and cages.<//Review>

San Diego has only 1 good choice for exotic birds. Typically hand fed and very sweet family pets. We got our Painted Conures and White belly Caique there!</review>

There were many unhealthy birds in this store. Many of them had plucked feathers. There was even one dead finch on the bottom of one cage and when I told one of the workers about it, the worker simply took the bird out and said that it sometimes happens when they fight! After that terrible visit, I decided to never enter that shop again.<//Text>

<review>less than one star. the place is filthy. tiny feces caked cages full of sad sick looking birds. has to be some kind of illegal bird mill because nobody that cares about any live animal can justify the conditions of this store. all the birds here pick at their feathers to some degree and the babies in the dusty smelly "nursery" look weak and underweight. to top it off the employees are extremely rude and act like they don't want or need to help you.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The absolute least welcoming most depressing bird store in San Diego . I enjoy visiting different bird stores since I've wanted a pet bird for ages but don't have the means to own one and this store was so dissapointing. I usually go to Feathered Friends or Free Flight(both great bird-loving establishments) but I was having dinner at Sorrentinos and had heard about this place and decided to check it out. Instant regret. It was a hot Sunday afternoon and this place was at least 10 degrees hotter inside.The smell of neglected bird cages hits immediately and overpriced product is the majority of the store. All the birds were all cramped against a wall in very dirty cages and they had 3 birds out on some cramped stands waaaay in the back. I was in this place for about 10 minutes before I had to walk out because of the smell and 90 degree heat and the only acknowledgment I got was from a blonde employee who kept giving me a look like she wanted me to stop interacting with the birds. Won't be back. Hope this place gets shut down by the proper authorities because the birds in there do not deserve to be living in such terrible conditions.<//Text>

By the time I could take her home she was so sweet and loving. She is my love! Healthy, funny, loving sweet & so smart. At 7 month says: whatchadoin? love you, mama, nightnight, pretty girl, Marilyn (her name) and my favorite of all she walks up to me & says LOVE & puts her head down to love on me & get petted & loved on.

I visited this bird store on a Saturday morning and found everything filthy dirty. The staff never came up to see what they could do to help me and in fact they were just playing around with each other. None of the staff were interacting with the birds who appeared neglected.
Needless to say I would never step foot back in this place and hope that they get closed down for the squalor the birds are living in.<//Review>

Great staff with a great selection of birds. It's obvious they enjoy being around birds, taking care of them and assisting less "bird knowledgable" people with decision making. They have toys, many different kinds of food and parrots out for anyone to play with. Overall, it is a pleasant experience and i highly recommend this place for any of your avian friend needs.</text>

horrible experience at this place today. got yelled at by a female employee who didn't even greet me when i came in the door. I wondered about looking at the very small selection of overpriced toys and WILDLY overpriced seed for about 5 minutes and nobody engaged me. nothing looked interesting, everything was dusty, and it smelled like the cages hadn't been cleaned in a LONG WHILE, so i was walking towards the exit and i took my phone out to take a picture with the only nice looking bird they had out             (a young looking amazon) and the same lady that scurried to the back room when i came in yells 'NO PHOTOS!!!' from the waay back of the store. HOW EMBARRASING. there were 2 other custumers checking the birds in the cages out and we all exchanged a look of shock at this employees rudeness, so i apologized and hurried out the door.</Text>

This place is very knowledgeable about birds and has some of the best selection during the spring. Almost, if not all of there baby birds are hand fed and raised.  It is conveniently​ located right off the Freeway.<//review>

They only had one bag of it in stock and it took almost 15 minutes for an employee to come assist me. Most of all the birds in there were missing feathers, saw one of the employees yell at a customer for taking a picture and I felt like I was going to lose my mind with all the noise.< /review>< pics>

Hand raised birds and loving people who raise them.  Also plenty of birds to see and love on when you need your birdie fix.<//text>

I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to get a bird. I love how the birds are out and interacting with people daily. They give these birds lots of love and care they need. I bought my cinnamon green cheek conure and crimson rumped toucanet here and they are my babies. I come often to this place for my birds wings, nail trimmings and food.<//text>< Pics>

They were only 4 months old. I followed every step that BirdSmart instructed and it only lead to downfalls of my birds. I would not recommend coming here. There birds are cramped up in small cages and there's too many of them. There place was dirty when I went in and the bird cages were filthy. 100% a no go to coming back. The best part is, BirdSmart did nothing to help me.<//Review>< resp>

<Response>None</Response><date>1535150727848< /date><text>THIS REVIEW IS A LESS THAN 1 STAR. Plus the reviews that are below is from the old store where they were much better, but now they just dont care about you or the Birds, so sad 😞😟. I have sent many of my Clients to Birdsmart in the past, to the old store. Now proven to be Birdumb because the last Client that I refered, which never had a Bird before, visited  the store (they needed a very unique Bird)  and I told Lorna 1 hr before my Client got to the store, that I was the Customer and I needed to approve of Any Bird  My Client wanted, (Lorns excuse is my Client payed for it, so to bad) so we didn't get what we got, which was a Screaming Bird most of the time. My Client understood No refunds, Store Credit Only. Now Lorna says she would only give My Client a Cockateel a $50. Bird, compaired to a $1,100. Cockatoo. My Cleint was so disappointed she gave Lona the Bird. Then Lorna  GAVE, at no charge the $1,100, Bird to her friend because it was uncontrollable, to be in the Store. So we will take Birdsmart to Court, and win. My advice to Anyone that wants to buy a Bird there, is DON'T, that is why they moved to a much smaller location, their Business is way off because they continue to do business like the above. Birds should be Matched to a buyer not just shoved down your throat and not care. All Birdsmart want to do is get money anyway they can, because they will be closing their doors within a year, so no one has Any recourse as they are displaying now, SO BEWARE BIRDSMART HAS TURNED INTO CROOKES AND DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BIRDS THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SO MANY RESCUES... SHAME ON THEM!! ..😓😓.ALSO THEY MAY BE GOOD WITH SMALL BIRDS, JUST NOT BIG BIRDS LIKE MACAWS AND COCKATOOS.<//text><rate>1< /rate><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>117852486721441471891<//UserId.>< Name>

Staff was friendly  went to get my birds wings clipped. Been a month and the bird is at full flight already which doesnt happen unless i dont get them cut after months?? Question is how much of the wing did they cut cause it was done within a minute.  Not gonna pay 20 bucks for wings every month.  I should be going every 10 weeks or so and now i gotta pay again to get them clipped.<//Review>

When I went back and asked them about it they just said they were cheap cages from China. I don't know why they would say something like that, basically tough luck. I will never shop here again.</text></record>

< Review>
They offered an array of bird cages and accessories, along with a large assortment of birds. However, some of the birds were too exotic and the conditions were very cramped.</Review>

the food tasted great. My jewish friend even got a free shower and a gold star! The manager had a cool mustache and had a really cool book on his political beliefs. he also has some pretty cool paintings. The freezer room kinda smelled. My only complaint is that the manager was a little angry.</text>

We germans like this Building because of the Grundriss that looks like a Hakenkreuz. In the year 2030 we will visit this traditional building and eat a tasty Kalbschnitzel and drink very good Bier aus Bayern.</text>

Giving theee stars cause it’s usually good people working here, but I just got off a twelve hour work day and the last thing I wanna deal with is someone talking into their earpiece while making my order making me repeat myself multiple times. Then he puts my sandwich down fully wrapped I’m ready to pay and he says just one second.</text>

<text>Food was ok and staff was friendly however due to being slow on Sundays was informed that they do not offer all menu items. Nor do the offer the selection of teas and juices. Not cool when you go to Subway you should be able to have the full menu. They lost three stars one for place being dirty , one for not having tea or lemonade, and one for not having all food items .< /text><Rate>2< /Rate><response>None< /response>< time>

Staff is not very friendly when you're ordering and paying. Frowns all around. Everyone hates customer service but at least try to find the sunshine in what you do. I never have a problem with subway but my sandwich was very skimpy and being in there was depressing on a sunny day. Go to which wich or Panera bread or anywhere else along the strip. I warned you. 6/9/2019<//text>

<Gmap_id>0x80deaccc24feeb9d:0x4e62d9872606357f</Gmap_id><text>Aight. Let me tell yall a story real quick. I went to NYC a year ago and I went to a Subway for dinner. The man yelled at me because I didn't want peppers. I would rather go to that one than go back to the Coronado excuse of a Subway. They forgot to cut my footlong in half. HOW DO YOU DO THAT??? It took a whole 15 minutes to finish my sandwich, which was cold by the time I ate it, about 5 minutes after I walked out. The lady serving me didn't know what I was talking about when I asked for something I could see right in front of me and they put enough spinach to supply a whole colony of starving children, like who tf needs so much spinach. Overall, highly disappointed.< /text><UserId.>116684991985983836386< /UserId.><response>None< /response><name>Jack Cornock< /name><time>1532924008481< /time>< Pics>

The customer service there is horrible, the older employees are even rude to the young employees in front of the customer. If this wasn't the only subway on base I'd never go there agian.</Review>

<review>Absolutely horrible customer service!!  The girls working there are rude, unprofessional, and have no business working in a customer based industry..
Not only could they not follow directions on what to put on the sandwiches, they picked off the items they put on the wrong sandwich then slapped them on the one it was suppose to go on AND laughed about it!!! I will never go back< /review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

(Translated by Google) Perfect place! The food is just fire! Everyone was very welcoming and the manager had a really cool mustache! When I brought my grandfather with me, he wept with happiness. Many Thanks! And you have a very interesting architectural style. Wehrmacht, if I'm not mistaken?

<Text>Lines are always long here I'm the 17th person in line with 4 other people behind me all the way to the door. And only 3 tellers serving people. Honestly we all know this is pointless to post cuz BOFA it's too big to care. Only thing keeping me here is the hassle of changing to another bank. But I'm honestly getting tired of this b.s.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Slowest bank ever.  Only 2 tellers all the time!!  Expect to spend an hour in line !  This is our company's bank and i have no choice but to wait in line every day.   I would NEVER bank here personally!!  Manager doesn't even care.  She just wanders around.  Take your business to a bank who cares.  Austin is a great teller though!  Always super helpful and friendly.<//text></record>

This branch is a joke. Teller and manager did not accept deposit because it was missing the title in front of the name. (Example: Sr. John Smith) the check only had John Smith. Ridiculous! Terrible customer service.< /review>

Awful. This particular "Supervisor" tells me l can not deposit or cash my bofa check because l have a business account & that l would have to wait 3-5 business days to cash a check (same employer for 2 years whom of which also banks with bofa). Then l tried the A.T.M twice now & unable to deposit my cash? Bank needs to be fixed. I now drive 20min. Further just to avoid the nonsense.<//Text>

I understand maybe you guys dont want to hire more ppl. But atleast enforce good customer service you walk out this bank with a horrible experience makes me wamt to cancel my account.

Worst bank in the Antelope Valley! Expect 30 to forty minute wait to see one of there 3 tellers. Also, don't expect a professional teller. Furthermore, hope that your car wasn't hit in there parking lot by someone in a hurry to withdraw there government aid deposit. There waa two fender benders as i was leaving. Third world bank for sure. I'm glad I don't bank at BOA!<//text>

The customer service is a nightmare and they never have more than 1-2 tellers out of 10 windows. Their are more employees walking around than working. I have never seen a manager open up a window to help out. They deserve a zero</Review>

I am only here because I need cash for my business yet they stopped having a separate business banking line. Instead, I'm wasting my day standing in line behind people who could use the ATM to deposit their check or get their balance. How about a line for people who have no choice but to use the cashier service? OR, here's a crazy idea... HAVE MORE TELLERS!!!

Bank charges $8 for a $25 check despite policy published stating they only charge for checks over $50.  Criminal banks are criminals, beware.</Review>

I walk in and it was packed! I used the business line (client has business account) they gave me a hard time , told me I shouldn't be at that window. Not once have I been asked or questioned about being in the business line at the other B of A's . I would suggest the tellers be given another lesson in customer service .Probably the worst bank experience. If I didn't need to be there I would not have stopped by. Next time I'll stop by the 40th west B of A - totally worth the extra 10 minute drive.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c25adb6156a50f:0xcca97f7d74731bf0</gmapID></record>

<text>Camped there, all the spots need grading, not terrible but the weather has worked the slopes down, they've all taken on a slight slope.  Sites 23 and 24 have the best access to water though 22 and 25 also are quite good.  The hosts as always are good people, met them also.  Toilets were very clean.  We did have one group there which was way too loud into the night, drunk, with a loud generator.  Camp host took care of that.

It's a great place for boating, and camping.  But does need some attention to some details.<//text>< pics>

Beautiful and spacious campsites! Hosts were wonderful, no-since people that were very helpful and accommodating. We were informed there were bears but we did not see any. The chipmunks on the other hand will rob you blind! If you walk away from your campsite and stay still for a couple min they will come and see what you have left out for them. The deer were very tame and came within about 20’ of us.</text>

If you book ahead and are willing to ignore the family music/noise/dogs, this is a great campground with a boat launch. It is pretty quiet mid-week, it is crazy on the weekend.< /review>

The campground is nice but although the ramps are open, the dock is not in the water. And there are submerged rocks along the boat ramp which we hit and bent out prop. We had to take the boat out of the water.
We were told that we could not leave the boat and trailer in the parking lot at the boat launch, and that we had to park in the overflow parking for our campground. The problem is that they chopped down a bunch of trees and all the wood is piled up in the overflow so you can't park a boat there.
We decided to park behind a few other boats along a dirt road next to the overflow. There were no signs saying No Parking, and there were at least 3 other boats and vehicles parked on the same road.
We were there for the whole weekend with friends who also had a boat and when we got off the water that evening, we found a parking ticket for $280 on our boat!! There was nowhere else to park because the campground had taken the overflow to store wood. We were not blocking any road, they just want the revenue and assume we'll just pay the ticket.
If possible I will NEVER return to this campground.</Text>

Camped here since 1996, it was on a whim we found this lake back then. Spent many a summers here with my family and close friends.  The memories we made over the years we will cherish a few lifetimes over. Did a lot of swimming, boating and fishing over the years with my children and now its time to take the grandchildren out to frenchmans to relive our fond memories of Frenchmans. Back then my husband commuted to work from here just so the kiddo's and I could enjoy the outdoors. Hopefully we will make some new memories with the grand babies. Happy Camping everyone remember you pack it in please pack it out.< /Text>

<text>Love this place. Fish there as much as possible. Campground very up and down physically. Convenient boat ramp. Many trees marked for clearing should make it warmer. Some spots difficult to use with travel trailer but overall good. I am going to Big Cove to try it, just down the road and more amenities, due to difficulty in walking.< /text>< pics>

Great spot however, the camp host was a bit over bearing. Yes we had 1-2, too many cars but,  our friends were coming & going through out the day, in the middle of the week. We never blocked the road, nor did we ever  block or take over another site.  It seemed like he was on a power struggle.<//Text>

Nice campground. Busy in the summer but there's plenty of room for Rvs and tents. Tame deer and there were a couple of bears that came through at about 2am. Just keep your campsite clean and they'll pass on by. Yeah I got a deer selfie...< /review>

Well kept camp grounds. (Doc) the camp grounds host is a friendly guy who lives there during the busy season is helpful and good source for local info. Stunning mountain setting and thanks to noise regulations in the grounds it's quiet at night. Star filled sky's and great fishing. My only complaint is, if you cook outdoors the yellow jackets are after your food. And they don't give up. Otherwise great place.<//review>

Always tranquil and uncrowded on a Saturday morning during summer. When school is insession? Have sampled a number of the milk teas with boba and all have been good. The rose is, in my opinion, the best. Staff is courteous and helpful.<//Review>

Excellent teas and milk teas. Great selection of boba and extras. Food is decent but a bit pricey for the selection. I would recommend going here for a boba tea drink and smoothies. Popcorn chicken is tasty as well.< /Text>

<review>Dirty environment. Last time I visited I couldn't help but be put off by the collection of filth under the equipment behind the register. While I witnessed employees doing there best to clean up spills they neglected to clean under the large metal equipment. I doubt their efforts could remove what looks like years of neglect. They'd probably have to replace the flooring to even remotely clean this area. Additionally the equipment the employees used looked filthy itself, concerning me over the true quality of cleanliness that their efforts could achieve in the areas they can reach to clean.

The place is always packed which surprises me as the quality of milk tea is lacking. I hear the chicken is good, but from what I've seen the product is nothing like what is advertised on the menu.

The boba itself is hit or miss, somedays it's perfect and others it's burnt. I'm not sure what they use in brewing the tea but I've become ill multiple times after consuming the product, once throwing up before I was able to leave the store having to run outside quickly to avoid causing another mess for the staff to clean.

My experience with the staff has been alright. They're often friendly. My order is usually what I place, except for one time in which a male staff member incorrectly prepared my order which I didn't notice till after I had already left.

With plenty of places in IV that have Boba I would absolutely recommend going elsewhere. The service is the only quality component at Wake Cup. Cleanliness and product are low quality, and advertisement on the menu is completely inaccurate.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>116390138423075843453< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>Seems very hard to find good boba around here in Santa Barbara. Sadly, I felt the same way about Wake Cup. The drinks were pricy for the quality you're getting. Drinks were absolutely terrible. They use powdered flavoring and the boba itself doesn't cut it. Better luck finding decent bubble tea down south.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) If you say you close at 11 o’clock in the evening, don’t close the door in advance, okay finalweek ran over to find you closed at night. Do you think I am in a good mood? The milk tea tasted differently every time I drank the milk tea. Really speechless

(Original)
说晚上十一点关门就不要提前关门好吗 finalweek大晚上跑过去发现你关门了你觉得我心情好吗 每次喝到的奶茶味道都不太一样 有一次珍珠全部坨在一起 根本吸不起来 我真的无语了<//Review>

I love Diamond Nails. Kim always does a fabulous job on my nails. I've never been unhappy with her work and I've been going there for years. I would definitely recommend her for anyone looking for a nail shop. I will for sure be going to her for a long time.<//Review>

Kim always takes care of me! Not one time have I had an issue. Except when I made the mistake of going somewhere else; haha
I’ve been going to Kim for awhile now 3-4years maybe more... I have never had a nail come off or come loose. I’m rough with my nails; so I let her know. Communication is important, tell her what you want or like & she does it & Amazingly too! A lot of times I tell her color & what I want and let her do the rest. Kim is awesome, always kind, caring & thoughtful. Everyone is!  Thank you Kim & staff you all are Amazing!!!      🦋 Jen 🦋</text>

<review>💕Kim did my full set, quickly and beautifully, the matte color is simple yet elegant 😍 She was so friendly and respectful just loved everything about her. It was mine and my daughter's first time there. We both got pedicures👣 too, sweet lady I didn't get her name was so polite and gentle. I love the service/vibe they give you here. I will be back again, and again💅🧖‍♀️< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I have been going to Diamond Nails for over 6 years.  Kim is quick but picky and I have rarely had a nail break or lift.  If it does she will fix it for no charge.  They have tons of color choices.  Also their pedicures last and are priced very well.  I love going to see Kim and can't wait, literally can't wait until they can open again after all of this Covid stuff is over.  They are extremely clean and always wear masks and disinfect everything.< /Review>

The shop is clean, customer service is wonderful and my nails have never looked more natural and fabulous! They don't rush through your manicure, honor appointments plus seat you together and give you plenty of time to dry before paying and showing them off to the world. LOVE this place!</review>< Pics>

I have been going to see Kim and her team for about a year now. She is pretty quick and does a great job. As with all nail salons i have had a couple issues of nails chipping or coming loose but she always fixes them without issue. I typically come in with my own design ideas and she does she best to match colors and designs< /Text>

<Text>I came here after a terrible experience with VIP Nails. My nails were in bad shape to the point it was difficult performing daily routines: writing, typing and most importantly obtaining objects in my hand. They were able to not only correct the damage that was done (acrylic was applied to the nail bed with a heavy hand which was why I was having the issues), plus change the color and the customer service was astounding and efficient. I rarely get a chance to leave a review....but they deserve it. 😊👍👏</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Also they gave out a really cute Xmas card and gift! Such nice people!

ONE YEAR AGO:
I have gotten my acrylic nails done here a few times and she is GOOD and FAST!! Never crowded when I go and she is really nice. The shop is under new ownership and is trying to break free of the last owners bad reputation. My nails lasted 3 weeks in between fills and looked great! They are really reasonably priced also!! $25 dollars and I got glitter powder on the tips and the clear gel coat also! Good deal!

12/09/15 went back here a couple months ago and tried it again, I DID NOT have a good experience the 2nd time! Quality of the work went majorly down hill and my nails lasted 4 days before lifting and cracking ON A NEW SET!! That was that, wont go back!</Review>

<gmapID>0x809adf0347cfcdb7:0xd920ce82db9399cb< /gmapID><text>This salon is owned by Kim and her husband. The first time I went here her prices were decent, $28 for an acrylic full set with basic nail polish. The second time was ok 35 for basic nail polish with two little diamond studs and a fill. Then by the third time going to this salon she started charging me $40 and up. She also couldn't do most of what I was asking, designs, dipping in glitter, and some other updated techniques. She tries to free hand her designs but she's horrible at it. She charges so much for 3D art. They also talk about you in their native tongue right in front of you. I thought this was going to be a salon that I could keep going to but I was totally wrong. I will never go here again. I went yesterday with my sister, not only did the paint job look sooo bad, she charged us $85 for both of our basic nails. So disappointed. Gotta go somewhere else to get it corrected.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I would give -5 stars but that doesn't exist. So I had my nails done in the infamous "20min or less" let's just say I'm here 2 days later and my middle tips are popping off... I only went here because my nail lady was booked. I paid agonist $50 for a full set of acrylic, yes acrylic and I trusted the lady because she was a good sales person, I guess.

<text>My wife went there Monday January 9th after work to get a gel manicure on her real nails and the husband screwed up her nails and charged her 35 dollars for a horrible nail job. He ground down her real nail causing pain because he was more focused on the time. Her pinky nail on one hand is super narrow in comparison to the other, and he took off her previous gel polish by peeling it with cause her to loosed thickness on her real nails! Horrible job I would recommend coming her only to let the dad paint and wife do them. Do not let the husband touch you!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Went there to get my nails filled and was told that my natural nails were ugly and that tips make my nails look better. Wouldn't recommend going there. Very disrespectful< /review>

<Review>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. The worst nail salon I have ever been to. Their customer service was horrible, the lady was rude and was very careless, just trying to get me out of there so she can take the next customer. I came in for a gel color change and I had powder underneath, she did not soak my nails off or file them, she literally ripped them off! It was painful and ruined my nailbed. She also did a gel color change, it was on my cuticles and when i asked her to fix it she said she can’t because thats the way my nails are. My “manicure” looked very messy. And ofcourse they overcharged me, when i came in they told me that a gel color change was $17 and in the end I ended up paying $28 for just a gel color change (thats with no cuticles pushing back). The gel chipped and cracked the next day..usually the gel stays on my nails for 2 weeks.</Review>< pictures>

He serves with class & he is  fun.
Loquacious, well rounded & informed youngman.
The food is excellent. The not making 5 stars has to do with not accommodating the dish. I do not eat bacon. They do not accommodate changes. Otherwise good cuisine, good ambiance and prompt service.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWSdahocYJxWjdUlXCli2YuAT7xM-iE_aiiZcm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkv3jzdM2FYaPnxwmxQsVE2RkaTDTo_OD_JHMh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfSo562k7VQK_eWHC6iWtKUyXvqSWfWjTyOWM6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh4LZfkQ-Ctb-HllV4333Y1J9tMoWKxorrMfYB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd-jcXjfMNgP--AwVw7H1mkO_XJ_C5bRX60BTj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTswAT__nrctjjrNCvvdD4ZZ_Jk28ApbCredrZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfalJs846PV5D6x-vu29rNbk3hUzQqdcmIGGwY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrpzgmeOYIu4n1Ddq0qTTA_0MuJ8U4kzAekOpO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ3Z2GaV-2Qr8HxRp-koeKdYJojEjIhW1KSeK_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnq1PQwDRYnoZdkMefo0LUmBNsoQFMJ8yUhCWc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP0NJWTJ1hLdTKRC30c_SvT5Blu8mKq0qyDdJI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZX4hCleeLj3gzmBc9fbuhI4FJli8dfYbDhnqU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8EZ0gHp_k-l7PhgXWWn_vn8LEwSPr34rOAVKv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRL5W11SyxHdqiSjoiEhg4YgUYK7JISRP8Kaqe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOgnX-VKeVUHe-w4iGx3MPToq3G_5LFBNgKvbg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA6on-Bv5P6I3gXlsYGnA4ChcFCGoD_KBdMb-k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<Review>All in all long story short....rude...slow...food is a joke for the steep price. Never ever yell at a customer in front of a room full of other customers...and do not ignore them when they request to pay for their drink and leave because of embarrasement and a long 45 min wait time.

My boyfriend and I visited here and we both had a great experience. The restaurant was romantic and the atmosphere was very relaxing. It wasn’t very busy at all so it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. We had the artichoke heart appetizer which was so full of flavor I had to stop myself from licking the plate clean. I ordered the Filet Mignon with mushroom sauce and spinach pie and it was very rich and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and he says it’s the best ravioli he has ever had. We both ordered red wine and both were delicious. The waitress Diane was very personable and gracious and it seemed like we had known her forever. The whole place felt very warm and welcoming and it was one of the best experiences we have had at a restaurant. The only complaint I have at all is that the espresso creme brûlée, though the custard was delicious the top wasn’t toasted which was a little disappointing, but it was still amazing regardless. I definitely recommend this place for a nice romantic dinner out.< /text>

<Time>1620011617429< /Time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>113691001252995034499</user><review>This was the worst encounter with eating out a restaurant I think I’ve ever had. To premise this, I am hypoallergenic. I am allergic to eggs and wheat which makes finding places to eat very difficult for me.

I came to visit Cambria for my birthday this weekend. I looked at the menu of this place the evening before I went and it sounded lovely so I made arrangements to get brunch there the next morning. I should’ve read the reviews before I came.

When I arrived with my party we were seated and everything like normal, but it did take some time. The host was very kind and I let him know of my allergies when I arrived. I was not aware of the policy of not changing the food on the menu. I was fine with this but would’ve assumed like any normal person that they could accommodate for my food allergies. BOY WAS I WRONG.

I went to get the gluten free/vegan croissant but the kitchen didn’t have any, which was annoying but I didn’t mind. I then asked about changing some of the other items on the menu so that I would be able to eat without the worry of cross contamination. The waiter kindly told me that “Giovanni” in the kitchen doesn’t alter anything even if it’s due to food allergies. I was deeply upset by this as now I would not be able to eat anything while the rest of my party had their food. Mind you it’s my birthday trip. I ask if I can do the hash browns and bacon and just without the eggs on the side. The waiter says he’ll see what he can do, but said Giovanni was “stubborn.” I was very nervous about cross contamination at this point.

When my food arrived there’s a big plate full of eggs sitting in front of me, but it was just scooted off to one side a little, with absolutely no intent of avoiding cross contamination. I asked if the eggs had touched any of the bacon or has browns and the waiter said no. He was very wrong.

After I had taken a few bites of each I noticed that there was egg residue on both the has browns and the bacon. I started to panic. My allergic are not something that can just be brushed off for your own personal beliefs, especially if you’re running an establishment that feeds the general public. The chef had blatantly ignored the request for my food allergies and handed me a dish that poisoned me. I have been sick and vomiting all day because of the complete disrespect and unawareness of the man behind the cooking.

I had to spend my entire drive hime from my birthday trip vomiting off an on, stopping in the middle of the freeway multiple times to puke my brains out all because of the incompetence of Mr. Giovanni. The waiter seemed to be doing the best he could but it was no no avail. He was having lots of trouble communicating with Giovanni about food and having our orders on separate bills, which is literally a must if you’re owning a restaurant. We were waiting incredibly long waits while the poor waiter seemed to be dealing with a very temperamental and incredibly unhelpful boss. The automatic 20% tip was ridiculous for the service, waits, average at best food, and complete disrespect and borderline discrimination of me and my food allergies. They are simply NOT something I can control so I have to make the best of situations. This made me feel horrible about myself and embarrassed me in front of all of the people I care about. I will tell every human being that is going to Cambria to NEVER go to this establishment after this horrific experience. I feel terribly for that poor waiter and what he has to deal with on a daily basis. And if Giovanni ever reads this, you are a terrible man who caused me immense suffering on a trip that was supposed to be a celebration. I am appalled and deeply saddened. And to all reading this, if you get one thing out of this post, DO NOT EAT HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF FOOD ALLERGY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EAT!< /review>< response>

I read the reviews prior to going here, and the bad ones seem punitive for some reason that I could not discern.  I'm giving this place five stars because the Owners are troopers -- open for indoor dining currently -- and also because the food is quite tasty, and adequately proportioned, leaving room for dessert and coffee.  I had the eggplant burger, and I wanted to eat two of them, it was so delicious, but I was with a bunch of people and that would have been socially unacceptable.  I will be back!  There were lots of options for non-vegetarians, too.  It is the kind of place that you go to EAT in the afternoon.  Sit down and enjoy it.  You can eat a bunch of different, delightful things.  We had a party of 4, with the scrumptious artichoke heart appetizer, three entrees, and a bottle of fine wine, and the tab was $107.00.  I was impressed, and that is no easy feat.</Text>

Just a great experience. Super friendly staff. I ordered the fettuccine Bolognese. Very fresh ingredients homemade pasta and sauce. The owner and chef even came out to check on me. Will definitely be back. Be sure to try their homemade gelato.</Review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>I will never return.

After a really long day, all I wanted was a cup of coffee. Strangely, it seems like everywhere that serves coffee (except for the admirable Harmony Cafe) closes briefly before dinner. Well, after my experience at Harmony Cafe, it's evident that I should have foregone the coffee all together.

There was just one table dining already. The hostess was chatting with them when we arrived, and kindly removed herself from their conversation to greet us. She asked if we had a reservation; we didn't. She seated us, then returned shortly to take our order. Two cappuccinos.

Just a moment to comment on the cappuccinos themselves: I have had many cappuccinos from a great deal of places, and while these weren't bad and the price was average (~$5), I would say Starbucks—surprisingly—does theirs better. No, really.

The hostess immediately asked if we planned to order more, and if not, then could we move to another table. Strange thing to ask an already seated patron in a nearly empty restaurant. Not only that, but she moved us into the furthest corner of the dining area to a table lacking a tablecloth—okay, I guess—but with the added joy of a wobble to the legs.

Not a single party arrived afterward. No one.
Sometimes, I wonder if anyone arrived for the rest of the evening.
For their sake, I hope they dined elsewhere.

I have never felt so un-welcomed. The only disappointment greater than the customer service at Harmony Cafe is the disappointment I have for myself for not speaking up to the Hostess.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><user>111145999662976762686< /user><time>1590535141624< /time><rate>1< /rate><gmap_id>0x80ed25ae1a7cdeff:0x5fc746d778131270<//gmap_id><name>Ardyss Hawley< /name></record>

<date>1529729885407<//date><rate>1</rate><Text>I should have read some of the reviews before going here. I was out with my family for dinner visiting from Santa Barbara and Stockton. The menu sounded good and it was a very cute place. When we walked in there wasn’t a sign about seating or anyone at the door so we assumed we could sit down. The server glared at us when she saw us sitting and came to give us the menu, we apologized for taking a table as there was no one at the door. Very rudely she said she was alone and couldn’t be at all places at once. She forgot to bring my sister her water. When my daughter asked to leave out some condiments from her burger the server told her she couldn’t leave anything off and would have to take it off herself. She also asked for a Hansen’s cola which is on the menu, and the server said she didn’t have them and in a condescending tone said she couldn’t find them to buy and asked me if I knew  where to buy them. Our food took longer than 40 minutes. I understand it was 6 of us but I’ve been other places with a larger group and had much faster not to mention better service. Besides, there weren’t any new tables when we walked in so it shouldn’t have taken so long. When our food finally came out my nephew’s fish (fish & chips plate) was burnt, my niece and I both had the chicken pesto sandwich, our fries were so cold the oil on mine was thick on the fries. I told her my fries were cold, all she did was repeat the same thing and said ok but she never asked if I wanted them replaced (although she should have just replaced them without asking). Not once did she ask us if we were ok or how our food was. When I went to pay I told her I didn’t appreciate her dismissing my comment about the fries and that I wasn’t happy with my food. She argued with me about it and said the cook thought they were fresh so she couldn’t do anything about it. Once I paid, my sister talked to her about the service, the server was rude and told my sister the cook was temperamental and she wasn’t going to argue with him. The server continued to be rude and said she had already apologized then just walked away from my sister. I’ll never go there again and I don’t recommend this place. I did notice she was attentive to tables drinking wine and those whom she conversed with as though they have been there before.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>The ambiance of the garden was very alluring paired with the gentle notes of the piano. An intriguing menu had us convinced that this was the lovely location for our meal this delightful evening. We stood silently at the entrance awaiting our greeting. After multiple minutes we were approached with a less than friendly hostess. We seated ourselves after she insisted I did not grab a menu.

Our first order was for our drinks, as usual. In this event she told my grown sister she was a good girl for having her identification ready because she looked twelve. The condescending comments did not stop there. In fact, every time she spoke to us another rude remark left her lips.

I ordered the the Wild Arugula Salad. My sister, who is a vegetarian, requested the same minus bacon. She was refused. "It is crucial for the flavor." However, when I received mine there was half a crumb of bacon present. It was less than impressive, especially after the huge stink of no special accommodations. On top of that, the smoked salmon was NOT smoked. It was low grade and overly fishy. We politely asked for a to-go box, and she responded once again in her less than pleasant nature. I chose not to further entertain her hatred of life, and instead lightened the mood with a little sarcasm.

We paid promptly and left. Avoid this establishment. Save your precious moments for somewhere worthy.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>This place has a lot of old world charm but the food wasn't that good (especially the buttermilk salad dressing). Salad is an overstatement by the way, it's only just mixed greens and this awful dressing.

Vegans and picky eaters beware. I ordered the eggplant burger and requested no goat cheese. I was told the chef doesn't make changes to any of the menu items so I would just have to remove it. The portion of eggplant was tiny, just as much goat cheese as eggplant (it's not a large or thick slice of eggplant, it was chopped up little bits) and unfortunately I had to remove much of the caramelized onions and tomato because the goat cheese was all over it. It was mostly bread. Between this and not eating the "salad" I left hungry.</text>< userid>

I am a vegetarian and this place has struck a cord with me. This is a gem of a place with every dish we ordered having such delicate and infused flavors, that I would not hesitate saying this is one of the best meals of my life. We got Eggplant burger, Winter Composition plate and Tiramasu and would certainly recommend this place and visit again.<//Review>

If you ask them to leave something off a menu item or change something they refuse and the cook is VERY rude.  I ordered a salad and asked to have the dressing left off and the cook refused and told me to order something else.  The menu is very limited and there was nothing else on the menu I could have.  After I explained it was medically necessary he did leave the dressing off of the salad.  I will never go there again.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Chef refused to give my wife who has celiac disease a bunlessburger. Said she would have to remove it from the bun herself. We decided to just get two bowls of their clam chowder. It was luke warm water with a few rubber band clams and potato chunks throughout. Overall pretty terrible.</Review>

<Review>We were lured in for dinner by the simple but pleasant sounding menu and pianist. We ordered the chicken liver bruschetta as an appetiser to share - it was beautifully presented but let down by a lack of seasoning.

For entrees, I had the fish with fava beans, cherry tomatoes and garlic bread. Again, it was woefully under-seasoned. Once I had added salt, it was a little better but still not great. I also have a suspicion it was microwaved due to the blistering heat of the broth and the way in which The fish had shrunk,  but I may be wrong. The garlic bread was completely lacking in garlic - it was just bread.

My husband had the tagliatelle with sausage and peas, which he enjoyed but conceded that it was very basic and something we would make better at home.

I had my eye on the torta della nonna for dessert as it's one of my favourites  but I didn't bother ordering it as I knew it would just disappoint.

I'm genuinely surprised by the good reviews for this place - my father is Italian and a restaurateur (he is the head chef of his own restaurant) and so I have grown up eating simple but excellent Italian food; the menu here appealed to me for that very reason but it talked a good game and didn't live up to it.

For the standard of food, the menu is incredibly overpriced. We paid $100 (including tip as the waitress was very friendly and attentive) for an entree and two appetisers plus three drinks.

On the plus side, the music was wonderful.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>(Translated by Google) Not recommended at all. I received a $ 14 salad that looks like 5. It didn't even bother to make it cute
Appalling. The waitress was friendly and was the only good thing

(Original)
Para nada recomendable. He recibido una ensalada de 14 dólares que parece de 5. Ni siquiera se tomaron la molestia de hacerlo lindo
Pésimo. La mesera fue amable y fue lo único bueno<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Quick and easy. The prices are a bit higher than a competitor I was going to. The vacuum has great suction that actually got the dog hair out of my carpet and seats. I have experienced no waiting, which is why I switched. I was paying less, but could only access once or twice a month at the other place. I purchased the package that washes the rims, so far I have had to wipe down dirt after washing but I can tell that the rims are much cleaner.<//Text>< Name>

Love washing my car here.... I usually pay for the bogo.... and save my ticket until I have time to go again. Well they expire, now I know. Not only did the manager say, Oh, it expired. I can't do anything about that, would you like to purchase a membership?..... then he crumpled my ticket for a wash I paid for and threw it away.....  worst experience ever. When I asked to speak to someone who could help me with the issue, he said yes I am the manager.... will look somewhere else to wash my car.<//review>

<Review>This is one efficient car wash... And whatever kind of detergents or polishes they use really make your car shine like crazy... I was going to cancel my subscription there because it was a little out of the way for me but when I went to cancel it the dude was so nice to me about it that I decided to keep it. I've tried all the car washes around here and pound per pound this is definitely the best car wash.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been coming here for a while and service is good. Decent prices. You can also buy the price for one car wash and get a second car wash half off. I get the $12 and second one for $6 I do this since I wash my car every so often since it doesn't get super dirty. It works for me but there are other services you can do. Overall good place, haven't had any issues.< /Review>< name>

I went in for an interior/exterior detail and asked for Evil, he was very kind & professional and my car came out spotless and looked brand new! I’m going to be purchasing their monthly membership since they’re so close to me, and I loved the fact that their car wash doesn’t use rubber or plastic cleaners that can damage the paint. Instead they’re soft cloth fabric so I felt safe putting my new black car through their machine. Thank you guys!! ☺️< /text>< UserId.>

<review>Gets the car clean and the vacuums actually have strong suction to get even the most stubborn dog hair off the seats. The air fresheners although I know they are free and I'm grateful . It's a nice touch and they smell great but that really great scent only lasts a day unfortunately.  The only reason I mention it is because I actually really do like the scent. It makes the whole car smell so nice but like I said only for a day . It is a silly thing to say and I'm not really complaining. I just like the scent and I would pay if it lasted longer .</review><UserId.>105988881011325688327<//UserId.>< pics>

This place has an amazing service, the quality of their machines are great. I washed my car a couple of time with them and my car has always sparkled right after the cleaning I would recommend anyone to visit them trust me this will be your regular washing spot there is no going anywhere after trying them once.</review>

Not the best car wash  it scratched deep on my car, the manager doesn't want to accept that its happen true on their car wash. I show it him just after my car came out, and still in the drying area. also I have some light scratched on one side of the car from front to the end approx. 2 ft. interval. Employees are rude.< /text>

Car wash was great but not enough stalls for vacuuming and detailing car. Was going to buy the membership anyways because it's close to my home but chose not to after a worker rudely asked if I was finished and pointed at the ten minutes sign. No way am I going to pay for a membership and be rushed especially since my car is black. The worker just said "ok that's fine " terrible costumer service!< /review>

Everything is new. My car is super clean. No streaks on the glass or wash spots. Very happy with the results. The place is easy to spot from the main road. There is also a vacuum area attached to it. 5 stars.< /Text>< pictures>

They provide towels to clean in and outside of your car. Was here almost an hour and they left me to clean my car. Other places give you max 10 minutes. Totally recommend this place staff is nice and professional too.<//Review>

Beware! They set you up for auto pay when you pay for a monthly pass without your knowledge or consent. I just realized I've had them deduct 25 bucks out of my account twice haven't been there in 3 or so months because the water ripped my wiper blades. Try to call them and telephone rings continuously. Now I have to contact my bank for refund and stop payment. You've been warned!<//text>

Great idea to get pulled through the carwash and then be able to pull in to a slot so you can vacuum the car and wipe it down. They have monthly plans available if you like to get your car washed more than once a month. Nice people working there< /Review>

I've been to plenty of car washes before that they have the same system but I've ever been satisfied as this time. My car is brightening before I even start dry it with towels. Paulie is one of success' keys in this car wash because of his great service and attitude. I got my annual subscription for $100 so I can wash my car anytime for whole the year 😊. Get yours before they increase the price as this service has a very high demand.

The system is new and it's really powerful specially in removing all the mud on the car and the tires. Everyone has a spot to park the car and start using the vacuum and towels after that great car bath.

I rate it 6 out 5 ⭐s and highly recommend it!</Review>

The only reason why it is a FOUR STAR review is because the air fresheners they give are not good at all. I literally have like 3 in my car and I can not smell anything. They need to talk to SOAPY JOES because their air freshener smell BOMB! But they are still a good place for me and I just hope they upgrade the AIR FRESHENERS because that’s one important thing when it comes to car care.< /review></record>

<Review>TERRIBLE experience!! Who the hell charges monthly membership for a car wash?!! This is El Cajon! Not Beverly Hills! As soon as the smart mouthed attendant started giving me attitude, I said hell no. That’s not how you treat customers, especially potential customers! Plenty of good choices out there<//Review>< pics>

Always leaves my car spotless with the basic wash but if you have a messy car make sure to clean it out before hand Because you only get 10min in the vaccume stall if they aren't too busy they let you stay longer but during peak hrs they really keep track of time</review>

I usually will only ise the vaccumes once a month but i like that i can just quicky drive in and drive out and if my cars a little dirtier that week ill just loop around and go back in 1 more time.  I do wish they had better air freshners when they ran out of the personalized ones they had the little square ones those smelled really good. Wish they would bring those back or have otehr options. Id even pay for different air freshners if they had them.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Twice it's happened where I finished my wash and along comes the trash truck completely covering my black car with a fine dust after dumping the dumpster. Brought it up to the manager and he said to run it through again.  I don't have time. Basically they are too lazy to schedule pick up before opening. Very poor customer relations.  So I canceled my membership and will do business down the street as will my friends. Waste Managment driver said he could care less. Dave B.<//Review>< gmapID>

It’s meant to save you time and money considering our washes start at $8 and we offer BoGo everyday! We are sorry if our facility inconvenience you in anyway and welcome you back to try us again anytime!'}</response>

Very clean and friendly environment. I came here to try the laser  because it’s non invasive treatment. I have not felt any pain at all with this procedure, it’s super quick and easy way to target your stubborn hair in a relaxing way. I have seen the results that I’d wish and  I’m barely on my third session. I would recommend this place<//Text>

Amazing staff very friendly and knowledgeable. The office is cute and clean. I got my first Botox treatment here and I’m very pleased with the results. I am a younger patient so they were able to set me up with information on touch ups, results, and side effects. Can’t wait for my next session< /review>

One of the best experiences I have had at a spa in this area. I been to a couple around the area and the service was not good. Smooth Skin Lounge was very professional and really friendly. They made me feel at home even over the phone. It’s amazing what they do here. The vibe is great and the spa is super hip. Love it here.<//Text>

<review>Although the microneedling didn't work for me, I must say that they are very friendly and professional. The manager went out of his way to contact me and offered me a different service free of charge even though I didn't ask for it.  They truly seem to care about thier clients and try their best to make them happy.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2bd029807b1ef:0xd3fd7f8cc93565b5<//GmapID>< Date>

I went in to get a facial, and what a facial it was. my skin has never felt so good after this procedure was done. My face was glowing, so radiant and clear.   The experience was great and relaxing Tyra had this gentle touch and made me feel comfortable.  She had this really dope music playing in the back ground super chill. I highly recommend this place.</text>

<Review>I got the sculptra butt lift. I had phenomenal results. It was the best experience I’ve ever had with a spa. They made me feel comfortable and at ease during the entire process. Everything was clean and beautiful. I’d recommend them to friends or family. 10/10 made an appointment for the kybella neck lift next and I can’t wait.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I’m very pleased with the outcome after 5 sessions of laser hair removal I no longer have the unwanted hair I once had or the razor burn. Ever since I took a liking to swimming and I noticed that most were hairless, I asked a friend what he did and he referred me to smooth skin lounge. I thought it was going to painful and surprisingly it was not bad at all , I will be back for other services. Smooth as can be thank you ladies.< /text>< pictures>

<text>The faculty is super compliant with COVID safeguards, and the staff is courteous, and professional. The doctors are experienced and enjoy what they do and listen to the desires and the patient’s objective(s). Then suggestions are presented to adjust offer options often at less expense and delay. I found it easy to trust, relax and get the result I wanted and on the same day.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I was extremely hesitant about getting Botox and fillers since I didn’t seem to need it. Boy was I wrong! They knew exactly what I needed..quick and painless. The MDs here definitely get the job done right, results are amazing. Will definitely be returning and telling all my friends about Smooth Skin Lounge.

This place was incredibly clean and totally on top of covid-19 protocol! I felt taken care of from the second I stepped in. The staff is attentive and makes you feel like all attention is on you for whatever you need. The kybella neck lift is so great! Delivered just as promised.

<rate>5<//rate><text>I normally dont leave reviews but this place has earned one from me. I found this place on instagram and Smooth skin lounge is a life saver. I have struggled over the years to find the right skin care/products to help me deal with my acne. It never really hit me that maybe i should try a skin spa. I have tried products that a dermatologist even recommended that did not work for me. The doctor that works here is so knowledgable. After my facial they showed me some products that they swear by and so far so good they are providing better results then other products i have tried. LOVE THIS PLACE.< /text>< Pics>

CA Beauty has been my go-to laser center for quite some time now. The staff is professional and helpful.Scheduling is always easy because they are so accommodating. Araz is the nurse I schedule my appointments with. She does a wonderful job and makes you feel so comfortable. I highly recommend this beauty center.</review>

Came to get a consultation & the staff along with the doctor provided excellent service. Everyone was very friendly and polite. They’re knowledge about anything when asked, was exceptional. I get the RF FACIAL & it’s literally hands down, the best thing that has ever happened to me. I truly see a difference every time. I came with my partner, Fernando and they accepted us and treated us with such kindness and respect. We are apart of the LGBT Community and where I come from that says a lot! SSL you got yourselves some loyal customers!<//Review>

At a certain age you start to really notice what a toll life has taken on your body and skin. For me that age is 40 I just hit the big four O and really have been noticing my aging skin. So I started to look into things that’s I could do to make myself feel/look a bit younger and that’s when I found smooth skin. I booked myself an appointment for some Botox treatment and it was the best choice I ever made. My skin looks so much tighter, no deep wrinkles and I feel so much better about myself. Thank you to everyone at smooth skin.</Text>

I cannot say enough good things about this place! The office itself is gorgeous (and very clean!) and the staff were all so welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable. I received under eye filler for the first time and was a bit nervous, but the injector was so calm and answered all my questions. She also explained every step of the process and had a very gentle hand so it didn’t hurt at all! Overall highly recommend!</review>

They temp check, and make sure everyone is following protocol for safe measures against COVID-19. Love this place, they welcomed me with so much comfort. Got my lips done, and treated me with so much carefulness. Lips came out perfect. Wanted a natural plump and couldn't have asked for better service. Thank you.</Text>

I have been reading about Coolsculpting for a while because I wanted something noninvasive and non surgical and decided it would be my best option. I found smooth skin lounge on google and seen all the good five star reviews so I went to them. I couldn’t have made a better decision. There staff is super knowledgeable, they make you feel really comfortable  and there prices are pretty affordable. Can’t wait for my second Session.</text>

As a guy I’ve never had a facial. I was recommended here and was hesitant but after having a few things pointed out to me by some friends I decided to give it a try. I was more than happy with the price after doing some research. And the results were amazing! My skin felt so much better. I would definitely recommend smooth skin lounge to anyone needing this treatment!<//text>

I have been so self conscious about my lips for so long. I have been doing my research on a lot of places on where to get lip augmentation (Fillers) to make myself feel better about myself. I found smooth skin lounge and seen  so many reviews about all the services they provide and decided to go ahead with them. I cannot be more satisfied with my choice. Thank you smooth skin lounge!< /Text>

My husband and myself found this place a few weeks ago and I had my first cool sculpting session. I was very happy with my results so I came back for my second session as recommended. I can officially say that I am in love with cool sculpting. It’s non surgical non evasive and not too expensive either.</Text>

<text>So today I visited Smooth Skin Lounge. Very clean facility and welcoming staff. They’re following all of the proper protocols to ensure everyone’s safety during this pandemic. It was my first time coming here for cool sculpting and they did not disappoint me. Look forward to coming back!</text><user_name>Sidney Terrell<//user_name><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2bd029807b1ef:0xd3fd7f8cc93565b5< /GmapID><pics>None< /pics>< user>

<review>A few years ago I was in a accident that injured my lower bottom lip. Making it look flat on the lower side. Went to smooth skin lounge recommended by a friend to see about their lip filler treatment. At first I was unsure about going through with it, I then ended up going through there process to fix my lips. I can't believe my lips are restored thank you smooth skin.< /review>< Pics>

I came in for a waxing and I rarely get waxed because it makes me feel uncomfortable and the last time I went i swelled up. I decided to give this place a go since I saw good reviews. The staff was super friendly and the service went smoothly. I didn’t swell up at all! They made me feel comfortable and I will definitely be returning! Highly recommended 💪🏼😊< /text>

After floating around to different places to get lip fillers and being highly disappointed, about 2  months ago I was recommended by a friend to visit this place. They listen to what you want and also give you an honest examination and tell you what is needed without going overboard. They are beyond pleasant, polite, and kind to their patients.<//Text>

Sent someone here and they said it was the most professional service they’ve had and that the staff made her feel incredibly comfortable the entire time. 10/10 would recommend to a friend again.</Review>

<date>1597436111871</date><review>A friend of ours referred my boyfriend and I to this place, and at first we were a bit skeptical. I usually like to check the reviews before going to a place, but I have to say it’s the best decision we’ve made. We’ve gotten Botox done before, but we didn’t get that true satisfaction like today! They knew exactly what we were looking for. Our lips look AMAZING!! We will be back for more! LGBT< /review></record>

<review>I highly recommend smooth skin lounge! I needed to get hair removed and looked around for the best place. After talking on the phone with this place, I needed to look no further. They were so nice, respectful, and patient. When I came in for a consultation, it was clear I was working with a competent team who knew my needs, because they took the time to talk to me first and didn’t treat me like a number. They listened to all my concerns, even the little ones that I was embarrassed to ask. They were patient and provided me with all the attention I needed. The procedure its self was easy! No pain, no hassle, and GREAT results. If you want to go to the best, look no further!<//review>< pictures>

First let me start off by saying that this place immediately brought me a very warm & comfortable experience.Everything from the cleanliness of the office to the friendliness & professionalism of the staff was very appreciated & noted. I’ve been going here since the place opened up & have taken advantage of all the services they provide. Extremely reasonable, especially for routine goers such as myself. I highly recommend Christine!</text>

Smooth Skin Lounge really lives up to their name, I’ve been to so many different places to get waxed but I wasn’t satisfied due to miscommunication and poor quality. But at Smooth Skin Lounge they took the time to understand what I wanted and took the time to insure I would get the best quality. The staff is friendly and  they didn’t waist my time!! Highly recommended!< /Text>

Highly recommended. Great customer service, extremely friendly and very knowledgeable on how to get your skin on track. I’ve been suffering from adult acne for 2 years. I’ve bought so many skincare products and even a dermatologist visit to address my skin concerns, but nothing has helped. After one visit here, I’m already seeing results and I feel so much more confident about my skin. Feeling confident and refreshed! Already have my next appointment booked! Again, I highly recommend!< /Text>

Everyone feels like a true professional, taking their time to do things right and ensure I’m satisfied with the results. They are diligent, gentle, and accurate.

Love Smooth Skin Lounge. I was recommended by a girlfriend of mine and so glad I scheduled an appointment. Everyone is so friendly, they are always willing to help you with any questions or concerns you may have. They made me feel at ease before and after my procedure. They are truly the best. I would highly recommend.< /Review>

I had the most amazing time here. The staff welcomed me as soon as I walked into the office. Being a first time client, they walked me through all the paperwork since I had a couple questions. I went in for laser hair removal and when I was brought back for the treatment, the staff member was super friendly and talked to me the whole treatment. She made sure I was comfortable and offered me ways to be more comfortable. I am super excited for my next treatment. I am already seeing some results on the areas that I had the treatment on.< /text>

<Review>What an experience. I originally didn't want to come, by my girl pushed me to come check them out. I came in to address some skin issues. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and modern this spa is. The environment and especially the staff are all top notch.My skin is crazy now (in a great way)! I don't have those little annoying acnes that come out after I shave. She also helped me with the ingrown hairs that come on my face after I shave (i get them even if I use a DE razor or straight razor).
My girl said she also gets a lot of compliments on her skin too our visits from Smooth Skin. My girl highly recommends them for the micro-needling treatments. She's extremely knowledgeable and thorough.
If you have any issues at all, this is the place.
My girl and I have a few friends who do a variety of film and other camera related work, and they've gone here and worked with the nurses at the spa.
I'm not one to go to spas and what not, but I'm glad my girl recommended me to come by.</Review></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Found this gem after looking around for a medi spa that truly understood what I wanted when it came to skin care. There was none of the hoopla or up selling spiel you get with most places. From the moment you walk in the door, you are welcomed with bright smiles and like minded individuals. I was carefully consulted and given many options to tackle my needs! I’ve received so many compliments on how bright and youthful my skin looks. A huge part of that is thanks to smooth skin lounge!</Review>< pictures>

I think this was one of the greatest experience I have had getting a facial. I’ve been to other places and they are just facials. So I work in a office all day and don’t really get much fresh air or get any sunlight. So once a month I like to try and do some self care, a friend mentioned to me that his girlfriend took him to this place called Smooth Skin Lounge and it was amazing how relaxing it was! So I thought I would go and check it out! I called set up an appointment. Brandon was the gentleman who set me up with the appointment , and very friendly I outta say.  The ambience in the room was perfect for a self care day, very zen like! My skin was refreshed and glowing after! I will surly be back along with some coworkers, to experience this relaxation</review>

I go here and I’m local and very pleased with their services. Lastly the parking is so hard to find and if it wasn't for the FREE customer valet parking it would be a nightmare.

Just had my third facial here, and I absolutely couldn’t be happier. My skin is glowing, they were so informative with giving me a plan for how to get my skin to its ideal condition. This place changed my skin in a way I didn't believe possible. I would give 6 starts if I could!!!</review>

<review>I found a gold at the end of the rainbow in smooth skin salon. I made an appointment to get waxing and facial and I received the most amazing professional service. I’ve tried different other skin salons and this is far the best overall service I’ve ever received. I will refer Smooth Skin Lounge to all my friends and colleagues.

I’m not gonna lie I’ve been ugly for the past 3 years. I saw this place had good reviews so I gave it a try. My skin just became so much better believe it or not I ended up finding a beautiful girlfriend and now we have a child on the way. This place has flipped my whole life around. Highly recommend it 😁</text>

Came to get a consultation at this Med spa and the staff along with the doctor provided me and my girl excellent service. They were a very  friendly and polite knowledgeable crew and they made me and my girl feel very comfortable. I was recommended to get the RF Facial by Suzee and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Truly see a difference. I'll use this service for sure in the near future. And recommend it to all!!<//Text>

My experience at Smooth Skin Lounge was excellent. One of my clients referred me to Suzy and she listened to exactly what i wanted. With all the information out there, it was great to talk to a professional, with a consultation tailored to me. As a barber I appreciate individualized services. Highly satisfied with my treatment and will be back.< /text>

Every single person who works here is an absolute sweetheart. I felt so comfortable and in the right hands. They sat down with me and gave some great advice on my options while keeping in mind my budget and the overall look I was going for. They did my treatments and I honestly may never go to anyone else ever again. They talked me through everything and were very gentle and thoughtful throughout the process. I would recommend this spa to absolutely anyone!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I have been receiving laser treatment from Smooth Skin Lounge - and already have seen results from one session. My hair is thinner and not growing as excessively.

Friendly staff, convenient location, and valet parking avail - which has been a true blessing. I look forward to my future laser sessions @ Smooth!!<//Text>

My Cool Sculpting experience has been a great one. I've been having trouble with my mid section for quite some time now. After my daughter was born, I lost most of my weight but tried every exercise and diet to get rid of this stubborn lower belly fat but nothing helped. My last resort was trying Cool Sculpting and I'm so happy I did. I've noticed a big difference in the way my stomach looks. I'm very happy with my results and I'm excited to schedule another appointment for the other areas of my body. Everyone here at Smooth Skin Lounge has been so wonderful. It made my experience that much better.< /Text>

<text>So I have been looking for a place like this to get a facial for quite some time. After finding this place I don’t think I will ever need nor want to go anywhere else. The staff and doctors here are really professional and make you feel really comfortable. Not to mention they provide exceptional services.
I look forward to coming back here again.

I was referred by a friend to get a facial And  it was a real awesome experience my face feels smooth and youthful. I’ve had a facial once before but it did not feel anything like my face feels now. The way my skin is glowing i will definitely refer others to Smooth Skin Lounge and ill will be back. The staff there was very friendly and made me feel completely comfortable.< /Review>

<Review>Went into Smooth Skin Lounge a couple days back after doing some research on some places in the area. As they seemed to be my most viable option. Went in for a facial and fillers, everything was very clean and very professional. Definitely a place I would recommend. I thought I looked great before but great has taken on a whole new meaning.

Got lip fillers for the first time ever today and I’m actually really happy with the results. I was always so skeptical about doing it because it looks painful but I finally got the courage to go through with it. My lips are a little swollen and bruised but it’s only temporary. Thank you smooth skin lounge.< /review>

So I had two procedures done at this lovely place which was amazing. I went in and had Botox for the first time, I was super nervous but the staff were so helpful and friendly, the nervousness went away. There was nothing to be nervous about. I also went in to have my bottom bleached which came out amazing. Thank you so much for your help. My face is looking great also. I will definitely refer others to Smooth Skin Lounge, and definitely will be back.<//Text>

The consultation and procedure went very well!

The staff and Doctors are very polite and caring. The medicine and regimens have visible results even only after a day or two of usage.

I have more sessions to go but just the first session i had made alot of differences! I’m so happy! my skin looks radiant and brighter now! I can’t wait to finish the whole session, and will also bring friends along with me next time! 😍<//review>

<Text>I highly recommend this place! I got a facial done here and my skin is now revived, fresh, and soft! My skin was so rough, and there was so much dead skin I was looking almost off color, but after the facial here I got that "glow" every girl wants in there skin. I've gotten so many compliments on how my skin looks so soft and beautiful!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bd029807b1ef:0xd3fd7f8cc93565b5<//Gmap_id></record>

Where do I begin...

I am beyond thankful for Smooth Skin Lounge.

I had such an amazing experience from my first call with Brandon to the moment I left. I had so many questions and he calmly talked me though all my concerns.

He let me know that I’d be able to come in for a free consult with a doctor. I did not expect that was pleasantly surprised. When I arrived at the lounge for my consultation I fell even more in love with Brandon. He was so sweet and introduced me to Suzie who went through my concerns again. She was super helpful and I didn’t feel any pressure. We went over short term and long term goals for my skin and by the end of it I felt so confident my decision.

The whole experience was amazing and I seriously can’t thank these people enough. I thank you for being so professional, caring, and patient with me. I’ll be back and definitely going to spread the word to my friends!

< Review>
Most of us men don't go to Med Spa, but my friend recommended for us to go since I had this pimple that just wouldn't go away and was getting worse. I tried it all but nothing helped. They had it all taken care of in less than 1 hour with an amazing facial which honestly feels like a massage which I literally fell sleep on. Great location and atmosphere, the doctors are really friendly which is a huge plus.</Review>

Smooth Skin! What more can I say? I was walking a couple days ago and stopped in to check it out. They offer so many services, it’s seriously a one stop shop. I decided to schedule a hydrafacial and some laser hair removal. Left the spa feeling incredible. My face is so soft and feels so clear and clean. And got the laser hair removal on my arms. They feel so soft... Staff was amazing, I felt so comfortable in the spa. Definitely stop in, it’s worth it.<//review>

<text>Let me start of by saying thank you to Brandon. He was very helpful in setting up my appointment and answering all of many questions I had. This was my first time scheduling an appointment for a facial and I really had no clue what exactly what it was that I needed. Im in the union working on elevators for a living. Yes I deal with a lot of dust and other things in the air that are not good for the face! I informed Brandon on my issues and he was very helpful in what type of facial was best for me. All staff were amazing and the lounge had a dope chill vibe about it. Smooth Skin Lounge made me feel comfortable and the experience was a memorable one. I will definitely recommend this spot to others and will be back soon. Thanks!< /text>< date>

I stumbled upon Smooth Skin Lounge while visiting my girlfriend and was in need of some Botox, fillers as well as a lash extension fill. I could not be happier with my service providers and the quality of work. Definitely will be back on my next visit.

They also offered me a huge discount on my first hydra facial because they could tell I needed it.  Now I get them regularly, they actually make a huge difference.</review>< pictures>

The team at Smooth Skin changed my life. For years I dealt with problematic skin and could never find a solution.

After a consult at Smooth Skin and the Dr we came up with a game plan and executed it once a month untill I had completely perfect skin.

Thank you guys so much. I will be referring everyone I know with skin issues.< /review>

I treated my wife to Spa did here recently to help her rehumanize after working a string of graveyard shifts at the hospital. She came out rejuvenated, relaxed and light as a feather, and her skin looks beautiful. She said the staff was very kind and knowledgable and made her feel welcomed and comforted. I think she looks 10 years younger.</Review>

I'm a first timer here and the experience was lovely. Easy booking the appointment. Great prices and full explanation about injectables. I'll be back and the girl is the gal to see Natural looking goals. She explained so much about every detail. I felt so relaxed.< /Review>

< Review>
It’s always been difficult for me to find a good skin care facility for my aging skin until I was recommended Smooth Skin Lounge. Both of my daughters get their microdermabrasion treatment so I finally tried it and loved it! I also got Botox on my forehead lines and they are practically gone! I’ll definitely stay a customer for life.</Review>

I’ve recently been suffering from facial skin problems and it has affected my self confidence dramatically. After experimenting with multiple skin care products nothing has worked. Although very hesitant and embarrassed I went to Smooth Skin Lounge. Place was amazing, and welcoming they allowed me to felling extremely comfortable. It had a great ambiance and Staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Would definitely recommend this spot, worth checking out!!!!!<//Review>

This review is long over-due. Ever since I moved to L.A, I have been looking for a  lounge as professional and caring as "Smooth Skin Lounge" Everyone From the moment you walk in, you are made for feel like a queen. I had the facial, which did miracles to my face. My skin feels and looks 10 years younger. I finally found my new local skin lounge.</Review>

I highly recommend smooth skin lounge as there parking in LA is spacious and easy! I know the importance of that! Lol
Saira  is amazing! All staff is helpful and friendly. It is a very safe and clean environment, and all products are reasonably priced. Had two rounds of Botox, a facial with next to no pain as I am a big baby. :) They make you feel relaxed and cared for and I would feel very comfortable in telling all my friends to come and pamper themselves, I give the smooth skin lounge a 5 star rating as I am overjoyed with my results! Thank you for making me feel beautiful.<//Text>

I was nervous to get Botox for the first time but at the age of 60 I really needed it. After trying botox at other places my wife didn't notice any difference but when she started going here she started to look drastically younger and was glowing. Now my wife goes here faithfully it was time for me to look younger. Now I LOOK 20 YEARS YOUNGER. I DO NOT HAVE ANY CROWS FEET AROUND MY EYES. I cant even explain how life changing it is to look and feel so much younger from one procedure. I now book appointments with my wife because this place is the best.< /Text>

I went in to get second laser hair removal about a month ago and I am extremely happy with the results so far. I was very skeptical at first but after the super friendly staff talked me through the process and how long it would take to see results, I am excited to go back and continue my treatments. I would highly recommend Smooth Skin Lounge to all of my family and friends.</Text>

This place is AWESOME - friendly staff, clean & classy environment, and great services being offered. I had a hydra facial and it left my face feeling so good! If you’re in the market for a facial, you should definitely check out Smooth Skin Lounge!</Text>

I don’t leave reviews often, but Smooth Skin Lounge was so good that I had to. From top to bottom my experience was excellent. The customer service was excellent, the ambiance was excellent, and the prices were excellent . I highly recommend Smooth Skin Lounge and I will personally be back very soon.</Review>

How did I not come here sooner?? I’m hooked!
I work full time, do grad school full time, dancing and rehearsing daily where there is pretty much not enough hours in the day and stress levels are at an all time high!. So taking too much time to plan some self care days are scarce but I think that will be changing because of how quick, and easy things were to set up! Brandon helped me set up my appointment which was a breeze. Once I got there, the whole free valet thing they have going on was a really nice cherry on top. Now, I’m very skeptical about anyone touching my face and in regards to my skin, but they were superb, know what they’re doing, and worth every dollar! Can’t wait to be able to go again!</review>

I brought my wife in to get a facial and botox a few days ago. She has been trying to find a trustworthy place for months now so I googled and came in with her. Nicole at the front desk was amazing, made us feel welcome and comforting. Was not too long before my wife was taken back, I went back with her. Let me say, Jen was just amazing doing the botox on her, very gentle and caring! At that point they had my trust and I waiting in the front for my wife, she said the facial was just as amazing! Highly recommend this place!! Thank you for the phenomenal service!</text>

5 stars to Smooth Skin Lounge! I got a much needed facial and was told this was the place to go. Making the appointment was easy over the phone, great customer service, and availability was easy. Finding the place was a breeze and when I was greeted by the front desk I felt welcome. The office was extremely clean and I knew I made the right choice. My wait to be seen by my esthetician was very short. I was sat in her work station, made sure I was comfortable, and asked me all the right questions. She made sure I expressed all of my concerns and needs I wanted for my facial. The facial was like a dream and I saw the results weeks afterwards. I would highly recommend making an appointment asap.<//Text>

My husband and I were in town on vacation and I had a pimple that was giving me serious problems. A friend of ours recommended me here and I was beyond grateful! The facial was amazing and felt like a massage. I literally fell asleep! The pimple was gone and so was the pain. An amazing place and would highly recommend to anyone needing there services!<//Text>

I was blow away by Smooth Skin Lounge. I went in for my first Botox session on my forehead and I was QUITE nervous.  Literally seconds after walking in the office I was at ease. Seeing the establishment, other happy customers, and just talking to the staff, made me feel so confident in my decision. They are professional and extremely knowledgeable all while being very personable to each guest.  It’s been a few days since my Botox and I am beyond pleased. They even called to check in on me!

I will 100% be back. Overall experience 20/10.< /Text>

<review>I am a man oozing with machismo and so when I need a facial I generally grab various grits of sandpaper out of the garage and end with a top coat of boiled linseed oil...but my older sister on the other hand has been going to this place and I've noticed how her skin is young and not man-like.  She easily can be confused for my younger sister now and so I'd say if you do not want your skin to be man-like then this is a great place to go.< /review>< pics>

<Review>So before all this madness, I had the opportunity to visit this beautiful spa. I had an appointment in the books, and was really looking forward to my facial/botox treatment, and the velashape! Brandon was so helpful in explaining all the amazing services they provide here, and was able to give me a discounted price since they are just opening! They offer so many high tech services, with the latest machines and they're run by professionals [doctors, nurses, etc.] Can't wait to start making this my regular place!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bd029807b1ef:0xd3fd7f8cc93565b5<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Bought my husband a gift card for a facial and definitely had to get one myself after I heard how it went. It was just as he described. This place is incredible. I purchased a set of hydrafacials and they gave me a discount!! I can’t wait to go back for my next one.<//Review>< Name>

<Text>I came to Smooth Skin Lounge to get laser IPL treatments with my mom. They always take their time to talk and the helpful staff are so accommodating and friendly. The office is super clean and professional. Both of our IPLs came out great-especially my moms. She had some redness and was not sure if it would help, but after a few days it made a tremendous difference. We had previously been to a couple different places for the same procedure and Smooth Skin Lounge is by far the best work and the best price. We will return soon for another session!!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>I was visiting Studio City with my girlfriend, and we walked into this place to check it out. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They educated us on the different products and treatments that they had available. My girlfriend had Botox and fillers done beautifully. The results were subtle but made a significant difference in how much younger she looks. As someone who works in healthcare, I saw that this place uses the highest grade of cosmetic products. 5 star service, treatment, and results!</text>< rate>

After reading all the good reviews I decided to give this place a try. I‘ve noticed a big improvement on my face after my first hydrafacial treatment, I suffer from sun discoloration and acné but after my first hydrafacial I’ve noticed my skin tone looks more even and my acne has improved.</Text>

I was referred to this amazing salon by friend of mine for Botox service. I was completely satisfied after my first Botox service and I made another appointment to get some waxing done. I will never go to another salon but is smooth skin salon because the overall service and professionalism. I was in good hands and I trusted their ability to take care of me. Thanks again and I will see you soon for more services and I’m referring all my friends.</Review>

Great service. Quick & easy to schedule with great communication from the front desk & the physicians as well! It’s always an in & out visit. Efficiency is super important to me in my busy day-to-day life. Smooth Skin Lounge is reliable, and they’re my go to Skin Aesthetics Spa in LA.<//review>

Came in for Laser Hair Removal. I've never had this done before so I was a little nervous. The office is so warm and inviting and so is the staff. The Dr. did my LHR and it was great! We were talking during to process so it took my mind off of the little discomfort I was having. I noticed results within that same week of the laser. I was so amazed at the results I got with just one visit, looking forward to the next results!If you've ever thought about doing LHR or are just annoyed with constantly having to wax/shave your underarms, I definitely recommend scheduling an appointment.You will NOT be disappointed!<//Text>

<Text>Late post but a must.  I was told by a friend to visit this place a few weeks a go and i am glad i did. Walking into the establishment was very welcoming. Nice staff upon arrival. I went in for a facial due to my oily skin and recent acne issues. I paid for the Acne Facial . They steps they take with cleansing, steaming, exfoliating and face mask was the best i ever had. I have tried OTHER places and they rushed threw the process. I felt like the aesthetician took her time and made me feel relaxed ( think i even snoozed a few times) Highly recomend this place and priced just right.</Text>< Pics>

I got a hydro facial recently at the Smooth Skin Lounge and felt it was one of the best facials that I have ever experienced.  I was recommended the Restore Calm cream and am amazed at how well it has toned down the redness in my skin. I will definitely purchase both again.  Thank you Smooth Skin Lounge!<//Review>

<text>I was a little worried hearing some of the negative reviews, but thankfully my experience wasn't a bad one.
I don't know about botox or anything, so i can't say much on that, But I went to get waxed and the staff was nice and patient with me.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I made my appointment with Smooth Skin Lounge on yelp after seeing their great reviews on google. I don’t live close by but I work in a nearby dental office and figured I can go on my lunch. I got there 5 min early, they were all ready for me ... I am not going to share what I did... lol... but let’s just say it was worth it❤️. From start to end it took 45 mins and I got a few samples of very high-end brands. The girls are cool, the doctors are gentle, and the place is spotless. Everyone keeps on asking where I went lol. Thanks again guys!</Review>< Pics>

I called in the morning, they were able to fit me in by the afternoon! Great customer service, extremely friendly and knowledable. I received a hydro facial to help with my stressed acne prone skin. It was AMAZING. Jackie took great care of me and I’ll be making sure to come back again. She also gives great face/neck/shoulder massages that put me in a great mood to go about the rest of my day! Feeling refreshed!< /Text>

My first time at Smooth Skin Lounge was AMAZING! Making my appointment was very easy and the front desk was very helpful and knowledgeable. The day of my appointment I was greeted as soon as I walked in and was offered coffee and water right away. I had  lip fillers done and although I was very nervous for my first time Angela was very kind to walk me through how the process works and what to expect. She was very kind, gentle, and attentive to her work. I will definitely be returning soon for additional services!< /review>

So with this weather changing from cold to warm my skin get dry and my rosacea starts to act up. I have very sensitive skin so i have to be careful with what goes onto my face. Anything with alcohol or warming products is not good for my skin. My face will become very red and irritated, the last facial i had i went to this place and specifically explained my situation with my sensitive face. I told tbem no products with alcohol please and they still used products with alcohol. So i was kind of stand offish towards going to thos place. A friend referred me to smooth skin lounge so i thought i would give it a shot. Brandon i think his name was, was very understanding in my issues, and directed me to exactly what would be best for me. After my facial my skin felt amazing and no redness popped up. I surely will be back.</text>

I have been to many med spas in the Los Angeles area, even those ridiculous ones touted by celebrities (left me scarred without much recourse).  My skin is olive and it is very hard to find a reputable place to trust since I am prone to hyperpigmentation.  This place is the real deal, run by actual physicians! I won't go anywhere else period.<//Text>

<text>I highly recommend Smooth Skin Lounge for all medical spa procedures and treatments. I came here with my girlfriend and the staff was extremely professional and knowledgeable. They answered all our questions and explained the different services they offer (Botox, dermal fillers, facials, microneedling, etc.). They were warm and considerate, and they went above and beyond to accommodate us. It was a great experience (for a great price) and the results look incredible! If you’re looking for great customer service provided by experienced professionals who care about you and your wellbeing, for a competitive price, then this is it.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I love this medspa ! They have valet parking !! The place is so well kept and the employees are so professional. I really don’t know what more I could ask for. The entire team is so knowledgeable which is so important when it comes to getting any type of work done.

Smooth Skin is the place for beautiful skin.  From the moment you walk in to the second you leave, the entire staff are warm, friendly and extremely attentive.
During our first consultation, Dr. sat with me to discuss my concerns and goals.  From there we mapped out a conservative plan to combat wrinkles, sun spots, and maintain a youthful appearance by using Botox, a laser skin treatment on my neck, and an IPL photofacial followed by an Ultra Microneedling treatment. I am amazed by the results. I especially love seeing the before & after photos. The office is a beautiful oasis of calm and serenity. I choose to go to Smooth Skin because they are simply the best and I trust them. Loyal patient- Aaron</review>

<Review>This place is pleasantly awesome I had the best facial any one can ever ask for. The last place I had bin was a complete disasters they cut my side cheekbones in the process, I don’t know if it was their  first time doing a procedure but damb, I have a scar on my face. Well I gave this place a chance dispite my past bad experience. And they made me feel human again and not only did they do such a good job they also gave me cream for my scar and are going to help me with this scar. Thank you skin loung. They have free valet.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I bought a Groupon for Botox at Smooth Skin Lounge. From start to finish, I had a great experience. The receptionist was really nice and welcoming.  Christina did my injections and was so gentle and great at her placement of the product. I would absolutely be back to see the team at Smooth Skin Lounge.< /Text>

<text>I love Smooth Skin soo much. I can not wait for them to get there cryo machine installed. As a male I never thought a Medspa would become a frequented establishment for me. I now consider them my family ! When the cryo machine is installed and ready to go I can finally come there daily with out feeling like a weirdo !!!

Love you smooth skin!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I absolutely love this place,  I get my facials done here and every once in a while I need a little bit of Botox which Angela does perfectly being that I need to use my expressions for my line of work,  this is a very hard thing to find in Los Angeles because most people make you look frozen  she’s so kind, considerate and listens to exactly what I want, addressing all of my concerns. Lea and Caithlan are also so sweet and welcoming! Check them out!< /Review>< Resp>

<Text>Soooo I’ve been looking for a ligit Medspa forever and this place is it ! As a barber I look for professionalism and cleanliness. This place hits both of those point hard on the head. The atmosphere and employees are amazing.

I come here for the laser hair removal and the hydrafacials. I really recommend this place to anybody.

They hook it up!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2bd029807b1ef:0xd3fd7f8cc93565b5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<review>After my flight from Toronto my skin was in dire need of some love. After a bit of research i stumbled upon SSL and what a treat! I opted for the hydra facial because my skin was looking pretty dry and dull. The treatment was so relaxing and completely painless. My sensitve skin looked so revived after! It was exactly what i needed! If im ever back in LA i will definetly be back!</review>< pics>

I usually don’t post but truly had a great experience. I found this place on google places on my phone and figured I’d check them out since they had a special for 10% back on services if you purchase a product. I love La Mer products and they sell it for the same cost as most places I’ve purchased from so was happy to get a discount. The place is kind of hidden which is cool, I don’t need everyone seeing me walking into a spa... but the inside is beautiful and very modern. I looked through their retail section and realized they are carrying many of my regular brands so guess what lol I got those and $80 off my facial which I checked into yelp and got another 10% totaling it at $65 for my facial which was much less than the place I’ve been going to which is usually over $100. They are offering everything you could imagine like microbleading  and PRP vampire facial to peel facial and hair removal and skin tightening. Definitely coming back!< /text>

I have had really bad acne for a few years and went into this place with hopes of getting some kind of extraction they actually recommended I get a laser and I was apprehensive at first but afterwards I cannot see myself going anywhere else the results have been really good and I will definitely be coming back to the spot I advise anyone who has acne to try this I was afraid to try something new and come here they made me feel great< /review>

< review>
I loved my experience at Smooth Skin Lounge!

The location is beautiful and the front desk staff is so friendly and knowledgeable!

I had an appointment with Jacky for a hydrafacial, it was my first time having this treatment done so i didn't know what to expect. Jacky took the time to do a skin consult with me and make her suggestions to what would be best for my skin.
The actual treatment was so relaxing and my skin felt AMAZING after, so smooth and had a glow for days after!

Also while i was there i had questions about other treatments they did, such as Botox and fillers and was able to get all of my questions answered!

The location, staff, and treatments are some of the best! I would highly recommend them!< /review>

<Review>So aggravated with this place. I bought a Groupon and went there. It's all "fancy" take a bunch of pictures try to sell you more than what you bargained for... the Botox was diluted and they convinced me to have it placed in a different area than I wanted so I did Not get what I wanted. But I had not even bothered with a review until now. The appointment was in August, they ask for a credit card on file for broken appointments. I was naive and gave it to them. Suddenly now in October I got a $50 charge... I never went back since the Groupon, I opened a dispute with my credit card company and will also file a complaint with the better business bureau. Maybe they thought I wouldn't notice the charge. Whatever it is, save your money and go elsewhere. I'm so annoyed I read the other bad reviews and they say the same thing. Botox that doesn't work placed elsewhere! Yes they do offer gift cards for good reviews, to me it isn't worth it for someone else to have a bad experience while I get a miserable gift card if my experience wasn't good.</Review>< pictures>

Awful experience here. Staff was extremely non accommodating, lack of communication resulted in a horrible experience. They give gift cards for reviews which results for a lot of the positive ones. Botox experience ended up being a huge waste of time and a headache here.</review>
