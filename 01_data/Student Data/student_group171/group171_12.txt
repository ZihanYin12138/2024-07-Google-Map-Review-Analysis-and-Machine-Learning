<Review>I've ordered 2 times from this location through the app. The first time it took me 70 minutes to get my pizza, but the App gave me a free medium so I was fine with it. This time I ordered 2 mediums. 1 Buffalo ranch and 1 chicken Alfredo. The App said I would get my order from 20 - 45 minutes. I live 1 mile away so I thought it would be quick. I end up getting my order 90 minutes later and get 2 chicken alfredos. 1 box even had the right label for a Buffalo ranch so I'm not sure how they messed that up. I called afterwards and had someone try to get me off the phone quickly and just tell me I would get store credit for the pizza they got wrong, so there's that atleast.
Edit: picked up my medium store credit. I ordered a Chicken Buffalo ranch pizza. They skimped on the Chicken and Buffalo sauce, so it was more of a ranch pizza than anything. Still haven't heard back from corporate so I'm just done with Dominoes.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Excellent customer service, they are kind when they take your order. The pizzas have really good flavor, the dough is soft and crusty at the same time. They have a monitor where you can follow your order status and they always have good deals. Totally recommend this place!< /Review><userid>111413072232194405524< /userid>< Pics>

If I can could give this place 0 Stars I would. Ordered a pizza like around 10 they said I would be done in 30 minutes. It has been two hours and we have not gotten our pizza . Sad thing is we live down the street from the joint. Decided to go in person and they were closed guy in there was if ignoring my calls they let the phone keep ringing. Now tommorow morning soon as they open gotta go bust a Karen for not receiving my pizza. This place is a joke . Next time I'll be ordering pizza hut.</text>

The manager is rude will not take care of issues. He hung up on me instead of helping me and he would not give me his name. The delivery guy got here 40 minutes after the tracker said he left. I only live 4 minutes away from this Domino’s location< /text>

I used to love ordering here, however lately delivery has taken forever, and even when it was delivered parts of our orders were never delivered. We ordered two sodas and only received one, we then we told the other soda was in the car and they never came back. Ate a dinner paying for another soda we never got. This time our wings and bread were not delivered and we did not receive any sort of refund or compensation. Disappointed.</text>

Ordering ahead to save time is waste of time. I’ve had to wait EVERY TIME because they screw up my order. I’ve heard other customers complaining and on top of that, the chicken I ordered came with something black and gross inside of it.<//text>

<review>Defently want to stay away from this location..Grade is 1 star because there's nothing less than 1.. Bad customer service.. Original thought i was talking to a regular employee, to my surprise it turns out to be the manager. You could hear him nagging when i asked him simple questions. Now if that's there kind of service.. Imagine the food or even the sanitary part of the location. A business run by people that don't care.. Never again will i go to this location.. I will rather drive long distance and make sure service and quality is on top of there list.. Truly disappointed..

<Text>Time is 1:01 pm .. one pizza and one salad takes over an hour to make ? I placed the order exactly 53 mins ago . 20 mins ago tracker claims pizza is out of oven . This is the second time ordering delivery and having time issues. I do really like dominos but it’s sad that I can’t have it delivered any more . I’m done giving chances . This is crazy< /Text>< Resp>

Pizza is always good, the drivers are awesome.
Wish the parking situation had some room for improvement, for those who seek carry out.. but, oh well.
Try a thin crust with Alfredo sauce, chicken and bacon.. you’ll thank me later. :D</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
On Friday 9/1 I ordered pizza through the app and just as I was about to submit my order (had already selected my toppings and all) realized that I forgot to take off the garlic crust. Went back to edit my order finished and submitted it not realizing that by going back I had reset my whole order. When my pizza was delivered we went to eat and they were all cheese! I went to look at my confirmation email and it did say all cheese even though I know I selected toppings. I know I should of triple checked my order before submitting but didn't. I called the store and asked to speak to the manager I explained what happened and without hesitation he said "no worries I'll send you the right pizzas." I only now wish I could remember his name so that he could get the credit he deserves! I know it's just pizza but it's the customer service I received, it's very hard to come by now a days. It was hectic in my home as we were moving and the manager made my night just that much easier! So thank you to the manager who was working the night of 9/1 at around 7pm!< /Review>

Does Domino's Pizza is local to me and usually the location that delivers in my area. I've never had a problem with previous purchases from this location. My orders are always accurate and fairly priced!</review>

Epic! Quick to take my order but bad to refund my money on 2 large pizzas. Driver claims to of called our residents (no missed calls) and returned our meal back to dominos. 3calls later (1hang up) just to ask for money return. I tried to impress my family upgrading from "La Pizza LOCA" and it all went to..s**t. hungry kids and MAD WIFE..."all eyes on me. "La Pizza Loca" rescued dinner.< /Review>

They have good honest service and do great work.  Whether you are looking for new or to get one repaired, stop in.  I took my mower in to get fixed at the start of the season.  It took them a few weeks get to it because of how busy they were starting to get, but when they got to it they called me and let me know how much it would be.  The prices are fair =)</review>

Brought my mower in to be serviced.  Hours of operation on the website, window  and voicemail say they are open 8am-12 noon on Saturdays. Arrived at 11:20am and everything is locked up. Pulled into the dragon house parking lot to call, where I was only able to leave a voicemail. Hoping to find out what their actual hours of operation are so I can possibly try again.</review>

<Review>The reason I like Empire mowers, it's because I respect and support small business owners.  They're more personable that way, you're not just a number in a big giant store, and I respect that.  I called up Empire mowers to locate a gasket for my carburetor on my Briggs & Stratton engine. Which I couldn't find nowhere else.   Which I bought in 97 and still running just need some new parts. I spoke with the lady over the phone her name was Sandy, she was very helpful and knowledgeable.  I just had to give her the make model and type of numbers off the mower, they had the parts.  They had individual gaskets, partial carburetor gasket kits, and full carburetor gasket kits. And they are repair shop as well.  By the time I got down there to pick up the parts it was ready and waiting at the counter. Great customer service as well from Steve at the counter . That's why I give it 5 stars.  Support the small businesses

Overpriced compared to other dealers. I was in a tight spot and needed a machine right away and bought the kombi system from the first stihl dealer I could get to. I was overcharged 10%. I even asked if they could do anything about the pricing while ringing out and he said stihl doesn't do specials or discounts. I don't mind paying MSRP but I found out from other dealers that the product was marked up more than that<//Text>

I dropped off a mower for a warranty issue over 6 weeks ago and it still isn't done. I called (since they hadn't called in a while) and they said that they had part of it done so I could pick it up and use it while they get the rest of the parts. I hung up the phone and immediately got in my car and arrived  2 minutes before closing. However, they had already locked up the store and would not get the mower for me. This process has been very frustrating.<//Text>

I was in town for 3 months temporarily for work. When I left, I signed some documents at the front desk and paid $100 for early cancellation. Now 12 months later I'm getting a call from a collections office stating I owe $500.

Do not do business with them.< /Review>

<user>102410021456165139968</user><text>This gym was a good place until I had to move and my issue of cancellation & refund came into play. People at the front desk are friendly and welcoming  but the GM and higher ups are all about money and not about community or personal help. I am a single mother to two young children and they would not even allow me to transfer my membership to another gym down south. Even after they got all of Garden's customers they just care about money and they take from you. I had even spoken with multiple other Golds Gyms who stated that they charge a cancellation fee but would easily refund the remaining 9 months I had left to help me out. Not only did they not refund or allow transfer but they ignored my emails and delayed communication as much as possible.  It is sad to see such poor management and poor customer service. If I were to consider any gym in the Monterey area on return, this would be the last place.< /text>< gmapID>

The facility itself is fine. Very nice weight sets and universal machines. Hours are convenient and in general the gym is very clean.
However, I was a member since it opened and was treated poorly when I needed to close out my membership.
I suffered a cancer that left me debilitated to the point I could not even visit the gym to cancel my membership in writing.
I was given the name of the general manager and his email. My emails were ignored for weeks. Phone calls and messages were ignored.
Finally a month into the attempt to cancel the general manager wrote me back and said he would cancel my month to month contract but conveniently added another month to the membership.
This was an obvious grab for a few more dollars and it was frankly insulting.
Even though my attempt to cancel began a month before the general manager stalled knowing full well he would charge me for one last month.
It was bad enough the gym would spring annual membership 'dues' to the tune of $50. on top of the membership fee but to stall on an obvious ailing long time member for a few dollars speaks to either the individual manager or the corporate philosophy in general.
When I am better I will not be returning to Gold's Gym. There are other gyms.< /Text>

Great gym! I just joined and they have all the latest equipment. David Navarro signed me up and he was awesome! The staff is always friendly and helpful. It is never too crowded and they have duplicates of the most used machines so you are never waiting for a squat rack like other gyms I've been to. Overall, great price and a great experience!< /review>

Great staff and welcoming attitude.  They greet you coming in the door and bid you farewell on your way out.  Donna was at the desk this evening and was very sweet to me and my daughter.  We were trying out the gym for our first day of a trial membership.  The gym wasn't crowded and there were no typical "gym rats" hogging all the mirrors.  It was a nice experience.  I could see paying $50/mo.  Great equipment and very sanitary.  Showers and sauna available as well as a cardio section and a cross-fit area.  Plenty of space and all necessary equipment is on-site.< /review>

This place is run by crooks.  They illegally acquired my credit card info from another gym in town and charged me without me ever signing a contract.  They than made me sign a cancellation form even though I never signed a contract to begin with and refused to refund my money.  Luckily my bank took care of that for me.</review>

I've been going to this gym for almost a year. It is a great facility with modern equipment. The only negative thing is how high they play the music. It is pretty loud even when you are wearing your headphones. Aside from that, great gym.</Text>

<Review>I've stopped in during construction several times, signed up to be on your mailing list multiple times--I've never received a call back from anyone.  So I forgot about Golds and stayed with my membership at In Shape until one of your instructors recommended I give you a call.  Here I am again, I've sent an email and today I called and spoke with a woman who was checking in clients instead of speaking with me.  I asked to have someone call me about memberships, and the lovely young lady hung up on your prospective member.  Nice beginnings!  It's Sunday 9-11 at 11 AM.  I'd check into who is answering your phones if I were you.  I've a former member of Golds in San Diego.  Will someone please call me with membership information?  Thank you,< /Review>< Response>

<Text>I recently visited this Gold's location while on vacation last week in the area. The location was cool. In a mall area but sunday morning not packed at all. Equipment was clean and new. Weights were racked in position. Had a few things most gyms dont..i like that. Staff was friendly and visit charge was only $15. Other locations I've visited were $25. Overall great experience and workout. Definitely will be back when im in the area.< /Text>< GmapID>

I was in town for 3 months temporarily for work. When I left, I signed some documents at the front desk and paid $100 for early cancellation. Now 12 months later I'm getting a call from a collections office stating I owe $500.

Do not do business with them.<//Text>

No more waiting for machines while they are being tied up by someone too busy texting, fiddling with their ipods etc. This place is clean and loaded with all the latest and greatest. Super friendly and helpful staff as well :) I debated writing this review for selfish reasons only...I like that it is not super packed with people but I'm sure all that will change eventually.</Text>< Pictures>

The space is huge, but not so big that you feel lost, the equipment is very high end, and everyone who works here is SO welcoming and kind. Jen signed me up, and I have trained with her husband T.C., and with Julio and Cory and they are all amongst the best trainers I have ever met.  I spent the most time training with Julio and he is extremely creative, knowledgable and most importantly, he knows how to push me when I need it. ;)  Thank you to everyone at Gold's Gym Monterey for creating such a wonderful environment.

Public storage on Appian Way has been a great experience. I have rented with other companies in the past but decided to try Public this go around...The customer service specifically Justine was beyond any expectations I may have had. Justine was extremely attentive and kind. Often young people do not know what it means to provide excellent service but Justene went above and beyond, I truly appreciate her level of customer satisfaction.</Review>

Outstanding customer service.  From my first call with Leslie to the time I checked in with her in person, she provided excellent customer service.  Very helpful, but what I appreciated most was her positive attitude and professionalism.<//Review>

I couldn't give them zero star because it wouldn't allowed me to so I have to give it a 1 star. I called to find out how much price for a unit but end up getting hang up the 1st time. 2nd time I called back, the automatic voice messager say press 1 if for a quote and 2 for existing customers, I press 1 and end up getting hung up again. Most awful customer service in my honest opinion. Whoever hired these workers must not do their homework or like to hired rude people for the position.<//text>

<Review>The staff! By far, the staff are the sweetest and most knowledgeable we have ever met! Leslie is wonderful!!
We have had to help several family members move over the last few years and have had to use many different storage facilities across the states.
This site is great! Love the access hours! (There is also an added bonus of a CLEAN restroom to use :) The facility is nice and clean, too!
Leslie lives on-site and is always super kind and helpful. We are so happy we found this place, and Leslie, too!! :)<//Review>< pictures>

Bobbie is awesome! Since the day I moved in she helped me find the right size unit for a good price and now has helped me transfer units for a lower price. Couldn’t ask for better customer service, THANK YOU!</Text>

Leslie is an awesome employee and so understanding! I've had so many instances of falling behind on payments. She's helped me out multiple of times and always made the attempt to give me a courtesy call reminding me about my storage payments. The property is so easy to store your belongings and reasonable when it comes to pricing. I've stored my personal belongings at this Public Storage property for about 8-9 years. Thank you so much!<//review>

Moving is very stressful and Leslie made my move very easy and painless. She answered all my questions in a pleasant, open manner and made some very helpful suggestions. She had a couple open spots and let me look at them to choose which one I prefer. She is very customer oriented. She made some really great jokes, which lightened my mood. I believe having a great manager can make all the difference. Also, I called in the other day and spoke to another employee. She was very patient with me, as I was very confused and irritable. I'm grateful for her patience. I'm very glad I chose Public Storage at this location.</text>

Leslie was great!! She was so personable in helping us find a unit. We came in totally frazzled and stressed out, and her positive attitude brought us back down to planet earth.  She keeps the property clean and her customers love her. When we were going to see the space at least 3 different people said hello to her! You dont see great customer service like this anymore!</review>

My friend is a new customer at this location. I helped him rent and move in. We enjoyed the convenience of this location. He is elderly and we appreciated Andrea's patience. She got him a unit that's easy accessible. I've known people who have rented here for years and I've only heard good things. Glad to see my friend will be in good hands here.< /Text>

<Review>I had reserved a unit online, but when I got there Leslie asked some questions and determined I could go with a smaller (and cheaper) unit. Good customer service! Was easy to get in/out, everything was clean and secure. No trouble moving out, no surprise extra charges. Highly recommend!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<text>This was a great, easy experience checking in with Leslie. She was fast and efficient at showing me the storage unit and explaining costs. Also I purchased several items, boxes, sofa covers and such to make a smooth move to the unit. I would highly reccomend Leslie at Public Storage to help with a rental of a storage unit.< /text>< Pics>

<review>I am moving and have to store many boxes. There are so many of them, I had to rent a second storage unit. I wanted it to be not far from my first one. Many thanks to Stacy who was efficient,  helpful,  and very friendly. Great job, Stacy! Many thanks, indeed.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Stacey is a great rep for Public storage. As a customer her careful attention and service gave my wife and me the steps to have our storage needs nearby, since we are planning to move. This makes a convenient source for our storage needs at the price that is affordable not like the other storage facility that acquaint you exaggerated service and price. Keep it up, Stacey!</Review>

I witnessed a guy who was very rude verbally attack the young lady Stacy who works there. I must say she held her composure and handled the situation very well. She made sure the customers around her were taken care of swiftly and with professionalism. I would highly recommend this storage facility.  Great customer service.<//Text>

Good self storage with a friendly employee that resides above the office at the only entrance.  Gated and as secure a storage facility I've seen. The hours of access are great.< /Text>

It is the most hassle free experience at any place I have had. Stacey is amazingly nice. This is coming from someone who rarely writes reviews. I  needed to rent a place to store all my belongings when I was abroad. Never a moment of worry, thanks to my faith in Stacey managing the property really well.</text>

Stacy was very helpful and understanding as I needed help with a large appliance that couldn't fit in my unit. She gave me options on how I could make it work. Nothing worked but she went above and beyond trying to help me. Very nice to work with. Would highly recommend.< /Review>

We had a wonderful experience with the help of Stacey while we had an unfortunate medical emergency while at our storage. Her support and "friendship" ( I met her for the first time) we are forever thankful for. She made sure we were able to make it to the appropriate places we needed to go to while supporting us in a time of need. Thank you very much Stacey and Public Storage.</text>

Nicole was great!  She called as soon as I booked the reservation online and then walked me through the rest of the steps along the way.  When I was onsite, she showed me multiple units that were my size and let me pick the best location for my needs.  I have been using Public Storage for a number of years and really enjoy the customer service and ease of transferring locations when it has been needed.< /text>

I was driving to this location from San Jose and hit a bunch of traffic, Stacy stayed an hour past closing time to get me all settled!  Saved my butt.  Not only did she stay overtime but she handled everything quickly, efficiently and professionally.  I've since had a couple phone conversations with her and each time she's been nothing but help.

This was my 3rd time coming to this storage location and I must admit I was dreading going thru this process again! No one likes having to stare their stuff no matter how long or short! However, surprisingly it’s was the most PAINLESS,QUICK,PLEASANT EXPERIENCE I have EVER had at a public storage facility! Leslie the newbie was polite knowledgeable and considerate to my time and needs and I was in and out in less than 30 mins with a NEW UNIT after seeing 3 different units! She’s awesome and definitely knows how to handle this business! #supersatisfiedcustomer #10stars if I could have< /Review>

I came to public storage with a friend who was looking to rent a unit. This is what my friend said about her experience. "The young lady there Stacy helped me. Even though the size of the units available may not work for me, Stacy took the time to show us diffferent sizes and explained how we could make it work. I may actually go on Stacy' recommendations and get the unit anyways. The place is clean and the young lady is very friendly and is a pleasure to talk to. Very professional. Highly recommend."<//Review>

I came to public storage with a friend who was looking to rent a unit. This is what my friend said about her experience. "The young lady there Stacy helped me. Even though the size of the units available may not work for me, Stacy took the time to show us diffferent sizes and explained how we could make it work. I may actually go on Stacy' recommendations and get the unit anyways. The place is clean and the young lady is very friendly and is a pleasure to talk to. Very professional. Highly recommend."<//Text>

If you rent here, Plan on doing your own security. Highly recommend NOT to RENT from this facility. Theft is out of control.  They have a camera at the front gate and they have surveillance in a few hallways.  After being broke into twice!  I began to do my own investigation.  The camera at the front gate is useless and not clear. People were able to slide in undetected..  The cameras that were suppose to be filming on the street areas ,so it could show who is driving around or walking inside the unit were not even installed .  The monitor for the surveillance in the office with the manager was not even working , Then when the new monitor was replaced in the office.  It video two hallways of lower levels unit onlys.  After talking to corporate office CEO, They stated, “ that there is not supposed to be cameras in any of the storage units  hallways”,,  it was only suppose to be located on the street area between the units.  Although, the on site manager has stated diffently about the camera locations.  I was approved to watch the video footage from district manager Chuck, I personally witness two cameras located in two hallways of the lower levels units.  And have watched the video of the hallways being recorded. Even though corporate says they are not supposed to have cameras in the hallways. The question now is,  Why, NO cameras in the upper units?  That’s a million dollar questions. If your going to offer video surveillance. Why not put it on all the hallways for all the paying customers. This is a very unprofessional facility.  Even corporate didn’t know what they were talking about!  I personally witness someone living in one of the lower level units one evening.  I reported it to the manager.  Of course this was all  after the break in to my unit and serveral other peoples units. When you rent you expect your stuff to be safe.  You put a public storage lock on our unit , that supposedly they cannot be cut off from what the manager says! Although,   My locks were Picked!       I would like to add that the new On site manger Leslie was very nice, with strong customer service skills. After they finally got her moved in to monitor and watch the facitily as her job responsibilities.  She began to monitor cars that were coming and going.  It was her that spotted a car in the facility after hours one evening and she called Pinole Police and Two people we’re arrested and charge with braking into units with burglary tools and and were caught with lots of stuff from other peoples units red handed located in there vehicle. Although, they could not charge these people nor recover any of my stuff or stuff stolen from other peoples units from weeks before,  because there was no surveillance showing them stealing and breaking in to the units.  I spoke to corporate about what a great job there manager Leslie did , above and beyond.  I thought she would get an award or some kind of recognition for doing her job. Unfortunately, Corporate Office informed me that Leslie was not suppose to check her computer to see who came through the front gate  nor do anything after hours of 5pm.  Corporate yelled at Leslie and told her she is not to be in her office after hours.  I felt bad for her getting into trouble so I purchased coffee for Leslie and apologize for corporate lack of customer care and employee policy. I thought I was doing a good thing .  I was proud of her brave act.    From that time on Leslie wasn’t so nice and cheerful when I showed up to vacate my unit. I completely understand!<//Text>

The manager Stacy is very perfessional,she's very friendly.If there is a problem regarding  billing or any thing  she's more than eager to go over everything so u understand,she answers all questions u may have and she pulls no punches she tells u exactly what is going on all fees taxes and more.shes an A1 employee in my book.</Review>

<text>Sharmika is an amazing Public Storage representative. She is civil, competent and willing to assist customers beyond what is expected. And,  Sharmika does so with a smile. Today, it was storming raining and I had a question about my storage. Sharmika did not just answer me from the office but came out in the rain to respond. Again, she did so with a smile. Sharmika is a model representative and I am so grateful that she works at the location where my storage unit is located.<//text>< pics>

If you have to pay for storage, go see the manager, Stacy.  She is the only reason I decided to rent a space.  She knows the meaning of customer service!  She goes the extra mile - thanks, Stacy.<//review>

<Review>They are so kind to my dad who’s house was burned down in the fires. I’m so grateful. I live on the East Coast, and he wanted to stay near Paradise to get back and see the wreckage of his house. They are proving so much for the victims of this fire.<//Review>< Pictures>

I personally dnt go to church but my family goes to this one. And they have a nursery. Two. Different ones for different ages. And I started sending my son with my aunt wen he was a baby as a way to start socializing him from a young age so he'd one day be ready for school. He's now almost 6 yrs old & has a little brother who also goes with him and they both love it! I've met sum of the ppl & my Aunt volunteers in the nursery. They're real nice.<//Text>

Come 5-6 pm they are always out of everything from the steam trays. last time one of the workers slammed my food into the bag hard enough to rupture my egg roll sauce, I could tell she was having a hard day so I didn't push it.
Just know that it seems like management is a mess here just based of my negative interactions with the employees and quantities of food available. I would avoid this location for dinner but say it's fine for earlier in the day.
Unfortunately I give this location 2 stars for their quality and service, I highly recommend the location on E Hospitality lane way more than this.</Review>

All I can say is I hope the store manager or corporate reads this. Your worker Jenny was absolutely awesome I saw her make multiple orders as well as deal with a very rude customer and still kept her head. She needs to be promoted for her hard work and people skills. Jenny great work keep it up.<//Review>

This Panda Express is OK. Kind of inconsistent. We eat there about once a month. Sometimes fresh and hot food, sometimes old and cold. There is always something we want that they tell us will be 20 minutes until it's ready. Not good when going through a drive through. Tonight's meal was so so. Maybe next time will be better.< /Review>

They are always busy here but never cease to keep the line moving efficiently. I decided to order inside (instead of wait for the drive-through) this time around. One of the employees, Jenny, was extremely busy with online orders but still jammed out my order without any hesitation. Will keep coming back, as usual.< /review>

<Review>Panda Express food is so so it's edible however it is NOT a real gourmet Chinese food as they advertise. You could google it yourselves. Every time I go to panda express I get asked if I want to donate to children's hospital or education etc. They even ask if I want to round up my change. The employee's are trained to panhandle. This is the only franchise that does this not McDonald's, burger king etc. I'm sure McDonald's donate to charities as well without making their employees solicite. I understand it's for a good cause but due to pandemic money is tight. Also why only children. What about the homeless or people that are unemployed or doesn't have healthcare etc. How about donations to diabetics or even cancer research???.  Here's a thought. Why not panda express group become a nonprofit franchise restaurant.. all the proceeds would go to charities..<//Review><GmapID>0x80c355d5c5d71db3:0x8804a9e9a0a8e75b< /GmapID>< pictures>

<Text>So, management didn't want to waste any white rice. So, they didn't make any at 9:00pm. So, I didn't get anything to eat or drink. I mean.. it's just white rice... now, I have to spend 5 dollars in gas to drive to a different location to get my triple plate. It's just 5 dollars in gas. Not coming back to this location again.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It's nice to have the option of going inside to order your meal. Although you can't eat inside. But it is nice to go inside rather than wait in the Drive-Thru< /Review>

This place is always clean when i come here. Even before the pandemic  i never saw it gross or dirty. The fact they still clean even  during the time theres no dine in is amazing. They were checking the food temp too making sure its the right temp fit for serving and consumption. Our server Daisy was kind , patient, and helpful. Thanks for the food! (:</text>

<Text>Don't always get the orders right. If you go through the drive thru dont leave without checking your order. It is a serious problem. Now my family loves the food at panda and this particular panda is the closest to us, so we continue to go. We went today to get food for my kids on the way home. We ordered a couple 2 entrees and an order of spring rolls. At the window we check and no spring rolls. So we tell the little girl and she brought us the spring rolls. My husband says you guys always get our orders wrong a d the girls says super snooty "then don't co.e back". Belive me we won't be back and we are sorry we continued to come. Beware dont eat at this particular panda.  They simply dont care about us as customers. Maybe new management is needed.< /Text><Rate>1<//Rate><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Looks as though their served with only one scoop a table spoon scoup on the main sides like there chicken mushroom and beef an broccoli side i went last night an opened my plate up an said for the money they charge Panda is sure CHEAP SERVING THERE MAIN SIDES BUT LOVE TO DISH OUT THE FRIED RICE AN THE NOODLE SIDES!!

Every time I attended your location, the food was always disgusting. I love panda express, but this location serves old food. Nothing tastes fresh at all.</text>

<Text>Another trip to Panda Express and glad we did. Fresh, hot, and quick service. The Beijing Beef was great!!! Sweet Fire Chicken Breast is always so good too! I'm a pineapple lover. 😊  So far every time we have gone to P.E. (in Highland) it has been worth it! Yes, I recommend!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>What a beautiful view!! The food was good and the service was fast and friendly. We ordered through drive thru and had to wait a little bit for our food. But the eait was worth it. The food was fresh and delicious. We haven't had Panda Express in years and yesterdays visit did not disappoint. Strongly reccomend it.< /Review>< userid>

<review>The Panda Express is a welcomed edition to the eateries along the 210 freeway near Highland. The menu is varied with mild and spicy entries with a selection of portion sizes to appease most appetites. Being a new build there are plenty of seating arrangements for single diners to booths for cozy couples and long tables for groups.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c355d5c5d71db3:0x8804a9e9a0a8e75b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My online order said 9:10 pm I'm still here at 9:25 pm. Cooks walking around like they don't care. Cashiers act like they didnt know where my order was, they dont have all the items.  People come in and leave before my order is complete. Customer service suck this March 27 at 9:27 pm and I been coming to Panara Express every friday 5 years. This is crazy rude.<//review>

Do not recommend this place to ANYONE—SECOND TIME GETTING FOOD POISONING at this location. I’m NEVER going back again. The first time, one can forgive and forget since we’ve been loyal customers of Panda, but we’ve only ate at this specific location 3-4 times. We ordered yesterday through the drive-thru and my dad and I had the worse night ever. We could not leave the restroom. Constant nastiness going on in there. Today we woke up feeling so weak and our body is in pain. Please save yourself the trouble and if you care about your stomach, don’t eat their nasty food. If I could give less starts I would.< /review>

You got to be kidding me went to Panda again today October 3rd 2019 portions are half the size as they used to be think I'll find another restaurant.</review>< Pics>

I like to give everyone 2nd chance. Big mistake. A street food vendor is more safer than these guys.
I wanted to see from inside eventhough @7pm there was only one car in the drive through. The server have to band down to scoop from inner trays, which makes them litterly over customers orders/food.  Chefs and servers constantly speaking & laughing loud without wearing a mask.
Sadly the manager was no different than employees. Serve food and handle cash with same gloves.
I bought a scoop of shrimps for $5. Which is $1 per 1 shrimp. Only thing cheap here is quality. I hope my message gets to health department.
Good luck to all the customers. Stay safe and stay away.
Look at the 5 stars with pictures. This place is dead and will be closing soon. I think all the good commenters are employees and family<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I was so excited for this place to open and so far I've been there three times. Out of all those times I've been there the employees are all friendly and nice. However, the portions are not good! For what you pay for one plate and the amount of food you get is just pathetic. My old local Panda at UCR in Riverside used to fill those plates to the top where you could not close the plate. This Highland one is trying to rip off its' customers or they are just not noticing.<//text>< Pics>

Recently opened... great service and food. There is a large and very clean eating area, which I enjoyed, and a drive-thru for those who choose that option.

Would definitely return here.< /text>

<review>I remember waiting for this Panda Express to open. Finally had a chance to stop in. The store was clean and the employees very nice. The food though lacked the quality ive come to expect from Panda Express. The rice was rather dry and the orange chicken lacked its usual character. But I'll give the benefit of the doubt, its a new Panda and my hopes is the quality of the food will improve.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I'm done with Panda Express. 1. For almost $9, I expect a human sized portion, not a kids menu plate. Give me a break. 2. I've come to the conclusion that if you don't go inside, but through the drive thru, your portion will be a kid size portion. 3. Eaten a few times in the past at this specific location, and have told my family that the chow mein is dry, as is the fried rice. Against my better judgement, I agreed to another visit. My kid drove through the drive thru, brought the food home. Yup, just like before the chow mein and the fried rice were dry, and the portions ridiculously small. Poor reviews on your own site, and Google say to go in, and not through the drive thru if you want to not get ripped off. The drive thru portion is just small, and terrible. I'm finished/done with Panda Express. By the way, the chicken was very good. Will my little ($27.00 total) family order make a difference to them? Probably not. I shouldn't have to wait till I get home to discover poor service. There are many authentic Chinese food joints that don't charge $9 (or close to it) for a real adult portioned meal. Don't expect any good recommendations from me, but I will definitely recommend not patronizing this place.<//review>

Poor customer service. The drive-thru seem all importance and the paying customers standing in front of them are insignificant. Food was Luke-Warm and the Chow-Mein was 3/4 vegetables. This was my first time here and I can only hope that this was not typical for this location. It's gonna take me a minute to want to go back and try them again. Best of luck folks. Hope your experience is better then mine was.<//Review>

Food is always good . I love panda Express! Customer service was not so great I felt the girl helping us at the drive thru was super impatient and a little rude. The portions are terrible! I get it . It's not a hole in the wall that packs your plates but if you pay  $1.25  extra for steak atleast put a full scoop of it . I literally had like 3 tiny pieces of steak . I hope my next experience is better.< /text>

Love how Convienent this location is for me. The food taste Great! It can get really busy at times, but they always manage to have people out quickly. The only flaw i have noticed, is that some days the Chow mein will be dry or too many vegetables. Also the food seems to have more and look better when u order inside instead of drive thru. Not a bad spot though.< /text>

Went here yesterday for the first time. I've had Panda Express in the past in Orange County. I'm not a fan, but I still wanted to give this place a shot due to it just opening in Highland. The management & crew were awesome, The food was lacking flavor and was very dry. I was disappointed. I wanted this place to be better than it is. I'm still on the hunt for a Chinese food place that still cooks Kung Pao chicken with the peanuts inside. This place had it like that but lacked spice & flavor.</review>

Got my food to go and the girls that serviced me were nice. The quality of the food was what I'd expect from any Panda Express, but the quantity and ratio was off. Haven't tried the drive thru, but I never thought a drive thru for Chinese food is really fast food ain't it.<//Review>

I was a little excited when I first found out about panda Express opening. Today I was very disappointed, the place is clean and well staffed the parking is accessible. The down side was the portion on plates was very disappointing and food was cold. In this matter I just rather go to panda star where food is cooked fresh and their portions are reasonable.< /text>

Horrible experience and customer service at that, walked in got greeted to just stand there for over 10 minutes while everyone just stands around and talks instead of helping the customers that kept on walking in. I didnt even order I left to jack in the box next door !</Review>

< Review>
So sad that we didn't have a good experience. The woman taking our order in the drive thru was speaking so fasf and rushing us, she took our order wrong. Then a difddiffe girl at the window had an attitude with us because we had to correct the order. We said thank you and she rolled her eyes, so unprofessional. The food wasn't good either. We usually go to the one in Redlands. By the looks of the comments this new one may not be open long.</Review>

<Text>On 05-27-21 at 1330 hours i order 2 plates through drive thru. The cashier messed up on my order. I order orange chicken, walnut shrimp with veggies. They did not put shrimp instead they put beff with veggies. The orange chicken was to sour!! She also told me to park on the parking lot. They took 10-15 minutes to bring me my food. Last time I told them I don't want to park because of the same reasons they gave me an attitude and wanted to refused service. They need to stop forcing people to park and threatening. Ticket number #2990<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) They don't know how to treat decent people, they tend more for people to argue, I ran into each other with a discussion between two people
They asked her to go to Mrs. who was being disturbed by a current that since she arrived she got to the line in front of many people and ended up fighting with that lady and her daughter very bad service

(Original)
No saben tratar a la gente decente tienden más por la gente arguendera yo me topé el otro con una discusión entre dos personas
Le pidieron que se fuera a la Sra que estaba siendo molestada por una corriente que desde que llegó se metió a la línea enfrente de mucha gente y terminó peleando con esa señora y su hija servicio muy malo<//review>

<gmap_id>0x808e34ba81b874b3:0x27d4883c91adb811<//gmap_id><name>Derek Anderson</name><review>**Updated** with photo proof, due to re-buttle from the business. Doris Yao does infact service more than ONE location. This business continues to be deceptive.

This company is deceptive, dishonest and aggressive.

They contacted me after securing the location of a closed dental office and began to comb through left over records from a botched business plan.

The business resumed running after Doris/Yujia Yao began management of Dental on Capitol and Senter.

The business misled me into believing that it was the same company, and that I would be booking normal annuals.

Upon arriving, I noticed that the business was no actually the same, and questioned what this new business was.

I was given a card and credentials were hanging on the wall as late as October 26th of 2018, informing patients that this facility is now run by "Dental Group of Doris Yao".

Besides being mislead, there are several serious questions about hygine of this office, and cleanliness of the tools, the dentist's were not supervised and lacked skill.

Be careful here, and ask for lots of documentation upfront to have them prove who they are, that they are licensed and insured.< /review>< rate>

Dr. Yao is hands down The BEST dentist in the Bay Area. She is deeply caring, kind, and so generous with her time. My cavity was so bad that it almost reached my nerve. Dr. Yao spent almost 2 hours to do my filling and cleaning to make sure that I don’t need to suffer from a root canal. I can not imagine being treated by any other dentists. Again, not one of the best but THE BEST!!!!!</Text>

<Review>I found Dr. Yao through a Facebook listing a few years ago before it was called “Captain Dental”. From the moment I met her, I knew I’d stick with her. Dr. Yao and Gina made my family and I feel at home. They are easy to talk to and very accommodating, if needed. Just recently I completed my very first implant placement procedure. In between completing my implant I’ve had other work done and Dr. Yao never disappoints. She is very knowledgeable in her field, I’m definitely happy I found her and look forward to seeing her again.</Review><user_name>Kimberly Carter</user_name><Date>1616203976524</Date>< Response>

<text>I did my first dental cleaning with Dr Yao, she is very detailed and professional at doing the job and she is also very objective in reviewing my teeth conditions and provide the right suggestions.
During Covid,  i also did some filling at Captain Dental, they have very comprehensive tool kit that cover up everything that a patient might have contact during the service and they throw them away after finishing the job, I feel very safe to get my service done here.<//text>< pics>

I was once in dilemma of choosing a dental clinic and I am glad that I found the right place. Having done several tooth fillings and a root canal here in Captain Dental, I am impressed by Dr. Yao and her team's professionalism. Clean environment, transparent charges, advanced equipments and Dr. Yao's patience on patients, with all these in mind, I'd definitely recommend it to those who are seeking for dental assistance!< /text>

This was my 2nd visit in my treatment and from my 1st I must say I was totally looking forward to the gentle and compassionate touch only Dr. Yao can give.

<text>Best dental ever! I'm super sensitive to pain and heard Dr. Yao and her team are specializing in painless treatment, therefore I switched to Captain Dental after having nightmares at other dentals. Dr. Abadir is my primary dentist, she's super professional, friendly and detail-oriented. Most importantly, you barely feel the pain when she's numbing you. The whole procedure with her was very smooth and comfortable, and she can always finish her job perfectly on time. Dr. Yao is also super helpful and caring to her patients, who had helped me answer many questions and solved the problem. Highly recommended!!</text>< pictures>

Went to clean my teeth two weeks before. Dr Yao is professional, polite and very helpful. Upon checking my teeth, she found other issue about my teeth. She did not suggest some expensive and painful solution. Instead, she provide me with cheaper, easier and effective solution.
I would recommend anyone i know to Dr Yao's place in the future. Her honesty earned a happy customer. :)</review>

Dr. Yao and her staffs run a very professional and friendly office. I was first greeted by the assistants and seated in the chair. The assistants were very patient when taking my X-rays. Dr. Yao did a thorough exam and explained in details of what I need and made sure that I fully understood my treatment plan. Every procedure I needed was explained in detail for me and she didn’t force me to do any unnecessary treatment. My boyfriend had two wisdom teeth extracted by Dr. Yao. She was very gentle with the injection. ‘I didn’t feel a thing’ as he described. I would highly recommend Dr. Yao and her office to anyone who is seeking a reliable dentist.<//text>

I am a new patient here at Captain Dental.  I love the care and attention that is provided here.  I am in the process of getting tooth implants.  Dr. Doris Yao has such a calm demeanor and gentle touch,  she puts me at ease as I am very apprehensive about dental work. Dr. Yao is very professional and makes my visits enjoyable.   The office and location is very clean.  I am planning on transitioning all my family to this Dental practice.  I highly recommend!</review>

< Review>
Want to have your tooth removed? This is your place. I came to this office for my last 2 wisdom teeth removal, after being transferred from 2 other dental offices. The bottom one was a very large tooth and impacted the one next to it. Doctor Yao was very patient and gentle on my case. She made sure that the area was completely numb/painless before she started on the procedure. It seriously took her only 15 MINUTES to get the top wisdom tooth out. NO KIDDING. My teeth are hard and sturdy as rock. Before my braces, an average size male doctor tried to pull my pre-molar. It cost him more than 1 HOUR and 2 BREAKS in the middle to get the job done. The bottom one was a bit trickier, but still not a big problem to Dr. Yao. Two other offices transferred me to a specialist because of this tooth, but to Dr. Yao it was just a simple surgical procedure. She had to cut it in half to get it out. Sewed the wound in and let me walk out of the office in the next 45 minutes. The wounds stopped bleeding the day after with a mild fever (which is normal for tooth removal). I can't thank her enough for saving me a trip to specialist just to have the same thing done. Noticed one thing that she's really not a talker. I supposed she's just like me. I don't really talk during my work but instead, paying 100% attention to it. So don't let it turn you off<//Review>

I have worked temporarily for Dr. Doris Yao at Captain Dental as a Dental Hygienist .   I would highly recommend Dr. Doris Yao as a top notch dentist .
If fact I would trust her with my care when my 2 family members are close to retirement.
What people , who are not in the dental field should know , is first of all the office practices all the proper protocols for ADA and CDA  (American Dental Association and California Dental Association ) for sterilization  and  ethical standards.
Dr. Doris Yao is kind ( listens ) gentle ( light touch with injections and procedures). And extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of her provided services. An example,  her office in San Jose
1670 Westwood Dr Suite k 95125 is small. I worked in the small room furthest from the front desk .  I had no clue she was performing an extraction or an implant , I did not hear a sound from the patient ( in my 20 years experience, that is rare) just comforting words from Dr Yao and her assistant.  And she is quick precise and extraordinarily gifted.  I have worked for at least 30 Dentists in my career. Not all possess these traits.  Gentle Thorough Humble Human Competent Punctual.</review>

The park has potential but seems the city hasn't kept it up. Some neat hut like picnic areas, plethora of benches some shaded some not. Restroom building looks like a shady shack. Kids play areas are okay. There's an old area that looks like it was for sand/water before but no longer has either. The entrances are a bit tricky. Just dead end of one of 2 cul de sacs. The huts are actually covered in grapes Vines!<//text>

Nice park except the locals are leaving there trash and beer bottles on the tables and trashing the trails.  Needs more cleaning and TLC.< /text>

Its an average neighborhood park..decent playground...generally clean..its along the wash...good place to walk a dog or exercise safely. Some transients...but ive found they are generally harmless.< /Text>

It's a hidden oasis lined against the riverbed.  Not a big park,  but enough space to play a game of baseball or football.  Nice picnic areas surround the open field. Bbq pits available.  Bike trail along the river.</text>

It's a cute park equipped with everything! A restroom, a playground, a playground for younger ones, a mini trail that goes round, beautiful grass in between, many benches, and a sign that shows the emerald necklace. Enjoyable.</Text>

Some really nice elements - tables with shade, play area, trails - and all with a native American theme. But it needs some upkeep.< /text>

The Native America Trail certainly needs maintenance. Many overgrown shrubs and graffiti on the signs.</review>

(Translated by Google) It is not the super park but it is good for children under 10 years old, it has a good view of planes every minute.

(Original)
No es el super parque pero esta bien para niños menores de 10 años, tiene buena vista a avionetas cada minuto.</Text>

Seidner’s were  professional, courteous  and  caring people, my car was ready a day early. Mr John and Ms Cassandra were so nice to me that make me feel at home and confident that my car was in good hands and it was true, they keep me update of the status of my car , they did an excellent job.
I  recommend this great place with my eyes closed !
Thank you very much Seidner’s .

< Review>
I strongly recommend Seidners Auto Body for their professionalism, great office ethics, and detailed work. I went to the Duarte location and received great assistance from Marcos who came through in having the car properly worked on and ready for use during the holidays . Mercedes was also wonderful providing me with information on the rentals. Seidners  staff was exemplary in following the CDC guidelines. My car was clean looked brand new , I’m absolutely happy with the way everything turned out.</Review>

<Review>Although I’ve never lived in a small town, Seidner’s gives you that small town feeling.  The receptionist was so nice and friendly and the person that gave me the estimate made me feel welcome and at home and confident that they would do a great job for me. I would definitely come back here again< /Review>< pictures>

I had someone back into my front right bumper in a parking lot and messed up my paint. I took the 2006 F250 down to Seinder's Collision and treated me pretty good. There establishment is very clean and professional. They had a big job to do because I run a Road Armor heavy steel bumper with a warn 16.5Ti winch and 4 head lights in the bumper. Suffice to say its well over 300lbs. It was done the right way, removed, repaired ,repainted. I had to work for 3 days straight and my wife was going to have to pick up that beast of a truck, which she doesn't like to drive. Instead of picking up my wife so she can drive the F250 home, Marco asked if he could have it dropped off. Not only did my truck show up at home, it was washed and parked where "I" park it! Turns out while googling my house he saw a picture of my truck and parked it there. I got home Sunday morning, and inspected my road princess and was very impressed at the work and the wash job. I highly suggest anyone who loves their vehicle to go to Siender's Collision. they are outstanding.
Thanks Marco and your team. I will be seeing you again!<//text>

If you are looking for a collision center this is the place to go to.  I went there because I knew someone who worked there, but he got laid off due to the pandemic.  I got kind of skeptical taking my car there because he was laid off. Qui assured me that Seidners will do a great job.  He was right.  I hope the company hires him back. Thank you Qui,
Besides all that.  I am very very very pleased that I took my car there.   I had an incidents years back when we had those great winds, and a tree fell on my car. Took it to a different place and boy oh boy how unhappy I was, no wonder they are out of business.
Go to Seidners Collision Center you will be very satisfied.<//Review>

Absolutely a first-class operation from the minute you walk in the door, greeted and helped by a very professional, friendly staff and our estimator, service rep David was amazing from start to finish.  He kept us updated ...estimate was right on..... and the work was finish way ahead of schedule.
AND the quality of the workmanship is second to none.  When we picked up the car, it looked like it was right off the showroom floor.  Thanks to all the pros at Seidner Collision Repair/Duarte.  Highly recommend.<//review><user>116643140032085409224</user>< pics>

Absolutely the best body shop in the San Gabriel foothill area. The staff at the front desk friendly and welcoming. Estimators are knowledgeable and patient with explaining the process. Super clean bodywork and paint in a timely fashion. I highly recommend Seidners.<//text>

Date of loss 12/30/19

Car gets dropped off on 12/31/19

I signed up for text updates and have received NO texts whatsoever.

I call on 1/9/20 they said it would be done 1/10/20, it was getting a detail and polish. I also have an email from Seidner’s saying that the vehicle took 7 days to repair, and that the vehicle out date was 1/10/20.

I call on the 10th and they say it’s not painted, assembled, or aligned yet, it’ll be done 1/14/20.

I call on the 14th and they said they had a call out, it’ll be done on the 15th, just needs to be assembled.

I call today and they said they JUST got the parts in and will be ready on the 16th.

Why so many different stories? On top of that,
every manager has been avoiding my phone calls and voicemails, so I use another phone to reach them and that’s when they answer.

Still haven’t received any text updates or any callbacks. This is my 6th and LAST time coming to Seidner’s for a repair.<//Text>

<Review>Seidners has worked  on my car twice ,both times after people have backed into my car in the front and the passenger rear door . My biggest concern has always been the paint matching both times they done a great job , my color is alpine white on a BMW they left my car looking like nothing ever happened , after doing a great job on my car twice . I would highly recommend then to anybody that wants their car done right after a accident .After going through the hassle of a car accident at least getting your car done right looking brand new is all you can ask for.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Nick told me he wasn't sure how long it would take but would keep me informed as I went back to work. Got an email that they could get the part that day, finished work, and had my repair finished right after. Nick was very courteous and friendly during the whole process!</review>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><pics>None</pics><text>at Jan 2013 I had a read end collision on my BMW X5 and AAA recommend me go to Seidner ar Duarte, After I go and I find out surprisingly friendly staff. Special my services agent Kenny Martinez. he take care my car very well and return to me 3 days early then promised date ( estimate 4 days he give it back to me after 1 day), also I mention I need small headlight bright up services on my wife's car, he did right away for free. and I was shock. and also 1 week later I had little scratch on bumper the reflector drop to the inside of the bumper, he also did it for me for free.

I can't believe what a wonderful experience I have been through and recommend Seider collision to everyone I know<//text><name>David Sun</name>< Time>

{'time': 1573603700734, 'text': 'We appreciate you coming by to give us the opportunity to repair your 2008 Ford Mustang. The cost we estimated was to remove/reinstall your bumper, repair the damage, repaint the bumper along with installing the stripe on it as well. That also included doing a paint less dent repair on the right quarter panel as well. Our price is very fair for the quality of repairs we perform, paint products used and warranty we issue on those repairs. If you visit any quality auto body shop in the area our price will be competitive with their estimates. Any body shop painting a vehicle for $600 is not using quality warrantied paint materials, using proper painting methods, or following all prepping procedures to ensure the paint adheres and lasts on the vehicle as it should. Yes we are not the cheapest out there but we deliver manufacture certified repairs that over 25 auto dealerships trust along with numerous major insurance companies including Auto Club, State Farm, Allstate and Mercury insurance to name a few.'}< /Response>

{'time': 1534950865445, 'text': 'Cleiton, We appreciate you coming by for an estimate for your Scion. Our estimate for under 1K was to completely replace your rear bumper with a new one and paint the bumper to match your vehicle. Our service adviser recommended replacement vs repair and gave you lower labor rates then we charge insurance companies. Our repair costs may not always be the cheapest out there but we perform quality repairs performed by certified technicians and we issue our valued lifetime warranty with every repair we perform. There is always going to be shops out there that cut corners to save money but that is not us and we accept no shortcuts and do what is best for your vehicle. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to repair your vehicle and wish you the best with your repairs.'}<//Resp>

<text>Awesome customer service Karina great job. Checked for deals, had a hard to find item, put everything on my phone for me and got me out the door in 15 minutes .. Small location on the corner off Florida in a small Plaza across from Walgreens on one side. A Shell gas station in the other side. Worth the stop!</text>< pics>

Awesome customer service Karina great job. Checked for deals, had a hard to find item, put everything on my phone for me and got me out the door in 15 minutes .. Small location on the corner off Florida in a small Plaza across from Walgreens on one side. A Shell gas station in the other side. Worth the stop!<//Review>

I love coming here. The employees are always so friendly and I have to say that Henry really knows what he is doing and he makes you feel right at home and he is not afraid to take his time and show you the selection of products that he personally recommends to his customers.   And I love that they have MULTIPLE SECURITY GUARDS surrounding the area especially being a girl and wanting to pick up at night  I feel so safe.< /Review>

< review>
Too expensive, too much variety and leaves consumers confused on what to get (too much of a good thing can be bad if not categorized properly), and terrible customer service from a "Vanessa". The terrible bud tender was a bit off putting with her customer service and her hickey marks. Don't go here its just like the other expensive spots like Medmens. Strongly suggest looking for other spots. Best of luck.< /review>

<text>First timer here.

Starting off with parking and the outside, there is a security guard who will direct you into the store. I went in when there was no line, but each person is socially distanced! Parking was very easy and there was plenty of space right outside the shop.

Upon entering, you are safely greeted and directed to a server. Victor knew exactly what kind of customer I was when I told him that I was looking for edibles. He took his time to show me his personal favorites and the most popular selections and guided me on what kind of edibles I would want to go with. Amazing service and great deals! Definitely coming back again!

Make sure you learn about any in-store deals! There's a buy 2 get 1 deal that I didn't know of, but now I do! :)< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><username>Ethan Dang</username><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80c2c5a6b937e415:0x92e00f75426d3c07< /gmapID><userid>109516872923861892273< /userid><response>None< /response><time>1607644627228</time></record></dataset><record>

<text>The security and staff were all incredible.  Quick process and generous deal for first time visitors.  Bummer was that I didn't end up buying what I had ordered.  I thought I was purchasing a bottle of Rebel Coast with 40mg total THC.  Turns out, the site was incorrectly labeled, and I reluctantly agreed on a small can for the advertised price.  I'll most likely give them another shot, but will approach with earned skepticism.< /text><date>1604817583313<//date>< user_name>

< review>
I purchased  two Top Shelf Eighths that were  $30-$40 for each and 1 full g for a stizzy pod and it came out to “$154” with 10% discount. Very unsatisfied!! My first purchase was PR strains and I had gotten a lot more goodies for about the same price. Sadly, Only been here twice but definitely never again and will stick to the High Note shop right down the street from them.  I’d rate 0 stars at this point!!!<//review>

<text>Nice dispensary.

First time going here. I figured I'd go here cause the local ones were out of stock of the good products.  At LA kush I was sold a defective product... I drove 45 mins there and back to have to go back smh. The second lady who help me after I was sold a defective product  looked like she hated to be there and had an attitude and also took forever...
I wasn't offered anything small to compensate for the 2+ hr drive for a defective product and a bud tender with an attitude.

I'll stick with my near by dispensary cause at least they'll give you a free joint, edible, or a next time off deal for mistakes or incorrect products and ensure great customer service.</text><username>Rere< /username><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1609552433296<//Date></record></dataset><record>

I've been going here for years and I have to say they always comes through with fire. I'm not really much for prepackaged flowers but the service is usually on point and there's plenty of variety to choose from. They've become a little pricy in the last couple of years so make sure to go during happy hour. Also, they have designated days for certain item specials, check em out. Dope spot 💯< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>My first time there, horrible never going back Wrong order. I arrived to the budtender and showed a picture of watermelon resin concentrate I was interested in purchasing. Was charged for watermelon sativa flower, which I didnt get to see as I was handed a bag already stapled. I return to my car and there I notice the wrong order, so I returned with my items purchased. I explain the situation and inform the tender about the wrong order as well as the flower was still being sealed and untouched. She headed to the back for a second to talk with a manager I assume and came back to notify me they won't be able to refund or exchange which they didn't come out to talk to me. I personally hate sativa. The flower wasnt good at all for my taste. Waste of money and time for my first experience on 7/17< /review>< pictures>

A huge name on the cannabis scene in LA. This shop hosts all various types, forms and flavours of cannabis. All great prices. There is an ATM inside even though the shop accepts payment by card. The staff are very helpful and friendly and there are some great deals. My suggestion would be to try the gummie edibles!< /review>

<text>I live in St. Louis, this is my 2nd trip out here this year, I visited in April and had a great experience, so much I drive 45min back here today, when I try not to visit a dispensary twice. My visit started out great, the front desk worker was fantastic, but when I was given to Benjamin I became an annoyance. Constantly repeating questions because he was paying attention to anything but me, no helpful suggestions, no deals apparently even though I get s text about them daily. I still made a purchase out of respect that owner still has good products. I don’t know if I’ll be back. Saddening. 😕<//text><GmapID>0x80c2c5a6b937e415:0x92e00f75426d3c07</GmapID><name>Chad Green< /name><userid>114171531053561214672<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Regular local customer. Second time ive come before posted closing time and you close at 9:45. If you close early post the time correctly. Never coming back. Your prices are too high anyway. Posted times mean the actual time you can walk through the door! You do not deserve my business. Wonderland LA everyone wayy cheaper quicker easier and better weed.< /review>

Loving the change LA Kush has done recently. Been a patient for years and they are always consistent with the high quality buds and great customer service. Now they have become recreational and it is great that I can bring all my friends who where too scared to give weed a try. Highly recommend this place and brand to anyone who loves the best of the best!!<//review>

As a first time dispensary goer, this place was clean and professional yet easy going. There was also a vendor stationed in front of the line greeting everyone.

Maybe I had the unlucky draw, but my budtender was pedestrian in her helpful-ness, especially since it was my first time at a dispensary, and getting anything.

She only asked simple questions, without going into detail with her answers. There were no instructions on the battery, and had to fidget with it to recognize the functions. I learned the percentages on the cartridges after personal research. Etc.

At the end I just grabbed her recommended stuff:
CRU battery
Ocean Co. Blue Dream .5mg cartridge

Albeit I don't really have much to gauge the quality of the products, I did enjoy them.< /review>

< Review>
Been here a couple times, just moved from colorado. Was looking for a legitimate, trustworthy, and respectful company to buy from. Every time i walk in i’m greeted with attitude by the girls. Today though i walked in to make a purchase after purchasing multiple times via apple pay, and was told that the person was not there to accept my payment. i went outside and called , asking if they accepted apple pay , and that i was driving from 45 mins away. i was told yes, walked back in, and was given the same answer with the same attitude. The payment isn’t square cash, so everyone should be trained to use the POS system if it is advertised as a service that is provided to me. also, the product sold here does not live up to how it was perceived. i was not happy with the product but i thought that the store had a great potential and i wanted to make it my main supplier since i’m new here , but i will for sure be taking my business elsewhere. 09/13/19 8:30pm< /Review>

<Review>I'm going to give a good review because i like the brand. But I've been smoking their redbox for a while now. I live on the westside so I get it from the store around there that carry them. Lately they've been sold out so I went to this store. The bud was not what I was used to. It smelled more like a sativa. Not sure if that's just a regular thing at this store only but it was a bummer.< /Review>< Pics>

I showed up for the edipure special at 11, I was informed by the budtender that it didn’t start til 12, of course this was my mistake. After being informed that it was from 12-4, I decided to leave and come back at 12. After coming back at 12, a different employee informed me that the time on the flyer that was advertised was wrong, that it wasn’t from 12-4, it was from 4 pm and on. I asked if they could still honor it seeing as it was their  mistake for the wrong time, they said no. Needless to say that I walked out a very frustrated and disappointed patient. This was always my go to place but definitely didn’t feel like they did what they could to help a patient out.<//Review>< Time>

Best strains in my opinion is anything that comes in the la kush fancy box. The red box is easily my favorite and it’s their newest strain. They have daily deals and then sometimes super crazy deals like at least once a month. They honestly revoluntized the marijuana industry, and no other shop can compare.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
The Gold standard of shops in LA. They set the bar consistently with the highest quality of meds matched with the highest quality of service.

It starts with an entrance that is professional and welcoming, comfortable seats and an interesting video always playing. Not that you will have to wait long or at all. They know how to keep it moving.

Security that doesnt look like a mall-cop with a gun. I know when I shop here that I wont end up in an incident on the news. They are both capable and professional.

Bud-tenders have genuine recommendations not just generic comments pushing what the spot is trying to move. They also keep me informed of specials and offers without shoving them down my throat.

It all comes together and makes you want to come back for more. Especially if you go to another spot and realize whats missing.<//review>

I've been a patient with LA Kush for more than a year now.  This is the only place I actually became a reoccurring patient due to the fact they had everything I wanted in one place.  The budtenders are all very helpful and respectful.  I did experience a budtenders being sassy with me during one visit but that did not stop me from coming back.  I'm proud to hear they are now recreational and it shows me they are legit due to the fact they follow rules and regulations.  Thank you for your excellent service!<//Review>

< Review>
Los Angeles Kush is definitely one of the best out there. They are a bit on the pricey side but what you get is always top quality. Recently with the new laws they have a shortage of goods so please bare with them on that. The staff here always so nice and pleased to help you find exactly what you are looking for. As for the security they always make the place feel safe for everyone. Great convienant location except on school days when there can be tons of traffic. Hope this helps those planning on visiting. Thanks LAK always remember NO SEAL NO DEAL!< /Review>

<Text>Have been visiting this dispensary since CHR days and I remember them always having good deals on all their products just hope that continues. It’s a very convenient location to those in East LA or SGV right off the 710 and they just added a new parking lot to accommodate parking needs. Not much product to choose from right now so might take some time for shelves to stock up. Overall it’s a good place to check out.<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

Possible the worst experiences possible, have been to multiple LA shop this is the first that would not accept an AZ Id, service was not good also my freind they did let in was  promised a first time discount that was also refused by the manager here we came to spend money here not just a couple dollars but atleast 500$-1000$ we will not be disrespected and expect for us to come back, fyi TLC had better flower and better pricing for the ounce and also let me in on my az id< /review>

< Review>
Took down my other review so I’ll do it again. Yesterday, on 4/20, this dispensary took 45 minutes longer to open than they advertised.

Prices are constantly advertised differently than you pay. The flower you look at at the counter is the very best of the batch. The sealed container you aren’t allowed to open on our outside the premise is just sticks and stems with some flower desperately holding on.

Why on earth are you hiring security guards that want to pretend they are in a combat zone and flash punisher and blue lives matter patches? When you trigger the PTSD of a patient, you aren’t doing it right.

Profits first institution. Cannabis ... welcome to Pharma where the prices are made up and the patients don’t matter.<//Review>

Can't go wrong when you go to LA Kush. Award winning quality meds that makes you want to come back for more. Been going to many shops over the years and nobody beats the quality of LA Kush. HIGHLY recommend them too anybody.<//Review>

I use to come here when it was CHR.  I know a lot has changed since the passing of the new laws however as as consumer I should not be denied my right to receive what's intended to be purchased.  There's no excuse for the grade/quality of what I received from this store.   Needless to say, just another loss.  I went back to see if I could exchange or get a refund my purchase OR at least have a discount on my next one!  That was a no go!  The Budtender who helped me Manager Damen didn't seem interested that I had an issue with my purchase.  Okay cool.  Won't be back</text>

<Response>{'time': 1543346242673, 'text': 'Hello D Col. We truly apologize. We have tried our best to reach out but it seems like we have unfortunately fell short. We tried our best to advise patients it was medical only. If you receive the past text deals you will see that it states "MEDICAL ONLY". We also have been trying to spread the word through our social media platforms. We greatly appreciate your support thus far and really hope to be able to make it up to you and all our other recreational patients. We do plan to host the same deal once we are able to be open to the public. We hope you give us another chance, Thank you! We ask for you to please follow us on social media to stay updated or email as at info@lakush.com before taking the trip if you do decide to give us another chance. We aspire to be able to take care of you in the future! Thank you IG: LAKUSH.valleyblvd Snap Chat: Lakcollective1 Twitter: lakcollective1 Email: info@lakush.com'}</Response>< Text>
No longer accepting recreational. They have a text messaging system to notify all their patients for great deals, but they didn't use that to inform their recreational customers that the store is only Medical.< /Text>

I was greeted by front desk and then sent to these very nice guards which then sent me to a budtender. The budtender was very knowledgeable (which is very important) and willing to help me out! I got the Los Angeles kush " Red Box and LA kookies " and it was two of the best strains I've had in a long time. They both got me super high and took away my pain. This is a shop u MUST CHECK OUT. Great quality meds, and wonderful customer service here.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c5a6b937e415:0x92e00f75426d3c07< /GmapID></record>

Love La Kush. Just started vaping more and I always choose the Lak brand. My favorite one is the purple tangie. Pretty stoney but allow me to go on with my day as planned. Love the lak preroll joints. the half grams have been my go to when I want to smoke in a giffy. I live in Los Angeles and do not mind driving to LAK.<//review>

<Text>My favorite spot in LA.  The girls are always personable, professional, and knowledgable.  They always take their time and make sure that you are satisfied. The herb is delicious! And although I personally am not a fan of edibles, they have a rice crispy treat that is really yummy! Make sure to go during "Happy Hour" so to take advantage of their $10/gram topshelf.  Parking can sometimes be challenging, but the turn over rate is pretty fast (they keep a full staff).  So just be patient.  It will be worth your wait.</Text>< GmapID>

LAK is one of the most stoner friendly shops in all of LA. Amazing selection of vapes and fire flower, a must stop if you’re in the area! LAK running the game by far 🤙🏽💯💯<//text>

I normally don’t leave reviews but this collective is doing such an awesome job!!! I had to tell as many people about this place as I can!!! So for starters they were an exclusive club only treating prop 215 patients, which to outsiders who couldn’t get in this was a problem but to us elite members. We were exclusive and had exclusive deals. For example, top shelf 1/8ths for $35 or even $40 5 gram specials and not some mid or low shelf 5grams. I mean a real hook up for your $40 bucks and a dank, crystal, covered flower for the low.
Now here it is mid summer and my favorite collective has opened to the public by going recreational. I knew this was inevitably because my very knowledgeable budtenders at LAK have been informing me of the change well before it was implemented. I’m gonna be honest I wasn’t happy to see my top shelf 1/8ths no longer available. But one thing I can
say about this collective is that the quality has not gone anywhere. And they even brought back there 5 gram specials some are even $30.
Most collectives  don’t care about the quality of there product they mostly just want to make all the cash they can. Los Angeles Kush does more than put amazing products out, they care about there patients and what it is important to them as well. Good meds at great prices!!! Thanks LAK for doing what y’all do!!! I will definitely be a repeat customer!!!< /text>

We try really hard to serve our patients and customers with the products they wish to see at our shop, with that being said alot of the brands that we have are going to be a bit pricier but we do sell that at a cheaper cost in comparison to other legal shops around. Also with that being said, we do sell more affordable products as well as try to have specials to accommodate every customers budget. If you have any further questions or concerns or if you have suggestions as to brands you would wish for us to carry you may email us at info@lakush.com. We are open to hearing what our patients and customers have to say. Thank you.'}<//resp>< Date>

<Text>They suck now. They got lazy. Prices are not good anymore. They think they're better than they really are. I'm taking my business elsewhere.

**************
Pros: good selection (flowers, concentrates, edibles, drinks, pills, topicals), good prices, deals most every day.

Cons: unless you're a guy or into kissing a $$ the girls (budtenders) can be kinda full of themselves and pretentious, also un-knowledgeable when it comes to breaking down orders and weighing it out properly. Depends on who you get. Also parking can be difficult.</Text>< Resp>

<text>My favorite collective in ALL of SOCal! I am originally from the Bay Area, where we ALL know the bomb meds come from. So it is safe to say my standards when it comes to my meds are rather high. I referred a buddy here recently who has a sleeping disorder and chronic pain, he got PR grams for $10 a gram!! talk about steal!!!! Their private reserve strains are straight fireeee, incomparable to any other place hands down!

The budtenders are knowledgable, friendly, and most of all PATIENT. Vast selection of all things meds!! c'mon they even have inhalers here!<//text>< pictures>
