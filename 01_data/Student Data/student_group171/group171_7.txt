This is my third time taking my car to Caliber Collision, I used to take it to this location when it was formally known as Love Lady's, and Caliber stands up to the same excellent quality of work. I will definitely recommend Caliber Collision to all my friends and family.<//Text>

<Text>Overall experience was great. Repair was done in a timely manner, quick and proficient. Service could do a little better. I felt the rep, Cynthia was so so, there was a point where I sat and waited for her to help me and another customer came in the shop. She told that customer he’d have to wait as “that guy” was ahead of him. That guy being me, I’m a little old school I feel in a business setting you should refer to the client as such or by customer. Also felt rep kept referring me back to my insurance with any repairs done outside of their ability to fix. I’ve taken another vehicle to a caliber Collision and they fixed everything without incident. Guess it varies shop to shop.< /Text><Rate>4<//Rate><resp>{'time': 1603229594446, 'text': "Hi Jon, thank you for your wonderful review!

<Text>Ariana, Cynthia and Miguel were awesome in the office, and the team did a GREAT job on my front end AND back end of my Kia. Paint job is ON POINT, everything looks in excellent condition inside and out. Done on time, communication was EXCELLENT and they stayed on top of the insurance portion so it was hassle free for me to pick up my car also. Definitely recommend them and would definitely go back!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1601324228730, 'text': "Hi Amber, thank you for your wonderful review!

I have Safeco insurance and they advised me to take my car to Caliber Collision. The estimator who helped me was very knowledgeable and took his time to explain the whole process to me from start to finish. Thank you Cesar Marquez! I am keeping their business card for any future car repairs I may need down the road...

Special thanks to the front office staff for being kind and welcoming. I would recommend this shop to my friends and family.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><review>To say that I was not looking forward to getting my car fixed is an understatement however Caliber Collision made the process so easy. Everyone was so helpful throughout the process and my car looked great after. I hope I don't ever have to go through this again, but if I do I will definitely be coming back to this shop.  Thanks to all the staff for making this situation less stressful.</review>< user_id>

<text>Excellent food, and great service.   You have never really tasted fried chicken until you have tried the Chicken 65 appetizer, the paper dosa is always a crowd pleaser and the Roti Paratta bread is made from scratch like you have never had before.   Great place for someone new to South Indian food and for the most discerning Indian food  connoisseur alike.   Definitely going back.< /text>< user_id>

<Review>Food quantity has reduced to half !! Yes half.
The flavors have reduced and changed ! So the dishes you loved, aren't the same.
Been ordering food all thru the pandemic and years before that too.
Meat dishes had half or more bones than meat...also read above... quantities decreased by half!

Loved their food but now oh well. Sad!!< /Review>< pictures>

we did a pick up today thru uber eats around 9pm or so , we had a food poisoning within 2 hours ...!!
it was the only food we ate during the day , we  are couple we had the same  skin rush from legs to arms and face , both of us , diarrhea until now 2:30 AM !
we already complained that to uber eats ( hopefully they will investigate ) usually i do never complain about food .. but this is beyond complain.. !
The chicken smells really bad , the rice kinda reheated,  soupe as well , sauces look weird.. !
its so sad we loved indian food , we are going to see a doctor tomorrow,  and if it will be  serious we will sue this restaurant !
YOU CANNOT  IGNORE THE FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS ! KIDS CAN DIE FROM THAT ... !!
Finally , BE AWAAAAAARE !!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE !< /Review>

<user_name>Beat China< /user_name><Text>I am local and was regular customer.
I brought my friends and family here to eat.
This place is going bad.
Food quality and quantity are at the worst state as of today.
Mutton biryani with pieces of bones.
Chicken curry unpalatable.
5 partners in this place focussed on money, not on the business.
Too many partners spoiling the Anjappar name.
Hope they close and move on.<//Text>< Response>

< Review>
Chicken 65 biryani:
Ohhh my gosh. This is good! The chicken is thoroughly coated and soaked with herbs and spices that there's a red color even inside. It's not crispy but there is a very very thin coat of breading. I wish there were more. The yogurt sauce is refreshing. The gravy is pretty tasty too and adds more depth to your bite; like a concentrated version of the biryani flavor but with maybe some chicken stock? I'm not sure.</Review>

<Text>If you are ordering Biryani, eat there. When they run out of Biryani, they sell regular fried rice with fried chicken as chicken 65 biryani. It's remotely not the same. We've requested them on multiple occasions for the proper Biryani, but they just flat out lie....and lo and behold, we are surprised when we get home.<//Text>< Pics>

<username>Justine Langston<//username><user>116251146844879855772</user><Text>It looked like these folks were having a bit of a rough night when I went to pick up my order-- they seemed understaffed.  However, my order was ready on time, and once I brought it home turned out to be perfect and delicious! Best Mysore Masala Dosa I've had in a long time (which I was suspicious of ordering to-go but was just fine if not super crispy), great dhal fry and I was very happy with the eggplant and tamarind dish which I'd never tried before.  I spent quite a bit of time in southern Indian, and though I was not familiar with chettinad cuisine specifically, this definitely hits the spot for other classics.  I will certainly return to try a few more dishes, I hope they stay busy so that they can perhaps hire a bit more help.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>Key takeaways:

Unprofessional staff.
Horrible amenities.
Bad Service.
Substandard Taste.
Ill-managed.

Please do not compromise with substandard and  unprofessional restaurants.

Full explanation:

Upon entry I could notice lack of proper ventilation in the restaurant. You can smell the kitchen smell as well as restroom odor. The menu of the restaurant is confusing.Even the service person/cashier was confused. Upon successfully ordering the food( 3dishes ) we waited for around 30 mins and only 1 dish arrived(idli) even though only 3 tables were seated in the full restaurant. Then came the other dish(noodles). The cashier/waiter/service-person forgot the 3rd dish(sambhar idli with chutney on the side). We asked for the third dish and it was discovered that they forgot about it. After sorting the confusion, we asked to get it and waited for 20 more mins as they didn't write the order and told the staff verbally. Upon the delivery of the third dish by the original person who took our order, he commented that "good luck eating the chutney as you have ordered a sambhar idli dip and I have never seen anyone eat it like that". I felt it to be unnecessary, unethical and rude of him to make such a comment. I didn't feel the need to stoop to his level and respond to his lewd comment at that time. The food had sub-standard taste. I would like to mention that I got to eat better idli and chutney when I went to Malibu Hindu temple canteen.

It's shameful that they can't even produce decent quality south-indian staple food like idli and sambhar.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdb6c7d30e34d:0x12b831338058047a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had a very bad experience. I ordered veg kurama, and it was just water. There were hardly a few pieces of veggies. Couldn’t even eat 2 chapatis with the curry. More than half of the box was just watery gravy. Chapatis were very hard and chewy. This was the worst experience I have had after spending a lot of money.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>One of the best place I the town  to enjoy authentic food of southern part of India .

<review>Last Sunday we went all the way from San Diego, ordered 4 dishes one mutton biryani, one chicken biryani, one chicken thali and one mutton thali.
None of them were good.
They cheated with thalis, in the menu they mentioned fish gravy in both thalis, but they didn't give fish gravy in any of the thalis. when I call them they realised that they didn't give fish gravy, but they charged for that dish. Then they said they refund the money for thalis, but they did not refund and charged full amount. I am going to dispute the bill with my credit card company.
The chicken biryani also made with old stock basmathi rice and mutton biryani was just like palav with sticky rice. None of them taste good. I was so disappointed.
Please beware of this restaurant, do not confuse with Anjappar name
The original Anjappar restaurant located at 18128 Pioneer Blvd, Artesia, you will get the authentic Indian food there.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>3.5 stars. The food is good! I'm giving this 3.5 stars due to the service - the whole place was empty but they wanted to seat us one table away from another occupied table (we promptly moved several tables away) and the service was a little slow even though the in-dining was not too busy.

We ordered the tomato soup and a ghee podi dosai to share. The tomato soup was soothing to my soul.  I've gotten away from having it as frequently since I moved to the United States so this was a good change and brought back memories from home. Good garlic kick with a hint of spicy. Liked it.

The ghee podi dosai was good too. Pretty big for one person, the chutney inside the dosai was spicy as expected. The chutneys accompanying the dosai were good. The sambar was ok.

We don't live in the area but if we come back, will consider take out.<//Review>< Pics>

Went there for dinner and offered virundhu thali. One of the best I’ve had. Spices were rightly balanced in all the dishes. Quality of food was just amazing.

Much desired 5 star rating.</Text>

We ordered like 6 to 7 items for whole group and they messed up our order. Raita was so watery, no cud taste in it.Biryani had very few chicken and even paneer biryani had very few paneer pieces. Naan was "naan" breakable, it was very rubbery could not tear it with one hand. I have had much better Indian food.

I want to give zero. Drove one and half hours to eat at this place, in which eventually they missed our order, managed to serve bad food. When we called the management to ask about our messed order, the lady said please call to sort it out tomorrow.<//Review>

Quality has gone down. Ordered chicken tikka and mutton biryani. Chicken was raw in the middle and burnt on the outside. Mutton biryani felt like old. Raita was very sour as if few days old. Horrible experience this time.<//Text>

Worth a wait for months, they have started with limited menu options. I have been there twice, tried their mutton biryani, chicken fry. Food was yummy and fulfilling. I didn't like their chicken biryani, just a mix of spices not cooked well, feedback well received by staff and they are working on improving the food quality,  need to try again with their full menu< /Review>

This place is absolutely amazing! Came here late at night on a whim, and didn’t really know what to order, and Nithya was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. The food was super super good, and was ready quickly as well. 100% recommend.</Review>

I have been to this Anjappar restaurant for the past 8 months. Today is my birthday I ordered their signature dish Chettinad fish curry, Anjappar special chicken gravy and parotta. As usual all food taste very good. Suddenly the staffs working there surprised us with a dessert. I was so happy today. Thanks for the surprise.< /Text>

Order thalis and parata

Very poor packing - curries came in very delicate boxes and they leaked though we carried them carefully.
Chicken and fish thalis had only one item of that and rest all were vegetarian gravies and rasams. Hardly figured out what that item was.

Paratas was very thick and uncooked in the corners. It was just like eating batter.
The curry which came with parata had two pieces of chicken which hardly had any meat.

Not recommended 👎🏻</review>

When in OC and craving for Chettinad food, then Anjappar is the place to head to without a second thought. Until last year, the only Anjappar in the vicinity was about an hour's drive away in Artesia, so visiting the place occurred once-in-a-blue-moon. But ever since they opened a branch in nearby Tustin, our visits to the nearest Anjappar have become way more frequent - be it to dine in or to pickup some spicy grub!

The ambience is lively and the interior decor is very pretty, especially the mural of a peacock. There are quite a few tables that are decently spread out, but you might have to wait for a while to get seated if you show up during their peak hours. That said, their service is prompt and the staff are quite cheerful and friendly.

Though it's hard to go wrong with the food selection here, there are quite a few options to choose from and it's easy to get lost in the menu. When visiting with friends during lunch hours, we usually order their Virundhu thaali (translates to feast) which has a plethora of food items that are more than enough for two people with a good apetite! Recently we went for dinner and sought help in deciding which a la carte items to order. Nithya kindly recommended the Egg Curry to go with the Idiyappam combo and Appam combo, and had us sold on the Vavval Varuval (Pomfret Fish Fry), and each of these items was delish! We ordered the Mutton Biryani with Seeraga Samba Rice and Nattukkoli Masala (Country Chicken Curry) to go, and enjoyed the food over the next couple of days (amazing how already tasty food becomes yummier and spicier after a day or two!). What better way to top off a hearty and spicy meal than the Desi way of having a Sweet Paan (an assortment of ingredients wrapped together in a Betel leaf)! Burp!

Never have I walked away from Anjappar feeling disappointed in any way. I sure hope they keep up the great work!< /Text>

<Review>Pretty good food.  Ambiance is very nice and the restaurant was clean and modern.  It looks pricey, but the prices were reasonable as the portions were huge.  They have a huge hall with many tables although, when we went, it was mostly empty.  The food was good.  The crab masala was delicious but super messy as a whole crab comes out.  The mutton biryani and the thali were also decent.  That said, the service could be better.</Review>< user_id>

The BEST chettinad food prepared with great quality and from the taste we can easily find out the freshness and quality of spices used for preparing these delicious dishes. Falooda, Mutton Biriyani, Kuli Paniyaaram, Chicken 65, Ceylon Parotta, Chicken Lollypop are my all time favorites..😊

We had the appe/ paniyaram, saambar idli and appam with egg curry! Everything was spot on (not too spicy, not bland at all).

Abundant parking outside and easy access/ entrance. There're also restrooms inside.
Only feedback would be the service takes a tiny bit long, but the food more than makes up for the wait!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZjA6Nl_xSjEa8i6ucZw__jhhy8yjV1YE-KF7p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuAQHveFeu-Op7h_SLJMJ_ecrlPzNZb3Pjbr-E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4K6lUaC2RKajom1qLQ0MW_Q9kWl_FLaf7-IMM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dcdb6c7d30e34d:0x12b831338058047a</gmapID></record>

<Response>None<//Response><text>Being a South Indian and an Anjappar  fan I had high expectations. As soon as I stepped into the restaurant I was welcomed by the magnificent urban setting, a beautiful combination of Indian culture and an immense luxury of modernity by their wall art of peacock that was spectacular and astounding. And about their food, we ordered vegetarian meals it was packed with typical South Indian flavors for your taste buds. For their price, I felt the quantity was huge when compared to other Anjappar I had earlier. I really appreciate their customer service and efforts taken even in small details like plating and serving utensils. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with my friends and their delicious food. I would highly recommend this place. They never disappoint you with the typical anjappar flavor. This place is perfect combo for the most delicious food while admiring the beautiful paintings there.</text><UserId.>107264221108224285807< /UserId.><user_name>Rekhaa Ragav< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

A really wide Indian food variety, more than any other restaurants I have come across in Orange county. This place represents more of the south part of India but plenty of choices. Every food is a must try, especially their chicken. Even the drinks are good. Their parotta is delectable.< /Text>

During the quarantine and even before I've been a big fan of doing takeout for Indian food but having this for the first time tonight changed my life! definitely worth the price for a romantic Indian dinner for two (at home) If you want the impact of real flavor and not the basic everyday mass made buffets, I'd recommend this place everytime!<//Review>

<Text>First let me start with food quantities, me and my friends were sorely disappointed. We spent 100$ and the turnout is pretty cringe worthy. Taste is below average. I liked the chk lollipops we ordered. Mutton masala has 1 mutton piece thats it. Chicken Biryani is bad. Tasted like colored rice with chk pieces in it. Special Anjappar chicken fry is not at all good. Bad balance of spices. Chicken curry is ok. But A group of 5 people had trouble completing it.

This is most def not like Anjappar in Anaheim. Not even close. Dont waste your hard earned money with this cuz thats how i felt. Try something else please.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>In an unassuming strip mall in Tustin lies Anjappar, an equally unassuming Indian restaurant serving South Indian cuisine. The restaurant itself is modern, bright with high ceilings and interesting wall art. The food is flavorful and the service pretty good. I had the mutton thali and it was delicious and reasonably priced. Will definitely return to try more food!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The food for the most part was good.   Avoid the garlic nan as it was dry and seemed to be made with poor quality flour.  Also the rice was dry and was breaking into pieces.  The service was very very poor.  Neither the manager nor the staff were trained.  We waited a long time for our order to be taken.  Then my wife's food came out, my food came out a full 10 minutes after my wife's and my daughter's food came out about 5 minutes after mine and only after we inquired about her dinner.  A kitchen staff member even came out with my daughter's dinner and took it to the wrong table and then back to the kitchen before finally bringing it to our table.  Also they gave my wife a Samber portion in a chutney bowl so there was not enough.  Even the waiters don't know how to pour water as they reach across guest when they could walk around the table. Also the water glasses are half the size they should be.

The manager also mumbles so you can't understand what he is saying and when he brought the bill to me (no comps even after we complained about the poor service and timing of our food), he hovered over me while I was reviewing the bill in writing in the tip.  The manager has no clue what he is doing and didn't know how to react to a proper service complaint.

This place either needs to train all its front of the kitchen employees or need to hire new people.

The food is not good enough to overcome the poor service.</Text>

Food was not good. Used to be good earlier.
The chicken in the gravy smells and mutton biryani also was not good. Bad experience with togo’s.</text>

I ordered togo from the restaurant and put the food into trash after tasting. The manchuria was burned and in black color, and the biryani taste and quality are very poor so I trashed all the food in concern of my health. Please do not order food from this place. Especially during covid19. I had few good and bad experiences with this place but not planning on going to this place any more.<//text>

The food and service is AMAZING! Definetly gotta try the Chicken65 style it is mouthwatering with just the right amount heat that it doesn't overwhelm the  flavour of it. Will be coming back again to try out more of their menu that has dishes for every one of your taste buds.<//review>

<review>We ordered delivery through Door Dash. The total bill was $80+
The food was not worth what it cost
They advertised a $21 "whole fish" dish. It was the diameter of an In N Out burger and about 1/4 inch thick. I will never order from this place again.</review>< Rate>

<Review>Today myself and my friends went to Anjappar Restaurant, Orange County. We ordered Chicken Thali and Mutton Biryani. The food is soo good. The mutton pieces are so tender and all the items in thali is soo good. The service is awesome and we got everything on time. I have been to many Indian restaurant but this is one of the best. People who wants to have a nice authentic food can go to this restaurant. This is highly recommended.<//Review>< pics>

Simply Worst customer service ever ar Anjappar, Newport Beach.. .*pls don't mind the distance and go to the nearby anjappar, artesia, long beach*.. here the food was ok.. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE is the least way to say.. POOR COMMUNICATION with the customers and with the ppl working there.. they were keep bringing wrong orders.. one of the managers NITHYA she was terrible... she was sweet talking to one known customer for a long time and not giving equal attention to all customers.. we were traveling from WA and we were looking for kids menu which was unfortunately not in the menu at all.. so, we asked for just 1 idly for our little one. when giving the receipt they charged $2 for the idly.. i mean just the idly alone and not any side dish was given for that.. so, when we checked with her regarding that.. she said sambhar is $5 extra but 3 idly with side dish cost is only $6.. so when we asked her if i ordered idly(3) that would have came with sides when you charge just 1 idly it wont it come with any sides..  then she went in and one of the servers brought a spoonful of sambhar.  And  we ordered tea not knowing the kitchen is closed.. we were waiting for a while and when we asked one of the server said sorry "she - the manager Nithya cancelled the order".. meanwhile i could see she leaving in the car upfront... we didn't know that the tea order got cancelled until we checked..  we are not happy at all.. happy is second we were not even ok at all with this experience.. DON'T FALL FOR THE NAME ANJAPPAR (or every anjappar has buffet.. oh yeah, according to her(the manager) every restaurant not just anjappar who seves buffet serves only frozen meals) like us hoping all anjappar are same.. guess what, it's not.. lesson learnt.. pls drive and go to the nearby ANJAPPAR, ARTESIA, LONG BEACH.. the anjappar,artesia, long beach we went day before yesterday and we loved it there food was great and the customer service was so great as well nothing like these guys.. hopefully they change in a good way...</Text>

Huge fans of Indian food,aware of their Long waiting time, but this is horrible service out of all the restaurants in la,orange,Ventura and San Bernardino counties. For one order of veg biryani they took 2 hours, with not that much crowd and at 7:10 am, we ordered hot n sour, Manchuria and veg biryani. Soup came in 30 mins. After 30 mins Manchuria came,waited for next hour food didn’t come,left the place by cancelling the food at 8 40 pm,don’t encourage this restaurant.<//review>

<Review>One of the best Indian restaurants around this area, when you don’t have to drive to Pioneer blvd. This place is primarily a South Indian place, but they do have north Indian cuisine choices too.
Located in convenient location in Newport Ave, but parking here might get tight. Always crowded, so be prepared to wait for seating.
Friendly and fairly quick service. Neatly maintained and hygienic place, pretty safe for kids too.
We ordered following

Appetizer:
Chicken Lollipop, crispy and well cooked to perfection, not too spicy.
Chicken 65: Soft and well cooked, very flavorful.
Egg Bonda, was just ok.

Main Dish:
Chettinad Chicken: Very flavorful with lot of pepper, best part of the order is the requested spicy level is met excited.
Nattukkoli Masala: Very authentic tmailnadu recipe, perfectly churned in grinded masala, very garlic flavor induced.
We ordered Parotta, Chappathi, Naan, Aappam to go with that.
We also ordered Mutton Biriyani, no complaints. Very good flavors and rice cooked to perfection.

Beverage:
Jigarthanda, a sought-after milk-based drink, very famous in city of Madurai and across Tamilnadu. A must try, very rich drink. But please share, its too much to drink for just one.
Mango Lassi, just as expected.
Overall, very comfort, very delicious food for affordable price.
Next time, I want to try non-veg thaali.< /Review>< Pics>

We ordered the Chicken 65 as well ad Chicken Tikka Masala, and in both the dishes the chicken was very tender and fully cooked. I recommend this place to any people that are looking for a cheap, tasty, and quick service place.< /Review>< Pics>

Awesome food, waiting for the full launch on April 12th. Good food deserves some patience so please be mindful of that given it's fairly new place and they are working on improving service! 🙏<//Review>

Love the food and the service. Only reason I reduced 1 star is because we ordered coffee and after waiting for a while one guy came up and said they dont have coffee and gave us the bill and when we were leaving another guy came up with coffee to the table next and they said they never ordered coffee...
Customer service counts.< /text>

<review>Closest to authentic South Indian food, would rate as #1 restaurant in south cal. we like the pineapple kesari, coffee which is the right amount with flavor, onion fritters, love their rose milk, vadas, idli, and the sauces with them, sambar, dosa, masala papas but tell them not to over load it, veg noodles normal (schezuan, is very hot), onion uttapam, onion chili uttapam, the best is the- idli, vada, dosa, pongal, with noodle kheer, combo. Thank you for the food. On one of the busiest day they accommodated us with ease and managed to provide food on time. Kudos to exceptional management of Mr. Prakash and the servers who make the experience totally worth it.</review>< gmap_id>

Went there last night to order to go. We ordered Chettinad Chicken for $11.99 with 4 very small pieces of chicken (most are bones), also ordered Chettinad Mutton for $12.99, they only give 5 pieces of small cube meat in a small container filled with sources. Mutton Biryani is okay size. Food is very spicy.

Since we ordered to go, they purposely gave very small portions, business like this will not last very long.< /review>

If you go to this restaurant you can't have any conversations with your friends or family, the management decided to maximize the space and they kept the tables too close to each other, even if you move quickly you may hit the person siting next to you. The food takes almost 50 min to be served and it was cold. The servers have no clue on how to explain the menu. Very average food when compare to other Anjappar locations.</review>

Tried the Thali the other day.
Not worth the price. Chapati too dry, rice I sufficient, when asked if we could get a bit more rice, got to hear a short story about someone who abused it. Disappointed !!!</text>

Treated a non-Indian friend to lunch here (I am Indian); we ordered chicken 65 appetizer, masala dosa tiffin, poori with vegetable kuruma, and mushroom biryani and asked for everything to be very spicy. We planned to take home leftovers to share with our husbands later.

The chicken 65 was very tasty, and oddly enough, the most spicy, even though it was only a little spicy. The dosa was also good though the potato masala wasn't spicy. But the poori which took forever to arrive was hard, and the vegetable kuruma was so mild it tasted bland to me. These arrived after we'd finished eating so I took it home. The mushroom biryani was good but not spicy enough. I asked for pickle to spice things up,  and was told there was no pickle, and was brought a little dish of sriracha instead! It was not inexpensive so I was disappointed. So many other reviewers have described the food as too spicy so I'm wondering if I went on an off day or perhaps the consistency of food varies from day to day.<//text>

We have been here once. Loved Appam, Kotthu Paratha, and Veg Korma. Lamb/ goat curry was okay (came with bowl of rice). Didn't like Gobi 65 though - it was more of a battered and deep fried Gobi (I knew it's not the place to expect a great 65 - so had no expectations).
Will visit again to try some more dishes.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The dosa’s are just perfect, always made to perfection and the kuzhi paniyaram is to die for and the meals and the vadai’s and the mini tiffins and oh, the COFFEE is SO GOOD, definitely hits the spot. The owners are super super nice and the staff are friendly and courteous too. I love Anajappar and I would definitely give this place a 100/100.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdb6c7d30e34d:0x12b831338058047a</Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><user_name>Lalasa Prakash< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Food is closest to the real thing, service is excellent. The richness of the spices come out in a light aroma but tastes so deep you can savor home cooking in every dish. A friend ordered things for my group so I didn't get to know the names of the plates but the Mutton Dum Biryani and Crab Roast Masala stand out. The Crab Roast might be too spicy for some but if you spicy this is a must. Enjoy!</review>

< Review>
Very Friendly and Cooperative Staff with very good service rarely seen in India restaurants.

We went on Mother's day and were told of wait time of 1 hour but got a text in 25 minutes that we missed. came back to inquire after 50 minutes but without any expression that we missed the text, they accommodated us within 5 minutes.

On Mother's day, service and quality can go wrong at any restaurant and I had already resigned to this fact but surprisingly neither quality, nor the service was sub-par. Though we were told before ordering that certain dishes were not available; which is good because most of time, when you ask for a dish, then you are told of non-availability.

Imtiyaz and Shiva were excellent and the server who took and planned our order was also very nice (the same server moved from Natraj to Inchin to this place)

Food could be a bit spicy for a person who does not eat any spice were overall very balanced spices and a variety of taste to explore.< /Review>

Awesome food. Went with my friends and colleagues there for dinner. The food was great. I am a vegetarian. Naan was so soft and thin.
Panner masala was great.
Can’t wait to go back again.</Text>

<text>If you are looking for the best south India non-vegetarian food, then Anjappar is a must visit! We really loved the mutton bone soup, chicken fry, curries (chicken, mutton, fish). Vegetarians who love South Indian tiffin items should try out some of their authentic south Indian stuff (I'm not referring to idli and dosa!). Please note chettinad style of cooking is known to be spicy, so dont be surprised when the spice hits your tongue. However, you could ask for the dishes to be prepared so that it is not very spicy and the staff do oblige.
Please mention goes to the staff for making good suggestions to us in terms of price and quantity of food. We good the best food and the staff help us so that we save so money too!</text>< Pictures>

I have  to admit that I waited for quite some time to try the food at here but the wait is worth it. One of my favorites are  mutton and Chicken Briyani of course the  Mutton soup energized my appetite for the main course.  You should go enjoy it to.Authentic   Tamilnadu chettinad style cuisine. I will definitely go back again!!!</Text>

<review>Tried kothu paratha, fish fry and some gravy in first day. Kothu paratha was horrible and fish fry was raw. I love anjappar food, went with lots of expectations but really disappointed. Tried second time biryani but this time also very devastating. Will not recommend this if you really need to taste Madurai good better you become a cook for a day not worth of time and money going there< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Excellent service and delicious preparation. Chettinad is a region in Tamilnadu, India. Chettinad food is generally extremely spicy, and though I love it, my kids find traditional Chettinad food difficult to eat. At this place, the chillies have been toned down a little, but without compromising the flavor. Definitely recommend the Kashmiri Pulav (which is sweet) paired with a spicy mutton or fish dish.
Service was extremely good, staff is very friendly. Thank you Imtiyaz for opening the restaurant. No photos this time.< /Review>< Pictures>

So happy and relieved that there is no need to drive all the way to Artesia to enjoy the authentic Indian food I want now. Reason Orange County is uprising with Indian foods. The Biryanis I tasted here are heavenly for me to enjoy the taste. My personal favourites are Chicken 65 biryani and Chettinad curry. Liked to come here again to taste the FIsh. Heard Positive reviews about Fish here. Will be coming here again to taste the sea food.<//Review>

The food is good, even though the restaurant is not fully open they have a pretty good menu with variety of dishes.
The Fish curry thali was really good and the nethili fry was awesome, the taste of it was similar to what i ate in Tamilnadu.
The place has really good decor and the staff are friendly.
Overall a really good place to have lunch/dinner if ur a person who likes to eat a variety of food.</review>

Quite easily the most forgettable indian restaurant. Pathetic to say the least. I am an Indian and I would say I could have had a better meal at an In N Out. Awful idlis and awful dosas. The worst fish I have ever eaten. I would give this joint a 0 if possible.</Review>

I had tried both seeraga Sambha Biriyani & Mutton Sukka .. impressed with the Biriyani and taste .. Awesome 5star for Biriyani.. .. not so much impressed on Mutton Sukha as the meat which I got (may be that batch) is kind of rubber and not inline with what I used to have. Though the spice and curry of sukka was good .. — Adityan<//text>

It's been very long time waited for this restaurant, finally Anjappar is launched in Tustin location where i found tasty Goat biriyani with awesome Seeraga Samba rice, starters are good and yummy Rava Kesari. Finally felt home food is closer to me.</Review>

If you want to wait for more than 1 hour (after you get seated) to get the food then go there, the food is also not that great to justify the wait.</Text>

BAD customer service! The person on the counter told me that my order is going to be ready in 10 minutes. WHAT A LIE!!!! I HAD TO wait 20 minutes more.

Food is OK... Basically a regular Indian restaurant. Not impressed at all.<//Review>

<text>I have been going to A.V Retro games for years. It all started with Eyad repairing my laptop. Haven't stopped going to him since. This store is addicting as it's a nostalgic experience for me. We drive from Santa Clarita to this new location in Lancaster worth the drive. We love retro games everything from the super nintendo, Nintendo 64, to newer systems. They carry games, gaming systems, gaming merchandise to anime figurines. I trust Eyad with device repair and getting the best prices for all the items they carry. Thank you Eyad and A.V Retro employees you guys are amazing. Amazing customer service, great prices and very well organized inside.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4esUEigtue2x3yBNGhxNAIsMQFCVW3QR9x4MC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYAEiYdEtJ9fdGUROSBUAAjk9bj4fzDO-ZGiTk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORSx_NjcLDdooBgnTFMlkO-2q_zSaHYmTPAFvE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_gADu75Ace4U3PnIYLeGzRnVhNdAY5alhoNfG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcmd3reoodZhffVI1jGCYypMs0DpvIYBVM1ixE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjiAZ4OuY1PB5gQ2pOMe3NQkXvZlKuNsYEctUx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG7oVewPl7tc1TkTKu9m_0_C24j5pA2XRZVRkN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKXJGplgRIuBcEQheh2kuRazp6LOTJiyOkycRU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1puapTx0Gp_SlTnWKdnElp0tDUQNk3otoXMCe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRdu1tZd-VpcfSSwB45uvlOZytgCyBZkrBvcaC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWd1i9hOQX9jSUUGx64aXAqbLs46rNayaT5SmB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPxT-u96GP3YUXk598W3zD6-GX9VmsIqp9rwjD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBL_vkcmrJ_ehWGuwePVb5dVvVQQHizcdcqCyI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgPdfmvZtJCJ2kXSWbIf8oRgLSNySA8tJupyH1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c25ac3505674fd:0x9e7e970dc100c529<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I checked up on the progress each week now it's been almost 1 month now. 1st week he told me they needed to be tested the next week he told me they needed to be cleaned..an I came back today an he told me they needed to be tested again!! Sad to say I have to resort to find one online... thanks for continuing to disappoint a fellow gamer an wasting my time AV Retro games & computers</review>< Pics>

{'time': 1619203538160, 'text': "Hello Jay, thank you for taking the time to review AV Retro. I want to apologize for your negative experience with us. Unfortunately we have been getting alot of faulty PS2's in. The reason we informed you we have to keep testing is due to the fact all the ones that are coming in are faulty and none are good. We purchase video game consoles through online auctions and are not told whether they work or not. Please understand it is not us brushing you off, but are not able to get any good consoles at this time. We hope you give us another chance in the future. Hope you enjoy the rest of your day."}<//response>

The person who attended to us was super nice, patient, and helpful. The store had good safety measures: you have to wear a mask, there's a limited time you can be in the store, and there's a limited amount of people allowed in at once. I would definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c25ac3505674fd:0x9e7e970dc100c529<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1611679823351, 'text': 'Hello Marina, thank you for taking the time to review AV Retro. I do apologize you feel the repair cost was too high for your system. In rare instances, when parts are priced high which is out of our control or numerous repairs need to be done to one system, that can lead to a high repair cost. AV Retro has always been competitive with repair prices and is known to have the best prices in the Antelope Valley. We will also beat any brick and mortar repair price. If you find a lower price from a brick and mortar feel free to bring it in and I would be more than willing to price match it. Thank you for coming in and I hope you have a great day.'}< /response>

This place is absolutely amazing. Friendly atmosphere and the knowledge of Sean and Ian is just top notch ! Didn't take no time for them to fix my game system and they also wanted to make sure it was in great working order before they returned it to me. Price was fare also. This is my new go to gaming place. Can't wait to bring my family here.< /Review>< Date>

It's the store of my childhood dreams and well adulthood has its perks too..this being one of them. It's a fantastic store and they have all the classics and more. They thoroughly tested and cleaned each game cartridge as I purchased it to make sure it will play just fine. I highly recommend this store and wish more were like it as the customer service was out of this world</text>

How much do you charge to repair the screen of the iPhone 7 ?

Went in today and price was exactly what I was told pretty good pricing & my phone screen looks brand new thank you so much !! Definitely recommend !!

Edited: hello after getting my phone fixed with you guys I noticed the screen is starting to pop out I guess it wasn’t glued on right and the protected screen wasn’t put on right either I haven’t dropped my phone at all but the screen is coming off /: edited : thank you so much ! (: my screen is brand new again you guys I really recommend them 👌🏻<//Text>

Went in to buy fallout 3 for ps3, called ahead of time to ask if the game was available, they called me back 5 mins later to let me know they had it in and when I came in an hour later they had a copy waiting behind the desk for me. Game for being old and used was in good condition and works great so far with no issue.

Staff was polite and knowledgeable. Thanks again<//Text>

<Review>We tried to change our minds about an item we initially choose to not repair.  We were told by the owner that he would charge us an additional labor fee just to reopen the order.  Thievery in my opinion! You are better off doing business elsewhere.

Update - it has been 4 hours since my post and the owner is vehemently insisting that this did not happen and that he never tried to charge an additional fee. If you visit yelp, you will find several instances of similar situations and instances of reported unprofessional behavior despite the 4 star rating.

He has also since stated via facebook that he will not charge additional diagnostic fees for reopened invoices. If you go there - make sure your take him on that.

Update - The owner sent me a message via google hangouts that he will no longer be fixing the controller and offered a refund of 20$ instead.  Time will tell.< /Review>< name>

Lancaster, CA has a great retro video game store. Got myself SNES game here for a great price! Parking spots in the front are large, but tough to get. Recommend parking on the side of the building to get to the store quickly. They also do computer and cell phone repair.</Text>

My son took his PS4 console apart on his own and that was the first mistake. Took it in and  Advised them that the console said it was overheating and not working. was informed of the multiple problems it had and even took pictures for me to see. Upfront, decent pricing and quick turnaround on service/repair done on the console. Will be back 👍👍<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1611964047302, 'text': 'Hello Jesus thank you for taking the time to review AV Retro. I want to apologize for your negative experience with us. Recently the State passed Covid-19 Restrictions limiting stores to only 30 percent customer capacity. AV Retro has been abiding by all State and CDC Regulations to keep all customers and employees safe. At times due to this restriction you may encounter a wait time to enter the store. Also when we have a line outside we ask you to limit your time to 10 minutes to be fair with everyone. We do not impose the 10 minute limit if we do not have a huge crowd. As far as the prices Sir, we are a brick and mortar store located on TheBlvd in Lancaster with extremely high overhead and expenses, unfortunately we cannot sell our games at eBay auction prices. Again, thank you for taking the time to review us and hope you have a great day.'}</response><gmapID>0x80c25ac3505674fd:0x9e7e970dc100c529< /gmapID></record>

Very low selection of games. The guy at the counter is knowledgeable. The games are over priced. Game cartridges are faded and they ask for top dollar. They seem to set their prices above ebay.</review>

< Review>
If you're looking to fix a cracked screen, a broken video game console or controller, or maybe an old or even new laptop, then THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Not only did they fix my son's gaming controllers quickly but their prices are the cheapest I've found by far! Did I mention if you follow them on Facebook they even have awesome giveaways and superb promotions! They have 2 locations which are Palmdale & Lancaster. Great customer service, prices, plus swift yet exceptional repairs as well. " I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE & EVERYONE!!!!"< /Review>

I have personally purchased 3 retro systems (NES, SNES and a N64)  and they all worked great.  Additionally had a laptop repaired and the techs there gave it an additional 4 years of life. Between the owner and his brother, you always get a great deal and quality work. This business makes the AV better!< /Review>< pictures>

Got my screen fixed here on the iPhone 6s+ and it was cheap and fast but It sometimes pushes random buttons on the screen repeatedly and I’m not even touching it... not sure if it’s my phone or the new screen. It never did it before the new screen though so idk...< /review>< rating>

<review>My iPhone shattered unfortunately and took it to AV retro to get it fixed. They did a great job and they were done extremely fast even though they were super busy when I arrived. Because of this, whenever I need anything for my phone I always go to this spot! They're friendly, do a great job and they work super quick. I highly recommend this place!

I asked if they could fix my xbox remote because the joystick was drifting and he said that they could so I gave him my remote without a battery because the place looked shady and when I got my remote I didn't want to turn on and I called and asked if he could fix it and he said that I should have given him batterys to make sure that it turned on and he said that I would need to bring it there and see if the repair would cost anymore that the 20 that I already spent.<//text>

Oh My Gosh!!
I am so grateful for this company!! i bought a computer from amazon that was rebuilt. About a week in the computer had an error message but i thought it was something rebuilt computers did so i paid it no mind. About 3 months later it gave me the message again and i contacted the seller and they stated the return was already expired. 2 months after that the computer stopped working and the error message never went away. so i took it to AV Retro and they stated that my hard drive had crashed i asked them if i would be able to save any data because stupid me didnt have anything saved on a flash drive. please people save your information and data to a flash drive just in case. The nice young man said they will do all they can to save my data and they did they were able to save all my information and data. My programs couldnt be saved but i didnt care because he saved my babies videos and pics i am so grateful for this company i would have lost all of my personal information and my work. Why i didnt have a flash drive backup was so stupid. Btw i went to another place before i found them and they stated they would not be able to save anything and they were going to charge me a lot. But this company was so reasonable. Again I am so grateful i could cry!! :)

{'time': 1548519814669, 'text': "Hello Denise, thank you for taking the time to review AV Retro and I want to start off by apologizing for your negative experience. As I recall, you came to us on January 24th for a screen replacement on your iphone 8+. We informed you upfront that there is a possibility that your home button may stop responding after a screen replacement due to Apples design. We asked you how you would like to proceed and you stated for us to proceed with the repair. We also notated it on the work order and asked for your initials to approve the risk, which you initailed. I have attached a copy of your invoice for your records that verify that fact (https://ibb.co/PW3Q4vt). Denise please understand that it's not that I didn't want to try, we give you that warning because there is nothing we can do if it happens. Once again I do apologize that you feel that we were unprofessional, however we were upfront and honest with you. Not a lot of shops do that in the Antelope Valley. Thank You. Invoice attached here https://ibb.co/PW3Q4vt"}<//Response>

Unfortunately some parts for certain models are expensive and that is out of our control, however I can assure you AV Retro is the most affordable repair shop in all Los Angeles County. Our reviews speak for themselves with our affordable rates. I hope you give us another try in the future. Have a great Day'}<//Response>

{'time': 1520886650665, 'text': "Hello Kevin, Thank you for taking the time to review the experience you had with us. I want to apologize on behalf of AV Retro regarding the screen issue. We value our customers and never want anyone to have a negative experience no matter how small. I am happy to hear that we were able to repair the problem you had the first time. You recently came to us in Lancaster due to a black screen issue on your phone, we went ahead and replaced it and became aware of the black dark spot on the screen. We did inform you, to feel free and bring it back and we will go ahead and do a free diagnostics but advised you it may be your back light that is giving you all the issues. You were ok with it over the phone and that was the end of our conversation. AV Retro uses nothing but brand new parts for all iPhone repairs. No used parts are ever used. It is true we due get faulty parts on rare occasions but what shop doesn't. Please feel free to contact me at my direct cell number 661-974-1219 so we can go ahead and get the issue fixed for you. Thank you and have a great day."}<//response>

At the time of purchase he stated he does not need the controller just the system. We informed him it's a complete system we cannot sell just the console without controller. He came back a week later which was yesterday trying to return just the controller telling us he bought it separate and by mistake which was a lie. When we informed him he bought it with the console he still demanded a refund. The controller was not bought separate and was part of a bundle therefore the reason we turned down the return. Imagine buying a telephone and returning just the power cord because you didnt need it. No store in the universe would accommodate a return like that. Customer than got upset and left disregarding our social distancing guidelines set forth by the state and getting close to other customers. We have decided to refuse future service if he would ever come back."}<//resp><GmapID>0x80c25ac3505674fd:0x9e7e970dc100c529< /GmapID></record>

{'time': 1490890504264, 'text': "Hi Dj Johnson, we would like to apologize for your negative experience at our store. As you recall we informed you that unfortunately your xbox one dvd drive logic board was damaged. We came to that conclusion after replacing the drive 2 times with brand new units. Since the dvd drive logic board is married to the motherboard you can't easily replace it. I believe we were more than accommodating in your situation since we worked on it for 3 days straight and paid for all expenses without charging you a dime and offering you a full refund. I truly hope you give us another try. Thank you and have a great day."}</response>

<Response>{'time': 1531320048666, 'text': "Hello Tyra, thank you for taking the time to review my company. I do apologize that you are having problems with your pre-owned computer that you purchased. All the pre-owned computers that we sell undergo a full diagnostics to ensure they are sold with no problems at all. They are also accompanied by a 30 day Warranty. We also offer an extended 1 year warranty that covers all parts and labor for only $40. As I recall you opted out of the offer and declined to accept and therefore the reason we had to charge you. Please understand pre-owned computers are after all electronics that we have no control over if they crash or not hence the warranties we offer. I do apologize but I do not understand what you mean that the computer can only be fixed by us.  I'm sure there are numerous shops out there that could have performed the work. We have been in business for over 15 years and have sold thousands of laptops throughout our 3 successful locations. I do apologize you felt like we deserved a 1 star, however we did offer the 1 year warranty so you would be covered if anything would have happened. Thank you"}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

It is my go-to laundry place. The attendants are very nice and the aisles are wide so that 2 people can walk down the aisles in opposite directions and not worrying about being too close( because of coronavirus). The dryers always get my clothes dry when you put it on hot. The place is always so clean.<//text>

This laundromat is the best laundromat I've ever been to in my entire adult life she's got amazing facilities it's SUPER clean , Nice Wide Open aisles, and a huge selection of machines sizes, Up-to-date technology, EASY to use card machines, And NO CASH? NO PEOBLEM! Debit/Credit Accepted too!! ***So save yourself an extra errands to run by the bank and get so save yourself running an extra errand to run by the bank !!*** Also have a laundry wash and fold service .**Most of all, they are EXTREMELY well priced!!!!!**
I saved over half of what I normally pay anywhere else on my monthly laundry costs(and being on a budget, that matters!) And this staff is super friendly and super helpful. This is definitely my new favorite laundromat and I'm never going anywhere else as long as I live anywhere within 10 miles of this place!<//review>

Our first time today and not disappointed. The place is so big with a lot of working washing/drying machine , with ample place to fold your clothes.The place is clean and well maintained. The old Latino guy was so helpful and courteous.
They have music playing and plants that create good ambiance.< /Review>

My favorite place to wash. Usually a little full. But it's worth it. You pay a good price to get your clothes done they also have music playing so you can dance and wash. They ise a card you add your money too so you dont have to do the millions of coins. I actually like that part makes it so much easier. It is mostly Latinas and Latinos but don't be discouraged you are there to wash clothes 😊< /text>

A large, well lit, clean laundromat, with a LOT of machines and plenty of table space to fold!
I’ve never seen more than ONE machine out of order at any given time, I wish BART was half as great as Maria’s Wash N’ Dry!< /review>

A lot of washing/drying machines. Usually pretty busy during the weekend. They accept credit cards so you don't have to worry about change.</Review>

1st time there.
Loved the set up... very clean!
Employees are super friendly.
Louis did my nails...I loved the way they came out. I have been on the hunt for someone who can do them thin and more natural looking.
They charged a little than I'm used to paying, but I'm super happy with his work!
I've never been charged for removing gels to put new ones on...lol...I guess thats a thing!
Advise: check their price of services online so that there are no surprises 😊<//Text>

Very modern decor, extremely polite and welcoming staff. All covid protocols are being followed. My pedicure was very relaxing and well done though I did have a bit of a lost in translation issues with my technician.
The callous removal ($15)and the buff shiny nail ($10) was a bit too expensive for me and made my total pedicure over $50.
While I definitely liked the vibe I'm quite happy with my $35 pedicure that covers everything above.
If you an afford it, I'd definitely recommend it.< /Review>

<username>Aj T<//username><text>They have 2 brow ladies at this place. (I guessing, I’ve only seen two)
The younger one who usually does this, does an amazing job. The other one just didn’t do it for me. my brows look like nothing was done to them. It’s annoying and now I have to go somewhere else and pay them to fix them. I wouldn’t recommend getting your eyebrows done by them. I mean unless you wanna pay twice to get it fixed.
The staff doesn’t care either. They’re rude and unprofessional<//text>< userid>

WORST NAIL SALON. I’m from out of town and follow their Instagram so I thought it would be fun to go to a place that was popular but my nail broke in 4 days and they couldn’t fix it for free because of a policy. The first place one I went she gave me the wrong pedicure color, was not worth it at all. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I wish I would have read the reviews before I went</text>

<review>DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE. This place was recommended to me from some of my influencer friends . I myself am not an influencer and am a very private person. They rushed so much to get me out of the there because I was not anyone special. Really wish I read the reviews first. The girl at the front desk is also beyondddd rude. When I called to make the appointment I specifically asked on the phone if they accepted american express because I had misplaced my debit card and only have an american express as an alternate card. They told me yes on the phone but went to pay the girl at the front desk said "you should prepare to actually pay before coming to a nail salon. Maybe put aside money prior". SOOOOOOOOO disgusting.

I stopped by this shop to have my gel nails removed from a salon on Melrose. Instead of the nail tech wrapping cotton soaked in acetone on each nail she proceeded to take take a metal spatula type instrument to lift the gel off. Never again would I go here. This salon gets lots of business because Kylie and her friends post pics of their nails done by the owner I’m sure. One star for the salon decor.< /Text>

I had a pedicure and an eyebrow wax. The girl who did my pedicure was very sweet. The seats are that comfy though as they're benches, and I kept slipping down. I'm happy with my toes though. She did s good job and was nice.

The wax however, was not a great experience. I had my eyebrows done, and then waited in the lounge area for my toes to dry. She didn't have a mirror in the wax room, so she had me go out into the dark hall mirror to check, lol. They seemed fine, and I was honestly more concerned about messing up my nail polish. Well, when I got into the light they were quite uneven, there were still a bunch of hairs under my right brow. I've never had wax left over in my eyebrows or on my skin either. She fixed it, but I can't say she was the happiest about it. I don't think I'll be back.<//Review>

Then asked for Matte nails and she kept insisting shiny is better! I know what I like because it’s my style but yet she went with her preference. Only giving 2 stars bc my pedicure lady was amazing!

I was requested to make a post from the owner. In efforts to say Lily is a hard worker and the staff is too. Making an appointment takes effort and finding the right person to do the job right is excruciating. Painful, full set will take 3 employees and management to step in to get it done without a flaw. Day 3 of this experience; Saturday, Sunday and Saturday again... lets hope for the best.<//Review>

<Review>I decided to give this place a chance. I got a gel mani / pedi before heading out of town, and unfortunately within 20 mins of me walking out it was like the nail polish was melting off my fingers & toe nails. Don't know what happened, but for whatever reason it seems like the nail paint didn't take -- the heat of my finger would literally melt it away. It's a nice place, and the ladies were nice, but I just really do feel like I got hustled. Never coming back here again, which is a shame because I literally live around the corner.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Poor quality and customer service. Nails broke and Polish chipped after the 3rd day of getting them done. Contacted Salon thru social media and by phone as well as # i was given to possibly resolve issue and not one response. Won't be going back. Not that they care since they think the celebrity clientele can carry their business. Good luck.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2be1ff95eda3b:0x73afd529cac0eb49</gmap_id></record>

Nail salons are supposed to make people feel fabulous but they are doing the exact opposite.

I hope the owner reads this: Sorry hun but just shut down ur business already.

<review>I went here on a Saturday for gel on my natural nails. Nothing too extravagant that any other nail shop couldn't do. By Monday, 7 out of my 10 of my finger nails are peeled right off. Over the weekend I have done nothing to cause them to peel. I've literally gotten gel and or shellac on my nails for years and this has never happened. They promote themselves on social media with all these beautiful designs. I was very disappointed that they couldn't deliver on something so simple.<//review><Date>1478668648723</Date>< Gmap_id>

Came here for all the hype, wasn’t worth the trip. I wanted a design that they promoted on their Instagram but didn’t end up getting it because the girl who was doing my nails had no type of knowledge on how to put the stickers on. She had asked a coworker next to her on how it’s done & the other lady laughed because she was doing my nails wrong. I ended up having to settle for another design. I was in there for 2 hours & had to pay way more than the nails were worth.<//text>

<Date>1551826057512< /Date><rate>1< /rate><Text>I went in for a Brazilian and eyebrow waxing recently.  The lady doing my waxing didn't even ask what I wanted done for my eyebrows (shape or clean up) she just went for it.  When she was "finished" I pointed out some areas that I wanted cleaned up on my left eyebrow she said ok, I laid back down and she proceeded to put wax and do more work on my right eyebrow and said she was "done" again.  I started to leave upset about my two misshaped and uneven eyebrows she asked why I was upset, I pointed out her mistakes and all she responded was with a "sorry it didn't work out".  Needless to say I didn't let her go anywhere near my girly bits.  I've had good experiences with the mani-pedi part of this place but would never go or recommend their waxing services.< /Text><user_id>112354880616381454279</user_id><username>Maria Jose Baird<//username><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

So me and my husband came to this nail salon I went and did my eyebrows and the lady who did my eyebrows  spilled hot  wax  In my eyeball took 30 mins to take out I was crying from the pain the person who work there didn’t even care they acted like it was normal same day I went to the hospital and  had wax in my eyeball  The doctor took it out My husband called them everyday for 1 week saying he wants the  owner  on the phone  but they said they can’t give the number ?? And they put a  Report  But never did it My lawyer and husband walked in a few days ago  they act like they didn’t know who my husband was   So I don’t recommend them  they said they was gonna call me back but never did  The same day I went to the hospital they said they’re going to help me with the hospital bill and to get a lawyer so I did so now I’m stuck with a hospital bill and I’m wearing a eyepatch< /Text>

Bad customer service. Walked in with an appointment  for my wife and myself. They left my wife sitting there with acetone on her nails until my wife couldn't take the burning on her nails and skin. While they took someone that had just walked in and one of the girls started working on her first when my wife had been sitting there waiting for someone to remove the foil with acetone and no one ever came to where she was sitting to help her with the service she needed. Never going back here again worst expirence for it being our first time here.</Text>

<Text>I called in the morning a little after they opened to make an appointment for later that evening for myself and a friend. When we arrived no one was ready for us and when someone did become available , they tried to separate us - one in pedi one in mani. When I asked if there was any way we could sit together, the young lady made an annoyed face at me and said no. As if this situation isn’t bad enough , the lady that had begun my friends nails made fun of her for wanting longer acrylics. And then cut her and did not apologize.
Don’t wAste your time or money here. These ppl have attitude problems. =\</Text>< Pics>

<text>A couple of girls at my work get their nails done here, and they're always immaculate, so I made an appointment one Wednesday afternoon...
I was coming from a weird job, and already smack dab in the middle of a looooonnng-ass day when I arrived.  I was looking pretty dishevelled; man, these ladies looked at me like they had just seen me climb out of a dumpster and walk in their door!
I forget the name of the girl who did my acrylic full set, she was young and pretty. I really do feel like my appearance that day influenced how I was treated. The girl is skilled at shaping nails just so, even when rushing through the job (something they do everywhere) but there was this rudeness and roughness in the way she spoke to me and handled my precious little paws. At the tail end of buffing & shaping , she got up, went and got a phone, and placed a personal call, which she remained on - shooting the breeze, gossiping, and making plans for later(in English!), through the remainder of my appointment.
The nails still came out beautifully. For various reasons, I had to wait a whole month to get a fill, but I had absolutely zero lifting or breaking in that time!
A full acrylic set with plain polish set me back forty dollars - $15-20 more than I'm used to paying. I left a decent tip ($5) even though the service was really bull. What can I say? I work for tips, so I can't bear to skip out on tips. Some kinda karma deal.
The nails came out delicate, perfectly shaped, lasting. I would definitely go back here based on the quality of work, despite her attitude.  The only reason I probably will not return is the price. There are plenty of spots closer to home that do an acceptable job and charge way less. I am a little curious though, about if I go back in looking rested and put together, if they'd treat me any more respectfully...< /text></record>

If I could give it 0 stars I would, I asked to get my nails soaked off because 2 had chipped & instead the lady pulls them off with a under the nail cleaner! It hurt so bad & it ruined my nails leaving one bleeding when I asked her to fix my nail because it was bleeding she put glue on it and it had blood underneath!!! I got an infection and luckily my nail grew back but the doctor had to take my whole nail off !!!!!! Never going here again !!! Trust me when I say they do not care for you !!! Customer service sucks too they’re all rude</text>

$5 Credit Card Processing Fee ? NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SPEND!! I can see that for a customer who wants to run a small charge but if I spend $70 They still Charge you $5. Then they tell you if you pay CASH you get a $5 discount.

Typical Nail Salon Bull

Merchants charge .25 - .40 per swipe & 2%

Why do we have to pay for your merchant charges on the income you make with CREDIT CARD's ??????

It should be a 2% charge on your total order if you want to be FAIR ! Besides that's NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY as a customer if we want to pay with a CC to pay your merchant Fee's !!!!!

They also have a sign that says under $30 CC fee but then when you go to PAY FOR YOUR $70 service they STILL charge you $5...MISLEADING MUCH ?
It's also obvious you don't want to report your full income as a business IF you offer the option to pay with a credit card you shouldn't charge your customers for it. You want the business of paying customers with credit cards then don't charge us and expect us not to be ANNOYED.

I only have a problem with this issue. There service is great. But that is NOT FAIR. And needs to be changed in my opinion.<//review>

This place is nice and sterilized however I called and made a appointment to come in as my first time with my husband today. We walk in and two of the receptionist straight gave us a dirty look w.e I let that pass second my husband started getting his pedicure they applied acetone to remove the gel polish I had and said to wait for one of the girls so they can start my manicure. I was sitting there for 15 min with the acetone on my nails waiting for someone to come and start my manicure and no one came so a lady walks in asking for a manicure while I am still sitting there with covered foil and acetone on my nails one of the receptionist takes her right away and sits her down and starts working on her mani while I am here sitting with burning acetone on my nails waiting for someone to remove it and start my manicure I still waited 10 minutes although it was burning my nails and skin Until I just couldn't take the burning anymore so I removed the foil and my gel polish and still no one came to help me with removing the gel that was ready to come off or to even start my manicure. I looked at my husband and told him I was no longer going to wait and that I was leaving this place. I told the receptionist Armenian or I'm not sure what nationality she is, that I was no longer going to need my manicure done by them and walked out. she didn't even bother asking why or apologizing. I just dislike this place I am never going back it was my first Time here I was really looking forward to a great experience but these people don't know how to satisfy people's needs or give there best in customer service. Shame on them.< /Text>

Gel manicure very splotchy/uneven when finished, not painted close to the cuticle (looked like about a week of grow out), and started peeling after two days. Would rather pay more for quality any day< /text>

<review>Update: All is good! Daniel called me back and I was able to exchange it for another brand at the same value. He also explained the brand I got didn't have an expiration date like the others, so it would be hard to know it was old. I really appreciate his response to the whole ordeal. I think I was just upset since I had taken my hair down and was ready to get started on it. Thank you Daniel! 😊

This is my second time buying a relaxer from this store and it has been old. I would like to get a refund for it this time. The first time I just threw it away thinking it's just a bad draw, but for it to happen twice is bad business. I really hope they will do the right thing. Will update if they do.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEMTbsHBsQoB2O56XYBpajbqL3Cs0nNTZXbfIW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<resp>{'time': 1609877626365, 'text': "Hi Nakato this sounds very unusual. Are you sure you have the right store? We pride ourselves in our customer service. We don't have any recollection of any issues with any wig customers besides one person that wanted to try on wigs and we explained due to covid we are currently unable to allow customers to try them on. This interaction was smooth and the customer indicated how will they know if they like it but accepted the situation without any issues and purchased a wig. I nor the customer was neither rude or nasty or accused anyone of theft. Please call me the Manager regarding this serious accusation."}< /resp>< rating>

I typically get hair products in LA cause in the valley, not too many stores cater to black hair. This little beauty supply is a perfect alternative. Most their products are aimed at the black customer and they have so many gems. From hair weaves to dye to hair tools. You’ll find everything you need. As an added bonus, it’s a short 10 min drive from my house in van nuys. Prices are pretty reasonable too. Every time I’ve been there, I end up finding/spending more than I planned to! Excellent customer service. They are very accommodating.</Text>

This is the only beauty supply open during this virus when alot are suppose to be closed they have signs available (which I read)  requesting for people to not come in or to stay bye the door while they hand off the items. I even was grilled over the phone before even arriving with uncomfortable  questions , was given the third degree before entering which bye the way he didn't let me enter he was just brutally  disrespectful  and clearly under the wrong attitude  . When I suggested maybe he should be closed if he's at such risk it really isn't anything that's the beauty supply sells that's essential so .....I've been a customer here since I moved to the valley , and have spent alot of cash here . But the way the gentlemen  made me feel today truly was as if it's ok to profit off people  and take their possible  contaminated  money  .< /Text>

this hidden gem the wigs are thick and beautiful and at a low price. I usually buy my wigs online and have to pay for shipping and handling plus the expense of the wig but I’m going to start buying my wigs only from here. LOVE LOVE LOVE</text>

<Time>1564009255465</Time><Review>They have the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I love the people who work here and the products are very inexpensive and the owner was so kind to me.  A plus!!
I have now been in this store twice and the young lady who helped me after two weeks I wanted a product I had gotten previously and ruined but coukd not remember what the name of it was.  She not only remembered me but walked directly over to the priduct I was searching for a said,"Here it is!"  And I had boight a lot of things. I am amazed at their unbelievable customer service.
I only recently began writing reviews and that is because of tge lack of customer service.  I am hoping that by letting people know of places that have exceptional customer service, such as this hidden little place, then everyone will stop rewarding rude customer service with their patronage.
This little beauty supply has EVERYTHING!< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80c29723828b3503:0x2dd4465f22122aa2<//Gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

Updated  update. I dont even live in the valley anymore and I still go here. Love this place.

Update: This is my third time here and everyone always smiles and says hello. Great store.

I just left the store. The customer service was good no complaints and the prices were totally reasonable.< /review>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>I love shopping here! they have somewhat fair prices..BUT every time I go to shop, for my usual supplies, the workers look at me like if I'm going to rob the place lol. It's very uncomfortable. Also the cashier lady has NO Customer Service...she has no idea about the products she sells and she just has an unemotional look on her face. The only reason i keep coming back is because I love the products, other than that I don't feel welcomed when i go.</Review>< pics>

My name is Ksenia. THIS IS A TRU GEM in the area and Even all City. Daniel is a Wizard! He matched my own hair like No Other. People don't believe it's extensions cause it looks like my real hair. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABOVE AND BEYOND! Doesn't matter where I move I am still coming back to this place FOR YEARS!
I have had so many bad experiences with other Beauty Supply stores that finding This One was A Blessing!!! Daniel ordering staff for clients all the time if it's not in stock.  I don't really write reviews but this place makes me so happy that I want to thank them and I want to let other girls/ladies know about Amazing Place called " Beauty Mart on Van Nuts Blvd":)</Text>

It is insane how even thieves can leave reviews nowadays. First they never bought nor brought a wig to complain about. They just came in looking for human wigs. Complained about why the prices were cheap as her accomplice asked weird questions about a curly wig and if it can be brushed out to see what it looks like while the other puts a wig in her shorts. Gets caught and then berates me calling me a "goofball?" after being embarrassed. I ask them to leave and the distractor yells those wigs are old anyways who cares! Then proceeds to leave a negative review...okay. Welcome to 2018.'}< /Response>< Review>
Their human hair is not 100% got one that shed and matted massively, went back to complain and saw the same wigs displayed from months ago still there cos people can tell the difference, I couldn’t...  plus the Asian guy who works there is unreceptive, ignorant and acted like my friend and I were just there to steal his inferior hair.< /Review>

Samantha was knowledgeable, professional & helpful! I was nervous because I had never had a facial before, but she explained everything & customized the service for my specific skin type and needs. She even offered to look over my daily products & suggest new things to try! My skin feels amazing and I will definitely be booking more facials and recommending Privileged to my friends.</review>

The  facial I just had by Veronica at Privileged in Beverly Hills was the worst facial I have ever experienced. I have had dozens all over the world  and this  one has the great distinction of the worst. From the moment of meeting the person to begin with she barely said hello guided me to the  room and didn't say a word . She left and I got undressed and without asking almost entered d the room before I was clothed and  barely asked if I had any particular facial concerns. I had to ask her about what she was using on my face.Then she put an LED light on my face which was a few inches from my face, said I would be under it  for 20 minutes and (by the wayy also said unless this light was used consistently ) (often), I would receive no benefit. Then she left the room for 15 minutes during which  time I became more and more uncomfortable and feeling claustrophobic due to it being a few inches from  my  face. When she finally came into the room, I told her I  was very uncomfortable with this light, and asked if there was something else she could do instead, she asked about my  "package" which was a gift from my husband and I explained I didn't know, she  said she'd charge me more $ for anything else. Total time with this girl was under 40 minutes. She said nothing to me as I left. Everything about this experience (if you can call it that) was wrong. I should have known when I booked the appointment with her and the person said "she's so great" I should have known she was "new and inexperienced". I have never written a bad review  before and I don't like doing it now but I wanted to warn anyone  using this Salon about this person. I had another facial at this salon in November by Kathleen and it was great! I was really looking forward to having this facial as I  am getting over a lengthy illness so you can imagine my disappointment.</text><time>1581112003165<//time></record>

Been going for years now, its it's always a welcomed reprieve from the chaos of life! A refuge for relaxation...then add in a facial. You have the best of both worlds.</text>< Pictures>

I got it Microderm and I noticed that it was Certain part of my face that the person kept going over and I knew that it was a bit much but I didn’t say anything and I just thought she’s really trying to do a good job but I have never had anybody go over and over the same spot and to make a long story short it bruised my skin so the good experience turn very bad. I went to make my face look better and it ended up looking worse.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I've tried scheduling my appointment for over a month. I called several times and no one answered.  I've called during the week and weekends...nothing.  I didnt want to drive up there for nothing. It takes 45 minutes to get there. I'll just get groupon to credit me instead. :-(< /Review>< GmapID>

I have been going to Privileged for several years. This is the best experience I have had in all my life. Starting with a warm greeting, punctuality and wonderful facials. All this for a really good price.
I have received suggestions about how to take care of my skin and never ones felt pressured into buying any product I don't want or can't afford. Can't wait for my next appointment.<//review>

I’ve tried calling to make an appt for multiple days and no one ever answers the phone. Then I receive a weird text saying “let’s schedule your appointment” I replied to the text when I want my appointment and got no response. What kind of unprofessional system is this??<//Text>

I’ll put a little something extra in your account for you for your next visit as well for the inconvenience.'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

I got a facial from Sal and it was amazing.  This is the first facial I truly enjoyed.  Sal was very pleasant and honest, and gave me great pointers on things I can do to improve my skin.  It's been almost a week since I've gone, and my skin is still looking fantastic.  I didn't even have those ugly red spots and stuff that I've gotten after facials at other places (from the squeezing and such; Sal was very gentle, yet got out most of what needed to come out).  I highly recommend Privileged!!!  I'll definitely be back soon!  Oh, and the front desk girl, Kaitlin, is the sweetest!!!!<//Review>

<text>I purchased a 3 microdermabrasion package special online at a very reasonable price.  I had been to Privileged before and had a great experience.  This time I was treated by Samantha who was fantastic.  The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because the treatment room was right off the waiting room and the noise was not conducive to the relaxing experience I had had before.  I would suggest that they remind people that this is a quiet area.  It would have made all the difference for me.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This place is very poorly run, they are incompetent and inconsistent. The salon is very hard to find and if you have an appt at 10 am and have any questions your out of luck cause the front desk doesn’t get there till 1030. The phone never gets answered I wish I could give a negative star. Customer service is a joke! Save your money and go somewhere else it’s not worth the headache trust. I will NEVER come back to this establishment. Don’t say you weren’t warned.</Text>

After my first facial at Priveleged, my face felt great!
I was relaxed and rejuvenated. My skin was vibrant and felt nourished.
A facial made an excellent gift
to a friend, and we will return for more of their expert care.</review>

<Text>I've been going to Privileged for a few years now and just love this place.  They have great specials and it's Totally worth the drive over the hill even though I'm surrounded by beauty salons in Studio City.  Debra and her team are very knowledgeable and courteous!

Every time I leave this place, my skin looks amazing.  The prices are so affordable yet the quality of service and products used are top notch.  I would recommend anyone book an appointment any hesitation.  I typically request Naomi but I'm confident that all the estheticians are equally skilled because everyone walks out of Privileged with a smile.< /text>

The services and facials are great. I say upgrade to the extra peels, it makes you skin beautiful. My only caveats is that they do not provide parking and they can be difficult to book with.< /Text>

Great facials and estheticians. I've been going to Privileged for a few years now and I always get great treatments and good deals or pricing for treatments. Friendly service both on the phone and in person. I have never had an issue booking a service or rescheduling (if needed).  LOVE it here!</Text>

Great place.  The facials are amazing and their prices for packages are great.  They have started selling skin care products that are the best I have ever used.  I highly recommend this place.< /review>

Great service for the great price! They always have specials and I see results immediately. Love the pumpkin peel and especially love the luxurious feel of the paraffin hand treatment.  Best and most affordable facials I've ever received with microdermabrasion and facials plus peel for the best price!< /text>

Although I liked my facial, it ended a little sooner than I would have liked (10-15 minutes).  Granted, the reason was because I didn't need all the 'work' required for the facial, but I went there with the intention of relaxing for a full hour, but that was cut short involuntarily.  I hardly ever have much time to get away and relax so when I do, I really look forward to it and value it, so when I didn't get the full hour as advertised, I felt shorted.  Even if I didn't need all the "work", a nice facial/scalp massage would have been nice to fill up the time I had left.  I guess they just want you in and out ASAP... at least that's what I felt like.  :(  Not sure if you want your customers to leave feeling that way.</text>

I've been going to Privileged of Beverly Hills to get microdermabration & facial treatments since last year & I love it there, all the staff is really nice, knowledgeable & extremely accommodating, from the owner Stephanie to the girls in the front desk. My favorite cosmetologist is Naomi E., so I totally recommend her. For me they are the best beauty spa in town, so I'll keep coming to get all my beauty treats with them :).< /review>

I made three appointments, all three were cancelled by the salon. Maybe it was because I had a group on, I do not know. All my appointments were scheduled for different days and times.  The one I scheduled for a Friday was confirmed on Thursday and than canceled Friday Morning. Groupon, was great , that was the only bright thing in this whole experience. I would never recommend this salon, ever.<//Review>< Name>

I have been coming here monthly for about a year and I LOVE it.  I first got a deal on facials through Groupon.  It was a series of 3 facials and I could not believe the quality level I received for the price.  They have monthly specials, so I am able to come once a month and get my facial.  Sal (aka Assal) is my favorite.  She is so sweet and so thorough.  Booking online makes my life easier as well!<//text>

I got facial there a lot of times around15 times and see most of their facialist, all of them are good and trustable. their price is awesome, you can not find it anywhere else; $30 dollars for 1 hour micro and masks and hand paraffin, its unbelievable!
I highly recommend this place to everyone who want to have good and glamorous skin< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>My first time to do a review. I am not fond of doing reviews online but I need to share my unhappy experience with Priviledged  of Beverly Hills. My worst facial ever!! The one who did my facial keep on asking if  I want to get upgrades since I got the deal from Groupon.  She did ask me 3x in a row. Focusing more on selling than giving a good facial. While doing the facial she keeps on going in and out of the room. I would say she spend more time out, than inside the facial room, then when she cannot persuade me to get the upgrades then she started to sell their beauty products!  I am totally disappointed!</text><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80c2bbf78b8dc8e1:0x31e15ea6b967c154</GmapID><user_name>Gems Leonardo<//user_name>< rating>

Dismissive rude receptionist. Some estheticians are good, some are not such as barely putting the product on and  not really doing the micro derm much or the peel, and barely rubbing the product off. They are not doing the work, . A really lazy facial. Others are fine.< /Text>

<text>I've been to Privilaged twice and both the times it was a wonderful experience. In fact I went with my husband for the second time for microdermabrasion facial with diamond peel. I had the coupon from living social, so I was not expecting much of a service, but contrary to my expectations, I had great time and I got great service. The girl who did my facial, offered me some add ons for extra charge, I tried negotiating, and she agreed to the price I stated after consulting with her manager. My skin was much smoother and relaxed. Also, I had hand paraffin treatment done. My hands were much smoother.. My husband had a relaxing experience as well.
I would definitely recommend going here although parking is little hassle in that area, but except that it is totally worth it.
Also, they keep on giving great deals to their loyal customers.</text>< userid>

Buy a package or Groupon and the prices are very reasonable compared to any L.A. neighborhood and especially for Beverly Hills.< /review>

<Review>I purchased two facials from Groupon and my first experience was less than stellar.  The facialist did minimal work and I felt like it was just an extended face wash rather than a true facial.  But I returned for the second facial in my package and scheduled it with a different facialist.  Deb was absolutely incredible!  This prompted me to buy another package of facials and schedule them all with her.  However, when I went to double check the dates which I had booked online, my appointments weren't listed and Deb was no longer working on the days when I believe I booked the first appointment and the other two facials as well.  I have emailed and called and have yet to receive a response.  I truly enjoyed my last facial and was looking forward to the next three.There has been no communication from the spa and if I do not hear from them soon I will file a complaint, demand a refund of my money, and never use this spa again.  It's very disappointing and unprofessional.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rate>

This place is amazing and anyone who says differently is obviously a rude, self-centered, and pretentious person. You can easily obtain a Groupon for a discounted service price in Beverly Hills I worked with Samantha and got the Gold Mask and the results were amazing. I've been coming here for about 5 years and I've never taken the time to comment or review but after seeing some of the other client reviews I decided I had to because what I've been reading is either a complete exaggeration to look like an avid critic or just someone who can't appreciate the value of a quality paid service. Anyways if your looking for a good esthetician to work with try either Samantha, Sal, or Neda; anytime I've used them i'ts always been a good turn out; especially the Gold Mask! The only thing I will say that's kind of inconvenient for newcomers initially is finding their location entrance. I guess the building owner changed to 'Lari Salon' but when you see that name just go upstairs and you'll be at the front desk reception.; I'd give this place 5/5 stars all day and anyone that says they can beat that value is lying cause I'm super picky about my face and where I go and I've tried tons of other salons in the local area and nothing compares to their price and quality of service. So all this knit picky I lost 5 minutes of my session because I couldn't find the location; (SOLUTION) show up early like your supposed to for your first appointment so losing time on your session doesn't happen! Everyone wants a hand out these days but no one wants to do their part to make the experience the best it can be!<//text>

<text>I tried Privileged Beverly Hills through Groupon; the first time was fine, the second time was just awful.  The esthetician obviously didn't listen when I told her that that was my only day off that week and proceeded to create a giant scab on my cheek the day before a very important photo shoot.  I was told I'd be refunded; still no refund from Groupon.  My cheek is still red where she messed with it.  Beware of them wrecking your face to get an upgrade/extra $25!  Just awful.  Shameful.  Then the owner tried to say that the esthetician was an independent contractor and the business is not responsible, only I trusted the business, not an independent contractor.  Y'all should be ashamed.  Still waiting on that refund.</text><rate>1<//rate><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbf78b8dc8e1:0x31e15ea6b967c154<//Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics><user_name>Sandra Rosko<//user_name></record>

<Review>I came in for the 10th time. I always had a different esthetician and never did any of them do extractions (along with my microdermabrasion). This time Maria asked to do extractions so I agreed. I literally left with scabs on my face and have scars over a month later. I had called a day or two after the facial and complained. The managers response, "We've never had any problems with Maria, give it a few days, come by and get a hydrocortizone cream." WHAT!? So basically, you've told me I can't complain because she has been there for years and never had a complaint before. The whole point of a microderm is to help heal existing scars and I left with low self esteem and more months of healing. AWESOME. Not going to Maria. Everyone else I've had was great.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

i went to Privileged of BH for the  60-minute, microdermabrasion, diamond tip peel, with ultrasonic facial therapy.
My esthetician was Carli, and she was SUPER! She is really good at this. All of the steps were done with sure hands.  The diamond tip peel felt especially good.  My skin felt like silk from the inside, as well as the out, when we were done.
If Carli is representative of who they hire to work there, you can't go wrong.
Privileged usually runs monthly specials, so you can try out the different types of treatments they have to find the ones you like.< /review>

<Time>1616465049946</Time><rating>5<//rating><text>I was referred to Dr. Winter from my wife after I had sustained a chipped tooth. I was told that she was great with cosmetic dentistry and that her and her entire office staff was extremely friendly. My experience was just that and more! Upon entering, Alicia and Deb at the front desk were super friendly and helpful which is huge to me since dentist visits are not generally my most exciting appointments. I was then escorted back by Kat whom I believe was the dental assistant and she too was very friendly and gave me a tour of the office and introduced me to most of the other staff members that we passed by. Once taken to my chair, Kat helped answer all of my questions and helped me understand what we were doing that day and what to expect. When Dr. Winter came in, she was also very nice and friendly like no other dentist I've gone to. As her and Kat were doing their work, they checked in with me periodically to make sure I was doing fine and I don't think I had ever felt so relaxed during dental work! I almost felt as though I could have dozed off in a good, relaxing way. I was impressed at how well my tooth looked after the appointment and started discussing other dental plans I had considered. After the initial visit, I scheduled my next visit and plan to be a long time patient from here forward! I would definitely advise looking into visiting her practice if you are in the market for a home-base dental office or are just tired of feeling anxious about your current appointments! You won't be disappointment by Dr. Winter and her lovely staff!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1616513097835, 'text': 'Really appreciate the feedback!

Nicole at Dr. Winter’s office is the best hygienist ever. She’s an absolute pro and I look forward to seeing her! Not only does she do an amazing job cleaning your teeth, she goes above and beyond to make recommendations that help mitigate future issues. She takes such an interest in her patients and I’ve never had anyone care so much about the wellness of my teeth! Always a great experience with Nicole!< /Review>

<text>I had been looking for a new dentist as mine had recently retired. I've had my fair share of dental work and know what I appreciate from a dentist. From the moment I walked in, everyone was extremely friendly and genuinely nice. When I got called back I received a tour of the office while being introduced to everyone that was working. Doctors included! It truly was a great experience and I felt like a valued patient! Feels good to know I found my new dentist.< /text>< time>

I now look forward to going to my dental appointments.  Most of us are petrified from our experiences in our childhood years. Don’t be! Dr. Winter and the group of fabulous women make me feel so relaxed, confident, and excited to work on my smile. I wanted to do this for years, and wouldn’t have hesitated for a moment if I knew how enjoyable the whole process would be. Don’t even look anywhere else! Call now, ask for Debbie and she’ll get you all set up.< /review>

Every hygienists is so kind, caring, and warm-hearted, and no matter how long it’s been since my last visit, I feel like they always make an effort to make me feel like I am part of the SW Dental family. Sarah of course goes above and beyond to provide personal care, which I find really valuable in a dental provider to ensure feeling like you’re getting cared for based on your personal needs,  and not just rushed in and out of the office.

Can’t say enough great things about every single time I’ve come to Sarah Winter Dental!</Text>< user_name>

Just had a remarkably comfortable cleaning experience, despite the flare up of a chronic condition that creates sores and inflamed gums.  The hygienist was able to thoroughly clean my teeth - and offered helpful suggestions for alleviating the pain as well as an article that discussed possible dietary ties.  Just another example of the caring treatment I’ve come to expect from Sarah Winter and each staff member.< /Review>

<Time>1608072977707</Time><rate>5<//rate><text>This year for many has been a very trying year to say the least.  I would have to say Meeting Dr. Winter has been by far one of the highlights of this pandemic for me.  I had been suffering from migraines and had no idea they could be caused from my jaw. I was clinching so much at night that I had cracked two teeth!  That’s a lot of pressure.
I was not going out at all since March,  she made me feel so safe. Their safety prodigal is excellent. The office is beautiful and so clean.  Dr. Winter not only cared for my teeth but went above and beyond calling to see if I was doing well.  I would highly recommend her and her staff.  You know when she talks to you that you know she truly cares for her patients. My teeth are fixed, she made me a night guard and my migraines have decreased by 85-90%. I sleep better and I have learn our teeth are so very important to our over all health.  You may think a illness has nothing to do with your teeth but a lot of illness can be caused by things going on in your mouth. I also love that she is a second generation dentist (after her father).<//text>< Pictures>

Dr. Winter has assembled an amazing team that is tough to beat!  Your visit will begin with a warm, friendly, professional greeting and no-hassle administration by the front office team led by Debi. The offices are comfortable with lots of natural light. It can’t be easy to do during this time of pandemic, but Dr. Winter’s team makes you feel safe, welcome, and cared for.

Next up is your visit with one of their amazing hygienists. My visit was with Alisa, who was pleasant and friendly, and also clearly good at what she does. Her work was efficient, gentle, and thorough. My teeth felt awesome when she was finished!  Like the front-office team, she assured me and made me feel very safe in this pandemic environment. It is clear that this team has invested heavily - time, dollars, and energy - to create the safest environment possible.

Bottom line, this is a professional, top-notch team and office. They make you feel welcome, safe, cared for, and in the best professional hands from the minute you set foot in the office and for as long as you are a patient!  Do yourself a favor and put your dental health in their hands!</Review>

<time>1611352337857<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I highly recommend Dr. Sarah Winter Dental. It had been years since visiting the dentist- so this could’ve been really bad- but Dr. Winter’s team’s clear directions and efficiency made my appointment great! I was a bit nervous and can’t remember the name of the woman who helped me check in, sanitize, and temperature check, and fill out consents-But She was friendly and made me feel comfortable, which is hard during Covid times! Debbie helped me schedule and explained what to expect (Even checked back with me when our call was cut short). Jenn was kind enough to make sure my insurance would cover my appointment beforehand. Nicole was efficient and quick with my new patient x-rays (didn’t even need to leave my chair for them- Bree came in to help Nicole chart my gum health which made this part very quick!). Nicole also walked me through everything she was doing and what I was doing wrong with brushing and flossing. And finally, Dr. Winter examined my teeth, x-rays, and pictures confirming that Nicole had gone over any issues I might be having and if she saw anything troubling (luckily nothing!). She also has a great Instagram account with tips for dental health and great before and after smile makeovers. So happy I was referred to Dr. Sarah Winter!< /Text>< pics>

They are accommodating and super friendly with smiles behind the masks. They follow protocol of covid guidelines and they are right on time with my appointments which I super value!!

Dr. Winter and her star hygienist Nicole always take great care of me. I've got problem teeth, and I feel I get their full attention. Care is very comprehensive. And the covid safety practices appear to be top-notch from check in through procedure. Overall it's a little pricey, but I feel strongly that I get what I pay for - excellence.< /text>

The front office team is professional, yet very warm and welcoming.  Trina was my hygienist, and she did an amazing job, both thorough and gentle.  Dr. Winter was willing to take the time to explain what she saw in my x-rays and answer any questions I had.  What a great experience all around - I have a new dentist, and you should go see them too!< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>I LOVE everything about this place. Dentists in the past have made me scared to go to the dentist. Dr Winter and Danielle are the sweetest people EVER! They made me feel sooo comfortable & like they knew me forever. They made me feel like they care so much about me and what I want my smile to be. Bree is so knowledgeable & made all my future appointments with what’s convenient for me since I do come from out of town. 1000% worth the drive! I can’t wait to come back.< /Review><userid>100326887643728052362<//userid>< response>

<review>Nicole is one of the best dental hygienists I've ever had.  She is very kind, she takes her time and does a very thorough cleaning, and is gentle.  I don't feel like just a job to her.  She's engaging and has an easy laugh and a good listener.  Also the front staff at Sarah Winter Dental is professional, caring and kind.<//review>< Pictures>

Dr. Winter and her staff are amazing! I was so lucky to have her help me and my smile. From cleanings to veneers, her and her team can do it all. She is helping me get my confidence back through my smile and I couldn’t be happier (smiling while I’m writing this). I am constantly recommending her to everyone I meet and would go back to her for work ten times out of ten.  If you want your confident smile back, or want your good smile to be GREAT, call Dr. Winter!< /Review>

I was blown away by how great the overall experience was: with full teeth cleaning and detailed and caring check up with Dr. Winter!   I was in the hunt for a new dentist when my prior one moved to Sacramento.  I’ve ended my search and am so completely satisfied I’ve made the right choice,  I’ve already made my next appointment.   Thanks Dr. Winter!!

I went to Sarah Winter dental office for the first time on 3/3/20. It was a wonderful experience from the reception at the front desk, to the amazing hygienist, Trina, to Sarah Winter herself! Trina gave me the best teeth cleaning I have ever had. Dr. Winter was professional, caring, and informative.
I highly recommend this office!

Everyone at Sarah Winter Dental has been wonderful! My husband and I are new patients, and everyone has made us feel welcome and comfortable (in case you’re like me and don’t particularly enjoy the dentist). So far I have worked with Hygienist Nicole and Dr. Souza. Both were very kind with me and were helpful in explaining everything they were looking at as well as tips to improve my dental health. I am grateful to have found Sarah Winter Dental and recommend them to anyone in search of a dentist.< /review>

When you walk in the door you are greeted with friendly (masked!) smiles. You can tell right away that Dr. Winter and her team are lovely people who really care about their patients’ comfort, health and well-being. The care I’ve received there is excellent.  Dr. Winter uses all the most cutting-edge equipment, including health and safety precautions. I feel very safe there and I’m so glad Dr. Winter is my dentist!<//Text>

I have been going to this dentist office for years and a couple years ago I started seeing Sarah Winter. She fixed some aesthetic black pits on my teeth. My teeth are much whiter and the pits are filled, which will help eliminate the creation of a cavity. Recently, they did a full x-ray and scanned my teeth for the invisalign braces to correct a crooked front tooth.
I definitely recommend Sarah Winter and her staff.</review>

Sarah winter dental is by far the beat dental office I’ve been too. They are so nice and warming. Their office had a nice homey feeling instead of the typical boring dental office. Leah cleaned my teeth. She was great! Very knowledgeable and gave me a bunch of helpful tips. She was also very gentle I didn’t even feel my shots. My teeth and mouth felt so much better afterwards! Definitely have to try Sarah winter for your next cleaning !<//Review>

I wouldn't say that Sarah Winters makes going to the dentist a pleasant experience, something to look forward to, but she comes close.   Nicole always does the job of a consummate professional in cleaning my teeth and finds any areas of concern for Dr. Winters to examine more closely.   Highly recommended.<//Review>

I wish I could explain how grateful I am to come across Dr Winters Instagram. I had been looking for places to get my teeth worked on for a beautiful smile for my wedding. It was perfect timing finding her beautiful before and after pictures. When I went in for my consultation she did not pressure me but was very informative of the possibilities to a journey of a beautiful smile. I am now absolutely in LOVE with my smile. I feel like I could trust Dr Winter with my life. I am so confident in her work and so thankful I chose her. The most personable dentist you will ever meet! And she has Netflix for your procedure. :)</text>

They gave me a new smile that changed my life!

Everyone was super nice and caring. I’ve been into a lot of other dentists in La Jolla, and Dr. Winter really knows what she is doing. Couldn’t be more happy with the entire experience. Thank you all very much!!!!</Review>

<review>Sarah Winter Dental is everything you could ask for in a dentist office and more.  Every part of the experience from scheduling an appointment, the actual procedures, and follow up has been beyond what is expected of a dental office. Everyone in the office treats you like friends and family. I highly recommend. A special thank you to Debi, Leah, and Dr. Winter!< /review>< username>

Dr. Sarah Winter is the best dentist I have ever been to! Her and her entire staff do an amazing job. I've always dreaded going to the dentist but Dr. Winter and her wonderful team of hygienists and assistants make dental procedures painless and comfortable. When I first arrived at the office, I was greeted by beautiful smiles from the front office staff. After filling out my forms, I was called into the back where I was set me up with a blanket, headphones, and an iPad to watch Netflix. I watched a couple episodes of my favorite show and before I knew it, my procedure was done! I'm so happy that I can finally go to a dentist and have minimal anxiety. I can't recommend this place enough. If you want the highest quality dental experience possible, you have to come to Sarah Winter Dental.<//text>

Great experience from the moment you walk in. Starting at the reception area where you are greeted with a smile all the way through to the consultation and exam where you are walked through and informed of the entire process. The staff is very friendly and personable. If you are new to the area or just looking for a new dental experience, i highly recommend Sarah Winter. Her and her team helped me have the confidence to smile without reservation.</review>

< Review>
I have been visiting Dr. Winter's since she took over my previous dentist's practice a couple of years ago. I needed an exhaustive below--the-gumline cleaning. The hygienist  I regularly see is Nicole, I really appreciate her work, thoroughness, knowledge, and especially her enthusiasm for her work. She did an excellent job for me this time (like always). I was comfortable throughout the procedure, and afterwards as well. I had clear instructions for what to do next, and all the supplies to do it. I highly recommend Dr. Winter's practice!< /Review>

<Review>Never in my life have I been to a dental visit and looked forward to it. Dr. Winter literally is an outstanding amiable person who is very welcoming and understanding. You can tell a lot about a business owner from the way they treat their employees.This felt more like a family household than an establishment. Talk about "girl power"!

Helping the patient feel at ease is key but making the patient laugh and smile the whole time is perfection. Dr. Winter provides a twist of education from a subtle comedic approach forcing the process to fly by.
Leaving her office having been equipped with this new knowledge and even better smile I am blessed to have gone here. I live all the way in Los Angeles and do not mind the drive because the experience is well worth it</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc03fcc841eeab:0x2af9aefa916bfc9b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Pics>None</Pics><Text>I must admit, I’m one of those people who completely avoids dentists... I’m a bit of a scardy cat when it comes to needles or other sharp things poking me. Dentist appointments for me had always been soo uncomfortable and painful that I started avoiding them altogether. If I’m being honest I hadn’t had a teeth cleaning in over 3 years before seeing Dr Winter. I’d say I take pretty good care of my teeth on my own but it’s important to have a professional also take care of them.
I originally was just going to come in to Dr winters office for a whitening, but was talked into a teeth cleaning because it would make the whitening results much brighter. So despite my anxiety of the teeth cleaning I decided to give it a shot. Alisa, one of Dr. Winters assistance was the most gentle and compassion conscious hygienists that’s ever worked on my teeth. Without me even expressing my anxiousness, She rubbed a topical numbing gel all over my gums prior to any sharp objects coming near them. She even applied lip balm to my lips intermittently through the cleaning so that they weren’t getting roughed up in the process, I kid you not this was the most easy breezy teeth cleaning I’ve ever had! And now I’m not afraid to come back for my future visits!!
Now my teeth whitening was also super quick and painless, Cat did such an amazing job of keeping my gums protected from any blanching and we achieved two shades whiter than before!
Might I just add what a beautiful and kind group of intelligent ladies work at her office. 10/10 would recommend< /Text>< gmap_id>

I used to dread going to the dentist, now I look forward to seeing Nicole, the dental technician who does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth. It's now a pleasure.

<review>I moved to the area about 6 months ago and was overdue for dental check up. I loved my old dentist and was nervous about finding a new one. Dr. Winter was recommended to me by a friend and I am pleased to report a 5 star experience. When I arrived, the little bit of dental-anxiety I had was diminished. Dr. Winter's office has a very comfy-cozy waiting area with coffee and tea! I was greeted right away by the friendly staff, this is not the typical lackluster experience I'd expected from a dental office. The hygienist, Nicole, was very gentle and thorough. I felt very comfortable and now my teeth are squeaky clean. Dr. Winter and her staff were friendly and knowledgeable. I feel confident my future visits will be just as easy and comfortable.< /review>< pics>

<review>Love the Sarah Winter Dental crew!!

Dr. Winter and her team gave me a great breakdown (that I could understand in non dentist terms) of what was happening in my mouth. They gave me a few options of how I can improve my oral health at home with a few simple suggestions. Dr. Winter also fixed my insecurities about my smile which I am SO grateful for! I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a local family owned dentist.<//review>< pics>

Dr Winter's Dental is amazing!  Very professional & friendly staff.  Clean and cozy office.  Had the best cleaning experience with the hygienist Nicole. Dr. Winter recommended me for a filling.  The filling was quick and painless.  Definitely recommend!<//text>

I'm retired and have had a lot of experience being a dental patient over the years. She uses up-to-date technology and has gentle, skillful technique that makes procedures painless and fast with great results. She's reasonable, personable and she pretends to get my arcane jokes. I think you'll like her.</Review>< user>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I just had my first cleaning at Sarah Winter dental and it was the best dental experience I've ever had. My hygienists name was Trina and she couldn't have been more helpful and caring. The whole time she was very aware of how i was feeling, and made sure I was comfortable the entire time I was there. I feel like this dental office goes above and beyond what you would typically expect from dental care.
I got to see upclose high resolution  photos of my teeth through a small camera linked to a large tv. Very cool!
And also I hadn't gone to the dentist is 7 years.... -_____-
So you can imagine how scared I was!
There was a lot of work to be done!
Sarah winter made my experience feel so much better, and made my treatment plan very clear and straightforward.

(PSA: DONT SKIP THE DENTIST FOR 7 YEARS!)
Dental offices can be intimidating, but when you are in the chair at sarah winter's you can look out at the trees and greenery through the bright windows and feel more at ease. It was actually quite relaxing!

And Scheduling was so easy!
The front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating to my schedule.
I'm very happy that I chose Sarah as my dentist, and I feel super confident about the health of my teeth!< /Review>< user_name>

Walking into the future of dentistry! I have never seen such attention to detail, kindness and technology in one office. Sarah Winter's office has happy, smart, receptionists, talented assistants, as well as an 'all star' named Alisa who gently cleans your teeth and tells you about cool new dental products that make your life much easier. So gentle!I  Last but not least, have them give you a warm scented towel after your procedure , and you will think you're in a spa!</text>

<Text>Changing dentists is always stressful.  I have had a lot of wonderful dentistry over the years.   Our dentist, who we loved,  moved  away.  Sarah Winter took over his practice.  WOW!  My first experience was for cleaning with Nicole.  She is so gentle and thorough, best I have had in a long time.  I needed two crowns to replace ones I had for over 40 years (got my money's worth on those).  Dr. Winter is without a doubt the most pain free dentist I have ever met.   She was not happy with the color of the replacement crowns and she had them redone.  They are PERFECT now.  The fit, feel, and look is wonderful.  Have no hesitation; call lovely Liz, she will set you up with an appointment, and the rest of the staff will take care of you like you are family, family you really like!  Welcome to La Jolla Sarah Winter.  We are so glad you are here

2020 update. Another great visit with Nicole our favorite hygienist. Sarah Winter dental is the only place to go</Text><response>{'time': 1487611727907, 'text': "Judy, on behalf of everyone at Sarah Winter Dental, thank you for the wonderful review and all your kind words!

Outstanding Care!  I'd moved to Sarah Winter's Dental practice as my lifelong dentist had retired, and she made me feel extremely comfortable during what I'd consider to be a terrifying dental situation.  Like many people, I have a fear of dentists, but when it was all said and done, I'd been made very comfortable, and constantly well informed.  When it was all over, and I was handed a mirror, I was extremely pleased, as the work Sarah had done was above and beyond my expectations.</Text>

I recently visited Sarah Winter Dental due to suffering from TMJ and terrible headaches. My friend referred me and told me she was great.   Dr. Winter spent so much time with me and gave me a thorough exam.  She reassured me that she could get me out of pain.  And she did.  With a combination of a splint and Botox therapy, I am totally pain free.  I didn't even realize this treatment was available, but Dr. Winter is an expert.  I've had no issues ever since!!!   I am so pleased and highly recommend going to her for all of your dental wellness needs.  Dr. Winter really took her time with me and explained everything warmly and thoroughly.  Beautiful office and friendly staff!<//text>

< Review>
Dr. Sarah Winter is the dream dentist everyone wishes for! I have been a patient of Dr. Winter’s for about 2 years now and she is the best dentist I have ever had! She is incredibly diligent, meticulous, and efficient in her work. I’ve had several cavities filled by her, sometimes multiple per appointment, and never once had ANY soreness afterward, which is unprecedented in my experience (I’ve had a shocking amount of cavities filled in my short lifetime). She’s also taken extra time to clean up additional decay on teeth adjacent to the one being filled, so I know patient health and care is paramount to her.
Additionally, I got 4 porcelain veneers put in by Dr. Winter, and the result was absolute perfection, they are incredibly natural-looking, I could not be more pleased with them! Dr. Winter really does have a very discerning eye and executes her vision impeccably.
Her staff is AMAZING, as well! Liz will never fail to brighten your day with her sweet smile and endearing demeanor, and Danielle, Bre and Cyndee are so attentive and warm, they always put me at ease and make me feel like I’m chatting with friends instead of at a dentist appointment! Thanks so much for everything!< /Review>

<review>I have been getting my car swashed here for YEARS and today I had my car washed and had left something  in the car as a test to see if it would disappear And when I went to go look for The item, it was gone. Also there were clearly visible spots that were still dirty on the hood of my white car as well as debris on the carpet that should have easily been picked up by the vacuum. I called to let them know that my item was missing which I was absolutely positive was there when I had let them take my car back to clean it and they offered no compensation for my missing property. I will not be going back or recommending this location.</review>< user_name>

Pretty good job. They missed some dog hair in the very back. My biggest issue was that it took an hour and 15 mins and the place wasnt even busy. That is unacceptable. I'll come back here, but make sure the place is empty.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><text>I made a horrible mistake coming here.  The car was kept for a simple seat and carpet cleaning (which took 9 hours) and it was returned with a battery disconnection error, an engine light on, and a LONG list of other things that I cannot mention here but are detailed in my police report.   I had driven it directly from Jiffy Lube where all inspections were done and everything was fine so I have a crystal clear baseline.  I have NEVER posted a review like this before but this experience was so utterly unbelievable that I still can't believe it happened.< /text>< Pictures>

This place is a den of thieves. I had my doubts at first but decided to test if its true. I left a few dollars in my sun visor and it disappeared. My $200 Ray Ban sunglasses went missing, and I was 100% positive that its always in my car. I confronted the management about it but they just covered up their theives. If you do decide to go to this place, make sure you dont leave anything valuable in your car.< /text>

<text>Great value for the service they provide.

Update:

The service and quality here have diminished considerably over the past year or so.

The two girls at the front desk today were so rude I nearly left.

Eating chips and drinking soda like they were at a picnic.

I actually felt like I was disturbing them.

Will be looking for another carwash.<//text>< Date>

HORRIBLE SERVICES  EXPERIENCE This car wash service has deteriorated in it service (big time).
In the past i had used their basic-car-wash service with satisfaction. This time i went for a VIP service.  The quality was worse than the basic service.They did not even bother to wipe the door runner board and tires rims and the floor was vacuumed badly. On pointing out the issue the staff  gave lame excuses. They lied that they don’t cover the rims and runner boards they Have to charge me extra $20  more in their cleaning service.  And it took 1 1/2 hours
A total indifference to client satisfaction even if they paid premium bucks for the premium service.Will never ever use this service again !!<//text>

I have had problems in the past at this location with windows that are smeared when they dry so I specifically asked if they could use a clean cloth for the windows.  For the third time, I had to wipe the windows inside and out with my own cloth when I got home as I could barely see when the sun hit them on my way home.  The vacuuming is also hit and miss - this time it was mostly miss.  They are definitely getting worse in the years since they opened.  The price is very reasonable but I go there so I don't have to take time to clean my own car< /Review>

I've been waiting for 40 minutes, and my car hasn't gone through the wash! The entire place is filthy, full of trash, and the office/waiting room is filthy. Nice employees, but WOEFULLY understaffed. I'll forego the bargain price next time, and go elsewhere.< /review>

<text>Have returned for recleaning... bad service
upd. 07/11/2016
Again... Full service has risen in price ... now 19.99
Quality of service - uploaded to photo
I pointed out the shortcomings, I waited for 10 minutes until someone comes ...
no one
I called the manager, she looked up and said - it happens.
All!!! No apologies, no proposal clean again.
Simple - "It happens"

I never will recommend this horrible place for nobody< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808561286e579fc5:0x8b4d8f2878576a86< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>This car was was so disappointing. I paid $40 for the VIP wash and when I got home there was still dirt all around my dash/ I'm the pockets of my door and on my spoiler. It's like he just sprayed cleaner and freshener without actually putting time into my car. A few days later I noticed my back floor mat was missing. I proceeded to the wash to ask for my mat and they gave it to me all wet. They also offered to call me and rewash my car however I never recieved a call back. Never coming again.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

The wait is excrusiating. Over one hour and the place did not have many cars in line.

Will never go back. The guys  work hard but too slow.

Counter staff not friendly at all.< /Review>

<Review>I love this little office chair!

First, it’s adorable.  It’s a really stylish design, and the color is very pretty.  I love the velvet material.  Second, it’s just the right size for my small office and desk.

The chair came quickly, was very easy to put together, and works well.  I love the forward tilt - it helps me maintain a proper posture while sitting at my desk for hours.

One thing that surprised me was the height it was able to adjust to - the lowest setting is actually what fits my current desk, but I think the chair possibly goes high enough to even work at a taller crafting-style desk.

Overall, I am very happy with this chair.  It’s comfortable and looks great in my office!< /Review>< pics>

Air track inflatable gymnastics tumbling mat with pump

The mat is super strong, water resistant and very long, 16 feet long! It could have many uses, some being practicing karate, cheer leading, exercising, yoga, just jumping up and down and having fun. You an use it indoors and outdoors and even in the pool. It is strong with a max weight of 220 pounds. It has heavy duty handles for moving it around after its been inflated. You can even connect more than one together with the velcro and loops it has in the ends.</review>

<review>I recently have received several wonderful quality products from Costway. Excellent value and quality. The mesh office chair is amazing, I work from home, I sit in it all day and I absolutely love the comfortable design of the chair. It has many adjustments to make it fit your personal body type and preferences. The multi-function Weight Bench and Sit-up Board was an outstanding addition to my home fitness equipment. Very sturdy, well-built and stores nicely. A real plus for me is the monitor which keeps count of your reps, calories, time and total count Finally the 24-inch bar stools come with heavy duty hardware with locking washer to keep the stool together and sturdy. The leather covering is very soft and the seat is comfortable enough for sitting long period of times. I find that Costway is an excellent online source that you can trust. Their customer service was a very positive experience for both my husband and myself.<//review>< Rating>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>They sent me the wrong item and refused to send a replacement. Eventually they refunded my money and said I could use that money to purchase it at twice the price I paid for it. Communication was very poor and their phone lines and chat lines were unavailable, stating that they were closed even during the recordings stated open hours.

All I wanted was the correct product I ordered and to send back the wrong item they sent. They implied that I was trying to scam them vs trying to resolve things with a customer. I have been a promoter of their products in the past between patio furniture and umbrellas. I will no longer recommend them based on their service after the sale.

Update: Costway responded below, but has yet to show interest in helping. I have an open case open with them through the Better Business Bureau. They also have a chain of back and forth emails with me. They will email me or use the BBB portal if they want to help further.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1622766166788, 'text': 'Hi Jason, we are sorry to hear about your disappointment with us, and we would like to assist you with making things right.

<Text>Bough a beautiful rattan bar from Costway -- One simple word for it: CHARMING. It took us about an hour to put it together – a word of advice to prevent heart-attack over missing parts: the crossbars for the chairs are packaged in the seat under the cushion. Also, heed the advice of only tightening the screws about 50% until it’s all together, otherwise you may understandably have some difficult incongruity to deal with towards the end. The rattan parts are super solid, the glass top elevates it to a level above “simply rattan” as you can see in the pic, and the whole thing, when assembled, feels much more luxe than the price would suggest – our rattan furniture was much more pricey but the quality seems remarkably similar. Anyway, we finished, as you can see in the pix, it turns our little backyard into a bit of an oasis, even somehow managing to make everything look more lush than it was before! We’re super happy, and that’s before any drinks have been made 😊<//Text>< GmapID>

<review>Item number 71526893. This is one of the best deals☝🏾. So it’s a gaming chair with a massaging pillow that can be connected through usb to your computer. It has several reclining options and a secure foot rest. Completely comfortable and firm. Costway shipped it to me almost as soon as I ordered it. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Was very easy to put together because the instructions were straight to the point. Everything needed to assemble is provided. Seat is beyond comfortable. Cord to usb is more than enough which allows a nice radius. Also includes a lifting and lowering lever to adjust height. Definitely a game changer!!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I wanted a steam cleaner because I think it will be handy in a number of areas, but the truth is, one area stands out for me: my BBQ grill. I HATE cleaning it. HATE it. The caked on grease and soot on the side panels takes a TON of elbow grease to clean, and so I put it off for months and months at a time. Enter this steam cleaner from Costway. I had ordered one from another site, but when I saw the price on this one, I wanted to see if it could do the job as well. And I wasn't disappointed as the before and after photos will show you -- with a fraction of the effort, I cleaned that grill side panel until it sparkled. Also including a photo of all the attachments, as well as one showing the cleaner all folded up nicely afterwards and bearing the battle scars of the soot from its massive cleaning effort -- does Costway sell a machine to clean it's machines? (;  Easy to use, a great price, and great results -- what more can you ask for? Needless to say, the other steam cleaner I bought from the other site is being returned pronto...</Text>< pictures>

<review>I hate companies with bad service! That's my main complaint. If you need service or questions answered, you are hung out to dry. Wait 2 days for an email response. That's the only solution.

If you want cheap prices and SLOW and INEFFICIENT service, this is your company.  Companies should be judged on how they handle problems, not when everything goes the way it should ... why? Because normal is normal and should not be recognized as good.

Problem #1
I ordered 2 sets of office chairs. I was supposed to get $40 off my order per the online promotion. Instead they force applied a coupon for $12 off. I removed the coupon at the checkout and the $40 again got deducted. When I went to pay, they removed the $40 off promo and only gave me the $12 coupon. I only realized it after my order was placed. It seems like they do this on purpose. Show you a $40 off in your cart and then change it at the last minute to give you a lower savings. Ultimately after 2 emails and 3 days, they refunded my money for the difference.

Problem #2
As I stated, I ordered to 2 sets of office chairs. Only one was shipped out. The other box doesn't show it left the warehouse. Here we go again, I have to email and wait.

I would rather pay more with a company that is efficient and can handle customer service issues, be accountable for it's actions, and not have trickery in the check out process when offering discounts.

My order number is 101057341. Don't leave a canned answer of how your sorry and work so hard to avoid these issues. Pull up my order and reach out to me. More importantly, send me the merchandise I paid for.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

Still have not received my order.  I ordered a folding table. I only ordered it from them because it was supposed to be shipped within a couple of days and I needed it for this week.  I also planned to buy many outdoor items for my house, after closing on it.  Now, I'm not sure about that.
The item I'm waiting for is not expensive, just needed it soon.  I can't imagine spending thousands only to experience more of same.
After reading some of the reviews here, I'm hoping that my folding table doesn't arrive damaged.  That would make a bad experience worse.
I will update this after receiving my order, hoping that I'll have good things to say.< /review>

<Review>Got a great massaging footbath from Costway! This is a great foot bath that is collapsible for easy storage.  It has massagers on the bottom to massage your feet and it will warm the water to the exact temperature you prefer.  There is even a little “medicine” compartment that you can put aromatherapy oils into and such.  The collapsible feature is really easy to do, you just push in the center in it flattens the foot bath so you can store it under a bed, or in a cabinet.  Overall, it looks really sturdy and is a good value for the price.  I highly recommend it.</Review>< pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I'm really disappointed with the patio set. After spending over $900 it started fading & cracking in just a few months. I tried to get a replacement table last year but the customer service rep told me that I wasn't eligible since the order had been placed over 90 days ago even though I hadn't had   the set for 90 days yet. We want to sand it and use some weather proof stain, but are afraid that it would break in the process. I definitely feel like I didn't get what I paid for. Costway responded to discuss the issue only to give me the exact same "it sucks to be you" response. I paid for a weather treated patio set, but the table itself was fading & cracking in just under 90 days of receiving it. There had to be a defect. The chairs still look great, but the table is horrible. Buyer beware.< /Text>< Pics>

We bought my sister a fire place insert model EP24789 fireplace at Christmas.  This insert is a fire hazard.  We tested it for a few minutes to make sure it worked. It came with a 15 amp plug.  The booklet it came with also stated it was a 15 amp plug and Costway's website also states it.  She used it on low setting for short intervals. During a cold snap she put it on the high setting for 15 minutes to get the chill out of the room. As she went to unplug it, the plug was hot. She had an electrician look at the outlet, which was fine and that the fireplace and/or plug must be defected.  After contacting Costway, we were told she needed a 20 amp outlet.  We wrote them back asking why does the fireplace have a 15 amp plug, and the booklet and website state 15 amp?  They said they would take it back and refund us only if we had the original box and wrapping.  This was a Christmas gift, it had been over 2 months, we did not save the box or original wrapping.  They came back and said we could keep it and they would only refund us $50.  This is wrong on so many levels.  The fire place insert is a fire hazard, and could have caused a fire and worst scenario, death.  They should take the fire place insert back without original box and refund us the full amount.   I would never buy anything from this company again.  I rate the product 0 stars and their customer services 0 stars.  So disappointed in a company not taking responsibility for their product.< /Review>

I absolutely love Costway!  They have great products at an affordable cost.  I got a jacket for my son and was extremely pleased with the quality and durability of it.  It’s made to last and does exactly what it says it will.  I definitely recommend to anyone, especially for the entire family!</Text>

It was like I was in a candy store, but with competitive pricing!
Everywhere i turned there were new products to be had. I did eventually pick up things I needed and combined them with a couple things I wanted, and even then was below my budget.
Needless to say it was a win-win proposition. I was happy with the product selection and the professional service. Costco was definitely a good choice.<//Review>

I bought this so that my massage therapist did not have to haul her equipment to my house. She has been a therapist for 12 years and was very impressed with the quality and sturdiness. As well she commented on the simplicity of setup and take down.  On a side note, I suggest buying several sets of the sheet sets at the same time so you can cover the whole table. Great quality and less than 1/2 price of what you pay on Amazon<//Text>

I like that Costway has most things I could need for my home. They have furniture for every room plus outdoor. I can find lots of toys to entertain my child. Grills and raised garden beds. They even have grills and raised garden beds. Good place to go for jackets, and luggage. A good place to take care of all kinds of needs.</review>

<text>I received my air fryer a few weeks ago and have been very impressed by the quality of the appliance and was surprised at all of the included attachments! We haven't done a rotisserie chicken yet but we did make chicken on the mesh trays and it was fantastic! I was really surprised how crispy the skin was but the inside was perfectly cooked and very moist. One of our favorites has been breakfast potatoes, simply chop them up stir in some olive oil and season to taste, then put them in the tumbler.</text>< Pictures>

I discovered Costway a few months ago when I ordered a patio umbrella from them. What a terrific company! Their products are top notch, their shipping is lightning fast, their prices are super competitive, and their customer support is very responsive. They've definitely become one of my go-to etailers! Highly recommend them!< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Exactly what I thought it would be. It's not full-size but perfect for storage, folds out kind of like a card table and it's two separate sides that you hold together with the net. It's very sturdy we are going to use for outside in a covered area and I'm sure it will hold up no problem. At first I was concerned about the size and it being fun to play with but you can still play really well and get used to the size quickly. If looking for a ping-pong table for at home just to knock around with friends and family this is the right table for you.</Review>< user_name>

I love this hooded jacket from Costway!!! It's soft with good quality that keeps you warm from it's heating function in the cold and it's windproof. It's 100% nylon, 90% water repellent and feathered down the other 10% and the sleeves are just right. Overall... a great coat for an amazing price.< /text>

Steam Foot Spa Massager

Are your feet tired? Are you looking to just have a little "home" relaxation? This steam foot massager just might do the trick! It's not your typical home water spa bath. So, don't make the mistake of thinking you're about to dunk your toes into some hot water. This foot massager takes purified water and creates a steam bath, while having a few options for massages. Worried you'll end up spending too much time with it? There are 10-minute and 20-minute timers you can use. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy.< /Review>

<Review>Recently looking to purchase a ice maker for my home. I purchased a unit from Costway and upon receiving the unit I noticed the compressor was completely broken from its base and the oil had leaked out also an electrical connection was damaged. I immediately contacted their customer service dept. The customer service dept wanted me to send pictures of the damage however to do so would require me taking the unit apart. Which im sure would void the warranty. Please avoid this product it really is a piece of junk. I wil update when I find out what they are going to do for me. I have requested a full refund.</Review>< date>

I recently received this kitchen island from Costway, and it is perfect for my small kitchen. I really needed something that would provide me with not only a nice prep and beverage space, but also some extra storage. This kitchen island boasts two cabinets, one larger and one smaller, as well as two drawers. The shelves in the cabinets are easily adjustable to fit your needs. The cabinets open easy, but are also secure with a magnet closure. The drawers glide open like a dream, but have a stopper, as to not accidentally pull the entire drawer out. If you have kids, like I do, you know how important it is for those drawer stoppers to work. The island also features a knife block on the end. One of my favorite features of this island is that it has wheels to easily move it. This is so convenient for cleaning underneath and behind it. The handle, that is on the end, also helps you easily move the island, but also can be used as a kitchen towel or paper towel rack. Overall, this kitchen island is aesthetically pleasing. The materials used to make this are pretty sturdy. One thing I’d like to touch on is the directions and packaging. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve bought things elsewhere where the directions are terrible, and all the hardware is thrown into one bag. That is not the case at all with this! The directions were very clear and easy to follow, and all hardware was bagged separately and labeled. This made putting the island together so much quicker. If you are on the fence about an item, don’t hesitate! You won’t be able to find the same quality for the price. Plus, don’t forget you get fast and free shipping. Do yourself a favor and order; you won’t be sorry!

I was also in the market for a bunk bed for my kids room. I needed one with solid construction, so it would grow with them but also wanted one that was not going to break the bank. This bunk bed definitely fit the bill. After ordering, it took about 2-3 days to arrive. Everything was well packed and protected. It took my husband about an hour to assemble. The process of putting it together goes so much faster, as they have everything clearly labeled and hardware is sorted out into individual bags. One thing my husband really liked was that the mattress slats were tethered together for each bunk. This takes the guess work out of how many to use or how far to space them. The wood is pretty solid and not the really cheap stuff. The bed is very stable, and I like that it is not squeaky if my kids move, like some other beds. The bottom bunk sits higher off the ground and provides ample room to store stuff under the bed, if you would like. Another plus is that this bed is versatile and can be separated into 2 twin size beds, if we choose to do so. Overall, my kids are absolutely thrilled with their bunk bed, and so am I.</Text>

< review>
I have been very impressed with COSTWAY's products and service. I have purchased several products, all good quality, great packaging and excellent customer service. I have purchased a compact folding treadmill (LOVE IT) Adjustable folding ladder (perfect for my cabin) Mini Circular saw (wish I had this the last 6 months). I am very happy with all my purchases.

Absolutely loving my Costway Modern Tufted Accent Chair:  Mid Century Modern Upholstered Accent Chair, w/ Rubber Wood Legs, Button Tufted Armchair, Linen Fabric Single Sofa for Living Room, Bedroom, Office (costway.com)
My wife really enjoys curling up in this chair with a good book. The material is comfortable yet durable enough for our dog Piper to get in a nap on the chair (until she is caught 😊 and we say get down) I personally like the mix of comfort design this chair offers, the bottom cushion is firm yet comfortable for long sitting times while the back support has a soft pillow design which I find very relaxing.
I really like that the back support can be easily removed with a firm pull, this lightens the load and makes it easier to move the chair from room to room and through tight spaces. The construction of this chair is very solid. I found it extremely easy to put together. The most amount of time assembling this chair is fastening the legs to the base. Each leg on the chair has 4 bolts that insure a secure fix to the chair base. Like any product take your time and read the assembly instructions.
Absolutely loving this Costway Modern Tufted Accent Chair! So pleased with the purchase!</review>

I purchased a large 1500W Delonghi oil heater last year from Costway and it really works amazing.
It makes the room warmer, and I just love that it does make your room warmer without making any noise.
I definitely recommend to buy this.<//Review>

<Review>Love My New Exercise Machine!

I was so looking forward to receive my Vibration Plate Exercise Machine with Loop Bands Home from Costway. Delivery was really quick and it is very easy to assemble. Simply just unpack, plug and go.

What I like about this machine is it works out on different parts of your body depending on how you position yourself. My favorite part is the squad position where it really concentrates on working on your inner and outer thighs. And when you stand, it works out all over the body especially on the belly.

Being an entrepreneur and a mom to a 23 month old baby, I can hardly find time to go to the gym or any type of workout outside the house. But now I can with this new exercise machine! It is easy to operate and I could also convince my busy husband to workout on that without any excuses now :)!</Review><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

Costway has to be about the #1 provider when it comes to customer service. They are outstanding and I’ve never had a problem with Costway! I always order online because you get a better deal online in my opinion and the selection they have of products is awesome. COSTWAY you are a 5 STAR. Thank you,</text>

Trying to return a product is worst than preparing for a colonoscopy! They don't answer the phones nor do they respond in a timely manner to emails. I was just on hold for one hour, 2 minutes and 48 seconds and the music stopped playing, (I continued working at my desk) then CLICK - they hung up. They finally approved return of two items however they only sent ONE return label for shipment. DON'T BOTHER with this company there are so many others out there with excellent products AND service!</review>

<Text>Received a fire pit from them, really was looking forward to this particular one as the thatched metal pattern matches our rattan furniture. We received it and it needed to be put together which wasn't too strenuous or difficult as my daughter helped me (see pic). I did notice that the piece the gas tank sits on looks different than the symmetrical piece shown in the instructions, but the gas tank still fit fine (see pic). Anyway, looks great, throws off a great adjustable flame, comes with a top to cover flame area if you'd like to use it as a table. You need to be careful not to pile the rocks too high or that cover won't fit, just takes a little give and take here and there with the lava rock arrangement, Anyway, again, Costway has provided a more premium looking product, IMO, for a lower price. Really happy with it. Recommended.<//Text>< pics>

I have never had nothing but the upmost respect from customer service from every employee. I had gotten confused about a product and the dimensions and one of the employees sat on the phone with me for a good half hour helping to see if it would fit in the location I wanted the stand. I have recommended Costway to all my family and friends because I trust them, and love the prices is a huge bonus 💜</Review>

I have changed my review back to 4 stars since Costway finally did issue me a refund as they said they would! Although it was a long process. (i placed an order, my credit card was charged and I received an email that my order had been shipped. An UPS label was created, but UPS has no record of receiving my item for shipment. I have emailed Costway and am put on hold forever when I have tried to call them to straighten this out. A horrible company. I would never do business with them again.)</text>

What a great addition to our backyard! They came just in time before Thanksgiving and my baby girl's 2nd Birthday!!! I like how the cushion covers are waterproof as it gets really misty in the morning and the seats could get a little wet. They are light but good quality and it was easy to assemble them. Thank you Costway!!! Very fast delivery and great customer service! Now we can enjoy more family time at the backyard!< /review>

<Review>I've ordered 6 items from them. I have not had to contact them outside of placing the orders, meaning I've had no problems. There website is very informative about the items and the entire order process from order through delivery. I keep their site at the ready whenever I or someone close to me needs furniture and such.< /Review>< pics>

I ordered the "rustic brown" office desk. Shipping was on time, especially with the holiday rush.  This is a desk that will go with your décor, keep away that famous clutter and give you a great workspace in your home office. Overall a great experience and will definitely be ordering from Costway again soon!</review>

<review>The chair comes disassembled and took about 30-45 minutes to put together at a leisurely pace. The instructions could be a bit easier to understand but if you have assembled any furniture it is pretty much the same thing. The hardware comes in a nice little package so you don't have to dig through the box to find parts.

I was impressed by the overall quality. The feel is nice. My daughter thought it was really cool :)

The chair is comfortable and the adjustment options are nice: up/down, arms up/down and swivel in/out, and the recline feature is cool though not sure how practical. To be honest when I tested it out it went so far back I thought I was going to fall backwards. I don't even think I reclined it all the way! The one thing that would be nice is if the arm width could be adjusted - right now it would require adjusting the screws.

I work full time from home so I am pretty decently versed in chair prices and for any decent chair you would pay the same or more, so it seems like a decent price and value. I know that many similar "gamer" chairs can run up to 5x more.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>I have had a great experience so far.
My first 2 products have come in.
My first product was a portable ac)fan, dehumidifier and heater.
This product has worked and looks great.
My next product was a hamper (metal) this product turned out not to be what I needed. The construction was fine however I will need a larger and more durable one.
I am getting ready to start the return process with this product.
I will keep you up to date on this experience.
5 stars do far. Costway show me the way!!! U can't use that I have the wrights to that saying<//Text>< pics>

Blatantly bribed their Twitter followers for 5 star reviews in exchange by giving away some jackets. Look on other review sites and you will quickly see their true reviews. Iffy service and bad customer support and refunds.< /Text>

< review>
I bought a gazebo. It took longer than what they promised to receive it. With the Wuhan virus going on I understand. Gazebo metal frame has a bronze color but the 4 bases that attach at the bottom of each post are silver/gray. The instructions label the bases incorrectl. I emailed costway about it, 4 business days later no response. No phone number listed on the website!?!?!!? Really? Its 2020 and you have no contact number? Why are you affraid of talking with your customers?<//review>

<review>I purchased a floor model air conditioner from Costway. It works very nicely. It had a part missing but they sent the part out asap. I just want to update my review. I recently got another product.  I am having a new Grand baby and I got s a portable crib/playpen, I am so happy with it and excited to use it. ❤️  I just got another product from Costway it is a glider swing and I just love it. as always Costway has great products and I love my new swing.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I ordered a beautiful new covered chaise lounge for the pool and it arrived within days and in perfect condition. My 12 year old daughter and I put it together, and the materials are lovely quality—a nicely woven brown lattice body which is complimented by soft-white cushions and a soft white hood. It has a spa look to it and will be perfect in my own little retreat in the pool area. The side table is perfect for coffee and reading glasses. Love it!!!< /Text>< pics>

The sit-up weight bench is prefect for your home gym. Assembly took about ten minutes. The quality is great. The material is easy to clean after your workout. And you can fold and store it away.</review>

<Text>I purchased a dining set from Costway. The assembly is pretty straight forward and took no time at all. It’s the perfect size for casually dining with 4 people.

Everything that I have gotten from Costway has been great! My patio umbrella with lights is awesome! It is easy to tilt and easy to let up and down. The glider and ottoman is comfortable and feels like sitting on clouds. Shipping has been timely, even during the pandemic. I will continue to shop there.</Review>

<name>Tonia Watts</name><Review>I received a really nice massaging game recliner. My husband loves everything about it. When he wakes up on the weekend, the first thing that he wants to do sit in his chair and watch football. The cupholder is great for holding his beer, and the pocket for the remote is in the perfect spot.

I will admit that the only thing that made me nervous about receiving a massage chair is that they aren’t all made the same. This one does NOT have those painful pivots that drive into your back. Its an adjustable vibrating massage. Its very relaxing and makes it easier to fall asleep. It relieves any abdominal and back pain. This chair was for my husband but my entire family enjoys it.

Overall, Im happy how Costway came through on this product. The delivery was quick is discreet. You could not tell what was inside the box from the outside, which is great for security concerns. All of their packages that I’ve received from them are discreet. The customer service is top notch and responsive. Thanks Costway!</Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

Bought three zero gravity chairs. Not cheap. All started to rust within 10 months. Called Costway and they would not stand behind their merchandise. Not even a one year warranty. VERY poor value. Horrible non-responsive customer service,  Zero confidence in Costway.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I ordered this ice make from Amazon for our soon to be new kitchen in November 2019. It was delivered and sat in the box and till March when were finally able to install it under our sink. We opened the box, there was no damage to it, everything was in tact and packed perfectly, and then we plugged it in, connected the water supply and turned it on.
As soon as we turned it on the tub started to fill with water. It was able to make ice but the ice fell in the tub of water. I called Costway and was instructed to email their customer service. I couldn't speak to anyone all concerns were to be emailed. I did that and their response times is 24-48hrs. After several emails back and forth sending videos and pics they said the machine was missing the plug and they would send me one. They sent me the plug for the unit 3 different times because i never received it. I finally received it in July, installed the plug, turned the machine on and no leaks! Woo hoo, now I can finally use my ice maker! NOT!!!! Although the machine didn't leak it produced very soft ice and couldn't keep it frozen. All the ice that was made would fall in the tub and melt, until the tub was finally filled with water and half melted ice. It got to the point where the machine would produce ice and it would fall in the tub of water and the water would overflow onto the floor so we had to turn it off. I've been trying to call Costway for the past week. No ring, just busy signal. I also emailed them waiting for a response, which i think is going to come from China which isn't all that great cause they are not very clear with their info. not to mention their instruction manual sucks!  Worst thing ever! The machine also produces a lot of noise to have in a kitchen.
I hate this thing, most of all I hate the customer service offered by Costway. I have a feeling they are going to ask me to get the machine checked or something on my dime, or blame it on me who knows. I'm also going to email Amazon. We are on a budget. I saved up money for this unit. I choose it because it had mostly good reviews. Apparently I got the lemon. All I want is a machine that works. is that too much to ask. Don't buy this unit!!</review>< pictures>

First, the aerator broke the first time I used it-the screw keeps coming out. Second, the power washer attachment is ONLY for a specific brand power washer--there was nothing in the description indicating that--the total purchase a complete waste of money!!<//Review>

< review>
So I started out buying a vibrating pc chair from costway unknowingly via walmart; when it got all messed up and my chair was returned to costway. When I contacted walmart of course they didn’t care they didn’t even respond. I searched and found out who the seller was and emailed them. Costway expedited shipping/provided an excellent discount and was very kind, so when the chair didn’t work I figured they would not care. Total opposite they shipped me another free of charge! What a great company and they have earned a customer for life!!
UPDATE; I received my replacement chair from Costway, it arrived packaged perfectly and in pristine shape. Unlike its predecessor it works great! Also Costway did not request the original chair returned, they said “ so I could have one at work and at home as well” The chair is pretty easy and straightforward to put together. Took about 15 minutes. Once done I found the massage feature is quite powerful! So much so that my newborn can feel it through my body when I’m holding him. He loves it! So I use it to put him to sleep when he’s cranky. The last thing I wanna be sure to comment on is the fact that I'm 6'5" tall and I'm 325 ponds and this chair is very well made! I can tell without a doubt that it will last for many years to come; thanks again costway!< /review>

Thank you for your response. That’s all I really needed to know. No one was explaining to me through costumer service why the shipping was taking so long and why it had changed to 8-15 day shipping. So I would like to redact what I previously said. We can patiently wait for our package. Take care.< /text>

I was looking for a good new countertop dishwasher at a good price. I did the 'mandatory' Google search and found the one that I wanted. Noted its make and model and did a search for that and up popped COSTWAY with the best price, even better than the big online retailer, and the price included shipping. The dishwasher arrvied on time. Now I've had it for a few weeks and it is preforming flawlessly.</Text>

Costway has excellent customer service and as a frequent online shopper, I can confidently say that the quality of the items on their website is superior. Will continue to shop here! Just purchased a Brown TV Stand, and the manual had clear instructions how to put it together. It was simple to construct and it is gorgeous and sturdy!<//review>

<rating>2</rating><Text>I purchased an office/gaming desk off of Amazon. First thing to note is that this product is claimed to be made by Tangkula, which is actually a company based out of California by the name of Costway. The desk arrived in two separate packages when it could easily been one, which leads me to believe the desktop and support system come from different locations...little odd but whatever.

Both boxes arrive and I start assembly. There are a few surface imperfections in faux wood grain as shown in picture. “Wooden” pieces and the black mid section are adjoined by small wooden pegs and reinforced by metal runners. Seems like the hole thing should more securely fastened together. Hexagonal bolts fasten everything together, but poor quality control made it rough to assemble as receiving holes were not properly reamed out.

Next my issue dealing with customer support arises. I found that my packages did not include 2 of the parts necessary to complete construction. I contacted the actual company Costway through their email found on their website and through here on Amazon. Only way to contact them is through email, and it took a long time to finally get a hold of someone. We spoke via email over the course of several days because they only answer in the middle of the night (EASTERN US TIMEZONE). First they told me they didn’t have those parts in stock and it would be 25-30 days until they got more in from China. They offered to compensate me $30 for my wait, but I said no and that if the parts were not there within a week I’d like a refund. So “surprise” they decided to send me an entire half of the order with all the hardware and legs (could of just taken those missing parts out of the box). Customer service was not rude, but hard to reach and odd to deal with.

After I got my replacement parts I finish putting the desk together as detailed. The remaining bolts holes could also used reamed as I said before. Washers would also help prevent any over torque since they need to be securely tightened to prevent any wobbling. As shown in the picture there is a small 1/8” gap on one side between faux wood and black mid section due to poor quality control.

Overall the desk looks nice minus the surface imperfections and panel gaps. The adjustable legs are nice since I live in an older home with uneven floors. That does not excuse the missing parts, hard to reach customer service, and poor quality control. I would not make another purchase from Tangkula AKA Costway AKA Any Other Brand They Use.

PROS:
Simple steps for constructions
Looks nice
Adjustable feet

CONS:
Poor quality control
Missing parts upon arrival
Hard to reach manufacturer
Design flaws (should have washers)<//Text>< Pics>

I have ordered multiple items from Costway. Everything is great quality and exactly as described! The app is easy to use and shipping is very fast and easy to track on the app. The dining room chairs and massage recliner were nicer than I expected for such a great price! Highly recommend this site to find some great deals on furniture and other household items!!</Review>

<Review>I just bought  my Velvet Leisure Chair Set last week, it’s just comfortable and tidy, especially the back lumbar bracket, and the price is very affordable to me, I love my new chair! It's stylish and looks even better in person. The color was exactly what I wanted. It was easy to assembly and everyone can achieve it on their own.<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Recently bought a brand new treadmill from this company , did all the steps, ended up not working/not even turning on!  have emailed multiple times to get a REFUND to service , and got an email back saying “ May we offer you a refund of $50 as compensation for your troubles and you continue using the product? We will use your feedback to improve our service in the future”  ??? No I’m not going to accept this, this product was well over $300 and it’s not even working!! I’ve tried to email again processionally with all the photos attached that everything is packed the way I received it, still no response!

Does anyone know what steps I should be taking if a company refuses to issue me a return and refund ? Because I want my money back ASAP!< /review>

I recently got the 2.25HP Folding Electric Motorized Treadmill and this treadmill is something that I would recommend.  During this COVID-19 Pandemic, I was dying for a treadmill. Finally, this powerful treadmill arrived at my house.  I’ve had other treadmills in the past but, it is nothing like this one.  It is light and easy to assemble.  Is affordable and it fits everywhere. It’s touch screen and it even has Bluetooth. It’s a perfect choice for my family and I.  I’ve been using it for a while and I personally love it!!!!  Try it and you will see.</Text>

I ordered a Christmas tree thru Amazon.  I waited over 2 weeks for deliver and when it finally arrived I opened the box there was no power source to plug it in . I  am very discouraged and disappointed.  This really runt my Christmas spirit.  I tried calling customer service and could never get through.  I really wanted a nice Christmas with a beautiful tree and I cant even put it up.</text>

<Text>Bought an exercise bike from their website, they promise 2-5 days delivery. Its been 3 days since the order show shipped by fedex but when i check the tracking it show status is label created ,not pick up yet. And it show ship from GA to CA. I thought they ship from CA. I would be surprised if the order can actually ship from GA to CA in 2 days. They are not responding to my message is worrisome. I worry time wasted by ordering from them especially during this season. Tried calling the phone number i found on google wait time is an hour.<//Text>< Resp>

< Review>
I've ordered several different items from Costway.com over the last two years and have been pleased with the quality of the items and the speed of the shipping. As a primarily online shopper due to age and physical limitations, Costway.com is a great option to check out to the largest online retailer, in my opinion!</Review>

Husband tried for hours two days in a row to get someone to answer the phone.  On hold music with a recorded message saying how important the call was played over and over.  At 4:00 p.m. PST the first day, the call was automatically disconnected.  This company does not have customer service  etiquette or response at all.</Review>

<Text>It is my first time I purchased from Costway, and I had such a worst customer service ever. I bought a sofa chair for my son but I am not satisfied with the product. The item is not worth with the value; it’s very poor quality. Also it says on the website the sofa chair is for kid but when I received the sofa chair it is too small  for my 3-year-old son. He feels very uncomfortable when he sits on the chair. When I emailed the customer service, they responded to me that they would pay me $8 refund for compensation or I have to pay $25 for shipping return cost. Unbelievable!!!<//Text><user>109709466691217900469</user>< date>

Costway customer service gets 1 star only because that’s as low as I can grade. It should be a negative number to be accurate.

We made our first purchase from Costway on 11/21/20. It was our first, and will be our last.

The items needed to be returned, which is when the adventure began.

YOU. CANNOT. CONTACT. COSTWAY. CUSTOMER. SERVICE.

IT’S. IMPOSSIBLE.

If you email them, which we did, they don’t respond. If you find their phone number and call, which we did, the recording will tell you how long your wait is, and then they will never answer the phone. We called. Twice. Recording said wait time is 35 minutes. We waited for over an hour on hold and they never did answer.

Horrible experience with Costway.

Avoid Costway.

Update #1: Have emailed Costway 3 times now in the past 24 hours requesting return labels for the returns they approved (only after the initial 1-star review was posted). NO RESPONSE AT ALL from customer service to any of them.

Update #2: Magically, a response from Costway, again only after a complaint becomes public. They ignored 3 email requesting assistant.  As soon as I updated this review, they responded again.

Every email we sent, and every phone call we made was IGNORED. The 2 responses we finally received came only after this review of their unfriendly customer service policies was posted publicly.

Below is their response. This is how they respond to customers attempting to return ANY item once purchased.  Buyer beware.

Hi Dan
Thanks for your email
What is the matter with the item?
Please send us a photo or a short video of the damaged areas of the product, so it may assist us in further assess the damages.
Importantly, kindly send us several photos of the all angles of the original package so we can confirm whether it was damaged during transit. Once we got a hold of these images, we can offer a solution accordingly.
Thank you for your understanding.
Kind regards,

< Review>
I recently found Costway when I was looking for a hanging patio chair.  They had the best price on what seemed to be the exact same chair that others had by over $100.  I took the chance and bought it and it was perfect, they are our favorite chairs now.  I've since gotten a gamer chair, air fryer and cantilever umbrella stand (from amazon) for my purple leaf umbrella.  The stand I didn't even know was costway but it exceeded my expectations, was heavier than the name brand stands and included a nice engaging wheel mechanism the morew expensive version didn't have.  Also the openings for the sand/water are massive comparatively, making filling and emptying easier. I will absolutely continue to use Costway as an online vendor.<//Review>

Buyer beware!
This company stole $1000 from us.  We ordered a patio conversation set.  And not only did it not come without any assembly instructions, it also arrived corroded and rusted.
Customer service is refusing to give a return and refund.  We keep getting redirected to email addresses that no one responds to and then get told they can’t return or refund since were in Canada !  It’s interesting, that they had no problem taking our $1000 and shipping this clearly damaged product to Canada. They are a third party seller on walmart so exercise caution.< /review>

I ordered a gaming chair for my son on December 5th. They claim the package was lost in transit and. Then email me to say we can send another but it won’t come till the end of December. So I say okay fine. Well I see the chair finally shipped. Then I see they canceled the shipping. Now the blame game starts. They claim Walmart issued a refund, Walmart says costway did it. This has just been a nightmare. I I Ted. To file a BBB report. Buyer beware.</review>

<text>Buyer Beware!!
First time ordering from Costway. Ordered placed on Dec 1. Realized on Dec 17th I never received my order and couldn't find an email confirmation but the charge was on my credit card. No luck finding a customer service number and the number listed on Facebook goes to voicemail. Found an email so contacted that and their Facebook page. No reply until about 15 hours later and the reply was they could cancel order or ship now. They referenced covid and the holiday which I understand causes some delays;  however I ordered on Dec 1 and they still hadn't shipped my order now 18 days later! There was no understanding, no willingness or desire to make it right by expediting the shipping. When they finally replied to me email it was at 2am (14 hours layer) and since I heard my phone I replied back immediately. Now it's almost another 10 hours later and no reply again. I gave my cell asking for a call to resolve this. This is the worst customer service I've ever seen!  Now I have to try and figure out how to replace this Christmas gift and it's unlikely I will be able to in time. I don't venture often from the main stores I shop and this is exactly why. I've seen several similar reviews like this on Amazon after researching once I was worried I'd been scammed. Will have to dispute the charge on my credit card.<//text>< GmapID>

< Review>
I bought a gazebo. It took longer than what they promised to receive it. With the Wuhan virus going on I understand. Gazebo metal frame has a bronze color but the 4 bases that attach at the bottom of each post are silver/gray. The instructions label the bases incorrectl. I emailed costway about it, 4 business days later no response. No phone number listed on the website!?!?!!? Really? Its 2020 and you have no contact number? Why are you affraid of talking with your customers?</Review>

I ordered this ice make from Amazon for our soon to be new kitchen in November 2019. It was delivered and sat in the box and till March when were finally able to install it under our sink. We opened the box, there was no damage to it, everything was in tact and packed perfectly, and then we plugged it in, connected the water supply and turned it on.
As soon as we turned it on the tub started to fill with water. It was able to make ice but the ice fell in the tub of water. I called Costway and was instructed to email their customer service. I couldn't speak to anyone all concerns were to be emailed. I did that and their response times is 24-48hrs. After several emails back and forth sending videos and pics they said the machine was missing the plug and they would send me one. They sent me the plug for the unit 3 different times because i never received it. I finally received it in July, installed the plug, turned the machine on and no leaks! Woo hoo, now I can finally use my ice maker! NOT!!!! Although the machine didn't leak it produced very soft ice and couldn't keep it frozen. All the ice that was made would fall in the tub and melt, until the tub was finally filled with water and half melted ice. It got to the point where the machine would produce ice and it would fall in the tub of water and the water would overflow onto the floor so we had to turn it off. I've been trying to call Costway for the past week. No ring, just busy signal. I also emailed them waiting for a response, which i think is going to come from China which isn't all that great cause they are not very clear with their info. not to mention their instruction manual sucks!  Worst thing ever! The machine also produces a lot of noise to have in a kitchen.
I hate this thing, most of all I hate the customer service offered by Costway. I have a feeling they are going to ask me to get the machine checked or something on my dime, or blame it on me who knows. I'm also going to email Amazon. We are on a budget. I saved up money for this unit. I choose it because it had mostly good reviews. Apparently I got the lemon. All I want is a machine that works. is that too much to ask. Don't buy this unit!!< /Text>

Not a customer friendly company.  I purchased an item through Walmart which was sent by Costway.  I bought the item during the start of cyber week in November with an expected delivery date of Dec 8th. On the 10th I sent an email to the seller asking if they can please check on the item to ship since UPS showed a label was created just never scheduled for delivery.  The response I received was very condescending.  They scheduled pickup that day and then tell me UPS shows it will be delivered on the 18th.  Eunice (employee) then blamed the holidays for their lack of doing their job.  Eunice says I need to wait and ends it with a "Have a nice day!" as to yell it to me.

Take blame and state it was missed for scheduling; I can understand that happens.
Don't every tell a customer to wait... keep it as an apology and move on
Should have used, I hope you have a nice day.  Using an exclamation mark at the very end is the same as here is your info now F*** off.</review>

<Text>Love my Castaway 6 in one multicooker! We won it in a Facebook giveaway. The first thing I cooked was boneless pork ribs in BBQ sauce. OMG, it was delicious. We used the slow cooker feature and they were perfect after about 6 hours. The multi cooker is very large, easy to use and I just know i am going to have a blast with it.</Text>< username>

Thank you so much Costway.com 💙 😷
A major challenge of the coronavirus is PPE shortage. One such solution was the face shield, which can protect facial areas from droplet contamination when used properly.< /text>

This chair is perfect for my small living room. I like how if feels soft to the touch, looks very nice too. Love that it warms my back and gently vibrates it also. Also like that I can choose to use only the heat or just the vibration or both together. HIGHLY recommend Costway and this chair!</text>

On two seperate occasions Ive ordered the same product, a 44qt car fridge for camping. On both occasions I've been sent a completely irrelevant item that has nothing to do with the original order.

The items delivered do not match up at all with what I've ordered. This is out right scamming and fradulent activity.

First time I was sent a circular drink holder that was made of cheap plastic. I decided it was probably a mistake and ordered it once more, but this time I received a cake decorating kit. These are completely random items and are no where near the value that the fridge is worth.

I reached out to them the first time, which was a few weeks ago, and havent heard anything at all.

How does this even occur?

Please advise,

-Jesus</Review>

I Love Everything That I Have Recieved From This Excellent Company . I Recieved A Table From This Company Once Before And It Was Damaged I Contacted Them And They Offered Me A Replacement Or Another Item . I Had No Problems And Customer Service Was So Nice And Responsive And Shipping Was Super Fast . I Love All Their Products .They Are Made With The Best Materials And Durable . I Would Highly Recommend This Awesome Company . I Recently Recieved A Knitted Ottaman . It Came At Just The Right Time As My Mom Needed It For Her Legs . She Loves It ❤❤❤ . Thank You Costway So Much .< /text>

<text>Worst company to even think about purchasing items from. Can't even deliver their item to UPS so customers can have their item in a timely manner. Lazy responses of "give us extra time", its now coming to 2 weeks for them to even give UPS the item. Probably in the hopes of the customer forgetting their purchase and getting away with an item that is not in stock. Once again stay away from this company.< /text>< Pics>

This company is a complete scam. My table came damaged, tried to get a replacement part. They sent the completely wrong part. Then they said they would issue me a refund of half the sale price. Never got the refund. Sat on hold for 1 hr trying to talk to someone. Eventually they just stopped returning my emails. Don’t waste your time or money< /text>

I bought a garment Steamer. It broke out of the blue 7 days after warranty expired. No customer service on the US whatsoever (they will forward your e-mails to China). Tried to get a spare piece once I found out what the problem was (Plastic button that releases the steam broke) and their reply was that there are no replacement parts and I am out of warranty! BAD JOKE! Will never buy anything From this brand again!<//text>

Excuse me - where is my order? I've sent in an e-mail for a status update as my order has been hanging in limbo with information stating "the shipping information has been sent to FedEx," however, in checking with FedEx, they have not received my order to deliver. I tried calling Costway, however, the phone number listed on their site is no longer in service. I'd like a response please, or I will just cancel my order and get my money back.

< review>
I ordered this set for our new brick paver patio and I am so pleased.  It looks very nice and completes the look I was going for.  The set is super easy to assemble.  One can put together alone with maybe a hand needed here and there.  The cushions are nice, not too thick, but it gives the buyer a chance to buy new ones according to their style/taste.  The items seem durable and will hopefully last awhile outside in the elements.<//review>

have had a terrible experience with this company. I spent 400+ on my first order with them and after 3 delays in shipping it finally came, only to be the wrong item. The company does not include any info in the box. I immediately called the company and waited on hold for an hour. they did not help me at all i sent in photos documenting i received incorrect item. I received an email from their escalation team who has no phone number i can call saying they wont send me a return shipping slip for several days and that ill need to wait until they receive the incorrect item in order to ship me what i paid for . I will never do business with them again. there is nobody i can call to get help.<//review>

Bought a “folding bike.”  Fast shipping and delivery.  The bike came out of the box well packed and in good condition with minimal assembly needed.  Not a “costway” issue directly but I found the bike decal a bit interesting...< /text>

For the price these are great. I was afraid that for this cost that they would be cheap.....but they are well made. I have them on my patio where they get a lot of use.<//Text>

*1 MONTH UPDATE* I have since filed a claim and sent several emails to Costway customer service, and I have gotten shuffled from one agent to another, with no resolution. I've received no response or I'll get the same response: "I'm forwarding your email to cs.us@costway.com." Now this morning I received a message that they do not sell the connecting pole for the base (the exact base the Costway agent told me to buy for my umbrella). Another agent recommended I purchase a whole new set. As a sole-providing single mom to a 12 month old baby girl (I also work full-time at home while caring for my daughter full-time without child care due to Covid), all I wanted was to provide a shaded area for her kiddie pools that I bought her for her first birthday on July 10th, so that we could have some fun in the sun at home. I now have a very costly umbrella and base I cannot use (junk now on the side of my house) and this whole process has been eating up time I just don't have. After no resolution from Costway, I'm now submitting a claim to the BBB, and as I'm beginning the process I see that several others have submitted claims too. I only wish I did my due diligence before starting this whole purchasing fiasco, I would not have bought from Costway had I read all these reviews/claims. And I would've had the shaded area set-up for my daughter on her birthday (July 10th) as I'd planned over a month ago when I purchased the umbrella/base from Costway (June 17th.) I'm hoping for a refund for the umbrella and base so that I can buy another set somewhere else.
_________________________________________
I think this is the first bad review I’ve ever written. I purchased a 15’ double umbrella from Costway. It came without a base which I overlooked (it was pictured with a base but they did indicate in small print that the base was not included.) So after several (I mean several) emails to service@costway.com and calls to their (909) number (perpetual busy signal) I was finally sent a link to a base that they said was compatible with my umbrella. I ordered the base ($100) and it arrives without the connecting pole or square metal plate mount. I have now again emailed and called another dozen times and nothing. I also spent an hour on the phone with Home Depot and newegg (retailers of Costway products) and they’ve both recommended I submit a claim, as it appears To me and them that Costway is selling overstock, dismembered parts that are useless on their own (without the hardware to connect them, which they are not supplying and Home Depot also does not have.) Avoid the hassle and wasted money... I’m a single mom and this was for daughters 1st birthday to provide some shade over the kiddie pool I bought for her. A big expense for me. If you dig there are many reviews just like mine. I’m submitting a claim and hoping for the best.<//Text>

I ordered a air purifier and when I received it the product didn't work. When I emailed about the issue they had me send a video of the problem. Once I did that they sent me a photo of how the air purifier should work and once they realize after I told them that the fan inside it isn't coming on, they offered me a $45 refund if I took it to get fixed somewhere. The product was new so why would I take  it to get fixed when it was suppose to work upon arrival to my  house. After a week of emailing back and forth they finally gave my money back and refused to take the product back because it was messed up. That goes to show they knew they sent me a busted product.</Text>

<text>I use this weekly and it does great. I've had it for 2 months now. I connected it to my existing cold water inlet from my old washing machine. My washer broke so this was a great cheap alternative temporarily. My dryer is in the basement so I put it down there. I leave the lid open to avoid any mildew smells and I turn off the water to avoid any leaks, just in case. I have it attached with a regular washer hose. You should use Teflon tape to avoid leaks.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipON2enuX1xTcuwstQZScYWtwUzBP5B20Z2Gu8Wf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1564712492176, 'text': 'Hi Mete, Thanks for your feedback.\nWe aim to give you much better products.\nHope you have a great day.\n- Costway'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb5ca7aeb2565:0xa524c555cf6e9b65<//gmap_id></record>

I purchased a GO PLUS Magnetic Exercise Bike Stationary Belt Drive Indoor Cycling Bike. Upon receiving I noticed there was an incomplete part discovered during assembly. I contacted Costway via email and twitter with picture and information. They responded and sent me the complete molded part. It took some time to recieve the part as that was explained in the initial correspondence and it was close to the time Costway customer service said it would take. While I waited for part I was able to make bike functional in the meantime. But needless to say the bike is solid now with the complete molded part. I give the review 4 stars for that reason. It's winter/snow where I live right now and I have no concern about the elements outside because I have a workout room set up and now this indoor bike to complete my 24 hour fitness area in my place. I'm 56 and I bike often in the summer outside. It's an important part of my complete workouts and have spent more than a few winters suffering by not having that option indoors. I do not have that concern anymore. Anytime day or night it can be GO TIME on this bike. The heavy 30 lb flywheel is just right. The belt drive is whisper quiet. And the magnets. Oh man.... I just rotated the adjustable knob in a full 360°to move the magnets closer to the flywheel. The new resistance level is kickin my butt so my numbers for speed and distance are lower of course on the LCD monitor that also observes time, calorie and heart rate. But that's what great workouts are about. Time to climb that mountain all over again. I can't begin to describe how great the workouts are with this spinner bike. It's full-on intense and worth every minute. Just what I was hoping for when I bought it. I wish the LCD monitor would show miles instead of kilometers but it's not difficult to calculate your kilometers to miles, kph to mph, etc. That would be the other reason I gave 4 stars for this review. In closing. Thanks Costway for a great spinner/indoor bike. I bought this on Cyber Monday and Costway provided a hard to turn down discount that also  included free shipping that swayed me from buying another bike from a different company. This Go Plus bike may not be a famous brand name. But at this point it is my experience and opinion that I would put it right up there with any spinner bike that has comparable specs/features.< /Text>

I placed a order never received the item instead they shipped a box with a satin face mask with a tracking number instead of my electronic item. I called the company and was hung up on. I now have to file a police report these are very shady people scamming. Beware!<//review>

Great product for the price. Easy to assemble however some of the longer screws on the bottom shelf did not want to go in so I had to leave them out. Pretty sturdy even without the screws.</Text>

Do NOT purchase from this company. I cancelled an order THE SAME DAY that I placed it and it hasn’t even shipped yet but they won’t refund my money!! I guess the company is taking the trade war out on customers because their policy says if you cancel same day, then the order is cancelled without fees. There is no way my order shipped via USPS from CHINA to Arizona in less than 6 hours. I have also contacted the BBB as well as my bank to stop payment   And before the Asian autobot who can’t spell, responds, saying you can’t find my order, my emails to customer service had both pictures of my order as well as the order number. I want my money back now!!< /Review>

I purchased an adjustable bed with remote due to health issues. The bed worked for twenty days and that is it. I believe the issue is between  the remote and the control unit not being in sync for the head and the feet to rise.  Their customer service is in a foreign country and the way they word things means differently from what we mean here.
Between getting ripped off from Costway and getting ripped off by the people  I have the warranty with on this product - don't buy from these thieves. They are nothing but CON ARTISTS.
Unfortunately to get this message out to others you have to put a one star.</Text>

Terrible company. Bought a $200 shower wheelchair for my mother who has ALS and the chair was deemed unsafe for her to be sitting in while under the water. NOW have to pay an outrageous $45.00 shipping return fee just to send it to CA from FL.< /text>
