<pictures>None</pictures><review>I’ve been officially divorced since 2013 it wasn’t amicable at all. I’ve hired 2 previous lawyers in the past years. I learned that the ex husband together with his father and brother who is a lawyer too, has been conniving and was bribing my lawyer during that time and the same incident again to the second one I’ve hired. I learned it the hard ways and the reality of the old clichè “ money’s talks “ was indeed true. The ex really played it dirty in court.
My hope was thinning  down and with constant prayers I found the Law Office of Atty. Elizabeth Yang. I was fortunate enough to talk to Atty. Elizabeth Yang, I told her about my issues and my financial situation. She is very kind and accommodating to my needs. Her office gave me Atty. James Wellman to represent me in court. He is very understanding and very straight forward to what to expect in the outcome. He listened to my statements and he fought hard for me in the court.
I am Very happy with the result afterwards. In other words I won my case.
I am so grateful to Atty. Elizabeth Yang, Atty. James Wellman and the rest of the staff in her legal office who has been very supportive throughout. I Highly Recommend Atty Elizabeth Yang’s Law Office.< /review><user>110674267881694987024< /user></record>

<text>About a year ago I had a dream of opening up my own restaurant.   There were many things I had to take into consideration and one of them was trademarking my restaurants name and logo.   Elizabeth was very helpful and explained the entire process to me and made the task super easy.   All I needed to do was send her a couple images of my logo and restaurant name and she did the rest.   Now that my restaurant is open,  my trademark is on place and I don't need to worry about anyone ever copying my name or logo and using it as their own.   Thank you Elizabeth Yang for being so helpful and making this process so easy!< /text><userid>103448492464857946533</userid><Pics>None< /Pics><gmapID>0x80c2c7b3c3859483:0x9c321d2fe7d3d47a<//gmapID><date>1483942282537<//date><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

< Review>
Elizabeth Yang makes legal matters simple and easy.  She is quick in providing answers to my questions and very patient when working with me.  An advantage of working with her is the ability to take care of intellectual property rights both in U.S. and China.  I have consulted with other attorneys before and they tend to be very serious and boring.  Elizabeth is much more pleasant to communicate with and her nice personality is rare quality to find in the legal industry.<//Review>

Amazing person to have in our lives as counsel and also friend. Super proud of all her growth in recent years and could not have found a more dependable legal counsel for my variety of needs. I have worked with several attorneys in the last 20 years and Elizabeth is definitely my favorite!

I highly recommend Elizabeth even if you think you can handle it yourself! Get that free second opinion before making things worse.<//Text>

I would recommend Law & Mediation offices of Elizabeth Yang to anyone who is looking for settling any dispute from a business matter to a family situation. I visited her office and everything was handled very professionally. Elizabeth Yang is very knowledgeable and I had done my research on this law office before calling. Excellent Law Firm and I will use them again.< /Review>

<text>My experience with Elizabeth  Yang and her partner, Natalie Schneider was very positive.  They are very knowledgeable and thorough in their practice of law.  Unfortunately, with the recent death of my husband of over 55 years, I was unable to retain their services and for that I sincerely regret.  I wish them continued success in their professions.
Sincerely,

A month ago I met one of Elizabeth's associates at a Small Business conference and described a problem related to consumer protection law that was costing me thousands of dollars. Elizabeth offered a short, free consultation where she reviewed the relevant documents and helped me to quickly identify the legal sticking points. Even though consumer protections aren't her primary area of expertise, she was sharp and on point in a way that translated into powerful impact.

That 15 minute consultation gave me the leverage I needed to hone in on a prime legal weakness / pain point in the counterparty and to thereby stand on my convictions (that I had been wronged) and negotiate from a position of strength. Elizabeth was also kind enough to send me back a couple one-line emails for feedback during the negotiation process.

The result? Thanks to Elizabeth I saved thousands of dollars. Thank you Elizabeth Yang!< /review>

< Review>
-was pulled over at night by CHP on the 101. Multiple cars were going around same speed as me. Asked why he pulled me over and he said "your speed". Knew there was no point to argue with CHP officer. Signed citation and consulted Elizabeth afterwards. She patiently shared step-by-step instructions on what my alternatives were to dispute the officers erroneous accusation and offered strategy to get my bail money back and eliminating points in my record. We went thru the process and I was happily surprised when my citation was dismissed by the judge. Got back close to$500 in bail, got the points removed, and justice was served. The process was long and drawn out because courts move very slowly. Many insights on how the legal system operates was also shared.

If you felt you were unjustly treated by the police in a similar situation, I highly recommend reaching out and having a confidential discussion with Elizabeth on staff. Don't just accept and pay bail money to get it off your plate. It's the points that ultimately will affect your license and insurance premiums! You will be glad you did!< /Review>

< Review>
90% of the time everything is great. I went in today for eyebrows and 3 other services. I stated I just need my eyebrows cleaned up, as they were already shaped... When I got home I realized there was way more taken off the top edge corners of my eyebrows. I called and the girl I spoke with said they're going to refund me for my eyebrows next week once the manager comes in, which I appreciate, but I will have to draw in my eyebrows for the next several weeks in this heat until they grow back in. :/ I've included what my eyebrows looks like shape wise prior to this visit. I shape my own eyebrows. Now they're not quite even, I feel like the poor waist had to rush since for some reason there is only a 30 mins time frame given for 4 waxing services. I find it a bit odd that the system doesn't give a bigger timeframe than 30 mins. I'm super uncomfortable with how thin my eyebrows now look.</Review>

<Review>Rain is the best waxer I have ever had in my entire life, she should be training the other staff on a national level. Seriously the angles that she uses to wax make it virtually painless. I have gotten several dozen bikini and Brazilian waxes and when Rain performs my service I get almost NO ingrown hairs or rashes and my skin is extremely sensitive. On top of that she is professional and interesting to talk to while receiving your wax service. I have had so many decent and good experiences with EWC but she is phenomenally more talented than the others. I went to another location to get my back done and broke out really bad even when using all EWC preventative products. I will only schedule with Rain from now on until her last day with EWC. Please give this woman a raise and appreciate her as she is a godsend. Any woman knows a good Brazilian wax makes all the difference. Thank you Rain and thank you EWC for using and creating high quality products.< /Review><Name>Lisa Pennes< /Name>< rating>

< Review>
My waxer was Ruby and she was fantastic! The only reason why I'm giving this a 3 star and not 5 star is because I thought it would be more spa- like atmosphere with candles, essential oils/diffusers, and the like. But that is not reflection on Ruby... she was great.

Ruby was friendly, made me feel extremely comfortable for my first time there, and she was very experienced. I complained about how cold the room was but she let me know that it had to be for certain reasons concerning the wax. She also told me that pretty soon I would appreciate the fact that it was cold because when she started waxing my body would heat up... LOL she was right< /Review>

I walk in for. 10/30 appointment and someone walks in after me. The idiot at the front counter ask the other person if they had an appointment and not acknowledging me or asking me first.  This place need people with better customer service and front desk etiquette

Very good experience, although more than twice the price of my regular place. (It was half off because it was my first time, though.) My place couldn't fit me in, but here I got an appt immediately. They use a different kind of wax and it hurt way less than usual. So that's awesome! But at $54+ dollars for a bikini wax, I probably won't go back until my tax bracket changes.< /review>

<Review>I am very, very particular about any and all spa services I have done. Iyanna is a the best and super professional. She "cured" me of a fear I had from a bad experience with another salon decades ago.
Not only is she professional but also a "girls, girl" so she understands and walks you through each step of the process like a Dr would - explaining how it's going to feel, why and giving the much appreciated "good job" after each luxuriously bsmooth waxing!
I literally strutted out of this place because of her.
**Also tip to all ladies that Iyanna shared with me and it is so true - do not get waxing services during your cycle, it will hurt more"  - You're welcome< /Review>< Pictures>

<time>1493446369143< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I just moved to Oakland 10 months ago from Mumbai, India (yeah) so finding a waxing salon had been on my list for the first weeks. After reading all the reviews I gave it a try at this one. I booked my full body wax (full legs-arms-underarms and brazilian) online and was extremely relieved when they had an opening the very next day! WOOHOO!!! Giving that I haven't waxed since early June I was desperate and needed an immediate booking. I tried many other places but no one would book for a full body wax in such short notice. This place had a complimentary wax (bikini or underarm) for first timers so that was lovely. I went to the place on time and was greeted immediately by the receptionist who very fast brought up my booking appointment. Was immediately introduced to my waxer - Tigris who was lovely. The place was really clean and I was impressed. To all the ladies who have not given a 5 star I don't know what they expect more really. I have been waxing religiously since 2008 and have tried different type of waxing in many countries starting from local waxing in Everett, MA (terrible experience) to a luxurious SPA in Boston, MA to waxing in Albania (my hometown) with Australian wax products to Mumbai, India where I lived for 5 years before moving to Oakland. In my personal 8 years (and counting) of waxing experience, this place doesn't deserve less than 5 stars. Tigris was wonderful, she was nice and fun to talk to. She made me feel really comfortable and answered all my questions. This was for me the first experience having a full body wax with hard wax  - I usually have had soft wax applied for arms and legs and hard wax for only underarms and bikini area- but this was amazing and was done in less than 1.5 hours - YAY! And surprise surprise it didn't hurt AT ALL! The wax temperature was more than fine (I have been burned before in my past experiences) and Tigris was more than nice to ask me many times if the wax temperature was good for me. This place also has 3 different body lotions to choose from after waxing - this was superb! Also, very impressed with their techniques and products - pre waxing cleanser to remove oils, baby powder for the Brazilian area and pre wax oil for the wax to stick on hair and not skin and then waxing and after wards anti bumps/ingrown hair product and finally lotion - what more would anyone want for under 200$ for a full body wax? Sorry but if you still have complaints then something is wrong with you not the wax center. I will definitely return to this lovely place which is conveniently located 10min from my house and has time options to choose from. Clean, efficient, friendly and pain free. I came in hairy and ugly expecting the worst, left feeling rewarded, truly pampered and beautiful. Thank you again to the center and Tigris becuase I have been going to this place ever since!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Time>1621109089028</Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>I do not write yelp reviews often… especially without having been asked to do so by management (which they didn’t ask here) but I feel compelled to do so because of the absolutely amazing experience I had yesterday at Generation8. I have been to SO MANY tattoo&piercing shops in my life, more than I can count; and the experience is usually the same. I’m usually met with snooty, snobby, upturned noses who could care less about my existence let alone my patronage. My experience yesterday at Generation8tattoo couldn’t have been more different.

I was half expecting to be understandably turned away since all I came in for was to replace a ball that had fallen out from my already pierced rook (without an appointment). Not only was I squeezed in and taken care of right away but the owner/manager (?) tried to not let me pay since it was such a quick & easy job. I was blown away. I insisted that they keep whatever cash I had to go towards the piercer’s tip.

While I cannot speak to the quality of tattoo or piercing work done here as I haven’t been tattooed or pierced by anyone yet, I still wanted to leave a review about the absolutely fabulous customer service and friendly treatment I received from all staff I encountered. They took me seriously despite having a  silly, simple request. I find THAT to be what brings me back to a business more so than the quality of their work, although I can tell they do high quality work at Generation8 as well. The shop was way bigger than meets the eye, was clean and cool looking with a totally welcoming vibe. I will most definitely be coming back asap!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bed551f4a105:0x34acf62ce97ba956< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>It's very clean place and people were nice there. I just didn't have good experience with my artist Nana.

First she showed up late (no apologies from her).
And event though I explained to their assistant what kind design I want with pictures when I made appointment (that's what I was asked for) the artist said she never saw the information I provided in advance.
So I explained everything and gave her the exact same information, I found out she wasn't good at making her own design after I waited more than 2 hours. Also she doesn't speak English well, so it was difficult to discuss about designs with her.
I should have just leave at the point but I was really looking forward to getting a new tattoo so I decided to stay and get it over with.

There is a part she made mistake and I need touch up, but I don't know if I wanna go back again.

I gotta say she is skilled, her line is really good. If you have the exact design that you don't need to change it at all, then I say she is good.</Text>< pictures>

Love this place! The owners of this place are good people that give back to the surrounding neighborhood and have fantastic artists. Currently getting a piece done by Hiro. Looking forward to giving more business to this shop!</Review>

I am the world’s biggest baby! Thank god for Lucy! I got both my lobes pierced today and I was feeling dizzy and sweaty, I told Lucy that and asked for water. She thanked me for letting her know and went to get me a water. Next thing I know Lucy is saying, “Sit up, sit up.” I had passed all the way out. Fainted, whatever you want to call it. I went to Lala land for, I don’t know how long. But Lucy helped me and talked me through it and made me feel not like a giant loser, 36 year old man who couldn’t handle getting the same piercing most girls get from ages 0-6. Women having a much higher threshold for pain. But honestly, it didn’t feel that painful. Not sure why I passed out. Who knows? Anyway, it’s all good now and I love my piercings. Thanks again, Lucy< /Text>

<review>I had the honor to be inked by Claire the other day. She did fantastic job. I am very proud and pleased to wear her work.
When I had my consultation with her she listened and gave her suggestions and Incorporated her ideas, and mine into one of my existing tattoos. I could not be more pleased.
Claire has a very light touch and has great knowledge about her craft.
Thanks Again</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

(taken immediately after tattooed) Awesome location. Hella dope interior, it's like a Generation8Tattoo.  The price is great... definitely amazing quality. Chill welcoming atmosphere. Just let the artists do their work, I promise you they know what they're doing. Oh yeah, & Jared tattooed me.<//review>

We stopped by today without an appointment after researching for hours online.   We thought we were going to make an appointment and look around, we got lucky  They took us in right away.  Kim was phenomenal, helpful with ideas and the work was perfect.   She didn't twinge and it didn't hurt, she used a tiny needle.  And, was very sweet and supportive.  We are definitely going back for all future work.  :)</Text>

When I saw his new establishment, I was blown away! Very clean, lots of artists doing amazing work and we couldn’t help but to finish up another tattoo for my wife when we were here.

<review>I can't begin to say enough good things about Generation8Tattoo. It's rare to find such a talented group of artists under one roof, but the fact that every one of them is likely one of the nicest people you'll ever meet is uncanny. If you're going to spend hours on end under a tattoo needle, it's so important to have friendly people to talk to.</review>< rate>

<review>I had the artist Jared for an appointment for 12:00 PM. I set my appointment months in advance. For starters, it seemed as though he wasn’t even aware of my appointment. When I arrived, he was late by over an hour. Eventually, when we started the appointment, he was extremely unenthusiastic about having me as a client. I honestly didn’t think he wanted to do my tattoo or be at work that day. All of this is okay for another job, but it’s unacceptable for a service based profession. I hope that the other artists at Generation Tattoo don’t treat their clients in the same manner.</review>< pictures>

The finished product is better than I could have imagined. Not only did the artist did a great job of putting my ideas into art, but he was also able to include colors that captured the meaning for me very well. I will definitely be going back. The shop was clean and all of the artists were extremely nice.</review>

Not many things could take up about 7 hours of my life, well over a grand out of my bank account, and put me through so much pain that i nearly (and okay, not so nearly) cry just a little bit and still bring me so much happiness.< /Text>

I've gotten both pierced and tatted at this shop. Super professionals, the only shop that I know that will refund a deposit with enough notice and covers touch ups for life. I know that I will definitely be back. So many talented artist you just want to move from table to table getting inked haha. Can't recommend this place enough.</text>

A clean and well run business with clearly talented artists. The owner would walk around to say hello to clients and see how the artists were going.
I personally had my work done by a guest artist, Vlad. His work is incredible, but it's also easy to see from their Instagram that the local artists are also amazing. This is what attracted me here in the first place, over any other spot around Melrose.< /Text>

They do an amazing service! Allen who did my piercing was very knowledgeable and down to earth. He made my first experience for my nose piercing an amazing one. He was quick and very honest about the piercing, pricing and which one I should get, also how long it would take which I love! Yes the price for choosing your jewelry is a little pricey, but it's for a reason, it's not cheap jewelry. Overall 10/10 I would reccomend! Great experience :) would do it again< /review>

The service was good, the tattoo artist was very nice  but I never had a bad tattoo until I went to this place. It was a small tattoo and within a day or so the ink didn’t even stay in my skin the whole thing scabbed off leaving practically nothing as it healed, so now i’m definitely going to have to get my tattoo redone. I initially thought my tattoo came out good but apparently not. Maybe it was the ink or the artist but I didn’t expect to waste $100 just for the tattoo to come off like that.<//Review>

Amazing place! Came here on a whim because of the great reviews and I cannot be happier with how my tattoo came out! The shop is clean and artists are professional and easy to talk to. My artist worked with my concept and made it a unique piece. Loved the shop- definitely worth the trip!!<//Text>

Cool vibe, easy to walk in. Might have to wait a while depending on how busy it is, but they have a number of artists and do piercings as well.</text>

<Text>I was just on vacation for a week and was shopping on Melrose, I wanted to change my lip rings to hoops and I went into this place. The piercer was great but He charge me $80 for 2 stainless steel lip rings, but I went with it anyway. And the ball fell out the next day and when I went to have them put it back in, no one would even attempt to try and help me. The girl at the front was so rude and dismissive like I was bothering her while she was on her phone and she just kept telling me “nope no one can do it” “nope the piercers not here” “nope no one will try”. Not “I’m so sorry this happened, let me ask anyone that’s here if they could help” or even direct me to another place. I left in tears. It’s sad how one persons attitude can completely degrade a business. I then went to another tattoo place and asked for help, they apologized they couldn’t help but even they took the time to direct me to an amazing shop called “Through your skin”, everyone there was amazing and I am grateful for their need to want to help me and make my day better. When u work in a business like that, you need to enjoy what you do and if you want to be successful, you need to act like you care. So I just want anyone whose doing research to know this is a real review, not someone paid to write a positive one.< /Text><userid>106524894185181802476<//userid>< response>

I got tattooed here yesterday by Frankie.  First off, Frankie rules and I couldn't be more stoked on my tattoo.  He worked with me on the design and really took the time to come up with different ideas to make the design work and it turned out amazing.  Definitely recommend him on every level.</review>

Allen Dabbs is the Master Piercer at Generation 8.

<text>Nothing special. I hate to leave less than good reviews however, not impressed.  Went in with a couple of friends while visiting who said they were recommended to go here. The guy who did my tattoo could have been friendlier. While they do  offer lifetime touchup on tattoos... I have 7 other tattoos, this tattoo was the first that I noticed withing days that I would need an immediate touchup on it, as does my friends, who also got a tattoo that night. Not sure if just the artist or the ink. Place was clean but honestly might just go to my usual tattoo shop and have them redo it instead of dealing with the hassle going back.< /text><username>Alecia Walstrum</username><GmapID>0x80c2bed551f4a105:0x34acf62ce97ba956< /GmapID><Date>1542528833211< /Date></record></dataset><record>

This place is the place to go for a beautifully skilful tattoo. Their in-house artists are generally brilliant, but then they get visiting artists from all over the USA and they are usually superb. So you can't lose by visiting this place. The artist that was there when I was  for my first tattoo was Tim Furlow. He is f*****g amazing. Look him up, see for yourself.< /Review>

<text>My wife and I wanted to get matching tattoos. These guys were awesome, my wife was a bit nervous but our tattoo artist Huka was very accommodating.  Everyone else there was really cool and would come have a chat. Huka did an amazing job of our tattoos. these guys are the place to go in LA.< /text>< gmapID>

I have about 50 in all covering both arms and this just took top spot as my fave!! I enjoyed every moment of my experience here! My artist Chuck was top draw bloke and we had a lot of fun. The care he took of my tatt..the attention to detail..its just perfect! He was super organised, the least painful tattoo ive ever had, changed his gloves maybe 5 times..super impressed. The shop is very clean..and busy!! Guys on reception were very friendly both on the phone and in person. Cant reccomend enough. My tatt is healing so no photo but i live 2 mins away so if anyone wanted to check out the quality of the tatt id be happy to pop down! I also looked in on a couple of the other artists as they were tattooing...really good stuff..one by a guy downstairs just next to reception was doing a spiderman tatt and was awesome..after he was doing Jimi Hendrix and my goodness was epic! Get inked here!!!<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

<review>Went in for a Friday the 13th special. Supposed to be a 2x2 special for $31 and was promoted as an event with food trucks and entertainment. There was no food or entertainment to keep ourselves busy with the incredibly long line. They couldn't even hand out tickets to everyone in line instead they had us all wait and then receive a ticket after filling out paperwork which I never even got to do because I quit after 10+ hrs. The ones who didn't get tatted in time got $31 off their return visit which was not a deal at all for the lengthy line they had to endure without food vendors or entertainment.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This was ridiculous, we waited in line for 13 hours to get a freakin ticket, and then never get called. That is not how you run a business responsibly. If you can’t manage to tattoo so many ppl please don’t advertise that you can. And if you have stopped please notify everyone that you have stopped. People are waiting for your reaponse. At least check your social media account and read the comments. It is understandable that the artists will be tired after working all night but so r ur customers for standing up or sitting on dirty streets for 13+ hours. Have enough respect to notify us about what is going on. Thank you.<//review>< Time>

I so missed Spudnut's while living in Oregon for the last 21 years. I finally got to try them again and they are just as good as they ever were. I prefer them over regular doughnuts any time.</Text>

<Text>Made with potato flour SPUDnuts donuts are delicious! Fluffy, great texture, perfect level of sweetness. My favorite donut. Great made to order hot breakfast sandwiches too! Lovely owners, family run. Behind a jackinbox, skip the chain and try fresh!<//Text>< Pics>

Yummy donuts that the whole family would love. Missing a star because they just don't top KD donuts and these guys are a bit pricey.<//Review>

The whole family likes this place, children and grandchildren. I like that they close on Sundays, they show respect to their employees and God.</review>

I love spudnuts but this particular establishment was unable to process my well funded debit card. So instead of trying it again he proceeded to take my food back. I showed him my bank account which should not be necessary at all and even then he said cash or nothing. The guy working there seemed to have never run a card machine in his life.</text>

<review>I've donated in the past and I've had to call numerous times for a receipt. I was about to go donate more today and called to ask about my receipt for my last donation a few months ago.The lady told me they stopped e-mailing receipts a year ago. I told her it was less than a year ago and she said I'm supposed to do a self-evaluation and hung up on me.

The best customer service ever.

I'll never give them a dime again. I should offer to donated my time and train their staff to be nicer.

AMEN!< /review>< pictures>

Everything you need to host a party, create a costume, grab a packaged costume, decorate inside or outside and all at a fraction of what you would pay elsewhere.

<Review>You can find some incredible deals on unique items. But be careful because the shipping cost can add quite a bit and then it's no longer a good deal. But it's fun and for a great cause so who cares, right!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Yes, their prices are higher than Goodwill and Salvation Army stores but the quality is much higher and well worth the expense if you are a discerning shopper. I especially appreciate that they hang the jeans by approximate size so that I don't have to look at every pair to find the plus sizes. They frequently have buy two get one free sales so I love to shop with a friend and split the savings.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2ba5c8dd8df9b:0x9bee1e59a63b723c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Clean and organized thrift shop. The prices here are higher than other stores like Goodwill but the quality also tends to be higher. Expect to find some designer brands mixed in, and lots of interesting pieces. They offer returns on clothing only, for a few days after purchase if you keep your receipt. Note that you will receive store credit, not cash or refund.

The biggest downside is that there are no fitting rooms. If they changed that I would give them 5 stars.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Quick in n out. Decent small thrift shop. I always surprised that I tend to keep finding designer dress shirts her. A better shop for clothes as the trinkets and other area is pretty small.</Review>

The store is fairly well organized. I felt the workers were disinterested.  I've been to their shop on Fairfax and the workers are way more helpful. Metered street parking only.

Went her today!!! Wasn't expecting to find anything since the Council Thrift Shops in my area don't really have anything good. Left the store with 6 items and only spent $20!! I got a Levi's tshirt and 2 polo tshirt with 2 vintage windbreaker and 1 vintage tshirt!!< /review>

Worst customer service today. Because there's no fitting room, you're forced to buy and then try on at home. Bought some jeans, were to small, exchanged for another pair... those were to big. Went back to exchange again, already a massive hassle. And they wound not let me exchange again. Saying you can only exchange one time. And that is not listed anywhere. There is a sign saying you only have 3 days to exchange but nothing on the one exchange policy. And it's not like I was asking cash back, just for another exchange. What kind of customer service is that to deny it?  What's the reasoning?  Manager just said, that's the policy! I've been in customer service along time and this just blew my mind. I've been going to this thrift store 2/3 a month and now will never return. I ended up just leaving my already paid for jeans that were to big there, no use for them. Thanks a lot people. Happy Holidays</Review>

This place is a rip off they're used items are priced way too high especially that they get donated and used items I wanted to buy some leggings they didn't have a price and the rude little Mexican cashier said she would need to ask came back and said they would cost 18 dollars cause of the brand they look used and were messed up on the knees and had thread coming off I told her 18 dollars and they're messed up and have thread coming off I said no what a rip off a lot of they're clothes look so used and want high prices some you can buy cheaper new at the mall and marshalls this place is a rip off the cashier is rude and the store smells and is messy< /Review>

Not too much selection. Check prices, some things cost more than new. Great donation receipt program period they mail you a great receipt for your taxes.< /review>

The items are indeed overpriced, and not the best of any thrift store I've been in. I do donate to them, but don't get anything. One good thing about donating is that they send you an actual valuation for your donation and are quite generous with their estimates.
The one good thing I've gotten there is wine glasses: we are extremely hard on our glassware, and I pick them up there for about $1.00 a glass.
There is a thrift store on Washington Blvd. across the street from the Sony studios which is outstanding: check that one out. I got a $395.00 pair of Arche boots for $10.00. I doubt they were worn more than once or twice. Their stuff is amazing...< /text>

<text>5/7/2016 - Recently visited this go to location of the Council Thrift Shop and the cashier was sooooo rude. Generally speaking this is not the 1st time they've conducted themselves this way. The cashier accused me of changing price tags on two simple white vases that I purchased. The thing is...there was a group of 4, had I changed the tag on them ALL why wouldn't I buy them all. After I brought this to her attention, she stated that ppl change tags all the time and she'd priced them earlier at double the price. This was sooo surrealing to me. I won't patronize this shop any longer.

Purchased 3 large/extra long scarves and a shorter one. Only complaint is that pricing isn't consistent...Eric is very helpful and always willing to meet you halfway on pricing of most items.  This location is much more affordable than their Hollywood location.< /text></record>

<text>I have been to many T-Mobile stores and they have all been really helpful and good. This one stands out to me out of all the other ones for 2 reasons. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, and they have some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. Darnell and Anthony are both great. They are extremely knowledgable, patient and helpful. If you are a T-Mobile customer or thinking of becoming one, make sure to come to this store!</text>< pictures>

Such a NIGHTMARE with T-mobile with the service and their liability! I opened an account here with a contract plan in 2006. I was asked to pay a SECURITY DEPOSIT $75. After a long time with T-mobile, 6 years and 3 months, I switched to a prepaid plan. The day I ended the contract, I asked a Rep if I could get a refund for the security deposit. The Rep told me it’d take about 4-8 weeks to be mailed to my address. Okay…no problem. After about 4 months of waiting, nothing came. I decided to call a customer care service.  A Rep told me it was not shown in the system. She told me to go to a T-mobile store and show a contract paper to a representative. I came to this store. My bad experience began. A guy treated me like I was a bad customer. C’mon…I paid a full bill every time and never be late. He told me it was not a security deposit. It’s for a smart access fee. What??!!! I was shocked. I’m pretty sure when I opened the account, a Rep said it would be refunded after ending the contract and no breaking rules. More importantly, it says clearly in the contract that it’s a “Security Deposit”. If I knew that a deposit from T-mobile would never be refunded, I’d go with another carrier.  I’m screwed! Never be doing a business with T-mobile again…ever.</text>

<review>Though sometimes this location can be very busy, I've never had a single issue with their customer service.  Just think about how many folks these employees have to help out on a daily basis.  As far as I'm concerned, they've gone overboard to assist me, even though I've pestered them quite a bit when I first switched over from AT&T.

Be patient and polite, and you'll get the same treatment.<//review>< username>

< Review>
Universal Donuts is a small coffee-donut shop located on small plaza by Santa Anita ave and the 10 freeway. They offer a wide variety of sandwiches, donuts, coffee, smoothies and juices. I came here on a cloudy Friday morning to grab breakfast. It’s atmosphere was welcoming and was greeted by a  friendly staff, a young dude. I ordered Vietnamese Ice coffee, glasses donut and item #7, a Turkey, egg, avocado and bacon croissant sandwich. Sandwich was soft, warm and tasty. Similarly, their donut and ice coffee tasted good. Service was moderately fast. Staff were attentive and amiable. Prices were really affordable and competitive. Parking lot was small but I had no issue finding a spot. Overall I had a nice order experience and food/drink. I highly recommend this place if you’re in the area.</Review>

This is the donut place of donut places.  The donuts here are always so soft and taste so good never taste greasy. The person who works here the sweetest guy .   Prices average as all donut shops more less.</text>

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mom and son bakery. They are both so friendly, especially the son. I really enjoy his sense of humor. My favorite item is the veggie crossiant. I am really impressed how the items are placed in the crossiant. It's like a pattern. I also love the fact that salt ans pepper are added to my sandwich. It adds a little extra razzle dazzle.</Review>

<Text>IVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR OVER 20YRS... THEY MAKE AMAZING  DONUTS AND THEY ALSO HAVE ICE CREAM, DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRINKS, AND SANDWICHES!!! THEY ARE WAYS ADDING DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE MENU. WHICH I LOVE BECAUSE WHO DOESNT LOVE A VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM? THEY ONLY COMPLAINT I CAN SAY I HAVE IS THAT THEY DO NOT GO OUT OF THE WAY TO MAKE U FEEL WELCOMED. THEY ARENT RUDE OR ANYTHING   BUT U JUST FEEL LIKE  U NEED TO GET IN AND OUT .. NO FRIENDLY HELLOS OR SMILES JUST ORDER .. PAY .. AND LEAVE. LIKE I SAID EVERYTHING IS GREAT AND WORTH WHAT U PAY (which is pretty fair) ID RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ALL DAY... BUT ID DROP IN MORE OFTEN IF A FRIENDLY FACE WAS WAITING BEHIND THE COUNTER WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR.....JUST SAYING😊😁😍< /Text></record>

I'm not from CA and I didn't know about the whole Discount Tire/America's Tire thing. I wanted my tires rotated and the representative I talked to let me know that they would have to charge me but America's Tire would rotate them for free. I am so grateful for the honesty instead of trying to make money off of me. That honesty is a sign of a great company.< /text>

Best tire shop west of the Mississippi. Jim has serviced our family's cars for almost 20 years. Fair, reasonable and honest. Just had a set of Continental Extreme Contact Sport tires installed. Car runs like a dream!<//text>

LOCAL BUSINESS AT ITS BEST!!
I was here a year ago after a downfall with Big o Tires. Those guys made me wait forever, had horrible customer's service, and most importantly, they didn't notice, advised or care to fix one of the bolts broken on one of my rear wheels. Discount Tire not only completed the service, but noticed the broken/missing bolt while rotating the tires, gave me proper advise and had the problem fixed in record time. Excellent customer's service and super-reasonable prices. Support this wonderful local business, stop waiting in line for under standard service in Big-o-Tires and bring your car here for service. They not only have a great selection of new tires, they will also do the complete oil change and basic scheduled maintenance your vehicle may need. 5 STARS!!< /Text>

<date>1550327424721</date><Review>Great Customer Service - Jim, Brandon and Melissa are great to work with. They keep you up to date on the status of your vehicle. I recently went in to get my shocks and tires replaced for my truck. I've done a few modifications to the truck so I was a little concerned that the aftermarket parts would make the job a little more difficult for the team. But they assured me that they had the experience and knowledge to get the job done right. Whenever they had a question or needed to do something different, Jim called me to let me know what was going on and waited until I was comfortable with the approach before doing anything. When I brought my truck home, there was a noise coming from one of the tires and when I called them back, Jim had his team come out and pick up my truck to look at it. Turns out it was a rock that got caught between some moving parts. He took care of it right away and dropped it back off to me. The team at Discount Tire went the extra mile to make sure I got the highest level of customer service.

This was my second vehicle I brought to them. What brought me back the second time do my truck was the excellent customer service I got the first time when I went there to purchase a set of tires for my other car.

Discount Tire has consistently had great customer service. I'd recommend their business to any of my friends or family looking for a great price and service for their vehicles.</Review>< gmapID>

<text>Jim and Melissa are amazing. Not only do they care about the product they sell but they truly care for the customer.
Jim and Melissa are amazing. Not only do they care about the product they sell but they truly care for the customer. It’s clear that Jim understands the importance of kindness In our world today. I witnessed him extending thoughtful and kind words to a customer dealing with a medical concern. In this day and age it’s so important for us to see others extend themselves.< /text>< pics>

Then Melissa rang me up and was very patient with me and my three kids, explaining different tire and insurance options. Another guy who worked there gave my daughter the remote control so they could choose something on tv, most places will not do that, same old boring news. I could tell this team was strong. They stuck to their ideals and it showed.</Text>< pics>

<review>I normally go to this tire shop.   The guy seems honest, however I bought tires and an alignment.  I took the car and it pulled to the right, brought it back the next day and he immediately corrected the alignment. What upsets me is when I first called about the alignment, I was challenged and appeared to be making excuses why my Cadillac was all of a sudden pulling.  He adjusted it and it drives just fine, as it did before the alignment.  however a week later (after the tire cleaner faded) the tire is grey and splotchy.  I call to tell them that the one tire on the car is discolored, I got the story how he needs to call the distributor to discuss the issue and call me back.  Since I have had several issues, I ask to have an appointment since I have already had to go back and he said he doesn't make appointments.   We all know the tire shop has tires and that he should just replace the tire as it is defected because a brand new tire is not black.  They should have known when the tire was installed  and he should just say come in and lets replace it. Needless to say, if he does replace the tire, I will no longer take my vehicle in to that shop.</review><Name>Tracy Sutton - Kasamoto< /Name></record>

Always great, friendly service. Sometimes things take a bit longer there than other shops, but it's because these guys are more thorough (and trustworthy) than most, bringing in more customers. Absolutely worth any wait outside of emergencies.</Review>

I bought my tires here three years ago. It is now time to get new tires. I moved to San Leandro but am going to Concord to Discount Tires because they have the best prices around and GREAT service. Three years ago I brought my 1 1/2 old grandson and he was fully entertained in their childrens play area.< /Text>

This place is awesome!  Called around about 2 weeks ago for a new tire for my 2012 328i after a flat (no spare), with everyone quoting me 120-250...went to Discount and was charged 60 bucks and service was quick.  Just left today for them replacing my breaks...front pads, rotors sensors AND labor 380....can't beat it!  Awesome customer service!< /Review>

<review>I have been buying tires from Jim for years and hope to for many to come.  Jim is a man of his word and has always stood behind the service and products he has given to me.  His prices are very competitive.  Hope you have checked out his three different payment options he provides on his alignments.  All three are great!  I recommend Discount tire !< /review><time>1507521571481< /time>< Rating>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I've been going to Discount Tires for almost 20 years and 4 vehicles.   They are extremely caring and honest,  always looking for the best deals for my wallet.  I had my taken my  commuter car in for issues it was having.  They found some major front end problems that could have caused me an accident at some point.  I dropped my car off with them and they took me back to work.  They brought it back to me at the end of my day.  I walked outside and immediately saw that it had two new tires that I did not say I wanted.  I was told that they were not charging me for them because Jim, the owner,  knew I didn't have the funds but, he felt my safety meant more than the price of the tires.  I have never heard of a shop doing something like that.  I recommend  this tire shop to everyone I know.  Thank you Jim!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Honestly this place is a gem. I live and work in Berkeley, but I make the trip out  to Concord because they consistently provide quality vehicle service and fantastic customer service. It can be a daunting task to find an honest mechanic, which is why I’m happy to leave this review in support of discount tires.  If you’re looking for a place for oil changes/ brakes/ or any full service issues like check engine lights or tune ups for the maintenance of your vehicle, and want honest experts in the field who appreciate your business and honor your needs, then I strongly recommmend discount tires!<//Review>

Jim and Anthony have taken care of my vehicle time and time again. The willingness and assistance that this place offers is unbelievable. I have been living in California for a couple years now and this has been the only honest place I have come across. Whether you are looking for tires and/or labor I challenge you to come here and see what the can offer before going somewhere else.< /review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Daniel J.<//name><Review>I own a Honda hybrid sedan. Over the past 15 years I’ve had a few flat tires and some slow-leaking tires. Every time I drove my car into a Honda dealership shop, they told me the punctured tire was “irreparable” and had to be replaced with a new tire…for a hefty price.

Recently I discovered a slow leak in one of my rear tires. I drove into Discount Tire one morning with no reservation. Jim’s mechanic was able to remove the puncturing object, repair the puncture, reseal, re-inflate and re-balance the tire…all free of charge — since “these are our tires,” as Jim kindly informed me. I had forgotten that Discount Tire installed a new set of four tires on my car three years ago, with a promise of lifetime flat repairs, lifetime re-balance, and lifetime rotations.<//Review>< date>

I was in and out in no time.  I went to America's Tires in Concord to fix a slow leak in my rear tire and was told it would be a 2 to 2.5 hours wait.  I went about a block or two down the road and saw Discount Tires.  Asked if they could fix it and they took me right in.  I was out is just a few minutes.< /Review>

Best storage  I've ever been to this place kept my motorcycle clean cool and protected from all the harsh elements of the Earth very clean facility I had no problems here at all apparently had to end my subscription due an accident  but in the future if I ever need a storage I would definitely come here again. Thank you to the management and staff for professional atmosphere.<//review>

Been coming here for years. Always been great. Clean, climate control, easy access. And got a great price! Used lots of places. Would never consider another now. And more than anything are the people here. Erica is great, Donovans a good guy too. Highest recommendation!< /Text>

<review>The manager, Erika, was amazingly helpful, and went above that to have an authentic human connection. The facility is clean and well kept. I'm so happy with my experience and will recommend life storage going forward.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Recently rented a unit here at Life Storage. Super easy to reserve on line and then tour the unit in person. Erika G. who handled my reservation was really helpful and friendly. She answered my endless questions and explained everything clearly. The facility is clean, aisles wide and well lit. Part of reason I chose Life Storage was the extended access hours,  5am to 11pm. Very secure faculty with passcode required to enter property, again to enter building and to access elevator. Highly recommended.<//text>

I must say that the property here at this location is very well kept and the MGR Erika is very professional. It’s nice to see that MGRs still care and take pride in their work and aim to provide quality service for their customers.< /text>

<text>If I could leave less than a star i would.
Very expensive, they pack so many vehicles in that the spaces are smaller than what you pay for, the truck trying to park next to my rv backed right into it causing 3g worth of damage. While waiting to get it repaired, it got broken into and more damage was done to the locks and ignition.  LIFE STORAGE REFUSED to give the police the video footage of the break in after I made a report. What is the point of  the expensive "secured area" with "surveillance" of you refuse to use the footage when it is needed? Ridiculous business and waste of money.FALSE ADVERTISING!You are better parking on the side of the road for free...same safety< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>I decided to check out this storage facility today and was very impressed. Upon entering the office I was greeted immediately by Erika and Jesus. I was given a tour of the facility, and it is very nice as far as storage places go. The facility has 24/7 surveillance and has access until 11 PM. It isnt overrun with homeless or pests the way other places are.</review>< pictures>

<review>My experience at Life storage is absolutely awesome since management changed. I’ve been at this storage location over 20 years and finally I feel comfortable being here. I have had the opportunity to work with Donovan and he is the best. I wish you could clone him, it would make the experience here at Life Storage the best ever. Please keep him around, I love his attitude and patience. The facility is clean and I feel safer than before.</review>< gmap_id>

<text>Sorry if this review gets lengthy but this has to be  the best experience I've had with a storage facility!  The  5 star reviews prior to mine are exactly the experience I've had. Erika is just amazing! She really looks out for you and goes well beyond her job description. Shes kind, honest and has great customer service skills. She doesn't pressure you into a unit or space, unlike some facilities. While I've considered downsizing and moving to a new facility for cost, I don't think I will do to Erika and the customer service I've received.The storage is also nice! Its clean, secure and has late night access hours. The storage prices are competitive with other facilities but you get extra care with the customer service here.  I'm staying! Thanks Erika<//text>< Pictures>

Hands down, best storage facility ever! I just can’t say enough about Erika, the amazing store manager, and her incredible team!  Stanley and Donovan are super helpful and always available to answer any questions and concerns. I’ve been here for over a year and have never had a single issue - the facility is kept super clean, access is always easy and convenient and I always feel safe. If you need a storage spot in the Torrance area, look no further!<//review>

<review>My family and I have been renting storage from this location for about 5 years. About 2 years ago the ownership changed and I'm way overdue in giving my 5 star review.

On several occasions the store manager, Erika, has shown her professionalism and wonderful customer service skills when I have interacted with the front desk.

If anyone asks, I always recommend the Normandie Torrance Life Storage location as a safe well managed place to keep their treasures.</review><Time>1555644945954< /Time>< gmap_id>

<Text>THE BEST EXPERIENCE!
Moving is a daunting experience. I recently relocated from the east coast to Torrance, CA. I was dreading looking for storage. I knew about Life Storage from back home and decided to give them a try. It was an excellent choice.

I was greeted by the manager, Erica, who instantly put my stresses and worries to bed. She was warm and very knowledgeable. She employed the help of her associate, Donovan, to give me a tour of their facility. He too was very professional, positive and reassuring.

I would highly recommend Life Storage to anyone as I think (particularly at their Torrance location) they have a competent team of professionals who make the unsavory much easier to bare. They are smart and honest and I never felt pressured into getting a unit that didn't serve my needs.

A five star review!!!</Text>< Name>

Absolutely brilliant. Because of my crazy moving around I lost my keys and Donovan found them and returned them back to me! Thank you so much for saving me! I recommend Life Storage to everyone who needs storage!</Review>

For the 2 yrs I've had space here, my experience has been great. Cyrus, Donavan, and Erika have been nothing but helpful, patient and courteous every time I've come in. The space was very clean and security measures are good. I would recommend Life Storage on Normandie in Torrance ,CA to anyone. Very convenient!

The staff at LifeStorage of Torrance were really helpful with making sure I understood the policies and terms of having a storage unit. The units are well kept and easily accessible. The one thing a I love about his storage place is that you are able to access your unit from 5am-11pm everyday. It makes it easier for me to feel like I don't have to pick and choose what I put in my storage. I have more time to go back and forth as I please. The prices are really great too which just adds to the fact the LifeStorage of Torrance was a good choice for my first storage unit.<//Review>

<Review>To simply describe this place and my experience here so far with only one word...I would have say: "awesome!" This place is probably one of the cleanest storage facilities you will ever store your stuff in. Not to mention the great amenities they have right on the spot. Need to mail something off at the post office? Well you won't have to walk far, because they have a branch pretty much in the same office. Need a drop off site for UPS pickup? Boom, they got that. Along with the convenient amenities, you'll also receive fantastic customer service. Jennifer, who happened to be the one helping me with my rental unit, was both very friendly and very helpful with getting me acclimated with the facility and finding the most practical way to my storage unit. Overall, this is a great storage place for either business and/or personal needs. Would definitely recommend this place.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>110371040709466088588</user_id><time>1450422362639< /time><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>5<//Rating><gmapID>0x80c2caa9ca2206b7:0x7939e2d27256b2e<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have to say that since I was referred to Life Storage I have nothing but complements. Jennifer the manager in Torrance has provided superior customer service. My friend and I have had a unit for nearly 9 months and I can't imagine trusting any other company to our belongings. ﻿Even one time when they changed the codes to get into the building, I was able to reach Jennifer after 10:00 pm to get an override code to get back into my unit. ﻿</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2caa9ca2206b7:0x7939e2d27256b2e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I made a reservation for this location and I spoke to Jennifer Moore on the phone " The Store Manager". She was so helpful over the phone and let me know what time she would be in the office so I could see the unit I was interested in. She was very knowledgeable, professional and kind. I love my my Unit and so happy I choose Lifestorage.<//Text>

<review>Website pricing not completely accurate (retail location will round-up to the nearest dollar) but still good promo price for the space nonetheless.  But hey, the company will make a killing upping how many customers???!!!  Damn!  Everyone should make it standard biz practice to skim all their customers!?  Be aware of the OUTRAGEOUS mandatory insurance (however it's worded legally) premium at $20/month or bring proof of goods coverage from an alternate carrier.  Do your math - total monthly due may not be so wonderful.  Bring a lock.  Ample parking, gated site, clean space, clean elevator.  Sometimes the hand trunks are tied and locked, sometimes not, but it's always available.  Don't expect much - "corporate office" reps suck; staff at site do what they can and may.  And this review is a one-time $10 credit towards my account.</review><Time>1464740474548< /Time><rating>3</rating></record>

The facilities are really clean and the staff is helpful.  I looked at 4 different storage facilities before deciding on LifeStorage of Torrance.  The rates are competitive and I am very satisfied.</review>

Store my RV their for over 4 year's, first had my wheel covers stolen, and was told the camera for that side was out so couldn't see who stole them that was about two years ago, just went to check my RV and found out someone broke in and stole some valuables, and again their cameras were not working plus this place is a gated storage, a lot that helps. So this place is not safe to store your RV! Got a feeling it was a inside job, cause someone knows how to get inside RVs without out doing damage to doors or Windows and their cameras are never working when something happens. I feel that very suspicious???? And they always  say they will call you back and never do!!!!! Very angry customer 😠<//text>

Went in to Lifestorage to inquire about a unit and the costs. I was not sure what I would need, however I knew I needed a quick solution to help de-clutter my living situation. I was greeted by Cyrus who was very kind. I was then introduced to the Store Manager, Jennifer, who traversed the rental process with me.  She put in a effort to give me the best deals possible and appeared very genuine in assisting me. Unlike some of their competitors she took the time to explain everything in detail even offering to show me the units personally if I was still unsure of the size requirements. Service was absolutely exceptional and I was ecstatic.

I love the staff here, my experience made me feel like they are very friendly and looking out for their guests. My decision was made much more secure knowing that this team would be here for me and my storage unit needs.<//Text>

Troy and Donovan are awesome guys, they went way out of their way to help me find a space, couldn't of asked for better guys to help me out, the storage space is very clean and well organized, happy to be there, Life Storage is lucky to have these employees.
Hope this post helps other people to rent space form this location.< /Review>

Chose this location for late access. They increase your rental every year. Don't be forced to take their insurance. You can get a carrier online starting at $5.<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I canceled my membership on March 4th with Terra. I was just recently charged once they opened back up so she never canceled my account. I have been trying to call them for a week and the calls go straight to a voicemail box that has been full the whole week, or just rings once and the call ends. This is the most unprofessional gym I have ever dealt with I get we are in the middle of a pandemic but your doors are open and professionalism should be kept at ALL times especially with such a large business. I moved 4 hours away now and cannot just go into the gym. I have already filed a complaint with corporate and I definitely would not recommend this gym.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Wanna get ripped off then this is the place for you! They closed our branch and are refusing to refund money even though we all got letters in the mail saying that ANY prepaid services would be refunded. I called them multiple times and it took them over a week to get back to me. Some people got refunds (people I know and signed up with me) but of course not everyone. Every time I called I got a different reason why my refund wasn't going to happen. Moral of the story they will take ur money and run I do not reccomend this place for anyone.<//text>

Facilities are nice but management is terrible. Never have I had associates belittled in front of me as a customer by management. I was being assisted with a membership issue where the manager had to be contacted. Management arrived with an attitude towards the associates and me as the customer. Being an advid gym goer it's a nice facility but I removed my business for the sole fact of how the upper management (female) treated her employees, to add I believe her name started with a J.</review>

The gym gets the job done but weights are everywhere! My last gym was organized and weights were where they belong. Staff should make rounds in an effort to keeps weights where they belong. It would probably encourage people to rerack. People wont do it if, “it isn’t done anyway, so why bother.”
Mostly, not too bad of a gym.</text>

They are certainly improving.  Most recently they hired a guy to clean the mens locker room - which up to this point has been disgusting.  But the new guy is doing a great job to keep it clean, though a few of the patrons aren't helping...  They also have replaced some of the nautilus 'type' equipment - i'm not sold on the brand they went with though, not nearly as good as Hammer Strength, etc.  Spin classes are great - their instructors play the BEST tunes!  To the In-Shape CEO - Please continue to invest in this club - maybe a locker room rehab next?<//review>

I love this place! I look forward to going everyday. There's this great lady that always seems so eager to know about my progress and she's such a great motivator. I'm not a big fan of the trainers. They seem way too stuck up. I mostly just ignore them. Every time I went before I became a member, they were NEVER pushy about becoming a member. They were all about letting me check it out without any sales hooks. They had so much confidence in their facility that they let it sell itself. And it did, at least for me. The sales rep that processed my paperwork was so cool and laid back; and granted my friend, a current member at the time, the $50 promotional gift card.</Review>

<text>May I suggest updating the system? Imagine this..instead of having someone check us in at the front desk install a entrance door that's always locked for security (after member sign up ours, and late afternoon/over night) and has a key sensor that can only be opened with the members key card. That way you can really be open 24/7, not have to worry about lock up, and could use those hours for those members sitting at the front desk to do a better job making sure people put their weights back. I wouldn't mind paying a little extra for more flexible hours at the gym.<//text>< Resp>

Quite frankly it is difficult to rate this gym on one hand it is a great gym because it has an indoor swimming pool, hot tub and a sauna all in one area where you can walk freely in between. And, no sign up is required to use these services. But on the other hand the gym equipment is very outdated; some of the machines squirk when used but they do their job no doubt about it. The gym is for all types of people very athletic to not athletic. There is absolutely zero discrimination here. It is a very welcoming and friendly environment. Their team is very friendly and professional. They greet you with a smile and are happy to assist when needed. I do suggest the management to do some renovations it will definetly take this gym to a whole new level. Overall a very nice place and I will continue to be a member.< /review>

Total scam read their contract carefully staff will completely lie to you about actual cancelation process they only care about getting new members and getting your checking account info.. be prepared for quite a surprise when it comes time to cancel be prepared to pay an additional 2-3 months after canceling they will keep pulling out of your account until you write letters to corporate and request a freeze from your bank their prices are outrageous go to fitness evolution instead 9 bucks monthly brand new top of the line equipment<//Review>

Furthermore, I joined this gym for their basketball court, and aside from the terrible condition of the court (hallow spots all over the hardwood, low hanging lights that disrupt shots, etc), apparently the court isn't open during prime usage hours for basketball players and is instead given to yogo classes.

Clean, well equipped, friendly staff!  I've never had an issue with In-shape or the kids daycare.  My children love the staff!  As with any place you sign a contract...read it, read it and read it again!</Review>

<Review>A large complex. Has 1 full basketball ct. That I like.  Needs more of those locking barbell machines(the ones where u don't need a spotter) they only have 1 and I'm always waiting to use it. Big negative is that they have the gay bath house type of showers. C'mon guys this ain't ancient Rome. Install some simple panels n shower curtains.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I went to In-Shape to downgrade and end my membership. The lady charged me 10 dollars and promised everything was taken care of. I later found out, she never fixed my account and she was never suppose to charge me 10 dollars. When i asked for a refund of the 10 dollars and etc on my account I was told upper management would give me a call back and they never did. I guess dishonesty is a part of the culture of in shape.< /review><UserId.>104315258344274888655<//UserId.></record>

<text>The rep I talked to was extremely polite and offered a 7 day free trial to get a feel for the gym. I'm out of town for work and just looking for a place to work out. It's a very nice and clean gym with plenty of equipment and free wifi. I just wish the month to month memberships were cheaper, still debating on this place or VQ (for a short term membership it's a toss up for me).<//text>< Pics>

Weights never get reracked after use by most members. It is not the staffs fault but they could set the tone by hitting different areas of the gym and rerack the weights more often. This could lead the actual members to do it themselves. Also the layout needs to change. I wish the free weights were in the open area and the machines in the room. It's too crowded in the weight room< /text>

The gym is small first of all.  The equipment is outdated, broke, doesn't work correctly.  It looks like someone just threw all of it together to call it a gym.  Being from another city perhaps I'm spoiled into what I think a gym should be.  But needless to say its good if you just want to do cardio.  If your goals are anything else, good luck to you.  Especially if the place is packed.  They have only one piece of exercise equipment for each body part.  Theres only one leg extension, hamstring curl, pec deck, its sad.  I went late at night and it was ok.  But theres no way you can get a decent workout in a decent amount of time during a busy part of the day.</Text>

Not a bad place to work out. The only big complaint I have is that a treadmill or a piece of cardio equipment will break or the headphone jack on that equipment will break and it goes unfixed for a long time. Even after I will tell the front desk. The people at the front desk will then look and act like I am inconveniencing them. Little to no effort is made there.</review>

This review is solely based on customer service. About 2 weeks ago my friend gave me a 45 day pass for InShape. I was pretty excited to get to workout with my friend as many of those 45 days as we could push ourselves to do (I'm not really a gym person). So I went into InShape last week to claim the 45 day pass. I was attended by Jay, one of the sales associates I suppose. He was friendly and all but very persistent in getting me to sign up for a gym membership. After several attempts to refuse his offers, I finally gave in. I signed up for a three year membership at 34.99 a month, at least that's what I was told, for after I reviewed my paperwork, I noticed Jay had written 39.99. He also told me that I had ten days to cancel and that I would still get to keep my 45 days, which is all I wanted to begin with. So, nine days later I walk into the gym to cancel my membership. I hadn't even assisted to exercise all but one day. So there I am in the managers office. I told her I wanted to cancel my membership and get my 45 day pass, now a 36 day pass. Welp, I was denied the pass. Mr. Jay had the audacity to tell me, in front of his manager, that I had 5 days to cancel and still claim the 45 day pass. He basically lied to me in order to get me signed up. Why didn't he just validate the 45 day pass??? I probably would've only assisted half of those free days anyway (if that). The manager bitterly told me that she was going to cancel my account but that I could not keep the free pass, regardless of what Jay said because it violated company rules. She also told me that my account was going to be charged anyway and that I would later receive a refund. The problem here is that I wasn't going to have enough funds in my account to cover the cost. I really don't understand why these people couldn't just keep their word to begin with. Why did I have to deal with Mr. Jay's slip? In the end, isn't customer service about making your customer happy, so that they can potentially return to you or recommend your services to other people? Overall I think they need to reevaluate their customer service program. They need to get their act together and retrain their sales personnel. It is not fair for a customer to have to deal with the mistakes of their staff. This is the first review I've written on a business, in my life. This is how frustrating this situation has turned out to be to me. Grr, I even asked if there was another manager I could speak to. Blah, this concludes my review. I hope it helps.<//review>

This placed is really packed out in the afternoons. It is difficult to get barbells as it is really crowded in the afternoons. The bathrooms and showers are not that clean.
They need to expand the free weight area.< /Text>

I am a doordash driver. Today I came in with a big order of drinks, about 12 drinks in total. These people were so thoughtful, they actually gave me a large box to hold all the drinks instead of a bunch of small drink carriers. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that. Thank you for thinking about the drivers.</text>

<rating>2</rating><review>Lady was kinda rude and lazy. Tried to order through the drive through but what I wanted was online order only. (Not her fault obviously) So I drove to the parking lot and ordered online and there is no place to put special instructions so I called and asked and she refused because she  “already closed the box”. But I also put a request for it to be done a little later so I would have time to request those instructions. And when I walked in to pick up my order it was dirty with receipts all over the floor. Idk just not a good vibe at all.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Food is good but this order I just got was leaving me hungry. I ordered chips and cheese and the little bag was less than half full about 5 chips in it. I mean how could they not notice.< /review>

Dismayed at the news of the removal of your GREEN SAUCE. I managed to incorporate the Bean Burrito with Green sauce into my diet years ago because of the soft texture. (Except for the onions. Can't have everything, right?) I'll wait patiently for is return. In the meantime, Burrito Supreme, extra cheese, extra sour cream, extra meat.< /review>

I just went to this taco bell and there was no one at the front. Someone who worked there said "do you know how to use those" and pointed to the new touch screens. I said "they are not vegetarian or vegan friendly. I need to substitute meat and this doesn't allow me to do that." And they replied "well no one is at the front to help you" and walked away. Vegetarian and vegan costumers are discriminate on a daily basis and turned away or not served. I will never be returning after this experience.</text>

Go there weekly and never had bad service. Today me and my girlfriend have been beat. Our crunchwraps were so stuffed we couldn’t even finish them. Thank you Tuesday morning crew for defeating us in culinary combat. Thank you all of Herndon Road Taco Bell staff for always giving us consistent and excellent customer service!< /Review>

Great visit, order received in a timely manner. Unfortunately even though it was slow in the dining room and the drive throw was busy. The area of the condiments and napkins was in disarray. And also there was a couple of dirty tables. Well other than that, it was so pleasant visit. Take care,✌️<//review>

Taco Bell is well known around my house. One of our got to foods when the day starts running out. Less then 2 miles away from any location I might be at when we decide to have fast food. Not bad tasting,and a little something for everyone. It has a part of every food group,and nobody complains. Thanks Taco Bell..</review>

Tex-mex food, good for a quick bite to dine in or on the go. Friendly and patient staff, food is served hot and tastes fresh. Their newly upgraded dining area looks nice, makes for a cozy atmosphere.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I come here with my husband and mother-in-law for breakfast and the employees are pleasant, patient, and helpful. We specifically come to this one instead of another one closer to our house because of the freshness of the food at that time in the day. I rarely have to come back for a mistake in my order and they have always been quick and polite when correcting my order. The only complaint is that it shares a parking lot with Starbucks, which makes it difficult to park some mornings.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Name>Heather Elliott</Name><user>104071446482462409241< /user></record>

<Review>I came through the drive through today and as I was ordering I was taking a second to figure out what I wanted there was no line and it really hadn't even been that long but I could hear two employees speaking about me how I was taking too long I told them I could hear them and they try to tell me I was wrong when I clearly heard them and my girlfriend heard them so We left and called to complain then the manger tells me that they were listening to the headset and that nothing was said! That their was nothing she could do because she didn’t see or hear it? Isn’t that why we can call to complain to bring it to you’re attention not because you’ve seen It. It was just a horrible experience I would hire some more professional workers and watch who you put in management. Number one thing they teach you is the customers always right< /Review>< date>

I put in an order online around 12am to be picked up at 1:15am. The time at the store location as well as the website says they close at 2am. I'm here at the drive thru & they are already closed, I called they hung up on me & then took the phone off the hook. I can't wait to reach out to corporate headquarters !!!<//text>

<Text>THE WORST TACO BELL LOCATION I HAD EVER BEEN TO!!!! IM SO DISTURBED! THE SO CALLED MANAGER THREATENED TO CALL THE COPS ON ME AFTER SHE YELLED AT ME BECAUSE THEY SERVED ME A CHEESE QUESADILLA THAT WAS NOT COOKED AND HAD LITERALLY A SPRINKLE OF CHEESE WHICH SHE SAID SHE DID. SHE SAID YES I PUT A SPRINKLE OF CHEESE AND I COOKED IT FOR 17 SECONDS! I REPLIED SO  BASICALLY  YOU SERVED ME TORTILLA SHE SAID SORRY THATS HOW WE MAKE THEM! SHE HAD THE WORST MANAGEMENT ATTITUDE EVER. AT THIS POINT IM PIST SO I MADE FUN OF HER LISP BY TELLING HER TO GIVE ME MY FOOD AND SHE GOT REAL UPSET AND SAID TO LEAVE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CALL THE COPS FOR MIMICKING HER TELL ME SHE DIDN'T COOK MY FOOD PROPERLY AND INTENTIONALLY PUT A SPRINKLE OF CHEESE THATS HER WORDS BY THE WAY AND BANNED ME FROM TACO BELL LOL THIS IS INSANE! SHE IS A YOUNG HISPANIC WOMAN WITH BRACES AND HAS A LISP WHEN SHE TALKS! I WILL BE TAKING THIS TO CORPORATE THERE SHOULD BE BETTER WAYS TO MANAGE A SITUATION SUCH AS MINE.<//Text></record>

What you expect from a Taco Bell- fast, cheap food. The only problem is that the bathrooms(single person) aren't locked by employees. You may have to wait on bums shooting up in the bathroom to finish in order to use them.< /review>

Not a big Taco Bell fan compared to real Mexican food but I think for the price the good customer service in the quick-service it's well worth it. What I really like is a double chalupa really good well recommended.</Text>

Julia the manager does NOT care about the customer. She will only back up the employees, no matter how big the mistake is. She is far from manager material and needs major training in customer service.< /Text>

If you're in a car, going through the drive thru, then you'll be pleased. But if you go inside, then be ready to wait. Four to one. Drive thru vs counter.<//text>

Food fresh and tasty. The chalupa box special with 2 tacos included. Fluke possibly but drive thru failed me this visit, so I had to park and order inside. No big. Just hungry.</Text>

<Review>3 soft super tacos waited 15 minutes.   Yup orders going out the drive thru but not the dining area.

I get them and have learned to check the food due to being handed the wrong orders prior.   Yes multiple times.

My tacos have meat across.  Cheese across.  A pile of tomatoes and a gobe  of sourcream at the end.    Taco Bell has been making tacos for YEARS and the can not figure out how to distribute the fillings across a tortilla.

So I got a bite of sour cream . A mouth full of tomatoes and the rest was meat n cheese.

For the chef or cook.
We plan on eating the products u put together.   It's not good enough to make sure all the ingredients are there.   It's not a kit we build ourself.   Or eat in stages.  Its food that when prepared correctly tastes wonderful. Not separate bites of ingredients.  Look at the photos and take note the ingredients come out both ends of a taco.</Review>< Pictures>
